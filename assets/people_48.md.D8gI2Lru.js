These machines are ruled out in most models of computation. More formally, a Zeno machine is a Turing machine that takes 2‚àín units of time to perform its n-th step; thus, the first step takes 0.5 units of time, the second takes 0.25, the third 0.125 and so on, so that after one unit of time, a countably infinite (i.e. ‚Ñµ0) number of steps will have been performed. The idea of Zeno machines was first discussed by Hermann Weyl in 1927; the name refers to Zeno's paradoxes, attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea. Zeno machines play a crucial role in some theories. The theory of the Omega Point devised by physicist Frank J. Tipler, for instance, can only be valid if Zeno machines are possible.  Zeno machines and computability  Zeno machines would allow some functions to be computed that are not Turing-computable. For example, the halting problem for Turing machines can be solved by a Zeno machine (using the following pseudocode algorithm): begin program write 0 on the first position of the output tape; begin loop simulate 1 successive step of the given Turing machine on the given input; if the Turing machine has halted then write 1 on the first position of the output tape and break out of loop; end loop end program Computing of this kind that goes beyond the Turing Limit is called hypercomputation, in this case hypercomputation through a supertask ‚Äì see there for further discussion and literature.

Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended Brooklyn public elementary schools and graduated from Grover Cleveland High School, Queens, New York in 1946. Ambro earned a B.A. from New York University in 1955. He was married on June 11, 1955, to Helen McCooey, with whom he had three children, Cathleen Ambro DeRolf, David Ambro and Richard Ambro. His second wife was Antoinette Salatto. Career Ambro served in the United States Army as a member of the Military Police from 1951 to 1953 where he attained the rank of sergeant. Ambro served the town of Huntington as a budget office and purchasing and personnel director from 1960 to 1967. Later, he served on the Suffolk County, New York Board of Supervisors from 1968 to 1969. From 1968 to 1974 he served four terms as Supervisor for the town of Huntington. He was simultaneously chairman of Huntington's Urban Renewal Agency, as well as president of Freeholders and Commonalty of the Town of Huntington. In 1970, Ambro challenged Basil Paterson for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of New York, but was defeated in the primary election. Elected as a Democrat to the 94th, 95th and 96th United States Congresses, Ambro served from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1981. He led the Democratic Party to its first sweep of Huntington elections in 35 years. While Ambro was in office, the town of Huntington became the first municipality to ban the use of the pesticide DDT. During his first term in the House, Ambro was elected president of his 82-member freshman class. Ambro served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee and was elected chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment. Ambro played a major role in winning the preservation of wetlands in Massapequa, New York, and having Brookhaven National Laboratory designated as the site of a high-energy reactor. In 1980, Ambro authored an amendment to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (Section 106(f)) to require that the disposal of dredged material into Long Island Sound from any federal project, or from any non- federal project exceeding 25,000 cubic yards (19,000 m¬≥), comply with the environmental criteria for ocean dumping under the MPRSA, in addition to the requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Narrated by Peter Falk, the subject of the documentary is a group of juvenile delinquents and their three-hour session with actual convicts. Filmed at Rahway State Prison, a group of inmates known as the \\"lifers\\" berate, scream at, and terrify the young offenders in an attempt to \\"scare them straight\\" (hence the film's title), so that those teenagers will avoid prison life. The documentary aired on television in the late 1970s, uncensored; it marked the first time that the profane words \\"fuck\\" and \\"shit\\" were broadcast on many networks. Some broadcasters (an example being CFQC, a CTV Network affiliate in Canada) added locally produced segments in which experts discussed both the content of the documentary and the rationale behind airing it uncensored. The documentary received several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It found that most of the participants did not reoffend. However, studies that compared and evaluated the effects of various Scared Straight programs against a control group have concluded that they are not effective at deterring crime.  Overview  Teenagers in this documentary and the 1980 sequel, Scared Straight! Another Story, ranged from 15- to 19-year- old repeat offenders of crimes ranging from petty theft and public intoxication to gambling, counterfeiting, and racketeering. None of the \\"graduates\\" of the original documentary have since been convicted of a felony except for Angelo Speziale, who in 2010 was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the rape and murder of his neighbor in 1982 (after the film was made). Most were from the tri-state (Connecticut, New Jersey and New York) area and agreed to accept the experiment in lieu of jail time and/or probation/public service. The producers asked for a range of youth that came from poor inner-city neighborhoods to the affluent suburbs of New York City. The \\"Lifers\\" featured in the film were primarily convicted of murder, while others were in for armed robbery, and some committed both. At film's end, the teenagers say that they have decided that they don't want to end up in jail. The film ends with a \\"roll call\\" of the teens, revealing that most were \\"scared straight\\", though a few were said to have reoffended.  Reception  As a result of the film, many states introduced \\"scared straight\\" programs in an attempt to rehabilitate young delinquents. However, the effectiveness of such programs has been questioned. See Criticism section below. = Awards = The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1978. It also won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement‚ÄìInformational Program and Outstanding Informational Program.  Preservation  The Academy Film Archive preserved Scared Straight! in 2007.  Follow-ups  The original Scared Straight! was followed by Scared Straight! Another Story (1980), Scared Straight! 10 Years Later (1987), and (on MTV and UPN) Scared Straight! 20 Years Later (1999). On January 13, 2011, A&E; introduced the new series Beyond Scared Straight, executive produced by Arnold Shapiro and Paul Coyne. According to the A&E; website profile for the series: \\"Each one-hour episode focuses on a different inmate-run program in the U.S., and follows four or five at-risk teens before they attend the program, throughout their day inside the prison, immediately afterwards, and then follows up with them one month later to see the lasting impact of the experience on their lives. Beyond Scared Straight is about transforming the lives of young people through intervention and second chances.\\" In addition, each episode ends with updates of the teen participants since the taping of the program, citing both successes and some failures in their post-prison behavior, and unfortunate news of passings or incarcerations that happen if teens end up down this path. On February 1, 2011, the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange reported that one of the graduates of the original Scared Straight! program at Rahway, Angelo Speziale, later became a convicted felon. In 2010, Speziale was convicted of the 1982 rape and murder of Michele Mika, a teenage girl who lived next door to him, and is currently serving a sentence of 25 years to life in Rahway. In Scared Straight: 20 Years Later, Speziale claimed that the Scared Straight! experience changed him, although he admitted in the film that he had failed to lead a straight life. \\"I broke the law three times after I visited Rahway. Twice right after, still at the age of 17 and 18, and then about five years ago, I did fifteen days in the county jail for disorderly conduct.\\" He was later arrested for shoplifting in 2005 and a DNA sample linked him to the 1982 cold case rape/murder that led to his imprisonment. A New Jersey law enforcement source has confirmed that Speziale is the same person who appeared in both documentaries. On August 18, 2011, A&E; premiered the second season of Beyond Scared Straight, once again in the midst of controversy. Joe Vignati, director of Justice Programs at the Governor's Office for Children and Families in Georgia, writes at the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange: \\"After becoming the highest rated program in the history of the Disney-owned A&E; network, a new season of this 'reality' show returns to titillate the curious and misinformed.\\"Vignati, Joe. \\"Joe Vignati On Beyond Scared Straight and the Irresponsibility of the A&E; Network\\" . Juvenile Justice Information Exchange, accessed August 19, 2011 Also, in light of the Speziale case, the Campaign for Youth Justice has petitioned A&E; to cancel Beyond Scared Straight because they claim that the show promotes \\"the spread of a noxious program\\" and may be in violation of federal law and standards set forth by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).  Criticism  In April 1978, James Finckenauer, a professor of the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, began a test of the Scared Straight program, using a control group, something that had not been done previously. His study concluded that children who attended Rahway were more likely to commit crimes than those who did not. A meta-analysis of the results of a number of Scared Straight and similar programs found that they actively increased crime rates and lead to higher re-offense rates compared to control groups that did not receive the intervention. The cause of the increase in crime is not clear. The UK College of Policing agrees that there is \\"very strong quality\\" evidence that Scared Straight programs cause an increase in crime. Two Justice Department officials have written an op-ed piece describing scared straight programs as \\"not only ineffective but is potentially harmful\\" to the kids involved. The op-ed appears in the edition of February 1, 2011 of the Baltimore Sun, written by OJJDP Acting Administrator Jeff Slowikowski and Laurie O. Robinson. They say that, \\"when it comes to our children\\", policymakers and parents should \\"follow evidence, not anecdote\\".Laurie O. Robinson and Jeff Slowikowski. \\"Scary -- and ineffective\\" . Baltimore Sun. January 31, 2011 In 2004 the Washington State Institute for Public Policy estimated that each dollar spent on Scared Straight programs incurred costs of $203.51.  Cultural references  Television series' Hardcastle and McCormick had an end of first season episode called \\"Scared Stiff\\" in which teenage boys were taken to a state prison to scare them out of further crimes as did Get a Life first season's \\"Bored Straight\\" episode. Married... with Childrens sixth season \\"Rites of Passage\\" has Al saying how the Department of Juvenile Corrections bused some juveniles to his shoe store and made them spend over 3 hours watching Al work to show why it was so important to stay out of trouble and in school until even the most hardened punk was \\"crying like a baby\\". In 1984, the syndicated animated series The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids used the Scared Straight! formula in the episode \\"Busted.\\" There, after the main protagonists are arrested for being accessories to grand theft auto -- they had accepted a ride from their new friend, Larry, who admits only after initiating a police pursuit that he had just stolen the car -- the police sergeant and court agree to drop the charges against the Cosby Kids ... but only after giving them a tour of a maximum-security prison, where the kids are frightened by the inmates and their behavior. In the end, the Cosby Kids vow to stay out of trouble and promptly disassociate with Larry. Between 2008 and 2012, Saturday Night Live satirized Scared Straight!-type programs in a series of eight sketches. In the third season episode of Arrested Development entitled \\"Notapusy,\\" a former prison inmate mistakes a gay conversion therapy seminar entitled \\"Startled Straight\\" for a Scared Straight!-type program and lectures the group of men about the horrors of incarceration, especially the prevalence of homosexual prison sex. \\"A Date with the Booty Warrior,\\" a third season episode of The Boondocks, features a group of children participating in a program called \\"Scared Stiff.\\" However, the program is subverted when the children and prisoners collaborate to organize a prison strike. Rap artist GZA utilised samples of Peter Falk's narration for the song \\"Path of Destruction\\" from the album Pro Tools. Comedian Tom Segura referenced the Scared Straight episode of 1999 that he claims \\"aired once\\" in his Netflix comedy special Mostly Stories. In the Beavis and Butt-Head episode \\"Scared Straight\\", Beavis and Butt-Head are sent to prison for a day as part of a Scared Straight program. They end up befriending some inmates who share their passion for heavy metal music, and decide to sneak back in to stay longer. In the Drake & Josh episode ‚ÄúSteered Straight‚Äù, Drake Parker and Josh Nichols are sent to jail as part of a program that‚Äôs similar to Scared Straight.

It was established in 1997, in opposition to a summit of the European Council at which the Treaty of Amsterdam was signed. A small school was squatted for the purpose of holding a 'counter summit' as a protest over the official EU summit. From that, a more permanent anarchist project evolved which was of national importance. Eurodusnie (English: \\"Euro? No way!\\" as well as being a pun on Eurodisney) ran a number of projects in Leiden. The collective also convened the second European Peoples' Global Action (PGA) conference in 2002. School Eurodusnie squatted a hotel in Noordwijk in 1997 but were quickly evicted. They then occupied a former school in Leiden on the Boerhaavelaan. This became both a place to live for members of the collective and an activity centre with many public events. Freespace The Eurodusnie collective became involved with the Vrijplaats Koppenhinksteeg (English: Freespace on Koppenhinksteeg street) a complex of buildings first squatted in 1968. The group ran an information centre, a vegan caf√© and a free shop. It published a zine called 'Dusnieuws' and a magazine entitled 'Geen Paniek' (Don't Panic). Animal rights week Eurodusnie put on an animal rights week in April 1998. This involved picketing McDonald's fast food stores, workshops and a benefit concert at the Vrijplaats. The picket of the McDonald's on the Beestenmarkt on Saturday 11 April caused a disturbance. A Swedish demonstrator was arrested and another was bitten by a police dog. The picket then moved to the McDonald's on the Donkermansteeg. The activists also targeted the dolphinarium in Harderwijk and a company called Pharming which was cloning cows. When the demonstrations received negative press, Eurodusnie said that they were not actually the organisers, they were hosting a group called the Dutch Animal Rights Coalition. Pieing Eurodusnie was associated with several actions to pie politicians. Firstly in 1998, Mayor Van der Sluijs of Noordwijk was pied, to say thanks for the eviction of the hotel since Eurodusnie were now very happy with their base in Leiden. The action was claimed by a group called TAART - Tegen Autoritaire en Antirevolutionaire Types (English: 'Against Authoritarians and Antirevolutionary Types' also 'taart' means 'cake' in Dutch). Next, former European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein (in 1998), Minister of Finance Gerrit Zalm (in 1999) and Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) were all pied. The pieing of Zalm happened because it was not possible to reach the initial target, the President of De Nederlandsche Bank Nout Wellink since activists posing as reporters for the fictitious Arnhems Dagblad newspaper were not allowed into a press conference. When Pim Fortuyn was assassinated, some of his supporters targeted Eurodusnie as they blamed leftwing groups for his murder. A spokesperson for Eurodusnie said about the murder \\"We were stunned. We are against violence and absolutely reject it.\\" Eurodusnie denied that they had been involved with the pieing of Fortuyn, saying the action had been made by the Biotic Baking Brigade and asked for police protection, since they were receiving threatening phonecalls. The police declined to intervene and the same night, the windows of the squatted school on the Boerhoevelaan and the windows of the free shop on the Koppenhinksteeg were broken. Nobody was arrested. Right to the city Leiden Council began in 2001 to remove young people, homeless and alcohol drinkers from the city parks, including the Burcht van Leiden. To protest this, Eurodusnie organised a party at the castle on 2 June, 2002. There was music, drumming, drinking and fire-eating. At 23.30 the police asked for the party to stop and at midnight it was violently evicted. This became a scandal at the council, with an independent witness blaming the police for being heavy- handed. Subsidy The political parties CDA, Lijst Pim Fortuyn and VVD complained in 2005 that Eurodusnie was receiving a subsidy of 40,000 euro from the Referendum Commission to campaign against the European Union. With the money the group planned to organise a festival with music and debates.

The product is a substituted alkene with the double bond shifted to the allylic position. Figure 1 - the ene reaction This transformation is a group transfer pericyclic reaction, and therefore, usually requires highly activated substrates and/or high temperatures. Nonetheless, the reaction is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups that can be appended to the ene and enophile moieties. Many useful Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions have been also developed, which can afford high yields and selectivities at significantly lower temperatures, making the ene reaction a useful C‚ÄìC forming tool for the synthesis of complex molecules and natural products.  Ene component  Enes are œÄ-bonded molecules that contain at least one active hydrogen atom at the allylic, propargylic, or Œ±-position. Possible ene components include olefinic, acetylenic, allenic, aromatic, cyclopropyl, and carbon-hetero bonds. and references therein Usually, the allylic hydrogen of allenic components participates in ene reactions, but in the case of allenyl silanes, the allenic hydrogen atom Œ± to the silicon substituent is the one transferred, affording a silylalkyne. Phenol can act as an ene component, for example in the reaction with dihydropyran, but high temperatures are required (150‚Äì170 ¬∞C). Nonetheless, strained enes and fused small ring systems undergo ene reactions at much lower temperatures. In addition, ene components containing C=O, C=N and C=S bonds have been reported, but such cases are rare.  Enophile  Enophiles are œÄ-bonded molecules which have electron-withdrawing substituents that lower significantly the LUMO of the œÄ-bond. Possible enophiles contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, acetylenes, benzynes), carbon-hetero multiple bonds (C=O in the case of carbonyl-ene reactions, C=N, C=S, C‚â°P), hetero-hetero multiple bonds (N=N, O=O, Si=Si, N=O, S=O), cumulene systems (N=S=O, N=S=N, C=C=O, C=C=S, SO2) and charged œÄ systems (C=N+, C=S+, C‚â°O+, C‚â°N+). Mechanism =Concerted pathway and transition states= The main frontier-orbital interaction occurring in an ene reaction is between the HOMO of the ene and the LUMO of the enophile (Figure 2). The HOMO of the ene results from the combination of the pi-bonding orbital in the vinyl moiety and the C-H bonding orbital for the allylic H. Concerted, all-carbon-ene reactions have, in general, a high activation barrier, which was approximated at 138 kJ/mol in the case of propene and ethene, as computed at the M06-2X/def2-TZVPP level of theory. However, if the enophile becomes more polar (going from ethane to formaldehyde), its LUMO has a larger amplitude on C, yielding a better C‚ÄìC overlap and a worse H‚ÄìO one, determining the reaction to proceed in an asynchronous fashion. This translates into a lowering of the activation barrier until 61,5 kJ/mol (M06-2X/def2-TZVPP), if S replaces O on the enophile. By computationally examining both the activation barriers and the activation strains of several different ene reactions involving propene as the ene component, Fernandez and co-workers have found that the barrier decreases along the enophiles in the order H2C=CH2 > H2C=NH > H2C=CH(COOCH3) > H2C=O > H2C=PH > H2C=S, as the reaction becomes more and more asynchronous and/or the activation strain decreases. Figure 2. Concerted mechanism for the ene reaction The concerted nature of the ene process has been supported experimentally, and the reaction can be designated as [œÉ2s \\\\+ œÄ2s \\\\+ œÄ2s] in the Woodward-Hoffmann notation. The early transition state proposed for the thermal ene reaction of propene with formaldehyde has an envelope conformation, with a C‚ÄìO‚ÄìH angle of 155¬∞, as calculated at the 3-21G level of theory. Schnabel and co-workers have studied an uncatalyzed intramolecular carbonyl-ene reaction, which was used to prepare the cyclopentane fragment of natural and non-natural jatropha-5,12-dienes, members of a family of P-glycoprotein modulators. Their DFT calculations, at the B1B95/6-31G* level of theory for the reaction presented in Figure 3, propose that the reaction can proceed through one of two competing concerted and envelope-like transition states. The development of 1,3-transannular interactions in the disfavored transition state provides a good explanation for the selectivity of this process. Figure 3. DFT study (B1B95/6-31G*) of a thermal intramolecular carbonyl‚Äìene reaction and its use in the synthesis of jatropha-5,12-dienes The study of Lewis acid promoted carbonyl-ene reactions, such as aluminum-catalyzed glyoxylate-ene processes (Figure 4), prompted researchers to consider a chair-like conformation for the transition state of ene reactions which proceed with relatively late transition states. The advantage of such a model is the fact that steric parameters such as 1,3-diaxial and 1,2-diequatorial repulsions are easy to visualize, which allows for accurate predictions regarding the diastereoselectivity of many reactions. Figure 4. Chair-like transition state proposed for Lewis-acid catalyzed carbonyl-ene additions =Radical mechanism= When a concerted mechanism is geometrically unfavorable, a thermal ene reaction can occur through a stepwise biradical pathway. Another possibility is a free-radical process, if radical initiators are present in the reaction mixture. For example, the ene reaction of cyclopentene and cyclohexene with diethyl azodicarboxylate can be catalyzed by free-radical initiators. As seen in Figure 5, the stepwise nature of the process is favored by the stability of the cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl radicals, as well as the difficulty of cyclopentene and cyclohexene in achieving the optimum geometry for a concerted process. Figure 5: Stepwise, free-radical pathway for the ene reaction Regioselection Just as in the case of any cycloaddition, the success of an ene reaction is largely determined by the steric accessibility of the ene allylic hydrogen. In general, methyl and methylene H atoms are abstracted much more easily than methine hydrogens. In thermal ene reactions, the order of reactivity for the abstracted H atom is primary> secondary> tertiary, irrespective of the thermodynamic stability of the internal olefin product. In Lewis-acid promoted reactions, the pair enophile/Lewis acid employed determines largely the relative ease of abstraction of methyl vs. methylene hydrogens. The orientation of ene addition can be predicted from the relative stabilization of the developing partial charges in an unsymmetrical transition state with early formation of the œÉ bond. The major regioisomer will come from the transition state in which transient charges are best stabilized by the orientation of the ene and enophile. Internal asymmetric induction In terms of the diastereoselection with respect to the newly created chiral centers, an endo preference has been qualitatively observed, but steric effects can easily modify this preference (Figure 6). Figure 6. Endo preference for the ene reaction Intramolecular ene reactions Intramolecular ene reactions benefit from less negative entropies of activation than their intermolecular counterparts, so are usually more facile, occurring even in the case of simple enophiles, such as unactivated alkenes and alkynes. The high regio- and stereoselectivities that can be obtained in these reactions can offer considerable control in the synthesis of intricate ring systems. Considering the position of attachment of the tether connecting the ene and enophile, Oppolzer has classified both thermal and Lewis acid- catalyzed intramolecular ene reactions as types I, II and III, and Snider has added a type IV reaction (Figure 7). In these reactions, the orbital overlap between the ene and enophile is largely controlled by the geometry of the approach of components. Figure 7: Types of intramolecular ene reactions. Lewis acid ‚Äì catalyzed ene reactions =Advantages and rationale= Thermal ene reactions have several drawbacks, such as the need for very high temperatures and the possibility of side reactions, like proton-catalyzed olefin polymerization or isomerization reactions. Since enophiles are electron-deficient, it was reasoned that their complexation with Lewis acids should accelerate the ene reaction, as it occurred for the reaction shown in Figure 8. Figure 8: Improvements brought to the ene reaction by Lewis acid catalysis Alkylaluminum halides are well known as proton scavengers, and their use as Lewis acid catalysts in ene reactions has greatly expanded the scope of these reactions and has allowed their study and development under significantly milder conditions. Since a Lewis acid can directly complex to a carbonyl oxygen, numerous trialkylaluminum catalysts have been developed for enophiles that contain a C=O bond. In particular, it was found that Me2AlCl is a very useful catalyst for the ene reactions of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, as well as of other aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. The reason behind the success of this catalyst is the fact that the ene-adduct- Me2AlCl complex can further react to afford methane and aluminum alkoxide, which can prevent proton-catalyzed rearrangements and solvolysis (Figure 9). Figure 9: Me2AlCl-catalyzed carbonyl-ene reactions In the case of directed carbonyl-ene reactions, high levels of regio- and stereo-selectivity have been observed upon addition of a Lewis acid, which can be explained through chair-like transition states. Some of these reactions (Figure 10) can run at very low temperatures and still afford very good yields of a single regioisomer. Figure 10. Lewis acid catalyzed, directed carbonyl-ene reaction. =Reaction conditions= As long as the nucleophilicity of the alkyl group does not lead to side reactions, catalytic amounts of Lewis acid are sufficient for many ene reactions with reactive enophiles. Nonetheless, the amount of Lewis acid can widely vary, as it largely depends on the relative basicity of the enophile and the ene adduct. In terms of solvent choice for the reactions, the highest rates are usually achieved using halocarbons as solvents; polar solvents such as ethers are not suitable, as they would complex to the Lewis acid, rendering the catalyst inactive. =Reactivity of enes= While steric effects are still important in determining the outcome of a Lewis acid catalyzed ene reaction, electronic effects are also significant, since in such a reaction, there will be a considerable positive charge developed at the central carbon of the ene. As a result, alkenes with at least one disubstituted vinylic carbon are much more reactive than mono or 1,2-disubstituted ones. =Mechanism= As seen in Figure 11, Lewis acid-catalyzed ene reactions can proceed either through a concerted mechanism that has a polar transition state, or through a stepwise mechanism with a zwitterionic intermediate. The ene, enophile and choice of catalyst can all influence which pathway is the lower energy process. In general, the more reactive the ene or enophile-Lewis acid complex is, the more likely the reaction is to be stepwise. Figure 11: Mechanisms of Lewis acid- catalyzed ene reactions Chiral Lewis acids for the asymmetric catalysis of carbonyl-ene reactions =Chiral dialkoxytitanium complexes and the synthesis of laulimalide= A current direction in the study of Lewis acid- catalyzed ene reactions is the development of asymmetric catalysts for C‚ÄìC bond formation. Mikami has reported the use of a chiral titanium complex (Figure 12) in asymmetric ene reactions involving prochiral glyoxylat esters. The catalyst is prepared in situ from (i-PrO)2TiX2 and optically pure binaphthol, the alkoxy-ligand exchange being facilitated by the use of molecular sieves. The method affords Œ±-hydroxy esters of high enantiomeric purities, compounds that represent a class of biological and synthetic importance (Figure 12). Figure 12: Asymmetric glyoxylate-ene reaction catalyzed by a chiral titanium complex Since both (R)- and (S)-BINOL are commercially available in optically pure form, this asymmetric process allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of Œ±-hydroxy esters and their derivatives. However, this method is only applicable to 1,1-disubstituted olefins, due to the modest Lewis acidity of the titanium-BINOL complex. As shown in Figure 13, Corey and co-workers propose an early transition state for this reaction, with the goal of explaining the high enantioselectivity observed (assuming that the reaction is exothermic as calculated from standard bond energies). Even if the structure of the active catalyst is not known, Corey‚Äôs model proposes the following: the aldehyde is activated by complexation with the chiral catalyst (R)-BINOL-TiX2 by the formyl lone electron pair syn to the formyl hydrogen to form a pentacoordinate Ti structure. CH‚ÄîO hydrogen bonding occurs to the stereoelectronically most favorable oxygen lone pair of the BINOL ligand. In such a structure, the top (re) face of the formyl group is much more accessible to a nucleophile attack, as the bottom (si) face is shielded by the neighboring naphthol moiety, thus affording the observed configuration of the product. Figure 13. Transition state proposed for the reaction in Figure 12. The formal total synthesis of laulimalide (Figure 14) illustrates the robustness of the reaction developed by Mikami. Laulimalide is a marine natural product, a metabolite of various sponges that could find a potential use as an anti-tumor agent, due to its ability to stabilize microtubuli. One of the key steps in the strategy used for the synthesis of the C3-C16 fragment was a chirally catalyzed ene reaction that installed the C15 stereocenter. Treatment of the terminal allyl group of compound 1 with ethyl glyoxylate in the presence of catalytic (S)-BINOL-TiBr2 provided the required alcohol in 74% yield and >95% ds. This method eliminated the need for a protecting group or any other functionality at the end of the molecule. In addition, by carrying out this reaction, Pitts et al. managed to avoid the harsh conditions and low yields associated with installing exo-methylene units late in the synthesis. Figure 14: Retrosynthetic analysis of the C3-C16 fragment of laulimalide and use of the ene reaction in its synthesis =Chiral C2-symmetric Cu(II) complexes and the synthesis of (+)-azaspiracid-1= Evans and co-workers have devised a new type of enantioselective C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts to which substrates can chelate through two carbonyl groups. The catalysts were found to afford high levels of asymmetric induction in several processes, including the ene reaction of ethyl glyoxylate with different unactivated olefins. Figure 15 reveals the three catalysts they found to be the most effective in affording gamma-delta-unsaturated alpha-hydroxy esters in high yields and excellent enantio-selectivities. What is special about compound 2 is that it is bench-stable and can be stored indefinitely, making it convenient to use. The reaction has a wide scope, as shown in Figure 16, owing to the high Lewis acidity of the catalysts, which can activate even weakly nucleophilic olefins, such as 1-hexene and cyclohexene. Figure 15. C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts developed for the enantioselective carbonyl-ene reactions of olefins and ethyl glyoxylate Figure 16. Scope of the reaction catalyzed by C2-symmetric Cu(II) chiral Lewis acids In the case of catalysts 1 and 2, it has been proposed that asymmetric induction by the catalysts results from the formation of a square- planar catalyst-glyoxylate complex (Figure 17), in which the Re face of the aldehyde is blocked by the tert-butyl substituents, thus allowing incoming olefins to attack only the Si face. This model does not account however for the induction observed when catalyst 3 was employed. The current view is that the geometry of the metal center becomes tetrahedral, such that the sterically shielded face of the aldehyde moiety is the Re face. Figure 17. Square planar and tetrahedral Cu (II) stereochemical models. Initially, the value of the method developed by Evans and coworkers was proved by successfully converting the resulting alpha-hydroxy ester into the corresponding methyl ester, free acid, Weinreb amide and alpha-azido ester, without any racemization, as shown in Figure 18. The azide displacement of the alcohol that results from the carbonyl ene reaction provides a facile route towards the synthesis of orthogonally protected amino acids. Figure 18. Derivatization of the alcohols afforded by C2-symmetric Cu(II) chiral Lewis acids. The synthetic utility of the chiral C2-symmetric Cu(II) catalysts was truly revealed in the formation of the C17 stereocenter of the CD ring fragment of (+)-azaspiracid-1, a very potent toxin (cytotoxic to mammalian cells) produced in minute quantities by multiple shellfish species including mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, and cockles. As shown in Figure 19, the reaction that establishes the C17 stereocenter is catalyzed by 1 mol % Cu(II) complex 2 (Figure 15), and the authors note that it can be conducted on a 20 g scale and still give very good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Furthermore, the product can be easily converted into the corresponding Weinreb amide, without any loss of selectivity, allowing for the facile introduction of the C14 methyl group. Thus, this novel catalytic enantioselective process developed by Evans and coworkers can be easily integrated into complex synthesis projects, particularly early on in the synthesis, when high yields and enantioselectivites are of utmost importance.

Its rulers were Henry II (ruled 1154‚Äì1189), Richard I ( 1189‚Äì1199), and John ( 1199‚Äì1216). The Angevin Empire is an early example of a composite state. The Angevins of the House of Plantagenet ruled over an area covering roughly half of France, all of England, and parts of Ireland and Wales, and had further influence over much of the remaining British Isles. The empire was established by Henry II, as King of England, Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou (from which the Angevins derive their name), as well as Duke of Aquitaine by right of his wife, and multiple subsidiary titles. Although their title of highest rank came from the Kingdom of England, the Angevins held court primarily on the continent at Angers in Anjou, and Chinon in Touraine. The influence and power of the House of Anjou brought them into conflict with the kings of France of the House of Capet, to whom they also owed feudal homage for their French possessions, bringing in a period of rivalry between the dynasties. Despite the extent of Angevin rule, Henry's son, John, was defeated in the Anglo-French War (1213‚Äì1214) by Philip II of France following the Battle of Bouvines. John lost control of most of his continental possessions, apart from Gascony in southern Aquitaine. This defeat set the scene for further conflicts between England and France, leading up to the Hundred Years' War. Origin of the term and its application The term Angevin Empire is a neologism defining the lands of the House of Plantagenet: Henry II and his sons Richard I and John. Another son, Geoffrey, ruled Brittany and established a separate line there. As far as historians know, there was no contemporary term for the region under Angevin control; however, descriptions such as \\"our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be\\" were used. The term Angevin Empire was coined by Kate Norgate in her 1887 publication, England under the Angevin Kings. In France, the term (French for \\"Plantagenet area\\") is sometimes used to describe the fiefdoms the Plantagenets had acquired. The adoption of the Angevin Empire label marked a re-evaluation of the times, considering that both English and French influence spread throughout the dominion in the half century during which the union lasted. The term Angevin itself is the demonym for the residents of Anjou and its historic capital, Angers; the Plantagenets were descended from Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou, hence the term. The demonym, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, has been in use since 1653. The use of the term Empire has engendered controversy among some historians over whether the term is accurate for the actual state of affairs at the time. The area was a collection of the lands inherited and acquired by Henry, and so it is unclear whether these dominions shared any common identity and so should be labelled with the term Empire. Some historians argue that the term should be reserved solely for the Holy Roman Empire, the only Western European political structure actually named an empire at that time, although Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile had taken the title \\"Emperor of all Spain\\" in 1135. Other historians argue that Henry II's empire was neither powerful, centralised, nor large enough to be seriously called an empire. Furthermore, the Plantagenets never claimed any sort of imperial title as implied by the term Angevin Empire. However, even if the Plantagenets themselves did not claim an imperial title, some chroniclers, often working for Henry II himself, did use the term empire to describe this assemblage of lands. The highest title was \\"king of England\\"; the other titles of dukes and counts of different areas held in France were completely and totally independent from the royal title, and not subject to any English royal law. Because of this, some historians prefer the term commonwealth to empire, emphasising that the Angevin Empire was more of an assemblage of seven fully independent, sovereign states loosely bound to each other, only united in the person of the king of England. Geography and administration At its largest extent, the Angevin Empire consisted of the Kingdom of England, the Lordship of Ireland, the duchies of Normandy (which included the Channel Islands), Gascony and Aquitaine as well as of the counties of Anjou, Poitou, Maine, Touraine, Saintonge, La Marche, P√©rigord, Limousin, Nantes and Quercy. While the duchies and counties were held with various levels of vassalage to the king of France, the Plantagenets held various levels of control over the Duchies of Brittany and Cornwall, the Welsh princedoms, the county of Toulouse, and the Kingdom of Scotland, although those regions were not formal parts of the empire. Auvergne was also in the empire for part of the reigns of Henry II and Richard, in their capacity as dukes of Aquitaine. Henry II and Richard I pushed further claims over the County of Berry but these were not completely fulfilled and the county was lost completely by the time of the accession of John in 1199. The frontiers of the empire were sometimes well known and therefore easy to mark, such as the dykes constructed between the royal demesne of the king of France and the Duchy of Normandy. In other places these borders were not so clear, particularly the eastern border of Aquitaine, where there was often a difference between the frontier Henry II, and later Richard I, claimed, and the frontier where their effective power ended. Scotland was an independent kingdom, but after a disastrous campaign led by William the Lion, English garrisons were established in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick in southern Scotland as defined in the Treaty of Falaise. =Administration and government= One characteristic of the Angevin Empire was its \\"\\" nature, a term taken from a political pamphlet written by a subject of the Angevin Empire: the Policraticus by John of Salisbury. This meant that, rather than the empire being controlled fully by the ruling monarch, he would delegate power to specially appointed subjects in different areas. Britain England was under the firmest control of all the lands in the Angevin Empire, due to the age of many of the offices that governed the country and the traditions and customs that were in place. England was divided in shires with sheriffs in each enforcing the common law. A justiciar was appointed by the king to stand in his absence when he was on the continent. As the kings of England were more often in France than England they used writs more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, which actually proved beneficial to England. Under William I's rule, Anglo-Saxon nobles had been largely replaced by Anglo-Norman ones who couldn't own large expanses of contiguous lands, because their lands were split between England and France. This made it much harder for them to revolt against the king and defend all of their lands at once. Earls held a status similar to that of the continental counts, but there were no dukes at this time, only ducal titles that the kings of England held. Wales obtained good terms provided it paid homage to the Plantagenets and recognised them as lords. However, it remained almost self- ruling. It supplied the Plantagenets with infantry and longbowmen. Ireland Ireland was ruled by the Lord of Ireland who had a hard time imposing his rule at first. Dublin and Leinster were Angevin strongholds while Cork, Limerick and parts of eastern Ulster were taken by Anglo-Norman nobles. France France in 1180. The Angevin kings of England held all the red territories. All the continental domains that the Angevin kings ruled were governed by a seneschal at the top of the hierarchical system, with lesser government officials such as baillis, vicomtes, and pr√©v√¥ts. However, all counties and duchies would differ to an extent. Greater Anjou is a modern term to describe the area consisting of Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Vend√¥me, and Saintonge. Here, pr√©v√¥ts, the seneschal of Anjou, and other seneschals governed. They were based at Tours, Chinon, Baug√©, Beaufort, Brissac, Angers, Saumur, Loudun, Loches, Langeais and Montbazon. However, the constituent counties, such as Maine, were often administered by the officials of the local lords, rather than their Angevin suzerains. Maine was at first largely self- ruling and lacked administration until the Angevin kings made efforts to improve administration by installing new officials, such as the seneschal of Le Mans. These reforms came too late for the Angevins however, and only the Capetians saw the beneficial effects of this reform after they annexed the area. Aquitaine differed in the level of administration in its different constituent regions. Gascony was a very loosely administrated region. Officials were stationed mostly in Entre-Deux-Mers, Bayonne, Dax, but some were found on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela and also on the river Garonne up to Agen. The rest of Gascony was not administered, despite being such a large area compared to other smaller, well-administered provinces. This difficulty when it came to administering the region wasn't new ‚Äì it had been just as difficult for the previous Poitevin dukes to cement their authority over this area. A similar state of affairs was found in the eastern provinces of P√©rigord and Limousin, where there was not much of a royal administrative system and practically no officials were stationed. Indeed, there were lords that ruled these regions as if they were \\"sovereign princes\\" and they had extra powers, such as the ability to mint their own coins, something English lords had been unable to do for decades. The Lusignans, for example, became rivals to the Angevins during John's rule as he attempted to consolidate his power. Officials could be stationed in Poitou, however, due to a large concentration of castles compared to the rest of Aquitaine. Normandy was the most administrated state of the Angevin Empire after England. Pr√©v√¥ts and vicomtes lost their authority to baillis, who held both judicial and executive powers. These officials were introduced during the 12th century in Normandy and cause an organisation of the duchy similar to the sheriffs in England. Ducal authority was the strongest on the frontier near the Capetian royal demesne. Toulouse was held through weak vassalage by the Count of Toulouse but it was rare for him to comply with Angevin rule. Only Quercy was directly administrated by the Angevins after Henry II's conquest in 1159, but it did remain a contested area. Brittany, a region where nobles were traditionally very independent, was under Angevin control during Henry II and Richard I's reigns. The county of Nantes was under the firmest control. The Angevins often involved themselves in Breton affairs, such as when Henry II arranged Conan of Brittany's marriage and installed the archbishop of Dol. =Economy= Chinon Castle, the administrative centre and location of the main treasury in the Angevin Empire. The economy of the Angevin Empire was quite complicated due to the varying political structure of the different fiefdoms. England and Normandy were well administered and therefore would be able to generate larger revenues than areas such as Aquitaine. This is because England and Normandy were home to more officials to collect taxes and, unlike Aquitaine, local lords were unable to mint their own coins, allowing the Angevin kings to control the economy from their administrative base of Chinon. Chinon's importance was shown by the fact that Richard seized Chinon first when he rebelled against his father in 1187, and then when John immediately rushed to Chinon after his brother's death. Money raised in England was used mostly for continental issues. Also, due to the high level of administration of England and, to a lesser extent, Normandy, these areas were the only lands where revenue was consistently and relatively high. The English revenues themselves varied from year to year. When financial records begin in 1155 to 1156, the annual income of England was ¬£10,500, or around half what the revenue had been under Henry I. This was due in part to The Anarchy and King Stephen's loose rule resulting in the reduction of royal authority. As time went on, royal authority improved and the revenue consequently went up to an average of ¬£22,000 a year. Due to the preparation for the Third Crusade, revenue then increased to over ¬£31,000 in 1190 under Richard. The number fell again to ¬£11,000 a year whilst Richard was abroad. Between 1194‚Äì1198, revenue averaged ¬£25,000. Under Richard's successor John, income fluctuated between ¬£22,000 and ¬£25,000 from 1199‚Äì1203. In order to fund for the reconquest of France, English income increased to ¬£50,000 in 1210 but then rose to over ¬£83,000 in 1211 before falling back down to ¬£50,000 in 1212. Revenue then fell down to below ¬£26,000 in 1214, and then further to ¬£18,500 in 1215. The first three years of Henry III's reign brought in ¬£8,000 on average due to the fragility the civil war had brought to England. In Ireland, the revenue was fairly low at ¬£2,000 for 1212; however, all other records did not survive. For Normandy, there were a lot of fluctuations relative to the politics of the Duchy. The Norman revenues were only ¬£6,750 in 1180, then they reached ¬£25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England. What was more impressive was the fact the Norman population was considerably smaller than England's, an estimated 1.5 million as opposed to England's 3.5 million. This period has become known as the 'Norman Fiscal Revolution' due to this increase in revenue. For Aquitaine and Anjou, no records remain. However, it is not because that these regions were poor; there were large vineyards, important cities and iron mines. For example, this is what Ralph of Diceto, an English chronicler, wrote about Aquitaine: The Capetian kings did not record such incomes, although the royal principality was more centralized under Louis VII and Philip II than it had been under Hugh Capet or Robert the Pious. The wealth of the Plantagenet kings was definitely regarded as bigger; Gerald of Wales commented on this wealth with these words: Petit Dutailli had commented that: \\"Richard maintained a superiority in resources which would have given him the opportunity, had he lived, to crush his rival.\\" There is another interpretation, not widely followed and proven wrong, that the king of France could have raised a stronger income, that the royal principality of the king of France generated alone more incomes than all the Angevin Empire combined. Formation of the Angevin Empire =Background= The Counts of Anjou had been vying for power in northwestern France since the 10th century. The counts were recurrent enemies of the dukes of Normandy and of Brittany and often the French king. Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, claimed rule over Touraine, Maine and Nantes; however, of these only Touraine proved to be effectively ruled, as the construction of the castles of Chinon, Loches and Loudun exemplify. Fulk IV married his son and namesake, called \\"Fulk the Younger\\" (who would later become King of Jerusalem), to Ermengarde, heiress of the province of Maine, thus unifying it with Anjou through personal union. While the dynasty of the Angevins was successfully consolidating their power in France, their rivals, the Normans, had conquered England in the 11th century. Meanwhile, in the rest of France, the Poitevin Ramnulfids had become Dukes of Aquitaine and of Gascony, and the Count of Blois, Stephen, the father of the next king of England, Stephen, became the Count of Champagne. France was being split between only a few noble families. The Anarchy and the question of the Norman succession In 1106, Henry I of England had defeated his brother Robert Curthose and angered his son, William Clito, who was Count of Flanders from 1127. Henry used his paternal inheritance to take the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England and then tried to establish an alliance with Anjou by marrying his only legitimate son, William, to Fulk the Younger's daughter, Matilda. However, William died in the White Ship disaster in 1120. As a result, Henry then married his daughter Matilda to Geoffrey \\"Plantagenet\\", Fulk's son and successor; however, Henry's subjects had to accept Matilda's inheritance to the throne of England. There had been only one occurrence of a medieval European queen regnant before, Urraca of Le√≥n and Castile, and it wasn't an encouraging precedent; nevertheless, in January 1127 the Anglo- Normans barons and prelates recognized Matilda as heiress to the throne in an oath. On 17 June 1128, the wedding between Matilda and Geoffrey was celebrated in Le Mans.The obverse of Eleanor of Aquitaine's seal. She is identified as Eleanor, by the Grace of God, Queen of the English, Duchess of the Normans. The legend on the reverse calls her Eleanor, Duchess of the Aquitanians and Countess of the Angevins. In order to secure Matilda's succession to the royal throne, she and her new husband needed castles and supporters in both England and Normandy, but if they succeeded, there would be two authorities in England: the king and Matilda. Henry prevented the conflict by refusing to hand over any castles to Matilda as well as confiscating the lands of the nobles he suspected of supporting her. By 1135, major disputes between Henry I and Matilda drove the nobles previously loyal to Henry I against Matilda. In November, Henry was dying; Matilda was with her husband in Maine and Anjou while Stephen, brother of the Count of Blois and Champagne, who was Matilda's cousin and another contender for the English and Norman thrones, was in Boulogne. Stephen rushed to England upon the news of Henry's death and was crowned King of England in December 1135. Geoffrey first sent his wife Matilda alone to Normandy in a diplomatic mission to be recognized Duchess of Normandy and replace Stephen. Geoffrey followed at the head of his army and quickly captured several fortresses in southern Normandy. It was then that a noble in Anjou, Robert III of Sabl√©, rebelled, forcing Geoffrey to withdraw and prevent an attack on his rear. When Geoffrey returned to Normandy in September 1136, the region had become plagued with internal, baronial infighting. Stephen was not able to travel to Normandy and so the situation remained. Geoffrey had found new allies with the Count of Vend√¥me and, most importantly, William X, Duke of Aquitaine. At the head of a new army and ready for conquest, Geoffrey was wounded and was forced to return to Anjou again. Furthermore, an outbreak of diarrhea plagued his army. Orderic Vitalis stated \\"the invaders had to run for home leaving a trail of filth behind them\\". Stephen finally arrived in Normandy in 1137 and restored order but had lost much credibility in the eyes of his main supporter, Robert of Gloucester and so Robert changed sides and supported Geoffrey and his half-sister Matilda instead. Geoffrey took Caen and Argentan without resistance, but now had to defend Robert's possessions in England against Stephen. In 1139, Robert and Matilda crossed the channel and arrived in England while Geoffrey kept the pressure on Normandy. Stephen was captured in February 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln, which prompted the collapse of his authority in both England and Normandy. Geoffrey now controlled almost all of Normandy, but no longer had the support of Aquitaine now that William X had been succeeded by his daughter, Eleanor, who had married Louis VII of France in 1137. Louis was not concerned with the events in Normandy and England. While Geoffrey consolidated his Norman power, Matilda suffered defeats in England. At Winchester, Robert of Gloucester was captured while covering Matilda's retreat so Matilda freed Stephen in exchange for Robert. In 1142, Geoffrey was asked by Matilda for assistance but refused; he had become more interested in Normandy. Following the capture of Avranches, Mortain and Cherbourg, Rouen surrendered to him in 1144 and he then had himself anointed as Duke of Normandy. In exchange for Gisors, he was formally recognised by Louis VII. However, Geoffrey still didn't assist Matilda even as she was on the verge of defeat. After Geoffrey's investment as duke, further rebellion occurred in Anjou, including Geoffrey's younger brother, Helie, demanding Maine. It was during this period of Angevin unrest that Geoffrey then dropped the title of duke and formally invested his son Henry as Duke of Normandy in 1150, though still dominating Norman affairs. =The nominal foundation of the Angevin Empire= Geoffrey Plantagenet, father of Henry II and Count of Anjou. Stephen hadn't given up his claim on Normandy because despite Louis VII recognising Geoffrey, and later Henry in 1151, as duke in exchange for concessions in the Norman Vexin, an alliance with Louis appeared possible. Geoffrey died in 1151, making Henry Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, with title also to Toraine and Maine. According to William of Newburgh, Geoffrey's vassals after his death forced Henry to give an oath that he would hand over Anjou to his younger brother, Geoffrey, if he was to gain the crown of England. This was the senior Geoffrey's dying wish and he had ordered that he be left without sepulture until Henry promised. Henry II of England, the first Angevin king of England In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine had their marriage annulled under the pretext of consanguinity at the council of Beaugency. The terms of the annulment left Eleanor as duchess of Aquitaine but still a vassal of Louis. Eight weeks later she married Henry, thus Henry became duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and count of Poitiers. Now Henry refused to give Anjou to his brother because it would mean splitting his land in two. A coalition of Henry's enemies was formed by Louis VII: Stephen of England and his son Eustace IV of Boulogne (married to Louis' sister); Henry I, Count of Champagne (betrothed to Louis' daughter), Robert of Dreux (Louis' brother) and Henry's brother, Geoffrey, who saw he wouldn't receive Anjou. In July 1152, Capetian troops attacked Aquitaine while Louis, Eustace, Henry of Champagne, and Robert attacked Normandy. Geoffrey raised a revolt in Anjou while Stephen attacked Angevin loyalists in England. Several Anglo- Norman nobles switched allegiance, sensing an impending disaster. Henry was about to sail for England to pursue his claim when his lands were attacked. He first reached Anjou and compelled Geoffrey to surrender. He then took the decision to sail for England in January 1153 to meet Stephen. Luckily enough, Louis fell ill and had to retire from the conflict while Henry's defences held against his enemies. After seven months of battles and politics, Henry failed to get rid of Stephen but then Stephen's son, Eustace, died in dubious circumstances, \\"struck by the wrath of god.\\" Stephen gave up the struggle by ratifying the Treaty of Winchester, making Henry his heir on condition that the landed possessions of his family were guaranteed in England and France‚Äîthe same terms Matilda had previously refused after her victory at Lincoln. Henry became King Henry II of England upon Stephen's death on 25 October 1154. Subsequently, the question was again raised of Henry's oath to cede Anjou to his brother Geoffrey. Henry received a dispensation from Pope Adrian IV under the pretext the oath had been forced upon him, and he proposed compensations to Geoffrey at Rouen in 1156. Geoffrey refused and returned to Anjou to rebel against his brother. Geoffrey may have had a strong claim, but his position was weak. Louis would not interfere since Henry paid homage to him for his continental possessions. Henry crushed Geoffrey's revolt, and Geoffrey had to be satisfied with an annual pension. The Angevin Empire had now been formed. Expansions of the Angevin Empire In the earlier years of his reign, Henry II claimed further lands and worked on the creation of a ring of vassal states as buffers, especially around England and Normandy. The most obvious areas to expand, where large claims were held, were Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and, as an ally rather than a new dominion, Flanders. King David I of Scotland had taken advantage of The Anarchy to seize Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. In Wales, important leaders like Rhys of Deheubarth and Owain Gwynedd had emerged. In Brittany, there is no evidence that the Duke of Brittany, namely Eudes II, had recognised the Norman overlordship. Two vital frontier castles, Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins, had never been taken back by Geoffrey Plantagenet and were in the hands of Robert of Dreux. Count Thierry of Flanders had joined the alliance formed by Louis VII in 1153. Further south, the Count of Blois acquired Amboise. From Henry II's perspective, these territorial issues needed solving. King Henry II showed himself to be an audacious and daring king as well as being active and mobile; Roger of Howden stated that Henry travelled across his dominions so fast that Louis VII once exclaimed that \\"The king of England is now in Ireland, now in England, now in Normandy, he seems rather to fly than to go by horse or ship.\\" Henry was often more present in France than in England; Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St Paul's, said with irony: The situation in 1154 =Castles and strongholds in France= Henry II bought Vernon and Neuf-March√© back in 1154. This new strategy now regulated the Plantagenet-Capetian relationship. Louis VII had been unsuccessful in his attempt to break Henry II down. Because of the Angevin control of England in 1154, it was pointless to object to the superiority of the overall Angevin forces over the Capetian ones. However, Henry II refused to back down despite Louis' apparent change of policy until the Norman Vexin was entirely recovered. Thomas Becket, then the current Chancellor of England, was sent as ambassador to Paris in the summer of 1158 to lead negotiations. He displayed all the wealth the Angevins could provide, and according to William FitzStephen, a Frenchman exclaimed \\"If the Chancellor of England travels in such splendor, what must the king be?\\"\\"An Annotated Translation of the Life of St. Thomas Becket by William Fitzstephen\\", p. 40-41, accessed 8 January 2015. Louis VII's daughter, Margaret, who was still a baby, was betrothed to Henry's heir, his eldest son, Henry the Young King with a dowry of the Norman Vexin. Henry II was given back the castles of Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins. Theobald V, Count of Blois handed Amboise back to him. =Flanders= The relationship between Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders, who had taken part in the assaults against Henry II with Louis VII, and Henry II, who had expelled all Flemish mercenaries after his accession to the throne, was not cordial at first. However, the wool trade between England and Flanders was profitable and meant that the count and Henry favoured a cordial relationship between the two of them. This relationship peaked when the Count appointed Henry guardian of his eldest son, Philip, who had been left as regent, so that he could undertake a pilgrimage to Jerusalem without concern in 1157. In 1159, William of Blois died without an inheritance, he was Stephen's last son, leaving the titles of Count of Boulogne and Count of Mortain vacant. Henry II absorbed the County of Mortain but wanted to grant Boulogne to Thierry's second son, Matthew, who married Marie of Boulogne. The title of Count of Boulogne was accompanied with important manors in London and Colchester. England traded much of its wool with Flanders via the port of Boulogne.\\"(Cf. Davis, King Stephen, 18‚Äì20) At this time the future rival ports of Calais, Dunkirk, and Ostend were blocked by sandbanks, leaving Boulogne as one of the most important continental ports.\\" ‚Äì W.L. Warren, Henry II, p. 16. An alliance with these two counties was then logically sealed by this wedding and the concessions of manors. Henry II had to get Marie out of her convent first, which had been a common practice in England since the Normans. In 1163, the few official remaining documents show Henry II and Thierry renewed a treaty that had been made between Henry I of England, and Robert II of Flanders. Flanders would provide Henry II with knights in exchange of an annual tribute in money, known as a \\"money-fief\\". =Brittany= In Brittany, Duke Conan III declared his son Ho√´l a bastard and disinherited him on his deathbed in 1148. It was his sister Bertha who became Duchess of Brittany making her husband of the time, Eudes, nominally Duke. Ho√´l had to be satisfied as Count of Nantes. Bertha was the widow of Alan de Bretagne with whom she already had a son, Conan. Conan, who had become Earl of Richmond in 1148, was Henry II's perfect candidate to become the future Duke of Brittany after Bertha, as any Duke with possessions of importance in England would be easier to control as they are directly a vassal of the English King. In 1156, Brittany was hit by civil unrest when Bertha died, ending in Conan IV's accession. Meanwhile, in Nantes, the population attempted to oust their Count, Ho√´l, and called on Henry II for help. Geoffrey, Henry's brother, was installed as Count by Henry, but died in 1158. Conan IV then briefly ruled as Count, but Henry took the title that same year by mustering an army in Avranches to threaten Conan. In 1160 Henry's cousin Margaret of Scotland married Conan. Henry then supported Breton independence in 1161 when he secured the Archbishopric of Dol. The jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Tours would have overrun into Brittany if Henry hadn't appealed to Rome. Henry then appointed the archbishop of Dol, Roger du Hommet. Without a tradition of a strong rule in Brittany, discontent grew among the nobles in the years following, culminating in a baronial revolt that Henry II ended in 1166. He betrothed his own 7-year-old son, Geoffrey, to Conan's daughter, Constance, and later forced Conan to abdicate for his future son-in-law, making Henry II the ruler of Brittany, yet not the Duke. Breton nobles strongly opposed this, and more attacks on Brittany occurred in the following years until 1173. Each of these invasions were followed by confiscations, and Henry II installed his men, William Fitzhamo and Rolland of Dinan, in the area. Although it was not formally part of the Plantagenet fiefdom, Brittany was under firm control.J.A. Everard states in Brittany and the Angevins ‚Äì Province and Empire 1158‚Äì1203 p. 31 that \\"The duchy of Brittany was now recognised as forming part of the Angevin Empire\\". =Scotland= Seal of William the Lion, King of Scotland Henry II met Malcolm IV in 1157 about Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland previously seized by his grandfather, David I of Scotland. In 1149, before Henry II became powerful, he made an oath to David that the lands north of Newcastle should belong to the King of Scotland forever. Malcolm reminded him of this oath but Henry II did not comply. There is no evidence that Henry II got a dispensation from the pope this time, as William of Newburgh put it, \\"prudently considering it was the king of England who had the better of the argument by reason of his much greater power.\\" Malcolm IV gave up and paid homage in return for Huntingdon, which he inherited from his father. William the Lion, the next King of Scotland, was unhappy with Henry II since he was given Northumberland by David I in 1152 and therefore lost it to Henry II when Malcolm IV handed it back in 1157. As a part of the coalition set by Louis VII, William the Lion first invaded Northumberland in 1173 and then again in 1174, as a result he was captured near Alnwick and had to sign the tough Treaty of Falaise. Garrisons were to be set in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick. Southern Scotland was from then under firm control just as Brittany was. Richard I of England would end the Treaty of Falaise in exchange for money to fund his own crusade, setting a context for cordial relationships between the two kings. =Wales= Rhys of Deheubarth, also called Lord Rhys, and Owain Gwynedd were closed to negotiations. Henry II had to attack Wales three times, in 1157, 1158 and 1163 to have them answer his summons to the court. The Welsh found his terms too harsh and largely revolted against him. Henry then undertook a fourth invasion in 1164, this time with a massive army. According to the Welsh chronicle Brut y Tywysogion, Henry raised \\"a mighty host of the picked warriors of England and Normandy and Flanders and Anjou and Gascony and Scotland\\" in order to \\"carry into bondage and to destroy all the Britons\\". Bad weather, rains, floods, and constant harassment from the Welsh armies slowed the Angevin army and prevented the capture of Wales (see the Battle of Crogen); a furious Henry II had Welsh hostages mutilated. Wales would remain safe for a while, but the invasion of Ireland in 1171 pressured Henry II to end the issue through negotiations with Lord Rhys. =Ireland= King John's Castle, on the river Shannon There were further plans of expansion considered as Henry II's last brother didn't have a fiefdom. The Holy See was most likely to support a campaign in Ireland which would bring its church into the Christian Latin world of Rome. Henry II was given Rome's blessing in 1155 under the form of a Papal bull, but had to postpone the invasion of Ireland because of all the problems in his domains and around them. In the terms of the Bull Laudabiliter, \\"Laudably and profitably does your magnificence contemplate extending your glorious name on earth.\\" William X, Count of Poitou died in 1164 without being installed in Ireland, but Henry II didn't give up on the conquest of Ireland. In 1167 -Dermot of Leinster- an Irish King, was recognised as \\"prince of Leinster\\" by Henry II and was allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales to use in Ireland against the other Kings. The knights first met great success in carving themselves lands in Ireland, so much it worried Henry II enough to land himself in Ireland in October 1171 near Waterford and confronted to such demonstration of power most native kings of Ireland recognised him as their lord. Even Rory O' Connor, the king of Connacht and High King of Ireland paid homage to Henry II. Henry II installed some of his men in strongholds like Dublin and Leinster (as Dermot was dead). He also gave unconquered kingdoms such as Cork, Limerick and Ulster to his men and left the Normans carving their lands in Ireland. In 1177 he made John, his son, the first Lord of Ireland, though John was too young and landed in Ireland only in 1185. He failed to install his authority on the land and had to return to Henry II. Only 25 years later John would return to Ireland while others built castles and installed their interests. =Toulouse= Carcassonne Much less tenable was the claim over Toulouse, the fortified seat of the County of Toulouse. Eleanor's ancestors claimed the large county, as it had been the central power of the ancient Duchy of Aquitaine in the times of Odo the Great. However Henry II and possibly Eleanor were likely not related to this ancient line of dukes; Eleanor was a Ramnulfid, while Henry II was an Angevin. Toulouse was larger, more heavily fortified, and much richer than many cities of the time. It was of strategic importance, as the largest state of the Kingdom of France, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, and including significant towns such as Narbonne, Cahors, Albi, N√Æmes and Carcassonne. The recurrent conflicts with Toulouse would be called the Forty Years War with Toulouse by William of Newburgh. In June 1159, Henry II's forces gathered in Poitiers. They included troops from all of his fiefdoms from Gascony to England, and reinforcements sent by Thierry and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. Even a Welsh prince joined the fray. The only larger armies of the times were those raised for major crusades. Henry II attacked from the north; his allies the Trencavels and Ramon Berenguer opened a second front. Henry II couldn't capture Toulouse proper since his overlord, King Louis VII of France, was part of the defence and he didn't want to set an example to his vassals or have to deal with keeping his sovereign prisoner. Henry II did capture Cahors along with castles in the Garonne valley in the Quercy region. Henry II returned in 1161, but too busy with conflicts elsewhere in his fiefdom, he left his allies fighting against Toulouse. Alfonso II the King of Aragon, himself having interests there, joined the war. In 1171 Henry II's alliance was bolstered by another of Raymond V's enemies, Humbert of Maurienne. In 1173, in Limoges, Raymond finally gave up after over a decade of constant fights. He paid homage to Henry II, to his son Henry, and to his other son Richard the Lionheart, newly appointed new Duke of Aquitaine. Pinnacle of the Angevin Empire The attacks on Toulouse made clear that peace between Louis VII and Henry II was not peace at all but just an opportunity for Henry to make war elsewhere. Louis was in an awkward position: his subject, Henry, was largely more powerful than he was and Louis had no male heir. Constance, his second wife, died in childbirth in 1160 and Louis VII announced he would remarry at once, in the urgent need of a male heir, with Ad√®le of Champagne. Henry II's son, Henry, two years old, was finally married to Margaret under the pressure of Henry II, and, as declared in 1158, the Norman Vexin went to him as Margaret's dowry. If Louis VII died without a male heir, Henry would have been a strong candidate for the French throne. In 1164, Louis found a dangerous ally in Archbishop Thomas Becket. Louis and Becket had met previously in 1158, but now the circumstances were different; France was already refuge to a few clerical refugees, and Louis was known as Rex Christianisimus (most Christian king), called so by John of Salisbury. Becket took refuge in France, and following this there were growing conflicts between Henry II and Becket. Henry finally provoked Becket's murder in 1170 by announcing, \\"What miserable traitors have I nourished in my household who led their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!\\" Christendom blamed Henry, whereas Louis gained widespread approval due to his protection of Becket. Louis' secular power was much weaker than Henry's but Louis now had the moral advantage. Earliest known portrayal of Thomas Becket's murder in Canterbury Cathedral, where he was archbishop.In 1165, hopes of Henry II's son's future accession to the French throne were dashed when Ad√®le gave birth to a son, Philip. Following this, the fragile Anglo-French peace ended. In 1167, Henry II marched into Auvergne, and in 1170 he also attacked Bourges. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges. At this point, John Gillingham mentions in The Angevin Empire that he believes Louis \\"must have wondered whether there was ever going to be an end to Henry's aggressively expansionist policies\\". Henry II did not treat his territories as a coherent empire as the term \\"Angevin Empire\\" would suggest, but as private, individual possessions that he planned to distribute to his children. Henry, 'The Young King', was crowned King of England in 1170 (though he never ruled); Richard became Duke of Aquitaine in 1172; Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany in 1181; John became Lord of Ireland in 1185; Eleanor was promised to Alfonso VII with Gascony as dowry during the campaign against Toulouse in 1170. This partition of the lands between his children made it much harder for him to control them, as now they could fund their own ventures with their estates and attempt to overrule their father in their respective dominions. Following his coronation, in 1173, Henry, 'the Young King', asked for part of his inheritance, at least England, Normandy, or Anjou, but his father refused. Young Henry then joined Louis at the French court to otherthrow his father together, and his mother, Eleanor, joined the new revolt against Henry II. Both Richard and Geoffrey soon joined their brother. Enemies that Henry II had made previously now joined the conflict with Louis, including King William the Lion of Scotland, Count Philip of Flanders, Count Matthew of Boulogne and Count Theobald of Blois. Henry II emerged victorious; his wealth meant he could recruit large numbers of mercenaries, and he had captured and imprisoned his wife, Eleanor, early on and captured William the Lion and forced him into the Treaty of Falaise. Henry bought the County of Marche, then he asserted that the French Vexin and Bourges should be given back at once. However, this time there was no invasion to back the claim. =Richard I and Philip II= Richard I of England Louis VII died in 1180 and was succeeded by his 15-year- old son, crowned as Philip II. The man who would later become arguably his main rival, Richard, had administered Aquitaine since 1175 but his policy of centralisation of the Aquitanian government had grown unpopular in the eastern part of the Duchy, notably P√©rigord and Limousin. Richard was further disliked in Aquitaine due to his apparent disregard for Aquitaine's customs of inheritance, as shown by events in Angoul√™me in 1181. If Richard was unpopular in Aquitaine though, Philip was equally disliked by his contemporaries with comments describing him as: astute, manipulative, calculating, penurious and ungallant ruler. In 1183, Henry the Young King joined a revolt to overthrow the unpopular Duke Richard, led by the viscount of Limoges and Geoffrey of Lusignan, where Henry would take Richard's place. Joined by Philip II, Count Raymond V of Toulouse, and Duke Hugh III of Burgundy, Henry died suddenly of a fatal illness in 1183, saving Richard's position. Richard, now Henry II's oldest son, became Henry's heir. Henry ordered him to hand Aquitaine to his brother, John, but Richard refused. Henry was busy with Welsh princes contesting his authority, William the Lion was asking for his castles to be given back that had been taken in the Treaty of Falaise, and now Henry the Young King was dead, Philip wanted the Norman Vexin handed back. Henry II decided instead to insist Richard to nominally surrender Aquitaine to his mother whilst Richard would retain actual control. Still, in 1183, Count Raymond had taken Cahors back and so Henry II asked Richard to mount an expedition to retake the city. At the time, Geoffrey of Brittany had been quarrelling violently with Richard and Philip planned to use this, but Geoffrey's death in 1186 in a tournament killed the plot. The next year, Philip and Richard had become strong allies: Philip II of France In 1188, Raymond attacked again, joined by the Lusignans, vassals of Richard. It was rumoured that Henry himself had financed the revolts. Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again. Henry refused to make Richard his heir, with one story reporting that Richard said \\"Now at last, I must believe what I had always thought impossible.\\" Henry's plans collapsed. Richard paid homage to Philip for the continental lands his father held then they attacked Henry together. The Aquitanians refused to help whilst the Bretons seized the opportunity to attack him too. Henry's birthplace, Le Mans, was captured and Tours fell. Henry was encircled at Chinon and was compelled to surrender. He gave a large tribute in money to Philip and swore that all his subjects in France and England would recognise Richard as their lord. Henry died two days later, after learning John, the only son that had previously never betrayed him, had joined Richard and Philip. He was buried in Fontevraud Abbey. Eleanor, who had been Henry's hostage since the 1173-4 revolt, was freed while Rhys ap Gruffydd, ruler of Deheubarth in South Wales, began to reconquer the parts of Wales that Henry had annexed. Richard was crowned King Richard I of England in Westminster Abbey in November 1189, and had already been installed as Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine. Richard demanded Philip surrender the Vexin but then the issue was settled when Richard announced he would marry Alys, Philip's sister. Richard also recognised Auvergne as being in Philip's royal demense and not as part of the Duchy of Aquitaine, as Henry had claimed. The two lion kings, William the Lion, King of Scotland, and Richard, opened negotiations to revoke the Treaty of Falaise and an agreement was reached. =The Third Crusade= The next priority for Richard I was the Third Crusade; it had been delayed since Richard had taken the cross in 1187. This was not just a religious pilgrimage however; his great-grandfather, Fulk had been King of Jerusalem and the current pretender to the throne, Guy de Lusignan was a Poitevin noble, related to many of Richard's vassals, while Guy's wife‚ÄîSybilla‚Äîwas Richard's cousin. The crusade, excluding disputes in France, would be the main reason for Richard's absence from England; he would spend less than six months of his reign in England. alt=Richard and Philip at Acre Before leaving, Richard consolidated his reign over the Empire. He suspected Count Raymond would expand his lands into Aquitaine so he allied with Sancho VI the Wise, the King of Navarre, by marrying his daughter, Berengaria, to counter the threat. They married in 1191 in Limassol, Cyprus, therefore repudiating Alys, Philip's sister, but the issue had been settled earlier in Messina. To placate Philip, Richard had given him 10,000 marks and agreed that if he had two sons, the youngest would take Normandy, Aquitaine, or Anjou and rule it under Philip.F. Delaborde: \\"Recueil des actes de Philippe Auguste\\". The administration Richard left behind worked considerably well, as an attack from Raymond was repelled with the help of Navarre. The siege of Acre, which had been the last Christian stronghold in Holy Land, was over by July and Philip decided to return to France. It is unclear whether Philip returned due to dysentery, anger towards Richard, or that he thought he could gain Artois following the death of the Count of Flanders, as he had married the Count's daughter. Whilst back at France, Philip boasted he was 'going to devastate the king of England's lands' and, in January 1192, he demanded from the seneschal of Normandy, William FitzRalph, the Vexin, claiming that the treaty he had signed with Richard in Messina contained the intention of Richard that, as the Vexin had been Alys' dowry and since Richard had married Berengaria, he was entitled to the land. Although Philip threatened invasion, Eleanor of Aquitaine intervened in stopping her son, John, from promising to concede the land. Philip's nobles refused to attack the lands of an absent crusader, though Philip instead gained lands in Artois. Philip's return did result in castles throughout the empire being in a \\"state of readiness\\". The alliance with Navarre helped again when Philip attempted to incite revolt in Aquitaine but failed. King Richard left the Holy Land over a year later than Philip in October 1192, and possibly could have retrieved his empire intact had he reached France soon after. However, during the crusade Leopold V, Duke of Austria, had been insulted by Richard, and so he arrested Richard near Vienna, on his journey home. Richard had been forced to go through Austria as the path through Provence was blocked by Raymond in Toulouse. Leopold also accused Richard of sending assassins to murder his cousin Conrad, and then handed Richard over to his overlord, Emperor Henry VI. In January 1193, Richard's brother, John, was summoned to Paris, where he did homage to Philip for all of Richard's lands, and promised to marry Alys with Artois as her dowry. In return, the Vexin and the castle of Gisors would be given to Philip. With the help of Philip, John went to invade England and incite rebellion against Richard's justiciars. John failed and then had worse luck when it was discovered Richard was alive, which was unknown until this point. At the imperial court in Speyer, Richard was put on trial where he spoke very well for himself: Richard was to be set free after a deal was finalised in June 1193. However, whilst the discussions had been going on, Philip and John had created war in three different areas of the Angevin Empire. Firstly, in England, John had attempted to take over, asserting that Richard would never return. The justiciars pushed him and his forces back to the castles of Tickhill and Windsor, which were besieged. A deal was made that allowed John to keep Tickhill and Nottingham, but return his other possessions. Secondly, in Aquitaine, Ademar of Angoul√™me claimed that he held his county directly as a fief of Philip's, not as a vassal of the Duke of Aquitaine. He raided Poitou but was stopped by the local officials, and captured. Thirdly, and finally, in Normandy, Philip had taken Gisors and Neaufles, and the lords of Aum√¢le, Eu, and other smaller lordships, as well as the counts of Meulan and Perche, had surrendered to Philip. Philip failed to take Rouen in April but gained other castles; Gillingham summarised, saying that \\"April and May 1193 were wonderfully good months for Philip\\". When Philip heard of Richard's deal with Emperor Henry, he decided to consolidate his gains by forcing Richard's regents to concede with a treaty at Mantes in July 1193. Firstly, John was handed back his estates in both England and France. Secondly, Count Ademar was to be released and no Aquitanian vassals were to be charged or penalised. Thirdly, Richard was to give four major castles to Philip and pay the cost of garrisoning them, along with other compensation. Richard failed to be reconciled with his brother, John, and so John went to Philip and created a new treaty in January 1194, surrendering all of Normandy east of the Seine except Rouen and Tours and the other castles of Touraine to Philip, Vend√¥me to Louis of Blois, and Moulins and Bonsmoulins to Count Geoffrey of Perche. The county of Angoul√™me was to be independent of the duchy of Aquitaine. The Angevin Empire was being completely split by John's actions. Philip continued to bargain with Emperor Henry, and the emperor cut a new deal with Richard after being offered large sums of money by Philip and John. Richard would surrender the kingdom of England to Henry, who would then give it back as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Richard had become a vassal of Henry. Richard was released, and whilst still in Germany he paid for the homage of the archbishops of Mainz and Cologne, the bishop of Li√®ge, the duke of Brabant, the duke of Limburg, the count of Holland, and other lesser lords. These allies were the beginning of a coalition against Philip. Although Philip had been granted many Norman territories, it was only nominally. In February, he captured √âvreux, Neubourg, Vaudreuil, and other towns. He also received the homage of two of Richard's vassals, Geoffrey de Rancon and Bernard of Brosse. Philip and his allies were now in control of all the ports of Flanders, Boulogne, and eastern Normandy. Richard finally returned to England and landed at Sandwich on 13 March 1194. =Richard after captivity= Richard was in a difficult position; Philip II had taken over large parts of his continental domains and had inherited Amiens and Artois. England was Richard's most secure possession; Hubert Walter, who had been to the crusade with Richard, was appointed his justiciar. Richard besieged the remaining castle that had declared allegiance to John and not capitulated: Nottingham Castle. He then met with William the Lion in April and rejected William the Lion's offer to purchase Northumbria, to which William possessed a claim. Later, he took over John's Lordship of Ireland and replaced his justiciar. The construction of Ch√¢teau Gaillard began under Richard's rule, but he died before it could be seen finished. Richard I had merely crossed the English Channel to claim back his territories that John Lackland betrayed Philip II by murdering the garrison of √âvreux and handing the town down to Richard I. \\"He had first betrayed his father, then his brother and now our King\\" said William the Breton. Sancho the Strong, the future King of Navarre, joined the conflict and attacked Aquitaine, capturing Angoul√®me and Tours. Richard himself was known to be a great military commander. The first part of this war was difficult for Richard who suffered several setbacks, as Philip II was, as described by John Gillingham, \\"a shrewd politician and a competent soldier.\\" But by October the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, left the Capetian side and joined Richard's. He was followed by Baldwin IV of Flanders, the future Latin Emperor, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II. In 1197, Henry VI died and was replaced by Otto IV, Richard I's own nephew. Renaud de Dammartin, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II. Baldwin IV was invading Artois and captured Saint-Omer while Richard I was campaigning in Berry and inflicted a severe defeat on Philip II at Gisors, close to Paris. A truce was accepted, and Richard I had almost recovered all Normandy and now held more territories in Aquitaine than he had before. Richard I had to deal with a revolt once again, but this time from Limousin. He was struck by a bolt in April 1199 at Ch√¢lus-Chabrol and died of a subsequent infection. His body was buried at Fontevraud like his father. Collapse of the Angevin Empire =John's accession to the throne= Following the news of King Richard I's death in 1199, John attempted to seize the Angevin treasury at Chinon in order to impose his control of the Angevin government. Angevin custom, however, gave John's nephew, Duke Arthur, son of Geoffrey of Brittany, a stronger claim on Richard's throne, and the nobles of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine declared in favour of Arthur on 18 April 1199. Philip II of France had taken √âvreux and the Norman Vexin, and a Breton army had seized Angers by this point. Le Mans refused to declare allegiance to John, so he ran to Normandy, where he was invested as duke in Rouen on 25 April. He returned to Le Mans with an army where he punished its citizens and then left for England. England had declared its support for John thanks to William Marshal and Archbishop Hubert Walter of Canterbury's support. He was crowned on 27 May in Westminster Abbey. Due to his mother's support, Aquitaine and Poitou supported John, and only Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany remained disputed. In May, Aimeri, Viscount of Thouars, who was chosen by John to be his seneschal in Anjou, attacked Tours in an attempt to capture Arthur of Brittany. Aimeri failed, and John was forced to return to the continent in order to secure his rule, through a truce with Philip II, after Philip had launched attacks on Normandy. Philip was forced into the truce due to John's support from fifteen French counts and support from counts in the Lower Rhine, such as with Count Baldwin of Flanders, who he met in August 1199 in Rouen, and Baldwin did John homage. From a position of strength, John was able to go on the offensive, and he won William des Roches, Arthur's candidate for the Angevin seneschal, to his cause following an incident with Philip. William des Roches also brought Duke Arthur and his mother, Constance, as prisoners to Le Mans on 22 September 1199, and the succession appeared to have been secured in favour of John. Despite the escape of Arthur and Constance with Aimeri of Thouars to Philip II, and many of Richard's previous allies in France, including the counts of Flanders, Blois, and Perche, leaving for the Holy Land, John was able to make peace with Philip that secured his accession to his brother's throne. John met with Philip and signed the Treaty of Le Goulet in May 1200, where Philip accepted John's succession to the Angevin Empire, and Arthur became his vassal, but John was forced to break his German alliances, accept Philip's gains in Normandy, and cede lands in Auvergne and Berry. John was also to accept Philip as his suzerain overlord and pay Philip 20,000 marks. As W. L. Warren notes, this Treaty began the practical dominance of the French king over France, and the ruler of the Angevin Empire was no longer the dominating noble in France. In June 1200, John visited Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, taking hostages from those he distrusted, and visiting Aquitaine, where he received homage from his mother's vassals, returning to Poitiers in August. =Lusignan rebellion and the Anglo-French war= Duke Arthur I of Brittany paying homage to King Philip II of France, from the Grandes Chroniques de France Following the annulment of John's first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, John married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Count Aymer of Angoul√™me, on 24 August 1200. Angoul√™me had considerable strategic significance, and the marriage made \\"very good political sense\\", according to Warren. However, Isabella had been betrothed to Hugh of Lusignan, and John's treatment of Hugh following the marriage, including the seizure of La Marche, led Hugh to appeal to Philip II. Philip summoned John to his court, and John's refusal resulted in the confiscation of John's continental possessions excluding Normandy in April 1202 and Philip accepting Arthur's homage for the lands in July. Philip went on to invade Normandy as far as Arques in May, taking a number of castles. John, following a message from his mother, Eleanor, rushed from Le Mans to Mirebeau, attacking the town on 1 August 1202, with William des Roches. William promised to direct the attack on condition he was consulted on the fate of Arthur, and successfully captured the town along with over 200 knights, including three Lusignans. John also captured Arthur, but antagonised William, failing to consult him on the future of Arthur, and causing him to leave John along with Aimeri of Thouars and siege Angers. Under the control of Hubert de Burgh in Falaise, Arthur disappeared and John was seen as responsible for his murder. The Angevin Empire was under attack in all areas, with the following year, 1203, being described as that \\"of shame\\" by Warren. In December 1203, John left Normandy never to return, and on 24 June 1204, Normandy capitulated with the surrender of Rouen. Tours, Chinon, and Loches had fallen by 1205. On the night of 31 March 1204, John's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, died, causing a rush of \\"most of Poitou...to do homage to the king of France\\". King Alfonso of Castile invaded Gascony, using the claim of his wife, John's sister Eleanor. When John to the continent in June 1206, only the resistance led by H√©lie de Malemort, Archbishop of Bordeaux had prevented Alfonso's success. By the end of John's expedition on 26 October 1206, most of Aquitaine was secure. A truce was made between John and Philip to last for two years. The Angevin Empire had been reduced to England, Gascony, Ireland, and parts of Poitou, and John would not return to his continental possessions for eight years. =Return to France= La Bataille de Bouvines, by Horace Vernet. A 19th-century depiction of Philip II of France at the Battle of Bouvines. By the end of 1212, Philip II was preparing an invasion of England. Philip aimed to crown his son, Louis, king of England, and at a council at Soissons in April 1213, he drafted a possible relationship between the future France and England. On 30 May, William Longesp√©e, Earl of Salisbury, succeeding in crushing the French invasion fleet in the Battle of Damme and preventing French invasion. In February 1214, John landed in La Rochelle after creating alliances headed by the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto. The aim was for the Earl of Salisbury and John's German allies to attack Philip from the north, whilst John attacked from the south. By June 1214, John had the support of the houses of Lusignan, Maul√©on, and Thouars, but when John advanced into Anjou, capturing Angers on 17 June, the desertion of his Poitevin allies forced a retreat back to La Rochelle. On 27 July, John's German allies lost the Battle of Bouvines, with many prisoners taken, including the Earl of Salisbury. On 18 September, John and Philip agreed to a truce that would last until Easter 1220. In October 1214, John returned to England. =Capetian invasion of England= Magna Carta, signed at Runnymede on 15 June 1215 Following the agreement at Runnymede in June 1215, rebel English barons felt that John would not observe the terms of Magna Carta, and offered the English crown to Philip's son, Louis. Louis accepted, landing in Kent on 21 May 1216, with 1,200 knights. Louis seized Rochester, London, and Winchester, whilst John was deserted by several nobles, including the Earl of Salisbury. In August, only Dover, Lincoln, and Windsor remained loyal to John in the east, and Alexander II of Scotland travelled to Canterbury to pay homage to Louis. In September 1216, John began his attack, marching from the Cotswolds, feigning an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle, and attacking eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. In King's Lynn, John contracted dysentery. On 18 October 1216, John died. Louis was defeated twice following John's death in 1217, in Lincoln in May, and at Sandwich in August, resulting in his withdrawal from the claim on the throne and England with the Treaty of Lambeth in September. Cultural influence The hypothetical continuation and expansion of the Angevin Empire over several centuries has been the subject of several tales of alternate history. Historically, both English and French historians had viewed the juxtaposition of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an aberration and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an encumbrance, while French historians considered the union to be an English empire. The ruling class of the Angevin Empire was French-speaking. The 12th century is also the century of Gothic architecture, first known as , from the work of the Abbot Suger at Saint Denis in 1140. The Early English Period began around 1180 or 1190, in the times of the Angevin Empire, but this religious architecture was totally independent of the Angevin Empire, it was just born at the same moment and spread at those times in England. One of the strongest influences on architecture directly associated with the Plantagenets is about kitchens. Richard I's personal arms of three golden lions passant guardantIn medieval heraldry, these lions passant guardant are known as leopards ‚Äì on a red field appear in most subsequent English royal heraldry, and in variations on the flags of both Normandy and Aquitaine. From a political point of view, continental issues were given more attention from the monarchs of England than the British ones already under the Normans. Under Angevin lordship things became even more clear as the balance of power was dramatically set in France and the Angevin kings often spent more time in France than England. With the loss of Normandy and Anjou, the fiefdom was cut in two and then the descendants of the Plantagenets can be regarded as English kings accounting Gascony in their domain. This is accordant with the newfound Lordship of Aquitaine being conferred upon the Black Prince of Wales, passing thence to the House of Lancaster, which had pretensions to the Crown of Castile, much as Edward III had to France. It was this assertion of power from England onto France and from Aquitaine onto Castile which marked the difference from earlier in the Angevin period.

History =Sterlite Industries= Vedanta (then called Sterlite industries) had humble beginnings in the 1980s, as the founder D.P.Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries (India) Limited in Mumbai and began to buy mining concessions in different states of India. He was soon joined by his two sons, Navin Agarwal and Sunil Agarwal, both of who currently run the company. In 1992, they established Volcan investments in Nassau (Bahamas) as the main holding company for their mines. D.P.Agarwal had a small aluminium conductor business in Patna. His son Anil Agarwal had come to Mumbai to expand their business. In the 1990s, as the Indian government began to sell off sick (non- performing) companies, Sterlite began to bid for them. They were able to bid successfully for BALCO and Hindustan Zinc Limited, both bankrupt companies that had been closed down for 4 years. Meanwhile, in January 1993, D. P. Agarwal founded Twinstar Holdings Limited in Mauritius, which was mostly owned by Volcan investments. On 26 May 2002, the Enforcement Directorate filed a show cause notice with Sterlite, relating to the six-year period between 1993 and 1999 when Twinstar acquired the shares of Sterlite and various investment companies ‚Äì such as Dwarka Prasad Anil Kumar Investments Private Limited, Pravin Navin Investment & Trading Private Limited and Sterlite Copper Rolling Mills Private Limited ‚Äì which, in turn, had made substantial investments in Sterlite and another group company, Madras Aluminium Company Limited (MALCO) after obtaining permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On 29 April 1999, many of these investment companies were liquidated and all the shares of Sterlite came back to Twinstar's possession. Twinstar became the 100% owner of shares in these investment companies and received government approvals from the RBI as well as the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). On 8 December 1999, officials of the Income Tax department raided the offices of Sterlite located at Dhanraj Mahal, Apollo Bunder and Tulsiani Chambers, Mumbai, and seized many documents. The IT department then decided to engage the services of ED officials as it appeared that there could have been a violation of the country's foreign exchange laws. After analyzing these documents, the ED inferred that Twinstar was incorporated with the sole intention of acquiring an interest in Sterlite. The Directorate alleged that the Agarwals, before liquidating the shares of the investment companies mentioned, had written off loans worth 230 million and made an agreement to gift their overseas corporate body, Twinstar, a sum of Rs 338 million including shares of Sterlite worth Rs 72 million. Between 1993 and 1999, Sterlite and its investment companies allegedly brought in Rs 2.08 billion to India through Twinstar to subscribe to the shares of Sterlite and make investments in the company. =Sesa Goa ‚Äì Scambi (1954‚Äì1963)= The company today known as Sesa Goa was founded in 1954, as Scambi Economici SA Goa.http://profit.ndtv.com/Corporate/Company-History/100295/Sesa-Goa- Ltd-?microslug=livebudget2012 Since then, it gradually grew to become a large low-cost producer of iron ore. During 1991‚Äì1995, it diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke. Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limited was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963. =Sesa Goa (1963‚Äì2007)= Sesa Goa Limited was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limited with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called 'Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd'. The company went public in 1981 with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.http://www.edelweiss.in/market/Information.aspx?co_code=502&tb;=CH In the 1990s, Sesa Goa began further expansion, aided by an influx of foreign investment during the economic liberalization of India enforced by the World Bank and IMF. In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India's first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant was located at Amona, Goa and had an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties‚Äîin January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring a transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa. In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip. During this time, the company also started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a football academy called SESA F.A. During the end of the 90s, the company also began to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power as a by-product. In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern. =Take over by Vedanta (2007)= In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth , making it the largest M&A; deal in the industry so far. In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group's mining and maritime businesses for in an all- cash deal. This was the second largest acquisition in India's iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo's 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million. The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment. In 2007, it became a majority-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui & Co., Ltd. In June 2009, Sesa Goa Limited acquired VS Dempo & Co. Private Limited (now Sesa Resources Limited) along with its fully owned subsidiary Dempo Mining Corporation (now Vedanta Limited) and 50% equity in Goa Maritime Private Limited. In 2010, Vedanta acquired the zinc assets of British miner Anglo American plc. In 2011 Vedanta Resources bought 58.5% controlling stake in Cairn India, India's largest private sector oil & gas company. In 2015, Sterlite Industries and Sesa Goa announced their merger and finally merged into a single entity in August 2015. In 2015, Sesa Sterlite changed its name to Vedanta Limited. On 11 April 2017, Cairn India merged with Vedanta Limited to consolidate its position as one of the largest diversified natural resources companies in the world. In 2018 Vedanta Limited acquired control of Electrosteels Steels Limited. Electrosteel Steels had been constructing an integrated steel plant at Siyaljori in Jharkhand. In May 2020, it is declared that company is going to delist from Indian bourses as per the comment by Mr. Anil Agarwal.

The protests continued for three months and began to draw the attention of the media as well as local political parties who began to instigate as well as mobilise locals. Most of the protests were related to what locals perceived to be pollution from the Sterlite factory. The managers of Sterlite countered that there were another four similar plants adjacent to them, and that they were complying with all government regulations. There was little equipment, either with the plant or with the government to take actual measurements of the air in the vicinity. Sterlite further countered that contrary to the rumours that were being circulated, they did not pump any water from the plant into the sea which lay more than 10 kilometers away. In April 2018, the Government of Tamil Nadu placed an order to close down the factory. This order was temporarily cancelled by the district collector.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tuticorin-anti-sterlite- protest-power-cut-for-vedanta-owned-sterlite-in-tuticorin-10-latest- facts-1857089http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/sterlite-s- pollution-problem-113041801267_1.html In May 2018, amidst ongoing protests by thousands of people, matters turned rough one day and the police opened fire on demonstrators.http://www.dinamalar.com/news_detail.asp?id=2027846https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-india-44234715 The firing killed 13 people and protesters turned violent, burning vehicles and structures.

History Three years after being founded in 1990, the band entered a more professional phase, in a line-up with founder Cristiano Fusco on guitar, Wagner \\"Castor\\" on bass, Amilcar Christofaro on drums, and Vitor Rodrigues as frontman and singer. They started touring in and around S√£o Paulo and soon recorded a demo, released in 1993, A Soul in Hell. Their first CD was Shivering (1995); their break-through came with Asylum of Shadows (1999). Their 2001 album, The Unholy Spell, came right after the band's first tour in Germany. In 2002, Cristiano Fusco left the band, and the band hired Mauricio Nogueira (a seasoned studio musician who played for Krisiun as well as other local bands like In Hell and Zoltar), and went on their first Brazilian tour. Pandemonium produced by Marcello Pompeu and Heros Trench (Korzus) was released in 2003. The CD was supported by a TV video clip for \\"Pandemonium\\" and \\"Horror and Torture.\\" Again, the band played all over Brazil. Then, in 2006 Torture Squad embarked on a European tour, headlining in 16 towns in Germany and 4 in Austria. Afterward they played in more cities in Brazil until they participated in the Brazilian pre-selection for the famed Wacken Open Air festival. They eventually won the final in S√£o Paulo, and they represented Brazil at Wacken Battle of the Bands 2007, which they won. This victory won them a contract with Armageddon Records (Germany); Mauricio Nogueira also won the \\"best guitar player\\" award, which earned him a brand new Dean guitar and a Marshall pre-amp. Hellbound, was released in May 2008 by Armageddon, not long after Mauricio Nogueira left the band for personal reasons and Augusto Lopes (Eternal Malediction) was announced as the new guitarist. In 2008, Torture Squad embarked on a 60-date European tour, which will include a show at Wacken Open Air. The year of 2009 started pretty well for Torture Squad. After the release of Hellbound and its excellent repercussion in Brazil, Europe and the United States, it was followed by a European tour with two of the world's major thrash metal bands, Overkill and Exodus. The tour began in mid February in London, where the Brazilian group performed for the first time, and included 12 more shows in countries like Spain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Their most recent studio album ‚ÄúAEquilibrium‚Äù was released in Europe in August 2010 by Wacken Records / H'art / Zebralution / SAOL. They recorded a new version for the title track of their third album ‚ÄúThe Unholy Spell‚Äù which is included as bonus track with the title of ‚ÄúThe Unholy Spell 2010‚Äù. The album was recorded in S√£o Paulo/Brazil, at Norcal Studios with producers Brendan Duffey and Adriano Daga. In January 2011, guitarist Augusto Lopes leaves the band and is replaced by Andr√© Evaristo. Even with the line up changing, the band does not stop, remaining on the road until July of the same year. One month later, the band cross the ocean one more time, for the European part of the √Üquilibrium Tour 2011, with more than 40 concerts in 12 countries until the end of October, including the third concert on the German festival Wacken Open Air, turning Torture Squad into the only Brazilian band to play three times in the festival. In March 2012, the frontman Vitor Rodrigues leaves the band. Soon after that, the band turned out to be a power trio with Andr√© Evaristo taking the lead vocals along the guitar. With this line up they played with important concerts and festivals in South America, which is held in Quito city, the capital city of Ecuador, for an approximate audience of 25,000 people. In 2013, the band celebrates the 20th anniversary of the release of the demo-tape A Soul in Hell, their first studio record, which was celebrated in the Twenty Years Torturing People Tour 1993‚Äì2013, that started in May in Europe, alongside Artillery, Gama Bomb and Tantara, with 18 concerts in 20 days. From April to August, 2013, the band chooses, again, Norcal Studios to record their seventh studio album, Esquadr√£o de Tortura (Torture Squad in Portuguese), and reprising the association with Brendan Duffey and Adriano Daga as producers. Esquadr√£o de Torture is the first work recorded by the band as a trio and the first lyrical concept album, narrating, in chronological order, the period in which Brazil was governed by a military regime (from 1964 to 1985), being also the first album to have a title in Portuguese. The official release date was November 15, the Brazilian Republic Day. In July and August 2014, the band do their second South American tour with thirteen shows in four countries; Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Paraguay. Finishing the year in their hometown S√£o Paulo / SP on December, 20, recording its show to be released on DVD and CD entitled ‚ÄúCoup d¬¥√âtat Live‚Äù, set to be launched in the middle of 2015. In September 2015, vocalist / guitarist Andr√© Evaristo leaves Torture Squad to pursue other personal projects, therefore, the band back to its traditional line-up as a quartet bringing Mayara ‚ÄúUndead‚Äù Puertas on vocals and Rene Simionato on guitars, continuing the tour of ‚ÄúCoup D¬¥√âtat Live‚Äù. Already with their new line up, the band goes to studio to record the EP ‚ÄúReturn of Evil‚Äù, with four songs: the new ‚ÄúReturn of Evil‚Äù, ‚ÄúSwallow Your Reality‚Äù and ‚ÄúIron Squad‚Äù, and the new version of ‚ÄúDreadful Lies‚Äù, originally released in the 1998 first album Shivering. The EP will also have a multimedia track with the video clip of ‚ÄúReturn of the Evil‚Äù and a mini documentary of the EP recording sessions, and the videos of ‚ÄúDreadful Lies‚Äù and ‚ÄúIron Squad‚Äù exclusively made for the EP, which will be released in March 2016. In September 2016, the band made a historic tour in Brazil playing 28 gigs in 32 days throughout the country from north to south. Soon after the Brazilian tour, the band goes to a European tour doing 19 gigs passing by seven countries. The Return of Evil tour finishes in February 2017, doing 13 shows during 16 days in the country side of S√£o Paulo and Paran√°. In April 2017, the band starts the recordings of their eighth album entitled Far Beyond Existence released on July 13 (World Rock Day). In August 2017, they started the Far Beyond Existence Tour as headliner, alongside Brazilian bands Hatefulmurder, Warcursed and Reckoning Hour, performing 26 shows in 30 days all over Brazil. In November, after seven years, the band returns to Buenos Aires / Argentina for a mini tour of four dates. Starting the year 2018, they returns to the road with the band. The \\"Zumbis Squad Tour\\" undertakes eight shows in the country side of S√£o Paulo in February. In March, the band makes another South American tour, playing in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile.

It is usually written by a technical writer, although user guides are written by programmers, product or project managers, or other technical staff, particularly in smaller companies.Gary Blake and Robert W. Bly, The Elements of Technical Writing, pg. 143. New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. User guides are most commonly associated with electronic goods, computer hardware and software, although they can be written for any product. Most user guides contain both a written guide and associated images. In the case of computer applications, it is usual to include screenshots of the human-machine interface(s), and hardware manuals often include clear, simplified diagrams. The language used is matched to the intended audience, with jargon kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly. Contents of a user manual The sections of a user manual often include: *A cover page *A title page and copyright page *A preface, containing details of related documents and information on how to navigate the user guide *A contents page *A Purpose section. This should be an overview rather than detail the objective of the document *An Audience section to explicitly state who is not as well as who is required to read, including optionals *A Scope section is crucial as it also serves as a disclaimer, stating what is out-of-scope as well as what is covered *A guide on how to use at least the main function of the system *A troubleshooting section detailing possible errors or problems that may occur, along with how to fix them *A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) *Where to find further help, and contact details *A glossary and, for larger documents, an index  History  The user guide engraved into a model of the Antikythera Mechanism. User guides have been found with ancient devices. One example is the Antikythera Mechanism, a 2,000 year old Greek analogue computer that was found off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in the year 1900. On the cover of this device are passages of text which describe the features and operation of the mechanism. As the software industry was developing, the question of how to best document software programs was undecided. This was a unique problem for software developers, since users often became frustrated with current help documents. Some considerations for writing a user guide that developed at this time include: * the use of plain language * length and reading difficulty * the role of printed user guides for digital programs * user-centered design Computer software manuals and guides User manuals and user guides for most non-trivial software applications are book-like documents with contents similar to the above list. They may be distributed either in print or electronically. Some documents have a more fluid structure with many internal links. The Google Earth User Guide is an example of this format. The term guide is often applied to a document that addresses a specific aspect of a software product. Some usages are Installation Guide, Getting Started Guide, and various How to guides. An example is the Picasa Getting Started Guide. In some business software applications, where groups of users have access to only a sub-set of the application's full functionality, a user guide may be prepared for each group. An example of this approach is the Autodesk Topobase 2010 Help document, which contains separate Administrator Guides, User Guides, and a Developer's Guide.

Its main settlement is the village of Broad Blunsdon, with Lower Blunsdon nearby; the hamlet of Broadbush is now contiguous with Broad Blunsdon. Blunsdon is the eastern half of the former Blunsdon St Andrew civil parish. In April 2017 the parish was divided, with the western half becoming St Andrews parish. History Blunsdon dates from Roman times: it was discovered that a Roman travellers‚Äô resting place existed on the site of the present-day Cold Harbour public house. The main A419 road follow the course of a Roman road known as Ermin Street that linked the historic Roman towns of Gloucester (Glevum) and Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum), via Cirencester (Corinium). In 1086 it appears in the Domesday Book as Bluntesdone. Sport Blunsdon's Abbey Stadium is the home of Swindon Greyhounds, broadcast world-wide three times per week and a stalwart of off course betting shops in the U.K. all the year round, plus speedway team the Swindon Robins. The Robins compete in the Elite League, with matches regularly televised live on Sky Sports. However, this was briefly under threat in 2006 due to plans by developers to demolish the stadium and replace it with houses with a proposal to build a smaller greyhound racing stadium elsewhere, but these were modified to a propose a new stadium on the existing site for both sports. These plans were at first recommended for refusal by the Council Officers for various reasons, the developers agreed to take the plans away for adjustment and in May 2008 planning inspectors approved the new plans, which included 450 houses and office space. The village has a football team, Blunsdon FC, which has youth development squads as well as a senior men's side playing in the Wiltshire League.  Local government  Blunsdon parish covers Broad Blunsdon and the area west of the A419. In the southeast, the boundary with St Andrews leaves the A419 and follows the A4311 Cricklade Road, so that the Groundwell industrial estate is in Blunsdon parish. Until April 2017, the whole area was the civil parish of Blunsdon St Andrew. The parish lies within the Borough of Swindon. Village shop After the last privately owned shop in the village closed in 2002, a village public meeting convened and agreed to open a new community shop, which was opened in 2003. Located in the car park of the village hall, the shop was originally based inside a secondhand site office cabin, but in 2009 this was replaced by a brand new structure. Run mainly by volunteers, in 2010 the shop won third place for 'Best Village Shop' at the Wiltshire Life Magazine Awards Transport The Swindon and Cricklade Railway has rebuilt Blunsdon railway station, just outside the parish boundary. =A419 bypass= A bypass was built between the autumn of 2006 and spring 2009.

History In the mid-1970s the British Government decided to update the nationality code, which had been significantly amended since the British Nationality Act 1948 came into force on 1 January 1949. In 1977, a Green Paper was produced by the Labour government outlining options for reform of the nationality code. This was followed in 1980 by a White Paper by the Conservative government that closely followed the Labour proposals. William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was the chief author. The British Nationality Act 1981 received Royal Assent on 30 October 1981 and came into force on 1 January 1983. Both major parties were in agreement on the new law. Subsequently, the British Nationality Act has been significantly amended, including: * British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 * Hong Kong Act 1985 and Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 * British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990, which introduced the British Nationality Selection Scheme * Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996 * British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 * Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 * British Overseas Territories Act 2002 * Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 * Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 * Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 Objectives of the Act =Reclassification of United Kingdom and Colonies citizenship= The Act reclassified Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) into three categories: * British citizenship * British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC); and * British Overseas citizenship. Since 1962, with the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, not all CUKCs had the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom. The Act sought to restore once again the link between citizenship and right of abode by providing that British citizenship‚Äîheld by those with a close connection with either the United Kingdom or with the Crown Dependencies (that is to say, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), or both‚Äîwould automatically carry a right of abode in the UK. The other categories of British nationality would not hold such status based on nationality, although in some cases would do so under the immigration laws. Whilst in opposition in 1977, the Conservative Party asked Edward Gardner to chair a study group to provide advice on changes to the nationality laws. The resultant Green paper, \\"Who Do We Think We Are?\\", was published in 1980 and its threefold definition of nationality formed the basis for the Government's legislation. Originally the paper proposed just two categories of British nationality, British citizenship and British Overseas citizenship. However, the British Dependent Territory governments successfully lobbied for an additional category of nationality, which would cater for those with close connections to any of the British territories. =Modification of jus soli= The Act also modified the application of jus soli in British nationality. Prior to the Act coming into force, any person born in the United Kingdom or a colony (with limited exceptions such as children of diplomats and enemy aliens) was entitled to CUKC status. After the Act came into force, it was necessary for at least one parent of a United Kingdom-born child to be a British citizen, a British Dependent Territories citizen or \\"settled\\" in the United Kingdom or a colony (a permanent resident). Even following the coming into force of the Act, the vast majority of children born in the United Kingdom or colonies still acquire British nationality at birth. Special provisions are made for non-British UK born children to acquire British citizenship in certain circumstances. =Relation to Immigration Act 1971= Under section 11(1) of the Act, a CUKC must have had the right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971, as it existed on 31 December 1982, to become a British citizen on 1 January 1983 automatically under the standard CUKC transition at commencement route of the Act. Section 39 of the Act then went on to modify the right of abode section of the 1971 measure, eliminating confusing wording as to whether right of abode could be obtained through a grandparent who was a CUKC from outside the UK. =Other changes= The Act made a variety of other changes to the law: * Mothers as well as fathers were allowed to pass on British citizenship to their children. * The term Commonwealth citizen was used to replace British subject. Under the Act, the term British subject was restricted to certain persons holding British nationality through connections with British India or the Republic of Ireland before 1949. * Right of Abode could no longer be acquired by non-British citizens. A limited number of Commonwealth citizens holding Right of Abode were allowed to retain it. * The rights of Commonwealth and Irish citizens to become British citizens by registration were removed and instead they were to be expected to apply for naturalisation if they wanted to acquire British citizenship. Irish citizens, however, who were, or claim British subject nationality retain their right to acquire British citizenship nationality through registration.Laurie Fransman, British Nationality Law (1997) p 238. * Special provision was made for persons from Gibraltar to acquire British citizenship. * Women married to British men could no longer acquire British citizenship purely by marriage. * British Crown Colonies were renamed British Dependent Territories (subsequently amended to British Overseas Territories) * The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, references to which had been construed as references to colonies under the British Nationality Act 1948,British Nationality Act 1948: \\"References in this Act to colonies shall be construed as including references to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man\\" were now to be construed as being part of the United Kingdom for nationality purposes.British Nationality Act 1981, section 50(1): \\"In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires‚Äî\\" ... \\"‚Äúthe United Kingdom‚Äù means Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Islands, taken together\\" In some cases, transitional arrangements were made that preserved certain aspects of the old legislation. Most of these expired on 31 December 1987, five years after the Act came into force. Criticisms Critics argued that one of the main political motivations behind the new law was to deny most Hong Kong-born ethnic Chinese the right of residency in the United Kingdom in the time preceding the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and later the handover of Hong Kong (then the largest British colony by population), to the People's Republic of China in 1997. However, persons from Hong Kong had lost the automatic right to live in the United Kingdom in 1962, and the Act did not change this. Other criticisms were levelled at the time at the removal of the automatic right to citizenship by birth in the United Kingdom. However, because UK-born children of permanent residents are automatically British, the number of non-British children born in the United Kingdom is relatively small. Special provisions made in the Act (for those who do not have another nationality and for those who lived a long time in the United Kingdom) means there is little pressure for any change to the current law. Similar legislation was later enacted in Australia (1986), the Republic of Ireland (2004) and New Zealand (2005). After the Act After the Falklands war, full British citizenship was granted to the Falkland Islanders by the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983.

Underlying salt domes forced the seafloor upward in various areas of the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the formation of rises and banks. Conditions of the Gulf of Mexico were conducive to reef-building, which started roughly ten to fifteen thousand years ago. Two reefs, East Flower Garden Bank (EFGB) and West Flower Garden Bank (WFGB), made up Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) when it was initially created in 1992. In 1996, Stetson Bank was added to the sanctuary. The three banks are not contiguous. The sanctuary contains many aquatic species. Almost three hundred species of fish and over twenty species of coral are found in the sanctuary along with a wide variety of crustaceans, sponges, and plants. FGBNMS provides habitat for many protected and/or threatened species including marine mammals, sharks, rays, and sea turtles. Many fish species important to recreational and commercial fisheries inhabit the banks.  History  The first recorded discovery of the areas comprising FGBNMS did not occur until 1936, when EFGB, WFGB, and Stetson Bank were included in a hydrographic survey of the Gulf of Mexico conducted by the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey. The survey provided valuable information about the geological and topographical characteristics of the banks. These initial surveys, along with additional surveys conducted in the 1950s, led researchers to conclude that the banks originated when salt domes forced overlaying sediments upward to form underwater mountains. Dr. Thomas Pulley, Director Emeritus of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, led a team of professional and volunteer amateur explorers to investigate EFGB and WFGB in the early 1960s. The presence of coral reefs off the Texas coast was still being debated at that time. Some researchers predicted the area would be too cold, or too turbid to support any extensive coral reef development. These scuba diving explorations, however, revealed that EFGB and WFGB did indeed support extensive, pristine coral reef systems. In the late 1960s, Robert Alderdice and James Covington established the Flower Gardens Ocean Research center (FGORC), heralding a period of intense interdisciplinary research which continues to this day. Results of this on-going research prompted U.S. government agencies to begin discussing the need to protect the banks from increasing human activities, including oil and gas extraction, anchoring on the reefs, and harvesting fish, corals and other invertebrates. With passage of the Marine Research and Sanctuaries Act in 1972, researchers began discussing the Flower Garden Banks as a candidate for designation as a National Marine Sanctuary. During the 1980s, recreational divers were also discovering the Flower Garden Banks. The Houston Underwater Club led a movement to have the banks officially designated as sanctuaries by submitting a formal letter of nomination in 1979. Due to a number of issues, eleven years passed before the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary was officially established. President George H. W. Bush authorized Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary as the 10th National Marine Sanctuary on January 17, 1992. Stetson Bank was added to the sanctuary in 1996. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary administrative offices and laboratories are located in a renovated historic building, a part of the former Fort Crockett, in Galveston, Texas. Research Vessel MANTA is also located in Galveston, and provides a working platform for researchers. A system of mooring buoys, which reduces resource impacts from anchoring, is maintained by FGBNMS staff.

It is located along the Paddle River and at the intersection of Highway 33 (Grizzly Trail) and Highway 18, approximately northwest of the City of Edmonton. It is also located along the route of the Express Trail, used by the North West Company. Originally a First Nations trail that was widened by George Simpson and John Rowand to save the North West Company over $5,000. The town was named after the Scottish town Barrhead, the birthplace of one of the children of the area's early settlers, James McGuire. Barrhead's official bird is the great blue heron.  History  During the late 19th century and the early 20th century, Barrhead played an important role in the settlement of northwest Alberta. Highway 33, known as the Grizzly Trail, follows the original Klondike Trail, which was the shortest route to the Yukon during the Gold Rush years. Once established, this route was key to the settlement of the Peace River region. The old Barrhead town site, 3 km north of the present Town Centre, was a frequent stop over for the few Klondikers and others who needed supplies for the rigorous journey north. Originally established in 1906, Barrhead's position as a major trade centre on the historic Klondike Trail gave it a significant role in the settlement of north-western Alberta. It was a vital link in the trade route from Fort Edmonton to the Yukon. James McGuire, the child of one of the first settlers in the area, named Barrhead after his hometown in Scotland. Today, the community's rich history can be revisited through a collection of artifacts at the Barrhead and District Museum. The museum also houses a large display of African taxidermy, as well as the Barrhead Visitor Information Centre, which is open from May to September. The great blue heron is another prominent figure in local lore, is often spotted along the shores of the Paddle River and local lakes, and is the town's official animal. A statue of the bird is situated next to the Community Gazebo that marks the town centre and miniatures of the bird adorn the street posts. The area was a quiet land of rolling hills well covered with stands of poplar, birch, pine and spruce trees on the higher ground with the low areas filled with willow and tamarack. The area has always been sparsely populated, with Cree natives passing through the region for the last 5000 years mainly settling around the different lakes in the region (such as Shoal Lake). In 1810 a First Nations trail was explored by David Thompson to connect the North Saskatchewan with Athabasca Pass, creating the first Canadian Transcontinental connection. In 1811 the first letter ever delivered from British Columbia to Montreal passed through this trail and its importance as a communication and trade route began to grow. In 1824, at the request of Gov. George Simpson the trail was widened from Fort Assiniboine to Fort Edmonton passing one mile (1.6 km) east of the present town, to accommodate the increased traffic along to route (as many as 75 horses or more a day). Some of the larger pack trains had over a hundred head of horses. The Cree natives and trappers moved across the area as they went about their business. As the First Nations peoples trapped a greater number of beavers and broke a number of dams the Klondike trial became flooded and partially abandoned until 1898. During the gold rush some Klondikers attempted to use the trail, although most preferred the drier route that was established heading up to Athabasca Landing. The pack-trail was widened to allow teams of horses and wagons, loaded high with provisions, to carry gold seekers north. Homesteaders soon followed. Surveys of the land took place in 1906 and 1907 and the pioneers applied for quarters (160 acres) of land. Trading posts were busy on both the Pembina and Athabasca rivers. A small store in the log home of Percy and Mary Johnstone (2 miles north and east of town) was in operation. Andy Tuttle lived to the south and helped many settlers as they arrived. A post office named Paddle River was opened on Ted Speck's farm, one mile (1.6 km) southeast of town on the south side of the river in 1907. A store in Josh Cason's house, south and west of town, was operating in 1908 and a lean-to on the side provided a room for a school. Hugh Critchlow had taken land a mile north of Specks', along the Klondike Trail in 1907. Soon the Speck brothers (Ted and Fred) had built a bridge across the river and a sawmill was in operation on the north side. Cason and Critchlow partnered to build a store at Critchlow's in 1910 and the post office was moved there. A hall had been built just across the trail where school was held from 1909 to 1911. A blacksmith shop and a merry-go-round type swing completed the busy centre where nearly a hundred people attended the picnic in 1909. Rev. Seymour Dallas applied for a ten-acre cemetery plot (which is currently East Lawn Community Cemetery) and in 1913 the Anglican Church was built there. The church was subsequently moved to town in 1928 and then moved to Thunder Lake in 1967. Main Street, Barrhead The Paddle River Co-operative Society was formed in 1912 and opened a store in the old Johnstone building northeast of Barrhead in 1913. They immediately began construction on a new two-story building that would have room for community gatherings upstairs. Application was made for a post office, which required that they choose a name. The McGuire family suggested the name of their home town in Scotland and soon the Barrhead, Alberta, post office opened in the store on January 1, 1914. The Finch family built a stopping house which still stands nearby. The North-West Mounted Police built a barracks and the hall was moved over from the southern location (2.5 miles). A blacksmith shop and a garage were built on the other corner of the intersection and various families bought lots and built homes. The bus service to Edmonton was started in 1926 and the Toronto Dominion/TD Canada Trust bank was opened in the stopping house. The children went to school at Glenreagh, two miles (3 km) west. The community applied to have the railway brought here from Busby and landowners hoped to sell right-of-way. In 1907, Albert Shelton and family homesteaded the quarter that Barrhead's main street is on. He built a house, barn, dug a well and did some fencing, mostly in the northeast corner of the quarter, the highest area of land. The Sheltons moved away in 1912 leaving the quarter vacant and by 1927 the land was cheap so the Northern Alberta Railways agreed to bring the Pembina Valley branch line to this quarter. The Barrhead people then scrambled to move their homes, the garage and the store to this new location, where four elevators were already being built. The pattern of the streets and lots were carefully laid in relation to the railway tracks and buildings went up in rapid succession. The pattern chosen for the lots is still used today. In no time at all, businesses were in operation; from grocery and hardware stores, a drug store, restaurant, hotel, real estate office, butcher shop, livery barn, etc. to another, which was the United Church. Ted Hooper supplied electric lights. The incorporation of the village took place in November 1927. A seven- or eight- bed hospital opened that fall on the corner of 49A Street and Railroad Avenue. A new hospital was built across the main road (Highway 33) in 1934. The school was built and opened in 1928; a two-room building that needed another building for the High School by 1929. Around this time, heavy immigration started to occur from Germany. The town newspaper, the Barrhead News was printing in 1927 and soon was called the Barrhead Leader, the present day newspaper. In 1936, the curling rink was established plus William Johnson became the village constable. The movie theatre opened in 1939. In 1946, the village borrowed money to install water and sewer and that year on November 26 Barrhead became a town. Since then, the town has continued to grow and become continually more prosperous.  Geography  Aurora Borealis overhead Thunder Lake Provincial Park Example of the countryside around Barrhead The area contains dense stands of spruce, birch, pine and poplar. It also has some of the most fertile farmland in the province and is located between two major rivers, the Athabasca River and Pembina River. The Paddle River, a tributary of the Pembina River, flows directly through the town Barrhead. If you go south and east of town there are low flatlands and river-lands, and to the west of town there is the area's main recreational area, Thunder Lake Provincial Park, approximately west of the town. Thunder Lake is very popular for boating, fishing and camping and is home to many residents from other areas of the province during the summer months. The northern parts of the Barrhead region contain thick stands of spruce, pine and tamarack. Throughout the county of Barrhead there are also numerous lakes besides just Thunder Lake Provincial Park that are great for camping and fishing. There is also a local ski hill with good elevation on the Athabasca River valley. Wildlife in the Barrhead area include deer, moose, coyote, black bear, grizzly bear, mountain lion, wolves and the county emblem the great blue heron. = Climate = The town has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb, USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 3a) with warm summers and cold winters. There are four distinct seasons. Temperatures reach upwards of 35 degrees Celsius during June, July, and August and for a few months a year drop as low as ‚àí50 degrees Celsius. Rainfall is moderate, with the majority falling during the summer months. The area is noticeably wetter than in surrounding regions, particularly to the south and east. Around a metre of snow falls on the region during winter. During the summer solstice, twilight extends throughout the night and during the winter, night comes quickly. However, the town gets to experience beautiful displays of the Aurora borealis and this helps with the dark.

It is catalogued as Child Ballad No. 181 and Roud 334.The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, Edited by Francis James Child in Five Volumes, Dover Publications, Minneola, New York, 2006.See the detailed treatment in Edward D. Ives's The Bonny Earl of Murray: the Man, the Murder, the Ballad (University of Illinois Press, 1997) Background Castle Doune, Moray's family seat in the late 16th century The ballad touches on a true story stemming from the rivalry of James Stewart, Earl of Moray (pronounced Murray), and the Earl of Huntly, which culminated in Huntly's murder of Moray in 1592. The exact circumstances that led to the murder are not known for certain, but both their families, the Stewarts of Doune (pronounced \\"doon\\") and the Gordons of Huntly, had a history of territorial rivalry and competition for royal favour. In his notes on the ballad, Francis James Child relates how Huntly, eager to prove that Moray was plotting with the Earl of Bothwell against King James VI, received a commission to bring Moray to trial. In the attempt to apprehend Moray, the earl's house at Donibristle in Fife was set on fire and the visiting Sheriff of Moray killed. Moray fled the house, but was chased and killed in its grounds, betrayed, it was said, by the glow of his burning helmet tassle. His last words, according to the (probably apocryphal) story related by Walter Scott, deserve special mention. Huntly slashed him across the face with his sword, and as he lay dying Moray said \\"Ye hae spilt a better face than yer ain\\" (\\"You have spoiled a better face than your own\\"). The killing was widely condemned. Moray's mother, Margaret Campbell, had a painting made of her son's dead body, as evidence of his multiple wounds, bearing the legend \\"God Revenge My Caus\\". Her intention was to show this publicly at the Cross in Edinburgh, but the King ignored her request, effectively withholding permission.Edward D. Ives, The Bonny Earl of Murray: the Man, the Murder, the Ballad, Tuckwell Press, East Linton 1997 Lyrics and themes James VI painted in 1590, two years before the murder The King's reaction in the ballad is to condemn Huntly's action (in verse 2): :\\"Now wae be to thee, Huntly! :And wherefore did you sae? :I bade you bring him wi you, :But forbade you him to slay.\\" Nevertheless, James did not punish Huntly, prompting rumours of his own complicity in the murder. It is possible that the inclusion of the King's clear condemnation of the deed (whether or not it was ever expressed by him) was an effort to prevent the ballad from appearing treasonous. However, we can discount the ballad's claim that Moray was the Queen's lover (hinting at a possible motive for James's complicity). The ballad, which praises Moray as \\"a braw gallant\\" (Scots, calland), was most likely composed by one of his supporters. The words \\"Oh he might have been a king!\\" should not be taken to imply that he could have become King. More likely, they conveyed the sense that he possessed the required attributes of a king and so could easily have been one. It is from the first verse of \\"The Bonnie Earl o' Moray\\" that the term mondegreen, meaning a misheard lyric, came into popular use among folk musicians. :Ye Highlands and ye Lawlands, :Oh where have you been? :They have slain the Earl o' Moray :And layd him on the green. When the ballad is sung in Scots, the form is different from the more anglicised version in the Child catalogue. For example, the verses given above are sung with these words: :Ye Hielands an ye Lowlands :O, whaur hae ye been :They hae slain the Earl o' Moray :And lain him on the green. :Now wae betide thee, Huntly :And whaurfor did ye sae? :I hae bade ye bring him wi ye :But forbade ye him tae slay. A German translation by Johann Gottfried Herder, Murrays Ermordung, published 1778‚Äì79, was set to music by Johannes Brahms in 1858. The ballad was also set to music by Hugh S. Roberton and Benjamin Britten. Mondegreen The American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term \\"mondegreen\\" in an essay \\"The Death of Lady Mondegreen,\\" which was published in Harper's Magazine in November 1954. Drawings by Bernarda Bryson. Reprinted in: Contains the essays \\"The Death of Lady Mondegreen\\" and \\"The Quest of Lady Mondegreen.\\" In the essay, Wright described how, as a young girl, she misheard the final two lines of the above verse as \\"they have slain the Earl o' Moray, and Lady Mondegreen.\\" She said that she always imagined the Earl dying beside his faithful lover \\"Lady Mondegreen\\", and refused to hear the real words, because they were less romantic than her misheard version.

The area, which takes its name from the town of Halayib, is created by the difference in the Egypt‚ÄìSudan border between the \\"political boundary\\" set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the \\"administrative boundary\\" set by the British in 1902, which gave administrative responsibility for an area of land north of the line to Sudan, which was an Anglo-Egyptian client at the time. With the independence of Sudan in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. The area has been considered to be part of Sudan's Red Sea state, and was included in local elections until the late 1980s. In 1994 the Egyptian military moved to take control of the area as part of Red Sea Governorate, and Egypt been actively investing in it since then. Egypt has been recently categorical in rejecting international arbitration or even political negotiations regarding the area. The description of the area as a \\"triangle\\" is a rough approximation. Only the southern demarcation, which follows latitude 22¬∞, is a straight line. While the whole area is north of the 22-degree line, a smaller area south of latitude 22¬∞, referred to as Bir Tawil, joins the Halayib Triangle at its westernmost point along the latitude lineneither Sudan nor Egypt claims Bir Tawil.\\"Colonial Egypt\\" 1912 map The area is sometimes referred to in Egypt as the \\"Sudan Government Administration Area\\" or SGAA. History Map of the Halayib Triangle and Bir Tawil from 1912. The Halayib Triangle has been under Egyptian administration since mid-1990. This map is colored from the Sudanese perspective Although this map of Sudan depicts the Halayib Triangle as part of the country, Sudan does not exercise its jurisdiction over the area Simplified map showing Egypt's claim (yellow and green), Sudan's claim (blue and green), the Halayib Triangle (green) and Bir Tawil (white) On 19 January 1899, an agreement between the UK and Egypt relating to the administration of the Sudan defined \\"Soudan\\" as the \\"territories south of the 22nd parallel of latitude\\". It contained a provision that would give Egypt control of the Red Sea port of Suakin, but an amendment on 10 July 1899 gave Suakin to Sudan instead. On 4 November 1902 the UK drew a separate \\"administrative boundary\\", intended to reflect the actual use of the land by the tribes in the region. The 1902 border assigned administration of the territory of the Ababda tribe south of the 22-degree latitude line to Egypt, and gave to Sudan the grazing land of the Beja tribe north of the line to administer. The Sudan-administered territory comprised about 18,000 km2, including the towns of Halayib and Abu Ramad. When Sudan became independent in 1956, Egypt regarded the latitude 22¬∞ territorial boundary of 1899 as the border between the two countries, while Sudan held to the claimed 1902 administrative boundary. As a result, both Egypt and Sudan claim sovereignty over the territory. Rongxing Guo. Territorial disputes and resource management: a global handbook Nova Publishers, 2007. pp. 132-133. Conversely, the area south of the line which had been administered by Egypt, Bir Tawil, is a terra nullius, claimed by neither country. In February 1958, two years after Sudanese independence, with Sudan planning to hold elections in the Triangle, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt sent troops into the disputed region for the referendum of the proposed unification between Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic,Office of Geography.

Although both countries continued to lay claim to the land, joint control of the area remained in effect until 1992, when Egypt objected to Sudan's granting of exploration rights for the waters off the Triangle to a Canadian oil company. Negotiations began, but the company pulled out of the deal until sovereignty was settled.\\"Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia Accuse Sudan, as Halaib Dispute Flares Up\\" Washington Report, February 1993, page 33 In July 1994, Sudan sent memoranda to the United Nations Security Council, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab League complaining about what it claimed was more than 39 military and administrative incursions by Egypt into Sudanese territory since Sudan had last filed memoranda in May 1993. In January 1995 Egypt rejected a Sudanese request for the OAU Foreign Ministers' Council to review the dispute at their meeting in Addis Ababa.Ofcansky, Thomas. \\"Sudan: Recent History\\" in Then, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak when he arrived in Addis Ababa to attend the meeting, Egypt accused Sudan of complicity, and, among other responses, strengthened its control of the Halayib Triangle, expelling Sudanese police and other officials. In 1998, relations between Egypt and Sudan somewhat improved, and the countries announced their intention to work together to resolve the Halayib Triangle dispute, with increased cooperation between their security forces. Later that year, though, Sudan accused Egypt of harassing Sudanese citizens in the area, a charge which Egypt denied. Nevertheless, by March 1999, the countries were in diplomatic discussions aimed at improving relations between them. During a visit to Egypt by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in December 1999, a joint communique was issued pledging to solve the Halayib dispute \\"in an integrational brotherly context...\\" In January 2000, Sudan withdrew its forces from the area, effectively ceding control of the border zone to Egypt, whose forces have occupied and administered the area since.\\"A View of Sudan from Africa: Monthly Briefing\\" , The Machakos Protocol (August 2002) =21st century= In 2004 Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir claimed that despite his nation's withdrawal in 2000, and Egypt's de facto control of the Triangle, the area still rightfully belonged to Sudan which had \\"never relinquished\\" it. \\"We did not make any concessions.... The proof is that we have recently renewed the complaint to the Security Council,\\" he said, according to the Press. Al-Bashir reiterated the Sudanese claim of sovereignty over Halayib in a 2010 speech in Port Sudan, saying \\"Halayeb is Sudanese and will always be Sudanese.\\"\\"Sudan‚Äôs Bashir reiterates sovereignty over disputed border area of Halayeb\\" Sudan Tribune (1 July 2010) The Eastern Front, a Sudanese politico-military coalition comprising the Beja Congress and Free Lions that signed a peace agreement with Khartoum, has stated that it considers Halayib to be part of Sudan due to its population being ethnically, linguistically and tribally connected to that country. The head of the Eastern Front and Beja Congress, Musa Muhammad Ahmad, has declared that the issue of Halayib's sovereignty should be decided by international arbitration in a similar manner to the issue of sovereignty over Abyei between Northern and Southern Sudan. In October 2009 the Electoral Commission that prepared a comprehensive plan for Sudan's general elections in April 2010 declared that Halayib was one of the Red Sea State electoral districts and that its people should exercise their constitutional rights and register in order to participate in the general elections. Voter registration did not take place in the Halayib Triangle area because the team from the Sudanese election commission was refused entry by Egyptian authorities. In December 2009, the Sudanese presidential assistant Musa Mohamed Ahmed was barred from entering the border area. Ahmed's visit was intended to \\"assert [Sudanese] sovereignty over the Halayib Triangle and inspect the situation of the people and provide moral and financial support to the members of the Sudanese army unit trapped inside since the [Egyptian] occupation began.\\" His remarks were the first official recognition that Sudanese Army personnel remained inside the area of de facto Egyptian control. Ahmed also asserted that the Halayib Triangle is Sudanese and would not be forsaken \\"under any circumstances.\\"\\"Egypt bars Sudanese official from entering disputed border region: report\\" Sudan Tribune (10 December 2009) The government of Egypt is taking steps to close the Egyptian-Sudanese trade center of Alshalateen and move it to the border control pass point on the 22nd parallel, which has had its facilities enlarged and its administrative manpower increased to handle the Egyptian-Sudanese land trade. By doing this, trucks bringing goods to Egypt from Sudan will not be allowed to unload their goods in Alshalateen, as in the past, but instead at the Hadarba border pass point. Wadi Halfa is another border pass point west of the Nile River at 22 degrees north. In 2009 the Egyptian electricity authority was building a line to supply the city of Alshalateen with electric power from the main Egyptian grid to replace the generators being used there. This line will extend in the future to Abu Ramad and Halayib. Since May 2010 a new paved road has connected the triangle to Port Sudan. It was reported in the Sudanese daily Al-Ahram Today on 22 April 2010 that Al-Taher Muhammad Hasaay, the former head of the Halayib Council and a member of the Bisharin tribe who was campaigning against the Egyptian military presence in the Halayib triangle, died in a hospital in Cairo after having been detained by Egyptian security forces without trial for two years. A delegation of the Bisharin tribe stated to the Sudan Media Centre that seven of their members were also in detention: Muhammad Eissa Saeed, who had been in custody for six years, Ali Eissa Abu Eissa and Muhammad Saleem, detained for five years, and Hashim Othman, Muhammad Hussein AbdalHakam, Karrar Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Tahir Muhammad Saleh each in holding for two years.\\"Worry Over the Fate of 8 Halayib Detainees in Egyptian Prisons after the Death of a Fifth Detainee\\" Al-Ahram Today (22 April 2010) In July 2010, it was reported in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that the chiefs of three tribes in the Halayib triangle ‚Äì Ababda, el-Basharya and Beja ‚Äì supported the Egyptian claims for the area, stating that they are Egyptian and not Sudanese citizens, and that they have all the rights of Egyptian citizens, including national identity cards, the right to vote in elections and to serve in the Egyptian military.\\"Halayeb tribes' chiefs assert belonging to Egypt, not Sudan\\" Al-Masry Al-Youm (3 July 2010) (translated from the Arabic edition) On November 29, 2010, an open letter was sent to the President of Sudan by Muhammad Al-Hassan Okair (Toyota) who had been the parliamentary member of Halayib in 1995, from Halayib itself. The letter was written on behalf of the Bisharin, Hamad-Orab and Aliyaab tribes and complained of the forced inclusion of 20 villages that had been administered under indigenous civil society structures into two Egyptian electoral districts. The letter further complained of the siege of Halayib, the fact that its inhabitants live within barbed wire and that anything from Sudan is refused entry on the premise that Halayib is Egyptian and that the tribes' camels are not allowed to travel and graze for pasture in the ancestral lands of the Bisharin from Halayib to the neighbouring state of River Nile in Sudan.\\"Letter from Occupied Halayeb to the Presidential Palace in Khartoum\\" Sudanese Online (29 November 2010) (translated from the Arabic) The Egyptian government converted the village of Halayeb to a city, and various civilian projects are under construction. Mamdouh Ali Omara was elected by the local inhabitants as representative for the Halayeb area in the Egyptian parliamentary election of November 2015. In 2016 an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a brief statement that these are Egyptian territories subject to Egyptian sovereignty, and that Egypt had no additional comment to make. International arbitration requires the consent of the concerned parties, whereas Egypt has been refusing arbitration to date. A new asphalt-paved road has been built which begins south-west of Alshalateen and goes through the western portion of the triangle to the border pass of Suhin (Sohin), which is located at the 22nd parallel. In the future this road will connect to the city of Abu Hamad in Sudan. Parts of the road can be seen on Google Earth and Bing maps. Settlements The major town in the area is Abu Ramad which lies north west of Halayib on the Red Sea coast. Abu Ramad is the last destination of the buses that connect the area to Cairo and the other cities of Egypt such as Aswan, Marsa Alam and Qena. The only other populated place is the small village of Hadarba, south east of Halayib town on the coast. Alshalateen is an Egyptian town just on the northern administrative boundary. The closest Sudanese town south of the disputed area is Osief (Marsa Osief), located south of latitude 22, the political border line claimed by Egypt based on the 1899 agreement. Ecology and geography In the Halayib region, Afrotropical elements have their northern limits at Gebel Elba, making it a unique region among Egypt's dominating Mediterranean and North African ecosystems. There is also dense cover of acacias, mangroves and other shrubs, in addition to endemic species of plants such as Biscutella elbensis. The highest peaks in the area are Mount Elba (), Mount Shellal (), Mount Shendib () and Mount Shendodai (). The mountainous area of Gebel Elba is a nature reserve declared by Egypt in a decree signed by the former prime minister Ahmed Nazif.

Martin employees pose with B-29 Superfortress used in Stratovision tests. In rear row from left are Frank Gordon Mullins and C.E. Nobles, head of Stratovision for Westinghouse. Stratovision was an airborne television transmission relay system using aircraft flying at high altitudes. In 1945 the Glenn L. Martin Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation originally proposed television coverage of small towns and rural areas, as well as the large metropolitan centers, by fourteen aircraft that would provide coverage for approximately 78% of the people in the United States. Although this was never implemented, the system has been used for domestic broadcasting in the United States, and by the U.S. military in South Vietnam and other countries. Technology Because the broadcasting antenna for Stratovision is usually hung beneath the aircraft in flight, it naturally has a great command of Line-of-sight propagation. Although transmission distances are dependent upon atmospheric conditions, a transmitting antenna above the Earth's surface has a line of sight distance of approximately . A Stratovision 25 kW transmitter operating from at 600 MHz will achieve a field intensity of 2 millivolts per meter for a high receiving antenna up to away from the aircraft. Early tests Stratovision tests were undertaken between June 1948 to February 1949. The first phase was undertaken by the Glenn L. Martin Co. and Westinghouse using a twin-engine PV-2 aircraft flying at that transmitted with 250 watts on 107.5 MHz and 5 kW on 514 MHz at Baltimore, Maryland so that recordings could be made at various locations ranging from Norfolk, Virginia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Boston, Massachusetts. The second phase of testing was undertaken by these companies using a stripped-down B-29 Superfortress flying at . The plane was equipped to receive a relay transmission from WMAR-TV in Baltimore, which was then relayed over a 5 kW video transmitter and a 1 kW audio transmitter for reception on 82-88 MHz with a television set tuned to Channel 6. The aircraft received its originating signals from circular dipoles attached to a streamlined eight-foot (2.5 m) mast on top of the aircraft's vertical tail fin. The retractable long broadcasting antenna hung vertically beneath the aircraft. It was composed of a two-element turnstile array for video and a single-element circular dipole for sound transmissions. The receivers, transmitters and necessary air- conditioning were all powered by the plane's engines using three 15 kVA, 500 Hz alternators. Without air conditioning the transmitters in the interior of the aircraft would have generated a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) with an outside air temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius). On 23 June 1948 the system's airborne transmitter rebroadcast the Republican National Convention, being held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the surrounding nine-state area during the 9 to 10 pm EDT time period. As part of the activity, a receiver was set up in a hall in Zanesville, Ohio, a small city on the outskirts of the broadcast area, to demonstrate to the invited newspaper reporters that the system was capable of reaching \\"small town and farm homes\\".Air & Space magazine, Vol 22 No 3, August 2007, \\"Broadcast Bomber\\", p. 18 The tests were watched by many television viewers who sent in reception reports. From these reports it was calculated that Stratovision would require only eight relay planes to provide a transcontinental network and six additional planes to provide coverage to 78 percent of the United States. Charles Edward Nobles, the head of Stratovision for Westinghouse, said in his report: :\\"The major technical problems of the system have been solved, and the commercial development awaits only the crystallization of public demand for the expanded services offered by airborne broadcasting, application of the system by the radio industry to meet this demand, and the clarification of channel facilities available to make possible this application.\\" Education In 1961 a nonprofit organization, Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction, commenced a Stratovision service from the airfield of Purdue University. The effort began as a three-year experiment funded by the Ford Foundation. The program organized, produced and transmitted educational television programs four days a week from a DC-6AB aircraft flying at over the community of Montpelier in north central Indiana. MPATI delivered its programs to television channels 72 (call sign KS2XGA) and 76 (KS2XGD) in the UHF band, by transmitting videotaped lectures from the aircraft to an estimated potential 5,000,000 students in 13,000 schools and colleges. The aircraft were equipped with two videotape machines and two UHF transmitters. When MPATI signed on it used an \\"Indian head\\" test pattern card which was shown for five minutes before and between programs. The service ended in 1968 when it became embroiled in legal action over their application of Stratovision in a controversy with the Westinghouse company. Propaganda =Vietnam War= During the Vietnam War, the United States Navy used Stratovision television technology when it flew Operation Blue Eagle from 1966 to 1972 over the Saigon area of South Vietnam. The television programs were aimed at two audiences on two channels: one was aimed at the general public and the other was intended for the information and entertainment of US troops who were stationed in South Vietnam. On January 3, 1966, a Broadcasting magazine article, \\"Vietnam to get airborne TV: Two-channel service ‚Äîone for Vietnamese, other for U.S. servicemen‚Äîstarts this month\\", noted: > Television broadcasting in South Vietnam ... begins January 21 and it's > going to be done from the air. Two airplanes, circling above the ground, > will broadcast on two TV channels‚Äîone transmitting Saigon government > programs; the other U.S. programs. The project is being handled by the U.S. > Navy. Also involved are the U.S. Information Agency and the Agency for > International Development. Work on modifying two Lockheed Super > Constellations has been underway by Navy electronics experts at Andrews Air > Force Base ... The project is an outgrowth of a broadcasting plane used by > the Navy during the Cuban and Dominican Republic crises when both radio and > television were beamed to home in those countries. The same article went on to report that during the Baseball World Series of October 1965 Stratovision had also been used to bring the games to the troops. The aircraft had picked up Voice of America radio broadcasts from California and relayed the signal to a ground broadcasting station. The Agency for International Development (AID) had purchased through the military Post Exchange Service, 1,000 monochrome, 23-inch television sets modified to operate on a variety of domestic power sources, and which had been airlifted to South Vietnam on December 28, 1965. They were to be put into community facilities around Saigon. AID was also spending $2.4 million to supply a total of 2,500 TV sets to South Vietnam. The entire project was under the control of Captain George C. Dixon, USN. He claimed to be installing AM, FM, shortwave and TV transmitters on the aircraft which would get their power from an onboard 100 kW diesel-fueled generator. The planes would not only relay programs from film chain kinescopes and video recorders, but they would also have live cameras to create their own live programs. Ground transmissions would be received from the aircraft on TV sets tuned to channel 11 for Armed Forces Television, and channel 9 for programs in Vietnamese. On radio the broadcasts would be tuned to 1000 kHz for AM and 99.9 MHz for FM. On 7 February 1966, Broadcasting magazine reported that after working out a number of technical problems that the first show on channel 9 would begin at 7:30 p.m. and feature South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky and U.S. Ambassador Cabot Lodge in a videotaped production, followed by channel 11 at 8 p.m. with General Westmoreland introducing a two-hour program which incorporated one hour of the Grand Ole Opry filmed in Nashville, Tennessee. After that the Vietnamese channel would be seen for one and half hours a day and the U.S. channel for three hours daily. On 8 February 1966 The New York Times article \\"South Vietnamese Watch First TV Show\\" reported that South Vietnamese viewers had to strain their ears because the speakers on the TV sets would need to be amplified if they were going to be heard by a room full of people watching THVN-TV channel 9. The U.S. programming on NWB-TV channel 11 was Bob Hope in a two-hour special called Hollywood Salute to Vietnam, followed by half-an-hour of the Grand Ole Opry and another half-hour of the quiz show I've Got a Secret. The regular line-up of shows included Bonanza, Perry Mason, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. =1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia= EC-130 Commando Solo was used in propaganda warfare during the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with questionable success. Production was very cheap, below local TV standards in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with slide show and narration based news. Quality of reception was very poor and area of coverage was rather small. =Iraq War= During the 2000s, the EC-130 Commando Solo has been used to broadcast information and propaganda for the United States over a variety of television and radio frequencies. It has been used in several areas of operation, including Bosnia and Iraq. Pirate television In 1969, news stories began to appear in the United Kingdom that Ronan O'Rahilly, the founder of the pirate radio ship based service called Radio Caroline, which at that time was not on the air, was about to launch Caroline Television instead. His plans called for two aircraft, one in service and one as a relief, which would transmit commercial television programs to Britain by Stratovision. Although these stories continued for some time, nothing became of the project. To date no pirate radio or television service has ever operated by means of Stratovision. Use as a temporary service The advent of fibre optic cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite services has supplanted Stratovision as a permanent means of television delivery. The Stratovision concept continues to be used as a stop-gap measure where land-based transmitters are not possible and where large areas of territory need to be served with a television program. Popular culture * The plot of the 1986 comedy film Riders of the Storm (also known as The American Way) is based on a similar concept, with a group of Vietnam veterans running a pirate television station (\\"S&M; TV\\") from a B-29 that was constantly in flight. * A similar system, using helicopters, is mentioned in the 1950 Robert A. Heinlein story \\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\".

It started in a small way in 1976 as the Nyon Folk Festival. The first one was held in the village hall in Nyon. From 1977 until 1989, it was held at Colovray, Nyon, by Lake Geneva and had only two stages, but today it is one of the major open-air music festivals in mainland Europe and the biggest in Switzerland. Today the event has grown to include international artists. In 1990, it moved to its current location, at the Plaine de l'Asse, accessible either by walking, bus or the Chemin de fer Nyon-St-Cergue-Morez narrow-gauge railway. The festival lasts six days at the end of July, from Tuesday to Sunday, and the final main stage concert is preceded by a great firework display with music. As of 2005, 3.5 million spectators and 2500 artists had been part of the Pal√©o Festival. Stages The Pal√©o features six stages: * La Grande Sc√®ne (the Main Stage) * Les Arches (Which replaced Le Chapiteau in 2013) * Le Club Tent (the Club Tent) * La Ruche (the hive) (formerly called 'La Crique') * Le D√¥me (the Dome) * Le D√©tour (regional bands now located inside the festival, formerly called 'FMR' which was a free stage) Since 2003, the Pal√©o has introduced Le Village du Monde (The World Village) section, which is a space reserved for an invited region of the world. This place offers the region's culture and food. It also includes Le D√¥me which shows only artists from the invited region. 280,000 visitors and over 5,000 staff participated in the 2015 event. Tickets Tickets can be purchased on the Pal√©o Website. Special offers are available usually as early as November of the year preceding the next Pal√©o festival with discounted all-week passes. Later in Spring the official programme is published and the second, slightly less discounted tickets are available. They are often sold out very quickly. In the months preceding the festival more tickets are sold at full price. To fight black-market ticket sales, 1500 one- day tickets are held up to be sold the same day as their validity date and can be purchased online (to be printed by the buyer). The lineup used to be revealed on a late April Wednesday at noon, following which, both tickets and passes would sell out within days. From 2008 onwards, the lineup is unveiled one week prior to the sale, giving people plenty of time to make up their mind and thus rushing them online to get their tickets one week later. In 2009, all 280,000 tickets and passes were sold in a record one-and-a-half hours. Transportation There are a lot of ways to access the festival, whether by special trains and buses, by car, by bike, or walking.

It is the second game in the Descent video game series and a sequel to Descent. Unlike standard first- person shooters, the player must control a flying ship that has a six degrees of freedom movement scheme, allowing the player to move in any 3D direction. The original soundtrack features industrial metal contributed by notable musicians such as Type O Negative, Ogre and Mark Walk of Skinny Puppy, and Brian Luzietti.http://www.descent2.com/goodies/music/d2_tracklist.shtml The game received very positive reviews from video game critics. A sequel, Descent 3, was released in 1999.  Gameplay  Screenshot featuring the new Guide- Bot. This Guide-Bot is guiding the player to the reactor to destroy. Like its predecessor Descent, Descent II is a six degrees of freedom shooter wherein the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero- gravity. It is differentiated from the standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies and fire flares to explore darkened areas. In the game's single-player mode, the player must complete 24 levels where different types of AI-controlled robots will try to hinder the player's progress. In each level, the player must find and destroy a reactor, then escape the mine through an exit door before the mine self-destructs - failing to escape costs the player a life and all of the points earned on that level. Every fourth level has a boss robot that takes the place of the reactor. Each level is composed of a set of rooms separated by white, blue, yellow, or red doors. White doors can be opened by simply firing weapons at them or bumping into them. However, the other colored doors require a key of the corresponding color to be opened. Along the way, the player may also find and free a Guide- Bot, an assistant that shows the player the way to a specific target. Within each level, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into two different types: primary weapons and secondary weapons. Primary weapons range from a variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Vulcan Cannon, while secondary weapons include different types of missiles and mines. Most primary weapons consume energy at different rates, but some, such as the Vulcan Cannon, use physical ammunition instead. In contrast, each secondary weapon has its own quantity. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special abilities. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the Afterburner allows the player to temporarily fly forward much faster than normal. Additionally, many stages have human hostages that give an additional point bonus if they are rescued before completing the level. The player's ship is protected by a shield which decreases when incurring damage from enemies, weapons (including explosions from the player's weapons), and collisions. If the shield is fully depleted and the ship takes any additional damage, the player loses one life and all rescued hostages, and the ship explodes, leaving most of its power-ups nearby. The player continues back at the start of the level with only basic armaments - to resume where he/she left off, the player must return to the site where the previous ship was destroyed to reclaim his/her power-ups. If a player loses all lives, the game will end. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources, while life points are awarded at certain point levels and by picking up special hidden power-ups in the level. Descent II also features a multiplayer mode wherein two to eight players can compete against each other in several game types. Notable game types include Anarchy, where the objective is to kill as many opponents as possible, and Capture the flag, in which two teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags. Aspects such as time limit, number of opponents killed to end a game, and map to play on, among others, can be customized to match player preference. The game also features a co- operative mode that allows players to work together to complete single-player levels. The official release version of Descent II was originally designed to support the IPX and UDP/IP protocols on local area networks, while third-party services such as Kali provided the ability to play multiplayer games over the Internet. Third-party update projects such as D2X Rebirth have over time made it easier to play Descent II on the Internet without additional programs.  Plot  After the \\"Material Defender\\" has destroyed all of the mines in the solar system in the original Descent, he stops in the Asteroid belt for refueling. PTMC executive S. Dravis then contacts him and blackmails him to accept a new mission: \\"If you've studied your standard mercenary agreement, you would notice that PTMC reserves the right to keep you on retainer for up to 72 hours, post-mission. If you choose to decline further service, we may consider you in default of your contract, and your fee may be suspended, pending litigation. Good luck Material Defender. Dravis out.\\" The Material Defender's ship is fitted with a prototype warp core. He is then sent to clear out PTMC's deep space mines in planets beyond the Solar System. The planets are Zeta Aquilae, Quartzon, Brimspark, Limefrost Spiral, Baloris Prime, and Omega. The Omega system is subdivided into the Puuma Sphere and Tycho Brahe, with the latter being the final level of the game. The last mine on Tycho Brahe seems to run all through a planetoid, which is revealed in the final cutscene to be a large spaceship. After the planetoid/spaceship breaks apart, the Material Defender radios in to alert Dravis to his return home, but his warp drive malfunctions and he ends up in an unknown location. The camera then fades to that location and the ship appears, drifting towards the camera, heavily damaged and crackling with excess radiation.  Development  Descent II was developed by Parallax Software. The game was originally planned as an expansion pack to the original Descent. Both Descent and Descent II use a software renderer, but Descent II is also able to take advantage of the widening selection of 3D graphics accelerator video cards. Graphics were still 8-bit, but due to the additional CD storage space available, instead of using a single palette set during gameplay, each of the six four-level sets had its own 256-color set, and there were effectively six texture sets, each of which had basically the same textures but optimized them specifically for those colors and textures most used in the four-level set. Furthermore, multiple resolutions were supported. The original Descent uses indexed 8-bit color in DOS's display mode 13h, using 320 √ó 200 resolution. The Macintosh and later PC versions allow higher resolutions, such as 640 √ó 480. Descent II allows the resolution maximum to be stretched to 800 √ó 600, or 1280 √ó 1024 with the -superhires option. Like Descent, Descent II operates on the premise of interconnected cubes. Sides of cubes can be attached to other cubes, or display up to two texture maps. Cubes can be deformed so long as they remain convex. To create effects like doors and see-through grating, walls could be placed at the connected sides of two cubes. Descent introduced an elaborate static lighting scheme as well as simple dynamic lighting, another advancement compared to Doom. The environment could be lit with flares, lights could flicker. Newly added for Descent II is that the environment can be darkened by shooting out the lights. The environment is also highly destructible and very interactive. Shooting out certain props, such as control panels and gate switches, would cause for secret doors to be opened.  Releases  The base Descent II game was released for MS-DOS, Mac OS, and RISC OS in 1996. Windows support was also made available.http://www.interplay.com/games/support.php?id=104 Later in 1996 came Descent Mission Builder 2, a Descent and Descent II level editor from third- party developer Brainwarehttp://descent.brainware.net/page-products-dmb-2.php. It is also capable of converting Descent levels into Descent II levels. On November 15, 1996 came Descent II: Vertigo Series, an add-on for Descent II. It contains 23 new levels, two new multiplayer game types, new music, enemies, boss AI and Descent Mission Builder 2. Vertigo series was also released on the same day as a bundle including a Windows 95 upgrade of the base game, The Vertigo Series, and Descent Mission Builder 2, titled Descent II: The Infinite Abyss. On April 30 in the U.S. and May 1, 1997 in the UK, the PlayStation version of Descent II, known as Descent Maximum was released. Instead of a straight port, it included new levels (for a total of 30), textures and FMV over the PC version of Descent II. On October 29, 1997 Descent I and II: The Definitive Collection was released. A compilation, it contains the full version of Descent, Descent II and Descent II: Vertigo Series. In 1998, Descent II was released in a standalone jewel case (as opposed to a box) by SoftKey, with an AOL trial offered on-disc. After the game's initial DOS release, a patch was issued to add support for early 3D accelerators running the S3 ViRGE chipset. Patches (also from Parallax) added Rendition V√©rit√© and 3Dfx Voodoo support further down the line, and the Macintosh version could use RAVE-compatible 3D acceleration as well. Additionally, an unofficial 3Dfx version, known as \\"D2_3DFX\\", was released with Parallax's permission by a member of the 3Dfx developer team, which provided full support for the Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 expansion cards and the Voodoo 3 all-in-one graphics card. This version produced higher frame rates and higher-quality graphics compared to the official Parallax version, and was supported by members of the online community. In 1998, the Descent II source code, like that of Descent before it, was released to the general public, leading to several community patch projects that are fully compatible with modern versions of Windows. =Digital distribution= In January 2007, Descent II was re-released in downloadable form on GameTap. On September 9, 2008, it was bundled with Descent on GOG.com (then known as Good Old Games) as Descent + Descent 2. On February 19, 2014, Descent II was re-released on Valve's Steam digital distribution service. In December 2015, Descent, Descent II and Descent 3 were withdrawn from Good Old Games. A representative of Parallax Software responded to speculation on the Good Old Games forums, regarding the withdrawal of the titles. It was claimed that Parallax- still in existence- owned the copyrights to the first two games, but had not been paid royalties on their sale since 2007 by publisher Interplay. As a result, Parallax had terminated the 21 year sales agreement, meaning Interplay no longer had permission to distribute Descent or Descent II. (This post did not touch on the reasons for Descent 3's removal). Descent and Descent II remained available through Steam , despite Parallax's assertion that this should not be the case. The game was finally removed from Steam in July 2016. However, in November 2017, GOG.com announced that the Descent series would be available for sale again on their platform. The game has now also resurfaced on Steam.  Reception  Upon release, Descent II received very positive reviews from video game critics. Chris Hudak, writing for GameSpot, commented: \\"If you don't like Descent at least a little bit, make no mistake, there is something wrong with you.\\" Todd Vaughn of PC Gamer praised the game's graphics and improved multiplayer features. In a very positive review, Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine considered the Guide-Bot to be a valuable addition to the game \\"because the automap is just as confusing as it was in the original game\\". Geoff Keighley of Computer Games Magazine highlighted positively the enemy AI, but expressed concerns about the lack of outdoor levels (a feature later added in its sequel). Stephen Hill of TotalGames.net concluded: \\"If you don't own Descent, you'd be a fool to pass this sequel over. If you've played the first game to death and are looking for another challenge, then it is still worth a long, hard look.\\" A reviewer for Maximum assessed that while Descent 2 is not a major advance over the original game, it has a much less frustrating difficulty and a Guide-Bot to make up for the confusion of the wireframe map, while retaining the 3D sensations and \\"ingenious structural design\\". A Next Generation critic opined that \\"When it comes to sequels, few can boast the improvements like those made on Descent II.\\" He gave as examples the increase in resolution up to 800x600, the story sequences in full motion video, and the new items. While he remarked that it still follows the same mission formula as the original (find the key, open the door, blow up the reactor, then escape), he found the improvements to be more than sufficient. Next Generation made similar comments of the Macintosh version, and noted it as a then-unusual case of a Macintosh port arriving very shortly after the DOS version. Descent Maximum received more mixed reviews. The most negative reviews came from Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot and Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly, both of whom said they disliked the entire Descent series and its basic concept of 3D navigation in levels which have no clear \\"up\\" or \\"down\\". Smith and his three co-reviewers all criticized that the PlayStation conversion suffers from an extremely choppy frame rate, though Crispin Boyer noted that the problem is largely eliminated when playing with the cockpit displays on (as opposed to full-screen mode). Both Boyer and Dan Hsu praised the additions over the original Descent, such as the Guide-Bot and the new lighting effects. Rubenstein disputed the criticisms of the frame rate, which he called \\"smooth\\", and GamePros Major Mike said the frame rate only drops when the action is at its most intense. He praised the additions to the original Descent such as the FMV cutscenes, the Guide-Bot, and the Thief- Bot. A Next Generation critic was also pleased with these elements, summarizing that the game \\"features just enough improvements to the aging series to make it a welcome addition to the fold.\\" However, he judged that the Descent series lacked the intensity and mood of the better first-person shooters. Descent II was a finalist for CNET Gamecenter's 1996 \\"Best Action Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Quake. The editors wrote, \\"Descent II offered even more insane vertigo action than the original, plus an added bonus that set the tone for computer gaming in 1996--a multiplayer mode.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Descent II the 123rd-best computer game ever released.

Apart from having traditional central bank responsibilities such as financial stability and price stability, it manages The Government Pension Fund of Norway, a stabilization fund that may be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.Monitor Group - SWF AUM 2011 The limited transparency of some SWFs makes it difficult to make accurate assessments of their assets under management.IFSWF Report on Compliance with the Santiago Principles: Admirable but Flawed Transparency On 31 December 2010, the bank had 590 employees. All Executive Board appointments are made by the King of Norway, after a decision by the Council of State. The Chairman of the Executive Board, √òystein Olsen, who presides over the bank, is also the acting Central Bank Governor. Both the Governor and the Deputy Governor make speaking appearances across the country on a number of occasions each year. History The history of the central bank of Norway can be easily traced back to 1816, when, two years after the separation from Denmark and the union with Sweden, Norges Bank was established by Act of the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) on 14 June. The bank then decided that the monetary unit was to be the speciedaler (rixdollar), divided into 120 skillings or five ort (\\"rigsort\\") of 24 skillings each. The Money Act of 17 April 1875 discontinued the terms daler and skilling, and it was decided that the monetary unit should be a krone, divided into 100 √∏re. This was done to prepare for Norway's entry, on 16 October that year, into the Scandinavian Monetary Union. This union had been established between Denmark and Sweden in 1873 on the recommendation of a joint commission (in which Norway participated) to establish a common Scandinavian coin based on gold. It meant that the other countries' coins were to be legal tender on the same basis as those struck at home. The union functioned until 1914; thereafter it lacked all practical significance, but was not formally abolished until 1972. On 1 January 1897 the seat of Norges Bank was moved to Kristiania (Oslo), and in 1906 a new headquarters building on Bankplassen was opened - for 80 employees including the workers in the banknote printing plant. During the second world war, the seat of Norges Bank was temporarily moved to London in 1940, in that the Norwegian government-in-exile established a new board. The bank's gold reserves were evacuated via √Öndalsnes, Molde and Troms√∏ to London, and from there to New York and Ottawa. This gold and the bank's other currency reserves were under the control of the London board. At the same time, the bank continued its operations in Norway under the direction of the Nazis until the war was over and the London board stepped down. A commission of inquiry after the war concluded that the Bank's Oslo management had taken a firm and correct attitude towards the Nazi authorities. In 1962, the Mint Supervisory Authority and the Royal Mint were transferred from the state to Norges Bank. Norges Bank Investment Management NBIM is a separate part of Norges Bank and is responsible for the management of the Government Pension Fund - Global. NBIM also manages Norges Bank's foreign exchange reserves. NBIM invests the fund's assets and the foreign exchange reserves in international equities and fixed income instruments, money market instruments and derivatives.

While it would be possible to make an articulated locomotive of this arrangement, the only 4-4-4-4s ever built were duplex locomotives--with two sets of cylinders driving two sets of driven wheels in one rigid frame, essentially a 4-8-4 with divided drive. Usage Detail, showing the rearward cylinders and gear of the sole N-1. The first locomotive built with this arrangement was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's sole class N-1 #5600 George H. Emerson, constructed at the B&O;'s own Mount Clare Shops in May 1937. To reduce the fixed wheelbase, this locomotive had the two sets of cylinders at opposite ends, so that the rear pair were beside the firebox. This proved to be a poor design, as it restricted the firebox size and exposed the cylinders to dust and dirt, causing premature wear. The locomotive was not considered successful enough to duplicate. The sole N-1 was retired in 1943 and scrapped in 1950. The Pennsylvania Railroad's controversial class T1 duplex locomotive. The next locomotives to use the 4-4-4-4 arrangement were the Pennsylvania Railroad's 52 class T1 locomotives. These had the cylinders in front of the wheels they drove, so that the rear pair were between the two sets of drivers. These locomotives were impressive performers but suffered from wheelslip and severe reliability problems, and did not last long in service. The two prototypes, #6110 and #6111, were constructed at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in April 1942. The mechanical design work had been undertaken by Baldwin's chief engineer Ralph P. Johnson, while the streamlining was the handiwork of industrial designer Raymond Loewy. Both locomotives showed fantastic performance in test trials, leading to the construction of 50 further examples. Numbers 5500 through 5524 would be constructed at the PRR's Altoona Works while 5525 through 5549 would be constructed at Baldwin. As operation continued, problems arose. The T1 class was known for violent uncontrollable wheel slip as well as performance and maintenance issues caused by the Franklin oscillating-cam Poppet valves. The PRR did show interest in trying to solve these problems such as replacing the original poppets on #5500 with easier to maintain Franklin rotary-cam poppet valves and refitting #5547 with Walschaerts valve gears reclassifying the latter engine as a \\"T1a\\". In the end, the PRR decided to stop development of the T1 class, replacing all examples by the mid-1950s with diesel units. All members of the class were scrapped. It is very likely the T1 may have had many of its shortcomings solved had the PRR not retired the short lived class so soon. During its short service life, the T1 was rumored to have operated at higher speeds than the steam speed record set by the London and North Eastern Railway's Mallard, but the claims could not be officially verified. Several bush tramway engine types were built with this wheel arrangement. These were known as \\"16-Wheelers\\". Two notable builders were J. Johnson and Sons Ltd, Invercargill, and A & G Price, Thames, New Zealand. Currently, only one locomotive of the 4-4-4-4 arrangement is being constructed. When finished, PRR 5550 will be the 53rd and only surviving example of the PRR T1 class rather than a replica. Furthermore, the new build T1 is expected to implement some design improvements to help aid in solving problems encountered by the original 52. The estimated date of project completion is currently set around the year 2030. As of November 4th 2019, the project is 34.1% complete with an estimated total cost of US $7,000,000.

He was also influential as a band pedagogue, and greatly affected the field of music education in the USA and abroad. In Fennell's New York Times obituary, colleague Jerry F. Junkin was quoted as saying \\"He was arguably the most famous band conductor since John Philip Sousa.\\"Wakin, Daniel J. Frederick Fennell, 90, Innovative Band Conductor, Dies, The New York Times, December 9, 2004. Retrieved 2010-03-23. Early life Fennell was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He chose piccolo as his primary instrument at the age of seven, as drummer in the fife-and-drum corps at the family's encampment called Camp Zeke. He owned his first drum set at age ten. In the John Adams High School orchestra, Fennell performed as the kettledrummer and served as the band's drum major. His studies at the Interlochen Arts Camp (then the National Music Camp) included being chosen by famed bandmaster Albert Austin Harding as the bass drummer in the National High School Band in 1931. This band was conducted by John Philip Sousa on July 26, the program including the premiere of Sousa's Northern Pines march. Fennell himself conducted at Interlochen at the age of seventeen. Fennell formed a compatible and fruitful relationship with the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. As a student, he organized the first University of Rochester marching band for the football team and held indoor concerts with the band after the football season for ten years. At Eastman, he completed his bachelor's and master's degrees (in 1937 and 1939). Fennell became the first person to whom the Eastman School of Music awarded a degree in percussion performance. He was also awarded a fellowship that allowed him to study at the Mozarteum Salzburg in 1938, where he took several courses with Herbert Albert and visited several times with the festival‚Äôs chief conductor, the renowned Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. Returning, he sailed on the SS Bremen from Southampton on September 3, 1938. For the purpose of the passenger manifest, he signed his name as Frederick Putnam Fennell (a rare use of his middle name). Fennell also studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood in 1942 (with classmates Leonard Bernstein, Lukas Foss and Walter Hendl). He was appointed Koussevitzky‚Äôs assistant at the Center in 1948. During World War II, Fennell served as the National Musical Advisor for the USO (United Service Organizations). Eastman Wind Ensemble While Fennell was recuperating from hepatitis for six weeks in 1952, the idea for a new, smaller type of symphonic band occurred to him: scaling the typical concert band down to the size of the wind section of a symphony orchestra, allowing for greater clarity and better intonation. He recruited nearly 40 players in May 1952 for this, explaining, ‚ÄúI chose the best students in the school, the best solo performers and the best ensemble players.\\" On September 20, 1952 he conducted the first rehearsal for this new Eastman Wind Ensemble, and its first concert at Eastman's Kilbourn Hall on February 8, 1953. Desiring expanded repertoire, he wrote to nearly 400 composers around the world commissioning appropriate compositions for the new group. The first three composers to respond were Percy Grainger, Vincent Persichetti and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Fennell's recordings Conducting the Eastman Wind Ensemble, the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and various other groups, Fennell recorded many of the standards of the wind band repertoire. He became one of America's most-recorded conductors. Starting with \\"American Concert Band Masterpieces\\" in 1953, Fennell recorded over 300 compositions on 29 albums for Mercury Records with the Eastman-Rochester \\"Pops\\", London \\"Pops\\" (actually the London Symphony Orchestra in shirt-sleeves), and free-lance groups of New York musicians. However, best known are the 22 of the 29 Mercury releases made with Fennell's own Eastman Wind Ensemble. One of these albums, Lincolnshire Posy, with music by Percy Grainger (recorded in 1958), was selected by Stereo Review magazine as one of the 50 best recordings of the Centenary of the Phonograph 1877-1977. The two-volume Civil War - Its Music and Its Sounds, recorded in December 1960, was a notable set also made with the Eastman Wind Ensemble, this time performing on period or original instruments. In 1961, Fennell received a citation and a medal from the Congressional Committee for the Centennial of the Civil War for this album. In 2003, the 1958 Mercury album Winds in Hi-Fi was chosen by the National Recording Preservation Board for the National Recording Registry. Nearly all of Fennell's Mercury recordings were reissued on compact disc. Fennell and the Eastman Wind Ensemble were also featured in the premiere issuance of Mercury material on compact disc. In 1986, 24 Sousa marches performed by the Eastman Wind Ensemble were transferred to compact disc by Philips Records, which now owned the Mercury catalog.Mercury 434 300-2, copyright 1992 Philips Classic Productions, manufactured and marketed by PolyGram Classics & Jazz, A Division of Poly Gram Records, Inc., New York, New York. Fennell made the first symphonic digital recording in the United States for Telarc with the Cleveland Symphonic Winds, on April 4‚Äì5, 1978. This recording included the two Suites for Military Band by Gustav Holst. With the Dallas Wind Symphony, Fennell recorded five programs of music by Nelhybel, Albeniz, Grainger, Bernstein and more, for Reference Recordings. Fennell also recorded for Brain, Columbia Records, Delos, King, Kosei, Ludwig, Premier Recordings and Sine Qua Non Superba, not to mention the Library of Congress label. Career After Eastman Fennell was associate music director of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (subsequently renamed the Minnesota Orchestra) from 1962 to 1964. In September 1965 he became conductor- in-residence at the University of Miami, where he conducted its symphony orchestra and also founded a wind ensemble. He also served as the resident conductor of the Miami Philharmonic from 1974 to 1975, and as principal guest conductor of the Interlochen Arts Academy and Dallas Wind Symphony. At the invitation of its players, he was appointed the initial conductor of the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra in 1984. On the podium, he evinced a courtly yet commanding manner despite his diminutive (5'1\\") stature. He was known to take charge of a room with words alone, and his conducting was extremely animated. His conducting workshops were famous for including calisthenics and baton- technique exercises in swimming pools. He remained highly active in the world of conducting until a few months before his death at the age of ninety at his home in Siesta Key, Florida. At the time, he was conductor laureate of the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra; principal guest conductor of the Dallas Wind Symphony; and professor emeritus at the University of Miami Frost School of Music. Awards and honors Fennell received Columbia University's Alice M. Ditson Conductor's Award in 1969, was presented the Star of the Order from the John Philip Sousa Memorial Foundation in 1985, received an honorary doctorate from Eastman in 1988, and was inducted into the National Band Association Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors in 1990. He received the Theodore Thomas Award of the Conductor's Guild in 1994.https://web.archive.org/web/20061006164942/http://www.conductorsguild.org/main.asp?pageID=20 He was also inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2003, he received the Charles E.

He made frequent appearances guest conducting such ensembles as the Boston Pops Orchestra 1949 to 1978, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the United States Marine Band, Interlochen Arts Academy, and the Interlochen Arts Camp. In 1997, he became the first civilian to conduct an entire concert with the United States Marine Band; and in July 1998 he repeated this at a concert in the Kennedy Center celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Marine Band. Fennell was a brother of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music (initiated into the Fraternity's Alpha Nu Chapter at the Eastman School of Music in 1934), and Kappa Kappa Psi, the National Honorary Band Fraternity. Frederick Fennell Hall was dedicated in Kofu, Japan on July 17, 1992. On April 4, 2006, the Interlochen Center for the Arts opened up state of the art music and academic libraries, with the music library named in honor and memory of Fennell and his wife, Elizabeth Ludwig Fennell.http://www.interlochen.org/department/music- library Fennell died in Siesta Key, Florida. His daughter stated that on his deathbed Fennell had said, \\"I cannot die without a drummer.\\" She added that his last words were: \\"I hear him. I'm O.K. now.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/arts/music/frederick- fennell-90-innovative-band-conductor-dies.html Fennell's writings Fennell wrote several books: Time and the Winds, a Short History of the Use of Wind Instruments in the Orchestra, Band and the Wind Ensemble, 1954; The Drummer‚Äôs Heritage, a Collection of Popular Airs and Official U.S. Army Music for Fifes and Drums, 1956; and The Wind Ensemble, 1988. Fennell was commissioned by Grenadilla Music to write a major article on 20th Century band composers and their music. The article was published in volume one of \\"Panorama of 20th Century Classical Music\\" subtitled, \\"BAND! (Wind Ensembles, Brass & Concert Bands\\" and is currently available at www.grenadillamusic.com. He also edited for several music publishers: Boosey & Hawkes, Carl Fischer, Theodore Presser, and Sam Fox. For the Fennell Editions at Ludwig Music he edited over 50 scores for band performance, including many marches. One of these editions published in 1981 was for his favorite march, National Emblem by Edwin Eugene Bagley. He also wrote a series of sixteen articles published in The Instrumentalist under the heading ‚ÄòBasic Band Repertory‚Äô beginning in April 1975 and concluding in February 1984. These articles were devoted to what Fennell called \\"...indestructible masterpieces for band that have survived the ravages of time and many an inept conductor\\". Fennell wrote an original march in 1951, \\"Tally-Ho March,\\" in honor of the Tally-Ho Music Camp and its founders, Fred and Dorotha Bradley. Further reading * The 1993 Roger E.

Steady state implies equilibrium which is never reached, nor are organisms and ecosystems in a closed environment. During his tenure at the State University of New York at Oneonta, Dr William Butts correctly applied the term homeorhesis to biological organisms. The term was first used in biology by C.H.

Gaia hypothesis In ecology the concept is important as an element of the Gaia hypothesis, where the system under consideration is the ecological balance of different forms of life on the planet. It was Lynn Margulis, the coauthor of Gaia hypothesis, who wrote in particular that only homeorhetic, and not homeostatic, balances are involved in the theory.

The Beaufort was originally called the Caledonia. She was built at the Pusey & Jones Company of Wilmington, Delaware in 1854. The Caledonia operated out of Edenton, North Carolina. (Lytle 1975: 28) In 1856 her home port changed from Edenton to Plymouth. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Caledonia, now renamed Beaufort, was put in commission at Norfolk, Virginia on July 9, 1861 by Lieutenant Robert C. Duvall, North Carolina Navy, and sailed immediately for New Bern, North Carolina. While en route she engaged the large steamer USS Albatross in an inconclusive battle off Oregon Inlet. (ORN 6: 21, 790ff) After North Carolina seceded, Beaufort was turned over to the Confederate States Navy, and on September 9 Lieutenant William Harwar Parker, CSN, was placed in command. Thereafter she participated in the battles of Roanoke Island on February 7‚Äì8, 1862, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina two days later. Right before the battle of Elizabeth City Beaufort had to supply most of her crew to man Cobb's Point Battery on the south shore of the Pasquotank River. Thus deprived, Parker ordered Beaufort to escape via the Dismal Swamp Canal to Norfolk. (ORN 6: 596f) In March the Beaufort was tender to CSS Virginia off Hampton Roads on March 8‚Äì9, 1862. In that battle Beaufort moved alongside the US frigate Congress to accept its surrender. Heavy rifle fire from the shoreline drove her away with several casualties. The Beaufort also caused heavy damage to the Minnesota before nightfall. (Parker 1985: 276ff) From May 1862, Beaufort operated on the James River, her commander in November 1863 being Lieutenant William Sharp, CSN. Beaufort served until the evacuation of Richmond, Virginia on April 3, 1865 when she was captured and taken into the United States Navy, the only other Confederate naval vessel, besides the unfinished casemate ironclad , of the James River Squadron to fall unscathed into the hands of its captors.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Series I, Vol. 12, p. 101, 1901 She was sold September 15, 1865.

The series is considered one of the most successful on Greek television, representative of the daily life of Athenians in the early 1990s. Premise The show is about the lives of four friends, the eponymous \\"Aparadektoi\\": Spyros (Spyros Papadopoulos), Dimitra (Dimitra Papadopoulou, who is also the script writer), Yannis (Yannis Bezos) and Vlassis (Vlassis Bonatsos). Spyros and Dimitra have been married for five years, while Yannis and Vlassis are roommates and best friends, despite the fact that the former is a homosexual and the latter a shameless womanizer. All four live on the same floor of an apartment building in Lycabettus, Athens, Greece, in two apartments that share the same terrace. The cast is rounded out by Renia (Renia Louizidou), Vlassis' girlfriend, and Mr. Vassilis (Vassilis Halakatevakis), the landlord. The show's episodes are self-contained - even if hell may have broken loose by the end of an episode (e.g. Dimitra declaring that she will divorce Spyros), the next episode will find everything back to normal. The show is also notable for the unconventional friendship between the characters; even though they describe themselves as friends, the four frequently quarrel, casually badmouth and plot against each other; Spyros and Vlassis often plan to cheat on Dimitra and Renia and vice versa; and so on. Spyros Papadopoulos and Yannis Bezos are widely considered to be among the finest Greek actors of their generation, Dimitra Papadopoulou is one of the most successful female comedians and script writers, and the intro theme was composed/sampled by renowned electronica musician Nikko Patrelakis. Also, Vlassis Bonatsos was a highly successful comedian, singer and TV personality, who died a few years after the show, in 2004. In 2009, MEGA Channel asked Dimitra Papadopoulou to write the script for a new season of episodes, however she rejected the proposal due to the death of the fourth actor (Vlassis). As she explained later, she was shattered by the death of Vlassis Bonatsos, and being loyal to her friend's memory she would never replace his role with another actor. Characters =Spyros= Spyros is an advertising producer. Despite a glorious - according to him - past in the Communist Party of Greece and his participation in the Athens Polytechnic uprising against the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 from November 14 to November 17, 1973, Spyros today is no better than the capitalists he views with disdain. He is obsessed with making and saving money and thus absorbed in his work, while maintaining the theoretical views of a communist. He is short tempered and supposedly the most level headed of the quartet, which makes him often exclaim his catchphrase \\"Ti egine re paidia?\\" (approx. \\"What on earth happened, you guys?\\") while looking at the camera in perplexed demeanour when crazy situations arise. =Dimitra= Dimitra is Spyros' disgruntled wife. Spyros' devotion to his job leave her feeling neglected, leading her in numerous fruitless attempts to arouse her husband's interest in her. She is not as refined as Spyros thinks himself to be, which is often a cause of friction between them. She is insanely jealous of Spyros, often with good reason and she has threatened to divorce him many times during the show's run. =Yannis= Yannis is a fashion designer. He is also a homosexual, a fact that all his friends know and accept. He has a neurotic personality and elitist attitude. This is because he knows he is often the shrewdest one in the gang, but also because being a homosexual in the early 1990s Greece made forming and having an according relationship tricky, a source of much stress for Yannis. His only surviving family, his Aunt Virginia, is in the dark about her nephew's sexuality. =Vlassis= Vlassis works as the main actor in Spyros' commercials. He is also Yannis' best friend and roommate ever since one of his girlfriends broke up with him. Vlassis is laid back and easy going - he enjoys the earthly pleasures of life, like food, drink and especially women. =Renia= Renia works as an advertising model and secretary in Spyros' firm. She is also Vlassis' girlfriend, a pretty shaky term considering Vlassis' flirtatious nature. Renia is young and modern and often introduces new notions for the others to try. Yannis views Renia with disdain, nicknaming her To astropeleki (\\"The thunderbolt\\") due to her unpredictably energetic attitude and inane comments. =Mr. Vassilis= Mr. Vassilis is the landlord of the apartments Spyros, Dimitra, Yannis and Vlassis live in. He tries to have friendly relationships with his tenants but something always puts a crimp in these attempts, such as him demanding overdue rent or being decidedly uncool. He is often the harbinger of bad news to the rest of the gang. Reruns After the show ended its run in January 1993, Mega Channel reran it a multitude of times over the next few years, together with other much-loved series, like Oi Treis Harites. The show ended up being reran in the 1990s more times than any other on Greek television (more than 12 reruns within 5 years). Eventually, a tired television audience and sarcastic TV magazine reviews forced the show off the air after the summer of 1997. In 2004, Mega Channel reran a small number of episodes as part of its 15-year anniversary. After 7 years of absence, this revisit was welcomed by the public. Mega Channel then started rerunning Oi Aparadektoi again on a weekly basis in a prime time slot (Friday 21:00) for a few months.

Based on the short story \\"The Forbidden\\" by Clive Barker, the film follows a Chicago graduate student who was completing a thesis on the urban legends and folklore which led her to the legend of the \\"Candyman\\", the ghost of an artist and son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century for his relationship with a white painter's daughter. The film came to fruition after a chance meeting between Rose and Barker who recently completed his own film adaptation of Nightbreed (1990). Rose expressed interest in Barker's story \\"The Forbidden\\", and Barker agreed to license the rights. Where Barker's story revolved around the themes of the British class system in contemporary Liverpool, Rose chose to refit the story to Cabrini-Green's public housing development in Chicago and instead focus on the themes of race and social class in the inner-city United States. Candyman was released theatrically by TriStar Pictures and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment on October 16, 1992 and grossed over $25 million in the US. It was followed by two sequels, Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) and Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999), with a \\"spiritual sequel\\" of the same name that is set for release in 2021. Candyman is regarded in some critical circles as a contemporary classic of horror cinema. Plot Helen Lyle is a semiotics graduate student in Chicago who is researching urban legends. She hears a local story about the Candyman who can be summoned by saying his name five times to a mirror, causing him to appear and kill the summoner with a hook that was attached to the bloody stump of his right arm. Helen meets two cleaning ladies who claimed that it was the Candyman who killed Ruthie Jean, a resident in the notorious Cabrini-Green housing project. Helen and her colleague Bernadette Walsh look into the case and learn about another twenty-five murders like that of Ruthie Jean's. Skeptical about the legend, Helen and Bernadette repeat the Candyman's name to Helen's bathroom mirror, but nothing happens. Helen decides to write a thesis on how the residents of Cabrini-Green used the Candyman legend to cope with the hardships. She and Bernadette enter the housing project and visit the scene of Ruthie Jean's murder. There, they meet Anne-Marie McCoy and her infant son Anthony who tells her more about the night of the murder. Helen also learns more about the Candyman from Professor Philip Purcell. According to Purcell, the Candyman was the son of a slave who became prosperous by mass- producing shoes after the Civil War. At an early age, he was accepted by the white society. As a well-known artist, he was sought after to paint the portraits of wealthy landowners and their children. After falling in love with a white woman that he was hired to paint and fathering a child with her, the Candyman was set upon by a lynch mob that was hired by his lover's father. They cut off his right hand with a rusty saw and smeared him with honey stolen from an apiary, attracting the bees which stung him to death. His corpse was burned and his ashes were scattered across the land on which Cabrini-Green was built. On a return visit to Cabrini-Green, Helen meets Jake, a young boy who tells Helen that a child was castrated by the Candyman in a restroom. While exploring the restroom, Helen is attacked by a gang leader who carries a hook and calls himself the Candyman. Helen survives the assault with a black eye and identifies her attacker to the police, who believed him to be responsible for the killings. Later, in a parking garage, Helen is confronted by the real Candyman. He tells her that because she discredited his legend, he must \\"shed innocent blood\\" to perpetuate it. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne- Marie's apartment covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose dog was decapitated and baby was stolen, attacks Helen, who is arrested by the police. Helen's husband Trevor, a university professor, bails her out of jail. The Candyman appears again and cuts Helen's neck, causing her to bleed and pass out. Bernadette shows up at Helen's apartment, where she is murdered by the Candyman, who frames Helen for the crime. Helen is sedated and placed in a psychiatric hospital. After a month in the hospital, Helen is interviewed by a psychiatrist named Dr. Burke in preparation for her upcoming trial. She attempts to prove her innocence by summoning the Candyman. The Candyman appears and kills Dr. Burke, allowing Helen to escape. Once Helen is home, she finds Trevor living with Stacey, one of his students with whom he's been having an affair. Helen flees to Cabrini-Green, seeking to confront the Candyman and rescue Anthony. When she finds the Candyman, he tells her that surrendering to him will ensure the baby's safety. Offering Helen immortality, the Candyman opens his coat, revealing a ribcage wreathed in bees. The bees pour out of his mouth as he kisses her, sending the bees down her throat. The Candyman vanishes with Anthony, and Helen discovers a mural of the Candyman and his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to Helen. The mural, as well as a message that was left by the Candyman, implies that Helen is a reincarnation of the Candyman's former lover. The Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him strike fear in Cabrini-Green's residents. In a bid to feed his legend, the Candyman tries to immolate Helen and the child in a bonfire, but he is destroyed in it. Helen saves Anthony, but she is burned severely and dies. The residents, including Anne-Marie and Jake, pay their respects at Helen's funeral. Jake tosses the Candyman's hook into her grave. Afterward, a grief-stricken and guilt-ridden Trevor looks at his bathroom mirror and says Helen's name five times. Helen's vengeful spirit appears and kills Trevor with a hook, leaving his body to be found by Stacey. As the credits begin to roll, in the Candyman's former lair, a new mural of Helen with her hair ablaze is displayed, implying that she entered the local folklore. Cast Production Barker's short story which was set in his native Liverpool was about segregation and the culture of the poor urban areas. For Candyman, Rose was so shocked by Chicago's \\"dynamic\\" architecture and large amount of prejudice that he decided to change the Liverpool location to Chicago. Assisted by members of the Illinois Film Commission, Rose scouted locations in Chicago and found Cabrini Green, a housing project notorious for its poor construction, violence and high robbery rates. The project was also located in between high-class neighborhoods, meaning that the character of Helen could feel Cabrini's chaos from a safe apartment not too far away. This Americanization of the story turned Candyman into an interracial love story where the ghetto residents are now victims of the titular killer. With this change, Rose wanted to showcase those that are living in the poor neighborhoods as regular human beings that are trying to get by which is why he avoided tropes that are common in most American ghetto stories such as gangs and drugs. According to a journalist named Steve Bogira, one source of inspiration may have been a pair of articles that he wrote for the Chicago Reader in 1987 and 1990 about the murder of Ruthie Mae McCoy, a resident of Chicago's Abbot Homes housing project. In 1987, McCoy was killed by an intruder who entered her apartment through an opening behind the bathroom's medicine cabinet. Rose's screenplay garnered a huge amount of attention in the casting agencies and Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd instantly tried to get parts to have a chance to work with the filmmaker. Eddie Murphy was the original choice for the role of Candyman, but the filmmakers could not afford him. Todd, who was fit for playing the killer as he was six-foot-five and physically fit, recalled that there was skepticism from his colleagues about him playing the Candyman due to the amount of bee sting injuries that he would have to receive. He persisted as he wanted to work with the director and said, \\"I've always wanted to find my own personal Phantom of the Opera.\\" While the Candyman's background is unknown in the original story, Todd came up with the backstory for the character in the film. Virginia Madsen was friends with Rose and his then-wife, Alexandra Pigg and Madsen was originally to play the role of Helen's friend, Bernie while Pigg was to play Helen. The choice was made to make the character of Bernie African American so Madsen lost the part. As the shooting was about to commence, Pigg discovered that she was pregnant so the role of Helen was offered to Madsen. Had Madsen been unable to step into the role, a producer named Alan Poul was partial to Sandra Bullock as Helen. Three days of Candyman's filming was spent on Cabrini Green while the other days were spent in scenes on Hollywood sound stages. With plainclothes law enforcement by their side, Todd and Madsen went into the buildings of Cabrini as part of researching their roles which was a useful, but distressing experience for both actors. For playing the Candyman, Todd tried to act as a \\"primeval boogeyman\\" without overacting the part which was tricky to do. He worked with Bob Keen on the Candyman's look. Keen first had Todd wear a machine-controlled fake right arm, but found the movements of the arm too strict. Then, Keen came up with the idea of having Todd wear a hook to indicate the Candyman's supernatural being. He spent three hours making the hook. Todd suggested the character to wear an eyepatch, but Keen rejected the idea. To keep Candyman at a low budget, Rose instructed a special effects manager named Martin Bresson to use traditional effects instead of optical effects. The same team who worked on Backdraft also designed the set for the bonfire scene of Candyman which involved using 1,500 gallons of propane and its largest section having a 70-foot width and 30-foot height. The honeybees in Candyman were controlled by Norman Gary who previously handled the bees on films such as The Deadly Bees (1966), My Girl (1991) and Fried Green Tomatoes (1991). The film used more than 200,000 real honeybees throughout and most of the crew wore bodysuits to be protected from stings, although all of them faced at least one sting. Todd negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for each of the 23 bee stings that he received during filming. In shooting the film's climax where the Candyman sends 500 bees into Helen's face, he first had the bees placed in his mouth by using a protective mouthpiece to avoid as many stings as possible. Gary had to use freshly hatched, non-stinging and non-flying bees for the scene as Madsen was very allergic to stings. It took half an hour for all of the bees to get into Todd's mouth and he recalled being \\"tranced out\\" when he let all of the bees out of his mouth. Rose also utilized hypnosis in his movie to work around what he saw as the cliche of excessive screaming in the horror films. Bernard Rose came up with the idea to have Virginia Madsen hypnotized in the scenes where she confronted the Candyman. According to Todd, this process would occur prior to filming the scenes where he and Madsen interacted and would take roughly ten minutes to prepare. This was accomplished through the use of a professional hypnotist who established a key word that Rose would use to put Madsen under a trancelike state. Score The film's score was composed by Philip Glass. According to Glass, \\"It has become a classic so I still make money from that score, get checks every year.\\" Tony Todd confirmed in an interview with IGN that a limited edition featuring 7500 copies of the film's soundtrack was released in February 2015. Release There was some controversy that the film was depicting racism and racial stereotypes. According to Rose, \\"I had to go and have a whole set of meetings with the NAACP because the producers were so worried and what they said to me when they'd read the script was 'Why are we even having this meeting? You know, this is just good fun.' Their argument was 'Why shouldn't a black actor be a ghost? Why shouldn't a black actor play Freddy Krueger or Hannibal Lecter? If you're saying that they can't be, it's really perverse. This is a horror movie.'\\" At the time of the film's release, Madsen said, \\"I was and am now worried about how people will respond. I don't think Spike Lee will like this film.\\" Candyman had its world premiere at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival, playing as part of its Midnight Madness line-up. It was released on October 16, 1992 in the United States where it made $25.7 million. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Candyman holds an approval rating of 75% based on 67 reviews and an average rating of 6.53/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Though it ultimately sacrifices some mystery in the name of gory thrills, Candyman is a nuanced, effectively chilling tale that benefits from an interesting premise and some fine performances.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Allmovie praised the film, calling it \\"haunting, intelligent and poetic\\" and \\"the finest Barker adaptation ever committed to film\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"Elements of the plot may not hold up in the clear light of day, but that didn't bother me much. What I liked was a horror movie that was scaring me with ideas and gore, instead of simply with gore.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times compared it to \\"an elaborate campfire story\\" with an \\"unusually high interest in social issues\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film Clive Barker's \\"worst to date\\"‚Äîan ambitious, but pretentious film that \\"quickly becomes as repellent as it is preposterous.\\" Variety called it \\"an upper-register horror item that delivers the requisite shocks and gore, but doesn't cheat or cop out.\\" =Home media= It was released on home video in February 1993 by Columbia Tri-Star Home Video. A special edition DVD was released in August 2004. Candyman was first released on Blu-ray format in Australia on September 1, 2011 via Universal Studios. The same Blu-ray version was made available in the United Kingdom on October 10, 2011. The set contains DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 for its original English track as well as standard DTS 2.0 surround for its additional French, Italian, Japanese and Spanish tracks with multiple subtitle options including English SDH and no special features. The film was released again in Australia from Shock Records via their Cinema Cult subsidiary with the only addition being a slipcover. In Germany, a \\"Limited Edition\\" Digibook was made available on May 27, 2016 and was, at the time, the most definitive Blu-ray edition to date. It contains both German and English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0, German and English subtitles and special features including audio commentary, featurettes, storyboards and original trailer. A standard edition set was released in Germany on July 29, 2016. Several standard Blu-ray editions eventually became available in France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Denmark, Finland and Sweden throughout 2011 and 2012. On July 20, 2018, it was announced that Candyman would be released on Blu-ray in a \\"Collector's Edition\\" on November 20, 2018 in the United States via Scream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory. The set contains a newly-remastered 2K restoration from a new 4K scan as well as a number of new special features including an unrated cut, commentaries and featurettes.

It was confirmed for this edition that the film would contain a new DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track for the first time. The set includes a collector's booklet, 6 lobby cards, a reversible poster and reversible cover artwork. It was released on October 29, 2018. Legacy The film came in at number 75 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The character Candyman came in at number 8 on Bloody Disgusting's \\"The Top 13 Slashers in Horror Movie History\\" and ranked the same on Ugo's \\"Top Eleven Slashers\\".Ugo - \\"Top Eleven Slashers\\" The actor who played Candyman, Tony Todd, made #53 on Retrocrush's \\"The 100 Greatest Horror Movie Performances\\" for his role. The film appears in two sections of Filmsite.org's \\"Greatest Scariest Movie Moments and Scenes\\" and \\"Greatest Movie Twists, Spoilers and Surprise Endings\\". In 2001, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills. Sequels Two stand-alone sequels comprising a single storyline were released in 1995 and 1999 respectively: Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh and Candyman: Day of the Dead. In September 2018, it was announced that Jordan Peele was in talks to produce a direct sequel to the 1992 film using his company, Monkeypaw Productions. Todd stated in a 2018 interview with Nightmare on Film Street, \\"I'd rather have [Peele] do it, someone with intelligence who's going to be thoughtful and dig into the whole racial makeup of who Candyman is and why he existed in the first place.\\" In November 2018, it was confirmed that Peele would produce the film with Universal and MGM and will partner with Win Rosenfeld to co-produce the film while Nia DaCosta signed on as director. The film will serve as a \\"spiritual sequel\\", taking place back in the new gentrified Cabrini Green where the old housing projects development once stood in Chicago. Filming was due to commence in spring 2019. In January 2019, it was reported that Lakeith Stanfield (Known for FX's Atlanta and Sorry to Bother You) would possibly star in the film, but not as the main titular character rather as an older version of Anthony McCoy who was a visual artist who took on an interest seeking the legend of the Candyman that was similar to Helen Lyle's character played by Virginia Madsen. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Todd spoke of Peele, stating: \\"I know he's a fan. I'm hoping I will appear in the film in some form of fashion. Wouldn't that make sense? But, it's Hollywood so I won't take it personally if for some reason it doesn't work out.\\" He added, \\"If this new one is successful, it will shed light back on the original. I think the subject matter is more important than any individuals and I mean that.\\" In February 2019, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was in talks to play the titular character. In response to the news, Todd said: \\"Cheers to Candyman, a wonderful character that I've lived with for 25 years. He's brought grace and glory and a beautiful boatload of friends & family. I'm honored that the spirit of Daniel Robitaille & Cabrini Green rises again. Truth to power! Blessings to the cast & crew\\". However, it was ultimately announced that Todd would reprise his role. If Beale Street Could Talk actress Teyonah Parris was cast opposite in playing Abdul-Mateen's character Anthony's girlfriend. Other added cast are Fear The Walking Dead star Colman Domingo and Misfits star Nathan Stewart-Jarret. Production for the film began in August 2019 and wrapped in September 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. The working title of the film was revealed on some of the cast and crew social media pages as Say My Name which was discreetly used in the revised scripts and production sets to keep things \\"flying under the radar\\" with the official title also being Candyman. The film will be released in 2021.

It has had a long history among elite and popular opinion in the United States. At times, the degree and nature of this policy was better known as isolationism, such as the period between the world wars. Background Robert Walpole, Britain's first Whig Prime Minister, proclaimed in 1723: \\"My politics are to keep free from all engagements as long as we possibly can.\\" He emphasized economic advantage and rejected the idea of intervening in European affairs to maintain a balance of power.Felix Gilbert, \\"The English Background of American Isolationism in the Eighteenth Century,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1944) 1#2 p 142 Walpole's position was known to Americans. However, during the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress debated about forming an alliance with France. It rejected non-interventionism when it was apparent that the American Revolutionary War could be won in no other manner than a military alliance with France, which Benjamin Franklin successfully negotiated in 1778.George C. Herring, From colony to superpower: US foreign relations since 1776 (2008). pp 14-23 After Britain and France went to war in 1792, George Washington declared neutrality, with unanimous support of his cabinet, after deciding that the treaty with France of 1778 did not apply.Herring, From colony to superpower pp 66-73 Washington's Farewell Address of 1796 explicitly announced the policy of American non-interventionism: :The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities. No entangling alliances (19th century) President Thomas Jefferson extended Washington's ideas about foreign policy in his March 4, 1801 inaugural address. Jefferson said that one of the \\"essential principles of our government\\" is that of \\"peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none.\\" He also stated that \\"Commerce with all nations, alliance with none, should be\\" the motto of the United States.https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/thomas_jefferson_169575 In 1823, President James Monroe articulated what would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine, which some have interpreted as non-interventionist in intent: \\"In the wars of the European powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken part, nor does it comport with our policy, so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded, or seriously menaced that we resent injuries, or make preparations for our defense.\\" It was applied to Hawaii in 1842 in support of eventual annexation there, and to support U.S. expansion on the North American continent. After Tsar Alexander II put down the 1863 January Uprising in Poland, French Emperor Napoleon III asked the United States to \\"join in a protest to the Tsar.\\"Raico, Ralph.

Civilization Calls, poster by James Montgomery Flagg, 1917 President Theodore Roosevelt's administration is credited with inciting the Panamanian Revolt against Colombia, completed November 1903, in order to secure construction rights for the Panama Canal (begun in 1904). President Woodrow Wilson was able to navigate neutrality in World War I for about three years, and to win 1916 reelection with the slogan \\"He kept us out of war.\\" The neutrality policy was supported by the tradition of shunning foreign entanglements, and by the large population of immigrants from Europe with divided loyalties in the conflict. America did enter the war in April 1917, however. Congress voted to declare war on Germany, 373 to 50 in the House of Representatives and 82 to 6 in the Senate. Technically the US joined the side of the Triple Entente only as an \\"associated power\\" fighting the same enemy, not as officially allied with the Entente.The Encyclopedia of World War I: A - D., Volume 1, p.1264 ABC-CLIO, 2005. A few months after the declaration of war, Wilson gave a speech to Congress outlining his aims for conclusion of the conflict, labeled the Fourteen Points. That American proclamation was less triumphalist than the stated aims of some other belligerents, and its final point proposed that a \\"general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.\\" After the war, Wilson traveled to Europe and remained there for months to labor on the post-war treaty, longer than any previous Presidential sojourn outside the country. In that Treaty of Versailles, Wilson's \\"general association of nations\\" was formulated as the League of Nations. Protest march to prevent American involvement in World War II before the attack on Pearl Harbor. =Isolationism between the World Wars= In the wake of the First World War, the non- interventionist tendencies gained ascendancy. The Treaty of Versailles, and thus, United States' participation in the League of Nations, even with reservations, was rejected by the Senate in the final months of Wilson's presidency. Republican Senate leader Henry Cabot Lodge supported the Treaty with reservations to be sure Congress had final authority on sending the U.S. into war. Wilson and his Democratic supporters rejected the Lodge Reservations, The strongest opposition to American entry into the League of Nations came from the Senate where a tight-knit faction known as the Irreconcilables, led by William Borah and George Norris, had great objections regarding the clauses of the treaty which compelled America to come to the defense of other nations.

The Dawes Plan refinanced war debts and helped restore prosperity to Germany, In August 1928, fifteen nations signed the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact, brainchild of American Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand.Adler, 213 This pact that was said to have outlawed war and showed the United States commitment to international peace had its semantic flaws.Adler, 217 For example, it did not hold the United States to the conditions of any existing treaties, it still allowed European nations the right to self-defense, and it stated that if one nation broke the Pact, it would be up to the other signatories to enforce it.Adler, 214‚Äì215 The Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact was more of a sign of good intentions on the part of the US, rather than a legitimate step towards the sustenance of world peace. The economic depression that ensued after the Crash of 1929, also continued to abet non-intervention. The attention of the country focused mostly on addressing the problems of the national economy. The rise of aggressive expansionism policies by Fascist Italy and the Empire of Japan led to conflicts such as the Italian conquest of Ethiopia and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. These events led to ineffectual condemnations by the League of Nations. Official American response was muted. America also did not take sides in the brutal Spanish Civil War.  As Europe moved closer to war in the late 1930s, the United States Congress continued to demand American neutrality. Between 1936 and 1937, much to the dismay of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts. For example, in the final Neutrality Act, Americans could not sail on ships flying the flag of a belligerent nation or trade arms with warring nations. Such activities had played a role in American entrance into World War I. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland; Britain and France subsequently declared war on Germany, marking the start of World War II. In an address to the American People two days later, President Roosevelt assured the nation that he would do all he could to keep them out of war. However, his words showed his true goals. \\"When peace has been broken anywhere, the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger,\\" Roosevelt said. Even though he was intent on neutrality as the official policy of the United States, he still echoed the dangers of staying out of this war. He also cautioned the American people to not let their wish to avoid war at all costs supersede the security of the nation. The war in Europe split the American people into two camps: non- interventionists and interventionists. The two sides argued over America's involvement in this World War II. The basic principle of the interventionist argument was fear of German invasion. By the summer of 1940, France suffered a stunning defeat by Germans, and Britain was the only democratic enemy of Germany.Adler, Isolationist Impulse, 259.The Annals of America, vol. 16, (Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 1968),6, N.B. The Annals of America is a multivolume collection of primary sources grouped by year. In a 1940 speech, Roosevelt argued, \\"Some, indeed, still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we ‚Ä¶ can safely permit the United States to become a lone island ‚Ä¶ in a world dominated by the philosophy of force.\\"The Annals of America, vol. 16, 8. A national survey found that in the summer of 1940, 67% of Americans believed that a German-Italian victory would endanger the United States, that if such an event occurred 88% supported \\"arm[ing] to the teeth at any expense to be prepared for any trouble\\", and that 71% favored \\"the immediate adoption of compulsory military training for all young men\\". Ultimately, the ideological rift between the ideals of the United States and the goals of the fascist powers empowered the interventionist argument. Writer Archibald MacLeish asked, \\"How could we sit back as spectators of a war against ourselves?\\"The Annals of America, vol. 16, (Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 1968),4, N.B. The Annals of America is a multivolume collection of primary sources grouped by year. In an address to the American people on December 29, 1940, President Roosevelt said, \\"the Axis not merely admits but proclaims that there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and our philosophy of government.\\" However, there were still many who held on to non-interventionism. Although a minority, they were well organized, and had a powerful presence in Congress.Adler, Isolationist Impulse, 257. Pro-German or anti-British opinion contributed to non- interventionism. Roosevelt's national share of the 1940 presidential vote declined by seven percentage points from 1936. Of the 20 counties in which his share declined by 35 points or more, 19 were largely German-speaking. Of the 35 counties in which his share declined by 25 to 34 points, German was the largest or second-largest original nationality in 31. Non-interventionists rooted a significant portion of their arguments in historical precedent, citing events such as Washington's farewell address and the failure of World War I.Adler, Isolationist Impulse, 284. \\"If we have strong defenses and understand and believe in what we are defending, we need fear nobody in this world,\\" Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, wrote in a 1940 essay.Annals of America, 71. Isolationists believed that the safety of the nation was more important than any foreign war.Annals of America, 75 As 1940 became 1941, the actions of the Roosevelt administration made it more and more clear that the United States was on a course to war. This policy shift, driven by the President, came in two phases. The first came in 1939 with the passage of the Fourth Neutrality Act, which permitted the United States to trade arms with belligerent nations, as long as these nations came to America to retrieve the arms, and pay for them in cash. This policy was quickly dubbed, 'Cash and Carry.'Adler, Isolationist Impulse 257. The second phase was the Lend-Lease Act of early 1941. This act allowed the President \\"to lend, lease, sell, or barter arms, ammunition, food, or any 'defense article' or any 'defense information' to 'the government of any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States.'\\"Adler, Isolationist Impulse 282. American public opinion supported Roosevelt's actions. As United States involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic grew with incidents such as the sinking of the , by late 1941 72% of Americans agreed that \\"the biggest job facing this country today is to help defeat the Nazi Government\\", and 70% thought that defeating Germany was more important than staying out of the war. After the attack on Pearl Harbor caused America to enter the war in December 1941, isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh's America First Committee and Herbert Hoover announced their support of the war effort. Isolationist families' sons fought in the war as much as others. = Non-interventionism after World War II = Ohio Senator Robert A Taft was a leading opponent of interventionism after 1945, although it always played a secondary role to his deep interest in domestic affairs. Historian George Fujii, citing the Taft papers, argues: :Taft fought a mostly losing battle to reduce government expenditures and to curtail or prevent foreign aid measures such as the British loan of 1945 and the Marshall Plan. He feared that these measures would \\"destroy the freedom of the individual, freedom of States and local communities, freedom of the farmer to run his own farm and the workman to do his own job\\" (p. 375), thereby threatening the foundations of American prosperity and leading to a \\"totalitarian state\\" (p. 377).George Fujii. \\"Review of Wunderlin, Clarence E., Robert A. Taft: Ideas, Tradition, and Party in U.S. Foreign Policy (Biographies in American Foreign Policy) and Wunderlin, Clarence E. Jr.., ed., The Papers of Robert A. Taft, Volume 3: 1945-1948.\\" H-Diplo, H-Net Reviews. December, 2005\\" In 1951, in the midst of bitter partisan debate over the Korean War, Taft increasingly spoke out on foreign policy issues. According to his biographer James T. Patterson: :Two basic beliefs continued to form a fairly consistent core of Taft's thinking on foreign policy. First, he insisted on limiting America's overseas commitments. [Taft said] \\"Nobody today can be an isolationist.... The only question is the degree to which we shall take action throughout the entire world.\\" America had obligations that it had to honor ‚Äì such as NATO ‚Äì and it could not turn a blind eye to such countries as Formosa or Israel. But the United States had limited funds and problems at home and must therefore curb its commitments....This fear of overcommitment was rooted in Taft's even deeper faith in liberty, which made him shrink from a foreign policy that would cost large sums of money, increase the power of the military, and transform American society into what he called a garrison state. Norman A. Graebner argues: :Differences over collective security in the G.O.P. were real in 1952, but Taft tried during his pre-convention campaign to moderate his image as a \\"go-it-aloner\\" in foreign policy. His whole effort proved unsuccessful, largely because by spring the internationalist camp had a formidable candidate of its own in Dwight D. Eisenhower. As the personification of post-1945 American commitment to collective security, particularly in Europe, General Eisenhower had decided to run because he feared, apparently, that Taft's election would lead to repudiation of the whole collective security effort, including NATO. Eisenhower won the nomination and secured Taft's support by promising Taft a dominant voice in domestic policies, while Eisenhower's internationalism would set the foreign-policy agenda.Patterson, p. 577 Graebner argues that Eisenhower succeeded in moving the conservative Republicans away from their traditional attacks on foreign aid and reciprocal trade policies, and collective security arrangements, to support for those policies.Graebner, p 249 By 1964 the Republican conservatives rallied behind Barry Goldwater who was an aggressive advocate of an anti-communist internationalist foreign policy. Goldwater wanted to roll back Communism and win the Cold War, asking \\"Why Not Victory?\\" Non-interventionism in the 21st century During the presidency of Barack Obama, some members of the United States federal government, including President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, considered intervening militarily in the Syrian Civil War. A poll from late April 2013 found that 62% of Americans thought that the \\"United States has no responsibility to do something about the fighting in Syria between government forces and antigovernment groups,\\" with only twenty-five percent disagreeing with that statement. A writer for The New York Times referred to this as \\"an isolationist streak,\\" a characterization international relations scholar Stephen Walt strongly objected to, calling the description \\"sloppy journalism.\\" According to Walt, \\"the overwhelming majority of people who have doubts about the wisdom of deeper involvement in Syria‚Äîincluding yours truly‚Äîare not 'isolationist.' They are merely sensible people who recognize that we may not have vital interests there, that deeper involvement may not lead to a better outcome and could make things worse, and who believe that the last thing the United States needs to do is to get dragged into yet another nasty sectarian fight in the Arab/Islamic world.\\" In December 2013, the Pew Research Center reported that their newest poll, \\"American's Place in the World 2013,\\" had revealed that 52 percent of respondents in the national poll said that the United States \\"should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\\" This was the most people to answer that question this way in the history of the question, one which pollsters began asking in 1964. Only about a third of respondents felt this way a decade ago. A July 2014 poll of \\"battleground voters\\" across the United States found \\"77 percent in favor of full withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2016; only 15 percent and 17 percent interested in more involvement in Syria and Ukraine, respectively; and 67 percent agreeing with the statement that, 'U.S. military actions should be limited to direct threats to our national security.'\\" Conservative policies Rathbun (2008) compares three separate themes in conservative policies since the 1980s: conservatism, neoconservatism, and isolationism. These approaches are similar in that they all invoked the mantle of \\"realism\\" and pursued foreign policy goals designed to promote national interests. Conservatives, however, were the only group that was \\"realist\\" in the academic sense in that they defined the national interest narrowly, strove for balances of power internationally, viewed international relations as amoral, and especially valued sovereignty. By contrast, neoconservatives based their foreign policy on nationalism, and isolationists sought to minimize any involvement in foreign affairs and raise new barriers to immigration.Brian C.

Conservatism, Neoconservatism, and Isolationism in the Foreign Policy Ideology of American Elites,\\" Political Science Quarterly 2008 123(2): 271-299 Former Republican Congressman Ron Paul favored a return to the non-interventionist policies of Thomas Jefferson and frequently opposed military intervention in countries like Iran and Iraq.

Founded in Camden Town, it is now located in Edgware, in the London Borough of Harrow. Two sister schools were opened - one in South Korea, on Jeju Island, and one in Dubai, both are coeducational day and boarding schools offering the British curriculum. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association. History The North London Collegiate School was founded by Frances Buss, a pioneer in girls' education. It is generally recognised as the first girls' school in the United Kingdom to offer girls the same educational opportunities as boys, and Miss Buss was the first person to use the term 'Headmistress'. The small school opened in 1850 at No.46 (later renumbered No.12) Camden Street, London. Buss believed in the importance of home life and it remained a day school.Scrimgeour, Ruby Margaret, (ed.), The North London Collegiate School, 1850‚Äì1950: a hundred years of girls' education, (Oxford University Press), In 1929, the school bought Canons, a modest villa built by William Hallett Esq, on the site of a palatial residence originally built in the early 18th century by the Duke of Chandos, and relocated to the property (designed by Sir Albert Richardson) in 1940. Lucinda Elizabeth Shaw, mother to George Bernard Shaw was a director of music at the school, followed in 1908 by Lilian Manson, J.B. Manson's wife. Her ambitious revival of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1910 gained coverage in The Times.Buckman, David (1973), James Bolivar Manson, p. 9, Maltzahn Gallery Ltd, London. The school introduced a house system in 2014, with the houses being named after noted past pupils. The houses have colours, and each house has two house captains amongst the pupils (a year 9 and a year 11), and a staff head of house. Today the school caters to girls from ages 4 to 18. It comprises a Junior School (Reception to Year 6) and Senior School (Year 7‚Äì13). Former pupils are known as ONLs, short for Old North Londoners. The uniform of North London Collegiate School is light blue and dark brown in colour, however uniform is not compulsory in sixth form. The co-ed boarding North London Collegiate School Jeju opened in Seogwipo, South Korea in 2011.NLCS Jeju Curriculum North London Collegiate is one of the most academically successful schools in England, having been placed in the top two in the Daily Telegraph exam league tables every year for over a decade. It has been an International Baccalaureate World School since October 2003 . Girls may choose to take the traditional A Levels or the Pre-U or the IB curriculum. The girls are also encouraged to participate in non-academic pursuits. The Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme is available similarly to all independent schools.

The name Noel has been given to both boys and girls on this holiday since the Middle Ages. According to the US Social Security Administration, girls named Noel ranked #587 in popularity in 1987. The diaeresis (¬®) can be used over the e and is used when there are two vowels next to one another that should be pronounced as separate syllables instead of a diphthong. It should not be confused with the umlaut (also two dots), a diacritical mark that represents a change in the pronunciation of the letter. Other nicknames and modern variations for girls named Noel are: Noele, Noeline, Nowell, Noela, Noell, Noella, Noelene, Noelene, Noeleen, and the French specific feminine spelling distinguished by the adding the \\"le\\", Noelle. Noel derives from the old French No√´l \\"Christmas\\", a variant (and later a replacement) of nael, which itself derives from the Latin natalis \\"birth\\".

Biography Henrietta Chalupetzky was the only child of a Viennese goldsmith and studied music in Vienna, adopting her mother's maiden name, Treffz, for professional purposes. Her career took her around Austria, as well as Germany and France, but it was in England that she first appeared with Johann Strauss I in concerts that would bring her numerous accolades and felicitations. The Musical World, published in London on 5 May 1849, noted her talents: \\"mezzo-soprano voice of beautiful quality and remarkable for freshness and equality of tone throughout the register\\". On 27 August 1862, Henrietta (known affectionately as \\"Jetty\\") Treffz married Johann Strauss II in the Stephansdom in Vienna, a marriage which was beneficial to Strauss as her support and keen musical and business sense, influenced his works and promoted them to a superior standard. His works around that time revealed his finest creative period, as she worked together with him, as a music-copyist and private secretary, as well as what we will be familiar today as a manager in the music world. Their marriage was not without skepticism. The Viennese populace, long swayed by Strauss' graceful waltzes, were shocked at the announcement of their marriage, as she was forty-four when they married, about seven years older than Strauss. Even his brother Josef Strauss expressed his concern at the match, although he eventually accepted that she was 'indispensable in the home. She writes up all accounts, copies out orchestral parts and sees to everything in the kitchen with such efficiency and kindness that is admirable' in a letter dated 2 May 1869 written to his wife, Caroline. Treffz's encouragement for Strauss to apply for the coveted \\"KK Hofballmusik- direktor\\" post eventually bore positive results, as he was awarded the honorary position in 1863. Last years Jetty Treffz lived long enough to see her husband claim a small but encouraging success in the operetta business, however, on 8 April 1878, she suffered a heart attack and died, aged 59, the cause being reported as a disturbing letter from one of her illegitimate sons. She often spoke of herself as a 'poor, old cripple' as well as suffering from painful illnesses in the last years of her life. She was buried in the local Hietzing cemetery, although Strauss was absent at the funeral, and all arrangements were left to his brother Eduard Strauss. Strauss himself remarried seven weeks later, to Ernestine Dittrich on 28 May 1878.

The primary symptom is diarrhea, which can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include bloating, heartburn, feeling tired, lactose intolerance, and foul-smelling stool. Complications can include anemia and kidney stones. Most cases are due to the surgical removal of a large portion of the small intestine. This is most often required due to Crohn's disease in adults and necrotising enterocolitis in young children. Other causes include damage to the small intestine from other means and being born with an abnormally short intestine. It usually does not develop until less than of the normally small intestine remains. Treatment may include a specific diet, medications, or surgery. The diet may include slightly salty and slightly sweet liquids, vitamin and mineral supplements, small frequent meals, and the avoidance of high fat food. Occasionally nutrients need to be given through an intravenous line, known as parenteral nutrition. Medications used may include antibiotics, antacids, loperamide, teduglutide, and growth hormone. Different types of surgery, including an intestinal transplant, may help some people. Short bowel syndrome newly occurs in about three per million people each year. There are estimated to be about 15,000 people with the condition in the United States. It is classified as a rare disease by the European Medicines Agency. Outcomes depend on the amount of bowel remaining and whether or not the small bowel remains connected with the large bowel. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of short bowel syndrome can include: * Abdominal pain * Diarrhea and steatorrhea (oily, bulky stool, which can be malodorous) * Fluid depletion * Weight loss and malnutrition * Fatigue Persons with short bowel syndrome may have complications caused by malabsorption of vitamins and minerals, such as deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, K, B9 (folic acid), and B12, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. These may appear as anemia, hyperkeratosis (scaling of the skin), easy bruising, muscle spasms, poor blood clotting, and bone pain. Causes Short bowel syndrome in adults and children is usually caused by surgery. This surgery may be done for: * Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract * Volvulus, a twisting of the small intestine often caused by intestinal malrotation that quickly cuts off blood supply and leads to tissue death * Tumors of the small intestine * Injury or trauma to the small intestine * Necrotizing enterocolitis (premature newborn) * Bypass surgery to treat obesity * Surgery to remove diseases or damaged portion of the small intestine Some children are also born with an abnormally short small intestine, known as congenital short bowel. Pathophysiology The length of the small intestine can vary greatly, from as short as to as long as . On average it is about . Due to this variation it is recommended that following surgery the amount of bowel remaining be specified rather than the amount removed. Short bowel syndrome usually develops when there is less than 2 meters (6.6 feet) of the small intestine left to absorb sufficient nutrients. In a process called intestinal adaptation, physiological changes to the remaining portion of the small intestine occur to increase its absorptive capacity. These changes include: * Enlargement and lengthening of the villi found in the lining * Increase in the diameter of the small intestine * Slow down in peristalsis or movement of food through the small intestine Diagnosis =Definition= Intestinal failure is decreased intestinal function such that nutrients, water, and electrolytes are not sufficiently absorbed. Short bowel syndrome is when there is less than of working bowel and is the most common cause of intestinal failure. Treatments Symptoms of short bowel syndrome are usually addressed with medication. These include: * Anti-diarrheal medicine (e.g. loperamide, codeine) * Vitamin, mineral supplements and L-glutamine powder mixed with water * H2 blocker and proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid * Lactase supplement (to improve the bloating and diarrhea associated with lactose intolerance) In 2004, the USFDA approved a therapy that reduces the frequency and volume of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), comprising: NutreStore (oral solution of glutamine) and Zorbtive (growth hormone, of recombinant DNA origin, for injection) together with a specialized oral diet. In 2012, an advisory panel to the USFDA voted unanimously to approve for treatment of SBS the agent teduglutide, a glucagon- like peptide-2 analog developed by NPS Pharmaceuticals, who intend to market the agent in the United States under the brandname Gattex. Teduglutide had been previously approved for use in Europe and is marketed under the brand Revestive by Nycomed. Surgical procedures to lengthen dilated bowel include the Bianchi procedure, where the bowel is cut in half and one end is sewn to the other, and a newer procedure called serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), where the bowel is cut and stapled in a zigzag pattern. Heung Bae Kim, MD, and Tom Jaksic, MD, both of Children's Hospital Boston, devised the STEP procedure in the early 2000s. The procedure lengthens the bowel of children with SBS and may allow children to avoid the need for intestinal transplantation. As of June 2009, Kim and Jaksic have performed 18 STEP procedures. The Bianchi and STEP procedures are usually performed by pediatric surgeons at quaternary hospitals who specialize in small bowel surgery. Prognosis There is no cure for short bowel syndrome except transplant. In newborn infants, the 4-year survival rate on parenteral nutrition is approximately 70%. In newborn infants with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, 5 year survival is approximately 20%. (mean follow-up time was 5.1 years) Some studies suggest that much of the mortality is due to a complication of the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), especially chronic liver disease. Much hope is vested in Omegaven, a type of lipid TPN feed, in which recent case reports suggest the risk of liver disease is much lower. Although promising, small intestine transplant has a mixed success rate, with postoperative mortality rate of up to 30%. One-year and 4-year survival rate are 90% and 60%, respectively.

Transitional ballistics, also known as intermediate ballistics,Ballistics at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, Accessed April 27, 2009 is the study of a projectile's behavior from the time it leaves the muzzle until the pressure behind the projectile is equalized, so it lies between internal ballistics and external ballistics.Physics 001 The Science of Ballistics accessed Apr 27, 2009 The transitional period Transitional ballistics is a complex field that involves a number of variables that are not fully understood; therefore, it is not an exact science. When the bullet reaches the muzzle of the barrel, the escaping gases are still, in many cases, at hundreds of atmospheres of pressure. Once the bullet exits the barrel, breaking the seal, the gases are free to move past the bullet and expand in all directions. This expansion is what gives gunfire its explosive sound (in conjunction with the sonic boom of the projectile), and is often accompanied by a bright flash as the gases combine with the oxygen in the air and finish combusting. The propellant gases continue to exert force on the bullet and firearm for a short while after the bullet leaves the barrel. One of the essential elements of accurizing a firearm is to make sure that this force does not disrupt the bullet from its path. The worst case is a muzzle or muzzle device such as a flash-hider that is cut at a non-square angle, so that one side of the bullet leaves the barrel early; this will cause the gas to escape in an asymmetric pattern, and will push the bullet away from that side, causing shots to form a \\"string\\", where the shots cluster along a line rather than forming a normal Gaussian pattern. Most firearms have muzzle velocities in excess of the ambient speed of sound, and even in subsonic cartridges the escaping gases will exceed the speed of sound, forming a shock wave. This wave will quickly slow as the expanding gas cools, dropping the speed of sound within the expanding gas, but at close range this shockwave can be very damaging. The muzzle blast from a high powered cartridge can literally shred soft objects in its vicinity, as careless benchrest pistol shooters occasionally find out when the muzzle slips back onto their sandbag and the muzzle blast sends sand flying. Initial velocity calculation The initial velocity (Vo) and real muzzle velocity (Vr) difference During the first part of the intermediate ballistics period the real velocity of the projectile increases. It is caused by the propellant gases exiting the muzzle. For that reason the real maximum projectile velocity (Vmax) is higher than the real muzzle velocity (Vr). The external ballistics uses so-called initial velocity Vo, which is not the same as the real muzzle velocity. The initial velocity Vo is calculated via an extrapolation of the decaying part of velocity curve to the position of the muzzle (to). The difference between these two velocities is visible in the chart. Altering transitional ballistics In addition to the process of \\"crowning\\" a barrel to ensure a clean and accurate exit of the bullet, there are a number of devices that attempt to harness the muzzle blast for various reasons. =Suppressing the blast= Flash suppressors and sound suppressors are the most obvious devices that operate in the transitional ballistics realm. These both alter the flow of the escaping gas to reduce the effects of the muzzle blast. Flash suppressors introduce turbulence into the mixing of fuel-laden hot gases escaping from the muzzle and the surrounding oxygen-rich air, reducing combustion efficiency and thus reducing the size and brightness of the flash. Sound suppressors slow the expansion of gases, allowing it to cool and reducing the rate at which it escapes to prevent a shockwave from forming. A recoil compensator is designed to direct the gases upwards at roughly a right angle to the bore, in essence making it a small rocket that pushes the muzzle downwards, and counters the \\"flip\\", or rise of the muzzle caused by the high bore line of most firearms. These are often found on \\"raceguns\\" used for action shooting and in heavy, rifle caliber handguns used in metallic silhouette shooting. In the former case, the compensator serves to keep the sights down on target for a quick follow-up shot, while in the latter case they keep the heavy recoil directed backwards, preventing the pistol from trying to twist out of the shooter's grip. A muzzle brake is designed to redirect the muzzle blast backwards, and therefore counter the recoil of the bullet. Muzzle brakes tend to be found on larger firearms, such as magnum rifles and artillery. A well designed muzzle brake can significantly reduce recoil, turning a rifle that would otherwise be punishing to shoot into a far more tolerable experience. A good example may be seen on the M82 Barrett sniper rifle. There are downsides to both recoil compensators and muzzle brakes. They direct more of the muzzle flash to the sides or back towards the shooter--this is especially true of muzzle brakes. While eye and ear protection should always be used when shooting, this is even more essential with the muzzle blast directed back towards the shooter. Brakes and compensators are often quite bulky, adding length, diameter, and mass to the muzzle end of the firearm where it will affect the firearm's handling worst. While a simple slot milled in the barrel, such as those used in Magna-Porting, will provide some benefit, efficient redirection of the gas flow requires large ports and baffles to deflect as much gas as possible. It is also highly inadvisable to fire sabot rounds like shotgun slugs or APDS rounds through a muzzle brake not designed for them.

It lies some 6 km from the centre of Paris in the north-western suburbs of the French capital. It is the most densely populated town in Europe and, together with neighbouring Neuilly-sur- Seine, one of the most expensive suburbs of Paris.https://www.thelocal.fr/20181029/how-brexit-has-made-one-paris-suburb- the-most-expensive-place-to-buy-in-france Name The name Levallois-Perret comes from two housing developments, Champerret (started by landowner Jean- Jacques Perret in 1822) and Village Levallois (founded by developer Nicolas- Eug√®ne Levallois in 1845), which resulted in the incorporation of the commune. History On the territory of what is now Levallois-Perret, before the French Revolution, stood the village of Villiers and the hamlet of Courcelles (or La Planchette). They now give their names to two Paris M√©tro stations. At the time of the creation of French communes during the French Revolution, they were part of the commune of Clichy, and the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine extended over what is now the south-western part of Levallois-Perret. Landowner Jean-Jacques Perret initiated a number of housing developments in 1822 in the northeast of the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine, in a place which soon came to be known as Champerret (\\"champ Perret\\": \\"Perret field\\") and would later give its name to a station on the Paris M√©tro. Later in 1845, Nicolas- Eug√®ne Levallois began to develop housing on behalf of Andr√© No√´l, who owned land near La Planchette (in the commune of Clichy). The land developed by Levallois soon became known as the Village Levallois. In the 1860s, the village had grown to the point of forming a single built-up area and several requests were made to the authorities for the area to be incorporated as a commune. Typical street in Levallois Eventually the requests were acceded to and on 30 June 1866 the commune of Levallois-Perret was eventually created by detaching that part of the territory of Clichy on which stood the Village Levallois stood and merging it with that part of Neuilly-sur-Seine occupied by Champerret. The Eiffel company had its factory in the commune, and it was therefore in Levallois-Perret that the structure of the both the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower were built. Levallois-Perret became an important centre of the early French automotive industry with the establishment there of such companies as Cl√©ment-Bayard, Delage, and the coachbuilders Chapron and Faget & Varnet. Citro√´n purchased the Cl√©ment-Bayard factory and produced the famous Citro√´n 2CV there for nearly forty years. Levallois-Perret was also an important centre of the cosmetics industry in the early 20th century. It is also home to the large European commercial real estate company Atisreal and to the conglomerate Alstom. The northern part of the famous √éle de la Jatte in the river Seine, is where French impressionist painters created many of their masterpieces. Patrick Balkany has been the mayor of Levallois-Perret for more than 18 consecutive years. He was also mayor during the period 1983‚Äì95. His wife, Isabelle Balkany Smadja, works for the municipality.

Coat of arms Levallois-Perret's Coat of Arms The modern logo The traditional coat of arms for the municipality puts emphasis on the importance of industry in its history. The centre of the arms consists of a shield with red background; a yellow gearwheel in the bottom left and a yellow perfume diffuser in the top right represent the mechanical and perfume industries. Three red bees, are depicted on a silver bend from the top left to bottom right of the shield, these are another symbol of work in the city, beekeeping taking place at the √Æle de la Jatte. The coat of arms also has a wreath at the bottom around the shield and three castles topping the shield; both in yellow. VILLE DE / LEVALLOIS ‚Äì PERRET, is inscribed in black letters above the coat of arms. A cartoon-style bee is used in the modern emblem of the municipality.

It solidified the unification between the Kingdom of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Background The conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) and the Congress of Berlin 1878 left Bulgaria divided into two sections. The area north of the Balkan Mountains and Sofia became an autonomous principality. Eastern Rumelia between the Balkan and Rhodope mountains gained semi- autonomous status with an Ottoman appointed Christian governor. The Bulgarian Assembly chose Prince Alexander Battenberg as their ruler and continued to press for the reunification of their country. Political changes in 1883 caused a cooling in relations between Bulgaria and their protector Russia, who now opposed reunification. In September 1885 a rebellion broke out in Eastern Rumelia. Alexander was placed in a difficult position. Russian opposition if he supported the revolt, or the loss of his throne unless he retained leadership of the Bulgarian national movement. He decided to keep his throne. In response the Russians recalled all their officers which left the Bulgarian army virtually leaderless above the rank of Captain. The Bulgarian army concentrated their limited forces in Eastern Rumelia, expecting an Ottoman attack that never materialised. The actual threat came from the west in the shape of King Milan's Serbia. Bulgarian unification upset the balance of power in the Balkans and Milan demanded compensation. The Armies The Bulgarian field army in 1885 consisted of just under 30,000 men organised into 8 three- battalion infantry regiments (700 men each), 9 squadrons of cavalry and 12 eight-gun batteries. In addition, the first line of the Eastern Rumelia militia had been mobilised consisting of 12 infantry battalions, 2 squadrons of cavalry and 4 guns. During the war the second ban of the Eastern Rumelia militia was mobilised (12 battalions) along with the Bulgarian second ban (8 battalions) and as many as 20 volunteer battalions, 3 Macedonian battalions and some 6000 Muslim volunteers. Confident of an easy victory and to some extent recognising that the war was not popular in Serbia, Milan only mobilised the active (first ban) army. This gave a field army of 5 divisions consisting of 80 battalions (700 men), 21 cavalry squadrons and 46 batteries. A total of 70,000 men and 264 guns. In fact, only 49 battalions and 23 batteries were ready for the invasion, the rest, along with elements of the second ban. only became available in the last stage of the war. A key weakness was the limited number of modern Krupp and du Bange guns. The Opening Moves Serbia declared war on 13 November 1885 and crossed the lightly defended north-western border in three columns. The main army in the centre (≈†umadija, Danube and Drina divisions). To the south the Morava division and to the north the Timok division. The plan was to break through the Bulgarian defences and concentrate four divisions before Sofia. In response Alexander had to move his army from Eastern Rumelia to Sofia by all means available including the one limited railway line. One infantry regiment marched 95 km in 32 hours. The light Bulgarian forces on the Serbian border succeeded in slowing the Serbian advance in mountainous terrain which favoured the defence. Gradually reinforcements arrived at the previously prepared defensive position at Slivnitsa, 30 km north-west of Sofia. Slivnitsa 17/19 November 1885 Alexander arrived on the evening of the 16th to find a well prepared defensive position manned by 9 battalions, plus some 2000 volunteers and 32 guns, commanded by Major Guchev. The position consisted of nearly 4 km of trenches and artillery redoubts either side of the main road on a ridge in front of Slivnitsa village. To the right was steep mountainous terrain whilst the left wing had the easier Visker Hills towards Breznik. The three Serbian centre divisions also arrived on the 16th and halted to recover after the fierce Bulgarian delaying action in the Dragoman Pass. The Morava division was at Tran some distance from its objective Bresnik to the south. The northern advance was bogged down along the Danube. The morning of the 17th came with rain and mist but not the expected Serbian attack. By 10am Alexander ordered three battalions to advance on the right. They surprised the Danube division who eventually rallied and pushed them back. The main Serbian attack began on the centre largely unsupported by artillery which had insufficient range. The weight of Bulgarian fire forced them back with some 1200 casualties. A relief column led by Captain Benderev recaptured the heights on the right and forced the Danube division back to the road. At daybreak on the 18th the Serbians attacked the weaker left flank of the Bulgarian line. Just in time two battalions of the Preslav Regiment arrived to shore up the position. Further attacks in the centre were repulsed with heavy Serbian casualties and Benderev captured two further positions in the mountains. On the 19th the Serbians concentrated two divisions for an attack on the Bulgarian left near Karnul (today Delyan, Sofia Province) in an attempt to join up with the Morava division. However, three battalions of Bulgarian troops led by Captain Popov from Sofia had held the Morava division in the Visker Hills and the flanking move failed. Alexander now ordered a counterattack which pushed the Serbians back on both flanks although nightfall prevented a complete collapse. The Bulgarians Advance Slivnitsa was the decisive battle of the war. The Serbians fought only limited rearguard actions as they retreated and by 24 November they were back in Serbia. The Timok division in the north continued the siege of Vidin until 29 November. The main Bulgarian army crossed the border in two strong divisions (Guchev and Nikolaev) supported by flanking columns and converged on Pirot. The Serbian army dug in on the heights west of the town. On 27 November the Bulgarian army flanked the right of the Serbian position with Prince Alexander personally leading the final attack. The Serbians were defeated and fled to Ni≈°. On the 28th the Austrians intervened and a ceasefire was agreed. Serbian casualties totalled 6,800 compared to 2,300 Bulgarians. Serbian sources state that the casualties in this battle totaled 3,000 for the Serbs vs 2,500 for the Bulgarians, and. 7,000 for the Serbs vs 5,000 for the Bulgarians in the whole war. The Treaty of Bucharest 1886 effectively confirmed the unification of Bulgaria. A major achievement for an army shorn of its senior officers. Unfortunately for Prince Alexander Russia continued to oppose his reign and he was deposed by the Russophile officers in August 1886.  References  * B.

It developed on the southern shore of Bedford Basin and existed from the early 1800s to the 1960s. From 1970 to the present, a protest has occupied space on the grounds. The government has recognized it as a commemorative site and established a museum here. The community has become an important symbol of Black Canadian identity, as an example of the \\"urban renewal\\" trend of the 1960s that razed similarly racialized neighbourhoods across Canada, and the struggle against racism. Africville was founded by Black Nova Scotians from a variety of origins. Many of the first settlers were formerly enslaved African Americans from the Thirteen Colonies, Black Loyalists who were freed by the Crown during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812. (Blacks settled in Africville along Albemarle Street, where they had a school established in 1785 that served the Black community for decades under Rev. Charles Inglis.)https://www.smu.ca/webfiles/fingard-educationofthepoorinhfx-1973.pdf Other residents arrived later, in association with blacks being recruited from the American South for jobs in mining at Glace Bay. During the 20th century, Halifax neglected the community, failing to provide basic infrastructure and services such as roads, water, and sewerage. The city continued to use the area as an industrial site, notably introducing a waste-treatment facility nearby in 1958. The residents of Africville struggled with poverty and poor health conditions as a result, and the community's buildings became badly deteriorated. During the late 1960s, the City of Halifax condemned the area, relocating its residents to newer housing in order to develop the nearby A. Murray MacKay Bridge, related highway construction, and the Port of Halifax facilities at Fairview Cove to the west. Soon after this, former residents and activists began a long protest on the site against their treatment and the condemnation. In 1996 the site was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada as being representative of Black Canadian settlements in the province and as an enduring symbol of the need for vigilance in defence of their communities and institutions. After years of protest and investigations, in 2010 the Halifax Council ratified a proposed \\"Africville Apology\\", under an arrangement with the federal government, to compensate descendants and their families who had been evicted from the area. In addition, an Africville Heritage Trust was established to design a museum and build a replica of the community church.  History  Africville has been claimed as one of \\"the first free black communities outside of Africa,\\" along with other settlements in Nova Scotia. = Early settlement = First known as the \\"Campbell Road Settlement,\\" Africville began as a small, poor, self-sufficient rural community of about 50 people during the 19th century. The earliest colonial settlement of Africville began with the relocation of Black Loyalists, former slaves from the Thirteen Colonies who escaped from rebel masters and were freed by the British in the course of the American Revolutionary War. The Crown transported them and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia, promising land and supplies for their service. The Crown also promised land and equal rights to refugees of the 1812 War. In 1836, Campbell Road was constructed, creating an access route along the north side of the Halifax Peninsula. After starting with the Cornwallis Street Baptist Church in 1832, clergyman Richard Preston established the Seaview African United Baptist Church in Africville in 1849, as one of five others in Halifax: Preston (1842), Beechville (1844), Hammonds Plains (1845), and Dartmouth. Accordingly, Preston is credited as a co-founder of the African United Baptist Association, a network of Black Baptist churches throughout Nova Scotia. While the community was never officially established, the first land transaction documented on paper was dated 1848. The first two landowners in Africville were William Arnold and William Brown. In the late 1850s, the Nova Scotia Railway, later to become the Intercolonial Railway, was built from Richmond to the south, bisecting Africville with the railway's main line along the western shores of Bedford Basin. The community became known as 'Africville' around 1900.Withrow, Alfreda. 1999. One City, Many Communities. Halifax: Nimbus Publishing. p. 11 Many people believed the name came as result of those who lived there having came from Africa; however, this was not the case. One elderly resident of Africville has been quoted as saying, \\"It wasn't Africville out there. None of the people came from Africa.‚Ä¶ [I]t was part of Richmond (Northern Halifax), just the part where the colour folks lived.\\"Africville Genealogy Society. 1992. The Spirit of Africville. Halifax: Formac Publishing Company Limited. Strangers later moved into Africville to take advantage of its unregulated status, selling illicit liquor and sex, largely to the mass of transient soldiers and sailors passing through Halifax. A second railway line appeared in 1906 with the arrival of the Halifax and Southwestern Railway, which connected to the Intercolonial at Africville. The Intercolonial Railway, later Canadian National Railways, constructed Basin Yard west of the community, adding more tracks. Trains ran through the area constantly. = Halifax Explosion = With haphazardly positioned dwellings that ranged from small, well-maintained, and brightly painted homes to tiny ramshackle dwellings converted from sheds, the community had a peak population of 400 at the time of the Halifax Explosion in 1917.Clairmont, Donald H., and Dennis William Magill. [1974] 1999. Africville: The Life and Death of a Canadian Black Community. Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press. Elevated land to the south protected Africville from the direct blast of the explosion and the complete destruction that levelled the neighbouring community of Richmond. However, Africville suffered considerable damage. Four Africville residents (as well as one Mi'kmaq woman visiting from Queens County, Nova Scotia) were killed by the explosion. A doctor on a relief train arriving at Halifax noted Africville residents \\"as they wandered disconsolately around the ruins of their still standing little homes.\\"Metson, Graham, ed. 1978. \\"Personal Narrative Dr. W.B. Moore.\\" In The Halifax Explosion 6 December 1917. McGraw- Hill Ryerson Limited. p. 107. In the aftermath of the disaster, Africville received modest relief assistance from the city, but none of the reconstruction and none of the modernization invested into other parts of the city at that time.Boyd, Michelle Hebert. 2007. Enriched by Catastrophe: Social Work and Social Conflict after the Halifax Explosion. Halifax: Fernwood Publishing. Beginning in the early 20th century around the Great War, more people had moved there, drawn by jobs in industries and related facilities developed nearby. Daily life = Economy = Economically, the first two generations were not prosperous, as labourers had limited opportunities. Many men found employment in low-paying jobs; others worked as seamen or Pullman porters, who would clean and work on train cars. This steady employment on the Pullman cars was considered prestigious at the time, as the men also got to travel and see the country. Only 35% of labourers had regular employment, and 65% of the people worked as domestic servants. Women were also hired as cooks, to clean the hospital or prison, and some elderly women were hired to clean upper-class houses. = Education = The community was neglected in terms of education. The city built the first elementary school here in 1883, at the expense of community residents. Being a poor community, none of the teachers up until 1933 had obtained formal training.Clairmont, Donald H., and Dennis William Magill. 1974. Africville: The Life and Death of a Canadian Black Community. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited. Only 40% of boys and girls received any education at all, as many families needed to have them help with paid work, or by taking care of younger siblings at home so parents could work. Out of the 140 children ever registered, 60 children reached either grade 7 or 8, and only four boys and one girl reached grade 10. = Church = Monument at the site of Africville beside the A. Murray MacKay Bridge To understand Africville, \\"you got to know about the church;\\" the life and heart of the town. The Seaview African United Baptist Church was established at Africville in 1849; it joined with other black Baptist congregations to establish the African Baptist Association in 1854. The community's social life revolved around the church, which was the place of baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Other black groups came to Africville for Sunday picnics and events. Everything was done through the church, \\"clubs, youth organizations, ladies' auxiliary and Bible classes.\\" = Hockey = The Africville Seasides hockey team, of the pioneering Colored Hockey League (1894‚Äì1930), won the championship in 1901 and 1902, beating West End Rangers from Prince Edward Island to retain their title in a 3‚Äì2 single game victory in February 1902. The team was led by star goaltender William Carvery, his two brothers on the team, along with three Dixon brothers also on the squad.  Relationship with Halifax  Throughout its history, Africville was confronted with isolation. The town never received proper roads, health services, water, street lamps or electricity. Residents protested to the city and called for municipal water supply and treatment of sewage, to no avail. The lack of these services had serious adverse health effects on residents. Contamination of the wells was so frequent that residents had to boil their water before using it for drinking or cooking. From the mid-19th century, the City of Halifax located its least desirable facilities in the Africville area, where the people had little political power and property values were low. A prison was built there in 1853, an infectious disease hospital in 1870, as well as a slaughterhouse, and a depository for fecal waste from nearby Russellville. In 1958, the city decided to move the town garbage dump and landfill to the Africville area. While the residents knew they could not legally fight this, they illegally salvaged the dump for usable goods. They would get clothes, copper, steel, brass, tin, etc. The dump contributed to the city's classifying this area as an official slum.  Razing  The founding families of Africville are listed on the Africville Monument at Seaview Memorial Park. Scholars have concluded that the razing of Africville was a confluence of \\"overt and hidden racism, the progressive impulse in favour of racial integration, and the rise of liberal-bureaucratic social reconstruction ideas.\\" During the 1940s and 1950s in different parts of Canada, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments were working together for urban renewal, particularly after the Allied victory in World War II: there was energy to redevelop areas classified as slums and relocate the people to new and improved housing.Loo, Tina. 2010. \\"Africville and the Dynamics of State Power in Postwar Canada.\\" Acadiensis 39(2):23‚Äì47. (PDF) The intent was to redevelop some land for \\"higher\\" uses with greater economic return: business and industry. Other notable racialized neighbourhoods razed under the banner of urban renewal include The Ward in Toronto, and Rooster Town in Winnipeg. Many years earlier, and again in 1947 after a major fire burnt several Africville houses, officials discussed redevelopment and relocation of Africville. But more concrete plans of relocation did not officially emerge until 1961. Stimulated by the \\"Stephenson Report\\" of 1957 and the establishment of Halifax's Department of Development in 1961, the city proposed relocation of these residents. In 1962, Halifax City Council adopted the relocation proposal unanimously, and the \\"Rose Report\\" (publ. 1964) was passed 37/41 in favour of relocation.Walker, James W. St. G. 1997. \\"Allegories and Orientations in African-Canadian Historiography: The Spirit of Africville.\\" Dalhousie Review 77(2):155‚Äì80. p. 160. = Formal relocation and demolition = The formal relocation took place mainly between 1964 and 1967. The residents were assisted in their move by Halifax transporting them and their goods using the city's garbage trucks. This image forever stuck in the minds and hearts of people; they took it to represent the degrading way they were treated before, during, and after the move. Many former residents believe that the city council had no plans to turn Africville into an industrial site, and that racism was the basis of the community's destruction. They believe that the city wanted to remove from Halifax a concentrated group of Black people for whom they had no regard. Because of the city's continued negative response to the people of Africville, the community failed to develop, and this failure was then used as a rationale to destroy it. There were many hardships, suspicion and jealousy that emerged, mostly due to complications of land and ownership claims. Only 14 residents held clear legal titles to their land. Those with no legal rights were given a $500 payment and promised a furniture allowance, social assistance, and public housing units. Young families believed they had enough money to begin a new life, but most of the elderly residents would not budge; they had much more of an emotional connection to their homes. They were filled with grief and felt cheated out of their property. Resistance to eviction became more difficult as residents accepted the buyouts and their homes were demolished. The city quickly demolished each house as soon as residents moved out. Occasionally the city would demolish a house whenever an opportunity presented itself‚Äîsuch as when a resident was in the hospital. On 20 November 1967, the church at Africville was demolished at night to avoid controversy, a year before the city officially possessed the building. There is controversy around the documentation, which shows the church was sold in 1968; the page has been edited by hand to forge the sale as a year earlier. Internal city government documents show the demolition order being sent in 1967, with a claim that the building was dangerous. At the time, it was still in use: residents remember the church being bulldozed in 1967, shortly after the last active service; another service was being planned for the end of the year. It was bulldozed with the vital records of many residents inside, such as birth, marriage, and death records, which could have established chains of custody for land claims. The last Africville home was demolished on 2 January 1970.\\"Africville  Canada‚Äôs Most Famous Black Community.\\" DeCosta 400. Archived from the original on 1 October 2011. = Aftermath = After relocation to public housing within the city limits, the residents had new problems: cost of living went up in their new homes, more people were unemployed and without regular incomes, none of the promised employment or education programs were implemented, and the city's promises went unfulfilled. \\"Benefits were so modest as to be virtually irrelevant‚Ä¶within a year and a half this post-relocation program lay in ruins.\\" Family strains and debt forced many to rely on public assistance, and anxiety was high among the former residents. One of the biggest complaints was that \\"they feel no sense of ownership or pride in the sterile public housing projects.\\"Clyde, Farnsworth. 1995. Uprooted and Now Withered by Public Housing. New York: H.J. Raymond & Co. p. 1. Post-razing legacy Part of the former territory of Africville is occupied by a highway interchange that serves the A. Murray MacKay Bridge. The port development at Fairview Cove did not extend as far east as Africville, leaving its historic waterfront intact. In light of the controversy related to the relocation, the city of Halifax created the Seaview Memorial Park on the site in the 1980s, preserving it from development. The park was most often used as an off-leash dog park. Eddie Carvery has been living on the Africville site since 1970 in protest of the razing, despite city officials seizing his trailers several times. Likewise, former Africville residents carried out periodic protests at the park throughout the 1980s and 1990s.John Tattrie, The Hermit of Africville, Pottersfield Press, Halifax (2010) The Africville Genealogy Society was formed in 1983 to track former residents and their descendants. Halifax mayor Peter Kelly offered land, some money, and various other services for a replica of the Seaview African United Baptist Church. After the offer was made in 2002, the Africville Genealogy Society requested some alterations to the Halifax offer, including additional land and the possibility of building affordable housing near the site. The area that once was Africville was thereby declared a national historic site in 2002. = Africville apology = In May 2005, New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia MLA Maureen MacDonald introduced a bill in the provincial legislature called the Africville Act. The bill called for a formal apology from the Nova Scotia government, a series of public hearings on the destruction of Africville, and the establishment of a development fund to go towards historical preservation of Africville lands and social development in benefit of former residents and their descendants. On 23 February 2010, the Halifax Council ratified a proposed \\"Africville apology,\\" with an arrangement with the Government of Canada to establish a $250,000 Africville Heritage Trust to design a museum and build a replica of the community church. The dedicated site was a area. On 24 February 2010, Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly made the Africville Apology, apologizing for the eviction as part of a $4.5 million compensation deal. The City restored the name Africville to Seaview Park at the annual Africville Family Reunion on 29 July 2011.\\"Halifax park renamed Africville.\\" CBC News. 29 July 2011.  Africville Museum  A building designed to mimic the Seaview African United Baptist Church, demolished in 1969, was erected in the summer of 2011 to serve as a museum and historic interpretation centre. The nearly complete church was ceremonially opened on 25 September 2011.\\"Africville replica church celebrated.\\" CBC News. 25 September 2011.Arsenault, Dan. 26 September 2011. \\"Tears and memories mark Africville church opening.\\" Halifax Chronicle Herald. The opening ceremonies included a gospel concert, several church services, and the release of a compilation audio album with archival recordings of songs sung in Africville. Since then, the Museum has given tours of the site, put on a number of exhibits, commissioned a play about the beginnings of Africville, and organized a number of fundraisers and petitions, including to add a transit stop at and accessibility improvements to the museum. The Africville Museum continues to have problems with area use, including local residents who continue to use Seaview Park as a dog park; and vandals, who are putting graffiti on signs, and disrupting trust efforts to identify the sites of former houses. A civil lawsuit has been filed seeking individual compensation for property in Africville. =Tributes and related media= Text on the site of Africville, near the Seaview Baptist Church in Halifax, NS, Canada.

His poetry plays a major role in Indo-Persian classical music of central Asia as well. Many Afghan classical musicians, e.g. Mohammad Hussain Sarahang, have sung plenty of Bƒ´del's ghazals.

Davidson was a Fellow at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge and a leading member of the The Folklore Society. She specialized in the study Celtic and Germanic religion and folklore, on which she was the author of numerous influential works. Early life Hilda Ellis Davidson was born in Bebington, Cheshire, England on 1 October 1914, the daughter of Henry Roderick (a stationer) and Millie Cheesman Ellis. Davidson received a First Class Honours degree in English, Archaeology and Anthropology from Newnham College, Cambridge. She gained both her M.A. (1939) and Ph.D. (1940) at Newnham. Her Ph.D. thesis was on Old Norse religion. Davidson would eventually become proficient in many languages, including Old Norse, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Russian, Latin and German. Early career Davidson began her academic career as an assistant lecturer in English at Royal Holloway, University of London (1939-1944) Her first book The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception ofthe Dead in Old Norse Literature (1943), published under her maiden name Hilda Ellis, notably utilized archaeological evidence for the examination of death in Norse paganism. This was a pioneering approach, as the study of Old English and Old Norse in British academia at the time was strictly concerned with literary and linguistic concerns. Davidson's utilization of an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Old Norse religion was to become a strong characteristic of her research. From 1945 to 1955 she was a lecturer in the extramural department at Birkbeck, University of London. Although encountering a significant amount of opposition to her attempt at combining archaeological and philological evidence for the study of Old Norse and wider Germanic religion, Davidson continued with her research. In subsequent years, she published a number of notable works, including The Sword in Anglo-Saxon England (1962), Gods and Myths of Northern Europe (1964), Pagan Scandinavia (1967), and Scandinavian Mythology (1969). With Peter Gelling, she published The Chariot of the Sun (1969). During this time, Davidson contributed many papers to scholarly journals, where she often drew on her knowledge of myth, legend and folklore to interpret archaeological finds. She received a research award from the Leverhulme Trust in 1964 for her work in the Soviet Union. Return to Cambridge The Ledberg stone of √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden depicts an event from Norse mythology, in which the god Odin is attacked by the wolf Fenrir. Davidson was well known for her usage of such archaeological evidence for the study of Old Norse religion. From 1968 to 1971, Davidson was a Calouste Gulbenkian Research Fellow at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge. Since 1971 she was Lecturer, and since 1974 Fellow, in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Lucy Cavendish. She was Vice President at Lucy Cavendich from 1975 to 1980. She was deeply involved in the expansion and modernization of Lucy Cavendich. During this time she also published several influential works, including The Viking Road to Byzantium (1976) and The History of the Danes: Saxo Grammaticus (1979-1980). At Cambridge Davidson ran the Cambridge Folklore Group, and was known as an active and lively speaker. Work for The Folklore Society Davidson had joined the The Folklore Society in 1949, and was a member of its Council (later Committee) from 1956 to 1986, subsequently becoming an Honorary Member. As a leading member of the Society, Davidson played an active role in restoring the field of folklore studies as a scientific discipline. She was actively involved in encouraging the modernization and democratization of the Society. Notable friends whom she worked with in this regard include Katharine Briggs and Stewart Sanderson. These efforts culminated in the election of Katharine Briggs as President and Venetia Newall as Secretary of the Society in 1967. In the subsequent fruitful years, Davidson was Publications Officer of the society, supervised the newly formed Mistletoe Books series, organized conferences, and edited or co-edited the papers that were produced as a result. Davidson was herself President of the Society from 1974 to 1976, during which the Society prospered. Its constitution was rewritten, and the output of its journal, Folklore, significantly expanded in both volume and quality. Davidson's efforts to modernize the Society are memorized in her Changes in the Folklore Society, 1949‚Äì1986 (1987), which were published Folklore. Apart from her membership in The Folklore Society, Davidson was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Later career In her later career, Davidson was particularly interested in exploring themes and beliefs common in both early Celtic and Germanic culture. Books produced as a result include Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe (1988), Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe (1993), and Roles of the Northern Goddesses (1998). She received the Coote Lake Medal for Folklore Research in 1984. Davidson helped endow the Katharine Briggs Folklore Award in 1982, which she herself received in 1988 for her Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe (1988). Davidson also dedicated herself to examining the history of folklore studies itself. In this connection, together with Carmen Blacker, Davidson edited Women and Tradition: A Neglected Group of Folklorists (2000). In 1987, Davidson helped found the Katharine Briggs Dining Club. She organized many of its conferences, and edited the papers that were produces as a result, often in cooperation with Blacker and Anna Chaudhri. In 1988 she published a valuable biography of her friend Katherine Briggs. The last of her editorial projects, A Companion to the Fairy Tale (2003), was conducted in cooperation with Chaudhri. Death and legacy Davidson died on 12 January 2006. Her funeral was held in St Bene't's Church in Cambridge on 21 January 2006. She was survived by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. At the time of her death, Davidson had for many decades been highly distinguished scholar in Old Norse religion and mythology.. \\"Dr Hilda Ellis Davidson... [was] for many decades... a distinguished scholar in the field of Scandinavian mythology and religion, whose books reached a wide readership and whose enthusiasm for her subject was an inspiration to many.. \\"Hilda Ellis Davidson... has contributed greatly to the study of Norse mythology.\\" She helped extend both popular and scholarly interest in the fields of Norse, Germanic and Celtic mythology. She played a major role in establishing the study of British folklore as a scientific dicipline. Several of her works were translated into multiple languages, including Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and Japanese. Her efforts to encourage interdisciplinary research combining archaeology, literature, folklore and history was highly important. She was a tutor of a large number of scholars in mythology and folklore, and was particularly devoted to encouraging the scholarly careers of gifted women.. \\"For many a young scholar Hilda has been, if not quite a goddess, then at least a fairy godmother... Hilda Ellis Davidson is the living proof that for a woman to be successful as an academic she does not have to sacrifice other aspects of her identity\\" Personal life On 27 December 1943, she married Richard Robertson Davidson, a research scientist, with whom she had three children. She was a member of the Liberal Party and the Church of England. She was actively involved in church life as a churchwarden and bell- ringer.

They are often credited as one of the \\"Big Four\\" of the German thrash metal scene, the others being Kreator, Sodom and Tankard. In addition to helping pioneer black metal by containing several elements of what was to become the genre, Destruction was part of the second wave of thrash metal in the late 1980s, along with American bands Testament, Sacred Reich, Death Angel and Dark Angel. For most of the 1990s, the band was not signed to a record label and was forced to self-produce their albums until they signed a contract with Nuclear Blast in the early 2000s.  History  Inspired by Iron Maiden, Mercyful Fate, Mot√∂rhead and Venom, Destruction were formed as Knight of Demon in 1982. The original line-up featured guitarist Mike Sifringer, vocalist and bassist Schmier, and drummer Tommy Sandmann. They soon changed their name to Destruction and released a demo titled Bestial Invasion of Hell in 1984. After this the group signed with Steamhammer Records and released an EP titled Sentence of Death later that year. Destruction released their first full- length album titled Infernal Overkill in 1985, followed by Eternal Devastation in 1986. The trio then added a second guitarist, Harry Wilkens, and released the EP Mad Butcher (1987), the full-length album Release from Agony in 1988, then a live recording Live Without Sense in 1989, and Cracked Brain in 1990. In 1989, during the initial recording sessions of Cracked Brain, Schmier was fired from the band, and was replaced by Poltergeist frontman Andr√© Grieder. Mike Sifringer continued to release albums under the moniker of \\"Neo- Destruction\\". In 1999, Schmier rejoined, and things began to look up for the band as they signed a record deal with Nuclear Blast. They then released three more albums: All Hell Breaks Loose in 2000, The Antichrist in 2001, and Metal Discharge in 2003. The band would then sign with AFM Records and release Inventor of Evil in 2005. That album was followed two years later by the compilation of re-recorded songs Thrash Anthems (2007), and then a year later by D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N. (2008). In February 2011, Destruction released Day of Reckoning. A European tour with Overkill was scheduled for March 2011. Headlining dates in South America and North America were being planned for April and May. The band's thirteenth studio album, Spiritual Genocide, was released in November 23, 2012. Their next album, Under Attack, was released on May 13, 2016. Through an exclusive PledgeMusic campaign, Destruction recorded a sequel to Thrash Anthems titled Thrash Anthems II. Like its predecessor, this album is a compilation of more re-recordings of classic songs by the band. The band released a full download of the album through PledgeMusic for free to accompany all purchases of the physical copies of the album on July 18, 2017. The exclusive CDs/Vinyls were shipped in August 2017 and once sold out, Nuclear Blast will release a more widely available version at the end of the year. On January 23, 2018, it was announced that Vaaver had left Destruction \\"for family reasons\\", according to Schmier. He took time off in 2015 to be with his family following the birth of his second child. Drummer Randy Black would temporarily replace him until the band finds a \\"worthy successor\\". He was later announced as the band's new drummer. On February 28, 2019, it was announced that Swiss guitar player Damir Eskic had joined the band. This new lineup recorded Destruction's fifteenth studio album Born to Perish, which was released on August 9, 2019, and a follow-up album is in the works. Born to Perish, released via the record label Nuclear Blast, is rooted in their traditional style of thrash metal and received good reviews.

Hard-coded data typically can only be modified by editing the source code and recompiling the executable, although it can be changed in memory or on disk using a debugger or hex editor. Data that are hard-coded usually represent unchanging pieces of information, such as physical constants, version numbers and static text elements. Softcoded data, on the other hand, encode arbitrary information like user input, HTTP server responses, or configuration files, and are determined at runtime. Overview Hard coding requires the program's source code to be changed any time the input data or desired format changes, when it might be more convenient to the end user to change the detail by some means outside the program. Hard coding is often required, but can also be considered an anti-pattern. Programmers may not have a dynamic user interface solution for the end user worked out but must still deliver the feature or release the program. This is usually temporary but does resolve, in a short term sense, the pressure to deliver the code. Later, softcoding is done to allow a user to pass on parameters that give the end user a way to modify the results or outcome. The term \\"hard- coded\\" was initially used as an analogy to hardwiring circuits - and was meant to convey the inflexibility which results from its usage within software design and implementation. In the context of run-time extensible collaborative development environments such as MUDs, hardcoding also refers to developing the core engine of the system responsible for low-level tasks and executing scripts, as opposed to softcoding which is developing the high-level scripts that get interpreted by the system at runtime. In this case, the term is not pejorative and refers to general development, rather than specifically embedding output data. Hardcoding and backdoors  Hardcoding credentials is a popular way of creating a backdoor. Hardcoded credentials are usually not visible in configuration files or the output of account-enumeration commands and cannot be easily changed or bypassed by users. If discovered, a user might be able to disable such a backdoor by modifying and rebuilding the program from its source code (if source is publicly available or reverse-engineered), directly editing the program's binary code, or instituting an integrity check (such as digital signatures, anti-tamper, and anti-cheat) to prevent the unexpected access, but such actions are often prohibited by a EULA. Hardcoding and DRM As a digital rights management measure, software developers may hardcode a unique serial number directly into a program. Or it is common to hardcode a public key, creating the DRM for which it is infeasible to create a keygen. On the opposite case, a software cracker may hard-code a valid serial number to the program or even prevent the executable from asking the user for it, allowing unauthorized copies to be redistributed without the need of entering a valid number, thus sharing the same key for every copy, if one has been hard-coded.  Fixed installation path  If a Windows program is programmed to assume it is always installed to C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Appname and someone tries to install it to a different drive for space or organizational reasons, it may fail to install or to run after installation. This problem might not be identified in the testing process, since the average user installs to the default drive and directory and testing might not include the option of changing the installation directory. However it is advisable for programmers and developers not to fix the installation path of a program, since the default installation path depends on the operating system, OS version, and sysadmin decisions. For example, many installations of Microsoft Windows use drive C: as their primary hard disk, but this is not guaranteed. There was a similar issue with microprocessors in early computers, which started execution at a fixed address in memory. Startup disk Some \\"copy-protected\\" programs look for a particular file on a floppy disk or flash drive on startup to verify that they are not unauthorized copies. If the computer is replaced by a newer machine, which doesn't have a floppy drive, the program that requires it now can't be run, since the floppy disk can't be inserted. This last example shows why hard- coding may turn out to be impractical even when it seems at the time that it would work completely. In the 1980s and 1990s the great majority of PCs were fitted with at least one floppy drive, but floppy drives later fell out of use. A program hard-coded in that manner 15 years ago could face problems if not updated. Special folders Some Windows operating systems have so called Special Folders which organize files logically on the hard disk. There are problems that can arise involving hard coding: =Profile path= Some Windows programs hard code the profile path to developer-defined locations such as \`C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\Username\`. This is the path for the vast majority of Windows 2000 or above, but this would cause an error if the profile is stored on a network or otherwise relocated. The proper way to get it is to call the \`GetUserProfileDirectory\` function or to resolve the \`%userprofile%\` environment variable. Another assumption that developers often make is assuming that the profile is located on a local hard disk. =My Documents folder path= Some Windows programs hardcode the path to \`My Documents\` as \`ProfilePath\\\\My Documents\`. These programs would work on machines running the English version, but on localized versions of Windows this folder normally has a different name. For example, in Italian versions the \`My Documents\` folder is named Documenti. \`My Documents\` may also have been relocated using Folder Redirection in Group Policy in Windows 2000 or above. The proper way to get it is to call the \`SHGetFolderPath\` function. Solution An indirect reference, such as a variable inside the program called \\"FileName\\", could be expanded by accessing a \\"browse for file\\" dialogue window, and the program code would not have to be changed if the file moved. Hard coding is especially problematic in preparing the software for translation to other languages. In many cases, a single hard-coded value, such as an array size, may appear several times within the source code of a program. This would be a magic number. This may commonly cause a program bug if some of the appearances of the value are modified, but not all of them. Such a bug is hard to find and may remain in the program for a long time. A similar problem may occur if the same hard- coded value is used for more than one parameter value, e.g. an array of 6 elements and a minimum input string length of 6. A programmer may mistakenly change all instances of the value (often using an editor's search-and-replace facility) without checking the code to see how each instance is used. Both situations are avoided by defining constants, which associate names with the values, and using the names of the constants for each appearance within the code. One important case of hard coding is when strings are placed directly into the file, which forces translators to edit the source code to translate a program. (There is a tool called \`gettext\` that permits strings to be left in files, but lets translators translate them without changing the source code; it effectively de-hard codes the strings.) Hard coding in competitions In computing competitions such as the International Olympiad in Informatics, contestants are required to write a program with specific input-output pattern according to the requirement of the questions. In rare cases where the possible number of inputs is small enough, a contestant might consider using an approach that maps all possible inputs to their correct outputs. This program would be considered a hard-coded solution as opposed to an algorithmic one (even though the hard-coded program might be the output of an algorithmic program).

During her decades as a dissident, Bonner was noted for her characteristic blunt honesty and courage. Biography =Early life and education= Bonner was born Lusik Georgievna AlikhanovaYelena Bonner biography (In Russian) in Merv, Turkmen SSR, USSR (now Mary, Turkmenistan). Her father, Georgy Alikhanov (Armenian name Gevork Alikhanyan), Official site of Moscow Helsinki Group (In Russian) was an Armenian who founded the Soviet Armenian Communist Party, and was a highly placed member of the Comintern; her mother, Ruf (Ruth Bonner), was a Jewish Communist activist. She had a younger brother, Igor, who became a career naval officer. Her family had a summer dacha in Sestroretsk and Bonner had fond memories there. In 1937, Bonner's father was arrested by the NKVD and executed as part of Stalin's Great Purge; her mother was arrested a few days later as the wife of an enemy of the people, and served ten years in the Gulag near Karaganda, Kazakhstan, followed by nine years of internal exile. Bonner's 41-year-old maternal uncle, Matvei Bonner, was also executed during the purge, and his wife internally exiled. All four were exonerated (rehabilitated) following Stalin's death in 1953. In 1941 she volunteered for the Red Army's Hospital when the Soviet Union was invaded, and she became head nurse. While serving during World War II, Bonner was wounded twice, and in 1946 was honorably discharged as a disabled veteran. In 1947 Bonner was accepted as student in the medical institute in Leningrad. After the war she earned a degree in pediatrics from the First Leningrad Medical Institute, presently First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg. =Marriage and children= In medical school she met her first husband, Ivan Semyonov. They had a daughter, Tatiana, in 1950, and a son, Alexey, in 1956. Her children emigrated to the United States in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Bonner and Semyonov separated in 1965, and eventually divorced. In October 1970, while attending the trial of human rights activists Revol't (Ivanovich) Pimenov and Boris Vail in Kaluga, Bonner met Andrei Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and human rights activist; they married in 1972. The year before they met, 1969, Sakharov had been widowed from his wife, Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he had two daughters and a son.Drell, Sidney D., and Sergei P. Kapitsa (eds.), Sakharov Remembered, pgs. 3, 92. New York: Springer, 1991. =Activism= Beginning as early as the 1940s, Bonner had helped political prisoners and their families. Although Bonner had joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1964 while she was working as a physician, only a few years later she was becoming active in the Soviet human rights movement. Her resolve towards dissidence was strengthened in August 1968 after Soviet bloc tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia in order to crush the Prague Spring movement. That event strengthened her belief that the system could not be reformed from within. At the Kaluga trial in 1970, Bonner and Sakharov met Natan Sharansky and began working together to defend Jews sentenced to death for attempting an escape from the USSR in a hijacked plane. Under pressure from Sakharov, the Soviet regime permitted Yelena Bonner to travel to the West in 1975, 1977 and 1979 for treatment of her wartime eye injury. When Sakharov, awarded the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, was barred from travel by the Soviet authorities, Bonner, in Italy for treatment, represented him at the ceremony in Oslo. Bonner became a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976. When in January 1980 Sakharov was exiled to Gorky, a city closed to foreigners, the harassed and publicly denounced Bonner became his lifeline, traveling between Gorky and Moscow to bring out his writings. Her arrest in April 1984 for \\"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\\" and sentence to five years of exile in Gorky disrupted their lives again. Sakharov's several long and painful hunger strikes forced the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev to let her travel to the U.S. in 1985 for sextuple bypass heart surgery. Prior to that, in 1981, Bonner and Sakharov went on a dangerous but ultimately successful hunger strike to get Soviet officials to allow their daughter-in- law, Yelizaveta Konstantinovna (\\"Lisa\\") Alexeyeva, an exit visa to join her husband, Bonner's son Alexei Semyonov, in the United States. In December 1986, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and Bonner to return to Moscow. Following Sakharov's death on 14 December 1989, she established the Andrei Sakharov Foundation, and the Sakharov Archives in Moscow. In 1993, she donated Sakharov papers in the West to Brandeis University in the U.S.; in 2004 they were turned over to Harvard University. Bonner remained outspoken on democracy and human rights in Russia and worldwide. She joined the defenders of the Russian parliament during the August Coup and supported Boris Yeltsin during the constitutional crisis in early 1993. In 1994, outraged by what she called \\"genocide of the Chechen people\\", Bonner resigned from Yeltsin's Human Rights Commission and was an outspoken opponent to Russian armed involvement in Chechnya and critical of the Kremlin for allegedly returning to KGB-style authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin. She was also critical of the international \\"quartet\\" two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and has expressed fears about the rise of anti-semitism in Europe.\\"On Israel and The World\\" , Address by Bonner at the Freedom Forum in Oslo. In 1999, Yelena Bonner received the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom. Bonner was among the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto \\"Putin must go\\", published 10 March 2010. Her signature was the first. =Last years and death= From 2006, Bonner divided her time between Moscow and the United States, home to her two children, five grandchildren, one great-granddaughter, and one great-grandson. She died on 18 June 2011 of heart failure in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 88, according to her daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich. She had been hospitalized since 21 February. Works and awards Bonner was the author of Alone Together (Knopf 1987), and Mothers and Daughters (Knopf 1992), and wrote frequently on Russia and human rights. She was a recipient of many international human rights awards, including the Rafto Prize in 1991, the European Parliament's Robert Schuman Medal in 2001, the awards of International Humanist and Ethical Union, the World Women's Alliance, the Adelaida Ristori Foundation, the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, the Lithuanian Commemorative Medal of 13 January, the Czech Republic Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, and others. She was also awarded the Giuseppe Motta Medal in 2004 for protection of human rights.http://motta.gidd.eu.org/#!medal- winners-2004/cqa4 Giuseppe Motta Medal Website In 2005 Bonner participated in \\"They Chose Freedom\\", a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement. Bonner was on the Board of Advancing Human Rights (NGO).Robert Bernstein \\"Why We Need A New Human Rights Organization\\", 24 February 2011. Depiction in media Bonner was portrayed by Glenda Jackson in the 1984 film Sakharov.

Course The Snohomish River forms at the confluence of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers just west of Monroe. Both of these rivers originate in the Cascades and drain the west slopes of the mountains in southeastern Snohomish County and northeastern King County. The Snohomish River flows generally northwestward from the confluence, passing under state route 522 and flowing alongside Lord Hill Park before reaching downtown Snohomish. Here, it is joined by the Pilchuck River, its main tributary, and flows under state route 9. From Snohomish, the river continues northwestward through a broad floodplain, forming the eastern boundary of the city of Everett. The final few miles of the river in Everett form the Snohomish River estuary, a river delta that features wetlands and tideflats spread out across various islands and arms of the river.

Depending upon which layers of the structure are involved, diverticula are described as being either true or false. In medicine, the term usually implies the structure is not normally present. However, in embryology the term is used for some normal structures arising from others, as for instance the thyroid diverticulum, which arises from the tongue. The word comes from Latin dƒ´verticulum, \\"bypath\\" or \\"byway.\\" Classification Diverticula are described as being true or false depending upon the layers involved: *True diverticula involve all layers of the structure, including muscularis propria and adventitia, such as Meckel's diverticulum. *False diverticula (also known as \\"pseudodiverticula\\") do not involve muscular layers or adventitia. False diverticula, in the gastrointestinal tract for instance, involve only the submucosa and mucosa. Embryological *The kidneys, originally diverticula in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. *The lungs, originally diverticula forming off of the ventral foregut. *The thymus appears in the form of two flask-shape diverticula, which arise from the third branchial pouch (pharyngeal pouch) of the endoderm. *The thyroid gland develops as a diverticulum arising from a point on the tongue, demarcated as the foramen cecum. The 3 classifications of esophageal diverticula. 1-Pharyngeal (Zenker's) 2-Midesophageal 3-Epiphrenic Human pathology = Gastrointestinal tract diverticula = *Meckel's diverticulum: a persistent portion of the omphalomesenteric duct present in 2% of the population, making it the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation. *Esophageal diverticula may occur in one of three areas of the esophagus: *#Pharyngeal (Zenker's)- usually occurring in the elderly, through Killian's triangle above the cricopharyngeal muscle. *#Midesophageal *#Epiphrenic-due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, as in achalasia. *Killian-Jamieson diverticulum- is very similar to a pharyngeal esophageal diverticulum, differing in the fact that the pouching is below the cricopharyngeal muscle. *Colonic diverticula: Although found incidentally during colonoscopy, these diverticula may become infected (see diverticulitis) and can perforate, requiring surgery. *Duodenal divertiula: Such condition can be found incidentally in 23% of the normal people underwent imaging. It can be either congenital or acquired but the acquired form is more common. It is due to the weakness of the duodenal wall which causes protusions. It is usually found at the 2nd or 3rd part of duodenum, around the Ampulla of Vater. Food debris may enter the diverticula outpouchings, causing inflammation or diverticulitis. On CT or MRI imaging, they appear as sac-like outpouchings. If the diverticula are filled with contrast agents, the wall would be thin, which may contain air, fluid, contrast material or food debris. If the food debris is broken down by bacteria, the outpouchings may show \\"faeces sign\\". Inflammation of the duodenal wall will show thickening of the wall. Rarely, on barium studies in congenital duodenal diverticula, the contrast material fill-up the true lumen, causing \\"windsock deformity. *Jejunal diverticul(uma): are congenital lesions and may be a source of bacterial overgrowth. They may also perforate or result in abscesses. *Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are diverticula in the gallbladder due to chronic cholecystitis *Gastric diverticula are very infrequent. Most of these pathological types of diverticulum are capable of harboring an enterolith. If the enterolith stays in place, it may cause no problems, but a large enterolith expelled from a diverticulum into the lumen can cause obstruction. = Genito-urinary tract diverticula = *Calyceal diverticulum: usually asymptomatic, but if a stone becomes lodged in the outpouching they may present with pain. *Bladder diverticulum: Balloon-like growths on the bladder commonly associated with a chronic outflow obstruction, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia in older males. Usually found in pairs on opposite sides of the bladder, bladder diverticula are often surgically removed to prevent infection, rupture, or even cancer. *Urethral diverticulum: Urethral diverticula are usually found in women aged 30 to 70 years old, between 1% to 6% of adult women. Since majority of cases are without any symptoms, the true incidence is unknown. Symptoms may vary from frequent urinary tract infections, painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), or symptoms due to cancer. Urethral diverticulum is located on the anterior vaginal wall, 1 to 3 cm inside the vaginal introitus. MRI is preferred as the imaging of choice due to its excellent soft-tissue resolution. On T2 weighted imaging, it will show high signal in the diverticulum due to the presence of fluid inside it. Vaginal ultrasonography is highly sensitive in diagnosing the diverticulum but it is strongly dependent on the skills of the operator. = Other diverticula = *Cardiac diverticulum: A very rare congenital malformation of the heart that is usually benign *Diverticulum of Kommerell: is an out- pouching(aneurysm) of the aorta where an aberrant right subclavian artery is located.

A fugitive from the United States, he murdered PC Ian Broadhurst and attempted to murder PCs Neil Roper and James Banks on 26 December 2003 in Leeds, England, sparking a nationwide search before he was captured. He was given a whole life sentence after being found guilty of murder in December 2004 and the trial judge recommended that he should never be released, however, in 2008 this sentence was reduced to a minimum term of 37 years by the court of appeal, after which he could apply for parole. The Florida shootings Bieber is originally from Fort Myers, Florida, the son of a middle school principal. After leaving school, he was briefly a US Marine before being discharged for going AWOL. Bieber became a drug dealer and bodybuilder. On February 9, 1995 a fellow bodybuilder, Markus Mueller, was shot in Fort Myers. Police arrested Bieber, thinking he had hired a hitman, but later released him due to lack of evidence. In November 1995, Bieber's former girlfriend Michelle Marsh was attacked by the same gunman who had attacked Mueller. All four shots missed. Bieber fled the state, assuming the identity of Nathan Wayne Coleman through stealing the identity of a child who had died in 1975, and escaped the country in 1996.Real Crime: Killer on the Run ITV UK documentary The Leeds police shootings Bieber entered the United Kingdom on September 26, 1996 through the port of Ramsgate, Kent using the false passport. He was given a six-month visa, but it was extended until his marriage to Denise Horsley in Kendal, Cumbria in March 1997. In 1998, Bieber arrived in Yorkshire, where he worked as a nightclub doorman. He also acquired an arsenal of illegal firearms. In 2001 his wife petitioned for divorce and a decree absolute was granted on May 5, 2002. On December 26, 2003, on the border between the Gipton and Oakwood areas of Leeds, unarmed traffic policemen Ian Broadhurst and Neil Roper saw Bieber's stolen BMW car parked at the junction of Grange Park Avenue and Dib Lane, where Bieber had just been into the adjacent post office. They identified the number plates as false, and asked him to accompany them to the police car, where Bieber sat in the back seat. The officers did not attempt to frisk him or handcuff him. They became uneasy, however, and so called for backup, which they received from colleague James Banks. Roper then moved to handcuff Bieber, who, facing imprisonment for various offences in the UK and possible extradition to Florida, drew a 9 mm handgun and fired an initial four shots at the unarmed officers, who tried to flee. Roper was hit twice in the shoulder and abdomen, but managed to get away. Broadhurst was shot once in the back and immobilized. Banks escaped injury after a bullet hit his radio. Bieber walked over to where Broadhurst was lying, and fired a fifth shot into his head at point blank range. It was the first fatal shooting of an English police officer for over eight years ‚Äì preceded by that of PC Philip Walter of the Metropolitan Police, who was shot dead on 18 April 1995. After the shootings, Bieber escaped down Dib Lane, and stole a car at gunpoint outside a betting shop further down the road. This caused some confusion in initial news reports of the shootings, which state that the shooting itself happened outside the betting shop. Nationwide search Following the shootings West Yorkshire Police launched a nationwide search for Bieber led by Detective Chief Supt Chris Gregg. On December 27, 2003 Bieber took a taxi journey in Bradford, and on December 28, armed police raided Bieber's apartment in Leeds. Bieber was arrested by armed police at the Royal Hotel in Dunston, Gateshead at 2.25am on December 31. He had dyed his hair ginger. Under his bed, he had a loaded pistol which was later determined to be the weapon used in the shooting, along with around 300 rounds of ammunition. The next day, he was charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder. Trial The trial was held at Newcastle Crown Court and ended on 2 December 2004. Bieber denied murder, two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and possession of two hundred 9 mm pistol rounds found in a storage shed. Bieber admitted possession of 298 9mm rounds, found when arrested, without a firearms certificate. The prosecution presented evidence from witnesses, identification of Bieber's voice and DNA evidence. Bieber's defence was that the culprit was his friend who looked like him, also from Florida, that committed the offences and had asked him to look after the murder weapon. Bieber said he could not name this friend for fear of reprisals. Bieber was convicted on one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. The judge, Mr Justice Moses, told Bieber he had shown \\"no remorse or understanding of the brutality\\" of his crime, and the aggravating feature in the case was that Bieber did not need to shoot Broadhurst through the head, noting: Bieber was given three life sentences. The judge recommended that Bieber should never be released, making him only the 25th person in British legal history to be recommended for lifelong imprisonment. It was the first time such a recommendation had been made since the Home Secretary lost his power to set minimum terms. Should he be released, the State of Florida, where he faces charges relating to the murder of Markus Mueller and the attempted murder of former girlfriend Michelle Marsh in 1995,Casefile on America's Most Wanted has said it would seek his extradition, though he would not be subject to the death penalty due to extradition treaties. Appeals On 24 October 2006, the Appeal Court rejected a bid from Bieber for his convictions to be overturned, but ruled he could appeal against the trial judge's recommendation that he should never be released. In February 2007, it was announced that Bieber's sentence appeal would be delayed due to a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) review on whether lifelong imprisonment is a violation of human rights. In January 2012, the ECHR, by a 4-3 majority, held there was no such violation. Later in 2007, it was reported that Bieber was involved in an escape plot with two other prisoners, which was foiled. On July 23, 2008, Bieber was told by the High Court that he would not have to serve a whole life term, as originally recommended by the trial judge, but would still have to serve a minimum of 37 years before being considered for parole, meaning he is set to remain in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 75 years old. His appeal was successful on the basis that the sentence amounted to 'inhuman treatment', which Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, described as \\"[leaving] the judiciary with blood on its hands\\".

Their radio callsign is Gypsy and their tail code is AC. Their mission is: \\"Strike Fighter Squadron 32, as a part of United States Naval Aviation, utilizes the F/A-18F aircraft to project power ashore and at sea, to defend the Fleet against air and sea threats and to carry out all other missions which may be assigned by cognizant authority.\\"  Insignia and nickname  Early VBF-3 insignia Early VF-32 insignia Originally, the squadron used the Fighting Three Felix the Cat symbol and called themselves the \\"Crazy Cats\\" because so many pilots were from Fighting Three. At one time, the squadron was known as the \\"White Lightning.\\" In 1950, the squadron adopted the insignia of a traditional heraldry lion under Naval Aviation wings of gold and the motto \\"Deus et Patria\\" that has endured with only slight modernization through today. The VF-32 squadron radio callsign is \\"Gypsy\\" and most alumni refer to themselves as \\"Gypsies\\". The squadron picked up the nickname Swordsmen after it switched to the F-8 Crusader and added a sword to the lion's hand.  History  = 1940s = VFA-32 was established as Bombing Fighting Three (VBF-3) on February 1, 1945, flying the F6F Hellcat, when it was split off from VF-3, the famed Felix squadron. Fritz Wolf, a former member of the American Volunteer Group (AVG) or Flying Tigers, was assigned as the first VBF-3 commanding officer. At the time, U.S. Navy carriers were closing on the Japanese home islands and were facing aggressive Kamikaze attacks. VBF-3 was assigned to Carrier Air Group THREE on board in the Pacific theater. On 16 February 1945, VBF-3 pilots became the Navy's first carrier-based pilots to strike the Japanese islands. During the heavy action on that day, the squadron shot down 24 Japanese aircraft, earning the Presidential Unit Citation. On 15 November 1946, VBF-3 was redesignated VF-4A and switched to the F8F-1 Bearcat. On 7 August 1948, VF-4A became VF-32 and switched to the F4U Corsair. = 1950s = F9F-6s during the world cruise of in 1954. In 1950, the squadron were deployed to the Korean War with F4Us aboard . From October 1950 to January 1951, VF-32 hit Korean targets including Wonsan Harbor, Puckchong, Chonjin, and Chosin Reservoir. On 4 December 1950, the aircraft of Ensign Jesse L. Brown, the first Black American Naval Aviator, was hit by flak while supporting embattled Marines at Chosin. He crash-landed his Corsair behind enemy lines on a snow- covered mountain slope. His wingman, Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., could see that Brown survived the forced landing, but appeared to be trapped in the cockpit with smoke coming from the engine compartment. In an attempt to save his squadron mate, Hudner crash-landed his plane alongside Browns'. Hudner found Brown semi-conscious, but was unable to extricate him from the crumpled fuselage. Brown died in Hudner's arms, and although the attempted rescue failed, Hudner received the Medal of Honor and Brown received the Distinguished Flying Cross. F8U-1 in 1958 In November 1952 the squadron returned to the East Coast and became the first squadron to operate the swept- wing F9F-6 Cougar. VF-32 made subsequent deployments aboard in 1953 and the in 1955. In 1956, VF-32 became the first squadron to transition to the F8U-1 Crusader, thus becoming the first supersonic squadron in the Navy. While deployed aboard as a unit of Carrier Air Group THREE, VF-32 participated in the 1958 Lebanon crisis. = 1960s = F-4B in 1971 During the Cuban Missile Crisis in late 1962, VF-32 flew 96 sorties to support photo-reconnaissance flights and intelligence-gathering missions. After returning from cruise in 1965, the squadron changed homeport from NAS Cecil Field, Florida to NAS Oceana, Virginia, and switched to the F-4B Phantom II. VF-32 detached from Carrier Air Group THREE, ending a relationship that had lasted since the squadron's establishment. In June 1966, VF-32 embarked aboard as a component of Carrier Air Group ONE and sailed for Yankee Station in Southeast Asia. The squadron flew 940 combat sorties during three line periods in five months, building a highly successful Vietnam War combat record, losing no aircraft or aircrew. In May 1968, VF-32 deployed aboard for her maiden voyage. = 1970s = VF-32 F-14As in 1974 For service in October 1970, the squadron received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for actions in support of the United States Sixth Fleet operations during the Middle East Crisis. In 1974, VF-32 switched to the F-14 Tomcat at NAS Miramar before moving to NAS Oceana as one of the first fleet Tomcat squadrons based there. VF-32 made the first Atlantic Fleet F-14 deployment in June 1975. On that cruise, VF-32 was awarded the Joseph Clifton Award as the Navy's top fighter squadron. In October 1977, VF-32 became the first fleet squadron to fly against the Air Force F-15 Eagle, setting the stage for regularly scheduled dissimilar air combat training between the Air Force and Navy. VF-32 again embarked for the Mediterranean aboard Kennedy in June 1978. During this deployment, VF-32 conducted the first fleet test and evaluation of the new Television Camera System. The squadron also deployed with AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles for the first fleet captive- carry evaluation. A mid-cruise missile exercise, \\"BUZZARDEX\\", saw firings of AIM-54 Phoenix and AIM-7 Sparrow missiles at five targets moving at Mach 2.5. In October 1979, VF-32 completed 10 years of accident-free flying. In those 10 years, the squadron flew over 33,000 hours, including 17,000 in the F-14A. = 1980s = In 1980, the squadron was again presented with the Admiral Clifton Award. In 1980 and 1981, the squadron achieved an accident-free Mediterranean deployment aboard Kennedy, followed in 1982 by another accident-free Med cruise aboard and the 1982 Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet Battle \\"E\\" and CNO Safety \\"S\\" awards. In 1982, three VF-32 Tomcats tail numbers 211, 212 and 214, were modified to carry the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System TARPS pod. In 1983‚Äì84, the squadron completed the Navy's first combat deployment since the Vietnam era with CVW-6 aboard Independence. VF-32 flew combat air patrol missions and provided TARPS imagery for the 4 December 1983 CVW-6/CVW-3 air strikes on Syrian positions in Lebanon. VF-32 also flew missions in support of Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada providing pre- and post-battle damage assessment using photography from the TARPS pod. The deployment concluded with participation in NATO exercise \\"TEAMWORK 84\\" in the Norwegian Sea. The squadron made a third deployment aboard Independence from October 1984 through February 1985 to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. Special patch from 1988‚Äì89 deployment The squadron rejoined CVW-3 in February 1985, and embarked aboard John F. Kennedy in August 1986 for another Mediterranean deployment. This cruise saw the squadron's Class \\"A\\" safety record extended another year, but also included the first night F-14 barricade landing. VF-32 participated in a variety of NATO and combined exercises, and extended their major mishap-free safety record to nine years during a 1988‚Äì89 Mediterranean deployment, again aboard John F. Kennedy. On January 4, 1989, while flying from John F. Kennedy during a routine patrol over the Gulf of Sidra, two VF-32 F-14s intercepted two Libyan MiG-23 Floggers, which had originated from the Al Bumbai airfield in Tobruk. After attempting a peaceful intercept, the F-14s used their Television Camera System (TCS) to verify that the MiGs were armed. Hostile intent was declared and the aircraft were cleared to engage. The lead fired an AIM-7 Sparrow, which failed to track. His wingman also fired an AIM-7, which tracked and destroyed one of the MiGs, its pilot ejecting. The first F-14 then closed to AIM-9 Sidewinder range and downed the remaining MiG-23, whose pilot also ejected. The squadron returned to Virginia in February 1989. VFA-32 appeared on an episode of CBS News 48 Hours entitled \\"Super Carrier - USS Kennedy.\\" = 1990s = USAF KC-135 When Kuwait was invaded by Iraqi forces in August 1990, VF-32 joined Carrier Air Wing 3, was put on emergency recall from Nellis AFB and returned to NAS Oceana to prepare to sortie with Kennedy. Kennedy immediately proceeded to the Red Sea to participate in Operation Desert Shield alongside . During Desert Shield, the ship made several Suez Canal transits and operated in the Eastern Mediterranean. When Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm in January 1991, VF-32 Tomcats were in the first strike wave flying Combat Air Patrol mainly in central and western Iraq. VF-32 TARPS aircrews flew daily missions throughout Iraq including supersonic runs over highly defended Al Qa'im. Throughout Operation Desert Storm, VF-32 aircrew logged 1,445 combat flight hours on 403 missions, including 38 combat TARPS missions. After an eight-month deployment, the squadron returned to NAS Oceana on 28 March 1991. Later that year, the squadron won the 1991 AIRLANT Grand Slam missile firing competition with 17 of 17 scored kills. VF-32 and John F. Kennedy again deployed in October 1992. The squadron conducted a great deal of air-to-ground operations in the Adriatic Sea while on cruise in support of Operation Provide Promise, marking the beginning of the Tomcat strike/fighter mission and provided significant carrier air patrol support for C-130 food drop missions in the former Yugoslavia. The squadron returned home to NAS Oceana in April 1993 and throughout the summer conducted joint exercises with the Air Force and was coined the first \\"Toms to Bomb\\" squadron to fully certify the use of bombs on the F-14 platform. The year was highlighted with presentations of the Battle \\"E\\" and Clifton Awards to VF-32. In May 1994, VF-32 and CVW-3 embarked aboard . This four-week deployment marked the first extensive at-sea period where women worked alongside men on a fleet aircraft carrier. In September, a small detachment provided TARPS photography and air support for Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti. In November 1994, VF-32 deployed aboard Dwight D. Eisenhower for another tour in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The squadron flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Deny Flight. 1995 marked fifty years of service from the men and women of VF-32. In November 1996, VF-32 and CVW-3 deployed on board for another tour in support of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Southern Watch over Bosnia and Iraq. The squadron brought digital imagery to the TARPS mission through new cameras that could take up to two hundred digital images and was able to store them on board or transmit them to appropriately equipped ground or sea-based receivers up to 300 kilometers away, resulting in a near-real-time reconnaissance capability. The squadron received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its cutting edge work with Digital TARPS. In August 1997, VF-32 began transitioning from the F-14A to F-14B. In February 1998, the squadron received the F-14B Upgrade. Sister squadrons VF-14 and VF-32 operating from In November 1998, VF-32 and CVW-3 deployed aboard to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea to support Operation Southern Watch and Operation Deliberate Force. With Iraq‚Äôs failure to cooperate with United Nations inspections of known weapon sites, Operation Desert Fox was launched on December 16, 1998. VF-32 took part in a 33-aircraft strike package on December 16. The first night of the four- day operation was conducted by the US Navy only. Over four days, VF-32 expended of ordnance during 16 strike missions and 38 sorties. During Desert Fox many Tomcat firsts were achieved, including the first GBU-24s dropped in combat by the US Navy, the first multiple GBU-24 drop by any platform in combat, the first combat use of the LANTIRN, the first autonomous F-14 delivery of a GBU-10/16/24, and the first F-14 use of Night Vision Devices in combat. The squadron returned home in May 1999. = 2000s = VF-32 F-14 tail markings VF-32 deployed once again in November 2000 for the maiden voyage of the . They spent four months in support of Operation Southern Watch and returned home on May 23, 2001. In December 2002 VF-32 deployed once again on Harry S. Truman in support of Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Northern Watch. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in 2003, VF-32 was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea aboard Harry S. Truman. VF-32 flew strike missions and missions in support of US Special Forces on the ground. VF-32 was involved in the worst friendly fire incident of the war when on 6 April 2003 a squadron F-14 crew was cleared to attack an Iraqi tank near Dibakan, south east of Mosul. Instead, they mistakenly dropped a single laser-guided bomb on a vehicle convoy consisting of US Special Forces and Kurdish resistance fighters, killing 18 Kurdish fighters, 4 US soldiers and a BBC translator. An additional 80 people were wounded. An investigation following the war found that the pilot had been cleared to drop without the benefit of target coordinates provided by the Forward Air Controller, who was ‚Äúoperating under great stress‚Äù at the time. Overall, VF-32 flew 275 sorties and expended 247 laser-guided bombs and 118 JDAM. In January 2004 VF-32 became the first operational squadron to attempt the launch of six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles from one aircraft. A launch such as this had not been attempted since 1972. Five of the six active radar missiles were successfully launched. VF-32 returned to NAS Oceana in May 2003. VFA-32 now operates the F/A-18F Super Hornet. In 2004 VF-32 deployed again in support of OIF, becoming the first Naval squadron to redeploy in support of OIF. The squadron delivered multiple precision guided munitions on insurgent hideouts using the LANTIRN pod in the urban Close Air Support environment. This would be the squadron's final deployment with the F-14. In October 2005, VF-32 transitioned to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and in November 2005 the squadron was designated Strike Fighter Squadron Thirty Two (VFA-32). In November 2007, VFA-32 embarked on USS Harry S. Truman for their first F/A-18F Super Hornet cruise, deploying to the Persian Gulf.‚Äì Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group Deploys VFA-32 and the rest of CVW-3 returned home on June 4, 2008.

During and after the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, conservative Southern Democrats were part of the coalition generally in support of Roosevelt's New Deal and Harry Truman's Fair Deal economic policies, but were opposed to desegregation and the American civil rights movement. On several occasions between 1948 and 1968, prominent conservative Southern Democrats broke from the Democrats to run a third party campaign for President on a platform of states' rights: Strom Thurmond in 1948, Harry F. Byrd in 1960, and George Wallace in 1968. In the 1964 presidential election, five states in the Deep South (then a Democratic stronghold) voted for Republican Barry Goldwater over Southern Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, partly due to Johnson's support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Goldwater's opposition to it. After 1968, with desegregation a settled issue, the Republican Party began a strategy of trying to win conservative Southerners away from the Democrats and into the Republican Party (see Southern strategy and silent majority). Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia took up the boll weevil as a symbol in the 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, but the term did not gain currency until the 1980s, when it was revived by Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas. The group adopted the name of the boll weevil, a pest destructive to cotton crops, because of the difficulty of eradicating the weevil and the pest's Southern habitat.\\"Boll Weevils\\" in Elections A-Z (ed. John L. Moore: Congressional Quarterly, 1999). Routledge ed. 2013. pp. 27-28. Nonetheless, a bloc of conservative Democrats, mostly Southerners, remained in the United States Congress throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These included Democratic House members as conservative as Larry McDonald, who was also a leader in the John Birch Society. During the administration of Ronald Reagan, the term \\"boll weevils\\" was applied to this bloc of conservative Democrats, who consistently voted for Reagan administration policies, such as tax cuts, increases in military spending, and deregulation. The boll weevils were contrasted with the \\"gypsy moth Republicans\\"‚Äîmoderate Republicans from the Northeast and Midwest who opposed many of Reagan's economic policies. Most of the boll weevils eventually retired from politics, or in the case of some, such as Senators Phil Gramm and Richard Shelby, switched parties and joined the Republicans. Since 1988, the term \\"boll weevils\\" has fallen out of favor. A bloc of conservative Democrats in the House, including some younger or newer members as well as the remaining boll weevils who refused to bow to pressure to switch parties, organized themselves as the \\"Blue Dogs\\" in the early 1990s. A different bloc of Democrats also emerged in the 1990s, under the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), espousing pro-business views on economic issues and moderate views on social issues.

In spite of their appearance, these animals are not true dormice, but are part of the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. The platacanthomyids can be distinguished from the true dormice, because they have no premolars, giving them three cheek teeth, like their relatives, the Muroidea. The evolutionary relationship of the Platacanthomyidae was uncertain until a molecular phylogenetic study found it to be the earliest extant lineage to branch within the superfamily Muroidea. They can be distinguished from both the family Spalacidae and the Eumuroida (all non-spalacid and non-platacanthomyid muroids), by the distinct shape of their infraorbital canal and by the presence of multiple openings in the palate of the skull.

It is one of the three formes fixes (the others were the ballade and the rondeau) and was one of the most common verse forms set to music in Europe from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries. One of the most famous composers of virelai is Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377), who also wrote his own verse; 33 separate compositions in the form survive by him. Other composers of virelai include Jehannot de l'Escurel, one of the earliest (d. 1304), and Guillaume Dufay (c. 1400-1474), one of the latest. By the mid-15th century, the form had become largely divorced from music, and numerous examples of this form (including the ballade and the rondeau) were written, which were either not intended to be set to music, or for which the music has not survived. A virelai with only a single stanza is also known as a bergerette.  Musical virelai  Structural schema of the virelai. The virelai as a song form of the 14th and early 15th century usually has three stanzas, and a refrain that is stated before the first stanza and again after each. Within each stanza, the structure is that of the bar form, with two sections that share the same rhymes and music (Stollen), followed by a third (Abgesang). The third section of each stanza shares its rhymes and music with the refrain. Thus, it can be schematically represented as AbbaA, where \\"A\\" represents the repeated refrain, \\"a\\" represents the verse set to the same music as the refrain, and \\"b\\" represents the remaining verses set to different music. Within this overall structure, the number of lines and the rhyme scheme is variable. The refrain and Abgesang may be of three, four or five lines each, with rhyme schemes such as ABA, ABAB, AAAB, ABBA, or AABBA. The structure often involves an alternation of longer with shorter lines. Typically, all three stanzas share the same set of rhymes, which means that the entire poem may be built on just two rhymes, if the Stollen sections also share their rhymes with the refrain. thumbright400px \\"Douce Dame Jolie\\" by Guillaume de Machaut is an example of a virelai with rhymes \\"AAAB\\" in the refrain, and \\"aab\\" (with a shortened second verse) in each of the stollen sections. : : : : :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: : : : :  Virelai \\"ancien\\" and \\"nouveau\\"  From the 15th century onwards the virelai was no longer regularly set to music but became a purely literary form, and its structural variety proliferated. The 17th-century prosodist P√®re Mourgues defined what he called the virelai ancien in a way that has little in common with the musical virelais of the 14th and 15th centuries. His virelai ancien is a structure without a refrain and with an interlocking rhyme scheme between the stanzas: in the first stanza, the rhymes are AAB AAB AAB, with the B lines shorter than the A lines. In the second stanza, the B rhymes are shifted to the longer verses, and a new C rhyme is introduced for the shorter ones (BBC BBC BBC), and so on. Another form described by P√®re Mourgues is the virelai nouveau, which has a two-line refrain at the beginning, with each stanza ending with a repetition of either the first or the second refrain verse in alternation, and the last stanza ending in both refrain verses in reversed order. These forms have occasionally been reproduced in later English poetry, e.g. by John Payne (\\"Spring Sadness\\", a virelai ancien), and Henry Austin Dobson (\\"July\\", a virelai nouveau).

He is regarded as a key figure in transition from the Russian neoclassicism to romanticism.  Biography  Karl Bryullov was born on December, 12th (23), 1799 in St. Petersburg, in the family of the academician, woodcarver, and engraver Pavel Ivanovich Briullo (Brulleau, 1760‚Äî1833) who was of Huguenot descent. He felt drawn to Italy from his early years. Despite his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1809‚Äì1821), Bryullov never fully embraced the classical style taught by his mentors and promoted by his brother, Alexander Bryullov. After distinguishing himself as a promising and imaginative student and finishing his education, he left Russia for Rome where he worked until 1835 as a portraitist and genre painter, though his fame as an artist came when he began doing historical painting. His best-known work, The Last Day of Pompeii (1830‚Äì1833), is a vast composition compared by Pushkin and Gogol to the best works of Rubens and Van Dyck. It created a sensation in Italy and established Bryullov as one of the finest European painters of his day. After completing this work, he triumphantly returned to the Russian capital, where he made many friends among the aristocracy and intellectual elite and obtained a high post in the Imperial Academy of Arts. An anecdote concerning Bryullov appeared in Leo Tolstoy's essay \\"Why Do Men Stupefy Themselves?\\" and later in the same author's book What Is Art?. While teaching at the academy (1836‚Äì1848) he developed a portrait style which combined a neoclassical simplicity with a romantic tendency that fused well, and his penchant for realism was satisfied with an intriguing level of psychological penetration. While he was working on the plafond of St Isaac's Cathedral, his health suddenly deteriorated. Following advice of his doctors, Bryullov left Russia for Madeira in 1849 and spent the last three years of his life in Italy. He died in the village of Manziana near Rome and is buried at the Cimitero Acattolico there.

L. Mencken's book about the English language as spoken in the United States. Origins and concept Mencken was inspired by \\"the argot of the colored waiters\\" in Washington, as well as one of his favorite authors, Mark Twain, and his experiences on the streets of Baltimore. In 1902, Mencken remarked on the \\"queer words which go into the making of 'United States.'\\" The book was preceded by several columns in The Evening Sun. Mencken eventually asked \\"Why doesn't some painstaking pundit attempt a grammar of the American language... English, that is, as spoken by the great masses of the plain people of this fair land?\\" In the tradition of Noah Webster, who wrote the first American dictionary, Mencken wanted to defend \\"Americanisms\\" against a steady stream of English critics, who usually isolated Americanisms as borderline \\"perversions\\" of the \\"mother tongue\\". Mencken assaulted the prescriptive grammar of these critics and American \\"schoolmarms\\", arguing, like Samuel Johnson in the preface to his dictionary, that language evolves independently of textbooks. The book discusses the beginnings of \\"American\\" variations from \\"English\\", the spread of these variations, American names and slang over the course of its 374 pages. According to Mencken, American English was more colourful, vivid, and creative than its British counterpart. The book sold exceptionally well by Mencken's standards‚Äî1400 copies in the first two months. The book was an early title published by Alfred A. Knopf and would go on to be revised three times in the author's lifetime. Reviews of the book praised it lavishly, with the exception of one by Mencken's old nemesis, Stuart Sherman. Many of the sources and research material associated with the book are in the Mencken collection at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland. Editions The first edition of 1919 was revised in 1921 and 1923; the fourth \\"corrected, revised, and enlarged\\" edition was published in 1936. Mencken released two full-sized Supplements to the main volume, in 1945 and 1948, based on the boom in linguistics articles. An abridged single-volume compilation of the original volume and supplements was edited by Raven I. McDavid Jr. and published in 1963.   * Sources *Hobson, Fred. Mencken.

A jughandle is a type of ramp or slip road that changes the way traffic turns left at an at-grade intersection (in a country where traffic drives on the right). Instead of a standard left turn being made from the left lane, left-turning traffic uses a ramp on the right side of the road. In a standard forward jughandle or near-side jughandle, the ramp leaves before the intersection, and left-turning traffic turns left off it rather than the through road. Right turns are also made using the jughandle. A typical jughandle setup, with one standard jughandle (below) and one reverse jughandle (above), on New Jersey Route 35 in Hazlet, New Jersey, United States. In a reverse jughandle or far-side jughandle, the ramp leaves after the intersection, and left-turning traffic loops around to the right and merges with the crossroad before the intersection. The jughandle is also known as a Jersey left due to its association with the U.S. state of New Jersey, though this term is also locally used for an abrupt left at the beginning of a green light cycle. Occasionally a setup is used where traffic on the side road cannot turn left at the intersection but turns left after it, merging with the main road. This is most often used for U-turns where a normal jughandle cannot be constructed; traffic turns left off the main road onto the ramp. Occasionally, a jughandle is removed if turning traffic is too heavy (see Disadvantages). In at least one case (Route 36 at Route 71, ) in New Jersey, the jughandle was kept for left turns, but U-turns are made from a left-turn lane. The New Jersey Department of Transportation defines three types of jughandles. \\"Type A\\" is the standard forward jughandle. \\"Type B\\" is a variant with no cross-street intersected by the jughandle; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street, and is either used at a \\"T\\" intersection or for a U-turn only. \\"Type C\\" is the standard reverse jughandle. History The first mention of jughandles in the New York Times is on June 14, 1959, referring to jughandles having been built in New Jersey on US 46 in Montville, US 22 between North Plainfield and Bound Brook, and Route 35 at Monmouth Park Racetrack. By the beginning of 1960, New Jersey had 160 jughandles, most if not all standard before-intersection jughandles. The 160th one was on U.S. Route 1 between New Brunswick and Trenton. Examples of signage at jughandles on New Jersey state highways.  Usage  Diagram of a jughandle intersection. All turning traffic exits to the right, before entering the cross road turning either to the left or right. = Canada = In Markham, Ontario: * Warden Avenue at Enterprise Boulevard (busway) In Toronto, Ontario: * York University Busway at Dufferin Street (busway) = Germany = In Cologne, North Rhine- Westphalia: * Aachener Stra√üe at Universit√§tsstra√üe, * Innerer Gr√ºng√ºrtel at Innere Kanalstra√üe and Subbelrather Stra√üe = Singapore = In Tampines: * Junction of Tampines Avenue 10 and Tampines Avenue 1 = United Kingdom = In Northern Ireland: * A8 at Ashley Road, = United States = States with a prevalence of jughandles include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Vermont. Jughandles are particularly associated with New Jersey. Jughandles are possible in other locations as they are a valid type of intersection control to consider for intersection design. Signage On New Jersey State Highways and Pennsylvania State Highways, a white sign is placed before a jughandle or at the beginning of a stretch of jughandles saying \\"All turns from right lane\\". Each jughandle is marked with a white sign below the standard green sign, saying \\"All turns\\", or \\"U and left turns\\" in the case of a reverse jughandle. On locally maintained roads, and in other states, jughandle signage can appear to be haphazard and confusing to out of state drivers. Generally on Pennsylvania Route 61, jughandles are common, and are signed as \\"All Turns (up/right arrow)\\". Advantages * Safety ** Removes left-turning vehicles from travel lanes, particularly from higher-speed left lanes. ** Pedestrian crossing distance is reduced across the mainline. ** Reduced left-turn conflict points as compared to a standard four-leg intersection. ** Removes conflicts with right-turning vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists at the primary intersection. * Operations ** Reduced overall travel time and delay through the intersection. ** Reduced signal phases due to the elimination of the associated left-turn phase(s). ** Increases queuing space for left-turning vehicles. ** Shorter pedestrian crossing distance across the mainline may provide for shorter cross street signal phases. ** May improve U-turns by reducing the need for a tight-radius turning maneuver which conflicts with cross-street right-turns. ** Reduced need for rights-of-way acquisition when there is not any room for a left turning lane; focuses land requirement near intersection rather than a long stretch that is often highly developed. Disadvantages * Safety ** Driver confusion, due to left-turns being made from the right side of the roadway ‚Äì an uncommon configuration outside of the northeastern United States. Expectancy issues may be compounded due to inconsistency between intersections, where some intersections may be jughandles and others may be standard intersections. These issues can be reduced through advance signing. ** Pedestrian conflict is increased along the cross street due to the addition of an additional intersecting approach. ** Creates a higher-speed conflict between vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists at the divergence point of the jughandle ramp. * Operations ** Increased travel time and delay for left- turning motorists redirected through jughandle. ** Increased overall percentage of vehicles stopped at the intersection. ** Potential for queues along the cross street to block the exit terminal of the jughandle, increasing stops, delays, and travel time of left-turning motorists. ** With reverse jughandles, motorists travel through the intersection twice: adding to the net movement demand. ** Motorists wishing to perform a U-turn maneuver at a reverse jughandle must perform a weaving maneuver across all cross-street lanes to travel from the jughandle terminus to the left-turn lane (unless another reverse jughandle is located on the other corner on the side of the cross street ahead of the motorist's original direction, in which case the motorist stays on the right but must cross through the intersection three times). ** To provide for motorist safety, the Federal Highway Administration recommends locating transit stops further from the intersection, outside of the jughandle ramps. This can reduce pedestrian demand due to the additional travel distance to access the transit stop. **\\"Type A\\" standard forward jughandles can encourage drivers to try beating (bypassing) the stopped redlight traffic by driving into the jughandle, turning left, and then turning right onto the original roadway to proceed in the original direction of travel prior to that roadway's light turning green again and releasing the stopped traffic. * Right-of-way ** Additional right-of-way may be required alongside the roadway, unless the existing street network can be utilized.

They were manufactured by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri for the United States Air Force (as F-101s), and later sold to Canada. CF-101s replaced the obsolete Avro CF-100 Canuck in the RCAF's all- weather fighter squadrons. The Voodoo's primary armament was nuclear AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets, and there was significant political controversy in Canada about their adoption. Although they never fired a weapon in wartime, the CF-101 served as Canada's primary means of air defence from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at Canadian airbases. The CF-101s were retired in the 1980s and replaced with McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighters. Many examples are preserved in museums and parks in Canada and the United States. Acquisition =Origins= After the cancellation of the CF-105 Arrow program in February 1959, George Pearkes, the Canadian Minister of National Defence officially maintained that the existing Avro CF-100 interceptors and the Bomarc missiles that had been ordered in September 1958 would be adequate for Canada's air defense needs. Unofficially, it was recognized that there was still a bomber threat, and discussions had been underway since before the formal conclusion of the Avro Arrow program concerning the RCAF acquiring an \\"off-the-shelf\\" interceptor from the United States. The USAF indicated that it was prepared to make 56 F-101B interceptors and 10 F-101F trainers available (by employing Convair F-102 Delta Daggers in less demanding NORAD sectors) for Canadian purchase. The deal was delayed for over a year by negotiations over acquisition costs and offsets, as well as debate within the Diefenbaker government about Canada adopting nuclear weapons systems, which had been agreed to, in principle, in 1958. The financial arrangements were sorted out by Canada taking over the staffing and funding of 11 Pinetree Line radar stations within Canada that had formerly been operated and funded by the USAF. A detailed agreement signed in June 1961 covered the transfer of the aircraft, meant to equip five front-line squadrons (replacing nine CF-100 squadrons) and an Operational Training Unit (OTU). =Nuclear weapons controversy= CF-101B firing AIR-2 Genie in 1982 The issue of nuclear weapons in Canada had not been resolved in June 1961, thus the CF-101s were armed only with their secondary AIM-4D Falcon missiles. In April 1963, the issue led to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government. The succeeding Pearson government signed an agreement with the United States concerning nuclear arms for Canada on 16 August 1963. The agreement did not actually state that Canada was acquiring nuclear weapons; the Canadian government usually refused to confirm or deny that there were any nuclear arms in Canada. The agreement specifically stated that the AIR-2A Genie rockets were the property of the United States and would only be released to Canada for actual use with the joint agreement of Canada and the United States through NORAD. The stringent training requirements meant that it took until June 1965 for the Genies to become operational in Canada. The Genies were kept in the custody of the USAF, with detachments of the 425th Munitions Support Squadron located at each of the Canadian bases. Operational history CF-101B Voodoo 17395 at the Bagotville Air Pageant, summer 1962. Notice the old-style Canadian flag. On 24 July 1961, the first two aircraft were transferred to Canada in a ceremony at RCAF Uplands in Ottawa, marking the beginning of Operation Queen's Row. 425 Squadron officially began Voodoo operations at RCAF Namao, Alberta, on 15 October 1961, initially acting as the conversion training squadron for 410, 416, 409, and 414 Squadrons. No. 425 Squadron then became an operational unit itself, turning the conversion role over to No. 3 All Weather OTU at RCAF Bagotville, Quebec. By the end of 1962, the squadrons were operating out of RCAF Comox, British Columbia, (409 Squadron), RCAF North Bay, Ontario, (414 Squadron), RCAF Uplands, Ottawa, Ontario, (410 Squadron), RCAF Bagotville, Quebec, (425 Squadron), and RCAF Chatham, New Brunswick, (416 Squadron). Defence cuts in 1964 eliminated Nos. 410 and 414 Squadrons (although a reformed 414 Squadron would operate the Voodoo years later). 409 \\"Nighthawk\\" Squadron, CFB Comox on the ramp at CFB Moose Jaw in 1982 Each Voodoo base was laid out to allow aircraft to be kept at immediate readiness at all times. A Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) facility was positioned at the end of the main runway to allow alert aircraft to launch as quickly as possible. Two aircraft and their crews were always on \\"five minute\\" alert ‚Äî the aircraft were to be in the air, en route to intercept unknown aircraft, within five minutes of receiving the order. In one instance, 416 Squadron was able to get two alert aircraft in the air only 57 seconds after receiving the alert. Voodoos were dispatched with some regularity to intercept unidentified NORAD radar contacts, usually airliners flying off course, although 416 and 425 occasionally intercepted Soviet Tu-95 Bear bombers flying along the Atlantic coast to Cuba. Fortunately, no situation ever arose in which a CF-101 pilot fired his weapons in anger. Between 1970 and 1972, Canada traded the 56 survivors of the original CF-101 fleet back to the USAF for 66 replacements under Operation Peace Wings. The \\"new\\" replacement aircraft were actually manufactured earlier than the original fleet, but the \\"new\\" airframes had a lower number of hours, plus the \\"new\\" Voodoos received updates which the original Canadian Voodoos had not received (including the addition of an IR tracking system). Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba, performed modifications on the incoming fleet, which involved transferring some specifically Canadian items of equipment, including engines, from the \\"old\\" aircraft to the \\"new.\\" Many of the \\"old\\" Canadian Voodoos were scrapped when they returned to the U.S., but 22 were converted to RF-101B photo-reconnaissance versions and flew with the Nevada Air National Guard until 1975. CF-101B (101057) from 409 Squadron in an airshow flypast on 13 June 1982 at CFB Edmonton During its service, the CF-101 was a popular performer at airshows and other events in Canada and the United States; displays ranged from a single aircraft's appearance to an entire squadron. In 1967, a CF-101 flew (in company with a CF-104 and The Red Knight T-33) in the Golden Centennaires display team to mark the nation's Centennial. In 1984, each squadron painted a special \\"show\\" aircraft to commemorate the type's impending retirement. 409 Squadron produced \\"Hawk One Canada,\\" 416 Squadron produced \\"Lynx One Canada,\\" and 425 Squadron produced \\"Lark One Canada/Alouette Un Canada.\\" =Obsolescence and retirement= Through the 1970s, the increasing obsolescence of the CF-101 and the CF-104 led to the New Fighter Aircraft program. Launched in 1977, the program sought a replacement for the CF-5, CF-104 Starfighter, and CF-101 Voodoo. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Falcon, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, Panavia Tornado, Dassault Mirage F1, and the Mirage 2000 were evaluated as potential replacements. Cost considerations reduced the choice to the F-16 and F-18; the F-18 was ultimately selected in April 1980. The Voodoo OTU converted to CF-18 Hornets in June 1982; 409 and 425 Squadrons also stood down in June 1984. In 1985 416 Squadron moved from CFB Chatham, New Brunswick to CFB Cold Lake, Alberta and converted from the CF-101 Voodoo to the CF-18 Hornet tactical fighter. With the stand down, the last nuclear weapons in Canada were returned to the United States. Two Voodoos remained in service after the stand-down: the unique EF-101B electronic jamming aircraft (also known as the \\"Electric Voodoo\\") and a single CF-101F trainer, in service with 414 Squadron at North Bay, Ontario. The EF-101B was a conversion of a regular F-101B, incorporating the electronic jamming suite from an EB-57E Canberra. Only one aircraft was converted before the program was cancelled and this sole example was leased to Canada. The last two Voodoos continued to fly until April 1987, when they were finally retired. The EF-101B was returned to the United States on 7 April 1987, while CF-101F 101006 made the world's last Voodoo flight on 9 April 1987, as it made a delivery flight from CFB North Bay to CFB Greenwood via CFB Bagotville and CFB Chatham for eventual display at CFB Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, where it decorated the parade square at the Recruit School. After CFB Cornwallis closed in 1995, 006 was moved to beside the Cornwallis Military Museum, located in the old St Georges Chapel on base. In October 2013, because of corrosion and security concerns, the museum donated 006 to the Jet Aircraft Museum in London, Ontario, where it is presently undergoing refurbishment.

Early life and education  Marion Philllips was born on 29 October 1881 in Melbourne, Australia. Her parents were Phillip Phillips, a lawyer, and Rose Asher, who was from New Zealand. She was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne and University of Melbourne, graduating in 1903. In 1904 began a research scholarship at the London School of Economics, graduating as a Doctor of Science in 1907, with a thesis about the development of New South Wales. Between 1906 and 1910 she worked under the direction of Beatrice Webb on a commission investigating the Poor Laws.  Career  A member of the Women's Labour League from 1908 she became its secretary in 1912. She also edited the League's leaflet, which by 1913 became Labour Woman. When World War I broke out she became a member of the War Emergency Workers' National Committee. In 1916 Phillips was present at the formation of the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women's Organisations. Phillips was its secretary between 1917 and 1932. Phillips also served on a number of government committees before a woman had been elected to the country's parliament. The most significant were the Consumer Council of the Ministry of Food and the Women's Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction. Unlike prominent suffragettes, her vision was not concentrated upon extending the franchise, she wanted state interventions in the free market to be better informed by considerations of life outside the workplace. As a leader of the Women's Labour League, she described its role as \\"keeping the Labour Party well informed of the needs of women and providing women with the means of becoming educated in political matters\\". In this endeavour she provoked about a quarter of a million housewives to take part in the labour movement and helped popularise issues such as equality for women in the workplace, school meals, clinics and playspaces for children, the fundamental value of mothering, a more humanitarian, safety-conscious, approach to the design of homes for ordinary families, and an eradication of needless drudgery and squalour from home life. :\\"Phillips and Margaret Bondfield worked tirelessly within the WLL to raise the political consciousness of women and encourage their participation, and although there was some tension between the two at the start, they eventually worked in harmony and shared an essentially social class based approach to women's emancipation and both were later Labour MPs together in 1929 (Bondfield having briefly been an MP in 1924).\\" Speaking on the need for adequate bathing and washing facilities in new housing projects, she remarked: \\"If Labour councillors will not support us on this demand, we shall have to cry a halt on all municipal housing until we have replaced all Labour men by Labour women\\". Addressing women in Hartlepool she emphasised, \\"There is still a lot of educating to do and we are going to begin by educating ourselves\\".

At the 1929 general election, Phillips was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sunderland. The 1929 'flapper election' was the first in which women under the age of 30 were eligible to vote.

It is notable for its positioning between Neoclassicism, the predominant style in Russia at the time, and Romanticism as increasingly practised in France. The painting was received to near universal acclaim and made Bryullov the first Russian painter to have an international reputation. In Russia it was seen as proving that Russian art was as good as art practised in the rest of Europe. Critics in France and Russia both noted, however, that the perfection of the classically modelled bodies seemed to be out of keeping with their desperate plight and the overall theme of the painting, which was a Romantic one of the sublime power of nature to destroy man's creations.

John Martin had painted The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1822 and others had sketched and produced engravings of the site. In 1823, Bryullov arrived in Rome with his brother Aleksandr via Venice and Florence.Leontyeva, Galina. (1996) Karl Briullov: Artist of Russian Romanticism.

He saw Alessandro Sanquirico's set designs for Giovanni Pacini's opera L'ultimo giorno di Pompei (1825), which was performed at Naples and at La Scala, Milan, and visited the Naples museum to study artefacts recovered from Pompeii. He certainly visited Pompeii in 1827 and according to Rosalind Blakesley, was so affected by the remains of the Via dei Sepolcri (Street of the Tombs) that he decided to set his painting in that street. Contemporary letters indicate that he studied Pliny the Younger's eye-witness description of the disaster, in which Pliny's uncle died, and Pliny's observations in his letters to Tacitus were referenced in the picture. Also in literature, Bryullov read Alessandro Manzoni's novel I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed) (1827) with its historically based account of a disastrous plague and the reactions to it of individuals.Leontyeva, p. 26.

It was to be completed by 1830 for the sum of 40,000 francs, but by the end of that year Bryullov had only got as far as outlining the figures on the canvas in two colours and had given little attention to colour choices. A trip to Bologna and Venice to see work by Tintoretto and Titian gave him the answers he needed.Leontyeva, pp. 30‚Äì31.

Retrieved 22 November 2017. Subject and composition The subject is the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 that enveloped the city of Pompeii in volcanic ash killing most of its inhabitants. As a scene from the ancient world it was an appropriate subject for a history painting, then regarded as the highest genre of painting, and the magnitude of the event also made it suitable for a large canvas that would allow Bryullov to showcase all his skills. Bryullov said that he could only have completed the work with the example of Raphael's large and complex work The School of Athens (1509‚Äì1511) as his model,Leontyeva, p. 20. and he used classical forms recognisable as those used by the Renaissance masters, but combined them with features found in Romantic painting, such as dramatic colouring, the use of chiaroscuro, and a high emotional content. Other works thought to have influenced Bryullov are Raphael's The Fire in the Borgo (1514‚Äì17) and Nicolas Poussin's ' (1630). He eschewed the coolness and flatness of the then-prevalent Neoclassicism in favour of excitement and vibrant colour, combined with a deep recession as a horse bolts into the depths of the painting, unseating its master. Nikolai Gogol commented: \\"His colouring is possibly brighter than it has ever been; his paints burn and hit you in the eye\\", but he was not the only one to note that the perfection of the classical figures contrasted with the wretchedness of their predicament. Bryullov filled the canvas with authentic detail from Pompeii that he had seen at the site and in the museum at Naples such as the artefacts carried by the figures and the authentic paving and kerb stones. Statues toppling from their pedestals bring additional drama and demonstrate the sublime power of nature over man, a common trope in Romantic painting. The figures provide small vignettes of individual experience that reference stories from classical mythology, renaissance painting or ancient literature such as Pliny the Younger's account given to Tacitus, but most of the characters preserve their dignity in the face of death indicating Bryullov's great debt to the principals of Classicism. Poses and figures are drawn from classical painting or from people the artist knew such as Yuliya Samoylova and her daughters. The soldier and boy rescuing an older man may derive from the story of Aeneas's rescue of his father from the destruction of Troy in mythology. To the scene is added an image of the artist himself as a Pompeian artist with his equipment balanced on his head. Reception The Last Day of Pompeii alongside ' (1840) by Feodor Bruni at the New Hermitage in 1856 in a watercolour by Edward P. Hau The painting took so long to finish that Demidov threatened to cancel its commission, but when it was first shown at Bryullov's studio in Italy on Via San Claudio in Rome, it received a rapturous response. Sir Walter Scott is said to have studied the painting for an hour before declaring that it was not an ordinary painting, but an epic and Vincenzo Camuccini described it as a \\"flaming colossus\\". The Italian archaeologist Pietro Ercole Visconti wrote an article praising the painter and the painting. The Uffizi requested a self-portrait of the artist. In Milan, Bryullov was given a standing ovation in a theatre and carried through the city's streets wearing a garland of flowers. It was seen there by Edward Bulwer-Lytton whose novel The Last Days of Pompeii was published in 1834. In Bologna, gallery officials removed Raphael's St Cecilia from the walls and placed it in a private room when Bryullov asked to copy it. The reception was slightly cooler when it was displayed at the Paris Salon of 1834. It still won a gold medal, but some critics saw it as slightly outdated compared to Eug√®ne Delacroix's Femmes d'Alger dans leur Appartement (1834), which was exhibited alongside it, the high emotional content leading one critic to comment in L'Artiste, \\"l'impression est moins voisine de la terreur que du ridicule\\" (the impression is less akin to terror than ridicule).\\"Salon de 1834. Peinture\\", L'Artiste, Vol. 7, No. 12 (1834), p. 136. Rosalind Blakesley attributes this slightly behind-the-times feel to the isolation of contemporary Russian art teaching from the latest French developments since the start of the nineteenth century and the tensions inherent in the work between neo-classicism and romanticism. It was the first Russian artwork to cause such an interest abroad, making Bryullov the first Russian painter to gain an international reputation. Five foreign academies made him an honorary member and the quantity of positive reviews and critical comment was such that the Society for the Encouragement of Artists published a volume of them in Russian translation. When the painting arrived in Russia in August 1834, it was received with as much enthusiasm as it had been in Italy, according to Gogol as much by those with a refined taste as those who were ignorant of art.Leontyeva, p. 35. Bryullov was made an honorary free associate of the academy and awarded the Order of St Anne, third class. He was made a professor at the academy in Saint Petersburg and placed in charge of history painting. He met the Tsar. Ivan Turgenev described the painting as \\"the glory of Russia and Italy\\" and it inspired Alexander Pushkin to write a poem about the destruction of Pompeii. Russians saw the painting as elevating the status of Russian art in Europe generally and in turn it elevated the status of painters in Russia. Gogol opined that it was a \\"bright resurrection of painting, which has been for too long in some sort of semi-lethargic state\\", but was not alone in seeing a parallel between Pompeii and contemporary Saint Petersburg and the painting as a forecast of divine retribution for the modern city's decadent Western ways.\\"Tales of St Petersburg\\" by Orlando Figes in Frank Althaus and Mark Sutcliffe (2003) Petersburg Perspectives. St Petersburg: Fontanka with Booth-Clibborn Editions. pp. 91‚Äì105 (p. 97). The dissident Alexander Herzen, meanwhile, saw it as an allegory about the collapse of European monarchies or the tyrannical power of the Russian state over the individual.Leontyeva, p. 36.

It was at first exhibited in the Winter Palace, but in 1836 Nicholas donated it to the Imperial Academy of Arts where it remained until it was installed as the centre of the Russian painting display at the New Hermitage in 1851.

The circle is the point from which official highway distances from New York City are measured, as well as the center of the restricted-travel area for C-2 visa holders. The circle is named after the monument of Christopher Columbus in the center, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The name is also used for the neighborhood that surrounds the circle for a few blocks in each direction. Hell's Kitchen (also known as \\"Clinton\\") is located to the southwest, while the Theater District is to the southeast and the Lincoln Square section of the Upper West Side is to the northwest.  Circle  The traffic circle, located at Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and 59th Street/Central Park South, was designed as part of Frederick Law Olmsted's 1857 vision for Central Park, which included a rotary on the southwest corner of the park. It abuts the Merchant's Gate, one of the park's eighteen major gates. Similar plazas were planned at the southeast corner of the park (now Grand Army Plaza), the northeast corner (Duke Ellington Circle), and the northwest corner (Frederick Douglass Circle). Clearing of the land area for the circle started in 1868. The actual circle was approved two years later. The Columbus Monument was placed at the center of the circle in 1892. Columbus Circle was originally known generically as \\"The Circle\\". An 1871 account of the park referred to the roundabout as a \\"grand circle\\". After the 1892 installation of the Columbus Column in the circle's center, it became known as \\"Columbus Circle\\", although its other names were also used through the 1900s. =Modifications= Subway construction By 1901, construction on the first subway line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (now the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, used by the ) required the excavation of the circle, and the column and streetcar tracks through the area were put on temporary wooden stilts. As part of the subway line's construction, the 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle station was built underneath the circle. During construction, traffic in the circle was so dangerous that the Municipal Art Society proposed redesigning the roundabout. By February 1904, the station underneath was largely complete, and service on the subway line began on October 27, 1904. The station only served local trains; express trains bypassed the station. The platforms of the IRT subway station were lengthened in 1957‚Äì1959, requiring further excavations around Columbus Circle. An additional subway line‚Äîthe Independent Subway System (IND)'s Eighth Avenue Line, serving the present-day ‚Äîwas built starting in 1925. At Columbus Circle, workers had to be careful to not disrupt the existing IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line or Columbus Circle overhead. The Columbus monument was shored up during construction, and obstructions to traffic were minimized. The line, which opened in 1932, contains a 4-track, 3-platform express station at 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle, underneath the original IRT station. The IND station were designed as a single transit hub under Columbus Circle. Eno's traffic plan The second of Eno's Columbus Circle plans, 1909 In November 1904, due to the high speeds of cars passing through the circle, the New York City Police Department added tightly spaced electric lights on the inner side of the circle, surrounding the column. The current circle was redesigned in 1905 by William Phelps Eno, a businessman who pioneered many early innovations in road safety and traffic control.Henebery, Ann. \\"The Rules of the Road: Then Versus Now\\" , Eno Center for Transportation, October 6, 2015. Accessed October 9, 2017. \\"William P. Eno is internationally recognized as an original pioneer of traffic regulation and safety.... He was dubbed the 'Father of Traffic Safety' and many of the traffic-flow innovations that we now take for granted were a result of Eno‚Äôs hard work. He is credited with designing Columbus Circle in New York City and the traffic circle surrounding the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\\" In a 1920 book, Eno writes that prior to the implementation of his plan, traffic went around the circle in both directions, causing accidents almost daily. The 1905 plan, which he regarded as temporary, created a counterclockwise traffic pattern with a \\"safety zone\\" in the center of the circle for cars stopping; however, the circle was too narrow for the normal flow of traffic. Eno also wrote of a permanent plan, with the safety zones on the outside as well as clearly delineated pedestrian crossings. The redesign marked the first true one-way traffic circle to be constructed anywhere, implementing the ideas of Eug√®ne H√©nard. In this second scheme, the public space within the circle, around the monument, was almost as small as the monument's base. The rotary traffic plan was not successful. A New York Times article in June 1929 stated that the \\"Christopher Columbus [monument] is safe and serene, but he's the only thing in the Circle that is.\\" At the time, there were eight entrance and exit points to Columbus Circle: two each from 59th Street/Central Park South, to the west and east; Broadway, to the northwest and southeast; Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, to the south and north; and within Central Park to the northeast. Moreover, streetcars on the former three streets did not go counterclockwise around the rotary, but rather, both tracks of all three streetcar routes went around one side of the monument, creating frequent conflicts between streetcars and automobiles using the rotary in opposite directions. The police officers patrolling the circle had to manage the 58,000 cars that entered Columbus Circle every 12 hours. As part of a plan to reorganize traffic in the \\"Columbus-Central Park Zone\\", Eno's circular-traffic plan was abolished in November 1929, and traffic was allowed to go around the circle in both directions. Central Park West, a one-way street that formerly carried southbound traffic into the circle, was now one-way northbound. The bidirectional entrance roads into Central Park, which fed into northbound and eastbound West Drive, were both changed to one-way streets because West Drive had been changed from bidirectional to one-way southbound and eastbound. Traffic going straight through Columbus Circle was forced to go around the left side of the monument, while any traffic making turns from the circle had to go counterclockwise around the rotary using the right side. Mid-20th century configurations Columbus Circle in 1939, looking east The bidirectional traffic pattern through Columbus Circle failed to eliminate congestion. In 1941, engineers with the New York City Parks Department and the Manhattan Borough President's office formed a tentative agreement to redesign Columbus Circle yet again. \\"Local\\" and \\"express\\" lanes would segregate north- south traffic passing within the circle. Local north-south traffic and all east-west traffic would go around the circle's perimeter in a counterclockwise direction, along a roadway. Through north-south traffic on Broadway, Eighth Avenue, and Central Park West would use two divided roadways with landscaped medians, running in chords on either side of the Columbus monument. Traffic from southbound Broadway and northbound Eighth Avenue would use the western chord, and northbound Broadway and southbound Central Park West would use the eastern chord. The center of the circle would be refurbished with a tree-lined plaza, and pedestrian traffic from the north and south would be able to pass through the center of the circle. The exit into Columbus Circle from West Drive would be eliminated, and the entrance to West Drive would be relocated. In a related development, the 59th Street trolley route's tracks would be removed. This was crucial to the reorganization of the circle, as the trolley had already been discontinued. The proposed reorganization of Columbus Circle was widely praised by civic groups and city officials. On the other hand, William Phelps Eno advocated for a return to his original 1905 proposal. However, the plan still had some issues, the largest of which was that traffic traveling on Broadway in either direction would be routed onto Eighth Avenue or Central Park West, and vice versa. The reconfiguration of the circle was deferred due to World War II. The trolley routes that ran through Columbus Circle were discontinued in 1946, but the bus routes that replaced the trolley lines took the same convoluted paths through the circle. In June 1949, it was announced that the reconstruction of Columbus Circle would finally begin. Work on removing the abandoned trolley tracks commenced in August. In conjunction with Columbus Circle's rehabilitation, the New York City Department of Transportation designed a variable traffic light system for the circle. The project was originally set to be complete by November 1949 at a cost of $100,000. However, delays arose due to the need to maintain traffic flows through the circle during construction. The project was ultimately completed that December. The entirety of Eighth Avenue south of Columbus Circle was converted to northbound-only traffic in 1950. In 1956, in preparation for the opening of the New York Coliseum on Columbus Circle's west side, traffic on Central Park West and Broadway was rearranged. Central Park West was made northbound-only for a short segment north of the circle, and two blocks of Broadway south of the circle were converted to southbound-only. A new northbound roadway was cut through the southern tip of the center traffic island that contained the statue, from Eighth Avenue to the eastern chord. At the same time, the eastern chord was converted to northbound-only. 1990s and 2000s renovation By the late 20th century, it was regarded as one of the most inhospitable of the city's major intersections, as the interior circle was being used for motorcycle parking, and the circle as a whole was hard for pedestrians to cross. In 1979, noted architecture critic Paul Goldberger said that the intersection was \\"a chaotic jumble of streets that can be crossed in about 50 different ways‚Äîall of them wrong.\\" In 1987, the city awarded a $20 million contract to Olin Partnership and Vollmer Associates to create a new design for the circle. The circle was refurbished in 1991‚Äì1992 as part of the 500th-anniversary celebration of Columbus's arrival in the Americas. In 1998, as a result of the study, the circular-traffic plan was reinstated, with all traffic going around the circle in a counterclockwise direction. The center of the circle was planned for further renovations, with a proposed park across. The design for a full renovation of the circle was finalized in 2001. The project started in 2003, and was completed in 2005. It included a new water fountain by Water Entertainment Technologies, who also designed the Fountains of Bellagio; benches made of ipe wood; and plantings encircling the monument. The fountain, the main part of the reconstructed circle, contains 99 jets that periodically change in force and speed, with effects ranging between \\"swollen river, a rushing brook, a driving rain or a gentle shower\\". The inner circle is about , while the outer circle is around . The redesign was the recipient of the 2006 American Society of Landscape Architects‚Äô General Design Award Of Honor. In 2007 Columbus Circle was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal. =As a geographic center= Columbus Circle is the traditional municipal zero-mile point from which all official city distances are measured, although Google Maps uses New York City Hall for this purpose. For decades, Hagstrom sold maps that showed the areas within or from Columbus Circle. The travel area for recipients of a C-2 visa, which is issued for the purpose of immediate and continuous transit to or from the headquarters of the United Nations, is limited to a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle. The same circle coincidentally defines the city's \\"film zone\\" that local unions operate in, a counterpart to Los Angeles' studio zone. The New York City government employee handbook considers a trip beyond a 75-mile radius from Columbus Circle as long-distance travel. = History of soapbox orators = The circle became known as a center for soapbox orators in the early-mid 20th century, comparable to Speakers Corner in London. It became a home particularly for non-leftists in contrast to Union Square, and for a time in the late 1930s it became a home to a number of far right speakers. The area sometimes had a poor reputation for cranks and street preachers, the \\"lunatic fringe whose tub-thumping make a nightmare of Columbus Circle\\" condemned by a New York Court of Appeals ruling in a case related to elsewhere in the city, that prompted mid-20th century configurations, but was also sometimes showcased by the national government as a rambunctious symbol of American freedom of speech.  Monument  Columbus Monument The Columbus Monument, a column installed at the center of Columbus Circle, consists of a marble statue of Columbus atop a granite rostral column on a four-stepped granite pedestal. Created by Italian sculptor Gaetano Russo, the monument was installed at the center of the circle in 1892. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Neighborhood The five streets that radiate outward from Columbus Circle separate the immediate neighborhood around the circle into five distinct portions. = West = To the west of the circle is a superblock spanning two streets, bounded by Broadway, 60th Street, Ninth Avenue, 58th Street, and Eighth Avenue. The superblock was formerly two separate blocks. From 1902 to 1954, the Majestic Theatre occupied the more southerly of the two blocks. Robert Moses demapped 59th Street through the block during the New York Coliseum's construction from 1954 to 1956. The construction project, in turn, was the culmination of an effort to remove San Juan Hill, the slum that had been located at the site. Until the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was built in Hell's Kitchen in the 1980s, the Coliseum was the primary event venue for New York City. By 1985, there were plans to replace the Coliseum, and after a series of delays, the Coliseum was demolished in 2000. Since 2003, the site has been occupied by Time Warner Center, the world headquarters of the Time Warner corporation. The center consists of a pair of towers 53 stories high. The complex also hosts the Shops at Columbus Circle mall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the New York City studio headquarters of CNN, and the Mandarin Oriental, New York hotel. The mall inside the complex includes prestigious restaurants in the center such as Landmarc, Per Se and Masa. View of Columbus Circle, looking east at Central Park South from inside the Time Warner Center = North = On the north side of Columbus Circle, bounded by Broadway, Central Park West, and 61st Street, is the Trump International Hotel and Tower, with its noted steel globe, which had been an office tower, the headquarters of the Gulf+Western conglomerate, which was stripped to its steel skeleton and reclad in a new facade. The Gulf and Western Building, a 44-story building completed in 1969 or 1970, filed for bankruptcy in 1991. In 1994, Donald Trump announced his plans to convert the building into a mixed-purpose hotel and condominium units, with hotel rooms below the 14th floor and condominiums above that floor. Renovations started in 1995 after Gulf and Western's lease lapsed and Trump took control of the building. That renovation was complete by 1997. = Northeast = On the northeast lies the Merchant's Gate to Central Park, dominated by the USS Maine National Monument. The USS Maine monument was designed by Harold Van Buren Magonigle and sculpted by Attilio Piccirilli, who did the colossal group and figures, and Charles Keck, who was responsible for the \\"In Memoriam\\" plaque. An imposing Beaux-Arts edifice of marble and gilded bronze, it was dedicated in 1913 as a memorial to sailors killed aboard the battleship USS Maine, whose mysterious 1898 explosion in Havana harbor precipitated the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.USS Maine National Monument , New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed October 9, 2017. = South = Actors' Equity was founded in 1913 in the old Pabst Grand Circle Hotel, located at 2 Columbus Circle on the southern side of the circle. The building was torn down in 1960 in order to construct a distinctive new International Modernist tower designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone to house the Huntington Hartford Gallery of Modern Art. Vacant since the city's Department of Cultural Affairs departed in 1998, it was listed as one of the World Monuments Fund's \\"100 most endangered sites\\" in 2006. After a renovation by architect Brad Cloepfil, the building became the new home for Museum of Arts and Design in 2008. Its radical transformation was controversial for the failure of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold hearings on its worthiness for designation. = Southeast = 240 Central Park South, a balconied moderne apartment building across Broadway from the museum, is on the southeast side of the circle. Built in 1941, it is a city-designated landmark with a new addition, a green roof, atop its retail base. = 3, 4, 5, and 6 Columbus Circle = U.S. Rubber Headquarters constructed at 1790 Broadway in 1912 3, 4, 5, and 6 Columbus Circle are the numbers given to four buildings on the south side of 58th Street. From east to west, the buildings are numbered 5, 3, 4, and 6 Columbus Circle. 5 Columbus Circle (also known by its address, 1790 Broadway), is a , 20-story tower on the southeast corner of Broadway and 58th Street. It was originally built as the headquarters of the United States Rubber Company (U.S. Rubber) in 1912. It was part of Broadway's \\"Automobile Row\\" during the early 20th century. U.S. Rubber moved to a new headquarters in 1940, and the building was sold several times before being acquired by the West Side Federal Savings and Loan Association. The First Nationwide Savings Bank, which acquired the West Side Federal Savings bank, sold the building in 1985 to 1790 Broadway Associates, its current owners. The lobby contains part of an under- construction flagship store for Nordstrom, which is planned to open in 2019; the store itself would be located under three buildings on the block. Between Eighth Avenue and Broadway on the south side of 58th Street is 3 Columbus Circle (also 1775 Broadway), a , 26-story tower. It is occupied by Young & Rubicam, Bank of America, Chase Bank, and Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co. The tower sits atop a 3-story structure called the Colonnade Building. The first 3 stories were built in 1923 and the top 23 stories were added as part of a large expansion in 1927‚Äì1928. During the expansion, the original building's three-story Ionic supports were kept. The new expansion, designed by Shreve & Lamb, hosted General Motors' headquarters from 1927 to 1968. In 1969, Midtown Realty purchased the building's lease, and in 1980, acquired the land. Half of the building was leased by Bankers Trust until the late 1980s, and Newsweek leased a third of the building from 1994 until 2006. When the Moinian Group purchased the building in 2000, the building assumed its current name; a subsequent renovation refurbished the exterior and removed all remnants of the Colonnade Building. A neon sign for CNN was located on the roof of the building from the mid-2000s to 2015. An annex of Nordstrom for menswear has opened at the base of 3 Columbus Circle. 4 Columbus Circle, an eight-story low-rise located at 989 Eighth Avenue at the southwest corner of the intersection with 58th Street, was built in the late 1980s. Swanke Hayden Connell Architects designed the building, which houses the furniture company Steelcase on the upper floors and a Duane Reade and a Starbucks on the ground floor. Cerberus Capital Management bought the building in 2006 for $82.9 million. In 2011, it was sold to German real estate firm GLL Real Estate Partners for $96.5 million. Directly to the west is 6 Columbus Circle, an 88-room, 12-floor boutique hotel called 6 Columbus. Acquired by the Pomeranc Group in 2007, the hotel was put on sale in December 2015. A tower is planned for the site. Transportation The buses all serve the circle, with the M5, M7, M20 and M104 providing through service and the southbound M10 terminating near the circle. Under the circle is the New York City Subway's 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle station, served by the . In popular culture Columbus Circle was also featured in the 1954 romantic comedy film It Should Happen to You. In the film, Judy Holliday's character, Gladys Glover, began her quest for fame by renting a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle, on which she had her name emblazoned. Columbus Circle, and in particular the USS Maine Memorial, was featured in the 1976 movie Taxi Driver, where Robert De Niro's character was thwarted in an attempt to assassinate a presidential nominee. The shooting of Joseph Colombo in Columbus Circle by Jerome A. Johnson in 1971 was featured in the 2019 film The Irishman.

To prevent confusion with an existing insurance company Nillmij, it was appended with the Koninklijk (Royal) title on 15 October 1928. The airline operated in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), and later, parts of Southeast Asia and Australia. Oelin Its first regular operations were between Batavia (now Jakarta) - Bandung, and Batavia - Semarang, starting on 1 November 1928. The ceremony was held at Cililitan airport in Batavia (now Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport). The Batavia-Semarang flight was later extended to Surabaya. Gradually, the services were expanded to include other islands in the archipelago, namely to Palembang and Medan in Sumatra, Balikpapan and Tarakan in Kalimantan, and Denpasar in Bali. Immediately before the Pacific War, KNILM also created a network in the eastern part of the East Indies archipelago, serving towns such as Ambon. For this purpose, amphibious aircraft were used, due to the lack of airstrip facilities in the region. As early as 1930, KNILM began its first international flight to Singapore. On 3 July 1938 KNILM began operations to Sydney, stopping at Darwin, Cloncurry and Charleville. KNILM did not fly to the Netherlands, as the Amsterdam-Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM. =Routes (in 1936)= Governor-General Jhr.

On December 28, 1941, a KNILM Douglas DC-3 \\"Nandoe\\" (PK-ALN) was destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters at Medan, killing all crew members and passengers. Immediately before and after the Japanese invasion on 1 March 1942, all KNILM aircraft with sufficient range were evacuated to Australia. On 7 March 1942, one day before the capitulation of Java, the last KNILM aircraft took off from the Boeabatoeweg in Bandung. A number of KNILM aircraft in Darwin were destroyed by the Japanese during the bombing of Darwin. In all, 11 KNILM aircraft managed to escape to Australia: 3 Douglas DC-5s, 2 DC-3s, 2 DC-2s and 3 Lockheed Model 14 Super Electras. In mid-May 1942 the remaining aircraft were sold to the American military. After Indonesian independence the KNILM could no longer operate due to the fighting between Indonesian nationalists and the Dutch military. All flights in the period were flown using military aircraft, coordinated through the Netherlands Indies Government Air Transport (NIGAT). On paper, KNILM was reinstated to operate charter flights to eastern Indonesian locations. Starting on 16 November 1946 it operated a weekly trans- Pacific flight between Batavia and Los Angeles. The service was performed with four-engined DC-4s of the NIGAT. It was not successful and was discontinued after a few months. KNILM was officially disbanded on 1 August 1947, and the remaining assets were transferred to KLM, which created the KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (Interinsular Service - present time Garuda Indonesia) to operate air services in the Indonesian archipelago.

The band formed in 1985 and has existed somewhat sporadically ever since. While last playing live in 1999, the band recorded two more albums and while they have publicly declared to have disbanded several times since, the group reunited for a single performance in November 2009 at the first annual Australian Metal Awards in Sydney. Early history The band was formed after bass player Dave Slave met vocalist Rok outside an Iron Maiden concert in Sydney in 1985. In Melbourne, they connected with former Slaughter Lord guitarist Sandy Vahdanni and drummer Sloth Monkey, who was Dave Slave's distant cousin. With this formation, Sadistik Exekution recorded a demo and completed the album The Magus. Kriss Hades was then asked to join on guitar alongside Vahdanni, but in the meantime, Vahdanni left, stalling the band's further activity. Nevertheless, the band's outrageous behaviour on stage had already won them a fan base long before the album had even been recorded. During Slave and Rok's stay in Melbourne seeking musicians, Slave had appeared on the talent-quest segment of the Hey Hey It's Saturday TV program and proceeded to simply smash his bass guitar. Both he and Rok had featured in articles about extreme metal in the Australian Post and People magazines and both had a reputation for turning up to virtually any heavy metal live show that was on to hand out stickers and flyers and intimidate people by doing \\"disgusting things in front of them.\\" The band was well known among the key members of the Norwegian and Swedish black metal scene. Euronymous from Mayhem can be seen wearing one of the band's T-shirts in a photograph later used as the cover of the famous Tribute to the Black Emperors bootleg album. In addition, Rok was penpals with Quorthon, the lead singer and founder of Bathory. Their correspondence included Rok sending demonic hand-drawn pictures to Quorthon ‚Äì who, in return, mailed back bones from an unknown skeleton, which Rok interpreted as a sign to continue his work further. The Magus was finally released in 1991 by the Sydney label Vampire Records. In the meantime, their performances featured Hades playing with dozens of safety pins in his flesh and Rok and Dave Slave often exhorting the crowd into singalongs. Audiences responded by throwing flowers and smiling, and the singer and bass player would often retaliate by entering the crowd and punching people. We Are Death In 1993, Sloth left the band once again as they recorded their second album, and Steve \\"The Mechanik\\" Hoban played on one track. The completed album was sent to French label Osmose Productions. Though intended to be self-titled, Hades had written We Are Death... Fukk You! on the tapes as a reaction to what they believed was constant misrepresentation as a black metal band; the label mistook the words to be the title of the album and released it under that name. It quickly became a best-selling release for the label and in 1995 the group was invited on a European tour with Finnish band Impaled Nazarene and American act Absu. Hoban had injured his back at a Bolt Thrower concert after the recording sessions and was no longer able to play the drums. The Melbourne grindcore band Damaged had recently split up and drummer Matt \\"Skitz\\" Sanders was recruited by Sadistik Exekution. It was during this tour that one of the most famous incidents in the band's history occurred. Sadistik Exekution had never done a full tour and were in fact better known for only playing once or twice a year. Sharing a bus with two other bands, Dave Slave lost control, destroying the tour bus. The tour proceeded the next day with the guitarist playing the rest of the shows with a badly broken finger. Upon returning to Australia, Sadistik Exekution ceased all activity for over a year while Hades recovered. K.A.O.S. With Sloth back in the band once more, Sadistik Exekution returned in 1997 with their third album, K.A.O.S.. Faster and rawer than anything the band had produced before, the album saw the beginning of a particularly active period for Sadistik Exekution with a steady stream of live performances and other projects. Dave Slave had been working on an album of electronic rock n‚Äô roll for several years, finally releasing it under the name Digital Fiction in 1998 through a Brisbane distributor called Oracle. Early the same year, Rok recorded two solo albums, with Osmose releasing the first, This is Satanik, toward the end of the year. Kriss Hades joined the Sydney black metal band Nazxul, with whom he recorded an EP. Sloth recorded a series of demos consisting of some of his many punk rock songs under the name Bog. At the end of the year, shortly after Rok had performed a solo show, Sadistik Exekution reconvened to play on New Year's Eve. It was billed as their last show ever, but the band had often advertised their performances this way. Indeed, a few months later they took to the stage again at Sydney's Globe Theatre. This show, however, was fated to be Sadistik Exekution's last ever concert. The band remained dormant for the remainder of the year as Hades toured with Nazxul and the others concerned themselves with personal projects once more. Rok's second album, Burning Metal, appeared in 2000, and Kriss Hades began piecing together several tracks that would make up his solo debut. The band maintained that it had ended as a live act, but when the line-up for that year's Metal for the Brain festival was announced, Sadistik Exekution was billed as one of the headliners. While anticipation among fans was high that the country's most notorious death metal band was finally making an appearance at Australia's biggest metal event, Dave Slave broke his leg in a fight shortly before the show and the band had to withdraw. Final recordings A further two Sadistik Exekution albums were recorded, the first, Fukk released in 2002 and the second, simply called Fukk II, appearing two years later. Dave Slave has often affirmed that the band is no more, claiming to be busy with his solo act Doomed and Disgusting. He has also expressed an interest in acting, having made an appearance in a TV advertisement for The Real McCoy Snackfoods in 2003. Kriss Hades has established himself as a solo artist, producing an album of noise and dark ambience in 2002. He also maintains a parallel career as an underground artist. Sloth joined a western Sydney thrash band called Inslain in 2003 and was later member of a rock band called 8 Ball Junkies. Despite this, Sadistik Exekution made a live return in November 2009 as the featured act at the Australian Metal Awards in Sydney. In 2009 Rok appeared on JJJ's leading Heavy Metal radio show The Racket with Andrew Haug, Rok gave a lengthy interview with Andrew and spoke of his many adventures. In the interview, Rok made no further comments about Sadistik Exekution recording further albums. Later that month they appeared to a packed house at Fox Studios for the Australian Heavy Metal awards night where they were given the final spot for the night.

Its statutory functions were to conduct research on radiological protection and provide advice and information on the subject to Government Departments and others. It was also authorized to provide technical services and charge for them. Originally NRPB dealt only with ionizing radiation, but its functions were extended in 1974 to non-ionizing radiation. Structure The Board consisted of a chairman and a maximum of nine other members, later increased to twelve, all appointed by Health Ministers. Throughout its existence, NRPB had 300 members of staff on average. They were located at the headquarters in Chilton near Oxford and at laboratories in Leeds and Glasgow. The Department of Health funded the difference between the cost of NRPB and its income by annual grant. Work Research on ionizing radiation included: plutonium exposure; internal dosimetry; radioactive discharges; nuclear accidents and wastes; radon hazards; medical x rays; epidemiology and molecular biology. Research on non- ionizing radiation included the physics and biology of exposure to ultraviolet sources, electricity supplies, and mobile phones. As well as a full range of technical services - from personnel dosimetry to radiation surveys - NRPB also engaged in projects such as: the safe transport of radioactive materials; preparedness for nuclear emergencies; exposure to cosmic rays; optimization of protection; improved radiation instruments; training courses; a wide selection of publications. Members of staff contributed to major public inquiries about the nuclear industry in the UK and supported the UK response to the Chernobyl disaster. They also participated in the work of the: International Commission on Radiological Protection; International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection; United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation; Nuclear Energy Agency; various committees of the Commission of the European Communities. Transition The Health Protection Agency Act 2004 repealed the Radiological Protection Act. On 1 April 2005, NRPB became the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the HPA was abolished, and responsibility for radiation protection functions was assigned to the Public Health England Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE) at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus near Chilton, Oxfordshire.

U.S. Route 2 travels over the pass, reaching a maximum elevation of . The Pacific Crest Trail crosses the highway at Stevens Pass. The BNSF Railway's Cascade Tunnel lies below the pass summit. The pass is near Stevens Pass Ski Area, which is on Cowboy Mountain and Big Chief Mountain. History Stevens Pass is named after John Frank Stevens, the first non-indigenous person to discover it. Native Americans familiar with the area knew of the pass, although very little is known about Native American routes through the mountains. Hubert C. Ward, exploring the area for the Northern Pacific Railway in 1872, heard from some Native Americans that there was a low pass at the head of Nason Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River, which led to one of the sources of the Skykomish River. Albert Bowman Rogers of the Great Northern Railway, learned from Native Americans in 1887 that the Skykomish River and Nason Creek had sources close to one another but that neither natives nor whites visited the Nason Creek area. Neither Ward nor Rogers had time to fully explore the area. In 1890, Stevens conducted a thorough survey for the Great Northern, located the pass, and determined it to be the best suited for a railway crossing of the North Cascades. He wrote that there was no indication that the pass was used ‚Äî there was no sign of any trails, blazes, campsites, or old campfires, for at least in either direction and that the area was thickly forested and covered with almost impenetrable brush. Stevens wrote, \\"the region promised nothing to the prospector, while Indians and Whites crossing the mountains used either Snoqualmie on the south or the Indian Pass on the north.\\" Stevens had also charted Marias Pass in northwestern Montana, on the Continental Divide near Glacier National Park.

Notable avalanches On February 23, 1910, the two Great Northern Railway trains, the \\"Seattle Express\\" local passenger train No. 25 and Fast Mail train No. 27, were stalled on the tracks at the Cascade Tunnel Station on Stevens Pass because of a heavy snow storm and avalanches. Then on March 1, six days later, another avalanche pushed both trains down into the Tye River Valley, thus burying the train cars in snow and debris. The Wellington Disaster killed ninety-six people ‚Äì thirty-five passengers and sixty-one railroad employees ‚Äì which made the Wellington avalanche one of the worst train disasters in United States history.NWDA Washington State University: Wellington Disaster Over a century later, an avalanche occurred on February 19, 2012 near Tunnel Creek Canyon Road, killing three of four experienced backcountry skiers, including the Stevens Pass Ski Area's marketing director; professional skier Elyse Saugstad, who was wearing an avalanche airbag backpack, survived after tumbling down for more than 2,000 feet (600 m).

It is located 50 km south of Madrid in the town of Aranjuez. It was established around the time Philip II of Spain moved the capital from Toledo to Madrid. Aranjuez became one of four seasonal seats of government, occupied during the springtime (from about holy week). Thereafter, the court moved successively to Rascafr√≠a, El Escorial and wintered in Madrid. Several international treaties were signed there and several members of the royal family died there, including: * 1568 Elizabeth of Valois queen consort of Philip II * 1758 Barbara of Portugal queen consort of Ferdinand VI * 1766 Elisabeth Farnese the widow of Philip V * 1806 Maria Antonia of Naples first wife of Ferdinand VII the Felon * 1818 Maria Isabel of Portugal second wife of Ferdinand VII * 1828 Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony third wife of Ferdinand VII In 1931, during the Second Spanish Republic, the area was declared an Artistic Historical Monument and opened to the public. The palace, gardens and associated buildings are part of the Aranjuez Cultural Landscape, which was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Cultural Organization in 2001. It is open to the public as one of several Spanish royal sites in the Community of Madrid, Spain. Management is entrusted to the Spanish Patrimonio Nacional, which does not allow private photography of its interior for security reasons. However, licenses may be available for specific purposes upon application. The area around Aranjuez enjoys a mild climate, a verdant and varied landscape with excellent game hunting and has long been inhabited. History In the 12th century the Order of Santiago created an exclusive hunting reserve alongside the river Tagus near its junction with the river Jarama. Its history as a royal site began in the 16th century, when the order's grandmaster Lorenzo I Su√°rez de Figueroa directed the construction of a grand hunting lodge designed for the recreation of members of the order and their royal and noble patrons, known as the Raso de Estrella (Star shaped Glade located between the present Royal Palace and Aranjuez railway station.) The site today is an open festival park. In 1523 Charles I of Spain took possession of the area, which was designated Real Bosque y Casa de Aranjuez (Royal Woods and House of Aranjuez), in order to entertain his guests during the springtime hunting season. In 1551, he established a botanical garden to catalog the newly catalogued species of plants brought from the Americas. Owing to distractions elsewhere, this mission was not entirely successful. Philip II became aware of the fertile meadows of Aranjuez, and designated that a portion of land to the north of the river Tagus should be devoted to pottager and general agriculture in 1561. In an adjacent plot to the south of the river, the King began construction of the first palace, on the same site as the existing building. Philip engaged the services of architect Juan Bautista de Toledo and later Juan de Herrera. They ere also responsible for the palace of The Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo. After Philip's death in 1598, the works were still in progress with only the royal apartments, the chapel, the south tower and part of the western facade completed. An economic and political crisis and the fall of the royal house of Habsburg resulted in the project being abandoned. In 1700, the first Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V, decided to resume the work, intending to make Aranjuez a rival to the grand palace of Versailles. Subsequently, this imposing style would be applied to the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. Philip V added a new north tower, completed the west facade and defined the structure that would shape the current palace. Little used, in the palace was almost destroyed by fire in 1748. Ferdinand VI rebuilt the palace. Although still respecting the original foundations, the new structure was to reflect the prevailing late baroque style and 18th century aesthetic, of an imposing and ostentatious exterior accommodating a series of sumptuously furnished spaces within. The wings enclosing the courtyard were added in the 18th century. The building is mainly due to Charles III in his reforming work for the capital city (he is sometimes called The Mayor of Madrid) and modernization of the Spanish state. The architect of the modern palace was the Italian Francesco Sabatini. He designed the two west wings, which provide the main building enclosing the courtyard, thus defining three sides of the cour d'honneur square that faces the original entrance. It is near the Raso de Estrella at the confluence of the two rivers. At one end of this complex was the chapel and opposite was designated as a theater, although it was never completed. The decoration was enriched in the 18th and 19th centuries with paintings by various artists; in the halls hardwood furniture and several collections of tapestries, clocks, lamps and sculptures were installed. Many of these unique pieces adorn the halls, chambers and spaces. The Sal√≥n de Porcelana was the favorite retreat of Charles III. Charles III took refuge there from Spanish politics for some time following the Esquilache Riots. He chose Aranjuez to be his spring and summer residence at a period of history when the Royal Court used to move from Madrid in the spring and did not return to the capital until October. The King embraced physiocracy (an early form of economics in which the wealth of a nation supposedly lay in its soil and people rather than its treasury). Charles, who enjoyed the palace and its rural environment, established the Cortijo de San Isidro as an experimental farm and divided the palace gardens into the intimate Jard√≠n del Parterre and the wider Jard√≠n de la Isla. He held lavish parties and sometimes sailed along stretches of the Tagus in rich artistically decorated and golden painted Fal√∫as. Charles' son, Charles IV and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma erected a pavilion known as the Casa del Labrador (farmhouse), which is today open to the public and an important example of European Neoclassical architecture. In 1807, Manuel Godoy, favorite of Charles IV's and Spanish prime minister, tried to make peace with Napoleonic France but faced opposition of the rebellious heir to the throne Ferdinand (later called the \\"felon king\\"). Godoy claimed that the kingdom was safe from the impending Napoleonic French invasion because of the treaties he had facilitated. In 1808, while Godoy was a resident in Aranjuez (within the Palace of Osuna) the rumor of invasion spread, resulting in an angry mob led by the rebellious Ferdinand supporters finding him hiding in an attic. He was taken prisoner and later exiled. As a result of the successful Mutiny of Aranjuez in March of that year the palace Sal√≥n del Trono witnessed the abdication of King Charles IV in favor of his son Ferdinand VII, who himself abdicated in May. In September 1808, in a formal ceremony held in the Chapel of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez before Monsignor Don Juan de la Vera, the Archbishop of Laodicea, the Supreme, central Napoleonic Junta was officially constituted. After the Bourbon Restoration, Alfonso XII designated the Royal Palace of Aranjuez to be the residence of the noble household of the Dukes of Montpensier. His bride to be was the daughter of that family, Mercedes of Orl√©ans. In 1878 the bride and her entourage arrived for the ceremony from Madrid at an imposing but temporary railway station constructed near the grand Plaza de Armas (western) entrance to the Palace of Aranjuez. This was the last grand event to be held in Aranjuez, as Maria Christina of Austria the monarch's second wife, his son Alfonso XIII and his wife Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg all preferred the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso for their royal holidays. Design The palace is the centerpiece set of a royal estate. To the north are former potager gardens, now agricultural land intersected by geometric tree-lined \\"royal rides\\" which are now open to the public and mostly pedestrian walkways. To the east are a trident of paved roads (Reina, Principe & Infantas) along which the nobility erected family residences. To the west are a matching trident of rural tracks, one of which was the royal access road lined by barracks (now ruined). Furthest from the palace is an open area, the Raso de Estrella, the site of the original hunting lodge and now a festival ground. The original railway station was also here, before it was relocated further west of the current site. Some of the former railway sidings - now a car park for commuters - are also still discernible. Directly in front of the palace is the oval lawn surrounded by monumental stone benches. The tourist mini-train stop is near there. To the south is the Plaza de Parejas, an open sandy area surrounded by various palace dependencies described below. =Plaza de Parejas= Las parejas reales (an equestrian festival held outside the palace) by Luis Paret y Alc√°zar in 1770. Currently in Museo del Prado. The south of the palace is a large open square known as Plaza de las Parejas in reference to equestrian events formerly held there. (The nobility competed or paraded in pairs or parejas). It is defined on the east by a Renaissance-style two-story building, which was the auxiliary dependence of the palace (Casa de Caballeros y Oficios - now the local law courts and tax offices). To the west a warehouse area, servant halls and (after the fire) a separate kitchen-house (Casa de Fogones). In front - facing the palace (later a hotel) is the Casa del Principe de Paz, intended to be the residence of Manuel Godoy. The palace consists of two floors. The ground level is lit by windows crowned by semicircular arches, while the upper floor opens onto balconies with iron railings. The central body of the palace rises to a third level surmounted by a pediment bearing the shield of Ferdinand VI. At the sides of the shield are engraved two inscriptions. The left one reads \\"Philippus II / Institvit / Philippus V / provexit\\" (initiated by Philip II and continued by Philip V). The right one reads \\" Ferdinandu / VI Pius Felix / Consummavit / An MDCCLII\\" (Completed in 1752 by the faithful and devout Ferdinand VI). = Structure = The entire structure is built in red brick with white limestone details from Colmenar de Oreja. = Entrance = Public access is to the east, via the M-305 road and boat-bridge. For royalty, the traditionally formal access to the Palace is to cross the river Tagus by the (now closed) road to the west near the confluence and then travel eastwards, entering via the Plaza de Armas and through the portico of the central body. The central rise in the elevation of the building is to emphasise the main portico that is framed by five symmetrical exterior arches. On the ledge are statues carved by Pedro Martinengo portraying Philip II, Philip V and Ferdinand VI. On either side of the portico, the wings have three grand terminal arches to further emphasise the grandeur of this royal access. Above the portico is a large balcony with stone parapets overlooking the courtyard. The portico provides access to the interior through a hall that in turn leads to a grand central staircase made by Giacomo Bonav√≠a at the behest of Ferdinand VI. The balustrade is of black iron with gold trim and fits within the Rococo trend. From the ceiling hangs an Empire style large chandelier gilt bronze and crystal from La Granja. =Interior= Behind the palace's main body is an interior courtyard around which are distributed the various halls. In both corners can be seen two small towers surmounted by domes resting on shallow circular drums with small windows that illuminate the interior, in one of which is set a clock. The lobby is decorated with sculptures and on the top floor are three marble busts inside alcoves representing Louis XIV of France, his wife Maria Theresa of Spain and their son Louis, the Grand Dauphin. These busts were made in 1683 by French sculptor Antoine Coysevox. The presence of these three French characters in the palace is explained by the connections to the Spanish Royal Bourbon family with the French monarchy and particularly The Grand Dauphin who was the father of Philip V and his parents, the grandparents of Philip. In almost all halls of are clocks of all sizes and characteristics, as King Charles IV was a collector of clocks and an Horologer. Sal√≥n de Guardias de la Reina (Space for the guards of the Queen)  This salon is decorated with three mural scenes from the life of King Solomon, painted by Italian Luca Giordano. The furniture is of olive wood from the time of King Charles IV, and the clocks are from the collection of Charles IV.

Rebuilt in the time of King Charles IV by Juan de Villanueva. Decorated with stucco, in its walls are frescoes painted around 1791 by Francisco Bayeu y Sub√≠as, who was the brother in law of Francisco de Goya. The subjects represented are Adoration of the Magi, Adoration of the Shepherds, the Flight into Egypt, Visitation and Zechariah and St. Elizabeth with the Virgin Mary. In addition to the pillars that form the frame of the main altar are St. Matthew and St. Luke. In the center of the vault is depicted God the Father with a celestial host of angels. At top of the dome flies the dove of the Holy Spirit. The canvas of the Immaculate Mary occupying the central space is by Mariano Salvador Maella. = Sal√≥n del Trono (Throne Room) = Sal√≥n del Trono The recessed dome is decorated with Pompeian style frescoes attributed to Vicente Camar√≥n in 1851 and represent the Monarchy. The royal crown is supported by figures of Venus and Industry. To the right stands Arts and left Abundance and Prudence. Around the hall runs a stucco base that simulates marble with green serpentine tones. In this hall kings officiated during formal visits. The walls are lined with red velvet. The furniture is mostly from the period of Isabel II, except for the decorative French Louis XVI style royal thrones that were used by Alfonso XII and his wife. =Despacho de la Reina (Queen's office) = This room was used by Isabel II as an office, after it was a bedroom. Paintings decorate its walls, including the Vase by Jan Brueghel. A landscape by Mart√≠nez del Mazo, two paintings of small size with view of classical buildings, painted by Francisco Galli Bibiena, and three vases by Arellano are some other of most interesting. The vault is frescoed in Pompeian style by Mariano Salvador Maella with scenes from the Passion of Christ. Next to this hall is a small chapel or private oratory with a painting of the Virgin by Luca Giordano. The lamp hanging from ceiling is of La Granja de San Ildefonso' glass. The furniture is from the era of Charles IV, built at the Royal Workshop, highlighting in them fine marquetry work. = Gabinete de Porcelana (Porcelain room) = Gabinete de Porcelana This room was commissioned by Charles III. It is a work by the Royal Porcelain Factory of the Buen Retiro in Madrid. A medium-sized hall, its walls and ceilings are completely lined by plaques of white porcelain and reliefs with Rococo decoration of chinoiserie motifs (garlands of flowers, fruits, monkeys, vases, mandarins, parrots, samurais, birds and dragons). The ceramic plaques are attached to timber walls by screws. They were made between 1760 and 1765 by Giuseppe Gricci. The floor is marble. Eight large mirrors against the walls multiply the effect of the decorations. Interspersed with the above-described decoration are human groups in everyday scenes. In the center of the ceiling arises a lamp taking the form of a palm, while a Chinese with a hand fan and a monkey on his shoulders climbs the trunk. The purpose of this room was as a games room and playground. =Dormitorio de la Reina (Queen's bedroom) = The dome is decorated with tempera frescoes by Zacar√≠as Gonz√°lez Vel√°zquez with allegories of Science, Virtue, Art, Law and Monarchy.

The furniture is of late-19th century Isabel II style decoration, but is unrelated to the original furniture, which disappeared in a fire in late-19th century. =Comedor de gala (Formal dining room) = Formerly a debating chamber during the reign of Ferdinand VI, Charles III used it as a banquet hall for gala occasions, as the palace has several less formal dining rooms. It has a vaulted ceiling painted around 1750 by Jacopo Amigoni with a complicated moralizing symbology. The figure of Father Time is surrounded by women who are trying to clip his wings to prevent time flying away. Truth is portrayed as matron of angels while Wisdom pays her homage. The Monarchy is depicted by its positive attributes and virtues (Justice, Religion, Bounty, the Angel of Peace with an olive branch, Faith and Charity as a woman protecting children). There is a series of grisaille representing parts of the world where the Monarchy had its possessions. Occasionally this space was also used as a ballroom. The floor is Rococo style of very good quality, with stucco work by Carlos Antonio Bernasconi, representing military attributes, sheet music and musical instruments. =Dormitorio del Rey (King's bedroom) = The Empire style wooden bed is mahogany with bronze applications.

From the west, one reaches it by hiking an easy 3.5 mile trail from the end of the Cascade River Road (elev. ). From the east, it is accessible via a trail from Stehekin up the Stehekin River valley. The summit of the pass, being at the tree line, is known for its views in all directions. It is also a key departure point for mountaineering; to the north, the gentle ridge of the Sahale arm leads up Sahale Mountain to the summit, as well as to the meadows of Boston Basin and the summits above. To the south, Mixup Arm leads to Mixup Peak and Magic Mountain, as well as to Cache Col, making Cascade Pass the start of the high-level Ptarmigan Traverse. The pass was originally a major route for Native Americans trading between the coast and the interior. Among the first white men to explore and map the Skagit Pass was New York newspaperman Frank Wilkeson. Alexander Ross probably crossed the Cascades via Cascade Pass in 1814.

It is universally celebrated on December 8, nine months before the feast of the Nativity of Mary, which is celebrated on September 8. The Immaculate Conception is one of the most important Marian feasts in the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church, and is celebrated worldwide. By Pontifical designation and decree, it is the patronal feast day of Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Philippines, Spain, the United States, Uruguay and Italy. By royal decree, it is also designated as the Patroness of Portugal. It is celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church as well as a few other closely related Protestant Christian churches, but not by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, and Church of the East. Since 1953, the pope in his capacity as Bishop of Rome visits the Column of the Immaculate Conception in Piazza di Spagna to offer expiatory prayers commemorating the solemn event. The feast was first solemnized as a Holy Day of ObligationClementis XI, Papam - CXX - Mandatur ut Festum Conceptionis beatae Mariae Virginis Immaculatae de praecepto ubique observetur - Commissi Nobis Divinitus sacrosancti apostolatus officii exigit ratio, ut gloriossimae Virginis Dei genitricis Mariae cuius Conceptio gaudium annuciavit universo mundo, venerationem et cultum, plurium Romanorum Pontificum praedecessorum nostrorum more, ampliare studentes in terris, illius, quae super choros angelorum exaltata pro populo Christiano sedula exoratrix apud eum, quem genuit, assidue intercedit in caelis, potentissimam opem in toltantisque, quibus premimur, Christianae reipublicae et Catholicae Ecclesiae necessitatibus, quantum nobis ex alto conceditur, promereri iugiter satagamus.

Fastiggi eds., University Press of America, 2009 and is often celebrated with Mass, parades, fireworks, processions, ethnic foods, and cultural festivities in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary and is generally considered a Family Day, especially in many majority-Catholic countries. History The Eastern Christian Church first celebrated a \\"Feast of the Conception of the Most Holy and All Pure Mother of God\\" on December 9, perhaps as early as the 5th century in Syria. The original title of the feast focused more specifically on Saint Anne, being termed sylepsis tes hagias kai theoprometoros Annas\\" (\\"conception of Saint Anne, the Ancestress of God\\"). By the 7th century, the feast was already widely known in the East. However, when the Eastern Church called Mary achrantos (\\"spotless\\" or \\"immaculate\\"), this was not defined doctrine. The majority of Orthodox Christians do not accept the Scholastic definition of Mary's preservation from original sin before her birth as subsequently defined in the Western Church after the Great Schism of 1054.Timothy Ware (Bishop Kallistos). The Orthodox Church (London: Penguin Books, 1963), pp. 263-264. After the feast was translated to the Western Church in the 8th century, it began to be celebrated on December 8. It spread from the Byzantine area of Southern Italy to Normandy during the period of Norman dominance over southern Italy. From there it spread to England, France, Germany, and eventually Rome.Francis X. Weiser. Handbook of Christian Feasts and Customs (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1958), p. 292. In 1568, Pope Pius V revised the Roman Breviary, and though the Franciscans were allowed to retain the Office and Mass written by Bernardine dei Busti, this office was suppressed for the rest of the Church, and the office of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin was substituted instead, the word \\"Conception\\" being substituted for \\"Nativity.\\"Habig O.F.M., Marion A. \\"Land of Mary Immaculate\\", The American Ecclesiastical Review, June 1954 According to the Papal Bull Commissi Nobis Divinitus, dated 6 December 1708, Pope Clement XI mandated the feast as a Holy Day of Obligation which is to be celebrated in future years by the faithful.Commissi Nobis Divinitus - VI Decembris 1708 - Clementis XI, Papam - Sincera itaque nostra erga eamdem augustissimam caeli reginam, patronam, advocatam, nostram, devotione incitati festum conceptionis ipsius beatae mariae virginis immaculatae ubique terrarum in posterum ab omnibus et singulis utriusque sexus christifidelibus sicut alia festa de praecepto observationis festorum comprehendi auctoritate apostolica, tenore praesentium decernimus praecipimus et mandamus. ...Volumus autem ut earumdem praesentium literrarum transumptis, seu exemplis etiam impressis, manu alicuius notarii publici subscriptis, et sigillo personae in ecclesiastica dignitate constitutae munitis, eadem prorsus fides adhibeatur ipsis praesentibus si forent exhibitae vel ostensae. Furthermore, the pontiff requested that the papal bull be notarized in the Holy See to be further copied and reproduced for dissemination. Prior to Pope Pius IX's definition of the Immaculate Conception as a Roman Catholic dogma in 1854, most missals referred to it as the Feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The festal texts of this period focused more on the action of her conception than on the theological question of her preservation from original sin. A missal published in England in 1806 indicates the same Collect for the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was used for this feast as well. The Roman Missal in English Tr. John England (Philadelphia: Eugene Chummiskey, 1843), p. 529. The first move towards describing Mary's conception as \\"immaculate\\" came in the 11th century. In the 15th century, Pope Sixtus IV, while promoting the festival, explicitly tolerated both the views of those who promoted it as the Immaculate Conception and those who challenged such a description, a position later endorsed by the Council of Trent. The proper for the feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Medieval Sarum Missal merely addresses the fact of her conception. The collect for the feast reads: > O God, mercifully hear the supplication of thy servants who are assembled > together on the Conception of the Virgin Mother of God, may at her > intercession be delivered by Thee from dangers which beset us.The Sarum > Missal in English Tr. A. Harford Pearson (London: The Church Printing Co., > 1834), p. 332. In 1854, Pius IX issued the Apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus: \\"The most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instant of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin.\\"Ineffabilis Deus the Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius IX on the Immaculate Conception (December 8, 1854), in the Acta Pii IX, pars 1, Vol. 1, p. 615. This marked no actual change in doctrine, but rather marked the first instance of formal definition of the dogma. According to the Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 5, when the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, which always occurs within Advent, falls on a Sunday, it is transferred to the following Monday.Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar (In some countries, including the United States, the obligation to attend Mass does not transfer.)Edward McNamara, \\"Feast of the Immaculate Conception\\", ZENIT, 17 December 2013. The 1960 Code of Rubrics, still observed by some in accordance with Summorum Pontificum, gives the feast of the Immaculate Conception preference even over an Advent Sunday.Code of Rubrics, 15 Cultural influence The celebration of La Griteria in Leon, Nicaragua A modern statue of the Immaculate Conception atop a public square in the main street of Ko≈°ice, Slovakia The solemnity is an official public holiday in the following sovereign countries and territories: * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * ' * In Nicaragua, the solemnity is celebrated with local parades and religious processions. * In Panama, it is considered Mother's day * In Spain, since 1760, the day is marked as a national holiday as designated by Pope Clement XIII. * In Italy, it is a national holiday while since 1953, the Pope in his capacity as Bishop of Rome visits the Column of the Immaculate Conception in Piazza di Spagna to offer expiatory prayers commemorating the solemn event.

Blue liturgical vestments The belief is solemnly celebrated in many countries and has inspired much sacred artwork. The Immaculate Conception, by Pedro de Sierra, (c. 1735) Valladolid, Spain. The Holy See, through the Sacred Congregation of Rites grants the express privilege to use blue or cerulean vestments on this day for the Spanish crown and its former territories. Numerous pontiffs have expressed the same sentiment via a Pontifical decree, namely the following: * Pope Pius VII granted the express privilege to permit blue vestments to the Archdiocese of Seville on 28 November 1819. * Pope Pius IX granted to the Primate of Spain on 8 December 1854 within the Archdiocese of Toledo. The same privilege of allowing blue vestments for Cuba on 5 May 1862. Ultimately, he clarified the privilege extended to all Spanish colonies on a decree dated 12 February 1864. * Pope Leo XIII accorded the privilege of blue vestments for Peru on a papal document dated 25 September 1891. The Catholic leadership in Chile also makes the same claim to this privilege. * Pope Pius X reiterated this sentiment for both former and present territories of Spain via a pontifical decree on 7 September 1903. The same Pontiff issued a papal bull retaining the privilege for the Philippines to use blue vestments on 11 February 1910. The bull was signed and executed by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNNdG4ekfY Several petitions were submitted to the Holy See to use blue or violet vestments for other Marian feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is considered an ecclesiastical abuse by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and ruled against it on 23 February 1839. Anglican Communion In the Church of England, the \\"Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" may be observed as a Lesser Festival on 8 December. The situation in other constituent churches of the Anglican Communion is similar, i.e., as a lesser commemoration. Many Anglo-Catholic parishes observe the feast using the traditional Roman Catholic title, the \\"Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\". Eastern Orthodoxy While the Eastern Orthodox Churches have never accepted the Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception, they do celebrate December 9 as the Feast of the Conception by St. Anne of the Most Holy Theotokos. While the Orthodox believe that the Virgin Mary was, from her conception, filled with every grace of the Holy Spirit, in view of her calling as the Mother of God, they do not teach that she was conceived without original sin as their understanding and terminology of the doctrine of original sin differs from the Roman Catholic articulation.Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church (Penguin Books, 1963, ), pp. 263-4. The Orthodox do, however, affirm that Mary is \\"all-holy\\" and never committed a personal sin during her lifetime. The Orthodox feast is not a perfect nine months before the feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos (September 8) as it is in the West, but a day later. This feast is not ranked among the Great Feasts of the church year, but is a lesser-ranking feast (Polyeleos).

They emerged in the late 1960s delivering comedic commentary on the news for the Los Angeles AM rock radio station KRLA 1110, and proceeded to develop more elaborate and ambitious satirical routines on the \\"underground\\" station KPPC-FM in Pasadena, California. Founded as a loose collective centered on KRLA staff members Lew Irwin, John Gilliland, Thom Beck, Richard Beebe, and folk singer Len Chandler, the group is chiefly remembered today for its 1971‚Äì79 lineup, comprising Beebe, Harry Shearer, David L. Lander and Michael McKean. Lew Irwin and The Credibility Gap with (left to right) John Gilliland, Thom Beck, Len Chandler, Richard Beebe, and Lew Irwin from An Album of Political Pornography  History  = Lew Irwin and The Credibility Gap = The Credibility Gap grew out of a company formed by Lew Irwin and Cliff Vaughs. Alt URL KRLA 1110 hired news director Irwin to form The Credibility Gap in 1968 with his radio colleagues John Gilliland, Thom Beck, Richard Beebe, and folk singer Len Chandler. They took their name from the Vietnam-era term \\"credibility gap\\" (a euphemism for political dishonesty), and broadcast their comedy along with the news on KRLA. They first aired on the date of the 1968 California Primary. In 1968 (billed as \\"Lew Irwin and The Credibility Gap\\") they released An Album Of Political Pornography for Blue Thumb, consisting of highlights from their radio sketches. Thom Beck left in late 1968, and was replaced by Harry Shearer. Lew Irwin left a few months later, replaced by David L. Lander in February, 1969. = The Credibility Gap = The Credibility Gap with (left to right) Harry Shearer, David L. Lander and Michael McKean from A Great Gift Idea. Not pictured: Richard Beebe. In 1969, The Credibility Gap performed on KRLA's Pop Chronicles music documentary. By this point, Gilliland and Chandler had left, to be replaced by Bob Goodwin. This left Beebe the only original member remaining, and as the professional radio newsmen left, the Credibility Gap came to be dominated by comedians. Goodman stayed with the group for about a year, but by late 1970, the Credibility Gap consisted of Beebe, Shearer and Lander. KRLA dropped The Credibility Gap's show in 1970, but Shearer found work as a disc jockey on freeform station KPPC and The Credibility Gap continued their on-air performances there. In 1971, the trio released the album Woodschtick, consisting of two long pieces that were somewhat in the style of The Firesign Theatre. Also writing and performing on the album was Michael McKean, who would be promoted to full membership after the album's release. Guest performers Christopher Ross, Morgan Upton and Albert Brooks would also work with the group during this era. Mark Deming writes of this transition: > [I]n late 1968, Thom Beck left the group, and Lew Irwin followed in early > 1969 ... . Joining the Credibility Gap in their absence were Harry Shearer > ... and David L. Lander... . By 1970, Len Chandler and John Gilliland had > drifted away from the Credibility Gap, and ...

KPPC-FM fired all of its airstaff, including the members of The Credibility Gap, as part of a mass format change in 1971. No longer radio regulars, the group started performing in various clubs and concert venues.Club Review: Credibility Gap, Buchanan at Roxy They also returned to the studio in 1972 to record a promo-only single for Warner Brothers, a four-and-a-half minute mini mock-rock opera called \\"Something For Mary\\". The Credibility Gap followed up this recording with the 1974 album A Great Gift Idea, which mixed satirical sketches with musical parodies. McKean and Shearer played guitar and keyboards, respectively, on the album, augmented by members of the band Little Feat. Beebe left the Gap in 1975. The Credibility Gap continued as an entity through 1979, but after 1976 individual members tended to focus on other projects and the group itself made only sporadic, widely spaced appearances. Beebe remained in radio news; McKean and Lander landed roles on the television series Laverne & Shirley that lasted from 1976 through 1983; and Shearer worked as a consultant for the TV series Fernwood 2-Night, as well as co- writing comedy albums and the 1979 feature film Real Life with Albert Brooks. The Credibility Gap issued a single (\\"The Day The Lights Stayed On In Pittsburgh\\") in 1977, and (without Beebe) continued their New Year's Day Rose Parade broadcasts annually through January 1, 1979; highlights of these broadcasts were collected on the 1979 album Floats. As well, selections from their earlier radio material were compiled on 1977's The Bronze Age of Radio. Shearer became a writer/performer on Saturday Night Live in September, 1979. This necessitated Shearer's move to New York and essentially brought The Credibility Gap's activities to a close. = After The Credibility Gap = The group disbanded in 1979, but the members have had occasion to work together since‚Äînotably the pairings of McKean and Lander as Lenny and Squiggy on the situation comedy Laverne & Shirley (recording an album in character as \\"Lenny and the Squigtones\\") and Shearer and McKean as members of the mock-rock band Spinal Tap.

On 29 September 1970, VA-37 participated in an air power demonstration for President Richard Nixon during his two-day visit to USS Saratoga while she steamed in the Mediterranean. From June to October 1971, VA-37 participated in the test and evaluation of the new CV concept during USS Saratogas deployment to the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The CV concept involved combining the capabilities of the attack and antisubmarine carriers (CVA and CVS) into a single ship. The squadron deployed twice to Yankee Station in support of combat operations during the Vietnam War. On 1 August 1972, a squadron A-7A was used to establish a sonobuoy field in an anchorage area near the island of Hon Nieu, off the coast of North Vietnam - the first time an A-7 had ever been used to drop sonobuoys. In 1973, the squadron received their first A-7E, a more advanced version of the plane. They made seven cruises with this plane in the 1970s and early 1980s, including responding to regional crises in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. =1980s= On 4 January , with VA-37 embarked as part of Carrier Air Wing Three, deployed from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia for a seven-month cruise that saw USS John F.

During their time operating in the Arabian Sea, VA-37 and USS John F. Kennedy conducted port visits at Perth, Australia and Mombasa, Kenya, before, in June 1982, taking station off the coast of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion. After leaving the area another port visit took place in Toulon, France, before returning home on 14 July 1982. From 1 October 1982 VA-37 became part of Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) and in January 1983 as part of CVW-15 they embarked on board the then newest Navy carrier, . VA-37 headed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico in August 1942 for exercises with the destroyer , which was the test platform for the development of the CG/SM-2 (ER) missile program project. On 1 March VA-37 sailed with CVW-15 and USS Carl Vinson on an eight-month would cruise that saw them operate in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, South China Sea, and Pacific Ocean in a multitude of exercises and with port visits in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Casablanca, Morocco, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Perth, Australia, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, Sasebo, Japan, Pusan, Republic of Korea, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before returning to NAS Cecil Field in Florida on 29 October 1983. In June 1984, the squadron's primary mission was changed to close air support in preparation for its deployment to MCAS Iwakuni as part of the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program. The deployment of the two Navy attack squadrons was designed to test the interoperability of the Marine Corps and Navy. In December 1984, VA-37 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni and relieved VA-105. While deployed to Iwakuni, the squadron was detached to Yechon, Korea, to participate in exercise Team Spirit 85. This was the first time a Navy carrier-based squadron had deployed in field conditions since World War II. In April 1988, VA-37 deployed with Carrier Air Wing Six (CVW-6) on board to the North Arabian Sea via the Suez Canal in support of Operation Earnest Will.

Kennedy, , , and . Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, several squadron aircraft were deployed with VA-72 in support of Operation Desert Shield. On 31 October 1990, the squadron flew their last official sortie in the A-7E Corsair II. This ended a 25-year association in which over 115,000 flight hours and 25,000 arrestments were flown. On 28 November 1990, VA-37 was redesignated Strike Fight Squadron Thirty Seven (VFA-37) and began flying the F/A-18 Hornet. From October 1992 to April 1993, VFA-37 deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and participated in Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq and Operation Provide Promise in the airspace near the former Yugoslavia. In 1994 the squadron flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and later over Bosnia in support of Operation Deny Flight. The squadron also participated in major exercises with the Kuwaitis, Saudis, and Israelis, as well as with many NATO allies. In November 1996, the squadron flew in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Deliberate Guard over Bosnia- Herzegovina. VFA-37 deployed again in November 1998. After four weeks of participating in OSW, the order was issued for Operation Desert Fox in Iraq. They also flew missions over the former Yugoslavia in Operation Deliberate Force. The squadron relocated from Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, to NAS Oceana, Virginia in July 1999. =21st century= The next major deployment for VFA-37 was the maiden voyage of in 2000. In December 2002 VFA-37 deployed for their second cruise aboard Harry S. Truman. On 19 March 2003, the squadron participated in combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). While flying from the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the squadron participated in the \\"shock and awe\\" campaign in Southern Iraq before shifting focus to assisting U.S. Forces in Northern Iraq.

Biography Schwanthaler was born in Munich. His family had been sculptors in Tyrol and Innviertel for three centuries; young Ludwig received his earliest lessons from his father, Franz Schwanthaler (1762‚Äì1820), and the father had been instructed by the grandfather. The last to bear the name was Xaver, who worked in his cousin Ludwig's studio and survived till 1854. For successive generations the family lived by the carving of busts and sepulchral monuments, and from the condition of craftsmen rose to that of artists. From the Munich Gymnasium Schwanthaler passed as a student to the Munich Academy; at first he purposed to be a painter, but afterwards reverted to the sculptural arts of his ancestors. His talents received timely encouragement by a commission for an elaborate silver service for the king's table. Peter von Cornelius also befriended him; the great painter was occupied on designs for the decoration in fresco of the newly erected Glyptothek, and at his suggestion Schwanthaler was employed on the sculpture within the halls. Thus arose between painting, sculpture, and architecture that union and mutual support which characterized the revival of the arts in Bavaria. Schwanthaler in 1826 went as a pensioner of the king to Rome, where he carried out a number of commissions, and on a second visit in 1832 Bertel Thorvaldsen gave him kindly help. His skill was so developed that on his return he was able to meet the extraordinary demand for sculpture occasioned by King Ludwig's passion for building new palaces, churches, galleries,and museums, and he became the fellow-worker of the architects Leo von Klenze, Friedrich von Gartner and Joseph Daniel Ohlm√ºller, and of the painters Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld and Karl Hess. Owing to the magnitude and multitude of the sculptural commissions they turned out, over- pressure and haste in design and workmanship brought down the quality of the art. The works of Schwanthaler in Munich are so many and miscellaneous that they can only be briefly indicated. The Neues Palais is peopled with his statues: the throne-room has twelve imposing gilt bronze figures 10 feet high; the same palace is also enriched with a frieze and with sundry other decorations modelled and painted from his drawings. The sculptor, like his contemporary painters, received help from trained pupils, one of whom, Anton Dominik Fernkorn, went on to have a very successful career in Vienna. The same prolific artist also furnished Munich's Alte Pinakothek with twenty-five marbles commemorating great painters; likewise he supplied a composition for the pediment of the exhibition building facing the Glyptothek, and executed sundry figures for the public library and the hall of the marshals. Sacred art lay outside his ordinary routine, yet in the churches of St Ludwig and St Mariahilf he gave proof of the widest versatility. The Ruhmeshalle afforded further gauge of unexampled power of production; here alone is work which, if adequately studied, might have occupied a lifetime; ninety-two metopes, and, conspicuously, the colossal but feeble figure of Bavaria, 60 ft. high, rank among the boldest experiments. A short life of forty-six years did not permit serious undertakings beyond the Bavarian capital, yet time was found for the groups within the north pediment of the Walhalla, Regensburg, and also for numerous portrait statues, including those of Mozart, Jean Paul, Goethe and Shakespeare. Schwanthaler died in Munich in 1848, and willed to the Munich Academy all his models and studies, which formed the Schwanthaler Museum. He is buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof in Munich.

The population in 2011 was 1,239,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat History During the settlement of the island (between the 15th and 16th century), the region of Feteiras was a frontier area, between various jurisdictions, including captaincies and municipalities. The first settlement was the ecclesiastical parish of Santa Ana da Porta Alegre, created by the first colonists to venture east of Pico da D. Joana, and later, when that settlement lost its influence, it was absorbed into the parish of Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o. With the restructuring of parishes and municipalities, that resulted in a densification of settlements during the first half of the 16th century, the region was integrated into the parish of S√£o Pedro da Ribeirinha, until it became an independent parish on 30 November 1906. During the captaincy period, delimited in 1474 between Angra and Praia, the southern coast was fixed at the old geodesic mark, that followed the eastern edge of the volcanic tailings in Feteira. That way, the limit coincided with the parish of Ribeirinha (until 1906) and the territory was part of Angra. Many of the references to Marco refers to the diverse points in the parish, that marked and demarcated the captaincy's boundaries. This situation changed in 1565, when experienced geographers through a 1565 accord of the Tribunal da Rela√ß√£o da Corte (who had long opposed the Donatary-Captains Ant√£o Martins and Manuel Corte- Real),Francisco Ferreira Drummond, Anais da Ilha Terceira, vol. I., Segunda √âpoca, Cap. V. advanced the boundary to the west, to follow the actual Canada do Marco. The final demarkation was concluded on 8 July 1565, and put an end to quarrels that had been raging since 1525, over the limits of Altares.Francisco Ferreira Drummond, Anais da Ilha Terceira, vol. I., Segunda √âpoca, Cap. V. By consequence, the eastern edge of the parish, between Canada dos Cl√©rigos and Canada do Marco, that included the Ponta Nova bridge, became the responsibility of the Captaincy of Praia, while the eastern frontier, from Canada do Marco until Ladeira Grande, became part of the captaincy of Angra.Rute Dias Greg√≥rio, Terra e Fortuna: os prim√≥rdios da humaniza√ß√£o da ilha Terceira (1450?-1550). Ponta Delgada, Centro de Hist√≥ria de Al√©m-mar, 2008 (). Yet, this decision was not peaceful, and required the intervention of the Crown, who established a geodesic mark along Canada do Marco. The parish of Ribeirinha was part of the city of Angra,Francisco Ferreira Drummond, op. cit., vol. I., cap. IV. and by extension, a curato of the parish of S√£o Sebasti√£o.Pedro de Merelim, As 18 par√≥quias de Angra (The 18 Parishes of Angra). Angra do Hero√≠smo, 1974. By 1568, the parish of S√£o Pedro da Ribeirinha was already created, and included the territory of Feteira. In this context, when they structured the municipalities of Terceira, the limit of Ribeirinha, which extended to the edge of the volcanic fields of Feteira, began to be the border between Angra and S√£o Sebasti√£o. The area east of the volcanic fields, between Canada do Marco and the parish limits, was part of the region of Porto Judeu (and by extension the municipality of Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o). This explains the successive changes east of the parish, that occurred between 1911 and 1928. Located on the peripheral area, with little potable water, the settlement was late in developing and, then, slow to grow. The original settlement developed from the small nuclei that sprang around the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s, a small temple constructed at the top of Caminho das Vinhas. Yet, at the beginning of the 18th century, two centuries and a half after its settlement, only included six permanent residences. That hermitage, which maintained its architectural design, was constructed in 1590, through the initiative of Father Manuel Martins Coelho Bai√£o, then vicar of the parish of Ribeirinha, whose territory included Feteira. The locality included few residents, and the priest constructed the hermitage at his own expense, to celebrated mass during the period of grape cultivation and winemaking, and included an improvised building so that the priest could overnight during the harvest. The selection of the invocation, to Our Lady of Mercy, originated in Spain, and was popularized by the monks of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, founded by S√£o Pedro Nolasco. The image was considered a protector of captive Christians in North Africa, and specifically to those captured by Saracen raiders. The invocation was also a patron of various brotherhoods, formed by slaves, who considered the image as vestige of liberation.Augusto de Lima J√∫nior, Hist√≥ria de Nossa Senhora em Minas Gerais: origens das principais invoca√ß√µes. Belo Horizonte: Editora Aut√™ntica, 2008, p. 117. Without any consistent source of potable water, the area continued to be sparsely populated until the beginning of the 19th century, when the expansion of cistern construction, growth in the winemaking industry and the opening of the Royal Roadway facilities the settlement of families and the place began to take on a life of its own. At this time, the hermitage, which became the property of the Toste Parreira family, became the centre of village life and embryo for the parish of Feteira. On 10 September 1863 Feteira was elevated to the status of suffrage of the parish of S√£o Pedro da Ribeirinha, transforming the small hermitage into local cult. At the time there were 300 permanent inhabitants. It first cura was Father Domingos Correia de √Åvila. The hermitage, which was owned by In√°cio Toste Parreira, was too small install the Holy Sacrament, meaning the parish of Ribeirinha still retained its importance. As a consequence, after its elevation, there was an upswell of interest in constructing a new church of adequate dimensions, therein the intention to expand the hermitage. Yet, the propertyowner opposed the idea, and did not cede any land for its construction. Following his obstruction, the townsfolk decided to construct the new temple along the Royal Road linking Angra and Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o, along the Caminho das Vinhas (today Canada das Merc√™s). As a consequence of this decision, the new Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola√ß√£o was inaugurated in 1868, and the hermitage began to be the responsibility of its propertyowners. The change in patron came from In√°cio Toste Parreira, who did not permit the transference of the image of Our Lady of Mercy to the new church. At the time of its inauguration, therefore, Maria Lu√≠sa Guedes Sampaio (widow of Diogo Labatt) donated the image of Our Lady of Consolation. Consequently, the church obtain its patron, while the ecclesiastical parish retained the Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s, since the Vatican did not authorize the change. The Church of Nossa Senhora da Consola√ß√£o was officially inaugurated on 20 May 1968, but had to be repaired after damage from the 1980 earthquake. There were approximately 403 homes in 1991. Geography A view of the southern border of Feteria at the beach of the same name The rural parish is located from the municipal seat of Angra do Hero√≠smo. The geographic limits of the parish include the parish of Porto Judeu (to the east), Ribeirinha (to the north and west), while it fronts the Atlantic Ocean (to the south). It contains the localities Faj√£ da Lajinha, Feteira, Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa, Nossa Senhora dos Merc√™s, Outeiro and Serretinha. Although the population has decreased, current statistics indicate a leveling of out-migration. Architecture The traditional architecture of Doze Ribeiras resembles much of the rural homes of the western Terceira region, generally constructed around a single floor, many white-washed homes, bordered by multi-coloured trim at the corners, doors and windows. * Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s () * Church of Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s () * Imp√©rio of the Holy Spirit of Ponta Nova do Parada ) * Imp√©rio of the Holy Spirit of Canada dos Vinhais References Category:Parishes of Angra do Hero√≠smo ","title":"Feteira (Angra do Hero√≠smo)"},{"id":"1257320","text":"Alexsandro Fernandes XavierBio at Brazilian FA Database (born April 4, 1973 in Recife, Brazil), often known simply as Alex Fernandes, is a former Brazilian football striker.

In that season CF Monterrey, managed by Daniel Passarella, won the Clausura 2003 Championship, and Alex, as well as his teammates, played a key role in the team through the whole season. However, his form dipped in 2004, as he only made nine appearances in the 2004 Clausura, scoring six goals, and only four in the 2004 Apertura, scoring none. In the Clausura 2005, Alex participation again diminished because of several injuries, but by the Apertura 2005 he was ready to reappear and his goals along with Guillermo Franco's led the team to the Finals. Although he didn't play the Finale against Toluca, because of an injury during the Semifinals against archirival Tigres, Alex is widely recognized as being part of the team's success and effectiveness during that season.Llega Monterrey a 8 juegos sin perder by ESPN DeportesSe impone CF Monterrey by ESPN Deportes This would be Alex's last tournament until the Apertura 2007 when, after a break from the soccer fields, he returned to CF Monterrey with renewed expectations and hoping to exceed the effectiveness he achieved along with former teammate Guillermo Franco.

The second-highest peak on the mountain (Pointe Whymper, 4,184 m; 13,727 ft) was first climbed by Edward Whymper, Christian Almer, Michel Croz and Franz Biner on 24 June 1865, using what has become the normal route of ascent and the one followed by Walker's party in 1868.

One of the most famous walls in the Alps, it towers 1200 m (3,900 ft) above the Leschaux Glacier, stretching 1 km from end to end. The classic route on the face is the Walker Spur (Cassin/Esposito/Tizzoni, 1938, TD+/ED1, IV, 5c/6a, A1, 1200 m) which leads directly to the summit of Pointe Walker. The other major buttress on the mountain is the Croz Spur, which leads to the summit of Pointe Croz. In her solo ascents of the six most difficult north faces of the Alps, Alison Hargreaves chose this route in preference to the Walker Spur. Reinhold Messner has stated, that he made the decision to ascend Mount Everest with Peter Habeler in the Grandes Jorasses, where Peter \\"descended like a dancer\\". South face On the Italian side of the mountain, the south face can be accessed from the Boccalatte cabin, above the hamlet of Planpincieux in the Italian Val Ferret, part of the Courmayeur municipality.

Its music touches on elements of hardcore punk and metal. The writer Patrick Kennedy wrote, \\"While developing the blueprint for noise-metal bands to follow, Unsane cut a remarkable swath through underground music, inspiring a devoted, cult-like following around the world.\\" Biography In 1988, the singer/guitarist Chris Spencer, bass guitarist Pete Shore and drummer Charlie Ondras were students at Sarah Lawrence College when they formed Lawn-Chair- Blisters before changing the name to Unsane. The band signed to Circuit Records and recorded tracks with Wharton Tiers for what was supposed to be their first album Improvised Munitions, but the label did not release it. Unsane became part of the scene of loud, noisy, like-minded rock groups in New York City's East Village in the early 1990s. They often played gigs with bands like Pussy Galore, Cop Shoot Cop, Surgery, Helmet and the Reverb Motherfuckers. Members of Unsane also played in other bands such as Boss Hog and the Action Swingers. The band's first album, Unsane, was released in 1991 and was known for its harsh music and gruesome cover art with a photo of a decapitated man on a New York subway track wearing a Members Only jacket. The band obtained this photograph from a friend who was working at the time with the police department, which was investigating the scene of the accident. In 1992, Ondras died of a heroin overdose and was replaced by Vincent Signorelli (formerly of Foetus and Swans). In 1994, Shore left the band for unknown reasons and was replaced by Dave Curran. The band toured heavily, and released Total Destruction in 1993 on Matador Records/Atlantic Records. Their third album, Scattered, Smothered & Covered, was issued by Amphetamine Reptile in 1995. The music video for the song \\"Scrape\\", made for a mere $200, had significant play on MTV. The video alternates between lo-fi rehearsal footage of Unsane and a series of serious skateboarding wipeouts. The band continued touring heavily (including a spell opening for Slayer). Their next album, Occupational Hazard, was released by Relapse Records in 1998. Later that same year, seemingly fulfilling of the album's title, Spencer was attacked by four people after playing a concert in Vienna, Austria. He was hospitalized with internal bleeding and underwent major surgery. As a result of his injury, and having toured over ten months of the year, the band decided to take a long break in 2000. Unsane regrouped in 2003 and released the CD/DVD compilation Lambhouse: The Collection 1991-1998 the same year. This was followed by their fifth album, Blood Run, in 2005. Ipecac released the band's sixth studio album, Visqueen, in 2007. Their song \\"Committed\\" was used in the Activision/Neversoft video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Another Activision title, True Crime: New York City, uses the song \\"D Train\\". Unsane released their seventh album Wreck on March 20, 2012, and toured with Melvins in April and May that year. Unsane released their eighth studio album Sterilize on September 29, 2017. In 2019, Spencer announced the formation of a new band, Human Impact, with ex-Swans members Phil Pulel and Chris Pravdica. Spencer subsequently announced his departure from Unsane in August 2019, first in an interview about Human Impact with the Italian-language music zine Equilibrio Precario, and then in English in a comment on a Facebook post of the same article. Activities outside the band During the band's break between 2000 and 2003, Spencer moved to California where he formed a new band with Curran called The Cutthroats 9 and released an album on Man's Ruin Records. Curran formed J.J. Paradise Players Club and Signorelli opened a tattoo shop in Middle Village Queens. Signorelli later formed A Storm of Light with Josh Graham (Neurosis, ex-Red Sparowes, Battle of Mice, Blood and Time) on guitar and vocals, Domenic Seita (ex-Tombs and Asea) on bass guitar, and Pete Angevine (Satanized) on additional drums and percussion. A Storm of Light spent most of the spring touring with Neurosis and they released their first album in 2008. In 2008, Spencer formed the band Celan with Ari Benjamin Meyers (Redux Orchestra), Niko Wenner (Oxbow), Roeder (flu-ID), and Xavi (flu-ID) and, in 2009, they released the well-reviewed album Halo on the Berlin label Exile on Mainstream Records and toured Europe.

The only first-hand accounts of him that survive are in three of Plato's dialogues: the Theaetetus, the Sophist, and the Statesman. In the former dialogue, he posits a mathematical theorem now known as the Spiral of Theodorus. Life Little is known of Theodorus' biography beyond what can be inferred from Plato's dialogues. He was born in the northern African colony of Cyrene, and apparently taught both there and in Athens. He complains of old age in the Theaetetus, the dramatic date of 399 BC of which suggests his period of flourishing to have occurred in the mid-5th century. The text also associates him with the sophist Protagoras, with whom he claims to have studied before turning to geometry.c.f. Plato, Theaetetus, 189a A dubious tradition repeated among ancient biographers like Diogenes La√´rtiusDiogenes La√´rtius 3.6 held that Plato later studied with him in Cyrene, Libya. Work in mathematics Theodorus' work is known through a sole theorem, which is delivered in the literary context of the Theaetetus and has been argued alternately to be historically accurate or fictional. In the text, his student Theaetetus attributes to him the theorem that the square roots of the non- square numbers up to 17 are irrational: > Theodorus here was drawing some figures for us in illustration of roots, > showing that squares containing three square feet and five square feet are > not commensurable in length with the unit of the foot, and so, selecting > each one in its turn up to the square containing seventeen square feet and > at that he stopped. (The square containing two square units is not mentioned, perhaps because the incommensurability of its side with the unit was already known.) Theodorus's method of proof is not known. It is not even known whether, in the quoted passage, \\"up to\\" (ŒºŒ≠œáœÅŒπ) means that seventeen is included. If seventeen is excluded, then Theodorus's proof may have relied merely on considering whether numbers are even or odd. Indeed, Hardy and Wright and Knorr suggest proofs that rely ultimately on the following theorem: If x^2=ny^2 is soluble in integers, and n is odd, then n must be congruent to 1 modulo 8 (since x and y can be assumed odd, so their squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8). A possibility suggested earlier by Zeuthen is that Theodorus applied the so- called Euclidean algorithm, formulated in Proposition X.2 of the Elements as a test for incommensurability. In modern terms, the theorem is that a real number with an infinite continued fraction expansion is irrational. Irrational square roots have periodic expansions. The period of the square root of 19 has length 6, which is greater than the period of the square root of any smaller number. The period of ‚àö17 has length one (so does ‚àö18; but the irrationality of ‚àö18 follows from that of ‚àö2). The so-called Spiral of Theodorus is composed of contiguous right triangles with hypotenuse lengths equal ‚àö2, ‚àö3, ‚àö4, ‚Ä¶, ‚àö17; additional triangles cause the diagram to overlap. Philip J. Davis interpolated the vertices of the spiral to get a continuous curve. He discusses the history of attempts to determine Theodorus' method in his book Spirals: From Theodorus to Chaos, and makes brief references to the matter in his fictional Thomas Gray series. Spiral of Theodorus That Theaetetus established a more general theory of irrationals, whereby square roots of non- square numbers are irrational, is suggested in the eponymous Platonic dialogue as well as commentary on, and scholia to, the Elements.

Japanese commentators predicted that Koreans would easily assimilate into the Japanese Empire. In 1965, the Treaty of Basic Relations between South Korea and Japan confirmed this treaty is \\"already null and void\\".Hook, Glenn D. (2001). History The treaty was proclaimed to the public (and became effective) on August 29, 1910, officially starting the period of Japanese rule in Korea. The treaty had eight articles, the first being: \\"His Majesty the Emperor of Korea makes the complete and permanent cession to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan of all rights of sovereignty over the whole of Korea\\". Gojong of the Korean Empire later called the treaty a neugyak (). The alternative term used in lieu of joyak () implies the treaty was coerced to Koreans by Japanese. Gyeongsul Gukchi (, National humiliation of the year of Gyeongsul)\\" and Gukchi-il (, National humiliation day)\\" are alternative terms for the year and date the treaty was signed, respectively. The United Kingdom had already acquiesced to the annexation of Korea by Japan, via the British connection to Imperial Japan via the Anglo- Japanese Alliance of 1902; and the United States had also sanctioned the annexation, as per the Taft-Katsura Agreement. Legality The legality of the treaty was later disputed by the exiled Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, as well as the South Korean government. While the treaty was affixed with the national seal of the Korean Empire, Emperor Sunjong of Korea refused to sign the treaty as required under Korean law. The treaty was instead signed by Prime Minister Ye Wanyong of the Korean Empire, and Resident General Count Terauchi Masatake of the Empire of Japan. This issue caused considerable difficulty in negotiating the establishment of basic diplomatic relations between the countries. Korea insisted on including a chapter stipulating, \\"The treaty was null and void\\", although Japanese government did not confirm the illegality. Japanese government insisted the treaty was null and void in 1965. A compromise was reached in language of Article II of the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations: \\"It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910, are already null and void.\\" = Conference to discuss legality of the treaty = In January, April, and November 2001, an academic conference on the legality of Japan's annexation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 (titled A reconsideration of Japanese Annexation of Korea from the Historical and International Law Perspectives) was held at Harvard University with the support of the Korea Foundation. Scholars of history and international law participated from South Korea, North Korea, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada. Anthony Carty, a professor at the University of Derby, stated, \\"During the height of the imperialism, it is difficult to find an international law sufficient to determine the legality/illegality of a particular treaty.\\" According to the Asian Yearbook of International Law, in his book on international law, \\"Carty prefers seeing the relationship between Japan and Korea at the time with reference to the reality of the then international community dominated by Western powers, rather than viewing it in terms of treaty law as argued by Korean scholars\\". Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut, discussed Nitobe Inaz≈ç's science of colonial policy. She is the author of Japan's Colonization of Korea: Discourse and Power in which she discusses how Japanese policymakers carefully studied and then invoked international law to annex Korea legally. According to Kan Kimura, a major result of this conference is that the Korean claim that the annexation was illegal was rejected by the participating Western scholars, as well as others specializing in international law. Activism On August 28, 2007, regarding the General Power of Attorney by Sunjong, Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo reported that Korean monarchs did not sign in the official documents with their real names, traditionally, but the Korean Emperor was forced by Japan to follow a new custom to sign with his real name, which originated from the Western Hemisphere. It mentioned Sunjong's signature may be compulsory. On June 23, 2010, 75 South Korean congressmen suggested the legal nullification of the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty to the Prime Minister Naoto Kan. On July 6, 2010, Korean and Japanese progressive Christian groups gathered in Tokyo's Korean YMCA chapter and jointly declared that the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty was unjustified. On July 28, 2010, around 1000 intellectuals in Korea and Japan issued a joint statement that the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty was never valid in the first place.

The river starts with the confluence of the North Fork Skykomish River and South Fork Skykomish River approximately one mile west of Index, then flowing northwesterly towards Puget Sound. It is joined by the Sultan River and the Wallace River at Sultan. It then meets the Snoqualmie River to form the Snohomish River at Monroe. The Snohomish River continues along the river valley eventually dumping into Port Gardner Bay on Possession Sound (part of Puget Sound). The Skykomish River's main stem is long. The length including its headwater tributaries, South Fork Skykomish and Tye River, is . ArcExplorer GIS data viewer. The Skykomish's drainage basin is in area. ArcExplorer GIS data viewer. U.S. Highway 2 and the BNSF Railway are routed to follow the Skykomish River, South Fork Skykomish, and Tye River to Stevens Pass and the Cascade Tunnel. The Skykomish is sometimes referred to by the nickname \\"Sky River\\" or \\"The Sky\\". According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the South Fork is about twice the size of the North Fork in terms of both discharge and watershed area above their confluence at Index, making it the true hydrologic source of the Skykomish River. The South Fork average flow of is sourced from a drainage area of , compared to the North Fork which has an average flow of from a drainage area of . In turn the source of the South Fork ‚Äì in terms of streamflow ‚Äì is the Rapid River, a tributary of the Beckler River, which in turn is a tributary of the South Fork Skykomish. The name \\"Skykomish\\" comes from the Northern Lushootseed word /sq'√≠x ∑…ôb≈°/, meaning \\"upriver people\\", from /q'√≠x ∑/, \\"upstream\\". It is the name of a Southern Coast Salish group. North Fork The headwaters of the North Fork Skykomish River are located in the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness near Dishpan Gap along the Pacific Crest Trail. It flows as a small stream off the north slope of Skykomish Peak. The Wild Sky Wilderness protects tributaries and forests adjacent to the North Fork Skykomish, although not the river itself. The river flows generally in a southwestern direction from its source to its mouth. Just before picking up Goblin Creek, the river flows through a short but impressive canyon and within that canyon the river drops over Deer Falls. A short ways down from that, the river flows through an even shorter but very twisted and unusually shaped canyon at Bear Creek Falls.  Tributaries of the North Fork  * Pass Creek: Leads to Cady Pass. * Quartz Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak, leads to Curry Gap. * Goblin Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak. * West Cady Creek * Troublesome Creek: Flows from Monte Cristo Peak, through Blanca Lake, to join the North Fork just below Bear Creek Falls. * Silver Creek: Rises near Silvertip Mountain and Poodle Dog Pass, flows by Mineral City, joins North Fork just above Galena (early route to Monte Cristo mining district; both Mineral City and Galena former mining towns). * Salmon Creek: Joins North Fork just below Galena. * Trout Creek: Upstream of the town of Index, just downstream of the Index-Galena Road washout. Trout Creek road is currently blocked (as of 2015). South Fork The South Fork Skykomish River begins at the confluence of the Tye River and the Beckler River, to the east of Skykomish. From the confluence the South Fork flows northwest. Near the eastern boundary of the city of Skykomish, the Beckler River joins it. To the west of the city of Skykomish, the Miller River joins it. Shortly before converging with the North Fork the river drops over Eagle Falls, followed by Canyon Falls and then, finally, Sunset Falls before its confluence with the North Fork.

Photo by Asahel Curtis. In the 1890s the Great Northern Railway was built along the Skykomish, South Fork Skykomish, and Tye Rivers, crossing the crest of the Cascades at Stevens Pass. Today the track is owned by BNSF Railway, known as the Burlington Northern Railroad from 1970 to 1995. Stevens Pass is named after the Great Northern surveyor John Frank Stevens. Two railroad tunnels, both called Cascade Tunnel, were built at Stevens Pass. The first one was built slightly north of the pass. It was replaced in 1929 with the New Cascade Tunnel, which at long was for nearly 60 years the longest railroad tunnel in North America and is still the longest in the United States. The New Cascade Tunnel is a few miles south of Stevens Pass. Its western entrance is near the confluence of Tunnel Creek and the Tye River. A small amount of the water flows out of both tunnels into the Tye River. An interpretive center for the Iron Goat Trail, located at Scenic on the upper Tye River, describes the history of the area including the old railroad and new trail. The interpretive center was built near the site of one of the greatest railroad tragedies in American history, the Wellington Disaster. One of the Native American trails crossing the Cascades followed the Skykomish and North Fork Skykomish to Cady Pass.  Recreation  The Skykomish River is used for rafting and kayaking, especially around the Index, WA area during the summer months. The Skykomish River is mostly ranked between Class III and Class III+ rapids, depending on the circumstances and season, but includes Boulder Drop, a class IV+ rapids. Skykomish and its tributaries also popular place for recreational fishing. River is a home for chinook, coho and pink salmon, steelhead and bull trout.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Minnesota Twins (1998‚Äì2003), San Francisco Giants (2004), Chicago White Sox (2005‚Äì2012), Texas Rangers (2013), Boston Red Sox (2014), St. Louis Cardinals (2014) and Atlanta Braves (2015‚Äì2016). Pierzynski is one of only ten catchers in Major League history to reach 2,000 hits in his career. Pierzynski is known for having a strong and colorful personality, a fact he acknowledges. During his turn at the microphone following the White Sox victory parade in 2005, he thanked team personnel for \\"putting up\\" with him. Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guill√©n summed up the situation as, \\"If you play against him, you hate him. If you play with him, you hate him a little less.\\" Guill√©n also acknowledged Pierzynski's value to the club, despite being relatively high- maintenance: \\"A.J.'s been great for me.

He attended Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida, where he won All-State honors in baseball. Future Major Leaguer Johnny Damon was one of Pierzynski's high school teammates.Chris Berman during Game 1 of 2005 ALDS ESPN Telecast Professional career =Minnesota Twins= Pierzynski graduated from high school in 1994 and signed a letter of intent to play baseball at the University of Tennessee. He was also selected by the Minnesota Twins in the third round (71st overall) of that year's MLB Draft and chose to sign with the ballclub on June 9. He began his minor league career with the Gulf Coast League Twins and spent the next four years playing for the minor-league Elizabethton Twins, Fort Wayne Wizards, Fort Myers Miracle, New Britain Rock Cats, and Salt Lake Buzz. After four years in the Twins organization, he was called up to the major league team, and made his debut on September 9, 1998, when he was 21 years old. Two days later, he singled off of Billy Taylor for his first major league hit. He then spent the next five seasons, through the 2003 season, with Minnesota, though he was not a regular starter until 2001. From 1998‚Äì2000, he appeared in just 49 games for the Twins. In 2002, he made the American League All-Star Team as a reserve catcher. In the 2002 American League Division Series, Pierzynski hit an important home run in the ninth inning of the final game, in which the Twins clinched the series. In 2003, Pierzynski reached a .312 batting average, a career-high.\\"A.J. Pierzynski,\\" Career stats, Chicago White Sox, official website. Retrieved May 18, 2007. =San Francisco Giants= After the 2003 season, the Twins traded Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants for Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, and Boof Bonser. With the Giants he hit .272 with 11 home runs and 77 RBIs. He spent one season in San Francisco before being non-tendered. =Chicago White Sox= Pierzynski was signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox on January 6, 2005.\\"A.J. Pierzynski,\\" Transactions, Baseball-reference.com, Retrieved May 18, 2007. When he signed with the White Sox, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a story claiming that the catcher had kneed Giants trainer Stan Conte in the groin during a spring training game in 2004. Although the incident allegedly happened during the game, it went unreported for nearly a year in the press. Pierzynski has disputed the allegations publicly. \\"Don't you think if something like that happened, in spring training, you would have heard about it? I would have gotten in some sort of trouble?\\" Pierzynski would hit 18 home runs, a new career-high, with his most memorable home run of the regular season coming on June 18, 2005 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth to walk-off a 5-3 win. It was also memorable as both teams were wearing their 1959 throwback jerseys to commemorate their meeting in the 1959 World Series. Pierzynski would help the White Sox go wire-to-wire in his first season with the team, winning the AL Central on September 29, 2005 in a win against the Detroit Tigers. However, Pierzynski's biggest contributions would come during the White Sox 2005 playoff run. In the 2005 playoffs, Pierzynski was a major player for the White Sox. In Game 1 of the ALDS against the defending champion Red Sox, Pierzynski would start the White Sox off strong with a 3-run homer in the first inning off of Matt Clement. He would add a second home run in the bottom of the 8th off Bronson Arroyo to help lead the White Sox to a blistering 14-2 win. Pierzynski finished the game 3-3 with 4 RBIs. Pierzynski also hit a double and scored an insurance run in the top of the 9th inning as the White Sox defeated the Red Sox 5-3 to clinch the series and move on to the ALCS. Perhaps Pierzynski's biggest, and most well-known play, came in Game 2 of the ALCS against the then Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Down 0-1 in the series and the game tied at 1-1 in the bottom of the 9th inning, Pierzynski famously struck out on a low ball in the dirt from Kelvim Escobar. Thinking they had ended the inning, the Angels proceeded to walk off of the field; however, noting that home plate umpire Doug Eddings had not made the out call, Pierzynski ran down the line to first base and was called safe. Angels catcher Josh Paul and manager Mike Scioscia argued with Eddings but the call stood, and Pierzynski was replaced by Pablo Ozuna, who promptly stole second base. Joe Crede would end the game on a walk-off double to tie the series at 1-1. The White Sox did not lose again, winning the next 3 games in Anaheim to advance to their first World Series since 1959. The White Sox would then sweep the Houston Astros to win their first championship in 88 years, giving Pierzynski his first ring. Pierzynski batted .262 with 3 home runs and 9 RBI, catching all 11 games for the White Sox during their championship run. In 2006, Pierzynski was named one of the five American League players in the All- Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards the Chicago White Sox organization began an election campaign using the slogan \\"Punch A.J.\\". Pierzynski received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the American League, subsequently sending him to his second All-Star appearance. The \\"Punch A.J.\\" campaign was inspired by an incident on May 20, 2006 between Pierzynski and Chicago Cubs catcher Michael Barrett. After a fly ball out, Pierzynski tagged up at third base and tried to score on the throw. After a collision at home, where Pierzynski knocked Barrett from his feet, Pierzynski slapped home plate with his hand. After getting up, Barrett grabbed Pierzynski and punched him in the face. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, and Pierzynski, Barrett, White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry were ejected. When play finally resumed, outfielder Scott Podsednik promptly got on base, loading the bases up, and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi cleared them with a grand-slam. The White Sox won the game, 7-0. Michael Barrett was suspended for 10 games, while Brian Anderson was suspended for five, and Pierzynski was fined. Pierzynski caught Mark Buehrle's no-hitter on April 18, 2007, but not his perfect game on July 23, 2009. He caught Philip Humber's perfect game on April 21, 2012 against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, as well. On May 28, 2007, in a game versus the Minnesota Twins, Pierzynski twice ran down the first base line with his feet on the inside of the base, possibly nipping Twins first baseman Justin Morneau with his spikes. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire was furious with the umpires, which resulted in a long tirade. However, he was not ejected. Pierzynski denied any attempt to step on Morneau. Pierzynski holds the AL record for consecutive errorless chances with 962, breaking Yogi Berra's previous record of 950, set in 1959. Pierzynski agreed to a two-year contract to remain with the White Sox after the 2010 season. On June 13, 2012, Pierzynski was rated the most hated MLB player. In 2012, Pierzynski homered in five consecutive games, tying the franchise record and becoming the sixth player to achieve this feat. His teammate Paul Konerko was the most recent Sox player to achieve this feat in 2011. Pierzynski had a career offensive year, winning a Silver Slugger Award at catcher, his first, while hitting .278/.326/.501 with 27 HR and 77 RBI. =Texas Rangers= Following the 2012 season, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year contract for 2013 with the Texas Rangers worth $7.5 million. He enjoyed a solid year for Texas, hitting .272 with 17 home runs and 70 RBIs in 503 at-bats. =Boston Red Sox= On December 3, 2013, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox, pending the completion of a physical examination. The deal became official the next day.Twitter / Ken_Rosenthal: Pierzynski passed physical with #RedSox, one-year deal is official. On June 4, 2014, Pierzynski was ejected by umpire Quinn Wolcott after a leadoff walk by pitcher Brandon Workman because he asked Wolcott to \\"give me a new ball. One you can see.\\" This was Pierzynski's ninth career ejection. Pierzynski's offense regressed with Boston as he hit .254/.286/.348 in 256 at-bats. On July 9, 2014, Pierzynski was designated for assignment and Christian Vazquez was promoted from AAA Pawtucket. A sports column in a Boston newspaper cited disgruntled anonymous Red Sox teammates who disliked Pierzynski, blaming him for the team's overall woes. On July 16, the Red Sox officially released Pierzynski. The Red Sox continued a disastrous slide after Pierzynski departed and finished 2014 with a record of 71‚Äì91. =St. Louis Cardinals= St. Louis Cardinals in 2014 On July 26, 2014, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Pierzynski to a major league deal. Later that day, he debuted for St. Louis with a 3-for-4 outing and an RBI, helping to defeat the Cubs 6‚Äì3. Former Boston teammate John Lackey soon arrived via trade, and Pierzynski caught him for the 19th time in 22 starts in 2014 when he debuted for the Cardinals on August 3. It was the pitcher's 150th career win. Pierzynski's first home run with St. Louis came in a loss to Baltimore on August 8. He hit .244/.295/.305 in 82 at-bats, mostly serving as a backup catcher to Yadier Molina. The Cardinals left Pierzynski off the playoff roster for the NLDS against the Dodgers,http://nesn.com/2014/10/a-j-pierzynski-videobombs-mike-matheny-during- cardinals-win-gif/ but added him for the NLCS against the Giants. =Atlanta Braves= Atlanta Braves in 2015 spring training Pierzynski and the Atlanta Braves finalized a one-year deal worth $2 million on January 7, 2015. The Braves had intended to use him as a backup catcher and mentor to Christian Bethancourt. However, Bethancourt struggled defensively and was eventually sent down to Gwinnett in the hope that he would improve, forcing Pierzynski into a starting role. On July 18, 2015, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Pierzynski broke up Jon Lester's no-hit bid in the eighth inning of the Braves' 4‚Äì0 loss. On April 27, 2016, Pierzynski recorded his 2,000th career hit off Steven Wright of the Boston Red Sox, becoming the tenth catcher to reach the 2,000 hit mark. He was placed on 15-day DL on August 17, 2016. On March 28, 2017, Pierzynski announced he was retiring. Broadcasting career Chris Rose (left), Pierzynski (center), and Eric Karros (right) during the pregame show of the 2011 World Series Pierzynski was hired by Fox to be an analyst for the 2011 MLB postseason on the pregame and postgame show. He joined Fox again for the 2012, 2013, and 2015 postseasons. In 2017 Fox announced he would be a full-time analyst. Professional wrestling On December 8, 2005, Pierzynski appeared on TNA Impact!, a professional wrestling television program aired by the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Accompanied by White Sox strength trainer Dale Torborg, Pierzynski presented TNA wrestlers A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series. At the ceremony, an incident was staged to include Pierzynski in a controversy with the wrestlers. Pierzynski then made his professional wrestling managerial debut at TNA Turning Point 2005 on December 11, 2005, accompanying Torborg, Sabin and Dutt to ringside for their match against the Diamonds in the Rough. On October 10, 2006, Pierzynski appeared on ESPN2's Cold Pizza, wearing the X-Division Championship belt, and challenged WWE Champion John Cena, who was also a guest that morning, to a Title vs. Title steel cage match whenever Cena wanted to have it. Cena responded asking if Pierzynski got his championship belt out of a gumball machine outside. Pierzynski returned to TNA in January 2007, when he and Torborg confronted Lance Hoyt. At Against All Odds 2007 Pierzynski was in Torborg's corner when he was defeated by Hoyt, who had David Eckstein in his corner. On the September 7, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, Pierzynski made his first appearance on WWE television, replacing Chris Jericho in a game show called The Price is Raw, with Bob Barker hosting. Personal life Pierzynski is married to Lisa Pierzynski. The couple has two children, Ava and Austin.

The name comes from two German words: Rohr' 'reed' and Au 'riparian forest'. South of the village is a riparian forest and a swamp covered with reed. Rohrau is located in the \\"industrial quarter\\" (Industrieviertel) of Lower Austria. Its area is 20.50 km2, of which 8.38% is forested.Statistical data There is a kindergarten and a primary school (Volksschule).Schule/Bildung, municipal website Subdivisions Rohrau is subdivided into the following Katastralgemeinden: *Rohrau *Gerhaus *Hollern *Pachfurth History The area in pre-Roman times belonged to the Celtic kingdom of Noricum. In Roman Times, the area was part of the Roman province of Pannonia Superior; Rohrau is near to Carnuntum, a former Roman army camp close to the village of Petronell-Carnuntum. Rohrau grew along an old road next to the river Leitha connecting Carnuntum to the bridge crossing the river at Bruck an der Leitha, the current district capital. Schloss Rohrau In the Middle Ages, a castle was built, surrounded by a moat; later it was converted to a chateau. Its facade as seen today is in the \\"Josephinian Style\\", a late and very rare Baroque style that only was used during the reign of Emperor Joseph II in the late 18th century. The chateau (Schloss Rohrau) has been owned by the Counts of Harrach and their descendants since 1524, and it contains the largest private collection of Dutch oil paintings in Austria. In the 16th century, Rohrau was given the right to hold a market, thus becoming a Market town. In the early 18th century, the town was plagued by attacks from the Kuruczes, described by Geiringer as \\"the peasant army of the anti-Habsburg Hungarian party\\". In 1704, they plundered the town and burned homes, returning to do the same in 1706; a further attack took place in 1707. A resident who lost his house to the flames in both 1704 and 1706 was Lorenz Koller (born 1675), who was the Marktrichter (roughly, mayor) of the town and the maternal grandfather of Joseph Haydn (see below).Source for this paragraph: Geiringer (1983:5) =Rohrau as former border town= Rohrau stands in close proximity to the neighbouring state of Burgenland, which was part of Hungary until 1921. Rohrau once had a border checkpoint at the bridge crossing the river to what was then the Hungarian part of the Austrian Empire. This checkpoint, which now is a farmhouse, was only an internal border crossing, and the local noble family Harrach, in fact, owned land on both sides. =Rohrau and Haydn= Haydn's birth home in Rohrau, now a museum The composer Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau in 1732. His father Mathias was a master wheelwright who served as Marktrichter of the village; something akin to mayor. His mother had previously worked as a cook in the Harrach household. Haydn lived in Rohrau only until about 1738, when he was sent away to attend a boarding school in nearby Hainburg. The composer's birth home, which is also the birth home of his brother Michael Haydn, is today a museum; it only partially reflects its original form since it has been repeatedly restored following fires and floods. It has also been expanded to serve its purpose as a museum. The Haydn monument in the center of Rohrau A monument to Haydn was erected by Count Karl Leonhard Harrach in 1793, during the composer's own lifetime; it is thus the oldest of all Haydn monuments.Webster (n.d., section 1) It was originally placed in the park of Harrach chateau, on an artificial island (the \\"Haydn-Insel\\") in the Leitha River, created for the purpose.Head, Mathew (2000) Music with \\"No Past?\\" Archaeologies of Joseph Haydn and \\"The Creation\\". 19th-Century Music 23:191-217. Reference is to page 1. The monument was later transferred to the center of the village, where it stands today. When Haydn returned from London in 1795, he visited the monument during an emotional return to his home town.Geiringer (1983:11) =Historical population of Rohrau= *1971: 1,341 *1981: 1,258 *1991: 1,224 *2001: 1,455 *2011: 1,544 *2014: 1,569 Economy As of 2011, there were 47 companies related to agricultural and forestry, and 89 non-agricultural jobs. 791 persons were employed at their place of residence. 43 people were unemployed. Local agricultural products: sugar beets, wheat, maize/corn, potatoes, sheep, wine. Local politics The village mayor (B√ºrgermeister), is Herbert Speckl, Deputy Mayor is Albert Mayer. The \\"village secretary\\" (Gemeindesekrat√§r) is Josef R√∂ssler. In 2015 election the seats at the village council, 19 in total, were distributed between the People's Party - √ñVP (14) and the Social Democratic Party - SP√ñ (5).

The project aimed to make it easier for developers to embed parts of Mozilla into systems with limited system resources (for example, machines with low amounts of RAM). Background The Minimo Project was created to test the feasibility of porting a full-function desktop browser engine to advanced mobile devices. To minimize the use of system resources Minimo initially did not include some of Mozilla's functionality, such as support for SVG, although continuing experiments sought to include all the features of the Mozilla codebase. In addition, the browser used small screen rendering technology to reformat Web pages for pocket-sized displays and allowed a platform for UI experiments on mobile devices. The user interface was designed to take up minimal screen space, with a single 8px high toolbar and a hidden-by-default address bar. Other user interface functionality, such as bookmarks, history, and search, was migrated into a special homepage called the Homebase. Because Minimo is based on the Gecko infrastructure, developers can decide to build specific versions and evaluate other features such as the canvas, SVG support, and more. Chris Hofmann created the Minimo project shortly after leaving Netscape Communications in 2003, under funding from Nokia's Maemo team. He single-handedly saved the project from being canceled many times. Currently Chris works for the Mozilla Corporation. Chris was also responsible for some of the Minimo key features such as the Homebase bar, a format for displaying bookmarks more amenable to mobile devices. Early Minimo development centered on ARM devices (such as Hewlett-Packard's iPAQ) with around 64MB of RAM, running Familiar Linux and the GPE Palmtop Environment (where it was the default browser). Minimo 0.1 was released for this platform in 2004. The lead Minimo developer, Doug Turner, headed this and additional Mozilla mobile projects such as the Mozilla labs project named Joey. The Mozilla Foundation hired Turner in December 2004 to work full-time on Mobile projects. Minimo was funded by Nokia and others. Nokia's involvement became public in mid-2004. Chris and Doug teamed up with web developer Marcio Galli as he focused in user interface aspects and mostly creating built in applications for Minimo using HTML instead of XUL ‚Äî these were refereed in the source code as extensions but served as concept for web-based mobile apps featuring Flickr, Google Maps, and more. A Windows CE version of Minimo was created for Pocket PC 2003 software development kit. The first public build of Minimo for Windows CE was made available in February 2005. In June 2006, the 0.16 release of minimo included tabs, a \\"homebase bar\\" for fast navigation to frequently used web sites, and featured support for many advanced web development capabilities that made the mobile browser easier to use. On December 17, 2006, Turner, in his blog, acknowledged the slow pace of development, and revealed that Mozilla developers were exploring alternatives for Gecko-based web browsing on mobile handsets. Turner issued an invitation for others to \\"step up\\" as his own development priorities shift.MozillaZine Version 0.2 came out in March 2007 and represented a product targeted for mobile developers. Minimo 0.2 included and upgraded interface, and support for Windows Mobile 5. On November 27, 2007, project head Doug Turner announced that the project was no longer supported. By 2008 Doug Turner had begun on yet another mobile web browser, this time known as Firefox Mobile or Fennec. Criticism Probably because it was in the early stages of development, the Windows Mobile version of Minimo performed significantly slower than expected. The quality of rendered pages is congruent with the well-respected layout engine it implemented (Gecko), but the program had very high memory and hardware requirements compared to what was typically available on most handheld platforms (e.g. 64 megabytes of RAM, 206‚Äì624 MHz ARM-compatible CPU). Version 0.2 was recommended for developers targeting mobile devices or interested in AJAX- and Web Services-driven Web application for the mobile space. Minimo was compatible with many Web 2.0 applications, such as Gmail.

S. Lewis's greatest satanic characters. He first appears in Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet (1938), the first novel in Lewis's The Space Trilogy, as an eminent physicist who has invented space travel. He is defeated by the novel's protagonist Elwin Ransom on Mars (known to its inhabitants as \\"Malacandra\\"). Weston returns in the second book, in an attempt to wreak havoc on Venus (Perelandra), the \\"new Eden.\\" Imperialism on Malacandra In Out of the Silent Planet, Weston first appears with his accomplice, Dick Devine (the future Lord Feverstone in That Hideous Strength), attempting to abduct a mentally impaired young man named Harry, whom Weston considers subhuman and disposable. They plan to take him to Malacandra (Mars) as a human sacrifice to Oyarsa, its ruling angel. It is then that they are surprised by a chance visit by Elwin Ransom, the main character of the novel, who is an old schoolmate of Devine. Ransom grows suspicious of their activities, and Devine persuades Weston to abduct Ransom instead. Shortly after landing on Malacandra, Weston and Devine attempt to drag Ransom to the servants of Oyarsa, but an accident distracts them, and Ransom escapes. In the course of his adventures on Malacandra, Ransom learns that the Oyarsa, the being to whom he was supposedly to be sacrificed, wanted only to speak with a human to learn of the conditions on Earth, the 'Silent Planet'. The \\"civilized' Weston cannot understand this, expecting only savagery from \\"primitive\\" cultures. It is eventually revealed that the immediate purpose of Weston's and Devine's journey to Malacandra is to mine Malacandra's abundant gold. This is the only motive of the mercenary Devine, but Weston's plan is to open a new age of space colonization to ensure the eternal survival of the human race, an idea borrowed from Stapledon's Last and First Men. The seeming humanitarianism of Weston's scheme is corrupted by his contemptuous and colonialist attitude towards all other forms of life, including the humane and intelligent Malacandrans. Colonising Eden, in the name of Universal Spirit In Perelandra, the sudden arrival of Weston's spaceship on Venus is a great surprise to the self-doubting Ransom, who himself has been sent by an oyarsa to counter a mysterious threat. Weston has undergone a philosophical conversion since his near-death in returning from Mars: he considers his former devotion to the human race as \\"a mere prejudice\\", and now wishes to spread \\"Spirit ... the blind, inarticulate purposiveness\\" which drives emergent evolution. In his personal theology, Weston has come to the fatal misunderstanding that God and the Devil are one, and that his great work is guided by this syncretic Spirit. Indeed, Weston calls Ransom to joint him, since \\"nothing now divides you and me except a few outworn theological technicalities with which organised religion has unhappily allowed itself to get incrusted. But I have penetrated that crust.\\" But under Ransom's probing, Weston's new philosophy proves as self-aggrandizing as the old: \\"In so far as I am the conductor of the central forward pressure of the universe, I am it ... I, Weston, am your God and Devil. I call that Force into me completely ....\\" As he opens his soul, Weston is possessed by the Devil and lost as an independent personality, his frozen features suggesting that \\"either he was in no pain or in a pain beyond all human comprehension.\\" Ransom leaves to look for the Lady, and when he returns Weston is gone. Weston's end When Ransom finds him again, surrounded by ripped-apart frogs, Weston is no longer human: > He did not look like a sick man: but he looked very like a dead one.The face > which he raised from torturing the frog had that terrible power which the > face of a corpse sometimes has of simply rebuffing every conceivable human > attitude one can adopt towards it.... It looked at Ransom in silence and at > last began to smile... The smile was not bitter, nor raging, nor, in an > ordinary sense, sinister; it was not even mocking. It seemed to summon > Ransom, with a horrible na√Øvet√© of welcome, into the world of its own > pleasures, as if all men were at one in those pleasures, as if they were the > most natural thing in the world and no dispute could ever have occurred > about them. It was not furtive, nor ashamed, it had nothing of the > conspirator in it. It did not defy goodness, it ignored it to the point of > annihilation. Ransom perceived that he had never before seen anything but > half-hearted and uneasy attempts at evil. This creature was whole-hearted. > The extremity of its evil had passed beyond all struggle into some state > which bore a horrible similarity to innocence. The evil spirit possessing Weston works to corrupt the newly created race, tempting the Lady of Perelandra (the new Eve) into disobeying the commands of Maleldil (God), while Ransom pleads with her to resist the Un-man (Ransom's name for the possessed Weston). Eventually Ransom, realizing that he cannot defeat the Un-man with argument ‚Äî and prompted by Maleldil ‚Äî physically attacks the Un-man, and both are badly wounded in the ensuing fight, but neither can prevail. In an interlude, Weston's consciousness appears to resurface, dismaying Ransom with the confused horror of Hell: > [Death] is the real universe.... That‚Äôs what it all means.... That‚Äôs why > it‚Äôs so important to live as long as you can. All the good things are now‚Äîa > thin little rind of what we call life, put on for show, and then‚Äîthe real > universe for ever and ever. To thicken the rind by one centimetre‚Äîto live > one week, one day, one half-hour longer‚Äîthat‚Äôs the only thing that > matters.... Picture the universe as an infinite globe with this very thin > crust on the outside.... We are born on the surface of it and all our lives > we are sinking through it. When we‚Äôve got all the way through then we are > what‚Äôs called Dead: we‚Äôve got into the dark part inside, the real globe. If > your God exists, He‚Äôs not in the globe ... from His point of view, we move > away, into what He regards as nonentity, where He never follows. That is all > there is to us, all there ever was.... Reasoning itself is only valid as > long as you stay in the rind. It has nothing to do with the real > universe.... You try to connect things and can't. They take your head > off...and you can't even look back on what life was like...because you know > it never did mean anything even from the beginning. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether anything he says is Weston or the Devil working through him. Indeed, Ransom concludes: Ransom finally kills Weston in the tunnels beneath Perelandra and rolls his body into a volcanic abyss. Ransom, having carved a monument to the great physicist into the wall outside the caverns, makes his way up to a mountaintop, to meet the grateful Lady and the King of the new planet. Lifespan According to Ransom's epitaph, Weston lived from 1896 to 1942 (Perelandra, chapter 15). However, the notion that he died at the age of 46 conflicts with Weston's explanation in Chapter 7 that he had neglected the study of biology \\"until I reached the fifties\\". Possible Influences Weston may be a caricature of Cecil John Rhodes (1853-1902) an English South African businessman and imperialist politician. Like Rhodes, Weston, while supremely capable, is racist, amoral, and rapacious, and hates God and religion. In a passing comment in That Hideous Strength, it is said that Great Britain has produced both heroes and villains, that for every King Arthur, there is a traitor Mordred, for every Sydney (the medieval poet), there is a Cecil Rhodes. In \\"Perelandra\\", Weston mentions his liking of the book of which Rhodes said \\"it made me who I am‚Äù: Winwood Reade's The Martyrdom of Man, which expounded the ideology of secular humanism. There is a glancing allusion to George Bernard Shaw: Weston's speech on Malacandra, like Back to Methuselah, ends with the words \\"It is enough for me that there is a Beyond\\", and Weston shares Shaw's (and Henri Bergson's) belief in the Life Force. Another possible influence is the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the goal of whose philosophy was the advent of the \\"super-man\\". He may also be based on J. B. S. Haldane. Weston is said by Bob Rickard to be similar to the fallen wizard Saruman from J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings, although he precedes The Lord of the Rings.Bob Rickard. , Fortean Times, January 2010 The choice of the name \\"Weston\\" might be more than accidental, considering that in his speech in Out of the Silent Planet he presents himself very much as the proponent of \\"Western Civilization\\" in its most expansionist and aggressive mode. (The names of the main villains in That Hideous Strength, \\"Wither\\" and \\"Frost\\", are clearly meant to reflect their characters.) Professor Weston can also stand for the scientific elitism that despises all other types of knowledge.

Sharing the straight-6 XK engine and many mechanical components with its C-Type predecessor, its structure however was radically different. Innovative monocoque construction and aerodynamic efficiency integrated aviation technology in a sports racing car, some examples including a renowned vertical stabilizer. Engine displacement began at 3.4 litres, was enlarged to 3.8 L in 1957, and reduced to 3.0 L in 1958 when Le Mans rules limited engines for sports racing cars to that maximum. D-Types won Le Mans in 1955, 1956 and 1957. After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as XKSS versions whose extra road-going equipment made them eligible for production sports car races in America. In 1957 25 of these cars were in various stages of completion when a factory fire destroyed nine of them. Total production is thought to have included 18 factory team D-Types, 53 customer cars and 16 XKSS versions. Design 1955 cockpit 1955 D-Type with stabilizing fin XK6 engine The design, by Jaguar's Technical Director and Chief Engineer William Heynes, applied aeronautical technology, revolutionary at the time. The \\"tub\\", or cockpit section, was of monocoque construction, mostly comprising sheets of aluminium alloy. Its elliptical shape and comparatively small cross-section provided torsional rigidity and reduced drag. To the front bulkhead was attached an aluminium tubing subframe for the engine, steering assembly, and front suspension. Rear suspension and final drive were mounted to the rear bulkhead. Fuel was carried in the tail and the designers followed aviation practice by specifying a deformable Marston Aviation Division bag in place of a conventional tank. The aerodynamic influence was partly the work of Malcolm Sayer, who had joined Jaguar following a stint with the Bristol Aeroplane Company during the Second World War and later worked on the C-Type. The D-Type required a minimal frontal area. To reduce the XK engine's height, Chief Engineer William Heynes, responsible for the C and D type overall design, developed dry sump lubrication, and it has been said that the car's frontal area was also a consideration in canting the engine at 8¬Ω¬∞ from the vertical (which necessitated the offset bonnet bulge). Philip Porter, in his book Jaguar Sports Racing Cars, says that \\"[a] more likely reason was to provide extra space for the ram pipes feeding the three twin-choke Weber carburettors.\\" Reducing underbody drag contributed to the car's high top speed; for the long Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans, a fin was mounted behind the driver for aerodynamic stability. For the 1955 season, factory cars were fitted with a longer nose, which lengthened the car by 7¬Ω inches and further increased maximum speed; and the headrest fairing and aerodynamic fin were combined as a single unit that smoothed the aerodynamics and saved weight. Mechanically, many features were shared with the outgoing C-Type. Its front and rear suspension and innovative all-round disc brakes were retained, as was the XK engine. Apart from the new lubrication system, the engine was further revised as development progressed during the D-Type's competition life. Notably in 1955, larger valves were introduced, together with asymmetrical cylinder heads to accommodate them. Elements of the body shape and many construction details were used in the Jaguar E-Type 1961-1969. Competition history D-Type XKD403, winner of the 1954 Reims 12 Hours race Jaguar D-Types fielded by a team under the leadership of Jaguar's racing manager Lofty England were expected to perform well in their debut at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans race. In the event, the cars were hampered by fuel starvation caused by problems with the fuel filters, necessitating pit stops for their removal, after which the entry driven by Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt speeded up to finish less than a lap behind the winning Ferrari. The D-Type's aerodynamic superiority is evident from its maximum speed of 172.8 mph on the Mulsanne Straight compared with the 4.9 litre Ferrari's 160.1 mph. Three weeks later the D Type won the Rheims 12 hour endurance race. For 1955 the cars were modified with long-nose bodywork and engines uprated with larger valves. At Le Mans, they proved competitive with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLRs, which had been expected to win. Mike Hawthorn's D-Type had a narrow lead over Juan Manuel Fangio's Mercedes when another Mercedes team car was involved in the most catastrophic accident in motorsport history.Deadliest Crash:the Le Mans 1955 Disaster (Programme Website), BBC Four documentary, broadcast 16 May 2010. Driver Pierre Levegh and more than 80 spectators lost their lives, while many more were injured. Mercedes withdrew from the race. Jaguar opted to continue, and the D-Type driven by Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb went on to win. 1957 Le Mans 24 Hours race, in Ecurie Ecosse metallic \\"flag blue\\" livery Mercedes withdrew from motorsport at the end of the 1955 season, and Jaguar again entered Le Mans in 1956. Although only one of the three factory-entered cars finished, in sixth place, the race was won by a D-Type entered by the small Edinburgh-based team Ecurie Ecosse and driven by Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson, beating works teams from Aston Martin and Scuderia Ferrari. In America, the Cunningham team raced several D-Types. In 1955, for example, a 1954 works car on loan to Cunningham won the Sebring 12 Hours in the hands of Mike Hawthorn and Phil Walters, and in May 1956 the team's entries for Maryland's Cumberland national championship sports car race included four D-Types in Cunningham's white and blue racing colors. Driven by John Fitch, John Gordon Benett, Sherwood Johnston and team owner Briggs Cunningham, they finished fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth, respectively. Although Jaguar withdrew from motorsport at the end of the 1956 season, 1957 proved to be the D-Type's most successful year. 3.8-litre engine Jaguar D-Types took five of the top six places at Le Mans, and Ecurie Ecosse, with considerable support from Jaguar, finished first and second, the best result in the D-Type's racing history. Rules for the 1958 Le Mans race limited engine sizes to three litres for sports racing cars, which ended the domination of the 3.8-litre D-Type. Jaguar developed a 3.0 litre version to power D-Types in the 1958, 1959 and 1960 Le Mans races, but it proved unreliable, and by 1960 no longer produced sufficient power to be competitive. The D-Type never again achieved a podium finish at Le Mans. Its success waned as support from Jaguar decreased and cars from rival manufacturers became more competitive, although from 1960 the D Type continued for a further three years or more to be one of the cars to beat in club racing and national events. XKSS Road-equipped XKSS After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team in 1956, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as XKSS versions whose additional road-going equipmentincluding a second seat, passenger-side door, side windows, full- width framed windscreen and windscreen wipers, trimmed interior, folding hood, and bumpersmade them eligible for production sports car races in America. On the evening of 12 February 1957, a fire broke out at Jaguar's Browns Lane plant and destroyed nine of the 25 cars that were in various stages of completion.

The forward part of the launch may be covered. Prior to the era of engines on small craft, a launch was the largest boat carried on a sailing vessel, powered by sail or by oars. In competitive rowing, a launch is a motorized boat used by the coach during training. History Originally a launch, or a long-boat, was the biggest boat carried by a warship or a merchant vessel in the age of sail. The word comes from the Spanish lancha (\\"barge\\") and Portuguese, from Malay lancaran (\\"swift boat\\"), which in turn derived from lancar (\\"velocity without effort\\"). In the age of sail, a ship carried a variety of boats of different sizes and used for different purposes. In addition to the launch, examples include the jolly boat, captain's gig, pinnace, and cutter. Distinctions among the smaller vessels were clear, both in design and purpose. In the age of motorized ships, these distinctions of size and purpose have largely disappeared, but the terms continue in use. During the Demak Sultanate attack on Portuguese Malacca of 1513, lancaran were used as armed troop transports for landing alongside penjajap and kelulus, as the Javanese junks were too large to approach shore. In the 18th century, a launch was used to set the large anchors on a ship. The launch of that era had a square transom and was about 24 feet long. In 1788 Captain Bligh was set adrift in Bounty‚Äôs launch. Civilian use in the UK On the River Thames the term \\"launch\\" is used to mean any motorised pleasure boat. The usage arises from the legislationThames Conservancy Act 1932 governing the management of the Thames and laying down the categories of boats and the tolls for which they were liable. Military launches in the UK Motor Launch was the designation for a type of vessel used in World War II by the Royal Navy and some other navies for inshore work defending the coast from submarines. They were typically long and carried relatively light armament ‚Äì a few depth charges, a gun and a few machine guns.

Hickok (Born 1951, Denver, Colorado) is an advocate for public education reform and an expert in constitutional law. Education Hickok is a 1972 graduate of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in Virginia. He also received his master's and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia. Career =Academics= For 15 years, Hickok taught political science at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and served as director of the college's Clarke Center for the Interdisciplinary Study of Contemporary Issues. He also was an adjunct professor at the Dickinson School of Law. He was recognized as an outstanding teacher and was twice awarded Dickinson's prestigious Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching in 1985 and 1990. Hickok now serves as an adjunct professor of Constitutional Politics at the University of Richmond. He also was an associate director of the political science department at Mississippi State University, and the director of financial aid for Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in Virginia. An expert on public policy, the U.S. Constitution and Federalism, Hickok has published articles and books on government and public policy, and has made presentations on these topics before myriad local, state and national organizations. In 1991, Hickok was a consultant to the governments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia regarding constitutional, political, and economic reform. In 1986 and 1987, Hickok served as a special assistant in the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice. He also has served as an adjunct scholar at the Heritage Foundation, where he was a resident scholar in 1990 and 1991. He was elected as a member of the Carlisle Area School District Board of Directors and served until his appointment in 1995 as Education Secretary. Hickok also was a founding member and chairman of the Education Leaders Council, a group of reform-minded education chiefs who oversaw 30 percent of the nation's K-12 public school students in 2000. He also served on the Carlisle Area School District School Board, before being appointed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Hickok was Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, where he was responsible for overseeing the state's education system - kindergarten through college. He was an advocate for parental choice and accountability in education and introduced standards for students and teachers. He was an early advocate for public charter schools and worked to pass Pennsylvania's law to allow for the creation of locally designed charter public schools. Deputy Secretary of Education President George W. Bush nominated Hickok as his Deputy Secretary of Education on March 30, 2001 and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 10, 2001. Hickok served as both the Under Secretary of Education and Acting Deputy Secretary between July 2003 and November 3, 2003 when the President nominated him to become Deputy Secretary. The deputy secretary is the chief policy advisor to the Secretary. In this position, Hickok oversaw and managed the development of policies, recommendations and initiatives that help define a broad, coherent vision for achieving the President's education priorities, including the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). However, on December 2, 2004, Hickok announced he was resigning as deputy education secretary, one week after a federal study concluded that charter schools were \\"less likely to meet state performance standards\\" due to \\"higher numbers of low-achieving minority students from poor families.\\"\\"U.S. education figure resigns.\\" (December 4, 2004). The Intelligencer, Doylestown, PA.\\"Charter schools' progress lags - Enrollment of disadvantaged a factor, study finds\\". (November 23, 2004). The Washington Times. The relative performance of charter schools compared to the national public school system is a debated aspect of NCLB. In addition, two months earlier the Government Accountability Office had also criticized NCLB citing \\"serious obstacles\\" and \\"a lack of clear and timely guidance from federal officials\\" in response to the program's newly expanded annual testing practices. The GAO recommended that the Department of Education provide states with written guidelines, however Hickok rejected the request.\\"School testing mandate in doubt.

Collectively, they were best known for their association with Shakur. History In the earlier years of the Outlawz, they were known as Dramacydal. Dramacydal first appeared on the B-side of Tupac Shakur's 1993 single \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\\", on the track \\"Flex\\". Dramacydal was composed of K-Dog (Kastro), Young Hollywood (Yaki Kadafi), Mutah or Mu (Napoleon), and Big Malcolm (E.D.I. Mean). They also appeared on 2Pac's Me Against The World and All Eyez on Me albums. They were also known as \\"Thoro Headz\\" and \\"Young Thugz\\". When 2Pac signed to Death Row upon his release from prison, he recruited his stepbrother, Mopreme Shakur, and Big Syke from Thug Life. Hussein Fatal, Napoleon, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Yaki Kadafi, and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added. Together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's multi-platinum smash hit album All Eyez on Me. They later dropped the title of \\"Immortalz\\" after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi. Subsequently, some of the members of Thug Life, not joined by the others, moved on as the \\"Outlawz\\". When Tupac Shakur recorded \\"Hit 'Em Up\\", a diss track beamed towards his former friend and rival The Notorious B.I.G., Puff Daddy, and Lil' Kim, he recruited three members from the group he had previously worked with, eager to work with them again. Together with New Jersey rappers and other associates they formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. Young Noble was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, that carried 2Pac's new stage name, Makaveli. It was on this Makaveli album that Outlawz, appearing on a few songs, first came to the greater rap community's notice. The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various leaders who resisted control by the new world order, past and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a backronym out of the letters of their group name, \\"Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriorz\\", although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently. =Original members= There were ten original members of the Outlawz, including Makaveli: *Makaveli (Tupac Shakur), also known as 2pac, was the leader of the group; he gave himself the name of Makaveli after the Italian political philosopher Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, whose writings inspired Shakur in prison. Shakur was fatally injured in a drive-by shooting on September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada. *Yaki Kadafi (Yafeu Fula), also known as Young Hollywood, Yak and Killa Kadafi, was given the name Yaki Kadafi after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He was also Shakur's godbrother and an original member of Dramacydal. He was shot and killed by Napoleon's cousin in what is believed to have been an accident on November 10, 1996, 2 months after the death of Tupac Shakur. *Kastro (Katari Cox), also known as K-Dog, Kato and K.Kastro was given the alias Kastro after Cuban communist revolutionary and leader Fidel Castro. He is also a blood cousin of Shakur and an original member of Dramacydal. In 2009, Kastro left the Outlawz. *E.D.I. Mean (Malcolm Greenridge), also known as Big Mal, was given the alias E.D.I. Mean (later changed to EDIDON) after Ugandan president and dictator Idi Amin and was also an original member of Dramacydal. *Hussein Fatal (Bruce Washington), also known as Dirty Bruce, Dizza and Fatal Hussein, introduced to Tupac by childhood friend Yaki Kadafi, was given the alias after former President and leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. Hussein left the group temporarily in June 1996 after accidentally crashing a truck, which Tupac bought for the Outlawz, into a pole while being intoxicated, thus knowing that he might get kicked out of the group. He more recently rejoined the Outlawz, which then comprised him, Young Noble and Edi before being killed in a car accident on July 10, 2015. *Napoleon (Mutah Beale), also known as Lil Mu, childhood friend of Kadafi, was given the alias after French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte and was also an original member of Dramacydal. Napoleon left the group in 2005 and went on to be a Muslim motivational speaker. *Mussolini (Tyruss Himes), also known as Big Syke who was in 2Pac's previous group Thug Life, joined the Outlawz and Makaveli gave him the name Moozaliny after Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. He died December 5, 2016. *Komani (Mopreme Shakur), 2Pac's stepbrother, who was in 2Pac's previous group Thug Life, joined the Outlawz under the alias Komani after the Iranian political figure Ruhollah Khomeini. *Storm Harkness (Donna Harkness), The only female member of the group, she met Tupac during the shooting of a film. After he found out how well she could rap, he immediately signed her on the spot and added her to the group, which later became known as The Outlaw Immortalz. She was introduced on the multiplatinum selling album All Eyez on Me. *Young Noble (Rufus Cooper III), the last official Outlaw member. He was introduced to Tupac by Kadafi and Hussein (Fatal-N-Felony) in Los Angeles, a few months before his death. He appeared in many of 2Pac's last recordings, and featured on 2Pac's last album and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory. He was always known as Young Noble and was never given an alias from Tupac. =Other members= *Nutt-So (Sean Cole, brother of Keyshia Cole) *New Child (Wallace Lynch, joined in 1999) *Muszamil (Kamil Beale, brother of Napoleon) *Stormey Coleman (Courtney Coleman, joined in 2003) Later years Shortly after joining the group, Mopreme and Big Syke severed all ties with Death Row and left the Outlawz for financial and personal reasons. Two months after the death of Shakur, Kadafi was killed in a housing project in New Jersey; after two years, Napoleon convinced his cousin to turn himself in for shooting Kadafi. Though Tupac had told them specifically to never sign to Death Row Records and were originally going to sign to Makaveli Records, but after his death, the leftover members of the Outlawz decided to do just that. As a result, Fatal left the group, claiming they were not being loyal to 2Pac. Napoleon left the group due to his conversion to Islam and is now traveling all around the globe to spread the teachings of Islam. While managing and working on her solo project, Tupac signed Storm to Death Row Records. She left the group shortly after the death of Tupac. The Outlawz are also known for their longtime relationship with Brooklyn's Boot Camp Clik, a relationship that begun as a result of 2Pac's friendship with Boot Camp's Smif-n-Wessun and Boot Camp Clik, while working on the yet unreleased \\"One Nation\\" album. Despite stylistic differences and divergent fanbases, the two crews maintained connections on the basis of personal relationships. Members of the Outlawz were featured on Boot Camp releases like Heltah Skeltah's \\"Magnum Force\\" and Rock's \\"Veterans' Day.\\" In 1999, the Outlawz released their first album as a group with original unreleased recordings of 2Pac, entitled Still I Rise. The album was released on Death Row Records. Member Hussein Fatal did not appear on any of the album as he was edited out of the original recordings due to issues with the record labels. Storm was also edited out of some of the original recordings for unknown reasons. Original member Big Syke also appeared on the album. It wasn't until late 2000, though, that they finally got the go-ahead to release their debut album, Ride Wit Us Or Collide Wit Us. Unfortunately, the album didn't prove to be much of a success, and neither did the group's follow-up album a year later, Novakane, also released on the group's Outlaw Recordz label (distributed by Koch). In 2008 they signed a short deal with Young Buck's Ca$hville Records. In 2009, Kastro had confirmed he had left the Outlawz to pursue a solo career. He reunited with the group on Outlaw The Lost Songs Volume 1 & 2 in March 2010. Later the members went to release solo albums and collaborations with other artists. In 2009, the Outlawz reunited with former member Hussein Fatal, who had left the group following the deaths of Tupac and Yaki Kadafi. The Outlawz sixth studio album Perfect Timing was released on September 13, 2011 on 1Nation Entertainment. The album features guest appearances from many big name rappers including Bun B, Tech N9ne, Scarface, Krayzie Bone, Young Buck, Lloyd, among others and production from Focus..., Cozmo, Maxwell Smart, The Network and CyFyre. In 2011, some of the remaining members of The Outlawz made peace with longtime rival enemy Lil Cease of Junior Mafia. They both recorded a track called \\"Bury the Hatchet\\", on a DJ Kay Slay album. They also confirmed the longstanding rumor that they smoked Tupac's ashes. In 2014, Outlawz released a single named Karma featuring Snoop Dogg on June 5, 2014. In 2015, Hussein Fatal died in a car crash. In 2016, Mussolini died at his home in California. Between 2016 and 2017, the group released their final albums, Livin Legendz and LastOnezLeft.

Screwtape holds the rank of Senior Tempter and serves as the Undersecretary of his department in what Lewis envisages as a sort of infernal Civil Service.

Used as a research site by the U.S. Forest Service beginning in 1908, and functioning as an experimental forest since 1932, it is \\"known as the cradle of forest research in the Pacific Northwest\\". The site is probably best known for the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility (WRCCRF), a -high freestanding tower crane which supported an 8-person gondola allowing scientists to view the forest canopy from above. The tallest trees in the forest are about . Many studies at Wind River continue for decades. This long-term research has resulted in important and original findings about forest ecology and management. Location It is located west of the Cascade Range in the south-central area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, north of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. It is about a 1.5-hour drive east of Vancouver, Washington, in the Mount Adams Ranger District. History Research at Wind River began with the assignment of Forest Service scientist Thornton T. Munger in 1908 to the new North Pacific District in Portland, Oregon. Munger began studying the Douglas fir trees of the western Cascades, setting up research plots throughout the Wind River area. In 1910, Munger, along with Julius Kummel, established a permanent nursery at Wind River, near the existing Hemlock Ranger Station on the Columbia National Forest (today the Gifford Pinchot National Forest).Fry, Amelia. Thornton T. Munger: Forest Research in the Northwest. 1967. In 1912, Munger established the Wind River Arboretum to study the sustainability of exotic trees in the Pacific Northwest environment. The successful research operations already in place at Wind River led to the Forest Service officially designating the site as the Wind River Experiment Station in 1913. The Wind River Experiment Station became the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station in 1924, with operations based in Portland, Oregon and Thornton Munger as director. In 1932, the research area was officially designated as the Wind River Experimental Forest. The WRCCRF The WRCCRF was established in 1994 and erected in 1995 as a cooperative scientific and educational venture among the University of Washington (UW) College of Forest Resources, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The crane is a Liebherr 550 HC freestanding tower crane with a load jib extension purchased from Morrow Crane Company, Inc., of Salem, Oregon. According to an article by Sandra Hines, \\"While scientists have studied the tropical rain forest canopy for years with cranes, this is the first extensive study of the temperate forest canopy.\\" UW professor Jerry Franklin (who Hines describes as \\"the guiding force behind the crane\\") said that the study demonstrates that temperate conifer forests are better at banking carbon than any other ecosystem in the world, certainly more than tropical forests on a per unit area basis, at least 178 tons per acre (40 kg/m2.) This finding could have significant impact on strategies to fight global warming. The WRCCRF ceased operation in 2011. Administration It is administered cooperatively by the USFS Pacific Northwest Research Station and Gifford Pinchot National Forest, and is one of ten experimental areas associated with the United States Department of Agriculture's Pacific Northwest Research Station. The experimental forest has two administrative units: the Trout Creek and Panther Creek divisions. The Trout Creek division has old-growth forests, stands that originated after large wildfires in the first third of the 20th century, and young stands regenerated after clearcuts in the last half of the 20th century. The Panther Creek division has mature stands that grew after a fire in the early 1840s and young stands from more recent clearcuts.

Many online bookmark management services have launched since 1996; Delicious, founded in 2003, popularized the terms \\"social bookmarking\\" and \\"tagging\\". Tagging is a significant feature of social bookmarking systems, allowing users to organize their bookmarks and develop shared vocabularies known as folksonomies. Common features Unlike file sharing, social bookmarking does not save the resources themselves, merely bookmarks that reference them, i.e. a link to the bookmarked page. Descriptions may be added to these bookmarks in the form of metadata, so users may understand the content of the resource without first needing to download it for themselves. Such descriptions may be free text comments, votes in favor of or against its quality, or tags that collectively or collaboratively become a folksonomy. Folksonomy is also called social tagging, \\"the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content\\". In a social bookmarking system, users save links to web pages that they want to remember and/or share. These bookmarks are usually public, and can be saved privately, shared only with specified people or groups, shared only inside certain networks, or another combination of public and private domains. The allowed people can usually view these bookmarks chronologically, by category or tags, or via a search engine. Most social bookmark services encourage users to organize their bookmarks with informal tags instead of the traditional browser-based system of folders, although some services feature categories/folders or a combination of folders and tags. They also enable viewing bookmarks associated with a chosen tag, and include information about the number of users who have bookmarked them. Some social bookmarking services also draw inferences from the relationship of tags to create clusters of tags or bookmarks. Many social bookmarking services provide web feeds for their lists of bookmarks, including lists organized by tags. This allows subscribers to become aware of new bookmarks as they are saved, shared, and tagged by other users. It also helps to promote your sites by networking with other social book markers and collaborating with each other. As these services have matured and grown more popular, they have added extra features such as ratings and comments on bookmarks, the ability to import and export bookmarks from browsers, emailing of bookmarks, web annotation, and groups or other social network features. History A user page on del.icio.us in May 2004, displaying bookmarks with tags. The concept of shared online bookmarks is believed to have originated around April 1996 with the launch of itList, the features of which included public and private bookmarks.Extras - itList and Other Bookmark Managers by LaJean Humphries, January 17, 2000 Another system known as WebTagger, developed by a team at the Computational Sciences Division at NASA, was presented at the Sixth International WWW Conference held in Santa Clara on April 7‚Äì11, 1997. WebTagger included several advanced social bookmarking features including the ability to collaboratively share and organize bookmarks using a web-based interface, provide comments and organize them according to categories.\\"A Bookmarking Service for Organizing and Sharing URL by Richard M. Keller, Shawn R. Wolfe, James R. Chen, Joshua L. Rabinowitz, and Nathalie Mathe (Apr. 1997) Within the next three years, online bookmark services became competitive, with venture-backed companies such as Backflip, Blink, Clip2, ClickMarks, HotLinks, and others entering the market.\\"Livewire: Putting Your Bookmarks on the Web\\" by Michelle V.

Lacking viable revenue models, this early generation of social bookmarking companies failed as the dot-com bubble burst‚ÄîBackflip closed citing \\"economic woes at the start of the 21st century\\". In 2005, the founder of Blink said, \\"I don't think it was that we were 'too early' or that we got killed when the bubble burst. I believe it all came down to product design, and to some very slight differences in approach.\\" Founded in 2003, Delicious (then called del.icio.us) pioneered taggingMathes, A., Folksonomies ‚Äì Cooperative Classification and Communication Through Shared Metadata. Computer Mediated Communication ‚Äì LIS590CMC, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, December 2004. and coined the term social bookmarking. Frassle, a blogging system released in November 2003, included social bookmarking elements. In 2004, as Delicious began to take off, similar services Furl, Simpy, Spurl.net, and unalog were released, along with CiteULike and Connotea (sometimes called social citation services) and the related recommendation system Stumbleupon. Also in 2004, the social photo sharing website Flickr was released, and inspired by Delicious it soon added a tagging feature. In 2006, Ma.gnolia (later renamed to Gnolia), Blue Dot (later renamed to Faves), Mister Wong, and Diigo entered the bookmarking field, and Connectbeam included a social bookmarking and tagging service aimed at businesses and enterprises. In 2007, IBM released its Lotus Connections product.Think Research Featured Concept: Fetch! by members of the Collaborative User Experience group at IBM Research In 2009, Pinboard launched as a bookmarking service with paid accounts.Get it while it's cheap: Pinboard's revenue model by Rafe Needleman, CNet News, August 14, 2009 As of 2012, Furl, Simpy, Spurl.net, Gnolia, Faves, and Connectbeam are no longer active services. Digg was founded in 2004 with a related system for sharing and ranking social news, followed by competitors Reddit in 2005 and Newsvine in 2006. As of January 20, 2016, Reddit is now the 32nd highest ranking in the world and Digg is no longer a social bookmarking platform and has dropped out of the top 1000. Folksonomy A simple form of shared vocabularies does emerge in social bookmarking systems (folksonomy). Collaborative tagging exhibits a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics.Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211-220, ACM Press, 2007. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources have been shown to converge over time to stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, the correlations between different tags can be examined to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies.V. Robu, H. Halpin, H. Shepherd Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems, ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009. While such vocabularies suffer from some of the informality problems described below, they can be seen as emerging from the decentralized actions of many users, as a form of crowdsourcing. From the point of view of search data, there are drawbacks to such tag-based systems: no standard set of keywords (i.e., a folksonomy instead of a controlled vocabulary), no standard for the structure of such tags (e.g., singular vs. plural, capitalization), mistagging due to spelling errors, tags that can have more than one meaning, unclear tags due to synonym/antonym confusion, unorthodox and personalized tag schemata from some users, and no mechanism for users to indicate hierarchical relationships between tags (e.g., a site might be labeled as both cheese and cheddar, with no mechanism that might indicate that cheddar is a refinement or sub-class of cheeses). Uses For individual users, social bookmarking can be useful as a way to access a consolidated set of bookmarks from various computers, organize large numbers of bookmarks, and share bookmarks with contacts. Institutions including businesses, libraries, and universities have used social bookmarking as a way to increase information sharing among members. Social bookmarking has been also used to improve web search. =Enterprise bookmarking= =Libraries= Libraries have found social bookmarking to be useful as an easy way to provide lists of informative links to patrons. The University of Pennsylvania (UP) was one of the first library adopters with its PennTags.PennTags =Education= Social bookmarking tools are an emerging educational technology that has been drawing more of educators' attention over the last several years. This technology offers knowledge sharing solutions and a social platform for interactions and discussions. These tools enable users to collaboratively underline, highlight, and annotate an electronic text, in addition to providing a mechanism to write additional comments on the margins of the electronic document. For example, Delicious could be used in a course to provide an inexpensive answer to the question of rising course materials costs. RISAL (Repository of Interactive Social Assets for Learning) is another social bookmarking system used for supporting teaching and learning at the university level. Social bookmarking tools have several purposes in an academic setting including: organizing and categorizing web pages for efficient retrieval; keeping tagged pages accessible from any networked computer; sharing needed or desired resources with other users; accessing tagged pages with RSS feeds, cell phones and PDAs for increased mobility; allowing librarians and instructors the capability to follow students' progress; and giving students another way to collaborate with each other and make collective discoveries. One requirement unique to education is that resources often have one URL that describes the resource, with another for the actual learning content. XtLearn.netXtLearn.net allows bookmarking of both in one step, the relevant URL being delivered to either tutors or learners, depending on the delivery context. It also demonstrates integration with traditional learning content repositories, such as Jorum, NLN, Intute and TES. Comparison with search engines With regard to creating a good-quality search engine, a social bookmarking system has several advantages over traditional automated resource location and classification software, such as search engine spiders. All tag-based classification of Internet resources (such as web sites) is done by human beings, who understand the content of the resource, as opposed to software, which algorithmically attempts to determine the meaning and quality of a resource. Also, people can find and bookmark web pages that have not yet been noticed or indexed by web spiders. Additionally, a social bookmarking system can rank a resource based on how many times it has been bookmarked by users, which may be a more useful metric for end-users than systems that rank resources based on the number of external links pointing to it. However, both types of ranking are vulnerable to fraud, (see Gaming the system), and both need technical countermeasures to try to deal with this. Abuse Social bookmarking is susceptible to corruption and collusion. Due to its popularity, some have begun to use it as a tool to use along with search engine optimization to make their website more visible. The more often a web page is submitted and tagged, the better chance it has of being found. Spammers have started bookmarking the same web page multiple times and/or tagging each page of their web site using a lot of popular tags, obligating developers to constantly adjust their security system to overcome abuses. Furthermore, since social bookmarking generates backlinks, social bookmark link generating services are used by some webmasters in an attempt to improve their websites' rankings in search engine results pages.

Such a situation is common in wireless communication systems, in particular CDMA. In some signal jamming techniques, the near‚Äìfar problem is exploited to disrupt (\\"jam\\") communications. Analogies Consider a receiver and two transmitters, one close to the receiver, the other far away. If both transmitters transmit simultaneously and at equal powers, then due to the inverse square law the receiver will receive more power from the nearer transmitter. Since one transmission's signal is the other's noise, the signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) for the further transmitter is much lower. This makes the farther transmitter more difficult, if not impossible, to understand. In short, the near‚Äìfar problem is one of detecting or filtering out a weaker signal amongst stronger signals. To place this problem in more common terms, imagine you are talking to someone 6 meters away. If the two of you are in a quiet, empty room then a conversation is quite easy to hold at normal voice levels. In a loud, crowded bar, it would be impossible to hear the same voice level, and the only solution (for that distance) is for both you and your friend to speak louder. Of course, this increases the overall noise level in the bar, and every other patron has to talk louder too (this is equivalent to power control runaway). Eventually, everyone has to shout to make themselves heard by a person standing right beside them, and it is impossible to communicate with anyone more than half a meter away. In general, however, a human is very capable of filtering out loud sounds; similar techniques can be deployed in signal processing where suitable criteria for distinguishing between signals can be established (see signal processing and notably adaptive signal processing). Taking this analogy back to wireless communications, the far transmitter would have to drastically increase transmission power which simply may not be possible. Solutions In CDMA systems and similar cellular phone-like networks, the problem is commonly solved by dynamic output power adjustment of the transmitters. That is, the closer transmitters use less power so that the SNR for all transmitters at the receiver is roughly the same. This sometimes can have a noticeable impact on battery life, which can be dramatically different depending on distance from the base station. In high-noise situations, however, closer transmitters may boost their output power, which forces distant transmitters to boost their output to maintain a good SNR. Other transmitters react to the rising noise floor by increasing their output. This process continues, and eventually distant transmitters lose their ability to maintain a usable SNR and drop from the network. This process is called power control runaway. This principle may be used to explain why an area with low signal is perfectly usable when the cell isn't heavily loaded, but when load is higher, service quality degrades significantly, sometimes to the point of unusability. Other possible solutions to the near‚Äìfar problem: # Increased receiver dynamic range - Use a higher resolution ADC. Increase the dynamic range of receiver stages that are saturating. # Dynamic output power control ‚Äì Nearby transmitters decrease their output power so that all signals arrive at the receiver with similar signal strengths. # TDMA ‚Äì Transmitters use some scheme to avoid transmitting at the same time.

Commonly called \\"reading books\\" or \\"readers\\" they are usually published as anthologies that combine previously published short stories, excerpts of longer narratives, and original works. A standard basal series comes with individual identical books for students, a Teacher's Edition of the book, and a collection of workbooks, assessments, and activities. Description Basal readers are typically organized. Stories are chosen to illustrate and develop specific skills, which are taught in a pre-determined sequence. The teacher's editions are also tightly organized, containing much more than the answer key to the questions that usually appear at the end of each reading passage. The teacher's book also contains suggestions for pre- reading and post-reading activities and assessments, as well as scripted questions to ask students at specific points in a story. History Basal readers have been in use in the United States since the mid-1860s, beginning with a series called the McGuffey Readers. This was the first reader published with the idea of having one text for each grade level. Since then, teaching methodologies in school basals have shifted regularly. The Scott Foresman Company published what is perhaps the most famous basal series, whose stories starred two children named Dick and Jane. Dick and Jane books emphasized memorizing words on sight, a method which came to be known as \\"look and say.\\" This philosophy came under attack in the late 1950s, largely due to Rudolf Flesch's book Why Johnny Can't Read. This was a scathing condemnation of the \\"look say\\" method, and advocated a return to programs that stressed teaching phonics to beginning readers. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the pendulum did swing back toward a more phonics-based approach. During the latter part of the 1980s, basal usage declined as reading programs began to turn to whole language programs that relied more heavily on trade books, rather than textbooks. The 1990s and early years of the 21st century have seen a renewed interest in skills acquisition which has sparked a resurgence in basal dominance. Benefits The highly planned nature of basal readers is seen as one of their strengths, as this eases the load on teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced. Specific skills can be easily targeted, tested, and remediated. Those with very controlled vocabulary usage may ease difficulties for beginner or weak readers. Students who are reading below grade level will receive some benefits from using the on-level basal. The exposure will prepare them for state testing. Using a basal reader as a starting point for grade level reading allows educators to quickly assess student reading level. Basals are not meant to be the only resource a student uses, just the starting point.

It was their first official single release in February 1994. The single was originally released on vinyl only and is entirely different from the album version that appears on their EP, Trailer. The single was re-released in a limited edition 2002 on 2 December in CD format with and the Raptor 12‚Ä≥ version of \\"Season\\" as an extra B-side, as part of the promotion for the Intergalactic Sonic 7‚Ä≥s greatest hits collection. The song first appeared on the Shed demo tape, recorded in 1992 and again on the Garage Girl and Pipe Smokin' Brick demo-tapes. Ash were first signed when a copy of Garage Girl was given to Stephen 'Tav' Tavner, who signed them on the basis of \\"Jack Names the Planets\\". Only 2,000 copies of the single were released, and the single was recorded on a ¬£300 budget. However, the band was unhappy with the version released on the 1994 single, and re- recorded it for their first album. The title of the track is taken from a chapter of the Stephen King and Peter Straub novel, The Talisman. This book is further referenced in some of the lyrics. The single's B-side, \\"Don't Know\\", first appeared on the Garage Girl demo tape. In 1995, the song appeared on the soundtrack for the film Angus. Clips from the movie were interspersed with footage of Ash performing as figures in moving posters for the video of \\"Jack Names the Planets\\", which was also released in 1995. Phil Harder directed the video. The first 50,000 pressings of Ash's first full-length album, 1977, began with \\"Jack Names the Planets\\" and \\"Don't Know\\" as hidden tracks found by rewinding the CD, before the usual opener \\"Lose Control\\". \\"Jack Names the Planets\\" also appeared on Ash's first greatest hits collection Intergalactic Sonic 7‚Ä≥s, and is considered a fan and band favourite. It is rare not to be included in the band's live setlist. During the spoken section at the beginning of the song, two Dutchmen, Oscar \\"Wilde\\" Vermeer and Patrick \\"The Brewer\\" Schrama (who met Tim Wheeler during a holiday in France), suggest that the song should have been called \\"Jack Names The Planet Nieuw-Vennep\\", given that, in their opinion, \\"Nieuw-Vennep\\" is a good name for a planet.

While the band has utilized humor as a basis for much of their lyrical content throughout their career, the humor on their previous album The Quickening had been rooted heavily in sarcasm and dealt with themes of nihilism, anarchism and apathy. By comparison, the humor in Hitler Bad, Vandals Good is more lighthearted, dealing with subjects such as girlfriends, fast food and hairstyles. The album contains two cover songs. \\"Come Out Fighting\\" was originally performed by fellow southern California punk rock band Pennywise and is dedicated to the memory of Pennywise bassist Jason Matthew Thirsk, who had committed suicide the previous year. \\"So Long, Farwell\\" is a Rodgers and Hammerstein song from the musical The Sound of Music, which has here been re-interpreted using electric guitar, bass and drums as the closing song on the album.

Club career =Early career= Born in Salvador, Robert began his professional career with Botafogo de Ribeir√£o Preto of Brazil, where he played in 2001. He made a move to S√£o Caetano in 2002. On 14 March 2003, Robert signed for Spartak Moscow on loan until the end of the 2003 season. After less than a season with Spartak, however, he returned to the Americas, signing with Club Atlas. He did exceptionally well in his first season with Atlas, scoring 16 goals in 21 games during the 2004 Clausura. He repeated his performance in the 2004 Apertura, leading them to the semifinals of the liguilla, where they were eliminated by UNAM Pumas. =PSV Eindhoven= Robert moved from to PSV Eindhoven for ¬£2 million, in January 2005. He made 32 league appearances, scoring 7 goals. During the UEFA Champions League quarter-final match against Olympique Lyonnais, he kept his nerves in check to deliver his decisive spot- kick which sent his team into a semi-final showdown with eventual losing finalist AC Milan. Although he hardly had the time to impress in the Champions League games, he played an excellent match against the Italian giants in the return leg at Philips Stadion, with PSV winning 3‚Äì1 and being ousted on away goals, and he himself came close to scoring when he cracked a long range shot which just missed the Milan left post by a matter of inches. =Real Betis= Robert was loaned by PSV to Real Betis for 1¬Ω years for ‚Ç¨1 million fee, arriving during the 2006 January transfer window. His signing was pivotal in the efforts of Betis to avoid relegation, scoring 7 La Liga goals, including two against Villarreal in a 2‚Äì1 win at El Madrigal and a winning penalty against bitter rivals Sevilla FC in a 2‚Äì1 win at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. Robert also scored one UEFA Cup goal against AZ Alkmaar. Due to the injury of fellow Brazilian and teammate Ricardo Oliveira, Robert's importance to Betis gradually grew, as he finished the club's top goalscorer for the season. His second season, however, was poorer (still managed 9 league goals in 29 appearances) and he eventually left Real Betis in July 2007, despite Betis excised the option to buy Robert from PSV for ‚Ç¨3.25 million on 4 April (effective on 1 July). Moreover, Robert refused to sign a contract, making the transfer collapsed. He joined Al-Ittihad as a free agent. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that despite the collapse of the transfer, Betis still had to pay ‚Ç¨1,562,500 as compensation to PSV. =CF Monterrey= On 22 August 2007, Robert signed for Saudi Arabian team Al-Ittihad. On 4 December 2007 Mexican media announced the transfer of Robert to the Mexican football club CF Monterrey, where he was paired up in attack with the Chilean Humberto \\"El Chupete\\" Suazo, formerly of club Colo Colo. =Tecos UAG= In Tecos, he had mild success and ended the tournament with only 5 goals. Tecos were eliminated in the quarterfinals and Robert de Pinho was sent to Club America. =Palmeiras= In July 2009, Robert joined Palmeiras and in the S√©rie A he scored 5 goals in 12 matches coming as a substitute in all of them. In 2009, he played a good role as a substitute in the league becoming an important player in the squad. In 2010 Robert remained with Palmeiras and became the key striker in the team. On 21 February 2010, he scored two headed goals against Paulista rival S√£o Paulo and Palmeiras won the match by 2‚Äì0; it was a great appearance for Robert after he had been criticised in the beginning of the Campeonato Paulista, where he scored already 5 goals. On 14 March 2010, Robert completed perfect hat-trick against Santos and Palmeiras won the match by 4‚Äì3; this game was marked by the different type of commemoration after goals. By the end of this game, Robert came to be known as \\"Blade do Palestra\\". The nickname refers to the great actor Wesley Snipes, that played Blade, the vampire-hunter, that in fact is a vampire and also a Robert look-alike. =Cruzeiro= On 3 June 2010, Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte signed the striker of Palmeiras property, but he arrived on a six-month-loan from CF Monterrey.Depois de Robert, Cruzeiro negocia com Far√≠as e n√£o descarta Rafael S√≥bis =Puebla= It was announced on 8 June 2011 that de Pinho was signed to Puebla.

It carries Shore Road and a walkway along the downstream side, over the Hutchinson River. The bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation. Crossing the mouth of the river, it is variously called Pelham Bay Bridge and Pelham Bridge. The BL45: to/from Eastchester in Westchester County operates over this bridge. Pelham Bridge opens frequently; in 2008, it opened a total of 1,446 times. The watercraft traffic under that bridge is greater than for any other drawbridge in the city. History The first bridge at the site, a stone bridge built in 1815, was destroyed in a storm on April 12, 1816. Another bridge was not built at the site for eighteen years. The current bridge replaced an older one that required constant, expensive maintenance. The new bridge was opened to traffic on October 15, 1908 before it was fully completed, in order to save costs on maintaining the old bridge. During construction, the water main for City Island and Pelham Bay Park had to be interrupted, so water was imported from New Rochelle, costing the city $5,323.93. The bridge was completed on February 17, 1909. at a total cost of $605,274.06. The bridge was reconstructed in 1985. A celebration of the bridge's centennial took place on October 28, 2008.

They speak the Lushootseed language. The tribal spelling of their name is Sdoh-doh-hohbsh, which means \\"lowland people\\" according to the last chief of the Snohomish tribe, Chief William Shelton. Some commentators believe a more accurate spelling in the Latin alphabet would be Sdohobich, as their language has no nasal consonants. Historians have debated the meaning of the name. Some believe it means \\"a style of union among those of the brave\\", while others interpret it as \\"Sleeping Waters.\\" Other possible meanings include \\"many people\\" and even \\"a warrior tribe.\\" Sometimes known as The Lowland People, the Snohomish have also been referred to as the Sinahomish (or Sneomuses).Ruby et al. 303 History Fishermen, hunters, and gatherers, the Snohomish formerly lived near the mouth of the Snohomish River, a Puget Sound tributary north of today's Marysville, on the southern tip of Camano Island, on Whidbey Island opposite today's city of Mukilteo, and along the Snohomish River as far east as today's town of Monroe. Among the Snohomish subdivisions in those locations, there were the Sdohobcs of the lower Snohomish River and Whidbey Island and the Sdocohobcs on the Snohomish River between Snohomish and Monroe. Other subdivisions were the N'Quentlamamishes (or Kwehtlamamishes) of the Pilchuck River. Today the river, the city, and a county all bear their name. In 1844, the Snohomish numbered 322. A decade later, their population was 350, indicating that a smallpox plague of the time probably did not affect them as much as it did other Native Americans of the Puget Sound area. In the 1980 census, there were 700 Snohomish, but by 2008 people identifying as Snohomish had increased to 1,200. When the Snohomish encountered the Hudson's Bay Company trader John Work in December 1824, they feared his party had come to attack them. They had long been in conflict with other tribes, such as the Klallams of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Cowichans of southeastern Vancouver Island. Once they realized the traders were friendly, a Snohomish warrior demonstrated how to kill the Cowichans, if they attacked. The Snohomish were among the tribes that traded at the Hudson's Bay Company Fort Nisqually, established in 1833 at the southern tip of Puget Sound. They also met Roman Catholic missionaries who entered their lands in the early 1840s. At the time of these contacts, the Snohomish were governed by headmen, each leader having influence over several villages. The traditional homeland of the Snohomish now constitutes Snohomish County. It was named in their honor, since they were the first inhabitants. Legal status Many Snohomish are now enrolled in the federally recognized Tulalip Tribes of Washington. The Tulalip Reservation is west of the city of Marysville. However, most live elsewhere, including in the cities. The Tulalip Confederation of Tribes Reservation was created under the Point Elliott Treaty, and on December 23, 1873 was enlarged by an executive order from 22,489.91 acres to 24,320 acres. It was in Snohomish lands, but was also intended to be shared by the Skykomish, the Snoqualmies, and the Stillaguamish. Early in the reservation period, Indian agent Reverend Eugene Casmir Chirouse, O.M.I., used different means to help the Native Americans survive the difficult transition. Many Snohomish left the reservation because the overcrowding that reduced their ability to survive in their forced environment. In the 1870s, even more left due to oppressive government policies that destroyed their traditional culture, language, way of life, and ability to earn their livelihood as they always had on their historical ancestral grounds.Ruby et al. 304 Snohomish members are seeking federal recognition as a tribe. They argue that the Treaty of Point Elliott (1855) explicitly recognized them as a tribe, since they are listed by name. =Point Elliott Treaty of 1855= Nine Snohomish headmen signed the Point Elliott Treaty which was written by a council held for 1855 near present-day Mukilteo. About 350 Snohomish and their allies, the Snoqualmies, were represented by Chief Patkanim, who had originally been hostile to Americans, but had become impressed by their potential power. Patkanim allied himself with the Americans during the Indian War of 1855-1856, while most of the other Snohomish leaders had remained neutral. This neutrality prompted an Indian agent in February 1856 to recommend that Isaac Stevens, territorial governor and Superintendent Indian affairs, disbanded the tribe, since they were \\"doing nothing for us.\\" As a result, the Snohomish and other neutral Indians were removed to other areas on the Puget Sound, including Fox and Whidbey Islands and Port Gamble in the Kitsap Peninsula.Ruby et al. 303-304 Because of the decades of struggle for survival by the Snohomish nation, historical accounts and records do not tell if the Indigenous Peoples who signed the Point Elliott Treaty really understood the contents and consequences of the treaty. Article 7 of the Point Elliott Treaty allows the President of the United States to subsequently act on behalf of the tribes affected by the agreement: > The President may hereafter, when in his opinion the interests of the > Territory shall require and the welfare of the said Indians be promoted, > remove them from either or all of the special reservations herein before > make to the said general reservation, or such other suitable place within > said Territory as he may deem fit, on remunerating them for their > improvements and the expenses of such removal, or may consolidate them with > other friendly tribes or bands; and he may further at his discretion cause > the whole or any portion of the lands hereby reserved, or of such other land > as may be selected in lieu thereof, to be surveyed into lots, and assign the > same to such individuals or families as are willing to avail themselves of > the privilege, and will locate on the same as a permanent home on the same > terms and subject to the same regulations as are provided in the sixth > article of the treaty with the Omahas, so far as the same may be applicable. > Any substantial improvements heretofore made by any Indian, and which he > shall be compelled to abandon in consequence of this treaty, shall be valued > under the direction of the President and payment made accordingly > therefor.http://www.goia.wa.gov/treaties/treaties/pointelliot.htm Notable Snohomish * Boeda Strand, basket weaver * Snah-talc, or Bonaparte, sub-chief of Snohomish * Chief Patkanim * William Shelton, chief * Tommy Yarr, former NFL player and Notre Dame Fighting Irish football captain Notes  References  Ruby, Robert H., John A.

Hallstatt Amber Choker necklace. 19th century illustration of Hallstatt swords. In archaeology a type site (also known as a type-site or typesite) is a site that is considered the model of a particular archaeological culture. For example, the type site of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A culture is Jericho, in the West Bank. A type site is also often the eponym (the site after which the culture is named). For example, the type site of the pre-Celtic/Celtic Bronze Age Hallstatt culture is the lakeside village of Hallstatt, Austria. In geology the term is used similarly for a site considered to be typical of a particular rock formation etc. A type site contains artifacts, in an assemblage, that are typical of that culture. Type sites are often the first or foundational site discovered about the culture they represent. The use of this term is therefore similar to that of the specimen type in biology (see biological types) or locus typicus (type locality) in geology.

He is generally considered the one to whom much of the credit can be given for transforming Real Madrid into one of the most successful football clubs in Spain and in Europe. The team's current stadium is named in his honour. He was the club's President for 35 years, from 11 September 1943 until 2 June 1978.Santiago Bernabeu Real Madrid C.F. Retrieved 13 February 2010. Pre-Civil War Bernab√©u was born in Almansa, Albacete, Spain. His family moved to Madrid when he was very young, and Bernab√©u himself joined the Real Madrid junior ranks in 1909 at age 14, after being a regular spectator at their matches for years. Bernab√©u wore the captain's armband for years, playing as a striker before retiring from playing in 1926. He continued to be associated with the club until 1935, first as manager of the first team, then as a director and later becoming assistant manager. Civil War With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, professional football ceased to be played in Spain. During the war he fought on the side of the Nationalists as a soldier under the general Agust√≠n Mu√±oz Grandes. Post-Civil War When the war ended and football began again in Spain, Bernab√©u found at Real Madrid what was, for all intents and purposes, a dead club. The old administration (several had been killed or disappeared during the war) and even some of the club's trophies from their early years had been stolen. What was more, at the time the establishment club was Atl√©tico Madrid (renamed Atl√©tico Aviaci√≥n, the Air-Force's team) and Real Madrid did not initially receive any government help in rebuilding. Bernab√©u proceeded to spend the next several months finding and contacting former players, directors, and club members, eventually restructuring the club. In 1943, after fan violence following a Real Madrid victory over FC Barcelona the government imposed a solomonic solution, forcing the Presidents of both clubs to resign, and Bernab√©u was elected President of Real Madrid ‚Äì a position he would occupy until his death on 2 June 1978. Success did not come immediately, however. The club was still in very poor shape and other clubs, such as the aforementioned Atl√©tico, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao had very strong teams. Bernab√©u began to implant his ideas. He restructured the club at all levels, in what would become the normal operating structure of professional clubs in the future, giving every section and level of the club independent technical teams and recruiting people who were ambitious and visionary in their own right, such as Raimundo Saporta. He then endeavoured to build what would become the stadium that today bears his name, at the time the largest stadium in all of Europe, it was remarked as being \\"too much of a stadium for so little a club\\". The Ciudad Deportiva, built so that the players could train without destroying the stadium's pitch, was also constructed during these years. Finally, he embarked upon an ambitious strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent of them being the signing of Alfredo Di St√©fano, and built the world's first truly multinational side. During Bernab√©u's presidency many of Real Madrid's most legendary names played for the club, including Molowny, Mu√±oz, Di St√©fano, Gento, Rial, Santamar√≠a, Kopa, Pusk√°s, Amancio, Pirri, Netzer, Santillana, Juanito, Camacho, del Bosque and many more. Influence in Europe and legacy In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by the L'√âquipe journalist Gabriel Hanot and building upon the Copa Latina (a tournament involving clubs from France, Spain, Portugal and Italy), Bernab√©u met in the Ambassador Hotel in Paris with Bedrignan and Gustav Sebes and created what was at first a loosely constructed exhibition tournament played among invited teams, but which over time developed into what is today the Champions League. Under the administration of UEFA, it is the world's premier club tournament. At the time of his death, Bernab√©u had been the club's president for 35 years, during which his club won 1 Intercontinental Cup, 6 European Cups, 16 League titles, 6 Spanish Cups, 2 Latin Cups and 1 Copa Eva Duarte. He died in 1978, while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. In his honour FIFA decreed three days of mourning during the tournament. In 2002, he was posthumously awarded the FIFA Order of Merit. See also *List of one-club men References .

Biography Kerr was born in Evanston, Illinois and earned both a B.A. and M.A. from Northwestern University., after graduation from St. George H.S. also in Evanston. He was a regular film critic for the St. George High School newspaper while a student there, and was also a critic for the Evanston News Index. He was the editor of the high school newspaper and yearbook.\\"Walter and Jean Kerr Papers, circa 1920-1993\\" Wisconsin Historical Society, accessed February 14, 2020 He taught speech and drama at The Catholic University of America. After writing criticism for Commonweal he became a theater critic for the New York Herald Tribune in 1951. When that paper folded, he then began writing theater reviews for The New York Times in 1966, writing for the next seventeen years. He married Jean Kerr (n√©e Collins) on August 9, 1943. She was also a writer. Together, they wrote the musical Goldilocks (1958), which won two Tony Awards. They also collaborated on Touch and Go (1949) and King of Hearts (1954). They had six children. Kerr died from congestive heart failure on October 9, 1996. He was portrayed pseudonymously by David Niven in the 1960 film Please Don't Eat the Daisies, based on Jean Kerr's best-selling collection of humorous essays. Critiquing shows Kerr was well known for panning musicals that were musically ambitious. =Stephen Sondheim= Many of the shows he critiqued were those of Stephen Sondheim. About Sondheim's Company, Kerr wrote that it was too cold, cynical and distant for his taste, though he \\"admitted to admiring large parts of the show.\\"Miletich, p.51 About Sondheim's Follies, he wrote \\" 'Follies' is intermissionless and exhausting, an extravaganza that becomes tedious for two simple reasons: Its extravagances have nothing to do with its pebble of a plot; and the plot, which could be wrapped up in approximately two songs, dawdles through 22 before it declares itself done... Mr. Sondheim may be too much a man of the seventies, too present-tense sophisticated... The effort to bind it up inhibits the crackling, open-ended, restlessly varied surges of sound he devised with such distinction for Company.\\" Kerr, Walter. \\"Follies\\", The New York Times, p.

The New York Times, \\"Who Could Resist These Women?\\", p. 119, March 4, 1973 He expressed mixed sentiments about Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, praising the music but deeming it too lilting for the show's grisly subject; his conclusion- \\"What is this musical about?\\"Kerr, Walter. The New York Times, \\"Is 'Sweeney' on Target?\\", 1979 He wrote a follow-up article on his observation that the musical contained a plot from Moli√®re's The School for Wives, posing the question who, of all of the authors who had revised the tale of Sweeney Todd over the years, had put the plot into the story.Kerr, Walter. The New York Times, \\"Who Sneaked the Moli√®re into 'Sweeney Todd'?\\", 1979 Nevertheless, in 1977, he wrote of Sondheim \\"I needn't tell you that Stephen Sondheim is, both musically and lyrically, the most sophisticated composer now working for the Broadway theater.\\"Kerr, Walter. \\"Broadway is Alive with the Sound of Music\\", The New York Times p.

Enchanted Evenings (2004), Oxford University Press US, , p. 245 In his review of the original 1956 Broadway production of Candide, he wrote that it was a \\"really spectacular disaster\\".Candide at Bernstein\\", leonardbernstein.com, accessed July 4, 2009 However, in reviewing the 1973 revival of Candide he wrote that it was a \\"most satisfying resurrection. [...] 'Candide' may at last have stumbled into the best of all possible productions... The show is now a carousel and we are on it quite safely... The design of the unending chase is so firm, the performers are so secure in their climbing and tumbling...that we are able to join the journey and still see it with the detachment that Voltaire prescribes.\\"Kerr, Walter. \\"Best of All Candides?\\", The New York Times, p. 55, December 30, 1973 =Frank Loesser= Of Frank Loesser's \\"musical with a lot of music\\" [sic. opera], The Most Happy Fella he wrote: \\"the evening at the Imperial is finally heavy with its own inventiveness, weighted down with the variety and fulsomeness of a genuinely creative appetite.

Frank Loesser (2008), Yale University Press, , p.161 =Other criticism= Kerr was also notable for his lack of enthusiasm regarding the plays of Samuel Beckett. For instance, of Beckett's Waiting For Godot he wrote \\"The play, asking for a thousand readings, has none of its own to give. It is a veil rather than a revelation. It wears a mask rather than a face.\\" Notoriously he is credited with one of the world's shortest reviews, \\"Me no Leica\\" for John Van Druten's I Am a Camera in the New York Herald Tribune, December 31, 1951.Botto, Louis.\\"Quotable Critics\\" Playbill, May 28, 2008 Awards and honors Walter Kerr won a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1978 for \\"articles on the theater\\".

It includes the usage, consumption, creation, and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms, and rituals that the objects create or take part in. Some scholars also include other intangible phenomena that include sound, smell and events, while some even consider language and media as part of it. The term is most commonly used in archaeological and anthropological studies, to define material or artifacts as they are understood in relation to specific cultural and historic contexts, communities, and belief systems. Material cultural can be described as any object that humans use to survive, define social relationships, represent facets of identity, or benefit peoples' state of mind, social, or economic standing. Material culture is contrasting to symbolic culture, which includes nonmaterial symbols, beliefs, and social constructs. The scholarly analysis of material culture, which can include both human made and natural or altered objects, is called material culture studies. It is an interdisciplinary field and methodology that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the social sciences and humanities such as art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, historic preservation, folklore, archival science, literary criticism and museum studies, among others.  Material value  Roman coin, the aureus Research in several areas looks into the reasons for perceiving an object as having meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value. A well-known related theory is Kahneman's endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people infuse objects they own with a higher value than they do if they do not own the object. The endowment effect is found to occur as soon as an item is acquired and the effect increases over time. Another way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time or space or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience. Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships. Researchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, \\"gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver.\\" Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver. According to Mauss, the giver never really leaves the gift but becomes part of the receiver's future by inserting the gift into their life. A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people. History Finding tools of the past is considered a way to discover the level of development of a culture Material culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of anthropology and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came. During the \\"golden age\\" of museum-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture. The field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates to the 1990s. The Journal of Material Culture began publishing in 1996. Collecting habits date back hundreds of years. Contributors Leslie White was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of cultural evolution, sociocultural evolution, and especially neoevolutionism and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He was president of the American Anthropological Association (1964). He wrote The Science of Culture in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials. American anthropologist James Deetz, known for his work in the field of historical archaeology, wrote the book \\"In Small Things Forgotten\\" in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects. Ian M. G. Quimby's Material Culture and the Study of American Life, written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education. Thomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame, wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book Artifacts and the American Past, Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts. Gerd Koch, associated with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, is known for his studies on the material culture of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Santa Cruz Islands. During his early field work in 1951 to 1952, Koch developed techniques in the recording of culture, including the use of tape recorders and cinematographic cameras. Archaeology An archaeologist searches for evidence of glass objects among ruins Archaeology is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history. An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of the artifacts from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history. With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture. Beginning in the European Renaissance and the culture's fascination with classical antiquities, the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of archaeological theory, such as trans-cultural diffusion, processual archaeology, and post-processual archaeology. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, historical archaeology, cognitive archaeology, and cultural ecology. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results. Anthropology Anthropology is the study of humans both past and present Anthropology is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space. In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used. The first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was Lewis Henry Morgan, in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on kinship and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society. Later in the 19th century, Franz Boas brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society. At the same time in France, √âmile Durkheim wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the social facts that functions as a coercive force to maintain solidarity in a society. Claude L√©vi-Strauss, in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical fieldwork. According to L√©vi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space. Also in the 20th century, Mary Douglas thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it. Marvin Harris, a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of cultural materialism and said that all aspects of society have material causes. Sociology Any object created to suit humans can represent a form of material culture In archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior. The social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made. An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning. Heritage industry These statues are a form of cultural heritage in India Museums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the heritage industry. Defined as \\"the business of managing places that are important to an area's history and encouraging people to visit them,\\" the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications. That relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the humanities take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows curators, researchers, and directors to conserve material culture's legacy. Current production Material culture of the present day can take many forms Some observers advocate intentionally altering the material cultures created by current civilizations. For example, waste reduction advocates within environmentalism advocate teaching design approaches, such as cradle-to-cradle design and appropriate technology. Anti-consumerism advocates encourage consuming less (thus creating fewer artifacts), engaging in more do-it-yourself projects and self-sufficiency (changing the quality of artifacts produced), and localism impacts the geographic distribution and uniformity of artifacts.

The surname dates as far back as the 12th century in Westmoreland, and is also found at an early date in the Scottish counties of Ayrshire and Lanarkshire.  Etymology  The surname Strickland (early forms including Stirkeland) is derived from the place-name Stercaland, given to a manor in the former county of Westmorland near Penrith, Cumbria. The place- name is Old English, from stirc, styr(i}c or steorc bullock, and land, a piece of land or pasture.  History  Sizergh Castle, built c. 1350, is the Strickland family seat Coat of Arms of Strickland of Gilsland: Sable, three escallops argent The earliest known Strickland was a late-12th century landholder named Walter of Castlecarrock, who married Christian of Letheringham, an heiress to the landed estate that covered the area where the villages of Great Strickland and Little Strickland are now. After this marriage Walter became known as Walter de Strickland, spelt in various ways. When Sir William de Stirkeland (1242‚Äì1305) married Elizabeth Deincourt (or d'Eyncourt), Sizergh Castle became the seat of this Strickland gentry family. A descendant, Thomas Strykeland is said to have carried the banner of St. George at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. They also had a family chapel in the Kendal Parish Church (Holy Trinity), and both Kendal and Penrith have main roads called Stricklandgate (The 'gate' element is from Old Norse gata, street). Other local landmarks include Strickland Wood, Warton near Carnforth. They also gave their name to one of their properties, a settlement that first appeared on the west side of present day Kendal with a Motte and Bailey fortification on it that became known as Kirkbie Strickland (Kirkbie is from Old Norse Kirkju, church, and by, village.). A Strickland gentry family seated at Gilsland was granted a coat of arms blazoned: Sable, three escallops argent, meaning \\"three white scallops on a black field\\".

These red dwarf stars orbit each other every 44.6 years. Description The larger, primary star is designated component A, while the secondary, smaller star is labeled component B. Component A has about 27% of the Sun's mass and 35% of the Sun's radius. Component B has about 18% of the Sun's mass and 24% of the Sun's radius. The data is from the Vizier II/224 catalogue. Component B is a flare star and has been given the variable star designation \\"DO Cephei\\". It is an irregular flare that typically doubles in brightness and then returns to normal over an 8-minute period. On average, the two stars are separated by 9.5 AUs, which is roughly the average distance of Saturn from the Sun. However, their eccentric mutual orbit causes their distance to vary between 5.5 AUs at periastron, to 13.5 at apastron. This system is orbiting through the Milky Way at a distance from the core that varies from 7‚Äì9 kpc with an orbital eccentricity of 0.126‚Äì0.130. The closest approach to the Sun will occur in about 88,600 years when this system will come within 1.95 parsecs. Considering the orbit of the members of Kruger 60, detecting an exoplanet through radial velocity could prove difficult, as its orbit would be inclined only 13 degrees from our point of view, and create 1/5th as strong a radial velocity signal as an exoplanet orbiting edge-on from the point of view of the Solar System. Origin of 2I/Borisov  Kruger 60 has been proposed as the origin of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov (formerly named C/2019 Q4 (Borisov)) by Dybczy≈Ñski, Kr√≥likowska, and Wysocza≈Ñska. These authors have from other work a list of stars and stellar systems that can potentially act as perturbers of the Oort cloud comets, and searched it for a past close proximity of 2I/Borisov at a very small relative velocity. While hampered by continuing uncertainty about the orbit of 2I/Borisov and particularly its non-gravitational acceleration (due to cometary outgassing), they reach a conclusion that 1 Myr ago 2I/Borisov passed Kruger 60 at a small distance of 1.74 pc while having an extremely small relative velocity of 3.43 km/s. Perturbations of the 2I/Borisov's incoming orbit altered the intersection distance with relatively small changes in the relative velocity. At the time of publication, the results were considered preliminary as the orbit of 2I/Borisov was still being improved by new observations.

Career Davidson designed the Swoosh in 1971 while a graphic design student at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. She started as a journalism major but switched to design after taking a design course to \\"fill an empty elective.\\" She attained a bachelor's in graphic design in 1971. Phil Knight, who was teaching an accounting class at the university, overheard Davidson say that she couldn't afford oil painting supplies and asked her to do some work for what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, Inc. Knight offered Davidson a job in creating charts and graphs for his meetings with Japanese footwear executives. Her success with this work led to Davidson designing posters, ads, and flyers for the company. In 1971, Knight and his co-founder needed a logo for a new line of running shoes they were getting ready to introduce. They asked Davidson to design a stripe (industry term for a shoe logo) that \\"had something to do with movement\\". Davidson worked on her ideas by drawing on a piece of tissue over a drawing of a shoe. She gave him five different designs, one of which was the Swoosh which resembles a wing and hints at Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Needing to choose a logo in order to meet looming production deadlines, Knight settled on the Swoosh after rejecting four other designs by Davidson. At the time, he stated of the logo, \\"I don't love it, but it will grow on me.\\" For her services, the company paid her $35, which, if adjusted for inflation for 2018, would be the value equivalent of about $217. Davidson continued working for Blue Ribbon Sports (it officially became Nike, Inc. in 1972) until the design demands of the growing company exceeded one person's capacity. In 1976, the company hired its first external advertising agency, John Brown and Partners, and Davidson went on to work on other clients' needs. In September 1983, nearly three years after the company went public, Knight invited Davidson to a company reception. There, he presented her with chocolate swooshes, a diamond ring made of gold and engraved with the Swoosh, and an envelope filled with 500 shares (estimated to be worth $1,000,000 as of 2015) of Nike stock that has split into 32,000 shares as of 2016. Of the gift, Davidson says, \\"this was something rather special for Phil to do, because I originally billed him and he paid that invoice.\\" Davidson went on to be known as \\"The Logo Lady\\". In 1995, Nike removed the word \\"Nike\\" from the logo; the Swoosh now stands alone as the brand's logo. Davidson retired in 2000, and now engages in hobbies and volunteer work, including weekly duties at the Ronald McDonald House at Legacy Emanuel Hospital & Health Center in Oregon.

The screenplay comes from the pen of his father Zdenƒõk Svƒõr√°k. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1991 and is considered to belong among the best Czechoslovak films ever. A prequel, Barefoot, was released in 2017. Plot Shortly after World War II, in 1945‚Äì46, in one of the suburbs of Prague (the film was shot in Michle), Eda Souƒçek attends a boys' elementary school where he belongs to a class with a complete lack of discipline. After the class drives their teacher Maxov√° to a mental breakdown during one of her classes, the schoolmaster has to implement special measures. A new male teacher, Igor Hn√≠zdo, is employed, who is said to be a great war hero. Authoritative Hn√≠zdo immediately introduces corporal punishment, which, as he explains, is not normally allowed but the school has received an exception from the Ministry of Education as a result of their dreadful behaviour. Despite his strict methods, the boys soon become charmed by the man. They love his battlefront stories and the fact that he is always armed and wears a uniform. Eda sees him as the very opposite of his own father, whom he considers to be too cowardly. Hn√≠zdo makes the same positive impression on the townspeople (including Eda's mother). Nevertheless, his persona is also surrounded by many controversies. For example, his war heroism is disputed as he is unable to provide any accurate information about his military service. There is even an unconfirmed rumour that Hn√≠zdo was only guarding goats during the war. But the boys from his class ignore all such criticisms and even fight those who are spreading the rumours. Hn√≠zdo's reputation suffers after he is accused of having a sexual relationship with local twins who attend a girls' school in the same area. He is forced to leave because this is not the first time he has been involved in a similar affair. The formerly unmanageable boys begin to defend Hn√≠zdo and call for his return. The accusation is finally withdrawn and Hn√≠zdo comes back to the class. He states that the way they were dealing with the accusation is a proof that the physical punishments are no longer necessary.

Clark is a charter recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award for \\"First Personal Computer\\". At Lincoln Laboratory Clark moved to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1952 where he joined the Project Whirlwind staff. There he was involved in the development of the Memory Test Computer (MTC), a testbed for ferrite core memory that was to be used in Whirlwind. His sessions with the MTC, \\"lasting hours rather than minutes\\" helped form his views that computers were to be used as tools on demand for those who needed them. That view carried over into his designs for the TX-0 and TX-2 and the LINC. He expresses this view clearly here: > ...both of the Cambridge machines, Whirlwind and MTC, had been completely > committed to the air defense effort and were no longer available for general > use. The only surviving computing system paradigm seen by M.I.T. students > and faculty was that of a very large International Business Machine in a > tightly sealed Computation Center: the computer not as tool, but as demigod. > Although we were not happy about giving up the TX-0, it was clear that > making this small part of Lincoln's advanced technology available to a > larger M.I.T. community would be an important corrective step. Clark is > one of the fathers of the personal computer... he was the architect of both > the TX-0 and TX-2 at Lincoln Labs. He believed that \\"a computer should be > just another piece of lab equipment.\\" At a time when most computers were > huge remote machines operated in batch mode, he advocated far more > interactive access. He practiced what he preached, even though it often > meant bucking current \\"wisdom\\" and authority (in a 1981 lecture, he > mentioned that he had the distinction of being, \\"the only person to have > been fired three times from MIT for insubordination\\".) Clark's design for the TX-2 \\"integrated a number of man-machine interfaces that were just waiting for the right person to show up to use them in order to make a computer that was 'on-line'. When selecting a PhD thesis topic, an MIT student named Ivan Sutherland looked at the simple cathode ray tube and light pen on the TX-2's console and thought one should be able to draw on the computer. Thus was born Sketchpad, and with it, interactive computer graphics.\\" At Washington University LINC home computer In 1964, Clark moved to Washington University in St. Louis where he and Charles Molnar worked on macromodules, which were fundamental building blocks in the world of asynchronous computing. The goal of the macromodules was to provide a set of basic building blocks that would allow computer users to build and extend their computers without requiring any knowledge of electrical engineering. The New York Times series on the history of the personal computer had this to say in an article on August 19, 2001, \\"How the Computer Became Personal\\": > In the pantheon of personal computing, the LINC, in a sense, came first‚Äîmore > than a decade before Ed Roberts made PC's affordable for ordinary people. > Work started on the Linc, the brainchild of the M.I.T. physicist Wesley A. > Clark, in May 1961, and the machine was used for the first time at the > National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, MD, the next year to > analyze a cat's neural responses. > Each Linc had a tiny screen and keyboard and comprised four metal modules, > which together were about as big as two television sets, set side by side > and tilted back slightly. The machine, a 12-bit computer, included a one- > half megahertz processor. Lincs sold for about $43,000‚Äîa bargain at the > time‚Äîand were ultimately made commercially by Digital Equipment, the first > minicomputer company. Fifty Lincs of the original design were built. Role in ARPANET Clark had a key insight in the planning for the ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet). In April 1967, he suggested to Larry Roberts the idea of using separate small computers (later named Interface Message Processors) as a way of forming a message switching network and reducing load on the local computers. The same idea had earlier been independently developed by Donald Davies for the NPL network. The concept of packet switching was introduced to the ARPANET later at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. Post-Nixon China trip In 1972, shortly after President Nixon's trip to China, Clark accompanied five other computer scientists to China for three weeks to \\"tour computer facilities and to discuss computer technology with Chinese experts in Shanghai and Beijing. Officially, the trip was seen by the Chinese in two lights: as a step in reestablishing the long-interrupted friendship between the two nations and as a step in opening channels for technical dialogue.\\" The trip was organized by his colleague Severo Ornstein from MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Washington University. The other members of the group were: Thomas E. Cheatham, Anatol Holt, Alan J. Perlis and Herbert A. Simon. Clark in 2002 Death He was 88 when he died on February 22, 2016, at his home in Brooklyn due to severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Career  Hardy was born in London in 1949 and educated at Lancing College, where his contemporaries included Christopher Hampton and Tim Rice. He went on to study classics, and then philosophy and psychology, at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he wrote a BPhil thesis in the philosophy of mind entitled ‚ÄòSubjective Experiences‚Äô,https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/lists/unpublished/BPhil- searchable.pdf. later expanded into a doctoral thesis.https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/lists/unpublished/DPhil- searchable.pdf. It was at Wolfson that Hardy met Wolfson‚Äôs then President, Isaiah Berlin. Hardy's first edited volume was a collection of writings by Arnold Mallinson, an eccentric Oxford clergyman with whom he lodged for seven years. He published this work under his own imprint (Robert Dugdale).https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/dugpubs/mallinsonbooks.htm. While still a student, Hardy also composed a number of musical pieces, which he published many years later as Tunes: Collected Musical Juvenilia (2003).https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/dugpubs/tunes.html. In addition to publishing under the pseudonym Robert Dugdale from 1974 to 2005,https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/dugpubs/index.html. Hardy worked for thirteen years (1977‚Äì90) as an editor at Oxford University Press, first editing and commissioning in the General Books Department, then commissioning academic books as Senior Editor, Political and Social Studies. At OUP in 1980, inspired by Isaiah Berlin's insistence on the crucial role of individual thinkers in the history of ideas, he founded the Past Masters series (now absorbed into the Very Short Introductions series). His wish to publish a work of popular philosophy, Making Names, by Andrew Malcolm, was not endorsed by OUP. This was the subject of Malcolm's landmark legal action against OUP for breach of contract. Hardy's account of this episode is told in his reviewhttp://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~hardy/lists/publishedwritings/malcolm.html. of Malcolm‚Äôs book about the case. Hardy has been a Fellow of Wolfson College since 1990 (an Honorary Fellow since 2015). At Wolfson he met Bryan Magee, came to know him well, and became his executor. When Magee died in 2019, he organised a celebration of his life at Keble College, Oxford (where Magee was an undergraduate), which was recorded on film. A shortened version of the film may be viewed online.  Isaiah Berlin  Isaiah Berlin, though a towering intellectual figure at the time of his death, was at one stage not regarded as having published very extensively. Hardy's research revealed that Berlin had published well over 150 pieces by the late 1970s. Hardy's editing of Berlin's essays made Berlin's most important work widely available. In 1990 Hardy abandoned his career in publishing to work full-time on Berlin's unpublished essays, lectures, and correspondence. He has (co-)edited eighteen volumes of Berlin's writings (plus new editions of thirteen of these volumes), as well as a four-volume edition of Berlin's letters, and two books and a pamphlet about Berlin. In 2018 he published a memoir of his work with and on Berlin. Reviewing the book for 'Best Books of 2018' in the Guardian, John Banville wrote: ‚ÄòHenry Hardy has self-effacingly devoted the larger part of his professional career to the editing, promoting and celebrating of the work of Isaiah Berlin. In Search of Isaiah Berlin: A Literary Adventure (I.B.Tauris) looks back over his long labours of love with fondness, a fine dry wit and a light salting of justified irritation at those entrusted with Berlin‚Äôs posthumous affairs. The second part consists of Hardy‚Äôs own philosophical response to Berlin‚Äôs theories on matters such as plurality, religious belief and our shared human nature. A wonderful book on a wonderful subject.‚ÄôFor this and other reviews see http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/onib/books.html#ISIB. In June 2015 Hardy delivered the 7th Isaiah Berlin Memorial Lecture in Riga. Opening remarks were made by Ivars Ijabs, Chair of the Board of the Foundation for an Open Society.  Family  In 1979 Hardy married the historian of medicine Anne Wilkinson. They were separated in 2004, and divorced in 2012. They have two children, Ellen (b. 1983) and Michael (b. 1985). Hardy married Mary Merry in 2013, and now lives with her and her younger daughter Beth in Wirral.

It is recognizable because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, with the exception of the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The top jaw has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb- shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver- gray to brown in order to blend with the dark water and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with the sunlit water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black & white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins. It is also known as sevengill shark or simply sevengill and was formerly known as cow shark and mud shark; it is called sevengill due to its seven gill slits. Because of this, it was listed along with the sharpnose sevengill shark (Heptranchias perlo) by Guinness World Records as having the most gill slits. It is similar to the sharpnose sevengill shark but the latter has a pointed snout and lacks spots on its dorsal surface. The sevengill species are also related to ancient sharks as fossils from the Jurassic Period (200 to 145 million years ago) also had seven gills. As recently as the 1930s and 1940s, the shark was targeted by fisheries along the coast of California and, once the commercial fishery receded, recreational fishing of the shark started in the 1980s and 1990s. Taxonomy =Name= The genus name Notorynchus a portmanteau is derived from the Ancient Greek ŒΩ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ (n√¥ton, meaning \\"back\\") prefixed to the Ancient Greek ·ø•·ø†ÃÅŒ≥œáŒøœÇ (rh√∫nkhos, meaning ‚Äúsnout‚Äù). It has been interpreted that this refers to the spots on the broadnose sevengill's dorsal. The specific epithet cepedianus is derived from a variation of the name Lacepede, which refers to Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de, a French naturalist during the late 18th and early 19th century. Altogether, the scientific name as a whole literally means \\"Lacepede's back snout\\". The common name \\"broadnose sevengill shark\\" refers to the seven gill slits the species possesses and the shape of its snout. Sometimes, the name is shortened to \\"sevengill shark\\" or simply \\"sevengill\\". However, a variety of other common names are known in many languages. Other known common names in English include the bluntnose sevengill shark, broad-snout, cowshark, ground shark, seven-gill cowshark, seven-gilled shark, spotted cow shark, spotted seven-gill shark, and Tasmanian tiger shark. Common names from other languages include ca√ß√£o-bruxa (Portuguese), ca√±abota gata, gatita, tibur√≥n de 7 gallas, tibur√≥n pinto, and tollo fume (Spanish), ebisuzame and minami-ebisuzame (Japanese), gevlekte zevenkieuwshaai (Dutch), kammz√§hner and Siebenkiemiger Pazifischer Kammz√§hner (German), koeihaai (Afrikaans), k'wet'then√©chte (Salish), minami-ebisuzame (Japanese), platneus-sewekiefhaai (Afrikaans), platnez and requin malais (French), siedmioszpar plamisty (Polish), and tuatini (Maori). Description The length at birth is while the mature male length is and mature female length is around . The maximum length found is . The shark is large and active and has a large head but small eyes and snout. The shark has one dorsal fin at the back of the body that spans from the insertion to the tops of the pelvic fins. The broadnose sevengill shark is also known as sevengill shark or simply sevengill and was formerly known as cow shark and mud shark; it is called sevengill due to its seven gill slits. Because of this, it was listed along with the sharpnose sevengill shark by Guinness World Records as having the most gill slits.

Maisey AMNH.jpgCT scan of the broadnose sevengill shark's braincase Range and habitat The broadnose sevengill has so far been found in the western Pacific Ocean off China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the eastern Pacific Ocean off Canada, United States and Chile, and the southern Atlantic Ocean off Argentina and South Africa. In San Francisco, California, it is significantly found in the San Francisco Bay particularly near the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. Large, old individuals tend to live in deep offshore environments as far down as . However, most individuals live in either the deep channels of bays, or in the shallower waters of continental shelves and estuaries. These sharks are mainly benthic in nature, cruising along the sea floor and making an occasional foray to the surface.Compagno, Leonardo, Dando, Marc and Fowler, Sarah. Sharks of the World. Princeton University Press. 2005. p. 67-68 Behavior A broadnose sevengill shark in \\"Shark Alley\\", South Africa An opportunistic predator, the broadnose sevengill preys on a great variety of animals and has been found at a depth of in offshore waters. It has been found to feed on sharks (including gummy shark, one of its main prey, and cowsharks), rays, chimaeras, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony fishes and carrion and will also feed on whatever it finds such as shark egg cases, sea snails and remains of rats and humans. Research in 2003 found that its diet consisted of 30% mammals with a frequency of occurrence of 35%. It is a frequent top predator in shallow waters and has comb-like teeth, with the upper teeth having slender, smooth edged cusps to swallow small enough prey whole and lower teeth broad enough to bite prey to pieces. These sharks occasionally hunt in packs to take down larger prey, using tactics such as stealth to succeed. After feeding, it slowly digests the food for several hours and days and can go weeks until eating again. Large predatory sharks such as the great white shark can be a threat and cannibalism among this shark has also been recorded. The species have also been observed being preyed upon by Orcas in False Bay on the South African coast.http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/336785/shark-eating-killer-whales- lurking-in-cape-town-s-waters When not highly active, it hunts stealthily while making very little movement except for moving its caudal fin until dashing to strike. It can be one of the most abundant predators in coastal waters in summer and, in southeast Tasmania, there is a high abundance of elasmobranches including the gummy shark in coastal regions in summer. In New Zealand, it is also one of the most common inshore sharks. While it is mainly a nocturnal forager, it may opportunistically feed on prey casually found during the day, however, research in 2010, found even amounts of activity during day and night. During this research, this shark was consistently detected at all depths from bottom to near surface whereas it was the substrate during the day. It also found that as Norfolk Bay does not have adequate shelter cover, this species may use group formation to avoid predation. This sevengill, like all other members of Hexanchiformes, is ovoviviparous. The broadnose sevengill lives for about 30 years although the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in Washington state lists a maximum of 49 years. with the male maturing at 4 to 5 years and the female 11 to 21 years; the average reproductive age for a female is 20 to 25 years. After a 12-month gestation period, the female moves to a shallow bay or estuary to give birth between April and May to a large litter of between 82 and 95 pups, measuring . In 2004 and 2005, along with research for the sand tiger shark, there was research for the broadnose sevengill shark for development techniques for semen collection and artificial insemination to potentially increase breeding and lower overreliance on natural mating. Research in 2010 found that this shark has very poorly calcified vertebrae that cannot be used for age and growth estimations. Research in 2009 in R√≠a Deseado (RD) and Bah√≠a San Juli√°n (SJ), Argentina found that females were larger in RD than SJ and the heaviest female in RD was 70 kg while it was 36.9 kg in SJ. For the males, the heaviest in RD was 40 kg while it was 32.5 in SJ. Both locations also found the most significant to occur December and January. Research in 2014 also found that for the first time, reproductive hormones levels were found in the broadnose sevengill shark. for a few years before venturing out. The probable predators of this species are larger sharks. Research from 2002 showed that although juvenile sevengill sharks utilize nursery areas in a similar way, males mature faster than females even if they are the same size and thus males are more likely to leave the nursery area before females. In 2004, John G Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History published a detailed analysis of the broadnose sevengill shark including imagery such as CT scans and morphology of its braincase. A broadnose sevengill shark in the Aquarium of the Bay Conservation and relationship to humans Painting by Frederick Schoenfeld The broadnose sevengill is listed by the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient throughout most of its range, and as possibly Vulnerable in the northeast Pacific and Near Threatened in the eastern Pacific. This species likely suffers great ongoing pressure from various types of fisheries, and from frequently being caught as bycatch. In Argentina, it's fished by rod and reel and broadnose sevengill shark fishing competitions have been occurring since the 1960s. It is also threatened by water pollution and is hunted for its liveroil and hide which is considered good quality in places such as China. In the early 1980s, intense fishing in the San Francisco Bay caused a local decline. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the broadnose sevengill shark as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Its meat and fins are in demand in countries such as the US, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Israel, and is packaged for frozen food. The broadnose sevengill is also a source of vitamin A and utilized by South African sport anglers for winter tournaments, however, this shark is not easy to land despite being readily hooked. It is frequently seen by tourists and in temperate water aquariums and can adapt to captivity. One of the aquariums that houses the broadnose sevengill shark, Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon, has featured it as a \\"keynote species\\". There is also an app Sevengill Shark Tracking \\"Shark Observers\\" that allows divers to log sightings that are added to the Shark Observation Network, where the information supports \\"environmental awareness, assessment and policy making, and public participation at a global level\\". Not many conservation measures are known but it has been recorded from one marine reserve in South Africa and it occurs in La Jolla Cove, La Jolla, San Diego, California with the latter having an apparent population increase in 2013. 2009 research also suggested that Bah√≠a Anegada be made a conservation area given the high number of sharks there. In Washington state, recreational fishing of broadnose sevengill shark is closed on all state waters. In Victoria, Australia, the Department of Environment and Primary Industries sets a one bag limit and must be whole or in carcass form. The International Shark Attack File considers this shark to be potentially dangerous because of its proximity to humans, and because of its aggressive behavior when provoked. It has also been noted as being aggressive towards divers in both public aquariums and the wild and spearfishermen. In 2013, in Fiordland, New Zealand, a sevengill bit a diver's regulator and then his head Human remains were also found in one specimen's stomach therefore divers should be wary of this shark . Seven attacks on humans by the broadnose sevengill have been recorded since the 16th century, with no known fatalities . In 2020 a 13 year old girl was bitten while surfing at Oreti Beach in New Zealand. The girl continued to surf for an hour before realizing her leg was bleeding.

The first western explorers in this region heard reports of an extremely high mountain, and sought it out. An early remote measurement of the mountain, then called Bokunka, was first performed by the expedition of Graf B√©la Sz√©chenyi in 1877‚Äì80.Arnold Heim: The Glaciation and Solifluction of Minya Gongkar. The Geographical Journal. Vol. 87, No. 5 (May, 1936), pp. 444‚Äì450. Published by: The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) That survey put the altitude of the peak at 7600 meter. Forty-five years later the mountain, this time called Gang ka, was sketched by missionary J. H. Edgar, again from a distance. In 1929 the explorer Joseph Rock, making an attempt to measure its altitude, miscalculated its height as and cabled the National Geographic Society to announce Minya Konka as the highest mountain in the world. This measurement was viewed with suspicion from the start, and the Society's decision to check Rock's calculations before publication was well- founded. Following discussions with the Society, Rock reduced the claim to in his formal publication. In 1930 Swiss geographer Eduard Imhof led an expedition that measured altitude of the mountain to be . A richly illustrated large-format book about the expedition was eventually published by Eduard Imhof, Die Gro√üen Kalten Berge von Szetchuan (Orell Fussli Verlag, Zurich, 1974). The book includes many color paintings by Imhof, including images of the monastery at the foot of the sacred mountain. (The Tibetan monastery at the base of the mountain, documented in image by Imhof, was almost completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, around 1972-74.) A properly equipped American team returned to the mountain in 1932, and did an accurate survey of the peak and its environs. Their summit altitude measurement agreed with Imhof's figure of 7,590 m. Two members (Terris Moore, and Richard Burdsall) of this small four person expedition (which included Arthur B. Emmons and Jack T. Young) succeeded in climbing to the summit. They began on the west side of the mountain and climbed the Northwest Ridge. This was a remarkable achievement at the time, considering the height of the mountain, its remoteness, and the small size of the group. In addition, this peak was the highest summit reached by Americans until 1958 (though Americans had by that time climbed to higher non-summit points). The book written by the expedition members, Men Against The CloudsR. Burdsall, T. Moore, A. Emmons, and J. Young, Men Against The Clouds (revised edition), The Mountaineers, 1980. remains a mountaineering classic. In May 1957, a Chinese mountaineering team claimed to climb Minya Konka via the northwest ridge route established by Moore and Burdsall. With limited climbing experience, and primitive equipment, six people reached the summit. Four climbers died in the effort. For political reasons, this region of China was inaccessible to foreign climbers after the 1930s. In 1980 the region was again opened to foreign expeditions. Lance Owens received first permission from the People's Republic of China to lead an American mountaineering expedition in China and Tibet, allowing him to climb Gongga Shan (Minya Konka) in 1980. This expedition opened the modern era of American climbing in China. The expedition, organized by Owens and sponsored by the American Alpine Club, attempted the (still unclimbed and extremely technical) West face of Minya Konka. Members of the expedition included Louis Reichardt, Andrew Harvard, Gary Bocarde, Jed Williamson, and Henry Barber. Minya Konka, photographed from the west. Photograph taken during the 1980 American expedition. Deaths on the Mountain A large number of mountaineering deaths have occurred on Gongga Shan, which has deservedly earned a reputation as a difficult and dangerous mountain. While the first ascent route up the northwest ridge appears technically straight-forward, it is plagued by severe avalanche dangers, increased by the mountain's highly unpredictable weather. During the 1957 Chinese ascent of the peak, four of nine climbers died. In 1980 an American climber died in an avalanche on the northwest ridge route.Rick Ridgeway, Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father, 2000 In an unsuccessful 1981 attempt on the peak, eight Japanese climbers died in a fall.Searchers find body missing for 26 years, AAP, Jun 12 2007 SummitPost Minya Konka (Gongga Shan) As of 1999, more climbers had died trying to climb the mountain than had reached the summit. In 2003, The SummitPost reported the mountain had been successfully climbed only eight times. In total, 22 climbers reached the summit, and 16 climbers died in the effort. (These statistics may not take into account the four Chinese climbers killed in the 1957 expedition.) The Himalayan Index lists five ascents of Gongga Shan between 1982 and 2002, and about seven unsuccessful attempts. There have been several attempts in years since then, which are unlisted in this index. In October 2017, Chinese media reported that Pavel Ko≈ô√≠nek, a Czech national, had reached the top of Gongga Shan, marking the first time in fifteen years ‚Äî since 2002 ‚Äî that the mountain had been successfully climbed. The article summarized the climbing history of Gongga Shan (Minya Konka): \\"Under the long-term action of the glacier, the main peak developed into a cone-shaped, high-angle peak, with surrounding cliffs at 60¬∞ to 70¬∞. Coupled with the bad weather in the region, it is difficult to conquer. The summit is much more difficult than Everest. According to incomplete statistics, as of September 2017, a total of 32 people had successfully reached the summit and 21 people were killed during attempts to climb the peak. According to the Sichuan Mountaineering Association, the death rate of Gongga Shan is much higher than Everest and all the 13 peaks over 8000 meters, making it the peak with the highest mountain death rate in the world....\\" References *Jill Neate, High Asia: An Illustrated History of the 7000 Metre Peaks, Further reading * Michael Brandtner: Minya Konka Schneeberge im Osten Tibets.

He is the second character to assume the role of Robin and the second character to take up the Red Hood alias. First appearing in Batman #357 (March 1983), Todd was created to succeed Dick Grayson, the original Robin, as Batman's vigilante partner. Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentors rigorously. Though initially popular while he was Robin, the character as written by Jim Starlin was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by Max Allan Collins in Batman #408‚Äì409. This negative reception led to DC Comics holding a telephone poll in 1988's \\"A Death in the Family\\" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of the Joker, Batman's nemesis. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent Batman stories dealt with Batman's guilt over not having been able to save him. Todd was resurrected in 2005's \\"Under the Hood\\" story arc and became the new Red Hood, an antihero with a willingness to use lethal force and weapons. Since his return, he operates as the Red Hood in current DC Comics continuity.Countdown The character has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including television series and video games. Jason Todd makes his live-action debut in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans, played by Curran Walters as Robin seasons 1 and 2 and Red Hood in season 3. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Todd as #23 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\". Publication history By the time Len Wein took over as editor of DC Comics' Batman titles in 1982, Dick Grayson had largely moved on to starring as the leader of the young superhero team the Teen Titans in DC's New Teen Titans title. However, with the character no longer featured in Batman comics, the disadvantages of telling Batman stories without the character to act as a sounding board for the protagonist became apparent.Daniels, Les. Batman: The Complete History. Chronicle Books, 1999. , pg. 147 Jason Todd was created as Dick Grayson's replacement as Robin. The character debuted in Batman #357 (March 1983) and made his first full appearance in Detective Comics #525 (April 1983), but it wasn't until later that year when he would appear in costume as Robin in Batman #366 (Dec 1983) when he showed up towards the end of the story to help Batman fight the Joker. Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC took the opportunity to reboot many of its properties. The character was completely revamped. According to Dennis O'Neil, who took over as Batman editor in 1986, \\"[The fans] did hate him. I don't know if it was fan craziness‚Äîmaybe they saw him as usurping Dick Grayson's position. Some of the mail response indicated that this was at least on some people's minds.\\"Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. \\"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil.\\" The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. , pg. 21 =\\"A Death in the Family\\"= Cover of Batman #428 (December 1988) from the storyline A Death in the Family. Art by Mike Mignola. In 1988, Dennis O'Neil suggested that an audience might be attracted to the comics by being offered the opportunity to influence the creative process.Daniels, p. 160 Settling on the idea of telephone poll via a 1-900 number, O'Neil had decided due to discussions with DC Comics president Jenette Kahn that the poll should not be wasted on something insignificant. O'Neil settled on using the poll to determine the fate of the second Robin. O'Neil said, \\"The logical candidate was Jason because we had reason to believe that he wasn't that popular anyway. It was a big enough stunt that we couldn't do it with a minor character.\\"Pearson; Uricchio. \\"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil\\". p. 22 Even though Jason Todd was unpopular with readers, O'Neil could not decide what to do with the character, so he opted to present the choice to the readership. The vote was set up in the four-part story \\"A Death in the Family\\" that was published in Batman #426‚Äì429 in 1988. At the end of Batman #427, Jason was beaten by the Joker and left to die in an explosion. The inside back cover of the issue listed two 1‚Äì900 numbers that readers could call to vote for the character's death or survival. Within the 36-hour period allotted for voting, the poll received 10,614 votes. The verdict in favor of the character's death won by a slim 72-vote margin of 5,343 votes to 5,271.O'Neil, Dennis. \\"Postscript\\". Batman: A Death in the Family. DC Comics, 1988. The following issue, Batman #428, was published featuring Todd's death. Years later, O'Neil said it was possible that hundreds of votes in the \\"Jason Dies\\" line came from a single person, adding a large degree of uncertainty to the honesty of results regarding a poll designed to determine the character's popularity. \\"I heard it was one guy, who programmed his computer to dial the thumbs down number every ninety seconds for eight hours, who made the difference\\", O'Neil said in a Newsarama interview conducted alongside writer Judd Winick during the \\"Under The Hood\\" arc. O'Neil would later repeat the claim with further specifics: \\"I heard it was a lawyer who was using a Macintosh and lived in California‚ÄîI obviously don't have hard information on this, but I heard someone out there programmed his computer to dial it every couple of minutes, and since there was only about 65 votes that made the difference, if that story is true, that guy, that guy killed Jason Todd!\\"Batman: Under the Red Hood Blu-ray featurette, Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd Despite the poll results, O'Neil noted, \\"We did the deed, and we got a blast of hate mail and a blast of negative commentary in the press.\\"Daniels, p. 161 A few comics creators voiced their displeasure at the event. Writer/artist Frank Miller, who had worked on Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One, said, \\"To me the whole killing of Robin thing was probably the ugliest thing I've seen in comics, and the most cynical.\\"Sharrett, Christopher. \\"Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller\\". The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. , p. 41 However, DC stood behind the outcome of the poll. O'Neil was quoted on the back cover of A Death in the Family trade paperback collecting the story with Todd's death as saying, \\"It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.\\"A Death in the Family trade paperback O'Neil would later regret his comment.\\"If I had to do it again, I would certainly have kept my mouth shut.\\"‚ÄîDennis O'Neil, Who Killed Robin? An Interactive Whodunit, from DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes, by Les Daniels There was a degree of discontinuity between the Batman and Detective Comics titles with regards to the portrayal of Jason. A great deal of adventures occurred post-Crisis which fit with the circus acrobat era and in some cases ran simultaneously in Detective as the street kid origin was being laid out in Batman. This led to a blackout of almost any Robin appearances in Detective. This became especially apparent after his death. Eleven months passed between Jason's death in Batman #428 and the first mention of his passing in Detective Comics #606. In 1989, Denny O'Neil, Marv Wolfman and Pat Broderick would introduce Tim Drake as the third Robin. Mindful of the poor reception Jason received from readers, O'Neil arranged for a more nuanced introduction in which Tim first introduced himself to Dick Grayson and impressed the former Robin with his skills and was revealed to share a history with Grayson. Batman himself would slowly grow to accept Tim as his new partner, although the memory of Jason would play a heavy part in how Batman trained Tim in the months building up to his official appearance as Robin.Batman #457 (December 1990) =\\"Hush\\" and reintroduction= Prior to the release of Batman #617 (September 2003), a page of art from the issue by artist Jim Lee circulated the Internet, apparently revealing the mystery villain Hush, who was the focus of Lee and writer Jeph Loeb's \\"Hush\\" storyline, as a resurrected Jason. The following month's Batman #618 (October 2003) revealed that the appearance of Todd was in fact a ruse by the villain Clayface under the direction of the Riddler and Hush. Loeb explained, \\"I always liked Jason, liked the idea that Batman had a Robin who died in the line of duty and how that would motivate anyone to continue their quest. It would also be the most recent, most painful thing he had to endure. That's why Hush played the card‚Äîto get inside Batman's head... But 'Hush' wasn't about Jason‚ÄîJason was a pawn to be moved around the table... If someone else wanted to tell another Jason story or bring him back and we at least opened the door, that's great!\\" In 2005, writer Judd Winick began the Under the Hood storyline that revolved around the mystery of the identity of the new Red Hood. The character's identity was revealed as Jason Todd in Batman #638. Winick explained that after his initial arc on the Batman title, he suggested doing \\"something big\\" to his editors. Specifically, he wanted to bring the character back from the dead. Winick said, \\"I was less interested in the how and the why and the what of Jason Todd returning from the dead than I am about what Jason's return will do to Batman. Now.\\" The explanation for the character's return was revealed in Batman Annual #25 (2006). After a storyline in Nightwing as part of the One Year Later event where Todd took the mantle of Nightwing for himself, the character reappeared in his Red Hood persona as one of the focal characters of DC's year-long weekly Countdown series starting in May 2007. =\\"Battle for the Cowl\\"= Red Hood in Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 (November 2011). Art by Kenneth Rocafort. In the Batman R.I.P. follow-up storyline Batman: Battle for the Cowl (2009), Jason Todd is featured as a gun- wielding vigilante. Commenting on the direction and utilization of Jason Todd in the storyline, writer and artist Tony Daniel has stated that, from this point on, Jason is a \\"bona fide\\" villain: Timothy Drake eventually takes up the bat mantle when Dick Grayson refuses to and sets off to fight Todd, who easily defeats him. Grayson then comes to the rescue and refuses to believe Todd when he claims he has killed Drake, which he has not since current Robin Damian Wayne rescued Drake at the last moment. They battle and Grayson eventually defeats Todd, who says that he will be seen again. =The Outlaws= On June 6, 2011, as part of DC Comics' line-wide revamp initiative, it was announced Jason Todd will headline his own title in the guise of the Red Hood. Todd acts as leader of the Outlaws, a group of antiheroes that \\"have several different exciting characters from the DC Universe ‚Äì some we've seen before and some we haven't,\\" Batman Group Editor Mike Marts said. The group includes Roy Harper and Starfire. Red Hood and the Outlaws debuted in September 2011, written by Scott Lobdell and with art by Kenneth Rocafort. The series has focused on Jason Todd's redemption, and introduced a simplified version of his origin story as the Red Hood in Red Hood and the Outlaws #0, a special prequel issue between #12 and #13. Red Hood and the Outlaws was later rebooted as part of DC's Rebirth event. This series starred a new lineup of Outlaws: Todd, Artemis of Bana-Mighdall and Bizarro, who were touted as a darker counterpart to the Trinity. This lineup lasted for 25 issues, after which Todd briefly reunited with Harper and then went solo. Todd later rescues Bunker and joins forces with a new Wingman to take over Penguin's Iceberg Lounge. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths= The initial version of Jason \\"Jay\\" Todd from before Crisis on Infinite Earths had an origin that was similar to the 1940 origin of the original Robin (Dick Grayson). Originally, he is the son of circus acrobats (Joseph Todd and Trina Todd, killed by a criminal named Killer Croc) and is later adopted by Bruce Wayne.Batman #357‚Äì358, Detective Comics Vol. 1 #526 Distinguished by strawberry blond hair, Todd is wearing various pieces of Dick Grayson's old childhood disguises as costume to fight crime until Grayson presents him with a Robin costume of his own. At that point, Todd dyes his hair black, and in later stories blossoms under Batman's tutelage. For a time Natalia Knight, the criminal also known as Nocturna, Mistress of the Night is a stabilizing influence in his life; she becomes his surrogate mother and even adopts the young Todd. Catwoman would be a frequent guest star during this era as she wrestled with the role of hero and as a love interest for Batman which led to clashes with the boy feeling left out. In the Alan Moore epic Superman Annual #11, \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", Batman and Todd join Wonder Woman at the Fortress of Solitude to celebrate Superman's birthday. They arrive only to find Superman incapacitated by a mysterious creature and Mongul there to battle the heroes. Todd as Robin saves Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman from Mongul by unleashing Mongul's own hallucination-causing creature on the tyrant himself. Todd also tackled the drug problem in his school, hauling in the local dealers who were muscled up with Two-Face. One of the more memorable moments of this era occurred in Detective Comics #569 when Batman forbade Jason from using \\"Holy!\\" puns. =Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths= Origin Following the revamp due to Crisis on Infinite Earths, Jason Todd is recast as a young street orphan who first encounters Batman while attempting to steal the tires off the Batmobile in Crime Alley, the very place where Batman's parents were murdered years before. The son of Willis Todd and Catherine Todd, Jason lives on the East end of Gotham City in the Park Row district called Crime Alley. Catherine was a drug addict who died of an overdose some time before he began living on the street. Willis, a former medical student, was working as hired muscle for Two-Face and had disappeared suspiciously following a botched assignment. Bruce Wayne sees to it that Todd is placed in a school for troubled youths, which turns out to be Ma Gunn's School for Crime. Jason earns the Robin mantle a short while later by helping Batman apprehend the gang of thieves. However, Todd does not wear the Robin costume until six months of training.Batman (vol. 1) #410 (August 1987) Batman notes that while Todd doesn't possess Dick Grayson's natural athleticism and acrobatic skills, he can become a productive crimefighter by channeling his rage. He also believes that if he doesn't help the boy, Todd will eventually become part of the \\"criminal element\\". In the revamp period, Todd is portrayed as the \\"rebel\\" Robin. He smokes, swears, and fights authority. He is prone to defying Batman's orders, sometimes to success (bringing in the Scarecrow singlehandedly) and sometimes failure (botching a raid on a drug lab by jumping the gun too soon). Todd also aided Batman while Gotham City was temporarily overrun by Deacon Blackfire as shown in Batman: The Cult. The most controversial moment prior to his death occurred in Batman #424 when serial rapist Felipe Garzonas escapes prosecution due to his father's diplomatic immunity. One of his victims, a girl named Gloria, hangs herself amid the threat of a third rape from Felipe. Todd discovers her hanging and makes a beeline for Felipe, ahead of Batman, who arrived just in time to see Felipe take a 22-story fall to his death, with Todd as Robin at the edge of the balcony. Todd maintains \\"I guess I spooked him. He slipped.\\" This highlights an earlier exchange in Batman #422 where he uses excessive force on a pimp about to slash one of his working girls and Todd asks Batman if it would have been big loss if he had killed him. It is left ambiguous whether Todd killed him. In Batman #425, the Dynamic Duo is challenged by Felipe's father, who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon in retaliation for his son's death. Batman is instructed to meet the kidnappers at a city junkyard and to bring Robin. Batman does not wish to involve Todd and keeps this information from him. However, Robin senses something is wrong and hides in the Batmobile's trunk as Batman heads to the junkyard. There, Batman is unable to reach Gordon, surrounded by Garzonas' men, and Todd intervenes, saving Batman from a close call. Machine gun fire breaks out and Gordon is wounded in the arm. All of the henchmen die, and Garzonas is finally crushed by a pile of junk cars. Death Batman carries Jason Todd's body in Batman #428 (1988): \\"A Death in the Family\\". Art by Jim Aparo In 1988's \\"A Death in the Family\\" storyline, Jason Todd discovers that Catherine Todd was not his biological mother, and runs away to find the woman who gave birth to him. After following a number of leads, including an Israeli Mossad agent and Shiva Woo-San, Todd finally tracks his biological mother Sheila Haywood to Ethiopia, where she works as an aid worker. While Todd is overjoyed to be reunited with his real mother, he soon discovers that she is being blackmailed by the Joker using her to provide him with medical supplies. Sheila herself has been embezzling from the aid agency and as part of the cover-up, she hands her own son, having arrived as Robin, over to Joker. Joker beats the boy brutally with a crowbar, and then leaves him and Sheila in the warehouse with a time bomb. Sheila and Jason try desperately to get out of the warehouse but are still inside as the bomb goes off. Batman arrives too late to save them, and finds Jason's lifeless body in the rubble. Sheila lives just long enough to tell Batman that Jason died trying to protect her. The bodies are taken back to Gotham City for burial. Todd's death haunts Batman ever since, as he considers it his greatest failure. He keeps the second Robin's uniform on display in the Batcave as a reminder. The Joker, on the other hand, would occasionally remind Batman over this loss to torment him. Batman as a result, initially became a reckless and more violent vigilante in his grief, got darker in character without compromising his morals and ethics. He also struggles with his temptation to kill the Joker since. Return from the grave Years later, while trying to discover the identity of a mysterious figure plotting against him, Batman discovers that Tim Drake, Jason's successor as Robin, has been kidnapped. He confronts the kidnapper, and is stunned to discover that he is apparently an adult Todd, standing at his own desecrated grave site, and wearing a redesigned and darker version of his Robin costume. Batman subdues this mystery \\"Jason\\" and discovers that it is only Clayface impersonating Todd, concluding that \\"Jason's\\" greater physical age was to hide the flaws in Clayface's impersonation by allowing him to partially mimic Nightwing's combat skills. However, Todd's actual body is missing from its grave.Loeb, Jeph (w), Lee, Jim (p), Williams, Scott (i). Batman: Hush #10‚Äì11 (2001). DC Comics. It is later revealed that Todd had indeed died at the hands of the Joker. However, when Superboy-Prime alters reality from the paradise dimension in which he is trapped‚Äîhis punches against the barrier keeping him from the rest of the universe causing temporal ripples‚ÄîJason Todd is restored to life, breaks out of his coffin, and is eventually hospitalized; because he wandered so far from his grave before his discovery, no connection was ever drawn between the two events. Todd never turns up on any missing persons reports‚Äîas he was never 'missing'‚Äînor can he be identified since no prints are on file for him. After spending a year in a coma and subsequently another year as an amnesiac vagrant, he is taken by Talia al Ghul after a small-time crook recognizes him as Robin due to his combat skills on the street. Talia took Todd in out of her love for Batman, while her father Ra's al Ghul was interested in the secret behind his resurrection. The League of Assassins tracked and eliminated everyone in Gotham who knew of Todd's resurrection to prevent Batman from finding out. They also interrogated Joker's henchmen who were with him during Todd's murder, in hopes to find out how the boy could have survived.Red Hood: The Lost Days #1 (August 2010) Talia later restored Todd's health and memory by immersing him in a Lazarus Pit in which her father was also bathing and helped him escape the House of al Ghul. It is suggested by Ra's that the power of the pit resulted in Todd's mental instability. Ra's refers to Todd as a \\"curse\\" and a \\"pestilence\\" unleashed on the planet, saying that madness may affect him for \\"hours, months, or decades\\". Using the money from Talia and infuriated by her statement that he \\"remains unavenged\\", Todd paid a group of mercenaries to help him return to Gotham. Upon arriving, he enacts a plan to get revenge on Batman, whom he resents for refusing to kill the Joker and thus avenge his death. The Lost Days Jason Todd creates a false arms trafficking of advanced military arsenal, knowing that Batman would respond. This provides Jason an opportunity to plant a bomb beneath the Batmobile while Batman is on a stakeout for the arms deal. Batman enters the car and is at Jason's mercy, detonator in hand. However, Todd realizes that if he went through with it, his former mentor would never know about his return nor the identity of his killer. Todd instead decides to kill Batman directly by traveling across the globe in search of a similar, but deadlier type of training to Bruce Wayne's own in order to prepare for that day.Red Hood: The Lost Days #2 (September 2010) For years, Todd learns various skills from various masters, assassins, mercenaries, and aviators around the globe, including guns, poisons and antitoxins, martial arts, acrobatics, and bomb- making. Upon learning that the man training him in lethal combat is also the leader of a child sex slave ring, Jason frees the latest shipment of children and takes them to a local embassy, then returns to the training compound and poisons his new mentor for his crimes. Upon being questioned by Talia al Ghul, Todd says it was not murder but rather that he \\"put down a reptile\\".Red Hood: The Lost Days #3 (October 2010) Jason has since repeated the same pattern of killing his teachers when finding them guilty after he has finished with his training. During his journey, Jason discovers his Robin replacement was Timothy \\"Tim\\" Drake, which further torments him. He also learns that the man teaching him bomb-making is involved in a Russian mafia-backed deal meant to push the resources of British law enforcement away from mob crime and onto Islamic extremist terrorism with a framed bombing plot. Todd manages to hunt down the gang and safely detonate the bombs. Ironically, the only surviving member of the gang offers Jason the possibility of a large government payday in exchange for his life, because he knows where a very wanted man is. That wanted man turns out to be the Joker.Red Hood: The Lost Days #4 (November 2010)Red Hood: The Lost Days #5 (December 2010) After learning of the Joker's arms deal in Los Angeles for another terrorism scheme against Gotham, Jason begins to stalk the villain as a masked assassin. After successfully capturing Joker (who fails to recognize him), Jason contemplates burning his killer alive after dousing with gasoline. However, Jason realizes that he does not simply want Joker to die, but desires to punish the villain with Batman. Jason spares Joker and decides to wait for the right opportunity.Red Hood: The Lost Days #6 (January 2011) Jason also admits to Talia that he has already deduced that the reason she finances his training is to stall him from killing Batman, but he has no desire to kill his former mentor anymore. Talia then gives Todd the idea to be the Batman that Gotham needs. She also hires the same carpenters who built Jason's casket and had them build a replica of it (the original was destroyed and beyond repair after Jason emerged from it). Todd enters into a pact with Hush and the Riddler. He confirms to Hush that Riddler is correct that Bruce Wayne is Batman. As Hush, Riddler and Jason collaborate, Jason initially confronts Batman at his own gravesite. Jason then switches places with Clayface in order to observe Batman from afar. When Batman expresses no remorse for sparing Joker's life after the second Robin was killed, Todd is further angered and takes up his murderer's original mantle. After she initiated a takeover of Kord Industries for him, Talia gifts Jason the flame dagger (a replica of the one Ra's al Ghul often carried) and the red helmet which become his signature weapon and mask. Red Hood Jason Todd as Red Hood in Batman #638. Art by Doug Mahnke Shortly after the events of \\"War Games\\" and just before \\"War Crimes\\", Jason Todd reappears in Gotham City as the Red Hood.Batman (vol. 1) #635 (February 2005) He hijacks a shipment of Kryptonite from Black Mask, and in the midst of a battle with Batman, Nightwing and Mr. Freeze, Red Hood gives them the Kryptonite back, and tells them he has gotten what he truly wanted: a \\"lay of the land\\". Shortly afterward, Red Hood finds the Joker (driven out of Gotham by Hush) and beats him with a crowbar just as Joker had beaten Jason. Despite the violence of the beating, Jason spares Joker, intending to use him later against Batman. Red Hood assumes control over several gangs in Gotham City and starts a one-man war against Black Mask's criminal empire. Overall, he strives to take over Gotham's gangs, control their activities, and to kill Joker in revenge for his own death. In his new role as Gotham's most powerful crime lord, he repeatedly comes to blows with Batman and several of his allies. A Robin mask is found in the Batmobile, which never belonged to Dick or Tim, but is of the style that Todd wore as Robin, suggesting that he'd been stalking Batman.Batman (vol. 1) #630 (July 2004) After their encounter in the cemetery, Batman becomes obsessed with the possibility of resurrection from the dead, secretly aware that it was really Jason he fought, and seeks advice from allies such as Superman and Green Arrow, both of whom have died and returned to life. Around this time, Batman discovers that the empty coffin buried at Jason's gravesite is a replica of what he bought. Nevertheless, Batman keeps Jason's Robin costume in its memorial display case in the Batcave; when Alfred Pennyworth asks if he wants the costume removed, Batman sadly replies that the return of Todd \\"doesn't change anything at all\\".Batman (vol. 1) #641 (June 2005) Acting on his obsession with Tim Drake, Todd breaks into Titans Tower to confront the third Robin, thus revealing the truth of their encounter at the cemetery to his successor. Having learned that Tim occasionally defeat the Joker by himself, Jason seeks to best him in combat. Wearing another version of his Robin costume, Todd quickly immobilizes the other Teen Titans and strikes Drake down in the Tower's Hall of Fallen Titans. Furious that no memorial statue was made for him (despite his short tenure as a Titan), he demands that Drake tell him if he is really as good as Todd has been told. Drake says \\"Yes\\" and passes out. As he leaves, he tears the 'R' emblem from Drake's chest, though he later admits that Drake has talent. Todd is also left wondering if perhaps he would have been a better Robin and better person had he have had a life like Drake's and friends like the Titans.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #29 (December 2005) Todd eventually kidnaps and holds Joker hostage, luring Batman to Crime Alley, the site of their first meeting. Despite their now- antagonistic relationship, Batman desperately wants to help Todd, and intends to atone for his own failures. Todd asks Batman why he has not avenged his death by killing Joker, a psychopath who has murdered countless people and crippled one of their best friends, arguing that Batman should have done it \\"because he took me away from you\\". Batman admits that he has often fantasized about taking the Joker somewhere private to torture for weeks before finally killing the maniac, but says that he refuses to go to that place. Todd then offers Batman an ultimatum: he will kill Joker unless Batman kills Todd first. Holding Joker at gunpoint, he throws a pistol to Batman and begins to count to three while standing behind Joker, leaving Batman with only a headshot if he wants to stop Todd pulling the trigger. At the last moment, Batman throws a batarang at Todd, which bounces off a pipe and sinks into his neck causing him to drop his gun. Joker takes advantage of the situation, detonating nearby explosives that engulf the platform and send them plunging into the bay.Batman: Under the Hood (Batman #635‚Äì641, 645‚Äì650) Nightwing Jason Todd resurfaces following the \\"One Year Later\\" period, patrolling the streets of New York City as a murderous version of Nightwing. However, Jason shows no intention of giving up the Nightwing persona when confronted by Dick Grayson, and continues to taunt his predecessor by wearing the costume and suggesting that the two become a crime-fighting team. Not long after the two Nightwings meet up, Todd is captured and imprisoned by local mobsters Barry and Buddy Pierce. Grayson reluctantly rescues him, and the two join forces to defeat the Pierce Brothers. Shortly afterward, Todd leaves New York City and the Nightwing mantle to Grayson, along with a telegram telling Grayson he has returned to normal and still considers himself a gift from Batman.Nightwing #118‚Äì122 (2006) Red Hood again Jason Todd resumes his persona as the Red Hood and appears in several issues of \\"Green Arrow\\" alongside Brick as part of a gun-running organization, which brings Batman to Star City. Jason's true motives are shown in the third part as he kidnaps Mia Dearden in an effort to dissolve her partnership with Green Arrow, feeling that they are kindred spirits, cast down by society and at odds with their mentors. The two fight while Todd discusses the insanity of heroes for placing child sidekicks in danger. Mia is deeply troubled by the discussion, but ultimately decides to remain with Green Arrow. At the start of Countdown, Todd rescues a woman from Duela Dent.Countdown #51 (May 2007) After a Monitor shoots and kills Duela, he attempts to kill Jason, but is stopped by a second Monitor. This second Monitor apologizes to Jason before they both disappear, leaving Jason alone with Duela's body. Later, at Duela's funeral, Jason hides until all of the Teen Titans have left except Donna Troy. Jason tells her what happened the night of Duela's death, and about the dueling Monitors. He knows that both he and Donna Troy have come back from the dead, even already deducing that his resurrection has something do with Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s plans during Infinite Crisis, and wonders which of them is next on the Monitor's hit list. The two are then attacked by the Forerunner, but before she can kill them, the apologetic Monitor stops her, and recruits Jason and Donna for a mission to the Palmerverse, a section of the Nanoverse discovered by Ray Palmer, in an attempt to find Palmer. During the trip, Jason takes it upon himself to name the Monitor \\"Bob\\". Jason seems to have a romantic interest in Donna, and is shown to be visibly disgruntled when her old boyfriend Kyle Rayner joins their group as they take their tour to the 52 Earths which comprise the Multiverse. Red Robin Red Robin. Art by Phil Jimenez A teaser image released to promote Countdown showed a figure resembling Red Robin among assembled heroes in poses symbolic of their roles in the series. After a series of contradictory statements about this figure, executive editor Dan DiDio firmly stated in the July 2007 DC Nation column that the figure is Jason Todd. The Red Robin costume, originally designed by Alex Ross for the 1996 Kingdom Come limited series and worn by the Earth-22 Dick Grayson, is seen in Countdown to Final Crisis #16 in the Earth-51 Batman's base of operations; it is revealed that Earth-51 became the peaceful world it is because the Batman of this Earth killed all the supervillains after his Jason was killed by the Joker. In issue #14, Jason dons the Red Robin suit‚Äîdescribed by Earth-51's Batman as something he was going to give Todd's counterpart when he was older‚Äîand goes into battle alongside Earth-51 Batman. During a battle with a group of Monarch's soldiers, Earth-51 Batman is killed by the Ultraman of Earth-3, deeply affecting Jason. In his grief, Todd kills an alternate version of the Joker, also involved in Batman's killing, who then mocks his loss, vacating alongside Donna, Ray and Kyle to the planet Apokolips before Earth-51's destruction. After the group is sent back to Earth, Todd leaves the group and returns to his crimefighting ways. When the Morticoccus virus is released from Karate Kid's body, he is forcibly brought back to the group by Kyle, much to his dismay. When the Challengers return to New Earth, Todd disposes of his Red Robin costume and abandons the rest of the group, though they go on to declare to the Monitors that they are now the monitors of the Monitors. Todd and Drake are confronted by another Red Robin in Robin #177, whose identity is initially a mystery but later turns out to be Ulysses Armstrong. Due to a combination of Red Robin's involvement and a gun-toting gang member, Todd was shot in the leg and arrested by police. Upon the resolution of the gang war in Gotham, Drake under a pseudonym visited Todd in prison to give him the Justice League access code to release himself from prison. Todd is booked under a pseudonym (John Doe), due to there being no identifiable prints on file for any member of the main bat heroes as well as Jason is still legally dead.Robin (vol. 4) #182 (March 2009) Following his escape, Todd continues on the mend, and is summoned by Tim Drake to come to the Batcave, where Batman has left a Last Will and Testament statement for him. After hearing the statement in private, Todd prepares to leave, not revealing what he was told, although he does pause before his old costume and the tattered remains of Batman's, he is clearly sad.Robin (vol. 4) #183 (April 2009) Batman Jason Todd reappeared in the \\"Battle for the Cowl\\" series. Dressed in a version of a Batman costume, Todd is also living/operating out of an abandoned Gotham subway system. His inner monologue reveals that he had always wanted to eventually replace Batman, and thinks it was a bad idea for Batman to become a public figure, rather than an urban legend. After stabbing Tim Drake in the chest with a batarang, he and Dick Grayson battle down in the subway.Battle for the Cowl #2 (April 2009) Nightwing still wants to save Todd, but Todd refuses the offer, and instead allows himself to fall off a speeding subway into the Gotham River, while stating they would see each other again soon. This allowed Grayson to officially take up the mantle of Batman.Battle for the Cowl #3 (May 2009) It is later revealed in Battle for the Cowl that Bruce Wayne's last words to Jason were of regret at how he had obviously overlooked the young man's deep emotional problems. He thought he could do what could never be done for him and 'make him whole'. His message goes on to plead that Todd get psychiatric help, a notion that the latter rejects. It is suggested by Dick Grayson that Todd was infuriated by Wayne's last words, a reaction that led him to becoming monstrous, murdering Batman in that same arc. Plus, it aggravated his hatred towards the Bat-family, as he repeatedly attempts to kill members of it. Red Hood and Scarlet In the second story arc of Batman and Robin by Grant Morrison and Philip Tan, Jason Todd retakes the Red Hood mantle after losing his bid to become the new Batman. With the goal of making the very concept of Batman obsolete, he puts a lot of effort into public relations: he drastically alters his Red Hood costume to look more like a traditional superhero outfit and recruits his own sidekick Scarlet.( He also is balding). In their war on crime, Red Hood and Scarlet freely kill criminals, villains, and anyone who gets in their way, even the police. He leaves behind a calling card which states \\"let the punishment fit the crime\\". He describes his vendetta against Grayson as \\"the revenge of one crazy man in a mask on another crazy man in a mask\\".Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #3 (October 2009)Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #4 (November 2009) Todd has reappeared with red hair, claiming that he is a natural red-head and that Bruce Wayne had him dye his hair black in order to look like Dick Grayson (as in his pre-Crisis origins). He also claims the white streak of hair that he got is from being resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, though the white streak disappears again.Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #5 (December 2009) In the issue, Todd is characterized as increasingly unstable and his idea of \\"finishing off\\" Batman and Robin now consists of stripping them down to their underwear and exposing their identities via webcam activated by a phone poll [a nod by Morrison to his own death poll]. A fight between Batman, Robin, and the Flamingo ‚Äì a foreign hitman hired by a Mexican cartel after Red Hood killed their operative in Gotham ‚Äì ends with Jason burying Flamingo in debris with a bulldozer. Flamingo is assumed dead, although Commissioner Gordon reports that his body cannot be recovered from beneath the rubble. Grayson offers to rehabilitate Todd who, in a moment of clarity, tells Grayson it is too late for him, and how he tried to be what Batman wanted, \\"but this world... this dirty, twisted, cruel and ugly dungheap had... other plans for me\\". He then proceeds to fall back into his hero persona, ranting how he did what Batman never did. He \\"defeated his archenemy\\". Todd is arrested by Gordon who informs him that the reason he has always worked with Batman is that Batman never violates the law \\"where it counts\\". As Gordon leads him away, Todd tauntingly asks Grayson why he has not put Wayne's corpse into a Lazarus Pit to bring him back, citing his own resurrection from its bath. Scarlet flees Gotham, her mask finally falling from her face as she exits the city limits.Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #6 (January 2010) Jason files an appeal to be moved from Arkham Asylum where he has been held for observation for the last several months. Bruce Wayne as Batman visits him there to inform Jason he's in Arkham for his own protection. Jason points out he's passed all the psychological tests repeatedly and there is no reason to keep him in what he calls Batman's \\"kennel of freaks\\". It is also revealed that, like Tim, Jason was also aware that Batman survived his encounter with Darkseid. Jason is transferred to a Gotham prison and upon his arrival, the suicide rate spikes amongst top incarcerated crime figures there. Several homicides occur due to many botched attempts on Jason's life by inmates with a grudge against Red Hood's tactics. Jason escalates things further by poisoning the cafeteria, killing 82 and sickening 100 more inmates. He is immediately transferred back to Arkham but is broken out of the paddy wagon by a group of mercenaries.Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #23 (July 2011) The mercs reveal they are under orders to bring Jason to the person that hired them and that he is in no danger. Jason breaks free and fights them off all the same as Batman and Robin arrive. Once the hired guns are subdued they reveal their employer has captured Scarlet, Jason's former sidekick. Dick, Damian, and Jason go to one of the Red Hood's weapon caches where he assembles a composite costume made from his biker and \\"superhero\\" Red Hood attire. The three intend to rescue Scarlet.Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #24 (August 2011) After Batman and Robin defeat the mercs, Red Hood rescues Scarlet and escapes using the helicopter. Batman and Robin attempt to chase him, but Red Hood tells them that he planted bombs over Gotham City months ago. Scarlet desires to stay with Red Hood as his partner. Red Hood and Scarlet head towards an unknown destination.Batman and Robin (vol. 1) #25 (September 2011) =The New 52= Origin In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Jason's new origin is revealed in a special Red Hood and the Outlaws #0 (November 2012) issue, which changes the manner in which Batman first met Todd (stealing medicine from Leslie Thompkins, after she had treated him from a brutal beating). The back-up introduces a massive retcon in which the Joker is responsible for orchestrating the major moments of Todd's life such as his father's imprisonment and death, his mother's overdose, his introduction to Thompkins and his adoption of the Robin identity. Considering the Joker is the one narrating this segment, it is open to debate whether he is telling the truth or not. Though only lightly touched on, his resurrection is also simplified: he is resurrected after he is placed into the Lazarus Pit by Talia al Ghul.Red Hood and the Outlaws #0 The Outlaws Robin in Red Hood and the Outlaws #0 (November 2012). Art by Brett Booth Following the events of the \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline, the DC universe was relaunched, with Red Hood becoming the leader of the Outlaws in their own series, part of the New 52 line of comics. The team also includes Starfire and Roy Harper. Instead of being trained by various men after his return from the dead, Jason Todd was trained by an order of warriors known as the All Caste.Red Hood and the Outlaws #3(January 2012) He was a part of the order for an unknown amount of time before he was exiled, partly of his own will.Red Hood and the Outlaws #2 (December 2011) After his exile, he became Red Hood and came to be odds with Dick Grayson, Starfire's ex-lover and his Robin predecessor. He soon tires of Gotham and leaves, gathering the group together; after breaking out Roy from a Middle Eastern prison, he brings Roy up to speed on things. The two start on very friendly terms. Roy and Starfire are in a sexual relationship. However, Starfire makes it clear to Roy that it is only physical, with no emotional ties. Essence, a fellow exiled member of the All Caste whom Jason knows, appears to him, but is invisible to others. She sets Jason on a mission to hunt down a group known as \\"The Untitled\\", telling him of people missing organs before death without any sign of removal, which is their calling card. To top it off, Essence shows that the order of the All Caste, the people most qualified to handle the situation, have been slaughtered, leaving her and Jason as the only known survivors.Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 (November 2011) After finding out he's no longer the killer he once was, Jason brings his group to the All Caste headquarters, the Hundred Acres of All, where they discover the bodies are returning to life as zombies. Jason is forced to destroy the bodies of his teachers and friends. Afterwards, he pays his respects, swearing vengeance for them. He is led on a wild goose chase across the globe. Eventually, he comes across an Untitled, who was in hiding, who tells him that they were set up, but still fights him. Jason kills the creature, strengthening his resolve.Red Hood and the Outlaws #5 (March 2012) Todd has also been revealed to be a member of Batman, Incorporated, initially operating under the name of Wingman, an agent based in Europe. Wingman temporary allies himself with Damian Wayne, who is using the name \\"Redbird\\" at the time. Batman, Inc is at war with an organisation named Leviathan, headed by Talia al Ghul, Damian's mother and the woman responsible for reviving Jason, but in the present she seeks to destroy Batman and has put a bounty on their son's head. Alfred Pennyworth refers to Jason as wanting \\"to be redeemed\\" through his membership.Batman Inc #7 Later, however, the Wingman ruse is exposed and Todd returns to being Red Hood. While he recalls his days as Wingman as a failure, Bruce Wayne is nevertheless proud of him. Following the events of Death of the Family, Bruce and Alfred care for a sick Jason in the Manor, culminating in a warm embrace between Jason and his father figure as he regains consciousness, suggesting that their animosity might finally be put to rest.Red Hood and the Outlaws #18 (2013) After Jason recovers and in the wake of Damian's death, Batman partners with Jason for the first time since Jason's days as Robin. Batman brings Jason on a mission in Ethiopia to punish some of Damian's other would-be assassins, and while there he also takes him to the place of his death in the hopes Jason can provide insights into his resurrection so that he might apply the method to Damian. Jason is hurt by Batman's manipulation, and the two share harsh words and exchange blows, shattering their newfound relationship.Batman and Red Hood #20 Later however, the pair come together, united by the ties of family. Jason teams up with Batman, Batgirl, Cyborg and Red Robin to rescue Damian's body from Apokolips. They are successful, and Damian is resurrected, sharing a warm reunion with Jason and the family.Robin Rises: Alpha #1 Following the traumas of Death of the Family, Damian's death, and his betrayal by Batman, Jason returns to the All-Caste and has his memories wiped so that he may be at peace. He is 'rescued' by Starfire and Arsenal, but does not regain his memories.Red Hood and the Outlaws #20 He subsequently learns of his history from Starfire's computer, which states Red Hood has made 83 confirmed kills. Jason refuses to believe from Starfire and Arsenal that he had been on a path towards redemption, and abandons his teammates.Red Hood and the Outlaws Annual #1 Red Hood/Arsenal Jason Todd as Red Hood on the cover of Red Hood and the Outlaws vol. 2, #1 (October 2016). Art by Giuseppe Camuncoli Following the conclusion of the first volume of Red Hood and the Outlaws, a new series starring Red Hood teaming up with Arsenal as heroes for hire began entitled Red Hood/Arsenal. The series eventually ended coinciding with the DC Rebirth event. =DC Comics Rebirth= Red Hood and the Outlaws The DC Rebirth introduced the revival of Red Hood and the Outlaws with a second volume released in August 2016. Jason Todd's backstory is altered to resemble his original meeting with Batman occurring while trying to steal tires from the Batmobile. Jason's mother is already dead by now and his father is serving a life sentence in prison, so he has been living on the streets. Batman at first tries helping him by enrolling him in Ma Gunn's boarding school, trying to give him a home. However he does not realise that Ma Gunn is actually using the school as a cover to recruit young delinquents into her own criminal gang. When Batman discovers this, he takes down Ma Gunn, with help from Jason. Batman then takes him in and raises him as the new Robin, though realizes early on that Jason has a violent streak. After Jason is killed by the Joker and resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, he goes on to become the Red Hood, straining his relationship with Batman. The new team consists of Jason Todd as Red Hood, the disgraced Amazon warrior named Artemis, and the Superman clone called Bizarro. This team is referred to as DC's \\"Dark Trinity\\" in comparison to the new Trinity series included in DC Rebirth which follows Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The team would stay together until Red Hood and the Outlaws #25-26, where Jason went solo after his team disappeared and the title was changed to Red Hood: Outlaw. He also later appears in Year of the Villain and Event Leviathan #2. Abilities and equipment =Skills and abilities= To become Robin, Jason Todd was trained by Bruce Wayne, just as Dick Grayson was, rigorously training him in acrobatics, detective work, strategy, and martial arts. After his resurrection, he expands on his training by learning from people of the same caliber as those who trained his ex-mentor Batman, becoming highly skilled in the aforementioned fields by the time he reaches adulthood. Jason's fighting style emphasizes brutality, speed, and strength, incorporating Aikido, Capoeira, Karate, Kickboxing, Krav Maga, Ninjutsu, Savate, Silat, and Taekwondo. With an extensive knowledge of Batman's tactics, Jason can anticipate most of his former mentor's actions and counter them. Through Talia al Ghul's access to Kord Industries,Batman Annual (vol. 1) #1 (Summer 1961) as well as being LexCorp's former CEO,Rucka, Greg (w), Eaglesham, Dale (p), Kryssing, Ray (i), Comicraft (let), Mike Carlin (ed). \\"Most Suitable Person\\" President Luthor Secret Files and Origins (March, 2001), New York: DC Comics Jason has access to high-level civilian and military-grade weaponry including firearms such as pistols, machine guns, shotguns, etc. He also has access to explosives, rocket launchers, and advanced computer equipment and gadgetry. However, his dagger (which resembles a kris and is a replica of one of Ra's al Ghul's knives) still remains as his preferred weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat; it can cut through Batman's armor and arsenal. He also has some lethally sharpened shurikens based on Batman's batarang designs as throwing weapons. =Firearms= Having been trained by Batman, Jason Todd has perfect aim when using batarangs and later, firearms. To increase his skill with firearms, he went a step further than Batman on his journey around the world to learn from masters how to kill a target with different types of guns. His weapons of choice are a pair of customized IWI Jericho 941s, fitted with extra picatinny rails and mini red- dot sights. Alternative versions =The Dark Knight Returns= Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, which was published before \\"A Death in the Family\\", references Jason Todd. Jason Todd is implied to have died in the line of duty, although the exact details are not given. It is implied that Todd's death was a contributing factor to Batman's retirement. When Batman allows Carrie Kelley to assume the mantle of Robin, Alfred Pennyworth objects, citing Todd as a reason. Batman responds by stating \\"I will never forget Jason. He was a good soldier. He honored me. But the war goes on.\\" The details of Jason's death is revealed in the comic book one-shot Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade, by the first series' author Frank Miller with Brian Azzarello, and art by John Romita, Jr. Romita reveals that the Joker, like in the \\"A Death in the Family\\" story arc, plays an important role in Jason Todd's demise in Miller's Dark Knight Universe. It was released on June 15, 2016. After Jason defeats and captures the Joker; the villain becomes fixated on him. After the Joker again escapes from Arkham Asylum, Jason tracks his whereabouts on his own, and is brutally beaten to death by the Joker's men under his order. =Earth-Two concept= In an interview for the Infinite Crisis hardcover, Jeanine Schaefer states that Geoff Johns had planned to reveal the second Red Hood as the Jason Todd of the Earth-Two universe. Said Schaefer: =Batman: The Brave and the Bold= In an issue of The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Phantom Stranger summons all of the Robins, including Jason, Tim Drake, Carrie Kelley, Damian Wayne, Nightwing, and Stephanie Brown, to save Batman. At first, Jason refuses to take orders from Nightwing or work with the other Robins, but Damian threatens him by telling him that he knows his fate and can make it happen sooner than expected, referencing his death in the comics. Nightwing notes that Jason fights aggressively, like he's angry at the world and doesn't hold back. =Flashpoint= An alternate version of Jason appears in the Flashpoint timeline, where, among other changes, Bruce Wayne was killed as a child and thus never became Batman. Here Jason is portrayed as a former drug- addict and follower of Brother Blood who eventually turned his life around and became a priest. He still died, but was eventually resurrected and recovered from it physically and mentally.Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint #2 (July 2011) =A World Without Young Justice= In this alternate timeline, there appeared a version of Jason. He is a black-haired circus kid with criminal acrobats as parents (Willis and Catherine Todd) who worked for Killer Croc. He is killed during this story line by his ex-girlfriend (an alternate version of Empress) on behalf of his stepmother Catherine.Young Justice #44 =Amalgam= In the Amalgam Universe, Jason Todd was a young S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit with a bright future, who was personally mentored by Director Logan Wayne and Moonwing. Despite his reckless nature, Dick chose Jason as his successor when he temporarily left S.H.I.E.L.D. to attend college. As Moonwing, he made a careless mistake, which resulted in a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's death, causing him to be dismissed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Jason became furious and blamed his mentors. He was then caught in an explosion when the villain Hyena detonated a bomb intended to kill Logan and Dark Claw. Despite his body never being recovered, S.H.I.E.L.D. presumed he was dead, but he survived and his body was recovered by HYDRA, who replaced his damaged body parts with robotic parts, transforming him into Deathlok. He then participated in a coup to help Madame Cat overthrow the Supreme Leader of Hydra, Lex Luthor a.k.a. Green Skull. Afterwards, he swore allegiance to her. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents launched an attack on HYDRA's base, Deathlok was sent to confront them, where he spotted his former mentor, Moonwing and attacked him from behind. He then revealed that he's been waiting a long time to kill both Dick and Logan. He then unmasked Moonwing and accused him and Logan of abandoning him. He then began strangling Dick, but before he could kill him Colonel Nick Fury and Sergeant Joe Rock commandeered an aircraft and shot Deathlok several times in the back. Despite feeling sorry for Jason, Dick left Jason to die again so he could continue the attack on the HYDRA base.Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1 This is noteworthy as this version of the character was introduced nine years before the canon Jason was resurrected as Red Hood. =Batman: Arkham Knight= Jason Todd, as the Arkham Knight, is featured in the tie-in comics to the Batman: Arkham video game series. This version's backstory is similar to the comics, as he was originally a young thief living on the streets, until being adopted by Batman after he was caught attempting to steal the Batmobile's tires. He subsequently became the second Robin, but was ultimately captured and tortured by the Joker in an abandoned wing of Arkham Asylum, where he was left for months. The Joker filmed himself. During the events of the series' first installment, Jason convinced Deathstroke, who was hired by the Joker to kill Jason if he tried to escape, to help him by promising him a bigger payment. After escaping from Arkham, Jason hacks into one of Bruce Wayne's bank accounts, using part of the money he obtains to pay Deathstroke, while keeping the rest for himself. Over the following two years, he plans his revenge against Batman and even recruits Deathstroke to his side. At one point, during the events of Batman: Arkham City, he encounters the Joker again, but spares him after he reveals that he had Deathstroke guide him in his quest for vengeance, and that he has high hopes for his plans. Not long after, Jason adopts the \\"Arkham Knight\\" identity and employs his own militia using the money he still has left, whom he trains alongside Deathstroke. He also steals all of Batman's schematics to use his own arsenal and tactics against him for when the time to exact revenge would come. The events of the comics lead into Batman: Arkham Knight. =DC Bombshells= In the DC Bombshells continuity, Jas√≥n was a child from the Basque Country in Spain who aided Kate Kane and Renee Montoya during the Spanish Civil War. Kate called him her \\"pettirojo\\" (Robin) and her \\"Capucho Rojo\\" (Red Hood). Jas√≥n was the rebellion's mascot, often carrying their flag and using his street smarts to help Kate and Renee in various scenarios. He is eventually shot and killed by Cheetah during one of their battles. Batwoman told Huntress of his story in an attempt to convince her not to risk her life so often through rebellion.DC Bombshells #16 In the Bombshells United storyline, Kate Kane and Renee Montoya meet Talia al Ghul and Cheetah in an underground labyrinth. Cheetah regrets her past deeds and resurrects Jas√≥n using a Lazarus Pit.Bombshells United Digital Issue #18 Though the group is happy for a time, Jas√≥n begins to become belligerent and regret being resurrected. Upon meeting another man who had previously been brought back by the Lazarus Pit and had turned into a Minotaur, he realizes a similar fate will befall him the longer he stays alive.Bombshells United #22 After bidding everyone farewell, he, the Minotaur, and the similarly resurrected Isis commit suicide by walking back into the Lazarus Pit.Bombshells United #23 =Injustice 2= As revealed in the prequel comic to the Injustice 2 video game, this version of Jason was murdered by the Joker, with Superman also mentioning him alongside various other Robins to taunt Batman. He was resurrected by Ra's Al Ghul and began working for Ghul's cause as an impostor Batman, who uses guns. He is later convinced by Damian to turn against Ra's when Ra's takes it too far by using Amazo to slaughter millions.Injustice 2 #46 =Batman: White Knight= In the Batman: White Knight continuity, Jason Todd took the mantle of Robin before Dick Grayson did, and in some point of the story, he was captured and tortured by the Joker, who was trying to make him tell him Batman's secret identity. Harley Quinn stopped him before he could kill Jason and called Batman for help. But when they returned to the hideout, Todd had disappeared. They couldn't find him and Jason was presumed dead. Some time later, after the Joker's cured from his insanity, Harleen tells him about Jason, and Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) says that he can't remember what happened to Todd. Dick tells Barbara that Jason was Bruce's favorite.Batman: White Knight #2Batman: White Knight #3 Later, Jack reveals to Batman that he remembered what he did with Jason after he tortured him. Jack reveals that Jason eventually broke from the torture and said \\"I wish I'd never met Bruce Wayne\\", and that Joker let Jason go free. Batman then asks why Jason never returned to him, Jack says that the Joker was jealous of Robin for knowing who Batman was and Jason hated him so much for making him Robin that he disappeared.Batman: White Knight #7 In the final issue of the sequel series, Curse of the White Knight, an adult Jason appears to speak with the recently imprisoned Bruce, arrested after turning himself in for his unintentional crimes as Batman. It‚Äôs shown that Jason had enlisted in the military sometime after his escape from the Joker. Bruce eventually managed to track him down before his arrest, and requests the GCPD appoint Jason as his guard in order to allow them to talk. (Though the issue ends before it‚Äôs shown what they discuss.) =Batman: The Adventures Continue= Jason Todd appears Batman: The Adventures Continue comic book series, which is set in the continuity of the DC Animated Universe. Throughout the earlier issues of the series, Jason appears as a mysterious, shadowed figure constantly spying on Batman and his allies. This version has streaks of white hair that used to be brown before the Joker electrocuted him. Jason was orphaned at a young age alongside his older brother, Danny. Danny joined a street gang called \\"The Wolves\\" in an effort to make more money for them, but he died when the gang leader forced him to don a red hood and act as lookout during one of their robberies for his initiation. When Batman tracked the gang to their hideout, he finds a young Jason fighting off most of the criminals to avenge his brother. Bruce stops Jason from killing the gang members and decides to take him as his ward after learning what happened to his family. He eventually becomes the second Robin, but leaves after Bruce condemns him for almost killing Scarecrow and tries convincing himself it was due to the fear gas. As a solo act, Robin displayed a much more aggressive approach to criminals and Batman's rogues gallery before he was captured by the Joker and Harley Quinn. Joker brutally beats Jason with a crowbar before Batman arrives to stop him. As the hideout comes crashing down from hydrogen tank explosions, the critically injured Robin asks Batman to finish the Joker off, but is outraged when Batman chooses to save Joker instead. He seemingly dies after more hydrogen tanks explode between them and Batman isn't able to find his body. During the \\"Red Son Rising\\" storyline, Bruce discovers that Jason is alive after finding his finger prints on his bullets following a battle with the Joker. He now operates as the Red Hood to honor his deceased brother and plans to get revenge on the Joker and Batman.Batman: The Adventures Continue #9-12 In other media =Television= *Robin in The New Batman Adventures is named Tim Drake, but his characterization is a combination of both Tim and Jason Todd. He has Jason's origin story, as a young thief living on the streets and the son of a criminal working for Two-Face but has his comic book counterpart's knack for excellent detective skills. The writers had wanted to adapt Batman: A Death in the Family, but had to abandon it as the story was too dark. However, his capture and torture at the Joker's hands in the film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker could be seen as a reference to the storylineBatman: The Animated Series ‚Äì Volume 2, Robin Rising Featurette. Commentary by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. * Jason Todd is alluded in the Teen Titans animated series. In the episode \\"X\\", he is listed by Beast Boy as one of Red X's theoretical identities. * Jason Todd has a cameo appearance in a New Teen Titans short on DC Nation. When the Teen Titans try to unmask the mysterious supervillain, Jason is one of Red X's many disguises. After escaping with Red X's identity still anonymous, Beast Boy yells, \\"I still think you're Jason Todd!\\" before being silenced by Red X. * Jason Todd is alluded in the Teen Titans Go! animated series. In the episode \\"Sidekicks\\", a jar labeled Robin II is seen on Batman's souvenir shelf along with a crowbar beside, implied to be his ashes. In the episode \\"Salty Codgers\\", Jason's tombstone appears during the song Last Breath alongside the graves of Boston Brand, Thomas Wayne, Martha Wayne and General Zod. In the episode \\"TV Knight 2\\", his skeleton can be seen in a display tube in the background as Batman attempts to sneak the Joker and the Penguin in through the window. This skeleton has a crack in the skull and a crowbar hanging on the wall next to it. In the episode \\"Real Origins\\", there is a Red Hood icon wearing a safety helmet with two crowbars behind it seen when Robin accesses the computer to look for recruits to form the Teen Titans. He is also mentioned in the episode \\"Egg Hunt\\". * Jason Todd appears in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Josh Keaton. During the five-year period after season one, it's revealed that Jason became Dick Grayson's replacement as Robin on the team, but died under unknown circumstances with Tim Drake as his successor.

In Young Justice: Outsiders, a mysterious character credited as \\"Red Hooded Ninja\\", is a reference to his Red Hood persona. The hood and mask he is wearing could be a reference to his current costume in Red Hood: Outlaw Curran Walters as Jason Todd / Robin in Titans * Jason Todd appears in the live-action series Titans, portrayed by Curran Walters. Introduced as Batman's current sidekick following Dick Grayson's departure, he is given the character's post-Crisis on Infinite Earths backstory as a troubled young man who became the new Robin after attempting to steal the Batmobile's tires. When members of Dick's former circus troupe are murdered by Nick Zucco, who blames Dick for his father's death, Jason and Dick team up to apprehend Nick. Tensions later surface between the two Robins when Jason brutalizes a group of police officers, citing a hatred for the police due to frequent beatings they gave him. After returning to Gotham, he is sought out by Hank Hall and Dawn Granger when Rachel Roth telepathically informs Dawn that she needs Jason's help. Walters also appears as Todd in the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Along with the former Titans, Jason travels to Ravens mothers home to save her from Trigon where he is placed under a hallucination where Dick tries to kill him as he believes Jason will eventually break and start killing criminals and police alike, only for Jason to use the gun which killed Bruce's parents to kill Dick, turning Jason to Trigon's control. He and the other Titans beat Beast Boy to near death to break Rachel's heart and empower Trigon but are released from his control once Raven defeats him. When Dick returns to Wayne Manor with Jason, Bruce asks him to take Jason into the newly reformed Titans with Gar and Rachel, as he had been exhibiting anti-social and violent behaviour. When there, Jason is repeatedly kept out of discussions between Dick and the older Titans due to his age and perceived inexperience. To prove them wrong, Jason tracks the resurfaced Titan villain Dr. Light to the subway tunnels and defeats him in combat, only for Deathstroke to appear and kidnap him, telling the Titans he would return him in exchange for his daughter Rose, who had recently been taken in by the Titans after escaping from Slade. Dick offers himself in exchange for Jason without telling the other Titans and meets with Deathstroke in a high rise building. Deathstroke explains to Dick he was never going to accept the deal and reveals Jason tied to a window cleaning platform outside and attempts to kill him by using explosives to cut the support lines. Managing to untie himself during the ensuing battle between Dick, Kory and Slade, Jason jumps from the platform as it falls and is grabbed by Dick, though Jason's hand begins to slip and he falls from the skyscraper, only to be saved mid-fall by the passing Superboy. Traumatised and bullied once he returns to Titans Tower, Jason attempts to commit suicide by jumping from the top of the Tower, but is talked down by Dick who reveals he is the reason Deathstroke has returned to hunt the Titans. Jason leaves Titans tower with Rose who then confesses to him that she had been working as a mole with Slade the entire time but can no longer work with him after what had happened. Hurt, Jason leaves Rose and stays in Gotham, though he returns to pay respect from afar at the funeral of Donna Troy. Jason will become the Red Hood in season 3. * Jason Todd is mentioned in Harley Quinn. In the episode, \\"All the Best Inmates Have Daddy Issues,\\" when Batman interrogates Joker about a bomb he planted in Gotham City, but Joker mockingly tells Batman to ask Robin, before reminding him that he killed Jason Todd. =Film= Live action *Jason Todd's vandalized Robin suit is seen on display in the 2016 superhero film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Following a behind-the-scenes video was released for the DC Extended Universe, it is revealed that the suit did indeed belong to Jason who was killed by the Joker before the events of the film and is labeled as such at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. According to director Zack Snyder, the suit was originally intended to belong to Dick Grayson during the film's early stages of development. *Harley Quinn's criminal profile in Suicide Squad (2016) reveals she assisted the Joker in murdering Jason. *In response to a tweet suggesting he should play the DC Comics character Static in a live-action role, actor John Boyega suggested that he would be too old to star in the role and that he would be interested in seeing a newcomer cast as Static, while himself expressing interest in playing the Red Hood. Animation Jason Todd in Batman: Under the Red Hood as Red Hood (left) and as Robin (center and right). * Jason Todd makes his animated debut in the 2010 animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood, with the Red Hood voiced by Jensen Ackles, and Robin voiced by Vincent Martella (teenaged iteration) and Alexander Martella (child version). Jason first met Batman when he stole the Batmobile's tires in Crime Alley. The Dark Knight then pitied Jason and took him in to take up the Robin mantle after Dick Grayson became Nightwing. Though gifted in both mind and body, time passed and Jason grew increasingly violent, not understanding why his mentor did not kill the criminals they faced. When Ra's al Ghul hired the Joker to distract the Dynamic Duo, Robin sought to kill the Joker while Batman fought the villain's goons. However, the Joker had set a trap and captured Jason before brutally beating him with a crowbar. The Joker then left Jason's severely injured body in a warehouse set to explode. Before Batman could get to him in time, Jason perished in the explosion. Feeling guilt for inadvertently causing Jason's death, Ra's retrieved his body and resurrected him with a Lazarus Pit. However, the effects drove Jason insane, and subsequently disappeared after escaping Ra's compound. Five years later, he returns to Gotham City under the Red Hood alias, convincing all of Gotham's gangsters to join him in overtaking Gotham's most powerful crime lord Black Mask. After encountering Batman and Nightwing, Red Hood's taunting reveals his knowledge of the Dark Knight's secret identity, and Batman eventually learns that his former partner had returned from the dead under the Joker's former criminal identity. Red Hood then attacked the Black Mask, prompting the crime lord to break the Joker out of prison to help due to his difficulty to infiltrate his killer's heavily guarded cell. After capturing the Joker, Jason lures Batman to an abandoned building where the three of them exchange words. Jason states that he forgave Batman for not saving him, but is angered that Batman had allowed the Joker to live, and continue murdering for years after his death; Todd thinks his own death should have been the final straw. After Batman disarms Jason, the former Boy Wonder activates explosives placed throughout the building, resulting in Batman apprehending the Joker once more. After the explosion, Jason's body is nowhere to be found, leaving his fate ambiguous. * Jason Todd has a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film Batman: The Killing Joke. A picture of Robin's beaten body is shown in the Batcave. * Three boys named Dick, Jason and Tim appears in Batman: Gotham by Gaslight trying to rob a couple before being stopped by Batman. Jason is voiced by Grey Griffin. * A Feudal Japan version of Red Hood appears in the anime film Batman Ninja, voiced by Akira Ishida and Yuri Lowenthal in Japanese and English respectively. * The Jason Todd version of Red Hood appears as the main antagonist turned supporting protagonist of the 2019 Lego-themed animated film Lego DC Batman: Family Matters, voiced by Jason Spisak. Rather than being kidnapped and murdered by the Joker, Jason simply left Batman after believing that he didn't care for him and later adopted the Red Hood persona in an attempt to exact revenge on Batman. In the film, Red Hood teams up with Two-Face to achieve this and places 5 bombs throughout Gotham, challenging the Bat-Family (Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Batwoman) to get them all. While they succeed, Red Hood kidnaps each of them and takes over the Batcave. When Batman arrives, he deduces that Jason is Red Hood and apologizes to him. Making amends with Batman, Jason releases the Bat-Family and reveals that the bombs contained confetti. He later helps Batman take down Two-Face. * Jason Todd appears as the main character in the interactive film adaptation of Batman: Death in the Family, which is a follow-up to Batman: Under the Red Hood, with Vinent Martella reprising his role. Much like the 900 number toll of the original storyline, the movie allows the viewers multiple options to choose from to determine Jason's fate. If they choose for Jason to die, the events of Batman: Under the Red Hood play out naturally. If they choose for Jason to cheat death, the trauma from his injuries and resentment towards Bruce and the Bat- Family for their effect on him leads him to get revenge by becoming Hush. If they choose for Batman to sacrifice himself to save Jason, Jason attempts to avenge Bruce by becoming the violent vigilante Red Robin or he attempts to uphold Bruce's moral code as the Red Hood. =Video games= * The Red Hood appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Troy Baker. * The Red Hood appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super- Villains, with Cameron Bowen reprising his role. * The Red Hood will appear as one of the four main playable characters in the 2021 video game, Gotham Knights voiced by Stephen Oyoung. Batman: Arkham Jason Todd appears in the Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham series, voiced again by Troy Baker. * Jason is indirectly mentioned in Batman: Arkham City. The Joker would sometimes say \\"Didn't I kill you already?\\" whilst the player is playing as Robin (Tim Drake) in one of the game's challenge maps. * Jason, as the Arkham Knight, is the titular secondary antagonist of Batman: Arkham Knight. He joins forces with Scarecrow, whom he supplies with his militia to aid him with his plans to destroy Gotham City with his fear toxin in exchange for assistance in exacting revenge on Batman. On Halloween night, after Scarecrow causes a citywide evacuation, the militia forcefully occupies Gotham, leading to Batman attempting to stop them. While the Arkham Knight confronts Batman at various moments throughout the game and gets the chance to kill him, he is stopped from doing so by Scarecrow, who first wants to break Batman's psychic. Batman has trouble deducing the Arkham Knight's identity, as he still believes Jason to be dead; various flashbacks throughout the game reveal that Jason was captured and tortured by the Joker in an abandoned wing aof Arkham Asylum during his time as the second Robin, with Batman being unable to find and rescue him. The Joker even sent Batman a video tape in which he shot and apparently killed Jason to torment him. Ultimately, the Arkham Knight is unmasked as Jason, and reveals to Batman that the Joker spared him, predicting that he would attempt to exact revenge on Batman for supposedly abandoning him. After a final fight with Batman, Jason is defeated and vanishes. He later adopts the Red Hood alias and seemingly forgives Batman, as he comes to his aid during his final confrontation with Scarecrow. Not long after, Batman apparently commits suicide in order to protect his loved ones, after his secret identity was revealed by Scarecrow. **Jason, as the Red Hood, is a playable character via downloadable content. He was included in his self- titled expansion pack, which also features four challenge maps and a story- driven mission for the character. In his mission, set after the events of Arkham Knight, Red Hood, now a vigilante with lethal methods of dealing with criminals, sets out to track down Black Mask. After finding and defeating him, the crime lord begs for his life, promising to do whatever Red Hood demands him to. The vigilante ironically responds \\"How about you go to Hell!\\" and throws him out a window; quipping \\"Say hi to Joker from me\\" as Black Mask falls to his death. Red Hood was eventually made available for all of the game's challenge maps, with the Arkham Knight as an alternate costume. * The video tape of the Joker \\"killing\\" Jason can be viewed in Batman: Arkham VR. Injustice * The Arkham Knight is playable in the mobile app version of Injustice: Gods Among Us. * The Red Hood appears as a playable character via downloadable content in Injustice 2, voiced by Cameron Bowen. He is also briefly mentioned in the story during Damian Wayne's argument with Batman, when the former reminds the Dark Knight of all the people who died because of the Joker, whom Batman spared time and time again. In his Arcade ending, following Brainiac's defeat, Red Hood refuses to side with either Batman or Superman; while he agrees with the latter that criminals deserve to die, he doesn't approve of Superman's dictatorial rule. As such, while the World's Finest are busy fighting each other, Red Hood focuses on protecting the weak and innocent.

History Leonora in 1899 The first European explorer was John Forrest, who visited the area in 1869. On 21 June 1869 Forrest's party made camp near a conspicuous hill, which Forrest named Mount Leonora, after his six-year-old niece Frances (Fanny) Leonora Hardey. In 1895, gold was discovered in the area by prospector Edward \\"Doodah\\" Sullivan at the Johannesburg lease just north of the current townsite. In the following two years a number of rich finds resulted in rapid development of the area. The Sons of Gwalia gold mine brought Leonora to the attention of the world. By 1897 a residential and business area had been established, and the town was gazetted as Leonora. Leonora had a single track passenger tramway linking the town and nearby Gwalia, from 1901 to 1921. Initially steam driven, the service was electric from November 1908, and petrol powered from 1915. A reverse osmosis desalination treatment plant was opened in October 2005 to improve the quality of the town's water supply from the Station Creek wellfield by reducing the naturally occurring high levels of salinity, nitrate and hardness. It was designed to supply 2.5 million litres of treated water per day. In 2010, the Rudd Government relocated asylum seekers from Christmas Island to the \\"Leonora Alternative Place of Detention\\", an immigration detention centre, previously used as a mine workers hostel, in Leonora. The Abbott Government closed the facility in February 2014. Economy Leonora is primarily a mining town. There are a number of major gold mines in the Shire, as well as the Murrin Murin laterite nickel project. The area supports a significant pastoral industry. Demographics At the 2016 census, Leonora had a population of 556, 27.6% of whom were of Aboriginal descent. Climate The area has an arid climate (BWh), with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost may occur occasionally on some winter mornings. Rainfall is very sparse.

The character first appeared in Showcase #4 (October 1956), created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino. Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash, who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick. Because he is a speedster, his power consists mainly of superhuman speed. Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of molecular vibrations, including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring. Barry Allen's classic stories introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics, and this concept played a large part in DC's various continuity reboots over the years. The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC's major company-wide reboot stories, and in the crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths #8 (Nov. 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse, removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative (and a single image of a blur) in Grant Morrison's crossover story Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #3 (Nov. 2008), fully actualized in Geoff Johns' accompanying The Flash: Rebirth #1 (June 2009), kicking off a six-issue limited series. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories Blackest Night (2009), Flashpoint (2011), Convergence (2015), and DC Rebirth (2016). Barry Allen has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program. Since then he has appeared in several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor John Wesley Shipp portrayed the character in the live- action 1990s television show The Flash and the Arrowverse. Allen is currently portrayed by Grant Gustin in the Arrowverse shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series The Flash, while Ezra Miller portrays the character in Crisis on Infinite Earths and the DC Extended Universe films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League, and will return in the 2022 film The Flash. Fictional character biography Showcase#4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash. Art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Kubert.Barry Allen is a police scientist (his job was later changed to a forensic investigator) with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc√©e, Iris West. When Barry was a child, his mother was murdered, and Barry's father was unjustly blamed. It was actually the Reverse-Flash. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, Jay Garrick), and becomes Central City's resident costumed crime fighter and protector. Central City University professor Ira West (Iris's adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity. The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise time travel and was used in many stories. Allen was warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much to the extent that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. Batman once said \\"Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.\\"Justice #8 (Dec. 2006) =Justice League= As presented in Justice League of America #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by alien warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, the heroes decide to establish the Justice League. During the years, he is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to Black Canary and Zatanna, but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), which would later be the subject of the limited series Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold. In The Flash # 123‚Äî\\"Flash of Two Worlds\\"‚ÄîAllen is transported to Earth-Two where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on Earth-One. This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of Flash and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the Justice Society of America of Earth-Two. In the classic story from Flash #179‚Äî\\"The Flash ‚Äì Fact or Fiction?\\"‚ÄîAllen is thrown into the universe eventually called Earth Prime, a representation of \\"our\\" universe, where he seeks the aid of the Flash comic book's editor Julius Schwartz to build a cosmic treadmill so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and prot√©g√© in Iris' nephew, Wally West, who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers. =Tragedy= In time, he married his girlfriend Iris West, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept this secret, and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno's persuasion.The Flash #174 Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted. In the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse. Iris is murdered by Professor Zoom (a supervillain from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fianc√©e eventually descends into madness and stomps out of the room walking in somber. Placed on trial for murder in connection with Zoom's death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that Abra Kadabra was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash's good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris' spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of The Flash ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption \\"And they lived happily ever after... for a while\\". There are a few references in the final issue (The Flash #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash's impending death. In the controversial storyline Identity Crisis (sets within the post- Zero Hour continuity), it is revealed that Barry voted to allow Zatanna to edit Doctor Light's mind with four of the members of the Justice League six months after Iris's death, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, they have his memories edited as well despite the opposition from Green Arrow. Both Doctor Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe, leading Doctor Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman's distrust towards his allies. =Crisis on Infinite Earths= Following the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. After only a few weeks of happiness, the Crisis on Infinite Earths intervenes, and Allen is captured by the Anti-Monitor and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body. It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the Speed Force, the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, Kid Flash Wally West, his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash. After death Marv Wolfman, scribe for the Crisis on Infinite Earths, has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original Crisis collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced, without a retcon, into DC Universe continuity. This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others. It should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have \\"died\\" in Crisis on Infinite Earths, was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon. After this act, according to Secret Origins Annual #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash. In Deadman: Dead Again, Barry is one of the heroes whose spirit Deadman helps to enter Heaven, and the Green Arrow storyline \\"Quiver\\" depicts Barry Allen in Heaven. His spirit seems to still be alive within the Speed Force, along with Max Mercury and other speedsters. In Quasar by Marvel Comics, released between December 1990 and May 1994, an amnesiac Barry Allen, misremembering his name as \\"Buried Alien\\" and the Speed Force as the \\"Hyperforce\\", and surprised to have \\"form\\" again, enters the Marvel Universe in the middle of the great race to be the \\"Fastest Man Alive\\" after the players had passed the first warp junction, where he is discovered by the Runner co-ordinating it and invited to participate in his great race. Beating several other speedsters (Pietro \\"Quicksilver\\" Maximoff, Wendell \\"Quasar\\" Vaughn, Robert \\"The Whizzer\\" Frank, Captain Marvel, James \\"Speed Demon\\" Sanders, Ariana \\"Black Racer\\", Martin \\"Super Sabre\\" Fletcher and Makkari) he is declared to be the \\"fastest man alive\\", a title he believes feels \\"right\\", though he never recovers his memory during his time in the universe. He later adopted the alias \\"FastForward\\", before he is returned to his original universe with Makkari's assistance. =Legacy= Iris is pregnant, and she has two children who have super-speed powers, the Tornado Twins, who later meet the Legion of Super-Heroes. In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire XS, while the other, Bart Allen, is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of Max Mercury, and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the Teen Titans. One year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone Inertia and the Rogues. Wally then retook the identity of the Flash. Bart would later be resurrected as Kid Flash by the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st century to combat Superboy-Prime. =JLA/Avengers= Barry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing, along with Hal Jordan. When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the Grandmaster shows the heroes how reality should be, but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and Kyle Rayner, in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into Krona's base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the Wasp, he is ordered by Captain America to find ways through Krona's defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves Hawkeye from being killed when the Absorbing Man breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by Dreamslayer. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America's suggestion they laid low and because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona's machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him, then Barry takes the 12 items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns. =Post-Crisis appearances= Wally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of Zoom, regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time‚Äîstating that he is from a period shortly before his death‚Äîcounseling his nephew, and talking the Spectre into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry's identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his \\"own\\" Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved Eobard Thawne from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and breaking his enemy's neck in his timeline. Infinite Crisis In the fourth issue of Infinite Crisis, Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with Johnny Quick and Max Mercury, to help his grandson Bart deal with Superboy-Prime, taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of Infinite Crisis #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in Infinite Crisis #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more. In Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before Infinite Crisis #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate Keystone City along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated. =Return= Black Racer. Art from Final Crisis #2 by J. G. Jones. Twenty three years after his death in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Barry Allen's essence made a return to the present DC Universe proper in DC Universe #0, preceding his full-time return in the pages of writer Grant Morrison's Final Crisis. DC Universe #0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with \\"everything\\". As the story progresses, he begins to recall his past and association with Justice League members, particularly Hal Jordan and Superman. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking \\"I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism\\". Yet he is still the only one able to see \\"the shadow falling over everything\\", in the form of Darkseid. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks \\"and now I remember\\". The title of the story is revealed to be \\"Let There Be Lightning\\". A Daily News story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co- writer Geoff Johns stating, \\"When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.\\" Final Crisis Barry makes his corporeal return in Final Crisis #2. On the second to last page, Jay Garrick and Wally West feel vibrations to which Jay remarks, \\"but, don't you recognize those vibrations? It can't be... Not after all these years... Not after all this time.\\" On the final page, Barry Allen is seen in hot pursuit of the bullet which kills Orion, outrunning the Black Racer and shouting to Jay and Wally to \\"Run!\\" During Final Crisis #3, Jay Garrick speaks to Barry's wife, Iris, and tells her that her husband is truly alive. Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion's death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by Wonder Woman, Batwoman, Catwoman, and Giganta, who have all been transformed into the new Female Furies following the release of the Anti-Life Equation. Despite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by Libra and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry's expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth. Barry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the Anti-Life Equation. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation. The Allens and Wally West are left to fend in a conquered world. In the seventh and final issue of Final Crisis, Barry and Wally lead the Black Racer to Darkseid, dealing the cosmic tyrant a blow that, coupled with Batman shooting him in the shoulder with the god-bullet, would facilitate his ultimate defeat. The Flash: Rebirth In 2009, writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver created The Flash: Rebirth, a 6-issue miniseries bringing Barry Allen back to a leading role in the DC Universe as the Flash, much in the same vein as Green Lantern: Rebirth. When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, \\"All of them.\\" The series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, \\"Central City's Flash\\", Wonder Woman having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the Flash Museum and from his friend Hal Jordan is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. \\"I can't be late,\\" he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, \\"For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.\\" It is then revealed that Flash's mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as \\"the only one open case I left behind.\\" Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain Savitar escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar's shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, \\"...You were the beginning, Allen...and you're the end.\\" At that moment, Wally West, West's children Iris and Jai, Liberty Belle, Jay Garrick, and Kid Flash all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning. Barry's conflict with the speed cult culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar's death. It causes pain once again to all the speedsters, though Wally West manages to catch a glimpse of Allen directly afterwards, and sees him as the new Black Flash. When he realizes that his presence could damage or kill other innocents, Barry flees back into the Speed Force, where he encounters old friends Johnny Quick and Max Mercury. Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault. When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force, the real culprit reveals himself: Professor Zoom. Zoom reveals his plan: after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy-Prime during the Infinite Crisis, Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry's self-awareness. This led to the hero's reappearance during the Final Crisis. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into \\"a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom. The seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away. He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry, including the murder of Barry's mother, was caused by Zoom. Zoom then decides to destroy everything by killing Barry's wife, Iris, before they met. Barry chases after Zoom, and is joined by Wally, who tells Barry to push as hard as he can to break the time barrier. They reach Thawne, becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late. Blackest Night Barry Allen as a member of the Blue Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night event. Cover art to Blackest Night: The Flash #3 by Scott Kolins. Barry Allen is one of the main characters in Blackest Night alongside Hal Jordan. Allen appears alongside Jordan in the Free Comic Book Day issue Blackest Night #0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover. At the grave of Bruce Wayne in Gotham City, Hal and Barry reflect on Batman's death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman. This reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's death engendered in others while Hal's death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \\"I died a sinner. You died a saint.\\" (though he admits he's not and reflecting of his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming \\"more dangerous\\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths of Arthur Curry and Martian Manhunter cost the Justice League its \\"heart and soul\\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them. He specifically cites Batman noting, \\"If there's an escape, you can bet Batman's already planning it.\\" Barry also appears alongside Hal in the July issues of Green Lantern tying into the event. Recently, in a fight with Black Lantern J'onn J'onzz, he found a mysterious black residue at Bruce Wayne's grave‚Äîa black form coagulating much like blood that started corrupting him by partly decaying his skin and muscle during the fight against his former friend, who is intent on killing both Hal and Barry, seeing how they both died, and in the eyes of the Black Lanterns, must return to that state to keep the universe in balance. After fighting off the undead Martian and the subsequent Black Lanterns with Hal and the arriving Atom, Mera, Firestorm, and two of the Indigo Tribe members, Barry, along with Wally and Bart, races across the globe to warn every superhero community across the planet. His message also inadvertently warns the Rogues. They all realize that their deceased members would come after them and decide to strike first at Iron Heights Penitentiary, unaware that the undead Rogues are ready for them. While doing so, Barry meets a Black Lantern version of Professor Zoom for a brief battle. Barry decides to go to Gorilla City to seek aid from its ruler Solovar, unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before. Finding the city attacked, Barry assumed Grodd had struck only to be horrified to learn Solovar was now a Black Lantern. Their fight was shortened by Barry racing to Coast City. He stops at the city's memorial, where he witnesses the arrival of the Black Lanterns' demonic lord, Nekron, and his disciples Scar and Black Hand. The Justice League, the Titans, Wally, and Bart arrive to aid Barry to take a stand against Nekron. Nekron reveals that all the resurrected heroes are tied to him, because he allowed them to rise again. As such they belong to him. Nekron then used a series of black rings to turn Superman, Wonder Woman, Troia, Green Arrow, Bart, and several other resurrected heroes into Black Lanterns. Barry and Hal find themselves being targeted by black rings and are forced to flee or risk joining the others as Black Lanterns. Barry manages to save himself and Hal through time travel two seconds forward, leaving the rings with no present targets. As Barry and Hal rejoin the heroes against Nekron and his army, Ganthet, one of the Guardians of the Universe and a leader of the Blue Lantern Corps, summons a blue power ring and Barry is chosen as a Blue Lantern so he would be more effective during the battle. After being chosen as a Blue Lantern, Barry joins forces with the veteran Blue Corps member Saint Walker to continue battling the Black Lanterns alongside the understanding of the potentials and limitations of his new power ring. During the battle, Barry is forced to fight his own grandson, who his ring detects is still alive but would eventually die if not free from the black ring soon. Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and an ability of flight (possibly because of the understanding with Hal's ring), as he is able to create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him in order to make him feel again. Barry's plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past and the constructs begin to attempt to take the black ring from him, but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar. Wally and Walker later join Barry to fight against them. Barry and Bart temporarily joined the White Lantern Corps during the final events of Blackest Night. =The Flash Volume 3= The new Flash series begins after the completion of Blackest Night and the beginning of Brightest Day. After the events of The Flash: Rebirth, Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in Central City. Under the cover of having been in witness protection, Allen returns to the Central City Police Department's crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash. While readjusting to life as the Flash, a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the Mirror Master, and promptly dies on the street. When Barry arrives on the scene to investigate, he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder, or the current Rogue, Evan McCulloch. Hearing of another portal appearing, Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate. When he arrives, a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues, called The Renegades appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century, and that he is under arrest for murdering the \\"Mirror Monarch\\". Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone, to which their leader, \\"Commander Cold\\", tells him, \\"Not yet. But you will.\\" After a brief struggle, where Weather Warlock's time disc was damaged, the Renegades were forced back to the 25th century, which also caused the destruction of an apartment building due to their uncontrolled jump back. Barry saves everyone in the building, even rebuilding the building in minutes, and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch. He is attacked again by the Renegades, but only before Captain Boomerang shows up, now wielding explosive energy boomerangs. Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up. The Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says \\"In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass\\". An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris's death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to \\"Throw the Boomerang\\", Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees. In the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, \\"Where are the Mirror Lords?\\" He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris. The story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, Flashpoint. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit)The Flash (Vol. 3) #8 (November 2010) moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance. In a Green Lantern storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, Parallax, after he joins Hal Jordan's quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity's attacks due to his fear for Jordan's safety.Green Lantern vol. 4 #59 (Nov. 2010) Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear. DC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that Flash #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn. Flashpoint As the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman leading their respective nations in a war, his wife Iris West is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of Batman, driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is Thomas Wayne.Flashpoint #1 (May 2011) While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects Professor Zoom's costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.Flashpoint #2 (June 2011) Barry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas' advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry's super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry's injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact Cyborg for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of \\"Project: Superman\\" that is 'raising' Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman's frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman's underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman's powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.Flashpoint #3 (July 2011) While they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry's memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the Marvel Family and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until Enchantress reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry.Flashpoint #4 (August 2011) Professor Zoom reveals to him that the \\"Flashpoint\\" timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he's done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears a voice explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the \\"Flashpoint\\" before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.Flashpoint #5 (August 2011) =The New 52= DC Comics relaunched The Flash with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, The New 52. As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine broke through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him. In the second issue of the new Justice League title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and \\"opening shot\\" of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist Green Lantern and Batman in wrangling an out-of-control Superman, and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of Darkseid. In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker Patty Spivot. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he does not yet exert total control over. As revealed in issue #0 of the current series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority. Barry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched Justice League series, making his debut in the series' second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks. =DC Rebirth= During DC Rebirth, Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that Wally West has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the Flashpoint crisis, the unknown entity used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \\"lightning rod\\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre- Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.DC Universe: Rebirth one-shot (May 2016) Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.The Flash: Rebirth one-shot (June 2016) Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and Wallace, Iris had glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well. Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry.The Flash vol. 5 #24 (August 2017) To make matters worse for Barry, while he's entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative-Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control. After gotten rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates with the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed's help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, he discusses about him telling Iris that he's alive and existed. While he's rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole. After defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry place him under watch at the Sanctuary while he's moving with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier's broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force. He manages to track down the Still Force user Steadfast and the Strength Force user Fuerza to bring them to his team after the Black Flash starts hunting the other force users to prevent them from using their powers as the other forces weaken and deplete the Speed Force. However the Sage Force user Psych refuses to join Barry's team only to be later tracked down and killed by the Black Flash. To safeguard the other force users Barry sends Fuerza and Commander Cold to the Strength Force and stays behind with Steadfast. Soon however Hunter Zolomon arrives, powered with the Sage and Strength Force, claiming to be the \\"one true Flash\\". He defeats Barry and takes Steadfast away to claim the Still Force for himself. Black Flash also arrives and warns the defeated Barry not to interfere in his mission. Zolomon tortures Steadfast to give him the Still Force, but Steadfast resists. Finally a revived Barry tracks down Zolomon and tries to rescue Steadfast but Zolomon's power of other forces prove to much for him. Steadfast tries to use the Still Force to stop both the speedsters, but the plan backfires as Zolomon approaches and takes the Still Force. With the control of all the four forces, Zolomon enters the Forever Force taking Barry with him. Powers and abilities Barry has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the Silver Age described as faster than the speed of thought. Flash #150, \\"straining every muscle\\", he ran at ten times the speed of light. However, when he pushed himself further (during the Crisis on Infinite Earths) he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in Secret Origins Annual #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers. This was later retconned in The Flash: Rebirth #1, where Barry stated that he \\"ran into the Speed Force\\" and that, \\"When he stopped the Anti-Monitor, when (he) ran into the \\"Speed Force\\" and joined it, it was like shedding (his) identity\\". Allen possesses abilities that original Flash Jay Garrick has not always been able to duplicate, and most notably the ability to \\"vibrate\\" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in time travel by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed also allows him, in certain circumstances, to \\"vibrate\\" between dimensions. In Grant Morrison's Final Crisis, using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects of the Anti-Life Equation upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of Darkseid's mind control. Barry's speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through \\"speed-reading\\", he can absorb large amounts of information into his short-term memory, which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building.The Flash (Vol. 3) #2 (May 2010) The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens.The Flash (Vol. 4) #2 (December 2011) Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a metahuman: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.Superman #7 (2012)Voodoo #7 (2012) Rogues gallery The Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains. Their number includes (but is not limited to) several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the Rogues, disdaining the use of the term \\"supervillain\\" or \\"super-criminal\\". These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods. Other versions * Barry Allen is a supporting character in Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again. He has been kept by Lex Luthor as a power source for most of the East Coast, constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or else Iris will be executed. After being rescued, Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman's young assistants deemed as \\"old\\"‚Äî\\"Kids, these days, can't tell the difference between just plain old and classic\\", he mutters. He then aids Batman and other heroes in restoring order, though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long-term strategy. * Barry Allen appears in JLA: Age of Wonder as a scientist working with Superman and a consortium of early twentieth-century scientists such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. His uniform incorporates the Silver Age look with the Mercury-style helmet worn by Jay Garrick. * In League of Justice, a Lord of the Rings-type story, Barry is recast as \\"Phaeton\\", who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash's lightning-bolt chest emblem, and has bathed in dragon's blood in order to protect himself from speed friction. * In Batman: Holy Terror, Barry is one of a number of metahumans imprisoned by a theocratic state, discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government. He then shows Batman some of the attempts to recreate his powers in others, ranging from a man who cannot control his ability to vibrate to a woman whose brain operates at lightspeed while her body is still at normal speed or a man rapidly aging to death. While Barry and Batman are able to defeat the brainwashed Zatanna, Barry is then killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running. * A version of Barry Allen aka Hot Pursuit appeared in the lead into Flashpoint.The Flash (vol. 3) #6 (January 2011) Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit, or how he came to be. The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint. Hot Pursuit's history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.The Flash (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011) \\"Buried Alien\\" * A story in the Marvel comic book series Quasar, written four years after Crisis on Infinite Earths, has the Marvel Universe speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the Runner. The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon. During the race, a surge of energy hits the track, leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots. This being has no memory, but an enormous desire to run. He goes on to win the race, passing Marvel speedsters such as Quicksilver and Speed Demon in the process. When asked what his name is, the man replies, \\"I'm not sure. \\"Buried Alien\\"... Something like that.\\" When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive, he replied, \\"It feels... right.\\"Quasar #17, December 199 The racer goes on to take the name Fast-Forward, disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help Makkari, who is stuck at hyper speed.Quasar #58, May 1994 * In the Elseworlds tale Superman & Batman: Generations, Barry's life is still the same, but heroes age in real time. This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening, so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008. * The Elseworlds story Flashpoint shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956, the year he first appeared in comics. He is more involved in government affairs. By 1963, he has ended the Cold War and pushed the communists out of Vietnam. However, his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at John F. Kennedy. He is paralyzed from the neck down, but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries. By 1988, he and Vandal Savage's Immortality, Inc. have begun an exploration of Mars. In 1998, Wally West leads an expedition to Mars, during which he finds the flashpoint, an object which killed all life on Mars. Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen. Barry makes contact with Wally, who is going on a super speed rampage. Barry is cured and defeats Savage. He then enters the flashpoint, going into the Speed Force. * In The Flash Annual #7, an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash, he became a superstar celebrity. However, Barry was tragically killed while battling Captain Cold. Ten years later, Wally is now a paraplegic and Captain Cold has written a supposedly \\"true\\" story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent. Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen. The resulting film is a success. * The Barry Allen of Earth-51, where secret identities are no longer needed by superheroes, is seen alive. He is subsequently killed by the Monitor of New Earth. * In JLA: The Nail a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later. In lieu of Superboy's adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Flash visited the 30th Century instead. Barry Allen of The Nail is almost identical to the pre-Crisis Earth-1 version, except that his costume resembles Wally's. His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with Amazo where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack. * In the prequel comic to Injustice: Gods Among Us Barry joins Superman's Regime in a more forceful approach to saving the world from crime. However, Barry remains one of the few (alongside Shazam) to maintain some sense of morality, as he is more prone to questioning some of Superman's more drastic actions in the Year One series. Though Batman tries to convince Barry of the Regime's negative influence, he chooses to stay with them, though still tries to convince Superman his more drastic actions will not go down well. In the game, Barry finally defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam for questioning his ethics. He joins the Insurgency and plays a critical role in stopping Superman's dictatorship. While he and the other Regime members are arrested, he is pardoned thanks to Batman vouching for him and given a job at Luthor/Wayne climate research. His superior, Doctor Randall, convinces Barry to become the Flash again to aid the heroes in stopping Brainiac's invasion. * A version of Barry Allen is present through Dark Nights: Metal. This version hails from Earth-Minus-52 of the Dark Multiverse, where Batman became mad due to the deaths of his crimefighting sidekicks. Batman manages to absorb Barry's body, taking the Speed Force for himself and calling himself \\"Red Death\\"; however Barry's mind remains present in Bruce's body, pleading Bruce to stop his dark crusade. When Red Death is hit by the positive energy, Bruce dies, leaving Barry alive and in control of his body, with the costume changing its color from red to gold. Barry tries his best to help his counterpart from Earth-0. However, because Barry from Earth-Minus-52 is a \\"creature of darkness\\", the exposure to the positive energy starts to rip him apart, killing him almost instantly.

It is stated that his father is in prison for killing his mother despite the nine-year-old Barry's insistence that his father was innocent. When Bruce contacts Barry and offers him membership of the team, Barry accepts, also because of a conversation with his father forcing Barry to face the idea that he needs friends, but finds it hard to interact with other people because of his speed. However, he eventually become friends with Victor Stone, and the rest of the League all like Barry's jovial attitude. During the events of the film the team fights Steppenwolf, preventing his Apokoliptian invasion, seemingly preventing the alternate- future events shown in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

He is voiced by George Eads and later by James Arnold Taylor in \\"Endgame\\". He is shown wearing Wally's costume rather than his original Silver Age outfit. Issue #5 of the show's tie-in comic book reveals that rather than gaining his powers from a freak accident, Barry deliberately recreated the lab explosion that gave Jay Garrick his speed abilities back in the 1940s.Young Justice #5 (June 2011) Barry's death in Crisis on Infinite Earths is adapted and substituted with Wally's for the season 2 finale, as the three Flashes band together to deactivate a Reach device.

In the season 11 storyline Haunted, Bart is revealed to have learned those names through his connection to the Speed Force, with the three being other existing speedsters.Smallville season 11 #11 =Arrowverse= John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen / The Flash in the CBS network television series, The Flash. * Barry Allen was the Flash in the 1990s Flash live-action TV series, although this character incorporated elements of Wally West's social life, as well as previously non-existent characters such as a brother and nephew. He was played by John Wesley Shipp. This version of the Flash reaches maximum speed upon breaking the sound barrier, at which point he has to stop to rest. CBS originally wanted to cast Jack Coleman, who declined the role to pursue a career in Broadway. As a police forensic scientist, Barry was working in the crime lab at the Central City Police Department headquarters when a lightning bolt struck his lab, dousing him in a combination of electricity and chemicals nearby. He discovered the accident gave him superhuman speed. With the help of S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Dr. Christina McGee, Barry learned how to control his powers with the help of a special prototype deep-sea diving suit. When Barry's older brother and police colleague Jay Allen was murdered by gang leader and Jay's former police partner Nicholas Pike, Barry wore a masked version of the suit and called himself the Flash. After capturing Pike, Barry sees his potentials of accomplishing some differences with his powers in a crime-ridden Central City, and started helping to bring other criminals to justice and provide hope to people as a masked superhero. Later, the Earth where this Flash lives is designated as Earth-90. Shipp also recurs as Earth-1's Barry Allen's (portrayed by Grant Gustin) father, Dr. Henry Allen, and Henry's Earth-3 equivalent Jay Garrick/The Flash in the 2014 television series. Shipp later reprises his role of 1990 television series for both crossovers \\"Elseworlds\\" and \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", therefore like Garrick, this Flash is also Henry's doppelg√§nger. Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / The Flash in The CW network television series The Flash. * Barry Allen first appears in Arrow, played by Grant Gustin. In the episodes \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Three Ghosts\\", Barry comes to Starling City to investigate a crime which may assist him in solving his mother's strange murder that occurred when he was 11 years old. He also hopes to meet his vigilante idol, the Arrow. Barry discovers that Oliver Queen is the Arrow after the archer's friends recruit him to save Oliver's life, and eventually he and Oliver become friends. Barry would later return after he becomes the Flash, in the crossover episodes \\"The Brave and the Bold\\", \\"Legends of Yesterday\\", and the second parts of \\"Invasion!\\", \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\", \\"Elseworlds\\" and \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". * Gustin as Allen is then spun off into his own The Flash series on the network. which premiered in Fall 2014. The series chronicles Barry's journey to become a hero in his own right once he gained superhuman speed after being struck by lightning during S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator explosion. He fights to protect Central City from the escalating violence of metahuman criminals and occasionally teams with Oliver and other heroes. As the series unfolds, he encounters several nemeses: the future speedster Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash, the Earth-2 speedster Hunter Zolomon/Zoom, a rogue alternate timeline counterpart Savitar, the intellectual Clifford DeVoe/Thinker, and the serial killer Cicada. He gradually develops super-speed-related abilities such as vibrating through solid objects, temporarily absorbing knowledge through speed-reading, or traveling through time and parallel universes. Gustin reprised his role for a crossover with the television series Supergirl episodes \\"Worlds Finest\\" \\"Medusa\\", the first part of \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\", and the third part of \\"Elseworlds\\". ** Gustin also portrayed a non-metahuman Earth-2 doppelg√§nger of Barry Allen, and an evil alternate timeline future-time remnant who calls himself Savitar. ** Originally, Marc Guggenheim confirmed in an interview that Blitzkrieg of Freedom Fighters: The Ray is the Earth-X doppelg√§nger of Barry Allen. However, much of the concepts for Earth-X has changed since the interview and the animated series' production started, with characters such as Black Arrow and Dark Arrow becoming different despite the original intentions. As such, it is unclear whether this information is still relevant to the character Blitzkrieg. He is voiced by Scott Whyte and is an amalgamation of Baron Blitzkrieg, Baroness Blitzkrieg, Blitzen and Nazi Flash. * The Arrowverse Earth-1/Prime Flash, the Earth-90 Flash and the DCEU Flash appeared in the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover played by Grant Gustin, John Wesley Shipp and Ezra Miller respectively.

It is not a specific form of hip-hop but varies in style along the lines of hip-hop in general. Native Americans have been present in hip-hop culture since its inception as breakdancers, DJs, rappers, and graffiti artists. The Native American contribution to hip-hop can occasionally be veiled by the ethnic umbrella term of Hispanic or Latino, terms that do not specifically refer to race. Hip-hop has grown in popularity not only in urban settings but also on reservations since it has become ubiquitous on television and radio. Political activism and its expression in art has also been of great influence due to the many social issues present in indigenous communities. Artists such as John Trudell (with his spoken word poetry), Mildred Bailey (with her contributions to jazz in the 1930s) and Russell Means (with what he calls his rap-ajo music) have been of some influence with their artistic endeavors. Notable artists Snotty Nose Rez Kids is a Canadian Hip-Hop duo of Haisla (Indigenous) descent from Kitimat, BC, composed of rappers Yung Trybez and Young D. Formed in 2016, SNRK released their first self-titled album in January 2017, and followed up that same year with their second full- length, The Average Savage in September 2017. The latter went on to secure them Best Hip Hop Artist at the Western Canadian Music Awards, cemented them on 2018‚Äôs Top 10 list of the coveted Polaris Music Prize, and landed them a 2019 Juno Nomination for best Indigenous Music Album. The group toured heavily in Canada with appearances in New York City, Seattle and Darwin, Australia. They quickly gained notoriety for their energetic, inspiring and thought provoking performances. Melle Mel, the first rapper to ever use the epithet MC, is Cherokee and Ernie Paniccioli, a famous photographer of hip-hop culture who grew up in Brooklyn, is Cree. Funkdoobiest, Sol√©, and Litefoot (winner of the Native American Music Award), are also well-known Native American hip-hop artists. Wu-Tang affiliate King Just is also Native American and the Ol' Dirty Bastard also claimed to be of Native American descent. Flavor Unit member Apache has also been assumed to be Native American, though a reliable source has yet to be found. In the past, the majority of Native American hip hop was to be found in the underground scene, rarely gaining exposure beyond regional hits. However, artists such as Drezus, Frank Waln, Supaman, DJ oTTo and Red Eagle are just a few newer artists that have gained substantial popularity in recent years. Article in Indian Country Frank Waln connects the experiences of Indigenous peoples in North America rising from the aftermath of genocide to the experiences of African Americans who came from slavery. He recognizes that the creators of Hip hop came from situations influenced by slavery and that his situation is similar. He raps about the effects of colonialism on his people in his song My Stone, and he uses Hip hop to survive and get through his situation that was influenced by the exploitation of his people. Indigenous youth are able to use Hip hop to understand themselves and the socioeconomic processes that affect their lives. Themes in Indigenous Hip hop include colonialism, dispossession, and racialization ‚Äì all of which have affected Indigenous youth in North America. Some Indigenous artists worry that their blend of traditional music with their own may be seen as disrespectful to their ancestors. However, many elders and Hip hop listeners are able to appreciate the mixture, as it can bring multiple generations together through music. You can find early rock rap groups such as WithoutReservation and Atlan Underground, were the first to bridge the gap between rock, punk and hip hop. With the help of United Roots Oakland, Desirae Harp, a member of the Mishewal Wappo tribe, collaborated with two rappers, Fly50 and SeasunZ, on their song \\"Solarize.\\" The collaborating artists comment on environmental issues caused by pollution, abandonment, and negligence that needs to be addressed. Kemozabi, a Wyandot DJ from the all native FBI crew, is well known in the underground for his participation in many DJ competitions such as the DMC and Scribble Jam. He was consistently placed second and third in many competitions such as the 2004 Montreal and Edmonton DMC competitions, and the 2005 Moncton and North Bay DMC competitions. War Party became the first native performers to host RapCity. War Party is one of a number of Canadian groups to gain some chart success, including Tru Rez Crew and Slangblossom. Hatchet Warrior, the second album by Native American hip hop artist Anybody Killa, was released in 2003, and peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the Billboard 200. Reddnation, a group from Alberta has become decorated ‚Äì having received awards for 'Best Rap/Hip Hop CD' and 'Best Duo/Group' at the Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards for their second album Now or Never, Best Rap or Hip-Hop Album at the 2006 Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards, 'Best Group or Duo' & 'Best Rap or Hip- Hop Album' at the 2007 Alberta Aboriginal Music Awards, and 'Best Group or Duo' at the 2007 Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. The organization Beat Nation is a Canadian not-for-profit Indigenous Hip hop collective with the goal of giving public space to Indigenous artists and their listeners. It is run through a website and exhibits which aim to share Beat Nation's work and music, as well as give space for Indigenous Hip hop culture to operate. Artists in the collective include Corey Bulpitt, Andrew Dexel, Bracken Hanuse Corlett, Bunky Echo-Hawk, Cheryl L‚ÄôHirondelle, Doreen Manuel, Jackson 2bears, Jolene Nenibah Yazzie, Jordan Bennet, Kevin Lee Burton, Leena Minifie, Morgan Green, Nicholas Galanin, Rose Simpson, Sonny Assu, and the Native Youth Artist Collective. Rapper Young Kidd from Winnipeg, Manitoba is of Jamaican and Aboriginal heritage, and two of the trio group, Winnipeg's Most, are Aboriginal - Jon C and Brooklyn. Winnipeg's Most have won several Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. Both Young Kidd and Winnipeg's Most have achieved high levels of local success in Winnipeg. Frank Waln, a Sicangu Lakota, and other newer hip hop and pop artists of Aboriginal descent were featured on MTV's Rebel Music in late 2014 for both their music and community advocacy work in various Aboriginal causes. Florida rapper Denzel Curry, a pioneer of the Cloud Rap and Soundcloud Rap scene, is of Bahamian and Native American heritage. Albuquerque DJ and EBM artist oTTo TO is Cherokee, Mi'kmaq ,African American and Caucasian. Lil Cory is Cherokee, descending from Moytoy of Tellico and belongs to the Quatsy Wolf Clan. Early Internet pioneering The first url dedicated to native hip hop in the north was REDHIPHOP.COM which was started in DEC. of 1999 it was unlike other existing online databases where is it was a stand alone site with no umbrella site, ie Yahoo or geocities. This site has individual artist section and playable and even downloadable mp3s. Unlike the native hip hop geocities group this iste had working contracts with artists involved - This site was started by Manik out of the REDWIRE MAGAZINE office. At that time there was already a geocities group which served as the first online database. After REDHIPHOP.COM .. ww.nativehiphop.net followed suit and bought its own url. Stretching back as early as October 17, 2000, one of the main websites promoting Native hip hop performers has been 'NativeHipHop.net' a collective effort with submissions from various artists and members of the public. Offering a wealth of website links, artist reviews and MP3 downloads ‚Äì NativeHipHop.net was, in the early days, instrumental and invaluable in networking with Indigenous North American hip hop artists and groups such as Shadowyze, Atzlan Underground, Anishinaabe Posse, Gary Davis, Manik, Natay, 7th Generation, Red Power Squad, Quese The Emcee, Night Shield, Reddnation, Rollin Fox, Supaman, King Blizz and War Party, giving them a voice online. In the five years proceeding after the Millennium Year, the website grew in popularity and acted as a 'spring-board' for many of the Native hip hop artists around today.

A form of historicist architecture, it took its inspiration from English Tudor and Gothic buildings. It has returned in the 21st century in the form of prominent new buildings at schools and universities including Princeton and Yale. Ralph Adams Cram, arguably the leading Gothic Revival architect and theoretician in the early 20th century, wrote about the appeal of the Gothic for educational facilities in his book Gothic Quest: \\"Through architecture and its allied arts we have the power to bend men and sway them as few have who depended on the spoken word. It is for us, as part of our duty as our highest privilege to act...for spreading what is true.\\"Slipek, Edwin J., Jr., Ralph Adams Cram, The University of Richmond and the Gothic Style Today, Marsh Art Gallery, University of Richmond, 1997 p. 19 History =Beginnings= Gothic Revival architecture was used for American college buildings as early as 1829, when \\"Old Kenyon\\" was completed on the campus of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.Rev. Norman Nash designed the building. Architect Charles Bullfinch was asked to review the plans, and designed the steeple. Marjorie Warvelle Harbaugh, \\"Charles Bullfinch,\\" The First Forty Years of Washington DC Architecture, (Lulu, 2013), p. 362. Another early example was Alexander Jackson Davis's University Hall (1833‚Äì37, demolished 1890), on New York University's Washington Square campus. Richard Bond's church-like library for Harvard College, Gore Hall (1837‚Äì41, demolished 1913), became the model for other library buildings.Daniel Coit Gilman, \\"The Library of Yale College,\\" The University Quarterly (October 1860), p. 9.Kenneth A. Breisch, Henry Hobson Richardson and the Small Public Library in America, (MIT Press, 1997), p. 60. James Renwick, Jr.'s Free Academy Building (1847‚Äì49, demolished 1928), for what is today City College of New York, continued in the style. Inspired by London's Hampton Court Palace, Swedish-born Charles Ulricson designed Old Main (1856‚Äì57) at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Following the Civil War, idiosyncratic High Victorian Gothic buildings were added to the campuses of American colleges, including Yale College (Farnam Hall, built in 1869‚Äì70; designed by architect Russell Sturgis); the University of Pennsylvania (College Hall, 1870‚Äì72, Thomas W. Richards); Harvard College (Memorial Hall, 1870‚Äì77, William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt); and Cornell University (Sage Hall (1871‚Äì75, Charles Babcock). In 1871, English architect William Burges designed a row of vigorous French Gothic-inspired buildings for Trinity College ‚Äì Seabury Hall, Northam Tower, Jarvis Hall (all completed 1878) ‚Äì in Hartford, Connecticut. Tastes became more conservative in the 1880s, and \\"collegiate architecture soon after came to prefer a more scholarly and less restless Gothic.\\"Lewis, The Gothic Revival, p. 185. =Movement= Cornell University, Lyon, McFaddin and War Memorial (1928), Charles Klauder Beginning in the late-1880s, Philadelphia architects Walter Cope and John Stewardson expanded the campus of Bryn Mawr College in an understated English Gothic style that was highly sensitive to site and materials. Inspired by the architecture of Oxford and Cambridge universities, and historicists but not literal copyists, Cope & Stewardson were highly influential in establishing the Collegiate Gothic style. Commissions followed for collections of buildings at the University of Pennsylvania (1895‚Äì1911), Princeton University (1896‚Äì1902), and Washington University in St. Louis (1899‚Äì1909), marking the nascent beginnings of a movement that transformed many college campuses across the country. In 1901, the firm of Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge created a master plan for a Collegiate Gothic campus for the fledgling University of Chicago, then spent the next 15 years completing it. Some of their works, such as the Mitchell Tower (1901‚Äì1908), were near-literal copies of historic buildings. George Browne Post designed the City College of New York's new campus (1903‚Äì1907) at Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, in the style. The style was experienced up-close by a wide audience at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. The World's Fair and 1904 Olympic Games were held on the newly completed campus of Washington University, which delayed occupying its buildings until 1905. The movement gained further momentum when Charles Donagh Maginnis designed Gasson Hall at Boston College in 1908. Maginnis & Walsh went on to design Collegiate Gothic buildings at some twenty-five other campuses, including the main buildings at Emmanuel College (Massachusetts), and the law school at the University of Notre Dame. Ralph Adams Cram designed one of the most poetic collections of Collegiate Gothic buildings for the Princeton University Graduate College (1911‚Äì1917). James Gamble Rogers did extensive work at Yale University, beginning in 1917. Some critics claim he took historicist fantasy to an extreme, while others choose to focus on what is widely considered to be the resulting beautiful and sophisticated Yale campus.Paul Goldberger, \\"Architecture and New Haven\\", International Festival of Arts and Ideas, New Haven, June 24th, 2010 http://www.paulgoldberger.com/lectures/architecture-and-new-haven/ Rogers was criticized by the growing Modernist movement.Paul Goldberger, \\"The Sterling Library: A Reassessment\\", On the Rise: Architecture and Design in a Post Modern Age, (Penguin Books, 1985), pp. 269‚Äì71. His cathedral-like Sterling Memorial Library (1927‚Äì1930), with its ecclesiastical imagery and lavish use of ornament, came under vocal attack from one of Yale's own undergraduates: > A modern building constructed for purely modern needs has no excuse for > going off in an orgy of meretricious medievalism and stale > iconography.William Harlan Hale, \\"Yale's Cathedral Orgy\\", The Nation (April > 29, 1931), pp. 471‚Äì72. Other architects, notably John Russell Pope and Bertram Goodhue (who just before his death sketched the original version of Yale's Sterling Library from which Rogers worked), advocated for and contributed to Yale's particular version of Collegiate Gothic.Bloomer, Kent C. (2000). The Nature of Ornament: Rhythm and Metamorphosis in Architecture. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. pp. 187‚Äì185. . Retrieved 4 April 2014. When McMaster University moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canadian architect William Lyon Somerville designed its new campus (1928‚Äì1930) in the style. =Origins of the term= American architect Alexander Jackson Davis is \\"generally credited with coining the term\\" documented in a handwritten description of his own \\"English Collegiate Gothic Mansion\\" of 1853 for the Harrals of Bridgeport, Connecticut. By the 1890s, the movement was known as \\"Collegiate Gothic\\". =1904 commentary= In his praise for Cope & Stewardson's Quadrangle Dormitories at the University of Pennsylvania, architect Ralph Adams Cram revealed some of the racial and cultural implications underlying the Collegiate Gothic: =Culmination= The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning Collegiate Gothic complexes were most often horizontal compositions, save for a single tower or towers serving as an exclamation. At the University of Pittsburgh, Charles Klauder was commissioned by University of Pittsburgh chancellor John Gabbert Bowman to design a tall building in the form of a Gothic tower. What he produced, the Cathedral of Learning (1926‚Äì37), has been described as the literal culmination of late Gothic Revival architecture. A combination of Gothic spire and modern skyscraper, the steel-frame, limestone-clad, 42-story structure is both the world's second tallest university building and Gothic-styled edifice. The tower contain a half-acre Gothic hall supported only by its 52-foot (16 m) tall arches. It is accompanied by the campus's other Gothic Revival structures by Klauder, including the Stephen Foster Memorial (1935‚Äì1937) and the French Gothic Heinz Memorial Chapel (1933‚Äì1938). =21st-century revival= A number of colleges and universities have commissioned major new buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style in recent years. These include Princeton University's Whitman College (Porphyrios Associates, 2007),and Benjamin Franklin College and Pauli Murray College (Robert A.M. Stern Architects, 2017) at Yale University. The University of Southern California's USC Village was created as an inexpensive post-modern nod to collegiate revival. (Harley Ellis Devereaux, 2017).

Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian Identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both English and French. While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians' shared history and geopolitical situation in North America and the world. Though neither universally kind nor moderate, humorous Canadian literature has often been branded by author Dick Bourgeois-Doyle as \\"gentle satire,\\" evoking the notion embedded in humorist Stephen Leacock's definition of humour as \\"the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof.\\"Bourgeois-Doyle, Dick, What's So Funny?: Lessons from Canada's Leacock Medal for Humour Writing. General Store Publishing House, 2015. . p.57 The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One thread is the portrayal of a \\"typical\\" Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television series. Examples include La famille Plouffe, with its mix of drama, humour, politics and religion and sitcoms such as King of Kensington and La Petite Vie. Another major thread tends to be political and cultural satire: television shows such as CODCO, Royal Canadian Air Farce, La Fin du monde est √† 7 heures and This Hour Has 22 Minutes, monologuists such as Yvon Deschamps and Rick Mercer and writers, including Michel Tremblay, Will Ferguson and Eric Nicol draw their material from Canadian and Qu√©b√©cois society and politics. Other comedians portray absurdity; these include the television series The Kids in the Hall and The Frantics, and musician-comedians such as The Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue. Elements of satire are to be found throughout Canadian humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences. As with other countries, humour at the expense of regional and ethnic stereotypes can be found in Canada. Examples are 'Newfie' jokes (with 'Newfie' being a colloquial term for a person from the island of Newfoundland) and jokes revolving around English-speaking Canadians' stereotype of French Canadians, and vice versa. Humber College in Toronto and the √âcole nationale de l'humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programs in comedy writing and performance. Montreal is also home to the bilingual (English and French) Just for Laughs festival and to the Just for Laughs museum, a bilingual, international museum of comedy. Literature According to author Stephen Scobie, Canadian humorous writing has tended more towards prose than poetry.Scobie, Stephen \\"Humorous Writing in English\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on: March 24, 2008. An early work of Canadian humour, Thomas McCulloch's Letters of Mephibosheth Stepsure (1821‚Äì23) appeared in the Halifax weekly Acadian Recorder. Northrop Frye described McCulloch's satirical letters as \\"quiet, observant, deeply conservative in a human sense\\"; he asserted that McCulloch's persona, the \\"conventional, old-fashioned, homespun\\" farmer, was an extension of a centuries-old satiric tradition, and that the letters set the tone for later comedic writing in Canada. Compared to McCulloch's dry and understated style, Thomas Chandler Haliburton showed the same conservative social values in the brash, overstated character of Sam Slick, the Yankee Clockmaker. Haliburton's Sam Slick persona in The Clockmaker (1836), as Arthur Scobie notes in The Canadian Encyclopedia, \\"proved immensely popular and, ironically, has influenced American humour as much as Canadian.\\" Authors responded with folk humour and satire to the domination of 19th-century French Canadian culture by the Catholic Church. Napol√©on Aubin satirized Quebec public life in his journals Le Fantasque (1837‚Äì45) and Le Castor (1843), and through his theatre troupe, Les Amateurs typographiques, established in 1839. He was imprisoned during that same year for his views. This cosmopolitan tradition is also seen in the journalism of Arthur Buies, editor of La Lanterne canadienne (1868‚Äì69), a highly satirical journal of that era.Lacombe, Michelle \\"Humorous Writing in French\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on: March 24, 2008. Light comedy that mocked local customs was typical of 19th-century theatre in Quebec. Examples include Joseph Quesnel's L'Anglomanie, ou le d√Æner √† l'angloise (1803), which criticized the imitation of English customs, and Pierre Petitclair's Une partie de campagne (1865). More serious dramas attacked specific targets: the anonymous Les Com√©dies du status quo (1834) ridiculed local politics, and Le D√©fricheteur de langue (1859) by Isodore Mesplats, (pseudonym of Joseph LaRue and Joseph-Charles Tach√©), mocked Parisian manners. Other examples of theatrical satire were F√©lix-Gabriel Marchand's comedy, Les faux brillants (1885) and Louvigny de Montigny's Les Boules de neige (1903), which took aim at Montreal's bourgeoisie. Humorous magazines in French included La Gu√™pe, \\"journal qui pique\\", published in Montreal 1857-1861. By the early 20th century, the satirical tradition was well developed in English Canada as exemplified in the writing of Stephen Leacock. In Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (1912), Leacock, already known for his satirical wit, used tragic irony and astute insight in examining day-to-day, small-town life. The book remains a classic of Canadian literature, and was followed by Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich in 1914. An annual Canadian literary award, the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, is named in his memory. The award is presented to the year's best work of humorous literature by a Canadian. Donald Jack, three-time winner of the Leacock Medal, wrote a number of comedies for the stage, radio, and television, but is best known for his nine- part series of novels about aviator Bartholomew Bandy. Following the R√©volution tranquille in Quebec, theatrical satire reappeared in 1968 with Michel Tremblay's play Les Belles s≈ìurs, written in Qu√©b√©cois joual. The controversial play picked apart the myth of a stable bourgeois Quebec society with a mix of realistic comedy and allegorical satire. Following Tremblay's lead, Jean Barbeau exposed Quebec popular culture in La Coupe stainless (1974). Tremblay and Barbeau set the stage for reviews such as Broue (1979), a collective production, which toured English-speaking Canada as Brew (1982). Humorous fiction in French Canada draws from the oral tradition of folk songs and folktales which were the common coin of humour in the 19th century. Only a few of these folk tales surfaced in writing prior to the 20th century. However, contemporary writers such as Jacques Ferron (Contes du pays incertain, 1962) in Quebec and Antonine Maillet in Acadian New Brunswick (La Sagouine, 1974, and P√©lagie-la-Charette, 1979), rely extensively on folk humour and popular culture. Other Quebec writers noted for their humour include Roger Lemelin, G√©rard Bessette, Jacques Godbout, Roch Carrier and Yves Beauchemin. Beauchemin's picaresque novel Le Matou (1981) is the all-time best-selling novel in Quebec literature. The plain talking alter-ego as an instrument of satire continued with Robertson Davies' series of Samuel Marchbanks books (1947‚Äì67) and John Metcalf's James Wells in General Ludd (1980). Davies is one of many Canadian writers of \\"serious\\" literature who were also known for humour in their work. Margaret Atwood, Farley Mowat, Paul Quarrington, Mordecai Richler, Raymond Fraser, Carol Shields, W. O. Mitchell, Ray Guy, Pierre Berton, M.A.C. Farrant and Miriam Toews are all well-known writers of mainstream literature who have also been acknowledged for using humour and wit in their writing. Many other writers of Canadian humour have been published as newspaper or magazine commentators, including Gary Lautens, Richard J. Needham, Eric Nicol, Joey Slinger, Will Ferguson, Marsha Boulton and Linwood Barclay. Humour is also central to the work of Canadian children's writers such as Gordon Korman, Dennis Lee and Robert Munsch. Music Particularly in recent years, Canada has produced a number of musical groups who have been described as \\"comedy rock\\". Bands such as Barenaked Ladies, Odds, Crash Test Dummies, The Awkward Stage and Rheostatics are sometimes misunderstood as being strictly novelty bands, but in fact many of their songs use humour to illuminate more serious themes. A number of other acts, such as Corky and the Juice Pigs, Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue write specifically comedic songs. Nancy White is a noted Canadian musical satirist, whose comedic folk songs about Canadian culture and politics have regularly appeared on CBC Radio programs. In addition to more serious material on his primary albums, folk musician Geoff Berner ‚Äî who has also run for political office as a candidate of the Rhinoceros Party ‚Äî frequently releases pointedly satirical songs, such as \\"Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)\\", as free downloads from his website. Don Ast, a stand-up comedian who performed in character as befuddled Ukrainian immigrant Nestor Pistor, had his greatest popular success with an album in which he sang country songs in character as Pistor.\\"Nestor Pistor, Winestoned Plowboy\\". Ontario Library Review, Volumes 62-63 (1978). p. 51 His single \\"Winestoned Plowboy\\", a parody of Glen Campbell's \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\", was a hit on Canada's country music charts in 1977;\\"RPM Country Playlist\\". RPM, February 12, 1977. Pistor returned to more conventional standup comedy thereafter, but received three Juno Award nominations for Comedy Album of the Year in the next three years. Jann Arden, a singer-songwriter renowned for writing sad love songs, is also paradoxically known as one of Canada's funniest live performers, whose witty, unpretentious stage patter about herself and her family is as much a part of her relationship with her audience as her music is. Hip hop musician Shad is also known for using comedy and humour in his music; for one of his most successful singles to date, \\"The Old Prince Still Lives at Home\\", he filmed a video in which he essentially played Will Smith in a parody of the opening credits to The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Another noted Canadian musical comedian is Mary Lou Fallis, an opera singer who performs both in classical opera roles and as the comedic character \\"Primadonna\\", a touring stage show in which she parodies popular stereotypes of opera divas. Canadian heavy metal frontman Devin Townsend is known for using humour in his music. Projects such as Punky Bruster and Ziltoid the Omniscient are heavily comedy driven, and Devin's heavy metal band, Strapping Young Lad, use satire and sarcastic tongue in cheek lyrics as well. Radio Many of Canada's comedy acts and performers have started out on radio, primarily on the national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) network. While individual comedy show and segments have been around almost as long as the network, the focus has tended be more on specific shows featuring particular groups of comedians. The real beginnings of Canadian radio comedy began in the late 1930s with the debut of The Happy Gang, a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes. It debuted in 1938 and ran until 1959. The Wayne & Shuster show debuted on CBC radio in 1946, their more literate and classy humour regularly appearing on the airwaves well into the early 1960s. Max Ferguson's long-running shows After Breakfast Breakdown and the Max Ferguson Show featured short satirical skits based on current events, with a variety of characters voiced by Ferguson. The Royal Canadian Air Farce started as a radio show debuting in 1973 featuring mainly political and some character-based comedy sketches. It ran for 24 years before making a permanent transition to television. It started a tradition of topical and politically satirical radio shows that inspired such programs as Double Exposure, The Muckraker and What a Week. A zanier, more surreal brand of radio comedy was unveiled in the early 1980s with the debut of The Frantics' Frantic Times radio show, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Its smart and surreal style fostered a new take on Canadian radio comedy that was followed by the likes of successor shows as The Norm, Radio Free Vestibule and The Irrelevant Show. Another enduring radio comedy program is The Vinyl Cafe, hosted by Stuart McLean. The show is centred around McLean's Dave and Morley stories, a series of narrated short stories about a Toronto family and their friends and neighbours; many of the stories have been compiled in book form, and the books have often won or been nominated for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. By the 1990s the satirical and zany elements merged into two of the more notable CBC radio comedy shows of the 1990s: The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour, a show that offered bitingly satirical pieces from a First Nations perspective mixed in with general silliness; and Great Eastern, a show set in a fictitious Newfoundland \\"national\\" radio station featuring improbable news stories, fictitious archival recordings and unlikely archeological findings played straight. CBC Radio continues to play an important part in developing comedy performers on radio. Madly Off In All Directions became a weekly national forum for regional sketch and stand-up comics, a practice that continues in the more recent series The Debaters and Laugh Out Loud. Just for Laughs Radio, a channel programmed and broadcast by SiriusXM Satellite Radio to Canada and the United States, features predominantly Canadian comedy. Television CBC Television's first Canadian- produced television series was Sunshine Sketches, an adaptation of Stephen Leacock's iconic humour book Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town. Original Canadian television comedy begins with Wayne and Shuster, a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy team during the Second World War, and moved their act to radio in 1946 before moving on to television. They became one of Canada's most enduring comedy teams on Canadian television and in the United States as well: they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show 67 times, a record for any performer. Their Julius Caesar sketch, Rinse the Blood off My Toga, with its legendary catchphrase, \\"I told him, Julie, don't go!\\", was particularly noted. Wayne and Shuster continued to appear on CBC Television until the late 1980s, with specials that mixed new sketches with their classic material. La famille Plouffe, the first regularly scheduled television drama in Canada, was produced in 1953 by Radio-Canada, in French. The program was broadcast on both English and French networks of CBC TV from 1954 to 1959, (in English as The Plouffe Family). It was a mix of drama, humour and social commentary about a working-class Quebec family in the post-World War II era. Another of the CBC's earliest productions was Sunshine Sketches, a television adaptation of one of the enduring classics of Canadian humour writing, Stephen Leacock's Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town. Another pioneer in Canadian television comedy was, oddly, a news series. This Hour Has Seven Days, which debuted in 1964, was primarily meant as a newsmagazine, but its segments included political satire as well as serious news reports. Later series such as Royal Canadian Air Farce, This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer Report have all drawn on the tradition of political satire established by Seven Days, and have been among Canadian television's most popular comedy series in recent years. Canadian born Lorne Michaels, who had moved from Toronto to Los Angeles in 1968 to work on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, launched the NBC comedy show Saturday Night Live in 1975. Over the years, several Canadians were part of the SNL cast, including Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short, and Mike Myers. Michaels also produced The Kids in the Hall for Canadian TV in the 1980s. Many Canadian comedy shows, while not directly about politics per se, have made profound political statements by satirizing society and pop culture. This includes shows such as SCTV, Buzz and CODCO. CODCO, in particular, was intensely controversial at times for its use of comedy in tackling sensitive subjects; founding member Andy Jones quit CODCO in protest after the CBC refused to air a sketch that made a very explicit political statement about the Mount Cashel Orphanage child abuse scandal. The series History Bites was ostensibly a show presenting history in a sketch comedy, but frequently used the historic setting to satirize current political events and social trends. Other shows, such as The Kids in the Hall, 4 on the Floor, Bizarre and Puppets Who Kill, revelled in absurdist humour, making household names out of characters such as Chicken Lady, Mr. Canoehead and Super Dave Osborne. Other notable sketch series have included Zut!, The Gavin Crawford Show and The Holmes Show. Canadian television also frequently showcases stand-up comedians. The popular series Comics, based around one comedian each week, has been the first national television exposure for many of Canada's current comedy stars. Another series, Just for Laughs, has for many years presented comedians appearing at the Montreal Comedy Festival. That series has also spawned the more recent Just For Laughs Gags, a practical joke show similar to Candid Camera. Although several notable Canadian sitcoms have been produced, such as Excuse My French, King of Kensington, Hangin' In, Corner Gas, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Kim's Convenience, and Schitt's Creek, many other sitcoms, including Material World, Mosquito Lake, Snow Job, Check it Out!, The Trouble with Tracy, Rideau Hall and Not My Department, have generally fared poorly with critics and audiences. Critic Geoff Pevere has pointed out, however, that American television has produced a lot of bad sitcoms as well. The difference, according to Pevere, is that the economics of television production in Canada mean that whereas an unpopular American sitcom may be cancelled and largely forgotten after just a few weeks, Canadian television networks can rarely afford to lose their investment ‚Äî meaning that a Canadian sitcom almost always airs every episode that was produced, regardless of its performance in the ratings. On the other hand, Canadian television comedy fares much better when it breaks the sitcom form, especially with dramedy. Unconventional comedy series such as The Beachcombers, Due South, Made in Canada, Kenny vs. Spenny, Chilly Beach, The Newsroom, Primetime Glick, The Red Green Show, La Petite Vie, Seeing Things, Trailer Park Boys, Supertown Challenge, Les Bougon and Twitch City have been much more successful than most of Canada's conventional sitcoms, both in Canada and as international exports. Canada has a national television channel, The Comedy Network, devoted to comedy. Its programming includes some of the classic Canadian comedy series noted above, repeats of several hit American and British series such as The Simpsons, South Park and Absolutely Fabulous, and original series such as Kevin Spencer, Odd Job Jack, The Devil's Advocates, Improv Heaven and Hell and Puppets Who Kill. Rick Mercer began his career in 1990 with a touring one-man show, Show Me the Button, I'll Push It, about Canadian life in the immediate aftermath of the failed Meech Lake Accord. That show was a sellout success; in 1993, he made his television debut as one of the writers and performers on This Hour Has 22 Minutes. Mercer's \\"rants\\", short op-ed pieces on Canadian politics and culture, quickly became the show's signature segment. When he published a collection of rants in 1998 as Streeters, the book quickly became a bestseller. Mercer left 22 Minutes in 2000 to devote more time to his other series, Made in Canada. When that series ended its run, he launched the new Rick Mercer Report. Another famous comedic export in the same era was Tom Green, whose surreal and sometimes grotesque humour on The Tom Green Show began as a community cable show in Ottawa before becoming a hit on MTV. As with many other genres, Canadian television comedy also frequently plays with the topic of Canada's relationship with the United States. Mercer turned another 22 Minutes segment, Talking to Americans, into a 2001 television special, which was a ratings smash. In Talking to Americans, Mercer, in his 22 Minutes guise as reporter \\"J.B. Dixon\\", visited American cities to ask people on the street for their opinion on a Canadian news story ‚Äî the joke for Canadians was that the news story was always fabricated, and either inherently ridiculous (e.g. a border dispute between Quebec and Chechnya or an annual Toronto polar bear hunt) or blatantly out of context (e.g. wishing Canadians a \\"Happy Stockwell Day\\".) Another notable show, the sitcom An American in Canada, reversed that formula, finding comedy in the culture shock of an American television reporter taking a job with a Canadian TV station. Tom Green once played with this staple of Canadian comedy as well, during a controversial segment in which he burned a Canadian flag. Web In the same vein as Air Farce and 22 Minutes, a number of notable web sites have emerged to publish articles that either satirize real events or wholly invent stories that lampoon aspects of Canadian culture. Frank magazine, which originated as a printed publication, has been joined in recent years by The Beaverton, The Daily Bonnet, and Walking Eagle News modelled after The Onion. Comedy clubs Notable Canadian comedy clubs and showcases include The Second City branch in Toronto (originally housed at The Old Fire Hall), the Yuk Yuk's chain, and The ALTdot COMedy Lounge. The top clubs in Canada are Rumor's Comedy Club in Winnipeg, The Comic Strip in Edmonton, The Comedy Mix in Vancouver, and Absolute Comedy in Toronto. The Canadian Comedy Awards The Canadian Comedy Awards were founded by Tim Progosh and Higher Ground Productions in 1999. Over the past eight years they have given out more than 160 awards in three categories - live comedy, film and television.

It defines a realm like the one that contains the observable universe as only one of many inflationary zones.\\"A New Theory of Cosmic Origins\\" by I. M. Oderberg (review of \\"The Inflationary Universe\\" by Alan H.

In his 2012 journal, Lehners wrote about how pocket universes can emerge as a result of eternal inflation. The mechanisms of inflation within these pocket universes could function in a variety of manner, such as slow- roll inflation, undergoing cycles of cosmological evolution, or resembling of the Galilean genesis or other 'emergent' universe scenarios. Lehners goes on to discuss which one of these types of universes we live in, and how that is dependent on the measurement of the regulation of infinities inherent in eternal inflation. But, Lehners continues, \\"the current leading measure proposals--namely, the global light-cone cutoff and its local counterpart, the causal diamond measure--as well as closely related proposals, all predict that we should live in a pocket universe that starts out with a small Hubble rate, thus favoring emergent and cyclic models.\\" Lehners adds, \\"Pocket universes which undergo cycles are further preferred, because they produce habitable conditions repeatedly inside each pocket.\\" References Category:Inflation (cosmology) ","title":"Pocket universe"},{"id":"1257861","text":"Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a recreational drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, although there have been at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.  History  = Development history = It is often claimed that BZP was originally synthesized as a potential antihelminthic (anti-parasitic) agent for use in farm animals. However, there are some references to BZP in medical literature that predate interest in piperazines as antihelminthics. Even so, the majority of the early work with the piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics with the earliest clinical trials in the literature relating to piperazine being articles in the British Medical Journal in the 1950s. It was discovered that BZP had side effects and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment. It next appears in the literature in the 1970s when it was investigated as a potential antidepressant medication, but rejected when research reported that BZP had amphetamine-like effects and was liable to abuse. The study suggested that BZP \\"should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating the use of amphetamine\\". = Recreational history = In the early 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted the drug was being used recreationally in California. It also reported that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, there was an explosion in the drug's use worldwide ‚Äì a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007. Piperazine-based stimulants began to appear in Europe in 2000 but remained virtually unavailable in the rest of the world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and TFMPP began to appear in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.  Production and distribution  A selection of products containing BZP. BZP is a piperazine derivative which comes as either the hydrochloride salt or a free base. The hydrochloride salt is a white solid while the base form is a slightly yellowish-green liquid. BZP base is corrosive and causes burns. In countries where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw materials can be purchased from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques. The resulting product can be marketed at extremely high markup, so end-user prices can be as high as 300 times the bulk cost of raw ingredients. BZP is often marketed ostensibly as a \\"dietary supplement\\" to avoid meeting stricter laws that apply to medicines and drugs, despite the fact that BZP has no dietary value. As of late 2005, the Misuse of Drugs Act ensured it can no longer be classified or marketed as a dietary supplement in New Zealand. Some retailers claim that BZP is a \\"natural\\" product, describing it as a \\"pepper extract\\" or \\"herbal high,\\" when in fact the drug is entirely synthetic, and has not been found to occur naturally.  Pharmacodynamics  BZP has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline. BZP also acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist on a wide variety of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.  Effects  Typical pupil dilation The effects of BZP are largely similar to amphetamines, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. A 2005 study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA. = Subjective effects = Upon ingestion of between 50 mg and 200 mg of BZP, the user may experience any or all of the following: Initial Effects: * Feelings of euphoria, wonder, amazement, well-being, energy and elation * Rapid mood elevation * Enhanced sociability * Enhanced appreciation of music * Increased desire to move, also slight increase in stereotypy * Skin tingling * Decreased appetite * Repetitive thought patterns * Actual and perceived changes in body temperature * Mild jaw clenching/bruxism * Increased heart rate * Dilation of pupils (see photo) * Nausea * Flushing * Mild xerostomia (dry mouth) * Slight urinary incontinence, often described as \\"leaking\\" a small amount of urine after urinating (not due to loss of bladder control) Later Effects: * Mild headache * Nausea * Hangover-like symptoms (common with high doses) * Fatigue * Indigestion (similar to acid indigestion/heartburn) * Increased hunger (and sometimes thirst) * Insomnia * Confusion * Depression (particularly with frequent/heavy use) = Tolerance = Research into BZP's tolerance is sparse. Anecdotal evidence from online sources claim tolerance to the central action of BZP will develop quickly. Due to tiredness associated with the body's recovery from stimulants, such as BZP, it is uncommon for users to be able to sustain a week-long intake. = Toxic effects = ecstasy' tablet ‚Äì seized by law enforcement in the United States ‚Äì containing BZP, methamphetamine, and caffeine As with most sympathomimetic stimulants there appear to be significant side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe hangover after the drug effect wears off, however, some manufacturers in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain 5-HTP and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers. The major side effects include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or as part of a medicolegal death investigation.  Christchurch study  The majority of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related to the use of benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs. = Risk of fatality = A retrospective study carried out at an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case of a combination of BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death. Rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort to prevent him from dying. He later recovered. In a case in Zurich in 2001 a 23-year-old who had taken BZP and ecstasy (MDMA) died from a massive cerebral edema 57 hours after hospital admission. = Addictive effects = One in every 45 (2.2%) last-year users of BZP in New Zealand is classed as dependent upon it, although 97.9% of users said that \\"it would not be difficult to stop using legal party pills\\", and 45.2% of people who reported using both BZP and illegal drugs such as methamphetamine reported that they used BZP so that they did not have to use methamphetamine, which was perceived as more harmful. Still, most of the people who use BZP, even though they say it is quite easy to stop, do not want to, and continue to use the drug, feeling that it helps them to reach higher levels of mood, sociability, and energy. Studies undertaken on animals have indicated that BZP can substitute for methamphetamine in addicted rats, although it is one-tenth as potent and produces correspondingly weaker addictive effects.  Legal issues  The drug was classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in 2002, following a report by the DEA which incorrectly stated that BZP was 10 to 20 times more potent than amphetamine, when in fact BZP is ten times less potent than dexamphetamine. BZP is banned in all Australian states. Victoria, the last state in which it was legal, changed its classification on 1 September 2006. This is the date BZP and piperazine analogs become illegal in the federal schedules which are now enacted by all Australian states and territories. BZP is also a banned substance in Japan, along with TFMPP. Both Australia and Japan admit that their scheduling decisions were made primarily in response to the Schedule 1 classification given to BZP in the US, although some instances of BZP use had been reported by law enforcement authorities in both countries. BZP is also banned in Greece, Poland, Italy, Ireland, Malta, Estonia, Denmark and Sweden. In Canada, Benzylpiperazine and salts of benzylpiperazine are classified as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Piperazine and salts of piperazine are classified as Prescription Only Medicines in the UK. Any products containing salts of piperazine would be licensable under the Medicines ActSect. 8 of Medicines Act 1968 ‚Äì Schedule 3, SI 3144 The Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc) Regulations 1994 and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold the relevant licenses to do so. BZP is not a salt of piperazine, but mislabelling of BZP products as containing \\"piperazine blend\\" resulted in some prosecutions of suppliers in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, although none were successful. In May 2009, the Home Office announced plans to ban BZP, and launched a consultation on the proposal. In October 2009, it was announced that from 23 December 2009, BZP and related piperazines would be Class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act. BZP is not controlled under any UN convention, so the compounds themselves are legal throughout most of the world, although in most countries their use is restricted to pharmaceutical manufacturing and recreational use is unknown. Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be the subject of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may determine what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about as the result of a joint Europol ‚Äì EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008. Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.

There are many different scripting languages for different types of IRC clients: ircII, BitchX, XChat, mIRC, Visual IRC, Bersirc, and others have their own scripting languages, many of which share common features and syntax and therefore are easily portable from one IRC client to another.200x150px  Basis  = Aliases = Most IRC scripts contain one or more aliases. Aliases are used to bind some command to a set of commands, or give it parameters, to save time when typing such commands over and over. For example, a simple alias might allow the user to type \\"/j channel\\" instead of \\"/join #channel\\", saving exactly 5 keystrokes (counting Shift). Aliases can add new commands, replace commands built into the IRC client, or provide abbreviations for long commands or sequences of commands. Aliases can usually be used as functions to produce a value that is used elsewhere in the script. In some cases, an alias hypo can be associated with a keyboard shortcut. = Event-based Scripting = Events, also known as remotes, allow a script to respond automatically when a particular type of message is received from the IRC server, or when a certain action is performed by the user, such as pressing a key or closing a window. Advanced event scripting usually requires knowledge of the IRC protocol, though basic events can usually be written without it. = Popups in Scripts = Scripts for graphical IRC clients may contain pop-ups, which extend or replace the menus built into the client. Many scripts contain nothing but long lists of pop-ups that send humorous or cute canned messages to the channel; many of those messages take the form of a \\"slap\\", ridiculing a victim chosen by the user.  Security concerns  Since IRC scripts are used to interface with a public network, they are a favourable target for attack. Event handling code must be careful when dealing with input received from other IRC users; a poorly written IRC script may leave the user vulnerable, allowing attackers to possibly read the user's passwords or private conversations, execute arbitrary commands in the user's IRC client, or access files on the user's hard disk. IRC Scripts downloaded from public web sites or received from other IRC users may contain backdoors or similar malicious commands. Some users prefer to write their own IRC scripts to avoid the potential problems caused by a malicious or buggy script.  Similarities to Other Programming/Scripting Languages  IRC Scripts have many of the same concepts of other scripting or programming languages, such as variables, event-based execution, modification of core components and functions. IRC Scripts look similar to modular software configuration files, such as those used for some IRC daemons such as UnrealIRCd.

He was the founder of the cities of Northfield, Minnesota and Riverside, California, where John W. North High School and the John W. North Water Treatment Plant are located and named after him. He also received a Presidential appointment to Nevada's highest court, the predecessor of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Early life and career North was born at Sand Lake, Rensselaer County, New York, January 4, 1815.John North, Minnesota Legislators Past and Present His grandparents had come to New York from Connecticut shortly after the Revolutionary War.John Wesley North and the Reform Frontier By Merlin Stonehouse page 4 He started teaching school at the age of 15 and became a licensed lay preacher in 1833. He completed his post secondary education at Cazenovia Seminary in New York and attended Wesleyan University. He later studied law and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1845. 1850 photograph of \\"John W. North home, east side of Minneapolis, at 118 University Avenue Southeast.\\" His first wife was Emma Bacon (d. 1847). In 1848, he married Ann Hendrix Loomis. He moved to the Minnesota Territory in 1849 where he continued to practice law. The first years in Minnesota were spent at St. Anthony. In the fall of 1850, North was elected a member of the second Minnesota Territorial Legislature of the territory. He ran for reelection in the 1851 elections but was defeated. He was one of the founders of the Republican Party of Minnesota in 1855. In 1857, he was a member of the Minnesota state Constitutional Convention. In 1860, he was a delegate to the Chicago Republican Convention which nominated Abraham Lincoln for the presidency of the United States and was a member of the committee that went to Springfield to notify Lincoln of his nomination. In addition to his legislative career in Minnesota, North was influential in founding the University of Minnesota, wrote the act which became the University's charter and was treasurer of its board of regents (an appointed position) from 1851‚Äì60. Founding Northfield, Minnesota On August 17, 1855, North purchased of land from three farmers: Daniel Kuykendahl, Daniel Turner, and Herman Jenkins. The entire tract of was platted in the fall of 1855, and the plat of the Original Town, comprising most of what is now the First and Second wards and a small tract across the river south of the section line now marked by Fourth street, was filed in the office of the register of deeds March 7, 1856. The town was named Northfield, Minnesota. In the summer of 1855 North started work on the dam and a $4,000 saw mill which began sawing lumber about the first of December of that year. Ann Loomis North North‚Äôs wife, Ann Loomis North, and three children aged four months to four years, joined him in Northfield in on January 3, 1856. A fourth child, John Greenleaf North (b. October 11, 1856 in Saint Anthony, Minnesota), was born later that year. The Norths eventually had six children. The Norths founded many of the early societies in Northfield. A college-bred man, John was keenly interested in the organization of the Lyceum Society, which was formed October 1, 1856, and of which he was the first president. A number of the early Northfield settlers had known the Norths in Syracuse, New York, including Ann's brother and sister-in-law, George (1835‚Äì1894) and Kate A. Loomis. When North suffered financial failure in the Panic of 1857, his business interests were purchased in 1859 by his friend Charles Augustus Wheaton, who had moved to Northfield from Syracuse on the advice of the Norths after the death of Wheaton's first wife. North's connection to the community he founded lasted only about six years. He left well before the event that brought the town its most notoriety‚Äîthe James-Younger Gang's attempt to rob the First National Bank of Northfield in 1876. Nevada Judiciary In 1861 President Abraham Lincoln appointed North the official surveyor of the new Territory of Nevada, and North moved to Virginia City, Nevada. The territorial surveyor was a sensitive position in a mining region such as Nevada‚Äôs Comstock Lode, where the boundaries of mining claims were the constant subject of lawsuits. Lincoln may have counted on North to keep Nevada Territory loyal to the Union, and to bring Nevada in as a Republican state, as he had Minnesota.Merlin Stonehouse (1965) John Wesley North and the Reform Frontier, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, pp. 133-135. North surveyed, invested in silver mining properties, began building an ore-treatment mill he named the Minnesota Mill, and practiced law. In early 1863, when Justice Gordon Mott's resignation from the Supreme Court of Nevada Territory was a certainty, Judge Horatio M. Jones recommended North for the vacancy. On August 20, 1863, Lincoln granted North a temporary appointment to Nevada's highest court, the predecessor of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Initially, North won praise both for his decisions and for removing the backlog of cases on his docket.http://www.onlinenevada.org/john_wesley_northJames W. Hulse (1988), Making law in the Great Basin: the evolution of the federal court in Nevada, 1855‚Äì1905, Western Legal History, v. 1, n. 2, pp. 135‚Äì162. He was also elected president of the 1863 constitutional convention (in Carson City) assigned to draft a proposed state constitution for Nevada. In both positions he clashed with William M. Stewart, a prominent lawyer with political ambitions and large mining companies as clients. North‚Äôs rulings supported the \\"many-ledge\\" interpretation of mining law on the Comstock Lode, which favored the smaller mining companies over the larger companies that were Stewart‚Äôs clients. Stewart accused North of accepting bribes from litigants. North denied the charge, and Stewart was forced to publicly recant, but Stewart continued to attack North‚Äôs honesty, and orchestrated a campaign against North in the Nevada newspapers allied with Stewart. Other newspapers supported North. North resigned because of ill health after less than a year on the bench, but sued Stewart for slander. North agreed to submit his suit to arbitration, and after hearing both sides, the court declared that Stewart had indeed slandered North, and that there was no evidence that North had engaged in corruption. Nevertheless, North left the Territory for California, and Stewart remained and became the U.S. Senator from the new state of Nevada.David A. Johnson (1983) The courts and the Comstock Lode: the travail of John Wesley North, Pacific Historian, v. 27, n. 2, pp. 31‚Äì46. Founding Riverside, California North and his family moved to the northern California town of Santa Clara, and then for a while to Tennessee. There are reports that North, an abolitionist, was shunned in Tennessee after he talked a crowd out of lynching a black man. This precipitated a move in 1870 back to California where, in 1870, North founded the southern California town of Riverside along with associates‚Äîsome from Minnesota‚Äîwho joined him there. In 1879, he and his family moved north to San Francisco and joined a law firm. That year, North was nominated, but did not win, the Republican nomination to the California Supreme Court. In 1880, he became the general agent for the Washington Irrigated Colony, near Fresno, California. He opened a law office in Fresno, built a house and started a farm in nearby small community of Oleander. His wife did not join him in this move.

It was released on November 15, 2005 in North America, November 18 in the PAL region, and November 23 in Japan. It is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series as well as later ones like Sonic Advance. Levels in the game are side-scrolling and displayed using both of the DS's screens. However, boss battles, the main characters, and a special stage are rendered in 3D, creating a 2.5D effect. The game's storyline follows the intertwining adventures of a new character, Blaze the Cat, and the series' main character, Sonic the Hedgehog. They respectively battle Doctor Eggman and his doppelg√§nger Eggman Nega at certain points. The game was announced under the working title Sonic DS at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, and under Sonic Rush at E3 2005. The game's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Upon release, Sonic Rush was well-received by critics, with praise stemming from the game's music and similarity to older games in the series and criticism stemming from its overall quickness. A sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure, was released in 2007. Gameplay Blaze runs through a loop in an early level of the game, demonstrating the dual-screen feature. Sonic Rush is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series as well as later ones like Sonic Advance and Sonic Mania. The player controls either Sonic the Hedgehog or Blaze the Cat, who differ in terms of special abilities. In the tradition of past Sonic games, gameplay consists of moving quickly through levels, collecting rings and defeating enemies. The player collects rings as a form of health; when they are attacked by an enemy, their rings bounce in all directions. If they are hit by an enemy and have no rings, they lose a life. A life is also lost if the character is crushed, drowns, falls into a bottomless pit, or exceeds an act 10-minute limit. Both of the DS's screens are used to display the play area, with the player's character moving between them as necessary. Levels in the game are divided into \\"zones\\", each consisting of two acts of normal gameplay then a 3D boss battle. The course of the game differs depending on whether Sonic or Blaze is chosen; the seven zones are the same, but are accessed in different orders. During boss battles, Blaze fights Doctor Eggman and Sonic fights an Eggman doppelg√§nger called Eggman Nega. As the characters' stories progress, they meet each other several times and unite in the final zone that comes after the seventh. The game features special stages the player can access via certain handles in order to obtain the Chaos Emeralds. These Special Stages resemble those of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and use the DS' stylus controls. New features include a grading system that grades the player based on the time it takes for them to complete the level; they can return to levels later to try for a higher grade. There is a point system based on the one in Sonic Advance 2 but displaying points in multiple categories. Sonic Rush introduces a \\"Tension Gauge\\" on the left side of the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies. The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving; defeating enemies, moving through the level more quickly which results in more points and a higher grade, and when playing as Sonic, accessing the special stage. Although the game is primarily two-dimensional, there are three-dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect. For the first time in the series, Sonic and Blaze's sprites are rendered in 3D. The game has a two-player mode in which Sonic and Blaze race to the end of a chosen level from the game. There is also a feature in which players who own the game can send a demo of the game to other Nintendo DS users. Plot 3D. Blaze the Cat is somehow pulled from her native dimension into Sonic's world. Her world had seven Sol Emeralds‚Äîsimilar to the Chaos Emeralds‚Äîbut they were stolen by Doctor Eggman. She then makes it her goal to retrieve them. While searching, she meets Cream the Rabbit and is surprised by her politeness. Meanwhile, Sonic is searching for the Chaos Emeralds, which have been stolen by Doctor Eggman Nega, Eggman's alternate counterpart from Blaze's dimension. Sonic briefly encounters Blaze during his search, but she departs before he can question her. His friend Tails learns that the two dimensions are merging somehow, and both will collapse if the process is not stopped. Suspicious of Blaze, Sonic and Tails begin searching for her. Upon finding Blaze and Cream, Sonic questions Blaze about her nature, but she refuses to give any information and leaves with Cream. Sonic follows her to Eggman Nega's base, where it is revealed that Eggman and Eggman Nega are working together to collect both the Chaos Emeralds and the Sol Emeralds. Blaze declares that she is the only one who can save their worlds, without anyone's help. Sonic and Blaze fight each other, until Sonic wins the fight and Blaze realizes the error of her ways. After Eggman kidnaps Cream, Blaze goes after him while Sonic takes on Nega. Sonic collects the last of the seven Chaos Emeralds and catches up with Blaze, who fails to prevent Eggman and Eggman Nega from draining the Sol Emeralds's power for their Egg Salamander mech. As the world begins to destabilize, Sonic and his friends help Blaze realize the meaning of friendship. This restores the Sol Emeralds, and Sonic and Blaze use both sets of Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic and Burning Blaze. The two destroy the Egg Salamander, restoring the dimensions to normal, and Blaze returns to her world, now better understanding her powers. Cream is saddened by Blaze's departure, but Sonic assures her that Blaze promised to return someday. Development Early concept art of Blaze the Cat Sonic Rush was developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, and published by Sega. Yuji Naka, Sega's executive managing director, announced the game at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, along with Project Rub. A demo of the newly titled Sonic Rush was featured at E3 2005, and won video game publication IGN's \\"Biggest Surprise\\" award. Blaze the Cat, a new character, was revealed at Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2005. The game's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Director Akinori Nishiyama stated in a September 2005 interview with GameSpot that Sonic Team \\"wanted to keep the elements from 2D, yet still explore some of the new elements from 3D.\\" At TGS 2005, he stated that while working on Sonic Advance 3, he realized that the series was becoming more complicated, opting for a \\"fast, dynamic action\\" approach to the next title in the series. The music was primarily composed by Hideki Naganuma of Jet Set Radio fame. Additional music was composed by the game's sound director Teruhiko Nakagawa, along with Masayoshi Ishi and Hiroyuki Hamada of T's Music. Composing the music was a challenge for Naganuma, who had to work under the limitations of the Nintendo DS' sound chip. Sonic Rush introduced Blaze, who has become a recurring character in the series. Blaze appeared for the second time in Sonic the Hedgehog in 2006, and then in Sonic Rush Adventure, the sequel to Sonic Rush, and numerous other games. Reception Sonic Rush was released on November 15, 2005 in North America; November 18 in Europe; and November 23 in Japan. It was the ninth best-selling DS game of December 2006. It sold 360,000 copies in Europe from March 2006 to March 2007. The game received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game was released to \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game for its usage of elements from older Sonic games. GameSpot, IGN, and Nintendo Power compared the game to older games in the series, specifically those on the Sega Genesis. GameSpy staff writer Greg Sewart offered a similar opinion, also praising the game for its \\"gorgeous graphics\\". The game's overall quickness was not as well received. GameSpy's Greg Sewart, although giving a mostly positive review, complained that \\"it's so fast you almost can't tell what's going on most of the time.\\" 1UP.com and GamePro thought similarly. The game's music was well-received, called \\"bright [and] buoyant\\" by 1UP.com and compared to that of Jet Set Radio by GameSpot. GameSpy called the music \\"all very fitting and very catchy\\", noting its use of sampling and unconventional structure. In 2008, Sonic Rush was listed at #17 in IGN's list of the top 25 DS games. In 2009, it was listed as one of the \\"cheers\\" on IGN's \\"Cheers & Tears\\" list of action games for the DS.

The main character of both games, bounty hunter Jake Stone, takes on a series of missions that has him shipping cargo and fending off attackers. The story is told through simple conversations and brief cutscenes. In some ways, the series is reminiscent of Star Control II, without the ship customization and fleet building aspects. Gameplay A typical game in progress. To the right are the radar (showing the player's co-ordinates) and the weapons configuration subpanel Gameplay is presented in a top-down view. The focus is always on Stone's ship. The keyboard or a joystick is used to navigate the ship and fire weapons (which consist of lasers and missiles). Mice are also supported. Many functions, such as scans, communication, and power distribution, are controlled by the control panel. The player can zoom out to see details, the amount of which depends on how much power is allocated to sensors. Power is allocated to various ship's systems, such as shields, weapons, life support, engines, and is consumed by the hyperdrive, whose maximum speed is determined by engine power allocation. Hull integrity is shown through a square superimposed on top of the ship. Over time, the ship will repair itself, the speed of which depending on how much power has been dedicated to the life support systems. The waveforms of shields and weapons can be adjusted. The specific waveform selected for a laser blast or shield configuration dictates their effectiveness against each other. Lasers can be set to fire for either one, two, or three laser cannons firing simultaneously. Communication is implemented in the form of the other party talking and the player selecting a response. Items in the player's cargo hold can be transported to planets and other ships. In the first episode, many missions involve delivering cargo in return for useful items. Plot In The Escape, humans live in a planetary system millions of light years from Earth. Space travel is common, but hyperdrive research is restricted: any research pertaining to hyperdrive travel is destroyed by the oppressive solar government. However, one group has spent a decade in secret developing a hyperdrive ship and plans to use it to escape the force field encasing their planetary system. The government hires Stone to stop them. It is eventually revealed that the solar government is conspiring with a race of superior aliens to stop the development of hyperdrive technology. These aliens keep species for study, and push these species toward war. Travel to other planetary systems is barred by invisible force fields around the systems. The aliens and their agents travel by means of fixed, self-made portals, opened with special keys. Ultimately, Stone is able to travel through one of the portals where he is greeted by an alien agitator, who seeks his assistance to bring to an end the cruel treatment of these species.

It is also used to prevent cytomegalovirus following a kidney transplant in high risk cases. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache and vomiting. Severe side effects may include kidney problems. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is a prodrug, which works after being converted to aciclovir in a person's body. Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£3 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$2.80. In 2017, it was the 152nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses Valtrex brand valaciclovir 500mg tablets Valaciclovir is used for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections, including:Rossi S, editor. Australian Medicines Handbook 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. * Oral and genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention) * Reduction of HSV transmission from people with recurrent infection to uninfected individuals * Herpes zoster (shingles): the typical dosage for treatment of herpes is 1,000 mg orally three times a day for seven consecutive days. * Prevention of cytomegalovirus following organ transplantation * Prevention of herpesviruses in immunocompromised people (such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy) *Chickenpox in children (ages 2‚Äì18) It has shown promise as a treatment for infectious mononucleosis and is preventively administered in suspected cases of herpes B virus exposure. Valaciclovir is not recommended in Bell's palsy due to lack of benefit. Adverse effects Common adverse drug reactions (‚â•1% of people) associated with valaciclovir are the same as for aciclovir, its active metabolite. They include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1‚Äì1% of patients) include: agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, edema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, weakness and/or renal impairment. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include: coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, encephalopathy, psychotic symptoms, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or anaphylaxis.  Pharmacology  Valaciclovir belongs to a family of molecules. Valaciclovir is a prodrug, an esterified version of aciclovir that has greater oral bioavailability (about 55%) than aciclovir. It is converted by esterases to the active drug, aciclovir, and the amino acid, valine, via hepatic first-pass metabolism. Aciclovir is selectively converted into a monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase, which is more effective (3000 times) in phosphorylation of aciclovir than cellular thymidine kinase. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is further phosphorylated into a disphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and then into the active triphosphate form, aciclo-GTP, by cellular kinases. = Mechanism of action = Aciclo-GTP, the active triphosphate metabolite of aciclovir, is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. Aciclo-GTP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. It has also been shown that the viral enzymes cannot remove aciclo-GMP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further activity of DNA polymerase. Aciclo-GTP is fairly rapidly metabolized within the cell, possibly by cellular phosphatases.http://www.uscnk.us/protein-antibody- elisa/Valaciclovir-%28VCV%29-V511.htm Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity: *Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) *Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) *Varicella zoster virus (VZV) *Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV) *Cytomegalovirus (CMV) The drug is predominantly active against HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. It is only of limited efficacy against EBV and CMV. However, valacyclovir has been shown to lower or eliminate the presence of the Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus in subjects afflicted with acute mononucleosis, leading to a significant decrease in the severity of symptoms.Balfour et al. (December 2005) A controlled trial of valacyclovir in infectious mononucleosis. Presented at the 45th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Washington, DC., December 18, 2005. Abstract V1392 Although it can prevent the establishment of viral latency, acyclovir therapy has not proven effective at eradicating latent viruses in nerve ganglia. As of 2005, resistance to valaciclovir has not been significant. Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase and mutations to viral thymidine kinase and/or DNA polymerase that alter substrate sensitivity. It also is used for herpes B virus postexposure prophylaxis.  History  Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£3 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$2.80. In 2017, it was the 152nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Formulations It is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade names Valtrex and Zelitrex. Valaciclovir has been available as a generic drug in the U.S. since November 25, 2009. Valtrex is offered in 500 mg and 1 gram tablets, with the active ingredient valacyclovir hydrochloride. The inactive ingredients include carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, FD&C; Blue No. 2 Lake, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, and titanium dioxide.

Nineteenth century 1851- The U.S. government imposed a treaty on the Dakota people, Siouan-speaking Native Americans who had been in this territory since at least the 17th century. Indigenous peoples of varying cultures had lived in the area for thousands of years before that. The treaty allowed European-American settlement in southern Minnesota. Most of the Dakota were removed to a reservation near New Ulm, Minnesota. The treaty marked part of the decline of the Dakotah Nation, adversely affected by infectious disease and warfare. The people have undergone a revival since the later 20th century, however. The treaty paved the way for the foundation of Northfield. 1851- William Marshall surveyed land and helped John W. North, a migrant from Syracuse, New York, pick out land to build mills and a town, to be called Northfield. 1854- May, Daniel Kuykendall was the first European-American pioneer to arrive in the area. Others soon followed. 1855- On August 17, 1855, North purchased 160 acres (647,000 m¬≤) of land from each of the other two original pre-emptors. 1856- September, Miron W. Skinner and his brother moved to Northfield and opened the second town store. He was instrumental in the establishment of Northfield College, now known as Carleton College. (See 1916 note about building of Skinner Chapel on the campus.) 1856- Herman Jenkins built the first hotel in Northfield. 1857 John L. Schofield came to Northfield and was the town‚Äôs first doctor. He built the first drugstore, which was attached to his house. John North suffered financial failure in the Panic of 1857. 1859- Charles Augustus Wheaton bought John North's financial interests and became one of the early town leaders. 1865- Jesse Ames moved to town and bought mills from Charles Augustus Wheaton. 1866- The Minnesota Conference of Congregational Churches and Charles M. Goodsell established Northfield College, later named Carleton College. 1867- Wheaton and Goodsell each gave a plot of land to the fledgling Northfield College to establish the college campus north of the main part of town. 1871- Northfield College changes its name to Carleton College, after benefactor William Carleton of Charlestown, Massachusetts, who had given US$50,000 to the fledgling institution. 1875- Hiram Scriver was elected first mayor of Northfield. 1874- St. Olaf College was founded by Rev. B.J. Muus, Harold Thorson and two area farmers, members of the Norwegian Lutheran Church. 1876- September 7, Attempted robbery of the First National Bank by the James-Younger gang. Bank treasurer Joseph Lee Heywood was killed after refusing to open bank safe. 1877- James D. Archer opened the second hotel in the Northfield area. (see 1959 note about Dallas Haas below) 1882- W. S. Pattee was superintendent of schools and also taught at Carleton College. Later he practiced law in Northfield, and became dean of the law school at the University of Minnesota. 1884‚ÄîJoel P. Heatwole arrived in Northfield. He bought The News and made it the leading weekly newspaper in the state. Technologically, it was a model of what a printing office should be. 1889- Margaret Evans' administrative title at Carleton College was changed to ‚Äúlady principal‚Äù and in 1898 to ‚Äúdean of the women‚Äôs department.‚Äù Known as Dean Evans, she was a towering figure in Carleton history. 1893- J. C. Nutting, president of First National Bank, planned and financed the construction of the Nutting Block to house the Northfield Knitting Company. 1895- W. F. Schilling came to Northfield. Once an editor of the Northfield News, Schilling became a Holstein breeder and a prominent agriculturalist in the state and the nation. He wrote the book, \\"My first Eighty Years‚Äù, which was published in 1952 by Mohn Printing. 1897- Link Fey, built one of the first successful gasoline-powered automobiles in Minnesota. 1898- Laura M. Baker opened a school to serve special students under the age of fourteen. Twentieth century 1914- Northfield adopted a town slogan, ‚ÄúNorthfield: Cows, Colleges and Contentment.‚Äù The slogan was replaced by \\"Northfield: A Special Place,\\" in the 1960s. In the 1980s, sentiment, a sense of humor, and marketing savvy lead to the renewed use of the old slogan. 1916- Emily Willey Skinner, wife of Miron W.

It was originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories and is now developed by a US company, Reaction Design. CHEMKIN solves thousands of reaction combinations to develop a comprehensive understanding of a particular process, which might involve multiple chemical species, concentration ranges, and gas temperatures. Chemical kinetics simulation software allows for a more time-efficient investigation of a potential new process compared to direct laboratory investigation. One important driver for the development and use of CHEMKIN is the reduction of pollutants, such as NOx. As these pollutants become more tightly regulated through agreements by agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resource Board (CARB), researchers are making increasing use of simulation technology. One limitation of CHEMKIN is that it assumes the reaction vessel has a relatively simple geometry, whereas sometimes this is not the case. For that reason, a related program called KINetics is often used in conjunction with Computational Fluid Dynamics tools. CFD programs are better able to account for geometric complexity, at the expense of being more limited in their treatment of the underlying chemistry of the reactive process being studied.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris. Background Sampson has a Bachelor of Arts degree and an MBA from Queen's University. Sampson worked at the Toronto branch of the Toronto Dominion Bank from 1980 to 1987, and at the Toronto branch of Chase Manhattan from 1987 to 1995. He also worked for Brays Lane Consulting in 1995, and is a Fellow in the Institute of Canadian Bankers. In 1992-93, he was an Executive Member of the Planning Advisory Committee for the City of Toronto. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Steve Mahoney (later a federal cabinet minister under Jean Chr√©tien) by about 3,000 votes in the riding of Mississauga West. This was considered an upset; the Tories performed extremely well in Mississauga in this election, but most observers expected that Mahoney would retain his seat. He was named a Minister without Portfolio in Mike Harris's government on 16 August 1996, with responsibility for privatization. During his time as Minister of Privatization, he was best known for sale of the 407-ETR Major Highway for $3.1 billion. The highway was sold to a consortium including the Spanish company Grupo Ferrovial and its subsidiary Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, SNC-Lavalin, and Capital d'Amerique CDPQ, a subsidiary of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec. The sale was heavily criticized as being well below value. It was estimated that the cost of acquiring the land exceeded $100 billion since the 1970s. Sampson was re-elected in the new riding of Mississauga Centre in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal George Winter by over 4,000 votes. He was promoted to Minister of Correctional Services on 17 June 1999. He stepped down from this position on 4 December 2000 to demonstrate ministerial responsibility after a backbench Tory named Doug Galt listed the names of several young offenders in the legislature; he was returned to his position on March 8, 2001. Sampson is a committed Neo-conservative, and supported numerous right-wing economic policy initiatives during his time in government, including the controversial privatization of Highway 407. As Correctional Services minister, he promoted the privatization of Ontario's prison system despite warnings that this could result in decreased safety. Sampson was dropped from cabinet when Ernie Eves succeeded Mike Harris as party leader in 2002. In the provincial election of 2003, he was defeated by Liberal Harinder Takhar by fewer than 3,000 votes, amid a general decline in support for the Tories in Mississauga. =Cabinet positions= References External links * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:People from Kingston, Ontario Category:People from Mississauga Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Rob Sampson"},{"id":"1257938","text":"New Zealand Hip Hop derives from the wider hip hop cultural movement originating amongst African Americans in the United States. Like the parent movement, New Zealand hip hop consists of four parts: rapping, DJing, graffiti art and breakdancing. The first element of hip hop to reach New Zealand was breakdancing, which gained notoriety after the release of the 1979 movie The Warriors. The first hip hop hit single, \\"Rapper's Delight\\" by the Sugarhill Gang, became a hit in New Zealand when it was released there in 1980, a year after it was released in the United States. By the middle of the 1980s, breakdancing and graffiti art were established in urban areas like Wellington and Christchurch. By the early 1990s hip hop became a part of mainstream New Zealand culture. Music =Early years and MƒÅori influence= Some of the first hip hop musicians to achieve recognition combined American styles with MƒÅori language and traditional songs. Dalvanius Prime's 1984 \\"Poi E\\" incorporated hip hop dance elements into its music video and was the first time New Zealanders viewed hip hop culture in association with a local recording. The song, which was entirely in MƒÅori, became a hit in New Zealand. Upper Hutt Posse likewise combined hip hop and MƒÅori culture in their 1988 single \\"E Tu\\", which is recognised as New Zealand's first pure hip hop single. A bootleg recording of their song \\"Hardcore Hiphop\\" reached number one on Christchurch student radio in February 1988. Some rappers, such as the members of Upper Hutt Posse, became known for politicised lyrics in support of tino rangatiratanga (MƒÅori sovereignty). Another popular MƒÅori group which incorporated hip hop music was Moana and the Moahunters, which won a New Zealand Music Industry award for best MƒÅori recording in 1992, speaking out against the perceived racism they saw against MƒÅori people in New Zealand. They cited the rarity of airtime on national radio for MƒÅori music and the exclusion from the mainstream music industry as reflective of the wider societal problem.Mitchell, Tony. \\"Kia Kaha! (Be Strong!): MƒÅori and Pacific Islander Hip-hop in Aotearoa-New Zealand.\\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, ed. Tony Mitchell, 280-305. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001. The awarded song is called \\"AEIOU (Akona Te Reo)\\", and translates as \\"Learn the Language\\". Its release was directed primarily at MƒÅori youth who did not speak MƒÅori. The majority of the lyrics are in English. Early hip hop releases in New Zealand included the collection Ak89 - In Love With These Rhymes, compiled by Simon Laan and released by Auckland radio bFm in 1989 (on cassette only), and a variety of releases by Southside Records. Amongst these were releases by Urban Disturbance featuring a young rapper, Zane Lowe, now a UK radio personality, and MC OJ & Rhythm Slave. By the late 1980s, the South Auckland and West Auckland hip hop scenes were thriving, with dozens of young acts, many promoted as part of the Voodoo Rhyme syndicate which featured acts such as the Semi MCs, MC Slam & DJ Jam, Total Effect, Sisters Underground, Enemy Productions (which featured a very young Dei Hamo), Boy C & the BB3 (which later became Three the Hard Way), the Chain Gang and others. Most of the acts that joined the Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate were discovered through talent contests by Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate founder, DJ Andy Vann. The Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate hosted Voodoo dance parties to raise funds to record the acts, and formed Voodoo vinyl in 1989. Voodoo Vinyl's first release in 1989 was Enemy Productions Stop Tagging produced by founder Andy Vann. Other notable related releases include Semi MCs' \\"Set Your Body Free & Trust Me\\" and MC Slam & DJ Jam's \\"Prove Me Wrong\\", both of which achieved Top 40 success in New Zealand. A DJ competition was held in Auckland in 1989, with DJ Ned Roy winning. The first major New Zealand commercial hip hop hit was \\"Hip Hop Holiday\\" by 3 The Hard Way, featuring the vocal stylings of Bobbylon (from the seminal 1990s Reggae/Punk band the Hallelujah Picassos). Released by Deepgrooves Entertainment and distributed by Festival Records, it sampled \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" by 10CC and became a number one hit in 1994. Upper Hutt Posse's DJ, DLT, also influenced the local scene in Auckland, including Joint Force, Che Fu and Dam Native. DLT began the influential radio show True Skool Hip Hop Show, which joined Wellington's Wednesday Night Jam in promoting hip hop. Simon Grigg & Nick D'Angelo championed hip hop on a dedicated hip hop radio show on bFm). =Polynesian influence= In Wellington, K.O.S.-163, more commonly known as Kosmo, influenced the hip hop scene during the 1980s. Returning from a visit to Los Angeles, Kosmo introduced a new type of dance called popping to New Zealand. Aware of their accents and other 'foreign' markers, Samoan youth in California used dancing and hip hop to assert themselves. Nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music influenced the scene in other cities, including Wellington.Henderson, April K. \\"Dancing Between Islands: Hip Hop and the Samoan Diaspora.\\" In The Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 180-199. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press, 200 With two other New Zealanders, Kosmo started the hip hop group called \\"The Mau\\". The name represents Samoan independence.Cultural Self-Esteem - The Resource  The Next Wellington's underground scene was vibrant in the late '80s, from whence arose the local supergroup Rough Opinion and a wave of performers like The Wanderers, Temple Jones and Hamofide. In the 1990s Maori and Polynesian hip hop musicians grew steadily more popular. Pauly Fuemana as OMC with Alan Jansson took the urban Pacific sound into the world's charts with the multi-million selling \\"How Bizarre\\", in 1995. It remains the best- selling song ever recorded in New Zealand. Rapper Scribe became the first to top both the single and album charts at the same time in 2004. Savage became the first New Zealand hip hop artist in history to have a single achieve platinum certification status in the United States with his single \\"Swing\\". The track featured in the 2007 film Knocked Up. Many top hip hop artists are signed with Dawn Raid Entertainment, a Polynesian-run record label based in Manukau. Dawn Raid briefly went out of business early in 2007 after financial problems resulting from the expensive production of several albums. Che Fu remains one of New Zealand's most successful hip hop artists. He began his career at high school with a group of friends and they eventually formed the Low Down Dirty Blues Band, which went on to be the legendary Supergroove. Their first album, Traction sold triple platinum and went on to win countless awards. Che Fu's fame continued through the 90s with his involvement with DLT in the number one hit song Chains in 1996, and in 2002 he won album of the year in the New Zealand music awards.New Zealand Hip Hop - A selection of New Zealand Hip Hop Artists =Hip hop in the 2000s and 2010s= The years 2004-2005 are often seen as a high-water mark for the popularity of hip hop music in New Zealand, and a book on the subject, Hip Hop Music In Aotearoa, won a national book award.Hip Hop Book Wins Montana Award Smashproof's single \\"Brother\\", featuring singer Gin Wigmore, reached the top of the New Zealand charts in 2009.Walters, Laura. \\"Cydel Top Vodafone Pacific Music Awards.\\" Stuff. Fairfax New Zealand Limited, 13 June 2015. Web. 10 Aug. 2016. Modern New Zealand hip hop has evolved into many styles, and artists such as Team Dynamite, Homebrew, Louie Knuxx, Rizv√°n and the like are popular in New Zealand, and artists tend to incorporate many elements from different genres. Classic artists such as Che Fu and King Kapisi are still very much current in the music scene and perform regularly also, and have been a major influence on the sound of hip hop in this country.  APRA Silver Scroll Award  The annual APRA Silver Scroll Awards in New Zealand is a prestigious honour for New Zealand songwriters. In 1999, King Kapisi became the first hip hop artist to receive the Silver Scroll Award for his single Reverse Resistance. In 2002, Che Fu (and Godfrey de Grut) won for Misty Frequencies, Nesian Mystik in 2004 with their single For the People, and in 2004, Scribe and P-Money won with their huge hit Not Many.http://www.apra.co.nz/html/awardpage2008.php?id=5354 Notable artists * 3 The Hard Way * Che Fu * David Dallas aka Con Psy * Deceptikonz * DLT * Double J and Twice the T * Frontline * Home Brew Crew * King Kapisi * Machete Clan * Mareko * MC OJ & Rhythm Slave * Nesian Mystik * OMC * P-Money * PNC * Rapture Ruckus * Rizvan * Savage * Scribe * Sisters Underground * Tommy Ill * Young Sid * MR Sicc * Kiwimane Breakdancing Breakdancing first came to New Zealand via TV, Movies and American Samoa through Western Samoa in the early 1980s. One can see the influence of Samoan culture in New Zealand's appropriation of breakdancing specifically through language. The term \\"bopping,\\" for example, comes from a Samoan pronunciation of popping, one of the elements in breakdance, where a dancer will move in a stilted fashion, isolating their limbs robotically.Kopytko, Tania. \\"Breakdance as an Identity Marker in New Zealand.\\" Yearbook for Traditional Music Vol. 18 (1986): 21-28. After its initial period of popularity, breakdancing fell out of fashion for most of the 1990s. Late in that decade it underwent a revival, and breakdancing stages can be found at events such as the Aotearoa Hip-Hop Summit. The nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music in California has significantly impacted Samoan cultural production in other places where Samoans have settled, including New Zealand.Henderson, April K. \\"Dancing Between Islands: Hip Hop and the Samoan Diaspora.\\" In The Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 180-199. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press, pg 183 The dancing in New Zealand is heavily influenced by American dances. One reason break dancing became popular was that many youth saw it as a way of being recognized or a channel of identity. Maori youth that had little chance of being recognized for accomplishments in school or sport found break dancing as a new way to achieve recognition. Early on, New Zealand even sponsored a national break dancing competition for young Maori and Pacific Islanders. This helped many young breakers to realize their potential by giving them a nation audience.Kopytko, Tania \\"Breakdance as an Identity Marker in New Zealand\\"pp. 21-28 Many of the Maori and Pacific Island youth found alternative possibilities to organize their daily lives. Images of street dance arriving via imported American media - such as the movies Flashdance or Beat Street granted a legitimacy to their efforts.

In 1999 the Dowse Art Museum mounted an exhibition of street art called Style Crimes, followed by Common Ground in 2009. Exhibitions signalled street art‚Äôs growing acceptance as a legitimate art form. The artistic quality of the best work was recognised and practitioners were able to make a career out of street art. Some were commissioned by local councils and businesses to create pieces. Organisations for troubled youth ran legal graffiti sessions. Another early event was Disrupt the System, organised in Aotea Square, Auckland, in 2000. More recent events include Nelson‚Äôs Oi You! (first held in 2010), Taup≈ç‚Äôs Graffiato (2011), Auckland‚Äôs All Fresco (2013), Christchurch‚Äôs From the Ground Up (2013) and Kawerau‚Äôs Street Legal (2014).Kerryn Pollock.

He started out tagging as a teenager in the 1990s and graduated to pieces, and eventually to works on canvas. Some street artists work together in collectives. Smooth Inc were at work in Auckland in the 1980s. They were followed by TMD (The Most Dedicated) in the mid-1990s. Cut Collective was founded in 2006. Its members have been commissioned to make public murals, and have exhibited at the Dowse Art Museum, Auckland Art Gallery and Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Many female artists have gained recognition for their work, including Diva, Misery (Tanja Thompson), Flox (Hayley King), Erin Forsyth, Xoe Hall and Mica Still.

Their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a non-avian dinosaur, rivaling that of modern mammals such as the domestic cow. They reached their apex of diversity and ecological dominance in the hadrosaurids (colloquially known as 'duck-bills'), before they were wiped out by the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event along with all other non-avian dinosaurs. Members are known from all seven continents, though they are generally rare in the Southern Hemisphere. History of research In 1870, Thomas Henry Huxley listed Iguanodontidae (coined by Cope a year earlier) as one of his three families of dinosaurs (alongside Megalosauridae and Scelidosauridae), including within it the genera Iguanodon, Hypsilophodon, and Hadrosaurus, in addition to Cetiosaurus and tentatively Stenopelix. The term Ornithopoda was erected by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1881 as part of his then still ongoing investigation of the classification of Dinosauria. It was considered one of the four definite orders of dinosaurs, the others being Theropoda, Sauropoda, and Stegosauria (Hallopoda was considered a possible fifth). He subdivided the order into three families: Camptonotidae, Iguanodontidae, and Hadrosauridae; the former was a new name, whereas the latter two were carried over from the nomenclatures of Huxley and Edward Drinker Cope respectively. Within Camptonotidae he included the European Hypsilophodon and three American taxa he named himself, Camptonotus, Laosaurus, and Nanosaurus. Camptonotus was in 1885 renamed to Camptosaurus, as the original name was pre-occupied by a cricket; the associated family follow suit, becoming Camptosauridae. In Iguanodontidae, only found in Europe, he included Iguanodon and Vectisaurus. In Hadrosauridae, he included Hadrosaurus, Cionodon, and tentatively Agathaumas. Description Three-toed feet of Iguanodon Ornithopoda means \\"bird feet\\", from the Greek ornithos (\\"bird\\") and pous (\\"feet\\"); this refers to their characteristic three-toed feet, although many early forms retained four toes. They were also characterized by having no armour, the development of a horny beak, an elongated pubis that eventually extended past the ilium, and a missing hole in the lower jaw, called a Mandibular fenestrae. A variety of ornithopods and related cerapods had thin cartilaginous plates along the outside of the ribs; in some cases, these plates mineralized and were fossilized. The function of these intercostal plates is unknown. They have been found with Hypsilophodon, Othnielosaurus, Parksosaurus, Talenkauen, Thescelosaurus, and Macrogryphosaurus to date. Size of a variety of numerous ornithopods The early ornithopods were only about 1 metre (3 feet) long, but probably very fast. They had a stiff tail, like the theropods, to help them balance as they ran on their hind legs. Later ornithopods became more adapted to grazing on all fours; their spines curved, and came to resemble the spines of modern ground-feeders such as the bison. As they became more adapted to eating while bent over, they became facultative quadrupeds; still running on two legs, and comfortable reaching up into trees; but spending most of their time walking or grazing while on all fours. The taxonomy of dinosaurs previously ascribed to the Hypsilophodontidae is problematic. The group previously consisted of all non-iguanodontian bipedal ornithischians, but a phylogenetic reappraisal has shown such species to be paraphyletic. As such, the hypsilophodont family is currently represented only by Hypsilophodon. Later ornithopods became larger, but never rivalled the incredible size of the long-necked, long-tailed sauropods that they partially supplanted. The very largest, such as Shantungosaurus, were as heavy as medium-sized sauropods at up to 23 metric tons (25 short tons) but never grew much beyond 15 metres (50 feet). Classification An artist's interpretation of Gideonmantellia, sometimes considered one of the most primitive ornithopods Restoration of Muttaburrasaurus, an early iguanodont Skeleton of Dysalotosaurus, a dryosaurid ornithopod from the Jurassic Life restoration of Iguanacolossus, an early styracosternan Reconstruction of Mantellisaurus, a primitive member of the Hadrosauriformes Mounted skeleton of Edmontosaurus, a saurolophine hadrosaur, and one of the last ornithopods Historically, most indeterminate ornithischian bipeds were lumped in as ornithopods. Most have since been reclassified. =Taxonomy= Ornithopoda is usually given the rank of Suborder, within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favour among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Benton (2004) placed it as an infraorder within the suborder Cerapoda (originally named as an unranked clade), while others, such as Ibiricu et al. 2010, have retained it at its traditional ranking of suborder. =Phylogeny= The cladogram below follows a 2017 analysis by Madzia et al.: References External links * GEOL 104 dinosaurs: a Natural history, ornithopoda: beaks, bills & crests, by Thomas R.

The stadium's name derives from the initials of its owners and operators, the Western Australian Cricket Association. The WACA has been referred to as Western Australia's \\"home of cricket\\" since the early 1890s, with Test cricket played at the ground since the 1970‚Äì71 season.The Ashes ‚Äì 2nd Test Australia v England The ground is the home venue of Western Australia's first-class cricket team, the Western Warriors, and the state's Women's National Cricket League side, the Western Fury. The Perth Scorchers, a Big Bash League franchise, played home matches at the ground until 2019.#THEFURNACE perthscorchers.com.au. Retrieved on 20 Dec 2015 The Scorchers and Australian national team have shifted most matches to the nearby 60,000-seat Optus Stadium. The pitch at the WACA is regarded as the quickest and bounciest in the world. These characteristics, in combination with the afternoon sea-breezes which regularly pass the ground (the Fremantle Doctor), have historically made the ground an attractive place for pace and swing bowlers. The outfield is exceptionally fast, contributing to the ground seeing some very fast scoring ‚Äì as of February 2016, four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA. The WACA has also hosted 7 scores of 99 in Test cricket - the most of any ground in the world. Throughout its history, the ground has also been used for a range of other sports, including athletics carnivals, Australian rules football, baseball, soccer, rugby league, rugby union, and international rules football. However, recent years have seen most of these activities relocated to other venues. It has also been used for major rock concerts. Early history An early coloured image of the Association ground in about 1910, looking north, with a large crowd watching a game in progress. Note the original 1890s stand is evidently packed. William Henry Wise, a gardener who came to WA from England in 1880, laid the first turf wicket at the WACA. Wise was personal gardener to Sir George Shenton, of Crawley. In addition to his work at the WACA Ground, he laid the first tennis court on the Perth Esplanade. The Western Australian Cricket Association was officially established on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of JCH James. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying a site of old swamp land to the east of the city. The association has a 999-year lease over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has freehold title (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government's consent). Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000 m¬≤), and took in what is now Gloucester Park. However, the latter part of the land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. Between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) World Series Cricket matches were played at Gloucester Park because the Kerry Packer-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA. The first match played on the turf wickets took place in February 1894. However, difficulties encountered in transporting teams to Western Australia meant that the ground was not part of Australia's main cricket community for many years. Even with the building of a transcontinental railway, the trip from the eastern states still took several days. It took the introduction of scheduled flights to Western Australia to make the WACA readily accessible to interstate or overseas teams. James Gardiner, president of the WACA for three terms between 1897 and 1924, proposed the adoption of 'electorate' cricket (as it was first known) whereby teams were established on a district basis for competition.The West Australian, 29 October 1928. He also inaugurated Country Week cricket, during which country teams compete against each other.Western Australian Cricketing Association 1924, Annual Report 1923, Perth. In 1907, the WACA ground was under threat of being controlled by the Perth City Council to recover debts. Gardiner led the bid to save the ground and secured a government loan. Further financial difficulties led Gardiner to again raise funds and donations with a cricket match by the Australian XI team in 1912. Photo taken during a domestic match at the WACA Ground in 1951. Ground developments The WACA scoreboard at its opening in December 1953 The WACA Scoreboard in 2015 The WACA ground, like many stadiums of its era, has undergone various re-developments. The most notable are: * The building, in 1895, of the first grandstand; seating 500 people and incorporating dressing rooms, a dining room, bathrooms, members' rooms and bars. * In 1931 the Farley Stand was opened, named after W.J. Farley, the association's president from 1915‚Äì1916 to 1916‚Äì17 and secretary from 1917‚Äì1918 to 1928‚Äì1929. * In 1948 the scoreboard at the WACA was destroyed by a storm. In 1954 a replacement scoreboard was built, a donation from the North West Murchison Cricket Association. This, now iconic, scoreboard remains in operation. * In the 1960s the Players Pavilion was built to provide facilities for the players and the WACA administration. Additional seating was later added, initially to accommodate the first Test Match to be played at the WACA (Australia v England in 1970). * Also to welcome Test cricket to the WACA, 1970 saw the opening of the \\"Test Stand\\". It was later renamed the Inverarity Stand, after Western Australian, South Australian and Australian player John Inverarity. * From 1984 to 1988 the WACA underwent major renovations, including a realignment and a complete resurfacing of the ground and the construction of new terracing and seating in the outer. Also built were the three tiered Prindiville grandstand and two tiered Lillee-Marsh grandstand, which increased the ground's seating capacity. Six large light towers were also installed in 1986 at a cost of $4.2 million, allowing for night time sports such as day-night cricket matches to be played at the ground. An icon of the WACA, the floodlights are 70 metres high and cost $600 per hour to run. The WACA facing north, showing the Inverarity Stand (left) and the Prindiville Stand (right) These redevelopments also made the venue an attractive venue for sports other than cricket, and it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s that the ground saw its greatest use as a multi-sports venue. From 1987 to 2000, the ground was used by the West Coast Eagles, and from 1995 by the Fremantle Dockers, both Western Australian- based AFL teams. 72 AFL matches were held at the ground during this time. From 1995 to 1997 the WACA also served as the home ground for the Western Reds rugby league team. In the late 1990s the ground played host to the Perth Heat in the former Australian Baseball League (1989-1999). However, for various reasons these sports moved away from the WACA (in the case of night football, to Subiaco Oval), and as a consequence the WACA was again redeveloped in 2002. The capacity of the ground was reduced to around 20,000 and the dimensions of the playing arena were also decreased by a total of 31 metres at the eastern and western boundaries, meaning Australian rules football could no longer be played at the ground. From time to time, temporary stands are used to boost the ground's capacity to 24,500. In 2013, a new video screen was installed at the WACA near the old scoreboard, replacing one of the old temporary screens. In 2019, the Western Australian Government provided a $100,000 grant to the Western Australian Cricket Association to construct two new change rooms under the Lillie Marsh Stand to support women's cricket in the state. Construction is set to be complete for the change rooms in time for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The WACA Museum (located on-site) features exhibits about Western Australian cricket. =Proposed further development= In April 2007 the Western Australian Cricket Association announced a $250m redevelopment of the stadium. Seating capacity was to be increased, with residential and commercial buildings built in the surrounding areas.EPRA projects: WACA EPRA website, November 2008.

The agreement between the WACA and Ascot Capital would have seen new northern grandstands, an increase in ground capacity and a long term revenue stream. However, in December 2013 the WACA released a statement that it had abandoned the so-called Gardens Development because it was unable to achieve the pre-sales target in order to finance the project.ABC News, WACA abandons plan for apartments on site to fund upgrade of ground, 17 December 2013. In September 2013 Cricket Australia announced that the WACA ground would not host a Test match in the shortened 2014/15 season to accommodate the 2015 Cricket World Cup, a decision which left Perth without a summer test match for the first time in nearly 40 years. Cricket Australia said the WACA Ground required significant improvements, given it has the smallest capacity of the five mainland capital city venues.ABC News WACA upset over loss of Perth Test match for 2014-15, 17 December 2013. As of the 2018/19 summer, the WACA Ground is no longer the primary international cricket venue in Perth. Perth Stadium in Burswood now hosts limited overs internationals, Test matches against high-drawing opponents (England, India and South Africa), and domestic Big Bash League (BBL) matches for Perth Scorchers. The WACA Ground will continue to host Tests against lower-drawing opponents and Sheffield Shield matches. Several years before construction of Perth Stadium concluded, the WACA proposed developing the ground into a 15,000-capacity boutique stadium with improved facilities, though this has yet to eventuate.WACA Ground Development In March 2019 the WACA unveiled plans to improve cricket training facilities and enable the ground to host large-scale community events. The plans also include a proposal to reshape the ground to once again be capable of hosting Australian rules football matches, notably marquee WAFL matches. The total cost would be $75 million, of which $60 million would need to be either privately financed or granted by state and federal governments.WACA Ground plan to become community-minded venue needs $60m in public funding In December 2019 the WACA confirmed a $30 million grant had been achieved from the Federal Government, likely allowing the proposed redevelopment to proceed in the coming years.Cricket Welcomes Federal Government Commitment To WACA Ground Notable events at the WACA ;1899 * The first first-class match was played on the ground between Western Australia and South Australia between 3 and 6 April 1899.

Despite being a work of fiction, the book contains many graphs and footnotes, two appendices, and a 20-page bibliography in support of Crichton's beliefs about global warming. Many climate scientists, science journalists, environmental groups, and science advocacy organisations dispute Crichton's views on the science as being error-filled and distorted. PDF version from climateprediction.net site The novel had an initial print run of 1.5 million copies and reached the #1 bestseller position at Amazon and #2 on The New York Times Best Seller list for one week in January 2005. The novel itself has garnered mixed reviews, with some literary reviewers stating that the book's presentation of facts and stance on the global warming debate detracted from the book's plot. Plot summary Peter Evans is a lawyer for a millionaire philanthropist, George Morton. Evans' main duties are managing the legal affairs surrounding Morton's contributions to an environmentalist organization, the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) (modeled after the Natural Resources Defense Council [NRDC]). Morton becomes suspicious of NERF's director, Nicholas Drake, after discovering that Drake has misused some of the funds Morton had donated to the group. Soon afterward, Morton is visited by two men, John Kenner and Sanjong Thapa, who appear on the surface to be researchers at MIT, but, in fact, are international law enforcement agents on the trail of an eco-terrorist group, the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF) (modeled on the Earth Liberation Front). The ELF is attempting to create \\"natural\\" disasters to convince the public of the dangers of global warming. All these events are timed to happen during a NERF-sponsored climate conference that will highlight the \\"catastrophe\\" of global warming. The eco- terrorists have no qualms about how many people are killed in their manufactured \\"natural\\" disasters and ruthlessly assassinate anyone who gets in their way (few would recognize their preferred methods as murder: the venom of a rare Australian blue-ringed octopus which causes paralysis, and \\"lightning attractors\\" which cause their victims to get electrocuted during electrical storms). Kenner and Thapa suspect Drake of being involved with the ELF to further his own ends (garnering more donations to NERF from the environmentally-minded public). Evans joins Kenner, Thapa, and Morton's assistant, Sarah Jones, on a globe-spanning series of adventures to thwart various ELF-manufactured disasters before these disasters kill thousands of people. Kenner's niece, Jennifer Haynes, joins the group for the final leg as they travel to a remote island in the Solomon Islands to stop the ELF's pi√®ce de r√©sistance, a tsunami that will inundate the California coastline just as Drake is winding up the international conference on the \\"catastrophe\\" of global warming. Along the way, the group battles man-eating crocodiles and cannibalistic tribesmen (who feast on Ted Bradley, an environmentalist TV actor whom Drake had sent to spy on Kenner and his team). The rest of the group is rescued in the nick of time by Morton, who had previously faked his own death to throw Drake off the trail so that he could keep watch on the ELF's activities on the island while he waited for Kenner and his team to arrive. The group has a final confrontation with the elite ELF team on the island during which Haynes is almost killed, and Evans kills one of the terrorists who had previously tried to kill both him and Jones in Antarctica. The rest of the ELF team is killed by the backwash from their own tsunami, which Kenner and his team have sabotaged just enough to prevent it from becoming a full-size tsunami and reaching California. Morton, Evans, and Jones return to Los Angeles. Evans quits his law firm to work for Morton's new, as yet unnamed, organization, which will practice environmental activism as a business, free from potential conflicts of interest. Morton hopes Evans and Jones will take his place in the new organization after his death.  Allegorical characters  Several critics have suggested that Crichton uses the major characters as proxies for differing viewpoints on the topic of global warming in order to allow the reader to clearly follow the various positions portrayed in the book. * Joseph Romm suggests that Kenner is a stand-in for Crichton himself. * David Roberts suggests that Evans is the stand-in for the reader (who Crichton presumes accepts most of the tenets of global warming without any detailed study of it, but not unquestioningly).http://www.grist.org/advice/books/2005/02/01/roberts-fear/ *David Roberts also suggests that Ted Bradley is a stand-in for people who accept the \\"environmentalist\\" party line without question.http://www.grist.org/advice/books/2005/02/01/roberts-fear/ * Ronald Bailey suggests that Drake is a stand-in for the environmental movement \\"professional\\" activist.Wall Street Journal Review * Bruce Barcott suggests that Sarah, and Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag suggest that Jennifer are stand-ins for the academic community (intelligent enough to follow the debate but undecided until the evidence is presented), with Sarah being the portion of the community likely to believe in global warming on less than undeniable evidence (they will accept \\"Likely, but not proven\\" as sufficient proof) and Jennifer representing the part of the community that accepts undeniable evidence only. * Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag suggest that Jennifer is simultaneously a stand-in for conflicts of interest created by how the research is funded (i.e., her \\"official\\" story changes based on who is paying the bills, but in private she makes her true feelings known). * Gregory Mone suggests that Sanjong is a stand-in for the local university library/reputable Internet source verification, etc.Popular Science's Review  Author's afterword/appendices  Crichton included a statement of his views on global climate change as an afterword. In the \\"Author's message\\", Crichton states that the cause, extent, and threat of climate change are largely unknown. He finishes by endorsing the management of wilderness and the continuation of research into all aspects of the Earth's environment. In Appendix I, Crichton warns both sides of the global warming debate against the politicization of science. Here he provides two examples of the disastrous combination of pseudoscience and politics: the early 20th-century ideas of eugenics (which he directly cites as one of the theories that allowed for the Holocaust) and Lysenkoism. This appendix is followed by a bibliography of 172 books and journal articles that Crichton presents \\"...to assist those readers who would like to review my thinking and arrive at their own conclusions.\\"(State of Fear, pp, 583). Also, throughout the novel part, there are sidenotes at the bottom of some pages when Crichton makes a reference to real data he read. The sidenotes include book title, an excerpt, and the page or pages you can find it on.  Global Warming  State of Fear is, like many of Crichton's books, a fictional work that uses a mix of speculation and real world data, plus technological innovations as fundamental storyline devices. The debate over global warming serves as the backdrop for the book. Crichton supplies a personal afterword and two appendices that link the fictional part of the book with real examples of his thesis. The main villains in the plot are environmental extremists. Crichton does place blame on \\"industry\\" in both the plot line and the appendices. Various assertions appear in the book, for example: * The science behind global warming is speculative and incomplete, meaning no concrete conclusions can be drawn regarding human involvement in climate change. * Elites in various fields use either real or artificial crises to maintain the existing social order, misusing the \\"science\\" behind global warming. * As a result of potential conflicts of interest, the scientists conducting research on topics related to global warming may subtly change their findings to bring them in line with their funding sources. Since climatology can not incorporate double-blind studies, as are routine in other sciences, and climate scientists set experiment parameters, perform experiments within the parameters they have set, and analyze the resulting data, a phenomenon known as \\"bias\\" is offered as the most benign reason for climate science being so inaccurate. * A key concept, delivered from the eccentric Professor Hoffman, suggests, in Hoffman's words, the existence of a \\"politico-legal-media\\" complex, comparable to the \\"military-industrial complex,\\" of the Cold War era. Hoffman insists climate science began using more extreme, fear-inducing terms such as \\"crisis,\\" \\"catastrophe,\\" and, \\"disaster,\\" shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in order to maintain a level of fear in citizens, for the purpose of social control, since the specter of Soviet Communism was gone. This \\"state of fear\\" gives the book its title. Numerous charts and quotations from real world data, including footnoted charts which strongly suggest mean global temperature is, in this era, lowering. Where local temperatures show a general rise in mean temperature, mostly in major world cities, Crichton's characters infer it is due to urban sprawl and deforestation, not carbon emissions. Crichton argues for removing politics from science and uses global warming and real-life historical examples in the appendices to make this argument. In a 2003 speech at the California Institute of Technology, he expressed his concern about what he considered the \\"emerging crisis in the whole enterprise of science‚Äînamely the increasingly uneasy relationship between hard science and public policy.\\"Aliens Cause Global Warming a speech give at the California Institute of Technology January 17, 2003 Reception =Literary reviews= The novel has received mixed reviews from professional literary reviewers. The Wall Street Journal's Ronald Bailey gave a favorable review, calling it \\"a lightning-paced technopolitical thriller\\" and the \\"novelization of a speech that Mr. Crichton delivered in September 2003 at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Gregory Kirschling gave a favorable A- review and said it was \\"one of Crichton's best because it's as hard to pigeonhole as greenhouse gas but certainly heats up the room.\\" In The New Republic, Sacha Zimmerman gave a mixed review. Zimmerman criticized Crichton's presentation of data as condescending to the reader but concluded that the book was a \\"globe- trotting thriller that pits man against nature in brutal spectacles while serving up just the right amount of international conspiracy and taking digs at fair-weather environmentalists.\\" Much criticism was given to Crichton's presentation of global warming data and the book's portrayal of the global warming debate as a whole. In the Sydney Morning Herald, John Birmingham criticized the book's usage of real world research and said it was \\"boring after the first lecture, but mostly in the plotting... It's bad writing and it lets the reader ignore the larger point Crichton is trying to make.\\" In The Guardian, Peter Guttridge wrote that the charts and research in the book got \\"in the way of the thriller elements\\" and stated the bibliography was more interesting than the plot. In The New York Times, Bruce Barcott criticized the novel's portrayal of the global warming debate heavily, stating that it only presented one side of the argument. In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Allan Walton gave a mostly favorable review and offered some praise for Crichton's work. Walton wrote that Crichton's books, \\"as meticulously researched as they are, have an amusement park feel. It's as if the author channels one of his own creations, \\"Jurassic Park's\\" John Hammond, and spares no expense when it comes to adventure, suspense and, ultimately, satisfaction.\\" =Criticism from scientific community= This novel received criticism from climate scientists, PDF version from climateprediction.net site science journalists and environmental groups for inaccuracies and misleading information. Sixteen of 18 US climate scientists interviewed by Knight Ridder said the author was bending scientific data and distorting research. Several scientists whose research had been referenced in the novel stated that Crichton had distorted it in the novel. Peter Doran, leading author of the Nature paper, as PDF wrote in the New York Times: \\"our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Michael Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear. Myles Allen, Head of the Climate Dynamics Group, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, wrote in Nature in 2005: > Michael Crichton's latest blockbuster, State of Fear, is also on the theme > of global warming and is, ...likely to mislead the unwary.... Although this > is a work of fiction, Crichton's use of footnotes and appendices is clearly > intended to give an impression of scientific authority. The American Geophysical Union, consisting of over 50,000 members from over 135 countries, states in their newspaper Eos in 2006, \\"We have seen from encounters with the public how the political use of State of Fear has changed public perception of scientists, especially researchers in global warming, toward suspicion and hostility.\\" James E. Hansen, former head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the time, wrote that Crichton \\"doesn't seem to have the foggiest notion about the science that he writes about.\\"Michael Crichton's \\"Scientific Method\\" James E. Hansen Jeffrey Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, writes: \\"Crichton presents an error-filled and distorted version of the Global Warming science, favoring views of the handful of contrarians that attack the consensus science of the IPCC.\\"Review of Michael Crichton's State of Fear : Weather Underground The Union of Concerned Scientists devote a section of their website to what they describe as misconceptions readers may take away from the book.  Recognition  =US Congress= Despite being a work of fiction, the book has found use by opponents of global warming. For example, US Senator Jim Inhofe, who once pronounced global warming \\"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\\", made State of Fear \\"required reading\\" for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which he chaired from 2003 to 2007, and before which he called Crichton to testify in September 2005. Al Gore said on March 21, 2007 before a US House committee: \\"The planet has a fever. If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor [...] if your doctor tells you you need to intervene here, you don't say 'Well, I read a science fiction novel that tells me it's not a problem. Several commentators interpreted this as a reference to State of Fear.Ansible 237, April 2007 =AAPG 2006 Journalism Award= The novel received the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) 2006 Journalism Award. AAPG Communications director Larry Nation told the New York Times, \\"It is fiction, but it has the absolute ring of truth\\". The presentation of this award has been criticized as a promotion of the politics of the oil industry and for blurring the lines between fiction and journalism. After some controversy within the organization, AAPG has since renamed the award the \\"Geosciences in the Media\\" Award.President 06:2006 EXPLORER Daniel P. Schrag, Director of the Center for the Environment at Harvard University, called the award \\"a total embarrassment\\" that he said \\"reflects the politics of the oil industry and a lack of professionalism\\" on the association's part. As for the book, he added \\"I think it is unfortunate when somebody who has the audience that Crichton has shows such profound ignorance\\".

His stage name is an homage to musician and actor Lelio Luttazzi. His favourite topics are politics, religion, sex and death. Biography Luttazzi was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna, province of Rimini. He began his comic career performing satirical monologues in theatre shows and writing comedy books. In 1988, his monologue won an award in a comedy contest held at Rome's Teatro Sistina. From 1989, he began working in TV variety shows: Fate il vostro gioco (1989, Rai 2), Banane (1989, Telemontecarlo), Magazine 3 (1993, 1994, Rai 3), Mai Dire Gol (1996, 1997, Italia 1). In 1998, he hosts his own late night show, Barracuda (Italia 1). Luttazzi did monologues about recent news, interviews with famous showbiz and political personalities, and skits for adult audiences. The same formula was then adopted for his next TV show, called Satyricon, aired by the public channel Rai 2 in 2001. In March 2001, Luttazzi interviewed journalist Marco Travaglio about \\"L'odore dei soldi\\" (The Scent of Money), a book on the mysterious origins of Silvio Berlusconi's wealth. The next year, shortly after Berlusconi's statement on the \\"criminal use of public television\\" made by Luttazzi (see Editto Bulgaro), Luttazzi's show was cancelled by RAI's management. Since then, Luttazzi has been often cited by the European press (i.e. The Economist, Le Monde, El Pa√≠s) as proof of Mr. Berlusconi's censorship of the opposition. After television, Luttazzi toured Italy doing theatre shows and wrote books. He returned on TV in 2007 with the new satirical program \\"Decameron: Politica, Sesso, Religione e Morte\\" (Decameron: Politics, Sex, Religion and Death) for the private channel La7. Eventually his show was suspended after a controversial joke on journalist Giuliano Ferrara (who was working for La7 too).Luttazzi exclusive interview with Articolo21 commenting on the announcement Luttazzi √® licenziato anche da La7 2012: Luttazzi wins his legal battle against La7. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.  Controversies  In 1994, Susanna Tamaro, bestselling author of \\"Va' dove ti porta il cuore\\", sued Luttazzi for plagiarism after his parody \\"Va' dove ti porta il clito\\". Luttazzi won the trial: it was a parody, not plagiarism. Since then, Luttazzi has been further accused of plagiarism. In 2001 the Italian progressive newspaper La Repubblica noticed the similarities between Luttazzi TV show Barracuda and the David Letterman Show. Luttazzi replied that the actual model of David Letterman is, in turn, Johnny Carson's Tonight Show and stated that all jokes and texts were original. In 2007, Christian Rocca, a journalist from \\"Il Foglio\\" (a conservative newspaper controlled by Silvio Berlusconi's family) accused Luttazzi of plagiarizing jokes from American comedians; and in 2010 several Italian newspapers reported of anonymous bloggers accusing him of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Eddie Izzard, Chris Rock, Bill Hicks and Robert Schimmel. The accusation of plagiarism, according to Luttazzi, is a misleading half-truth. Five years before those allegations, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds famous comedians' material to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. Luttazzi calls his ruse \\"the Lenny Bruce trick\\" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce.Ladies and gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!, Albert Goldman, Random House, 1974. Luttazzi asks his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a \\"nugget\\", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game \\"treasure hunt\\". Luttazzi also calls the allegations \\"naive\\", explaining why those jokes are not \\"plagiarized\\", but \\"calqued\\", which is a fair use of original material. He used a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context. Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works. In 2012, Luttazzi won the first step of a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \\"Decameron\\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. La7 was sentenced to pay 1,200,000 Euros as compensation. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not \\"plagiarised\\" ones. = Reactions = In 2010, a few commentators, after the first batch of news which did not mention Luttazzi's 2005 post in his blog about the \\"Lenny Bruce trick\\", said Luttazzi did what web aggregators do. Others, such as Wu Ming, pointed out that as a result many former fans were switching to angered detractors of Luttazzi, with the risk of denying Luttazzi's original artistic and cultural contributions and deep renovation of Italian satire. In Luttazzi's defense, film director Roberto Faenza quoted Roberto Benigni: Benigni compares Luttazzi's copying to the greatest artists' copying, writers like Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Shakespeare, Buster Keaton, Eduardo De Filippo, and Woody Allen.

Stunting is typically used to generate publicity and audience attention for upcoming changes to a station's programming, such as a new branding or format. Occasionally, a stunt may be purely intended as publicity or a protest, and not actually result in a major programming change. Stunts often involve a loop of a single song, or an interim format (such as the discography of a specific artist, Christmas music, a specific theme, or novelty songs), which may sometimes include hints towards the station's new format or branding. To a lesser extent, stunting has also been seen on television, most commonly in conjunction with April Fool's Day, or to emphasize a major programming event being held by a channel. Types of radio stunting and noted examples =Continuous loop= A station may stunt by repeating the same song or songs over and over on a continuous loop: * The song(s) in question are commonly in relation to the coming format or branding; in March 2014, San Francisco's KVVF and KVVZ stunted for three days with a loop of \\"Hot in Herre\\" by Nelly, which led into their impending flip from a Spanish format to rhythmic contemporary Hot 105.7. The stunt notably attracted mainstream media attention, with the hashtag \\"#nelly1057\\" being used to discuss the event on Twitter. * Oftentimes the song chosen for the loop does not pertain to either the old or new format: ** The earliest example is WNOE-AM, New Orleans, which in one of the oldest radio stunts recorded when it launched its Top 40 format in early 1955, it stunted by playing the record \\"Shtiggy Boom\\" by The Nuggets nonstop for 58 hours and 45 minutes. The more prime example came in 1961, the record amount of stunting broke WNOE's record when XEAK, San Diego/Tijuana, played \\"Mope- itty Mope\\" by The Bosstones for 72 hours straight before unveiling an all-news format, one of the first such radio formats in North America. ** In late-April 1994, WMGV/Winneconne stunted with a loop of 21 different versions of the song \\"Louie Louie\\" as Louie 103.9, before launching a new oldies format on May 3. ** In a reference to the Rickroll meme, the new Toronto radio station CIND-FM played a loop of Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" prior to its official launch as Indie 88. * For four days before the July 8, 2012, relaunch of KOKE- FM/Austin ‚Äî a station which popularized progressive country in the early 1970s, a live recording of Dale Watson's \\"Country My Ass\\" played in a continuous loop. This example of stunting is notable for the station-specific nature of the song's lyrics; Watson re-recorded the song for the occasion, adding a new coda in which he sings, \\"Now Austin's on track, 'cause KOKE-FM's back.\\" * In May 1990, the staff of Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio station Triple J engaged in an industrial action, protesting the suspension of its news director for playing a clip of the N.W.A. song \\"F*** tha Police\\" in a segment discussing its subject matter (despite the full song having been played by the station without incident). During the action, Triple J played another N.W.A. song, \\"Express Yourself\\", 82 times in a row. On April 28, 2014, in an homage to the event, ABC Dig Music began stunting with a loop of \\"Express Yourself\\" (including covers of the song by Australian musicians) to lead into its flip to Triple J's new sister station Double J on April 30. * WJMP/Kent, OH, in a protest over the Major League Baseball players' strike, played 2 versions of \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" continuously, sunrise-to- sunset (the station operates only during daytime hours), for 2 months (and 57,161 total plays) from August to October 1994. The stunt merited WJMP an entry in the Guinness Book of Sports Records. * In honor of the alleged Mayan apocalypse, modern rock station CFEX-FM/Calgary stunted with a loop of R.E.M.'s song \\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" on December 21, 2012, accompanied by \\"Apocalypse Survival Tips\\" and \\"Get to Know a Mayan\\" segments. * Prior to its August 26, 2019 flip to a sports talk format affiliated with Fox Sports Radio, WDAS/Philadelphia stunted with a loop of the NFL on Fox theme music over the preceding weekend. The change in format was announced in advance of the flip. *In February 2006 WSLT in Augusta GA dropped It's Adult Contemporary format, and went into stunting by airing a loop of a snippet of Gorillaz's Feel Good Inc by repeating the parts of De La Soul's laughing heard at the beginning,and end of the song nonstop for 24 hours to prepare for the launch of a CHR format with the branding HD 98.3. * Linder Radio Group is known for routinely using \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\" by Rolf Harris as a filler stunt when changing a format on one of its stations. =Temporary formats= Occasionally a station dropping an old format will stunt with a transitional format, either containing clues and previews relating to the new format (such as songs referencing its new branding, and artists who may be included in the eventual format), or having little to do with it. This can include songs based on specific themes (such as a single musician), or novelties that would not be viable as a permanent format. * One of the most common stunting stations in America is Seattle's KJR-FM which contains a numerous amount of stunts throughout the years. Most commonly, the station stunted with a new format after Clear Channel Communications bought KJR's former call-letters KBTB. On May 29, 2002, the station began stunting with 1200 10-second clips of songs from various genres for 2 days as Quick 96. The station then relaunched as Superhits 95.7 KJR-FM. * In 2006, after its sale to new owners, KFYE in Kingsburg, California, dropped its contemporary Christian music programming for a stunt format it dubbed \\"Porn Radio\\", featuring songs with sexually-suggestive lyrics (such as \\"I'm Too Sexy\\", \\"Sexual Healing\\", and \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\"), and songs overlaid with moaning sound effects. The stunt led into its relaunch as rhythmic adult contemporary Sexy 106.3. * On April 8, 2008 after KRBV of Los Angeles was sold to Bonneville International, the station stunted by playing only music by New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen for 10 hours as Bruce Radio 100.3 in connection of Bruce's show that occurred that night at the Honda Center of Anaheim. This led into the switch of KSWD-FM as 100.3 The Sound. On January 7, 2011, WCVS-FM in Springfield, Illinois began stunting the same all-Bruce Springsteen format for more than 12 hours, in connection to the switch of its classic rock format known as The Rock. * In May 2009, WSKS/Utica, NY, announced that, due to \\"financial constraints,\\" its CHR format would be replaced by the beautiful music format similar to what was broadcast on sister station WUTQ. The \\"change\\" came complete with on-air kayfabe-style complaining from the station's staff. The \\"new format,\\" however, lasted for only 2 hours before WSKS management came clean, restored the CHR format, and confirmed the stunt was a way to promote the station's new lineup. * As part of promotions for the series by local broadcaster Global, Toronto radio station CIRR-FM (which usually broadcasts a CHR format targeting the LGBT community) held a Glee FM stunt on April 12, 2010, devoting a larger amount of its playlist to music from the U.S. musical comedy-drama series Glee (accompanied by other pop songs of Canadian origin to satisfy Canadian content regulations). On August 16, 2010, British radio station Oxford's FM 107.9 held its own Glee FM stunt, leading into its August 18 relaunch as Glide FM. * Over Memorial Day weekend in 2010, WJZX-FM/Milwaukee, Wisconsin, stunted as Tiger 106.9, featuring songs about cheating (in reference to an infidelity scandal involving golfer Tiger Woods). The station was expected to change to a top 40 format with the new call letters WNQW‚Äîwith the new calls implying use of the brand Now. However, competing station WQBW abruptly flipped to the same format as 97.3 Now, preventing WJZX from using the name. The station continued airing temporary formats, such as patriotic music and The Beatles' discography in alphabetical order, before settling on a permanent format in June 2010, as classic country station WZBK-FM). * In 2011, WWWN/Chicago and WEMP/New York‚Äîwhich had recently been sold to Merlin Media‚Äîtransitioned from alternative rock to all-news radio as FM News. As a transitional format, both stations aired a format branded as FM New, which featured adult contemporary music interspersed with news, traffic, and weather updates from personalities who would serve under the new FM News formats. * On October 8, 2014, KROI/Houston ended its all-news format and began stunting as B92, playing only music by Houston-native Beyonc√©. The stunt led into its relaunch as classic hip-hop Boom 92. * KEGY/San Diego used an unbranded rock format as part of its transition from CHR to a new hot talk- oriented format in 2018. The stunt's playlist featured Pink Floyd's \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" at the top of each hour, which teased its eventual branding as The Machine. * Multiple stations in the United States and Canada have stunted with Chinese music under the branding Kung Pao, such as KDOG (which led into a flip to classic hits, WVHT (which led into its re-launch as CHR Hot 100), and CIGM (which led into its flip to a CHR format as Hot 93.5) Christmas music and other holiday formats The popular practice of radio stations playing all-Christmas music during the lead-up to (and occasionally the week after) Christmas Day has sometimes been used as a transitional period between formats. Sometimes, Christmas music is used as a more blatant stunt format outside of the holiday season, although other holidays makes an appearance. Not just Christmas, but only a few stations had their own stunts as other holiday formats before switching to either new formats or traditionally just Christmas for the holiday season. * As a soft launch in April 2008, Saskatoon's new radio station CFWD-FM briefly stunted with Christmas music as Santa FM, accompanied by a promotional campaign in which publicists in Santa Claus costumes paraded through the city. The station officially launched as CHR Wired 96.3. In November 2012, the station laid off its airstaff and flipped to Christmas music for the season, emerging as adult hits 96.3 Cruz FM on December 26, 2012. * Only a few stations in the United States have their own switch to their own music for their upcoming seasons besides Christmas. For example on October 30, 2009, KATZ-FM of St. Louis dropped their Urban Contemporary format enable to stunt Halloween Music known as Halloween 100.3 for 2 days. On November 1, 2009, the station dropped its previous format and began stunting Christmas music under the name of Christmas 100.3. The station then led into the launch of Modern Rock and Modern Adult Contemporary mixed format known as 100.3 The Sound 25 days later. * On August 24, 2011, Niagara Falls' CJED-FM made a 2 hour stunt of Christmas music after dropping its hot adult contemporary format before relaunching as an adult hits station entitled 105.1 ED FM. On September 19, 2013, the same station began stunting the same format for more than a day until relaunching as a CHR format known as 2day FM 105.1/101.1. * In late-September 2015, Duluth's WEBC dropped its sports radio format in favor of Ho Ho 106.5, before emerging in early-October as classic rock Sasquatch 106.5. * In November 2017, CBS Radio and Entercom merged, bringing Seattle's two country music stations, KMPS and KKWF, under common ownership. On the day the merger was completed, KMPS switched to Christmas music, ostensibly for the holiday season. However, on the morning of December 4, 2017, KMPS abruptly ended the all-Christmas programming and flipped to soft adult contemporary as 94.1 The Sound. The following year, Entercom's Detroit station WDZH flipped from CHR to the same format in an identical manner (with the station dropping its Amp Radio CHR format for The Rudolph Network, before becoming The Breeze three days later). *In March 2020, some radio stations in the United States began playing Christmas music to boost morale during the COVID-19 pandemic, including KEZK-FM in St. Louis and WNIC in Detroit. Others such as WWIZ in the Youngstown area (which had also been the first station in the nation to flip in 2019) flipped to Christmas music far earlier than usual, with WWIZ doing so exactly three months before the holiday and thus playing holiday music in September.WWIZ Youngstown Begins Christmas Music Season =Sound effects= In a prelude to a format flip, a series of audio clips and sound effects centered around a certain theme may be played. Known as a sound collage, the theme under which these bits of audio fall may or may not have something to do with the previous or new format. * The earliest example comes with following minutes to CFFR in Calgary's launch on January 10, 1984, sounds of a clock ticking along with various announcements and jingles were played minutes prior to CFFR's launch as an oldies station. * Some other common stunting collages consists of construction site noises (sawing, hammering, etc.), signaling the building of a new station; two examples are this are WZNN/Green Bay, WI (which transitioned to alternative rock in March 2007) and KROI/Houston (which transitioned from gospel music to all-news radio in November 2011). * Multiple stations contain collages of nature sounds, such as WHTI in Lakeside, Virginia for example, which switched from Mainstream Top-40 to Soft Adult Contemporary in May 2014; and other stations in America including Canada contain collages with the sound of a heartbeat, such as KTMT- FM in Medford, Oregon in March 2011 which flipped from Adult Top-40 to a CHR format, and Seattle's KMBX which led into a switch to rhythmic oldies in October 2000. * The collage may include sounds of a test pattern tone, an explosion (to \\"blow up\\" the previous format), or the sound of a flat-lining and/or beating heart rate monitor (signifying the death of one format and the birth of another). A classic example of this occurred when KLSX/Los Angeles transitioned from hot talk to CHR in February 2009. The \\"explosion\\" was provided by The Tom Leykis Show upon its conclusion and cancellation (fittingly, the show's slogan was \\"Blow me up, Tom!\\"), followed by the sound of a flatlining and beating monitor, with a 3-minute montage of Top 40 acts and LA-centric soundbites leading up into the launch of the new Top 40 format (as KAMP-FM). = Other = * One of the most well-known stunts comes from Tampa, Florida's former oldies station WFLZ during the middle of September 1989, known as Z-93, had multiple stunts for a week with various oldies and a few Top-40 songs mixed in as a soft launch of its new CHR station but still kept the name Z-93 during the stunting week. WFLZ's former oldies format was later then move to WYUU on the day before WFLZ's switch. The stunt begins with a fake Emergency Broadcast System test entitled the Emergency Boogie System in which the attention signal contains music clips from various Top-40 songs from the year prior and around the time in which had a more rock connection. The end of the test concludes with a message referring to \\"kick Q105 in the butt\\". It is due to WRBQ Q105 trying to be the only Top-40 station in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area by paying $4 million ransom. The station ignored the ransom demands from WFLZ and it's competitor started to mock and belittle Q105. Later on, the aspect of the station's campaigns to make fun of Q105 at the time is by placing WFLZ's \\"Screw The Q\\" billboards all over Tampa. Some other stunt examples WFLZ made prior to its launch as a CHR station contains a fake ABC World News report and an hour of urban contemporary micro-format. This also includes a few other Q-105 belittling mocks such as a Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? parody entitled Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Q?. The conclusion of the station's stunt ends with sound effects of a radio buzzing noise and various pigs squealing enable to bring its new format name Power 93 or The Power Pig on September 25th. * On October 2, 2009, following a half-hour retrospective marking the end of its smooth jazz format, WVMV/Detroit purportedly revived its previous Detroit's Wheels WLLZ branding as a classic rock station. However, in the midst of playing \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses, the song was interrupted by a sequence which led into a soft launch of its new CHR format, under the branding 98.7 Takeover. After a publicity campaign over the weekend (including listeners being asked to guess the station's new branding), WVMV officially launched its new format as 98.7 Amp Radio the following Monday. * On January 7, 2019, country station KSED/Sedona began stunting with a speaking clock counting down to 6:00 a.m. on January 14, 2019. The stunt‚Äîwhich led into a rebranding with no change in format‚Äîprompted the Flagstaff Police Department to issue a statement clarifying that, despite concerns from residents, this was a promotional event with no harm intended. * From March 27 to late-May 2020, CHR station WFLC/Miami, Hits 97.3, rebranded as Quarantine Radio. In adherence to the stay-at-home order issued by Florida due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all on-air personalities worked from home, and the station also broadcast commercial-free workout mixes at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily, hosted by the station's nighttime host. In late-May, the branding was dropped and the station promoted itself as being \\"under construction\\", before re-launching the Hits format on June 3 with a new on-air lineup. On television Cartoon Network has broadcast its share of stunts over the years, many on April Fools' Day. In 1997, it showed the Screwy Squirrel short \\"Happy- Go-Nutty\\" for 12 hours, repeated in a loop, with the tongue-in-cheek claim that Screwy had taken over the programming studio and would show nothing else. Numerous complaints were received about this particular event, generally fielded by Cartoon Network's cable providers, who had been left in the dark about the stunt. Likely because of the backlash, Cartoon Network has not shown such an unannounced stunt of this magnitude since. Meanwhile, Adult Swim (a programming block of Cartoon Network) has held a number of their own April Fools' programming stunts, such as promoting a television premiere of Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters before its theatrical release (in a comically-small picture-in-picture display over regularly-scheduled programming); airings of the Tommy Wiseau film The Room, one airing in 2012 being cut off by a then one-off revival of Cartoon Network's former anime block Toonami; and an airing of Toonami (now a sub-block of Adult Swim) with all programming presented in subtitled Japanese rather than an English dub. The stunts have sometimes included unannounced previews and premieres of new and existing series, such as additional episodes of Perfect Hair Forever after its supposed series finale, the third season premiere of Rick and Morty, and during the aforementioned Toonami in Japanese stunt, an unannounced world premiere of the first episode of FLCLs third season FLCL Alternative before its second season Progressive had even premiered in the U.S. yet. Nick Jr. Too, a sister to the British Nick Jr. channel, has occasionally aired long- term marathons of Peppa Pig, during which it has branded as \\"Nick Jr. Peppa\\". In a similar manner, Sky Sports has also temporarily rebranded some of its channels to devote them specifically to certain major events, such as The Ashes series in cricket (Sky Sports Ashes), the PDC World Darts Championship (Sky Sports Darts; in 2015, this used the Sky Sports F1 channel, since Formula One was in its off-season), and golf's Open Championship (Sky Sports The Open). In January 2019, Sky Sports Action was temporarily renamed \\"Sky Sports USA\\", with programming focusing on the National Basketball Association for the NBA Global Games series in London, and the National Football League playoffs and Super Bowl LIII. At least two networks have used stunting-type events prior to their formal launches: MLB Network, for example, aired a continuous loop of baseball highlights and promos as a \\"soft launch\\" in the weeks before its formal debut on January 1, 2009, while Canada's Sun News Network employed an on-screen countdown clock graphic in the hours before its April 18, 2011, launch. Since 2017, one of ESPN's networks has stunted as \\"ESPN8\\" on or near August 8 (8/8), carrying a marathon of programming featuring obscure and unconventional sporting events and competitions, such as chess boxing, disc golf, dodgeball, esports, Highland games, kabaddi, lawn mower racing, mini- golf, and roller derby. The stunt pays tribute to the fictitious portrayal of an eighth ESPN network in the 2004 sports comedy film DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story, nicknamed \\"The Ocho\\" (in reference to ESPN2 being nicknamed \\"The Deuce\\" on launch), which carried coverage of events that were \\"almost a sport\\". The stunt was originally held on ESPNU‚Äîa channel that normally carries college sports events during the academic year, but moved to ESPN2 beginning in 2018. DodgeBall has also been screened as part of this lineup since 2018.

Background DeFaria has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and a law degree from Osgoode Hall. He worked in criminal and constitutional law before entering political life. DeFaria was also an instructor of the Bar Admission Course for the Law Society of Upper Canada. His wife, Riina DeFaria, has also campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions. Politics He ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, as the Tory candidate in the working-class riding of Cambridge. He finished a distant third, behind prominent New Democrat Mike Farnan and a Liberal candidate. DeFaria then ran for the federal Progressive Conservative Party in the federal election of 1993 in Mississauga East, placing a distant third, this time behind Liberal Albina Guarnieri and a Reform Party candidate. He was elected in Mississauga East by more than 6,000 votes over his Liberal opponent in the provincial election of 1995, amid a Tory sweep of the Mississauga region. A moderate, DeFaria remained a backbencher during the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris. DeFaria was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating his Liberal opponent by more than 4,000 votes. He supported Ernie Eves to succeed Harris as party leader in 2002, and was named Minister of Citizenship with responsibility for Seniors on April 15, 2002. In late 2002, he was criticized by some for issuing a pamphlet of Christmas songs entitled \\"Sing Along With Carl\\". One of the works was a Stephen Foster song from 1851, which referred to blacks as \\"darkies\\". DeFaria quickly apologized, claiming that he had not scrutinized the pamphlet carefully enough before its release. In the provincial election of 2003, he lost to Liberal candidate Peter Fonseca (a well-known Olympic athlete) by about 3,000 votes, amid a general regional decline in Tory support. =Cabinet positions= Later life He ran for the Mississauga South federal Conservative nomination in 2004, losing to Phil Green.

The Vidiians are a fictional alien race in the Star Trek franchise. Developed by Star Trek: Voyager series' co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor, they serve as recurring antagonists during the show's first two seasons. They are represented as a nomadic species suffering from a pandemic known as the Phage, which destroys their tissue. A society with highly developed medical technology, the Vidiians harvest organs from corpses and living beings to stall the progression of the Phage, and experiment on other alien species in an attempt to develop a cure. Vidiian storylines frequently revolve around the aliens' attempts to take its Voyager crew members' organs, though a Vidiian scientist named Danara Pel serves as a love interest for The Doctor. The alien species have made minor appearances in the show's subsequent seasons, and have been included in novels set in the Star Trek universe. Inspired by the Maya civilization, the bubonic plague, and Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, the Vidiians were seen by the show's co-creators as a way to honor Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying well-developed antagonists in the Star Trek franchise. The Vidiians were presented as one of three new alien species that could be expanded as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Kazon and the Sikarians. The concept for the Phage as a bacteriophage was decided through a collaboration between science consultant Andr√© Bormanis and the show's producers. Michael Westmore was the primary make-up supervisor involved in the creation of the Vidiians' appearance. The make-up and prosthetics for the Vidiians were extensive, requiring actors to wear head masks, contacts, and dentures. The Vidiians received a generally positive response from critics who praised them as successfully bringing horror themes to the series. Susan Diol garnered positive reviews for her performance as Danara Pel.  Appearances  = Star Trek: Voyager = The Vidiians appear as recurring antagonists during Star Trek: Voyager first two seasons. The crew of the USS Voyager first encounters the alien species in the season one episode \\"Phage\\", in which the Talaxian Neelix (Ethan Phillips) has his lungs stolen by two Vidiians, Dereth (Cully Fredricksen) and Motura (Stephen Rappaport). After Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) pursues the Vidiians to recover Neelix's organs, the Vidiians explain that their entire species has been infected by a pandemic known as the Phage. They have developed advanced medical technology to remotely harvest organs directly from living humanoids in order to stop the progression of the Phage, which causes tissue to disintegrate on a cellular level. Motura informs Janeway that he has already implanted Neelix's lungs into his own body, but these cannot be removed without killing him, to which he agrees. Faced with a moral dilemma, Janeway refuses his offer and allows both Dereth and Motura to leave. She instructs them to tell the other Vidiians that any attempt to take another organ from Voyagers crew will be met with deadly force. Dereth and Motura perform an operation and adapt a lung from Kes (Jennifer Lien), an Ocampa and Neelix's romantic partner, to make for a compatible donation aligned with Neelix's physiology. They are able to successfully implant the lung into Neelix's body. In \\"Faces\\", Lieutenants Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Peter Durst (Brian Markinson) are kidnapped by the Vidiians. Paris and Durst are forced to work in mines while waiting to have their organs harvested. Vidiian Chief Surgeon Sulan (also played by Markinson) experiments on Torres to find a cure for the Phage, since her Klingon genetic structure has an immunity to the disease. The procedure splits Torres into two bodies (a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human); Sulan conducts further experiments on the Klingon Torres while the Human Torres is forced to work in the mines. Sulan kills Durst and grafts his face on top of his own. Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ), and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang), who had formed a search party to locate the missing crew members, but upon encountering armed guards are forced to turn back. Chakotay, however returns, now disguised as a Vidiian guard with the help of Tuvok and The Doctor (Robert Picardo), helps to rescue Torres; the Doctor combines both versions of Torres back together. During \\"Lifesigns\\", the crew responds to a distress call and attempts to help a Vidiian scientist Danara Pel (Susan Diol). The Doctor creates a holographic body for Pel in order to work with her to develop a cure for the Phage. Despite the Vidiians' mistreatment of Torres in \\"Faces\\", she eventually agrees to provide a sample of her Klingon DNA for their experiments. During their collaboration, the Doctor develops romantic feelings for Pel, and the pair go on a date in the holodeck. When Pel's condition deteriorates rapidly, she decides to stay in her new holographic body so that she can remain alive for several days with the Doctor, rather than return to her own Phage-ravaged body. The Doctor convinces Pel to transfer her consciousness back into her body and the couple dance before Pel departs Voyager. Vidiians make minor appearances in \\"Deadlock\\" and \\"Resolutions\\". In \\"Deadlock\\", Janeway orders Tom Paris to direct Voyager into a nebula to prevent detection from two nearby Vidiian planets. The starship and its crew are duplicated due to a space-time rift. Several Vidiians attack one of the copies of Voyager and harvest vital organs from members of its crew. The Janeway captaining the invaded ship stops the invasion by self-destructing the Voyager in question. This kills the Vidiians and the crew of that Voyager, excepting Harry Kim and the newborn Naomi Wildman; Kim and Wildman, their counterparts having died, change ships before the self-destruct completes. Pel returns in \\"Resolutions\\" to provide a cure for Janeway and Chakotay, who are infected with a terminal illness. Other Vidiians launch an ambush attack during the exchange, but Voyager manages to escape with the serum for Janeway and Chakotay. The Vidiians are referenced and seen in several subsequent episodes. In \\"Coda\\", Janeway finds herself caught in a time loop after a group of Vidiians kill her during an away mission. All of Janeway's experiences in the time loop, as well as her death, are explained to be the result of hallucinations caused by an alien disguised as the spirit of her dead father, Admiral Janeway (Len Cariou). In \\"Think Tank\\", Janeway learns that a cure for the Phage has been developed by a committee of alien intellectuals. The Vidiians make their final appearance during an alternative timeline in \\"Fury\\". During this episode, Kes returns to Voyager (she had left at the beginning of the fourth season when the development of her psionic powers threatened the starship and its crew). Kes has forgotten the reason for her earlier departure, blaming the crew for abandoning her. After traveling to the past, she contacts the Vidiians and tells them that she will help them commandeer Voyager if they escort her past self back to her home planet. The future version of Kes is killed by Janeway during the Vidiians' attack, and her past version makes a holographic message to prevent the events from occurring. The final mention of the Vidiians occurs in the season six episode \\"Good Shepherd\\" as one of the various alien species that have threatened Voyager in the past. = Other appearances = The Vidiians have appeared in original fiction based on the Star Trek franchise. For example, in Shadow of Heaven, Danara Pel is captured by an alien species, who desire vengeance against the Vidiians for their past organ-harvesting operations. Kes rescues Pel by using her psionic powers. In the alternative universe presented in the short story \\"Places of Exile\\", the Doctor and Pel are the ones who have created the cure for the Phage. In this interpretation, the Vidiians form a more diplomatic bond with Voyager crew and promise to help expedite their return to the Alpha Quadrant. Several pieces of merchandise related to the Vidiians were also released following their debut. In 1996, an action figure of a Vidiian was released as part of a second wave of Playmates Toys' Star Trek merchandise. A figure of a Vidiian starship was also released by WizKids. The Vidiians have not been featured in Star Trek Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), but a writer from Cryptic Studios presented in a 2013 article that they may be one potential alien species to be included in future updates.  History and culture  In the Star Trek universe, roughly 2,000 years prior to the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, the Vidiian Soladity was a culture driven by \\"educators, artists, and explorers\\".Okuda & Okuda & Mirek (1994) The book Star Trek: Star Charts identifies the Vidiians' homeworld as Vidiia Prime, the central planet of the Vidiia system and a Class M planet.Mandel (2002): p. 78 The spread of the Phage, resulting in thousands of Vidiians dying every day, pushed the alien race to harvest organs and tissue from corpses as well as living beings. The Vidiians developed advanced medical technology to counteract the spread and progression of the disease, such as their use of a \\"combined weapon, medical scanner, and surgical instrument\\" and knowledge of immunogenicity.Ruditis (2016) They also experimented on other alien species in an attempt to find a cure for the Phage. The Vidiians developed methods for interspecies organ transplants. Despite their technological advancements, this alien species is shown to be unfamiliar with holographic technology and engines powered by dilithium. The Vidiians' culture also shifts as a result of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an individual would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out of fear of contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work for them as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.  Background  = Concept and creation = The concept and design of the Vidiians was partially inspired by alt=A black-and-white image of Frankenstein's monster Prior to the announcement of a new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived of the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings.Poe (1998): p. 156 Taylor, Piller, and producer Brannon Braga developed the premise behind the Phage and the Vidiians' motives for harvesting organs from discussing ideas that fulfilled the following questions: \\"Who's interesting? What's interesting? What's an agenda we find interesting?\\" According to Taylor, the Vidiians were first imagined from an \\"idea of a culture that was dying of an incurable virus that would go to any lengths to make themselves and their species stay alive\\".Gross & Altman (1996): p. 137 Taylor originally envisioned the Vidiians as reminiscent of the Maya civilization, especially relative to practices of human sacrifice and cannibalism. Braga, however, has connected the alien species to European history, questioning if Europeans would have pursued similar methods if the bubonic plague had persisted as a pandemic. Braga stated that the Vidiians were partially inspired by Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, emphasizing that he wanted to portray them as sympathetic.\\"Braving the Unknown: Season 2\\". Star Trek: Voyager ‚Äì Season Two (DVD). Paramount. 2004. In his book Star Trek: Parallel Narratives, Chris Gregory attributes the development of the Vidiians to Braga's affinity for the horror genre.Gregory (2000) p. 94 During the writing and development of the episode \\"Faces\\", executive story editor Kenneth Biller had difficulty writing the primary Vidiian character as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: \\"[A]liens should never be patently evil. They may have a set of values that differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains.\\"Poe (1998): p. 135‚Äì136 Taylor used the following description to summarize the show's approach to the alien species:Initially called the \\"Phages\\", the show's producers changed the alien species' name to the \\"Vaphorans\\". Following the completion of the script for the debut episode, the species' name was revised again to \\"Vidiians\\" to prevent potential pronunciation issues for the cast.Ruditis (2003): p. 20 Introduced in the first season, the Vidiians were developed as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Kazon and the Sikarians. The Vidiians and the Kazon would be featured in later episodes, while the appearance of the Sikarians was restricted to the episode \\"Prime Factors\\".Poe (1998): p. 127 Through a collaboration with science consultant Andr√© Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature included on the DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species.\\"Real Science With Andre Bormanis\\". Star Trek: Voyager ‚Äì Season Two (DVD). Paramount. 2004. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of \\"an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive\\" as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: \\"Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance.\\"Ruditis (2003): p. 42 Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: \\"[E]ven though they knew what they were doing was wrong in terms of the actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs\\". = Design and casting = A mannequin is shown wearing the Vidiian prosthetic make-up at a alt=A mannequin wearing a face mask that resembles decomposing flesh and a grey body suit. The series' make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved in the creation of the Vidiians' look. Taylor worked closely with Westmore to ensure that the Vidiians bore no resemblance to previous alien species featured in the Star Trek franchise.Gross & Altman (1996): p. 151 According to Westmore, the script for the episode \\"Phage\\" called for the species to appear like \\"a race of people whose skin and organs were rotting\\". The series' make-up supervisors based the Vidiians' design on patchwork quilts, specifically in the way their bodies were composed of various harvested body parts and organs along with their own decomposing skin. Created as a mask covering the entirety of the actor's head, the prosthetic make-up includes pieces from other alien species, such as Talaxians and the Kazon, to represent the Vidiians' long history of taking organs from humanoids in multiple areas of the Delta Quadrant.Westmore, Sims, Look, & Birnes (2000): p. 167 Along with the mask, actors portraying Vidiians would wear contact lenses and dentures. Robert Beltran said he felt uncomfortable while acting in the facial mask during the filming of the disguised Chakotay in the \\"Faces\\". He described the prosthetic as giving him a \\"raw, wounded face, which made [him] feel very vulnerable as a person\\", and viewed it as an acting challenge. Following an extensive casting process, American actress Susan Diol was selected to play Danara Pel. Diol had previously appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Silicon Avatar\\" as engineer Carmen Davila. Robert Picardo praised her performance, noting that she \\"miraculously side-stepped all of the pitfalls of that role, which were abject pity\\". Taylor developed Danara Pel as way to explore the morality behind treating terminally ill individuals, while Picardo approached the character as a meditation on the role of physical appearance in romantic relationships. He explained his interpretation of the Doctor's romance with Pel:  Response  = Cast and crew response = The Vidiians' debut in \\"Phage\\" received primarily positive responses from Voyager's cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised the moment in which Janeway had to choose between \\"sacrificing Neelix's lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive\\". She viewed Janeway's initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of \\"poignancy\\".Ruditis (2003): p. 43 While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of Voyager, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as \\"the most interesting ones that we've run into as far as a new concept and look, and something totally different\\", highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore's work representing the Vidiians as \\"truly grisly- looking people\\" without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they \\"just seemed very wimpy to me, even though they were saying the same dialogue I had written\\". The series' producers and writers also commented on the inclusion of the Vidiians in the episode \\"Faces\\". Piller, Braga, and Taylor praised executive producer Rick Berman's decision to reformat the Torres' storyline with the inclusion of the Vidiians. Dent was impressed by the episode's representation of the alien species, and felt it was an improvement over her initial concepts.Gross & Altman (1996): p. 145‚Äì146 While discussing the representation of the Vidiians, Biller highlighted the scene in which Vidiian scientist Sulan transplants the face of Lieutenant Peter Durst (also played by Markinson) onto his own, and referred to it as \\"my classic moment in Voyager first season\\".Gross & Altman (1996): p. 146 = Critical reception = The Vidiians have received positive feedback from television critics. Marc Buxton of the website Den of Geek! included the Vidiians on his list of the 50 best alien life forms in the Star Trek universe, describing them as \\"Wes Craven nightmares\\". While commenting on the episode \\"Lifesigns\\", TrekToday Michelle Erica Green questioned the show's decision to focus on the Kazon and described the Vidiians as a more suitable and compelling candidate to serve as the primary antagonists for the first two seasons. Today's Ree Hines called the Vidiians one of the greatest Star Trek villains, writing that \\"their method of organ extraction upped the fear factor\\" and made them unsympathetic. Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer's Reviews commended the development of the Vidiians in \\"Faces\\", writing that they were portrayed as complex villains. Even though he felt that the Vidiians had a compelling premise, he criticized their repeated appearances as distracting from the series' story arc of a lost crew on a journey home. Juliette Harrison of Den of Geek! ranked Susan Diol's performance as Danara Pel as one of the top ten guest performances on Star Trek: Voyager. Pel's storyline was praised by Harrison as portraying \\"the on-going effects of chronic illness on the sufferer's sense of self\\"; for Harrison, Diol approached the role through \\"carefully understated but heartfelt reactions to her situation\\". =Academic analysis= A number of academics have identified the Vidiians as potentially adversely influencing public knowledge and perceptions of scientific issues, including genetics and organ donation. Clarence Spiger and colleagues, in a study of student perceptions of organ donations, highlighted the Vidiians as an example of a problematic source of information about the topic on television, a medium which many participants had identified as a key source for their understanding. \\"We can only speculate\\", they wrote, \\"that students' responses could have been indirectly or subconsciously influenced through the viewing of such programming.\\" Literary critic John Kenneth Muir wrote that the Vidiians were an example of the prevalence of organ harvesting story arcs in science fiction, comparing them to characters in the British television shows UFO, Space: 1999, and Blake's 7. He also questioned the connection between storylines such as the Vidiians to the spread of urban legends involving organ trafficking.Muir (2006) p. 107 In his 2016 The Politics of Star Trek, political scientist George A. Gonzalez argued that the Vidiians served as a critique of realpolitik. He described the alien species as built on an \\"intersubjective agreement that does not recognize the rights of others to their bodies/organs\\".Gonazalez (2015) Scholar Karin Blair interpreted the Doctor's dance with Pel, which she described as \\"the Vidiian 'collection of spare parts'\\", as one example of how Voyager focused on a \\"more bounded word, a stable dwelling or memories of home\\" as opposed to the emphasis on \\"pluralism and open-ended diversity\\" in Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation.Blair (1997) p. 87 Blair wrote that Pel provided a glimpse into the Vidiians' appearance prior to the Phage, noting that she had a stronger set of morals than the Vidiians featured in previous episodes.Blair (1997) p. 86  References  =Citations= =Book sources=    External links * Official Star Trek website * Category:Star Trek species Category:Television characters introduced in 1995 Category:Organ transplantation in fiction ","title":"Vidiians"},{"id":"1258047","text":"White Eyes, named Koquethagechton (c. 1730 ‚Äì 5 November 1778), was a leader of the Lenape (Delaware) people in the Ohio Country during the era of the American Revolution. Sometimes known as George White Eyes, or Captain Grey Eyes al. Sir William, his given name in Lenape was rendered in many spelling variations in colonial records.Wellenreuther, Hermann. \\"The Succession of Head Chiefs and the Delaware Culture of Consent: The Delaware Nation, David Zeisberger, and Modern Ethnography\\", In A. G. Roeber, ed., Ethnographies and Exchanges: Native Americans, Moravians, and Catholics in Early America. University Park, Pa.: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2008. 31‚Äì48. By 1773 he was Speaker of the Delaware Head Council and known as one of the most important councilors. White Eyes was a war chief and a tireless mediator in turbulent times, negotiating the first Indian treaties with the fledgling United States, and always working toward his ultimate goal of establishing a secure Indian territory. His murder by an American militia officer is believed to have been covered up by United States officials. Early life and education Nothing is known about the early life of Koquethagechton. Likely born in present-day Pennsylvania, he was first noted in the English colonial record near the end of the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War), as a messenger during treaty negotiations. He appeared to be considered well suited for interaction between Indians and whites, although he could not read or write, and probably did not speak English‚Äîat least not well. Migration and career After the war, when European colonists began settling near the Lenape villages around Fort Pitt in western Pennsylvania, the Native Americans moved further west to the Muskingum River valley in present-day eastern Ohio. By this time, many Lenape had converted to Christianity under the influence of Moravian missionaries and lived in villages led by these missionaries. The missionary towns also moved to the Muskingum, so that the Lenape, both Christian and non-Christian, could stay together. Though not a Christian, White Eyes ensured that the Christian Lenape remained members of the larger native community. In the early 1770s, Lenape attacked the Philip Doddridge family farm, killing some members of the nine-person extended family and capturing others. The Lenape took away three girls, a son, and the grandmother. The five-year-old girl Rachel Doddridge was known to have been adopted into the tribe. Marriage and family After becoming a chief, White Eyes married Rachel Doddridge (d. 1788), a young English colonist who had been taken captive as a 5-year-old child during a Lenape raid and adopted into the Lenape people, becoming fully assimilated. They had at least one son, named George Morgan White Eyes. Rachel had been living with her father Philip Doddridge and family at a farm on the shores of Chartier's Creek near Statler's Fort (Washington County, Pennsylvania). Her cousin Philip Doddridge reported seeing her later as an adult at a trading post. Thoroughly assimilated by then, she was not interested in a reunion with her British relatives.Huff, Earle, and Winifred Huff Wiegand, The Doddridge Family in England and America; early records from AD 700. 1961. Town in Ohio White Eyes established his own town, known by the colonists as White Eyes' Town, near the Lenape capital of Coshocton, Ohio. By 1773 White Eyes served as Speaker of the Delaware Head Council, an important position and indication of his high reputation in the tribe. In 1774, the Lenape Grand Council, an association of chiefs, named White Eyes as principal chief of the nation. In the early 1770s, violence on the frontier between whites and Indians threatened to escalate into open warfare. White Eyes unsuccessfully attempted to prevent what would become Lord Dunmore's War in 1774, fought primarily between the Shawnee and Virginia colonists. He served as a peace emissary between the two armies, and helped negotiate a treaty to end the war. Revolution and death General Lachlan McIntosh When the American Revolutionary War began soon after the end of Dunmore's War, White Eyes was negotiating a royal grant with Lord Dunmore to secure the Lenape territory in the Ohio Country. After the American revolutionaries forced Dunmore out of Virginia, White Eyes had to begin anew with the Americans. In April 1776, he addressed the Continental Congress in Philadelphia on behalf of the Lenape. Two years later he completed an alliance of the Delaware with the United States by a treaty signed in 1778 at Fort Pitt. It promised to establish a Lenape state, with representation in the American Congress, provided that the Congress approved. The treaty provided for the Lenape to serve as guides for the Americans when they moved through the Ohio Country to strike at their British and Indian enemies to the north, in and around Detroit. In early November 1778, White Eyes joined an American expedition under General Lachlan McIntosh as a guide and negotiator. Soon after, the Americans reported that White Eyes had contracted smallpox and died during the expedition. After his death, the Lenape alliance with the Americans eventually collapsed. The Americans by then had no interest in supporting a state under Lenape control. After his death, Gelelemend of the Turtle Clan became the principal chief of the Lenape as no other leader was qualified by clan. Assassination claim Years later, George Morgan, a US Indian agent, trader, and former close associate of White Eyes, wrote a letter to Congress claiming that the chief had been \\"treacherously put to death\\" by American militia in Michigan. Later documentation affirmed that White Eyes had been killed by an American militia officer on November 5, 1778. (Morgan had helped negotiate with Native Americans in the Fort Pitt area, so was closely involved in these matters.) He also wrote that the murder of White Eyes had been covered up to prevent the Lenape from abandoning the revolutionaries. White Eyes' British-Lenape wife Rachel Doddridge was reportedly murdered by white men in 1788. Their mixed- race son George Morgan White Eyes (1770?‚Äì1798) was cared for by the family friend George Morgan. Later he was educated at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), where his tuition was paid by the Continental Congress. He graduated in 1789.\\"Brief History of Students of Color at Princeton\\" , Thriving at Princeton, 2007‚Äì08, July 2007, Princeton University Legacy and honors *White Eyes Township in Coshocton County, Ohio was named after the chief as a tribute to his leadership and building an alliance with the revolutionaries.

The unprotected amine of one reacts with the unprotected carboxylic acid group of the other to form a peptide bond. In this example, the second reactive group (amine/acid) in each of the starting materials bears a protecting group. In organic chemistry, peptide synthesis is the production of peptides, compounds where multiple amino acids are linked via amide bonds, also known as peptide bonds. Peptides are chemically synthesized by the condensation reaction of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. Protecting group strategies are usually necessary to prevent undesirable side reactions with the various amino acid side chains. Chemical peptide synthesis most commonly starts at the carboxyl end of the peptide (C-terminus), and proceeds toward the amino- terminus (N-terminus). Protein biosynthesis (long peptides) in living organisms occurs in the opposite direction. The chemical synthesis of peptides can be carried out using classical solution-phase techniques, although these have been replaced in most research and development settings by solid-phase methods (see below). Solution-phase synthesis retains its usefulness in large- scale production of peptides for industrial purposes however. Chemical synthesis facilitates the production of peptides which are difficult to express in bacteria, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, peptide/protein backbone modification, and the synthesis of D-proteins, which consist of D-amino acids. Solid-phase synthesis The established method for the production of synthetic peptides in the lab is known as solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Pioneered by Robert Bruce Merrifield, SPPS allows the rapid assembly of a peptide chain through successive reactions of amino acid derivatives on an insoluble porous support. The solid support consists of small, polymeric resin beads functionalized with reactive groups (such as amine or hydroxyl groups) that link to the nascent peptide chain. Since the peptide remains covalently attached to the support throughout the synthesis, excess reagents and side products can be removed by washing and filtration. This approach circumvents the comparatively time-consuming isolation of the product peptide from solution after each reaction step, which would be required when using conventional solution-phase synthesis. Each amino acid to be coupled to the peptide chain N-terminus must be protected on its N-terminus and side chain using appropriate protecting groups such as Boc (acid-labile) or Fmoc (base-labile), depending on the side chain and the protection strategy used (see below). The general SPPS procedure is one of repeated cycles of alternate N-terminal deprotection and coupling reactions. The resin can be washed between each steps. First an amino acid is coupled to the resin. Subsequently, the amine is deprotected, and then coupled with the free acid of the second amino acid. This cycle repeats until the desired sequence has been synthesized. SPPS cycles may also include capping steps which block the ends of unreacted amino acids from reacting. At the end of the synthesis, the crude peptide is cleaved from the solid support while simultaneously removing all protecting groups using a reagent strong acids like trifluoroacetic acid or a nucleophile. The crude peptide can be precipitated from a non-polar solvent like diethyl ether in order to remove organic soluble by products. The crude peptide can be purified using reversed-phase HPLC. The purification process, especially of longer peptides can be challenging, because small amounts of several byproducts, which are very similar to the product, have to be removed. For this reason so-called continuous chromatography processes such as MCSGP are increasingly being used in commercial settings to maximize the yield without sacrificing on purity levels. SPPS is limited by reaction yields, and typically peptides and proteins in the range of 70 amino acids are pushing the limits of synthetic accessibility. Synthetic difficulty also is sequence dependent; typically aggregation-prone sequences such as amyloids are difficult to make. Longer lengths can be accessed by using ligation approaches such as native chemical ligation, where two shorter fully deprotected synthetic peptides can be joined together in solution. =Peptide coupling reagents= An important feature that has enabled the broad application of SPPS is the generation of extremely high yields in the coupling step. Highly efficient amide bond-formation conditions are required.To illustrate the impact of suboptimal coupling yields for a given synthesis, consider the case where each coupling step were to have at least 99% yield: this would result in a 77% overall crude yield for a 26-amino acid peptide (assuming 100% yield in each deprotection); if each coupling were 95% efficient, the overall yield would be 25%. and adding an excess of each amino acid (between 2- and 10-fold). The minimization of amino acid racemization during coupling is also of vital importance to avoid epimerization in the final peptide product. Amide bond formation between an amine and carboxylic acid is slow, and as such usually requires 'coupling reagents' or 'activators'. A wide range of coupling reagents exist, due in part to their varying effectivness for particular couplings, many of these reagents are commercially available. Carbodiimides Amide bond formation using DIC/HOBt. Carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) are frequently used for amide bond formation. The reaction proceeds via the formation of a highly reactive O-acylisourea. This reactive intermediate is attacked by the peptide N-terminal amine, forming a peptide bond. Formation of the O-acylisourea proceeds fastest in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. DIC is particularly useful for SPPS since as a liquid it is easily dispensed, and the urea byproduct is easily washed away. Conversely, the related carbodiimide 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) is often used for solution-phase peptide couplings as its urea byproduct can be removed by washing during aqueous work-up. HOBt HOAt Neighbouring group effect of HOAt Carbodiimide activation opens the possibility for racemization of the activated amino acid. Racemization can be circumvented with 'racemization suppressing' additives such as the triazoles 1-hydroxy- benzotriazole (HOBt), and 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole (HOAt). These reagents attack the O-acylisourea intermediate to form an active ester, which subsequently reacts with the peptide to form the desired peptide bond. Ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma), an additive for carbodiimide coupling, acts as an alternative to HOAt. Aminium/uronium and phosphonium salts Uronium-based peptide coupling reagents Some coupling reagents omit the carbodiimide completely and incorporate the HOAt/HOBt moiety as an aminium/uronium or phosphonium salt of a non-nucleophilic anion (tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate). Examples of aminium/uronium reagents include HATU (HOAt), HBTU/TBTU (HOBt) and HCTU (6-ClHOBt). HBTU and TBTU differ only in the choice of anion. Phosphonium reagents include PyBOP (HOBt) and PyAOP (HOAt). These reagents form the same active ester species as the carbodiimide activation conditions, but differ in the rate of the initial activation step, which is determined by nature of the carbon skeleton of the coupling reagent. Furthermore, aminium/uronium reagents are capable of reacting with the peptide N-terminus to form an inactive guanidino by-product, whereas phosphonium reagents are not.  Propanephosphonic acid anhydride  Since late 2000s, propanephosphonic acid anhydride, sold commercially under various names such as \\"T3P\\", has become a useful reagent for amide bond formation in commercial applications. It converts the oxygen of the carboxylic acid into a leaving group, whose peptide-coupling byproducts are water soluble and can be easily washed away. In a performance comparison between propanephosphonic acid anhydride and other peptide coupling reagents for the preparation of a nonapeptide drug, it was found that this reagent was superior to other reagents with regards to yield and low epimerization.J. Hiebl et al, J. Pept. Res. (1999), 54, 54 =Solid supports= Cross-linked polystyrene is the most common solid support used in SPPS. Solid supports for peptide synthesis are selected for physically stability, to permit the rapid filtration of liquids. Suitable supports are inert to reagents and solvents used during SPPS, although they must swell in the solvents used to allow for penetration of the reagents, and allow for the attachment of the first amino acid. Three primary types of solid supports are: gel-type supports, surface- type supports, and composites. Improvements to solid supports used for peptide synthesis enhance their ability to withstand the repeated use of TFA during the deprotection step of SPPS. Two primary resins are used, based on whether a C-terminal carboxylic acid or amide is desired. The Wang resin was, , the most commonly used resin for peptides with C-terminal carboxylic acids. =Protecting groups schemes= As described above, the use of N-terminal and side chain protecting groups is essential during peptide synthesis to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as self-coupling of the activated amino acid leading to (polymerization). This would compete with the intended peptide coupling reaction, resulting in low yield or even complete failure to synthesize the desired peptide. Two principle orthogonal protecting group schemes exist for use in solid-phase peptide synthesis: so-called Boc/Bzl and Fmoc/tBu approaches. The Boc/Bzl strategy utilizes TFA-labile N-terminal Boc protection alongside side chain protection that is removed using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride during the final cleavage step (with simultaneous cleavage of the peptide from the solid support). Fmoc/tBu SPPS uses base-labile Fmoc N-terminal protection, with side chain protection and a resin linkage that are acid-labile (final acidic cleavage is carried out via TFA treatment). Both approaches, including the advantages and disadvantages of each, are outlined in more detail below. Boc/Bzl SPPS Cleavage of the Boc group The original method for peptide synthesis relied on tert-butyloxycarbonyl (or more simply 'Boc') as a temporary N-terminal Œ±-amino protecting group. The Boc group is removed with acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This forms a positively charged amino group in the presence of excess TFA (note that the amino group is not protonated in the image on the right), which is neutralized and coupled to the incoming activated amino acid. Neutralization can either occur prior to coupling or in situ during the basic coupling reaction. The Boc/Bzl approach retains its usefulness in reducing peptide aggregation during synthesis. In addition, Boc/Bzl SPPS may be preferred over the Fmoc/tBu approach when synthesizing peptides containing base-sensitive moieties (such as depsipeptides), as treatment with base is required during the Fmoc deprotection step (see below). Permanent side-chain protecting groups used during Boc/Bzl SPPS are typically benzyl or benzyl-based groups. Final removal of the peptide from the solid support occurs simultaneously with side chain deprotection using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride via hydrolytic cleavage. The final product is a fluoride salt which is relatively easy to solubilize. Scavengers such as cresol must be added to the HF in order to prevent reactive t-butyl cations from generating undesired products. A disadvantage of this approach is the potential for degradation of the peptide by hydrogen fluoride. Fmoc/tBu SPPS Cleavage of the Fmoc group. Treatment of the Fmoc- protected amine with piperidine results in proton abstraction from the methine group of the fluorenyl ring system. This leads to release of a carbamate, which decomposes into carbon dioxide (CO2) and the free amine. Dibenzofulvene is also generated. This reaction is able to occur due to the acidity of the fluorenyl proton, resulting from stabilization of the aromatic anion formed. The dibenzofulvene by-product can react with nucleophiles such as the piperidine (which is in large excess), or potentially the released amine. The use of N-terminal Fmoc protection allows for a milder deprotection scheme than used for Boc/Bzl SPPS, and this protection scheme is truly orthogonal under SPPS conditions. Fmoc deprotection utilizes a base, typically 20‚Äì50% piperidine in DMF. The exposed amine is therefore neutral, and consequently no neutralization of the peptide-resin is required, as in the case of the Boc/Bzl approach. The lack of electrostatic repulsion between the peptide chains can lead to increased risk of aggregation with Fmoc/tBu SPPS however. Because the liberated fluorenyl group is a chromophore, Fmoc deprotection can be monitored by UV absorbance of the reaction mixture, a strategy which is employed in automated peptide synthesizers. The ability of the Fmoc group to be cleaved under relatively mild basic conditions while being stable to acid allows the use of side chain protecting groups such as Boc and tBu that can be removed in milder acidic final cleavage conditions (TFA) than those used for final cleavage in Boc/Bzl SPPS (HF). Scavengers such as water and triisopropylsilane (TIPS) are added during the final cleavage in order to prevent side reactions with reactive cationic species released as a result of side chain deprotection. The resulting crude peptide is obtained as a TFA salt, which is potentially more difficult to solubilize than the fluoride salts generated in Boc SPPS. Fmoc/tBu SPPS is less atom-economical, as the fluorenyl group is much larger than the Boc group. Accordingly, prices for Fmoc amino acids were high until the large-scale piloting of one of the first synthesized peptide drugs, enfuvirtide, began in the 1990s, when market demand adjusted the relative prices of Fmoc- vs Boc- amino acids. Other protecting groups =Benzyloxy-carbonyl= The (Z) group is another carbamate-type amine protecting group, first used by Max Bergmann in the synthesis of oligopeptides. It is removed under harsh conditions using HBr in acetic acid, or milder conditions of catalytic hydrogenation. While it has been used periodically for Œ±-amine protection in peptide synthesis, it is almost exclusively used for side chain protection. =Alloc and miscellaneous groups= The allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) protecting group is sometimes used to protect an amino group (or carboxylic acid or alcohol group) when an orthogonal deprotection scheme is required. It is also sometimes used when conducting on-resin cyclic peptide formation, where the peptide is linked to the resin by a side-chain functional group. The Alloc group can be removed using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). For special applications like synthetic steps involving protein microarrays, protecting groups sometimes termed \\"lithographic\\" are used, which are amenable to photochemistry at a particular wavelength of light, and so which can be removed during lithographic types of operations. Regioselective disulfide bond formation The formation of multiple native disulfides remains challenging of native peptide synthesis by solid-phase methods. Random chain combination typically results in several products with nonnative disulfide bonds. Stepwise formation of disulfide bonds is typically the preferred method, and performed with thiol protecting groups. Different thiol protecting groups provide multiple dimensions of orthogonal protection. These orthogonally protected cysteines are incorporated during the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide. Successive removal of these groups, to allow for selective exposure of free thiol groups, leads to disulfide formation in a stepwise manner. The order of removal of the groups must be considered so that only one group is removed at a time. Thiol protecting groups used in peptide synthesis requiring later regioselective disulfide bond formation must possess multiple characteristics. First, they must be reversible with conditions that do not affect the unprotected side chains. Second, the protecting group must be able to withstand the conditions of solid-phase synthesis. Third, the removal of the thiol protecting group must be such that it leaves intact other thiol protecting groups, if orthogonal protection is desired. That is, the removal of PG A should not affect PG B. Some of the thiol protecting groups commonly used include the acetamidomethyl (Acm), tert-butyl (But), 3-nitro-2-pyridine sulfenyl (NPYS), 2-pyridine-sulfenyl (Pyr), and trityl (Trt) groups. Importantly, the NPYS group can replace the Acm PG to yield an activated thiol. Using this method, Kiso and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of insulin in 1993. In this work, the A-chain of insulin was prepared with following protecting groups in place on its cysteines: CysA6(But), CysA7(Acm), and CysA11(But), leaving CysA20 unprotected. Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis has been used to complete long peptide sequences with high degrees of yield and low degrees of racemization. Synthesizing long peptides Stepwise elongation, in which the amino acids are connected step-by-step in turn, is ideal for small peptides containing between 2 and 100 amino acid residues. Another method is fragment condensation, in which peptide fragments are coupled. Although the former can elongate the peptide chain without racemization, the yield drops if only it is used in the creation of long or highly polar peptides. Fragment condensation is better than stepwise elongation for synthesizing sophisticated long peptides, but its use must be restricted in order to protect against racemization. Fragment condensation is also undesirable since the coupled fragment must be in gross excess, which may be a limitation depending on the length of the fragment. A new development for producing longer peptide chains is chemical ligation: unprotected peptide chains react chemoselectively in aqueous solution. A first kinetically controlled product rearranges to form the amide bond. The most common form of native chemical ligation uses a peptide thioester that reacts with a terminal cysteine residue. Other methods applicable for covalently linking polypeptides in aqueous solution include the use of split inteins, spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and sortase ligation. In order to optimize synthesis of long peptides, a method was developed in Medicon Valley for converting peptide sequences. The simple pre-sequence (e.g. Lysine (Lysn); Glutamic Acid (Glun); (LysGlu)n) that is incorporated at the C-terminus of the peptide to induce an alpha-helix-like structure. This can potentially increase biological half- life, improve peptide stability and inhibit enzymatic degradation without altering pharmacological activity or profile of action. Cyclic peptides =On resin cyclization= Peptides can be cyclized on a solid support. A variety of cyclization reagents can be used such as HBTU/HOBt/DIEA, PyBop/DIEA, PyClock/DIEA. Head-to-tail peptides can be made on the solid support. The deprotection of the C-terminus at some suitable point allows on- resin cyclization by amide bond formation with the deprotected N-terminus. Once cyclization has taken place, the peptide is cleaved from resin by acidolysis and purified. The strategy for the solid-phase synthesis of cyclic peptides in not limited to attachment through Asp, Glu or Lys side chains. Cysteine has a very reactive sulfhydryl group on its side chain. A disulfide bridge is created when a sulfur atom from one Cysteine forms a single covalent bond with another sulfur atom from a second cysteine in a different part of the protein. These bridges help to stabilize proteins, especially those secreted from cells. Some researchers use modified cysteines using S-acetomidomethyl (Acm) to block the formation of the disulfide bond but preserve the cysteine and the protein's original primary structure. =Off- resin cyclization= Off-resin cyclization is a solid-phase synthesis of key intermediates, followed by the key cyclization in solution phase, the final deprotection of any masked side chains is also carried out in solution phase. This has the disadvantages that the efficiencies of solid-phase synthesis are lost in the solution phase steps, that purification from by-products, reagents and unconverted material is required, and that undesired oligomers can be formed if macrocycle formation is involved. The use of pentafluorophenyl esters (FDPP, PFPOH) and BOP-Cl are useful for cyclising peptides.

A gradient is represented by the different concentration of ions on either side of the membrane. The open conformation of the ion channel allows for the translocation of ions across the cell membrane, while the closed conformation does not. Voltage-gated ion channels are a class of transmembrane proteins that form ion channels that are activated by changes in the electrical membrane potential near the channel. The membrane potential alters the conformation of the channel proteins, regulating their opening and closing. Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions, thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels. They have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues, allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change. Found along the axon and at the synapse, voltage-gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals. Voltage-gated ion-channels are usually ion-specific, and channels specific to sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl‚àí) ions have been identified. The opening and closing of the channels are triggered by changing ion concentration, and hence charge gradient, between the sides of the cell membrane. Structure Conformation of the four homologous domains showing the formation of a central pore Voltage-gated ion channels are generally composed of several subunits arranged in such a way that there is a central pore through which ions can travel down their electrochemical gradients. The channels tend to be ion-specific, although similarly sized and charged ions may sometimes travel through them. The functionality of voltage-gated ion channels is attributed to its three main discrete units: the voltage sensor, the pore or conducting pathway, and the gate. Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels are composed of four transmembrane domains arranged around a central pore; these four domains are part of a single Œ±-subunit in the case of most Na+ and Ca2+ channels, whereas there are four Œ±-subunits, each contributing one transmembrane domain, in most K+ channels. The membrane-spanning segments, designated S1-S6, all take the form of alpha helices with specialized functions. The fifth and sixth transmembrane segments (S5 and S6) and pore loop serve the principal role of ion conduction, comprising the gate and pore of the channel, while S1-S4 serve as the voltage- sensing region. The four subunits may be identical, or different from one another. In addition to the four central Œ±-subunits, there are also regulatory Œ≤-subunits, with oxidoreductase activity, which are located on the inner surface of the cell membrane and do not cross the membrane, and which are coassembled with the Œ±-subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mechanism Crystallographic structural studies of a potassium channel have shown that, when a potential difference is introduced over the membrane, the associated electric field induces a conformational change in the potassium channel. The conformational change distorts the shape of the channel proteins sufficiently such that the cavity, or channel, opens to allow influx or efflux to occur across the membrane. This movement of ions down their concentration gradients subsequently generates an electric current sufficient to depolarize the cell membrane. Voltage-gated sodium channels and calcium channels are made up of a single polypeptide with four homologous domains. Each domain contains 6 membrane spanning alpha helices. One of these helices, S4, is the voltage sensing helix. The S4 segment contains many positive charges such that a high positive charge outside the cell repels the helix, keeping the channel in its closed state. In general, the voltage sensing portion of the ion channel is responsible for the detection of changes in transmembrane potential that trigger the opening or closing of the channel. The S1-4 alpha helices are generally thought to serve this role. In potassium and sodium channels, voltage-sensing S4 helices contain positively-charged lysine or arginine residues in repeated motifs. In its resting state, half of each S4 helix is in contact with the cell cytosol. Upon depolarization, the positively-charged residues on the S4 domains move toward the exoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is thought that the first 4 arginines account for the gating current, moving toward the extracellular solvent upon channel activation in response to membrane depolarization. The movement of 10‚Äì12 of these protein-bound positive charges triggers a conformational change that opens the channel. The exact mechanism by which this movement occurs is not currently agreed upon, however the canonical, transporter, paddle, and twisted models are examples of current theories. Movement of the voltage-sensor triggers a conformational change of the gate of the conducting pathway, controlling the flow of ions through the channel. The main functional part of the voltage-sensitive protein domain of these channels generally contains a region composed of S3b and S4 helices, known as the \\"paddle\\" due to its shape, which appears to be a conserved sequence, interchangeable across a wide variety of cells and species. A similar voltage sensor paddle has also been found in a family of voltage sensitive phosphatases in various species. Genetic engineering of the paddle region from a species of volcano-dwelling archaebacteria into rat brain potassium channels results in a fully functional ion channel, as long as the whole intact paddle is replaced. This \\"modularity\\" allows use of simple and inexpensive model systems to study the function of this region, its role in disease, and pharmaceutical control of its behavior rather than being limited to poorly characterized, expensive, and/or difficult to study preparations. Although voltage-gated ion channels are typically activated by membrane depolarization, some channels, such as inward-rectifier potassium ion channels, are activated instead by hyperpolarization. The gate is thought to be coupled to the voltage sensing regions of the channels and appears to contain a mechanical obstruction to ion flow. While the S6 domain has been agreed upon as the segment acting as this obstruction, its exact mechanism is unknown. Possible explanations include: the S6 segment makes a scissor-like movement allowing ions to flow through, the S6 segment breaks into two segments allowing of passing of ions through the channel, or the S6 channel serving as the gate itself. The mechanism by which the movement of the S4 segment affects that of S6 is still unknown, however it is theorized that there is a S4-S5 linker whose movement allows the opening of S6. Inactivation of ion channels occurs within milliseconds after opening. Inactivation is thought to be mediated by an intracellular gate that controls the opening of the pore on the inside of the cell. This gate is modeled as a ball tethered to a flexible chain. During inactivation, the chain folds in on itself and the ball blocks the flow of ions through the channel. Fast inactivation is directly linked to the activation caused by intramembrane movements of the S4 segments, though the mechanism linking movement of S4 and the engagement of the inactivation gate is unknown. Different types =Sodium (Na+) channels= Sodium channels have similar functional properties across many different cell types. While ten human genes encoding for sodium channels have been identified, their function is typically conserved between species and different cell types. =Calcium (Ca2+) channels= With sixteen different identified genes for human calcium channels, this type of channel differs in function between cell types. Ca2+ channels produce action potentials similarly to Na+ channels in some neurons. They also play a role in neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic nerve endings. In most cells, Ca2+ channels regulate a wide variety of biochemical processes due to their role in controlling intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. =Potassium (K+) channels= Potassium channels are the largest and most diverse class of voltage-gated channels, with over 100 encoding human genes. These types of channels differ significantly in their gating properties; some inactivating extremely slowly and others inactivating extremely quickly. This difference in activation time influences the duration and rate of action potential firing, which has a significant effect on electrical conduction along an axon as well as synaptic transmission. Potassium channels differ in structure from the other channels in that they contain four separate polypeptide subunits, while the other channels contain four homologous domain but on a single polypeptide unit. =Chloride (Cl‚àí) channels= Chloride channels are present in all types of neurons. With the chief responsibility of controlling excitability, chloride channels contribute to the maintenance of cell resting potential and help to regulate cell volume. =Proton (H+) channels= Voltage-gated proton channels carry currents mediated by hydrogen ions in the form of hydronium, and are activated by depolarization in a pH-dependent manner. They function to remove acid from cells.  Phylogenetics  Phylogenetic studies of proteins expressed in bacteria revealed the existence of a superfamily of voltage-gated sodium channels. Subsequent studies have shown that a variety of other ion channels and transporters are phylogenetically related to the voltage-gated ion channels, including inwardly rectifying K+ channels, ryanodine-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor Ca2+ channels, transient receptor potential Ca2+ channels, polycystin cation channels, glutamate-gated ion channels, calcium- dependent chloride channels, monovalent cation:proton antiporters, type 1, and potassium transporters.

The acronym RETAIN stands for Remote Technical Assistance Information Network.  Predecessor system  Historically, two different, but similar, systems were called RETAIN. The first, dating to the mid-1960s was a system that provided technical information to people in the IBM Field Engineering Division in the form of short bulletins or tips, organized according to machine type number or, for software, according to software component ID number. This information was accessible using simple query commands from IBM service branch office terminals. The terminals supported by this early RETAIN system were typewriter-type terminals, such as the IBM 2740. These same terminals were also used to access the IBM Field Instruction System (FIS), which provided education in the form of programmed instruction courseware. The RETAIN system was built on the same software framework as that of FIS. In fact, most of the early support for RETAIN was actually written in the language of a \\"course\\". The system was primarily used to provide field support for the System/360 family of mainframe systems, although it was used also to disseminate some technical information on other older systems.  RETAIN/370  In 1970, concurrent with the announcement of System/370, the next generation of mainframes after System/360, a new system was announced, called RETAIN/370. This system was designed for use by special Technical Support Centers located in regional centers, rather than by the branch office. This new system was designed to support display terminals, rather than the old typewriter-based ones. A special version of the 2915 display, originally designed for the airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, was used. The 2915 was a small keyboard-display driven by a large electronic controller and data interchange unit, the IBM 2948. Each 2948 supported up to 31 display terminals, which had to be located within a few hundred feet. The cost of this display system, with its large controller, prevented the 2915 terminals from being utilized in branch offices. Thus, the use of regional support centers for this system. The older RETAIN system continued to be used for several years afterwards, running in parallel with RETAIN/370, still providing direct support to branch-office terminals. It was sometimes called the \\"RETAIN/360\\" system, although that designation was never formalized. In time, after RETAIN/370 became available via 3270 terminals in the branch offices, the old RETAIN system was phased out, and RETAIN/370 was renamed to simply RETAIN. = Search engine = RETAIN/370 ran special applications designed for technical support center use. Its most powerful feature was a full-text search engine, enabling most text documents in the system to be retrieved by using boolean search requests, similar in concept to full-text search engines in use today on the Internet, such as Google or AltaVista, although limited only to searching for individual words, or combinations of words, without reference to word-adjacency. RETAIN/370 was the first IBM system deployed on a large scale that had such a capability. The search engine component of RETAIN is called IRIS, for Interpretive Retrieval Information System (not to be confused with other non- IBM software systems of that name... IBM never sold this search engine as a product, so there was no trademark issue). = Mirrored database = In the mid-1970s, a RETAIN was expanded to permit multiple copies of the database to be hosted on geographically distributed systems. RETAIN's custom-built Data Bank Manager, which served as the foundation for all RETAIN applications, and the IRIS search engine, was modified to support \\"mirroring\\" of file updates to take place automatically across the network, in a manner nearly invisible to the application programs, but which providing a high level of data integrity. After this change, RETAIN hosts were created in two US locations, two in Europe, two in South America, and two in Japan. Most applications were developed by IBM programmers in Raleigh, NC, (moved to Boulder, Colorado, in 1976) with some work being done in North Harbour, UK. Registered users of the system numbered in the thousands, in over 60 countries. = Remote support = At the time System/370 was announced, along with the corresponding RETAIN/370 system, IBM announced that the new family of computers would be equipped to permit remote diagnosis of hardware problems. Each System/370 installation of model 145 and above have a telecommunications adapter included capable of being used for remote support. The hardware diagnostic programs were written to allow control via a remote connection to applications on the RETAIN system that could be controlled by IBM specialists located at the IBM support center in Chicago, managed by Paul Rushton, and also including the original plant of manufacture of the CPU. This form of support was dubbed \\"Data Link / Hardware\\". The connection was made through a communications device called an IBM 2955 adapter, a stripped-down variant of the 2701 communications controller. It could connect at 600 bit/s to the RETAIN system to run diagnostics. Mainly, this was to run mostly the same diagnostics that could be run locally by an IBM CE, but in time other specialized applications were developed, such as programs to analyze \\"logouts\\" generated by hardware malfunctions, i.e. \\"machine check\\" interruptions. In time, the concept of remote support was extended to software as well (about 1973 or 1974). Through a special application, an MVS system could be connected, via RETAIN, to an IBM support center, and memory dumps and other system data could be examined remotely. The application also permitted download of software fixes, or IBM Program temporary fixes. Although the 2955 only supported a 6-bit character code (similar to the 2740 terminal), binary transfer of memory dump and software updates was accomplished through a protocol similar to the base-64 encoding scheme used today on the Internet for email attachments. Over the years, several projects have aimed to supplant RETAIN's functionality, but it has shown lasting presence despite them.

In the United States, freeform DJs are still bound by Federal Communications Commission regulations. History in the United States Many shows claim to be the first freeform radio program, but the earliest on record is \\"Nightsounds\\" on KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, D.J.'d by John Leonard. Probably the best-remembered in the Midwest is Beaker Street, which ran for almost 10 years on KAAY \\"The Mighty 1090\\" in Little Rock, Arkansas, beginning in 1966, making it also probably the best-known such show on an AM station; its signal reached from Canada to Mexico and Cuba, blanketing the Midwest and Midsouth of the U.S. WFMU is currently the longest- running freeform radio station in the United States. WNEW-FM 102.7 in NYC was the first commercial station in the US to introduce a freeform format. It stayed that way under the ownership of Metromedia Broadcasting until it was sold and the new owners were not interested. WNEW-FM was a leader in introducing new music and making household names of a good deal of the bands we know from the 1960s and '70s. Jim Ladd of KLOS in Los Angeles, California was one of the most notable freeform DJs. Tom Petty wrote a song about Jim Ladd called \\"The Last DJ\\". The only time Jim Ladd didn't have complete control over what music is being played is when he turned control over to his faithful listeners commonly referred to as \\"The Tribe\\".\\"A Brief History of Freeform Radio\\", Lowest Common Denominator, Issue #21 (c. 1998) On October 26, 2011, Ladd was among various staffers let go from KLOS following the acquisition of station owner Citadel Broadcasting by Cumulus Media. As of 2012 Ladd is hosting a daily freeform show on Sirius XM's Deep Tracks. The freeform ethos tends to disdain playlists confined to a single music genre. However, DJs may opt to play selections according to an arbitrary theme (e.g., Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" followed by Radiohead's \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\"). Freeform-ish stations that played only or almost only rock music were known as progressive rock stations, while those that play mostly folk and/or country-leaning cuts are known as Americana stations. Commercial freeform radio stations were common in the late 1960s and early '70s, particularly on the FM band, but are rare today. An exceptional case was Indie 103.1 FM of Santa Monica and Newport Beach, California. Indie 103.1 broadcast radio programs in which famous musicians from the world of popular music host radio programs and choose the playlist. Indie 103.1 recently left the FM airwaves, but currently continues on the internet. Another commercial freeform radio station is KHUM, \\"radio without the rules,\\" at 104.3 and 104.7 FM in Ferndale, California. KHUM has transmitted since 1996 and is the most popular station in Humboldt County, California. Internet radio and, to a lesser extent, college radio are sanctuaries of the freeform format (although even the latter has lost much of its independence as stations begin modeling corporate stations in their presentation). On Sirius XM satellite radio, the weekly Bob Dylan-hosted Theme Time Radio Hour featured a freeform format, as do several specialty programs on The Loft. The nationally syndicated Undercurrents, distributed by Native Voice One, follows a freeform format. Many terrestrial freeform stations are small and lack corporate backing, and therefore have relatively weak radio transmitters (especially around metropolitan areas where corporate radio signals dominate, but at the same time have enough of a population density to cover enough people to support such a station), a problem that has caused numerous broadcasters to transition to Internet radio, pirate radio or both. The full service format can be seen as a variant of the freeform format, though since most full-service stations are located in rural areas, country music, adult standards, classic hits (oldies or classic rock), and occasionally adult contemporary music tend to form the bulk of the music on a full-service station, and the vast majority of full-service stations focus primarily on mainstream, popular music (whereas freeform stations often put the emphasis on less widely known or more exotic selections). Adult hits/Jack FM The adult hits brand can be considered a \\"sequel\\" of sorts to the freeform format. Many of these stations play a wide variety of music ranging from many formats that includes, but is not limited to: Oldies/classic hits, classic rock, adult contemporary, Mainstream Top 40/Adult Top 40, etc. Most of the music played on these stations are from the years 1970-2020, although a few 1960's tracks may be sprinkled in. The most notable adult hits station brand is Jack FM, which has many affiliates across the world. Several imitators of the Jack brand and its associated slogan \\"Playing What We Want\\" have also emerged. These imitators often use the name of a person, place or a historical site and can include: Mac (E.G. Mac 94.7 Clinton, Iowa) historical figures (E.G. The Chief 92.5 Champaign, Illinois), etc. Freeform stations =United States= *KALX (Berkeley, California) *KAOS (Olympia, Washington) *KBGA (Missoula, Montana) *KBOO (Portland, Oregon) *KBUT (Crested Butte, Colorado) *KBVR (Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon) *KCOU (University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri) *KCR (San Diego State University, San Diego, California) *KCRW (Santa Monica College, Santa Monica, California) *KCSB-FM (University of California, Santa Barbara, Goleta, California) *KDHX (St. Louis, Missouri) *KDVS (University of California, Davis, Davis, California) *KDEO (Radio Free Hawaii, Waipahu, Oahu, Hawaii) *KEOL (Eastern Oregon University, La Grande, Oregon) *KFAT (defunct), (Gilroy, California) *KFFP-LP (Portland, Oregon Freeform Portland) *KFJC (Foothill College, Los Altos Hills, California) *KHUM (Ferndale, California) *KJHK (University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas) *KMMT (Mammoth Lakes, California) *KMNO (Wailuku, Hawaii) *KMNR (Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri) *KMUD (Garberville, California) *KOPN (Columbia, Missouri) *KPSU (Portland State University, Portland, Oregon) *KRBX (Boise, Idaho) *KRHV (Big Pine, California) *KRLX (Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota) *KRUI (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) *KSPC (Pomona College, Claremont, California) *KTEC (Oregon Institute of Technology, Klamath Falls, Oregon) *KTEQ-FM (South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, South Dakota) *KTRM (Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri) *K-UTE (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah) *KUCI (University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California) *KUOI (University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho) *KURE (Iowa State University.

He was described as having been the first Legionnaire to die in action, as well as the reason for the Legion's rule against members whose superhuman abilities were solely technological; however, it was later revealed that \\"James Cullen\\" was a constructed identity used by a cluster of shapeshifting amoeboid \\"Proteans\\", who were seeking to protect their race, and that, instead of being killed, Cullen had simply gone into hiding until such time as it was safe. This plotline was never fully resolved, as the Legion's universe was subsequently \\"rebooted\\" with the Zero Hour mini-series. =Reboot= James Cullen The second Kid Quantum was also named James Cullen; however, this one was an actual person rather than a constructed identity. Like his previous counterpart, he used a so-called \\"stasis belt\\" to augment his power to freeze time within a limited area to useful levels. He became a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and became its first member to die due to his overconfidence and a belt malfunction. His death also caused the \\"no technology powers\\" rule to be implemented when later characters were recruited. Jazmin Cullen The third Kid Quantum was James' sister Jazmin. After her brother's death, she underwent surgery to augment her power to a level where she would not require the belt. Despite initial hostility to the Legion when she first joined, she was eventually elected leader of the team, thanks in large part to Cosmic Boy's recommendation of her; she later entered into a relationship with him. Jazmin is a native of the planet Xanthu. =Post-Infinite Crisis= Following the Infinite Crisis, the Multiverse was reborn, now with 52 alternate Earths.

The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) ‚Äì two of whom are clones of the first one. Many critics over the years have lauded A Number, arguing Churchill created a work of significant intellectual depth with effective economy of style. Contextual information A Number is an original work published in 2002 in association with the Royal Court Theatre of London.Churchill, Caryl. A Number. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2003. The play was written during a time of public debate over the ethics of cloning. The cloning of Dolly the sheep, the creation of human embryos at Advanced Cell Technology, and the cloning of a kitten\\"What Is Warm and Fuzzy Forever? With Cloning, Kitty - New York Times.\\" The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia. 27 Feb. 2009 gave rise to controversy concerning possible human cloning. Plot synopsis Bernard 2 discovers that he is actually a clone of his \\"brother\\" (Bernard 1), who was sent to a clinical home years before by his father (Salter) after the suicide of his mother, which left him in a constant state of fear and pain. Salter explains that he agreed to a cloning experiment to try again at parenting another version of his son. But, unbeknownst to Salter, the doctors had unethically made several more clones. Salter decides that they should sue the doctors, which soothes the shaken Bernard 2. In the next scene, angry Bernard 1 visits Salter for the first time since his childhood while Bernard 2 is away. He has learned about the clones, and is furious at his father for doing it. Salter then admits that the clones were meant to give him another chance at raising Bernard, without any of his many parental mistakes. Bernard 1 grows increasingly agitated, before threatening to murder Bernard 2. Later, after Bernard 1 has left, Bernard 2 returns, having met Bernard 1 in the park. He has learned the truth about the situation, and now hates Salter for what he has done. Bernard 2 decides to leave the country for a while, both to get away from Salter and because he fears that Bernard 1 might try to kill him. Salter tries to convince him not to go, or at least to come back soon, but Bernard 2 refuses, saying he needs to go. Some time later, Bernard 1 returns and tells Salter that he followed and killed Bernard 2 after he left the country. Salter, stricken with grief, demands to know the details, but Bernard 1 refuses to say anything. Bernard 1 then leaves and kills himself, leaving Salter alone. Salter then decides to meet the other clones of his son, starting with the one named Michael Black. Michael, who never knew Salter, is a happily married maths teacher with three children. He is completely undisturbed that he is a clone, and tells Salter that he does not care. Salter demands to know more about him, particularly about something personal and unique, but Michael cannot answer. Salter then becomes unsatisfied with what Michael can give him. Characters *Salter: a man in his early sixties, he was married and had one son. His wife committed suicide by throwing herself under a train when their son was only two. He would raise their son alone, but due to his drinking and the son's issues, he would neglect him and eventually send him away. He would then clone his son (Bernard 2) in an attempt to try again to be a better father. A pathological liar, he attempts to hide the truth of what he's done from his sons. *Bernard (B2): His son, thirty-five, intended clone of his first son, made to replace his original son, Bernard 1. He is very mild-mannered and emotional. *Bernard (B1): His son, forty. First and original son of Salter. He was a difficult and disturbed child, who Salter sent away when he was 4. He would grow to have an explosive temper and hate Salter for what he did to him. *Michael Black: His son, thirty-five. An unauthorized clone of Salter‚Äôs first son. He is married with three children, the oldest aged twelve, and is a mathematics teacher. Staging Churchill gives no stage directions and no indication of a setting for the play. In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a ‚Äúbare blank design‚Äù with ‚Äúno relation to domestic realism.‚Äù De Jongh, Nicholas. \\"A Number.\\" Evening Standard [London] 27 Sept. 2002. The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design. Salter always wore a rumpled looking suit, sometimes expensive looking, but sometimes not. The various Bernards usually wore jeans and a T-shirt, but sometimes a sweatshirt.Basset, Kate. \\"A Number\\". Independent on Sunday [London] 29 Sept. 2002. Productions =Original production= The play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 23 September 2002. The production was directed by Stephen Daldry and designed by Ian MacNeil and featured the following cast: * Salter ‚Äì Michael Gambon * Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black ‚Äì Daniel Craig Lighting was designed by Rick Fisher and Ian Dickinson was the sound designer. The play won the 2002 Evening Standard Award for Best Play.Evening Standard Awards Retrieved on 8 October 2009 =Revivals= The play was revived at the Sheffield Crucible studio in October 2006 starring real-life father and son Timothy West and Samuel West. This production later played at the Chocolate Factory in 2010 and at the Fugard Theatre, Cape Town in 2011. The play was revived at The Nuffield Theatre (Southampton) in February 2014 with John and Lex Shrapnel to huge critical acclaim.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/14/a-number-caryl- churchill-theatre-review-lyn-gardner It transferred to the Young Vic Theatre in June 2015.

Reception Ben Brantley of The New York Times described A Number as \\"stunning\\" and \\"a gripping dramatic consideration of what happens to autonomous identity in a world where people can be cloned\\". James M. Brandon had mixed sentiments in Theatre Journal, arguing that while it \\"is a wellwritten play‚Äîevocative, disturbing, and with more than one surprise‚Äîit remains a troubled one that seems, in production, unfinished. \\" The critic disputed comparisons of the broken dialogue to that of David Mamet and said that \\"the language here is not nearly as compelling on the stage\\". However, Brandon praised the final scene as \\"brilliant\\" and said that one of its characters \\"serves as a welcome reminder that it is possible to have an ostensibly normal life\\", ultimately describing A Number as \\"one of the more intellectually vital scripts to emerge in the new century\\" despite shortcomings. In a 2006 review of a later Churchill work, The Independent's Paul Taylor described the play as one of the best dramas of the new millennium, and as \\"superbly compressed and economic\\". After watching a performance featuring John and Lex Shrapnel, Lyn Gardner of The Guardian dubbed the play \\"[p]unchy, compact and endlessly inquisitive,\\" arguing that it \\"is no simple warning against the perils of science messing with nature, but a complex and humane study of parental guilt, regret and responsibility and what it really means to be a father or son.\\" Conversely, Jane Shillings of The Telegraph argued, \\"The highly wrought writing veers at times towards the mannered, leaving a faint sense that the style of Churchill‚Äôs play exceeds its substance, and the issue of cloning has lost its urgency\\". Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe praised the way the playwright \\"devotes no time to preamble or writerly throat-clearing, but plunges us straightaway into the play‚Äôs central dilemma\\". In the Chicago Tribune, Chris Jones described A Number as \\"masterfully written\\". After seeing a 2020 Bridge Theatre performance, Nick Curtis of Evening Standard argued, \\"If the background logistics are sketchy ‚Äì who made the human copies, and why? ‚Äì the relationships between Salter and his offspring, and their differing reactions to finding that they are not unique, are right on the money. [...] It‚Äôs almost exactly an hour long and the ending is abrupt, but Churchill packs more ideas and feeling into that time than most dramatists manage at twice the length.\\" Clive Davis of The Times, however, panned the play as \\"both too short and too long\\" after seeing the same performance. Matt Wolf lauded A Number as a \\"beautiful play\\", and wrote that it \\"works not least as a thriller or bit of forensic detection, as Churchill plants clues prompting a reevaluation of the narrative at every turn.\\" Arjun Neil Alim of The Independent stated that \\"Churchill, a political playwright par excellence, tactfully references current events. [...] Are 'Who are you?' and 'What are you made from?' the same question? Churchill‚Äôs answer comes in the form of a character who defines himself by his deeds and his loved ones, rather than the circumstances of his birth.\\" Andrzej Lukowski of Time Out called the play a \\"masterpiece\\". Steve Dinneen argued in City A.M. that the work \\"is remarkable in the way it so gracefully touches upon the great philosophical questions without ever feeling didactic. A Number is no cold thought experiment, but a quiet rumination on human nature\\". Dineen wrote that Salter's interludes \\"say as much as an hour‚Äôs worth of dialogue\\". Arifa Akbar of The Guardian said that \\"Churchill‚Äôs linguistic tics ‚Äì of interruptions and half-finished sentences ‚Äì create a hyperreal effect and enable Salter‚Äôs obfuscation\\". Richard Pahl of Northwest Herald billed A Number as an \\"engaging meditation on human cloning, personal identity and the conflicting claims of nature and nurture\\". Pahl wrote that the work \\"offers intellectual and emotional depth, and illustrates the ways people rationalize bad behavior and unthinkingly objectify others, including their own flesh and blood. It asks important questions.\\" Interpretation Dinneen argued that the play is about \\"our desire to be unique, for our lives to have meaning, for our imperfect minds and bodies to somehow achieve perfect ends.\\" Pahl wrote that questions asked by the play are, \\"If we had a do-over, could we atone for our mistakes? What is the value of a human life? What is the source of our individuality?\\" Adaptations A Number was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films. Starring Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 10 Sep 2008.

The freeway acts as an important trade corridor from Interstate 81 between New York and Eastern Ontario via Highway 401, as well as the fastest link between Ottawa and Toronto. Highway 416 passes through a largely rural area, except near its northern terminus where it enters the suburbs of Ottawa. The freeway also serves several communities along its length, notably Spencerville and Kemptville. Highway 416 had two distinct construction phases. Highway 416 \\"North\\" was the segment starting from an interchange at Highway 417 and bypassing the original route of Highway 16 into Ottawa (now Prince of Wales Drive) along a new right-of-way. Highway 416 \\"South\\" was the twinning of of Highway 16 New‚Äîa two-lane expressway constructed throughout the 1970s and finished in 1983 that bypassed the original highway‚Äîand the construction of a new interchange with Highway 401\\\\. Sections of both opened throughout the late 1990s. Highway 416 was commemorated as the Veterans Memorial Highway on the 54th anniversary of D-Day in 1998. The final link was officially opened by a World War I veteran and local officials on September 23, 1999.  Route description  Highway 416 entering the western end of Ottawa. The Fallowfield Road interchange is shown. Highway 416 begins at an interchange with Highway 401, branching to the north near the community of Johnstown in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. This interchange only provides access to and from the west of Highway 401, but immediately north of it, a second interchange with the remaining section of Highway 16 provides access from Johnstown and to a parclo interchange with both directions of Highway 401, as well as to the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge crossing to Ogdensburg, New York. Proceeding north, the two carriageways of the freeway are separated by a forested median. The route is surrounded by thick forests for the next . As it passes beneath Leeds and Grenville County Road 44, the original routing of Highway 16 (the Prescott Highway) south of Spencerville, it exits the forest and enters farm fields. The route travels to the east of the community, access to which is provided by an interchange at County Road 21, and crosses a swamp and the South Nation River. Highway 416 crosses under the Prescott Highway a second time; to the north, the two remain roughly parallel but separated as they pass through a mix of farmland and forest. South of the community of Kemptville, the Prescott Highway crosses the route a third time, with an interchange connecting the two highways. The freeway curves to the northeast, bypassing Kemptville and featuring an interchange with County Road 43 (formerly Highway 43). It crosses the line of the old Bytown and Prescott Railway, then curves to the northwest, providing an interchange with River Road. At the southeast corner of the River Road interchange is the Veterans Commemorative Park, dedicated in 2000 by the Royal Canadian Legion.The tiny Veterans Commemorative Park (45.08174,-75.63193) at the highway's approximate midpoint may be reached on foot directly from a commuter parking lot on the southeast corner of River Road's Highway 416 interchange. It crosses the Rideau River and enters the City of Ottawa. Aside from the first couple of kilometres north of the Rideau River, the majority of the freeway cuts through swaths of farmland which fill the Ottawa Valley. The median also becomes narrower. The freeway encounters an interchange with Dilworth Road and thereafter with Roger Stevens Drive, the latter providing access to North Gower. Continuing north of Manotick through fields, Highway 416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway for the fourth and final time as that road turns northeast and travels into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Shortly thereafter is an interchange with Brophy Drive / Bankfield Road; the latter provides access to the Prescott Highway / Prince of Wales Drive. Approaching urban Ottawa, the route passes alongside a large quarry, then jogs to the west along an S-curve, crossing the Jock River in the process. After this, an interchange with Fallowfield Road provides access to the suburb of Barrhaven which occupies portions of the land immediately east of the freeway. The route jogs back to the east along a second S-curve and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside the Stony Swamp. The final section of Highway 416 travels parallel to Cedarview Road, which was relocated for the freeway. The Stony Swamp lies west of the route while farmland lies to the east. At the northern end of the swamp is an interchange with West Hunt Club Road. The freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending gently into a trench. It passes beneath Bruin Road and the Ottawa Central Railway while traveling alongside Lynwood Village in Bells Corners. The highway is crossed by Baseline Road and Richmond Road; the former provides an onramp to southbound Highway 416\\\\. The freeway ends at a large interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 417 (Exit 131), just south of the Lakeview and Bayshore communities on the Ottawa River; downtown Ottawa is to the east and Kanata is to the west. = Design features = The Stony Swamp overpass at the southern entrance to Ottawa is a pre- tensioned concrete arch; the design, which allows the structure to cross the entire right of way with a single span, won the 1996 Award of Excellence from the Portland Cement Association. The bridge acts as a gateway to the National Capital Region and is the longest rigid frame bridge in Ontario with a span. In the same vicinity, the freeway sinks below ground level in a trench; groundwater-retaining walls were installed to prevent the lowering of the water table in adjacent wetlands, therefore mitigating damage to them. At the Jock River, southwest of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented a challenge in designing the crossing for the freeway as well as the Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted. Sloped rock cuts line the side of the freeway in numerous locations. With the intent of reducing the severity of collisions against those cuts, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) tested out numerous alternatives to strike a cost-to-benefit balance. The standard slope used by the MTO is vertical, offset from the edge of the pavement by . The study concluded that although an initially higher investment would be required, the 2:1 sloped cut with grass overlaid produced the best results.  History  Highway 416 is commemorated as the Veterans Memorial Highway. Signs placed along the length of the highway in English and French (in background) indicate this along with the phrase Lest we forget. = Highway 16 New = In 1966, the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to today's MTO, published the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study, identifying the need for a controlled-access highway between Ottawa and Highway 401. Highway 16, which passes over the geologically subdued St. Lawrence Lowlands, was selected over Highway 15, which crosses the undulating Canadian Shield to the west, as the ideal route for the new link. Highway 16 was one of the first roads taken over by the expanding Department of Public Highways in 1918. The important corridor between the Trans-provincial Highway (Highway 2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the road was given a numerical designation to supplement the name. This highway served the low traffic volumes of the day, but as the number of vehicles increased over the first half of the 20th century, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. To overcome this issue of abutting properties long- established on the old Highway 16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway 401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway 16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated. Construction of the super two, dubbed Highway 16 New, took place between 1969 and 1983. The Spencerville Bypass opened by 1971, connecting with the old highway in the south near Crowder Road and in the north near Ventnor Road. By the end of 1973, the new highway was completed from immediately north of Highway 401 through Leeds and Grenville United Counties and into Ottawa‚ÄìCarleton. This included a bypass around Kemptville and a new structure over the Rideau River. The new highway ended at Dilworth Road (Regional Road 13). For nearly a decade, no new construction took place. Then, during the summer of 1982, the MTO awarded a contract to construct the route north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower and extending the route as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional Road 6), including a structure over Stevens Creek. Following completion of this first contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road 8). The project was completed in 1983, merging into the original route of Highway 16 northeast of the present Prince of Wales Drive overpass. Highway 416 approaching its terminus at Highway 417 in Ottawa With the completion of Highway 16 New, the MTO needed only to construct interchanges and the southbound lanes in order to create a full freeway corridor. The upgrade to Highway 416 took place between 1989 and 1999 and was carried out through two separate projects: Highway 416 North was a freeway on a new alignment through Ottawa and an interchange at Highway 417, and Highway 416 South was the twinning of of Highway 16 New and an interchange at Highway 401. = Change of plans = The original plans for Highway 416, conceived during the late 1960s, had it enter Ottawa along the Merivale Corridor to merge with the Queensway approximately east of the present interchange. However, when it came time to construct this section, public attitudes had shifted and environmental concerns had come to the forefront of everyday life; new roads were now subject to intense public scrutiny. Suburbs grew along Merivale Road, prompting the Region of Ottawa‚ÄìCarleton to request the MTO decommission the right-of-way along the road in 1977, which it did. The passing of the Environmental Assessment Act in 1975, however, meant that new projects were subject to a lengthy investigation of social and environmental concerns. In 1981, the MTO began an environmental assessment into a new alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway 16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along the new route. This contract was completed in 1993, after which budgetary restraints prevented the awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway 417 and some overpasses, construction activity on Highway 416 came to a standstill for two years. It was during this period that the MTO undertook an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway 407 became a tolled highway and for a time it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway 416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located along the length of the freeway. = Twinning and completion = Work resumed on Highway 416 North following the review. It was opened from Century Road to Hunt Club Road on July 16, 1996, and completed on July 31, 1997, with the opening of the interchange with Highway 417. The cost of this section was C$196 million. On December 8, 1995, in North Gower, the provincial and federal governments announced a financing deal to ensure Highway 416 South was completed by 2000. This section of the route was constructed through a process known as twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges. With the right-of-way along Highway 16 New already purchased, construction was able to proceed without disruption to local properties or traffic. The project was constructed through five contracts. The first was awarded to Tarmac Canada on June 10, 1996, calling for twinning of from Century Road south to Roger Stevens Drive. Another contract was awarded one month later to Bot Construction, on August 19\\\\. This contract involved the section from Roger Stevens Drive south to what was then Highway 43, a distance of . On June 12, 1997, the first section opened, connecting with the Ottawa Bypass at Century Road. On July 10, the third contract was awarded to Armbro Construction to construct the section from Highway 43 south to Grenville County Road 20 (Oxford Station Road). Another contract followed on October 21 for the south to Grenville County Road 20 (Shanly Road) which was awarded to Bot Construction. The fifth and final contract was awarded to Armbro Construction on April 8, 1998, calling for the construction of the southern and the two flyover ramps at Highway 401. The section between Roger Stevens Drive and what had now become Leeds and Grenville County Road 43, including a second crossing of the Rideau River, opened to traffic on June 26, 1998. This was followed two months later by the section between Highway 43 and Oxford Station Road, which opened on August 24. On the fifty-fourth anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1998, then Transportation Minister Tony Clement unveiled two signs in Ottawa and formally declared the entire length of Highway 416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, despite earlier reluctance from previous minister Al Palladini. Six additional signs were also installed along the length of the route. At the time, the Veterans Memorial Parkway in London already existed. Since then, two additional veterans highways have been named: on October 20, 2002, the Veterans Highway was designated in Halton Region along Regional Road 25; on September 23, 2010, the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway was designated in Niagara Falls along Regional Road 420. A ceremony was held in Johnstown on September 23, 1999 to open the final section of Highway 416 that would complete the link from Highway 401 to Highway 417\\\\. Premier Mike Harris, Transportation Minister David Turnbull and World War I Veteran James W. Fraser officially opened the highway. On December 14, 2009, there was a 60‚Äì70 vehicle pileup due to fog and icy conditions, forcing the closure of the highway in both directions.

He came in second place in the November 2010 election for Mayor of Oakland. Perata worked with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to gain passage of five infrastructure related bond measures in 2006. Prior to serving in the State Senate, Perata served in the California State Assembly, as a member of the Board of Supervisors of Alameda County, and as a high school teacher. Background Born in Alameda, California, Perata is the son of Italian immigrants. During his childhood, he helped his father, Dick, to deliver milk door-to-door for the Lakehurst Creamery in Alameda.Perata4Mayor.Com Perata graduated from Saint Joseph High School and earned his degree from Saint Mary's College of California. He taught English, History, and Civics from 1966 to 1981 in Alameda County schools. Perata has a daughter and a son. Alameda County politics Perata began his political career when he ran for Mayor of Alameda in 1975 but was narrowly defeated. In 1986 he was elected to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and was re- elected to a second term. As Supervisor, Perata worked to shut down problematic liquor stores, ban cigarette advertising, and lobbied the state legislature for an assault weapons ban and funding for the mentally ill. Rise to the California State Senate Having served eight years representing Oakland as an Alameda County Supervisor, Perata's first attempt at state politics came in the 1994 democratic primary for controller, aged 49. He was unsuccessful, capturing 27.27% of the vote. Afterwards, Perata served as a staff assistant for then Senate Pro Tem Bill Lockyer. In 1996, Perata was elected as a California State Assemblyman for the Oakland, Alameda, and Piedmont district.perata4mayor.com In 1998, Perata ran for the State Senate for the 9th District which currently includes Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Dublin, El Sobrante, Emeryville, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, Richmond, and San Pablo. Perata's run (and election) to the State Senate in 1998 was part of a series of five special elections that were held in the East Bay within less than 12 months, as Perata and other East Bay politicians vied for different political offices. For a detailed account of events, see Special election musical chairs. Don Perata was selected by his peers in the California Democratic Party to lead the party in the California State Senate in 2004, becoming the California State Senate President Pro Tempore and leader of Senate. The position is the highest-ranking leader and most powerful member of the Senate.President pro tempore of the California State Senate The state Democratic Party re-elected Perata as President pro Tem until his retirement from the State Senate in 2008.Perata4Mayor.com California State Senate Portrait of Perata during his time as a state senator Perata is a staunch advocate of gun control. In 1999, Perata successfully drove legislation that updated the California \\"assault weapons\\" ban by adding a ban of generically described semi-automatic firearms. He obtained a concealed weapons permit to legally carry a loaded handgun in public. He claimed this was necessary for self-defense due to threats on his life and the well-being of his family from some individual opponents of his pro-gun control legislative activity.Perata letter requesting handgun permit, Ninehundred.net; accessed August 5, 2017. Perata has been an advocate for the rights of the elderly, the mentally ill, and the disabled. He supported legislation to create a discount drug program and legislation to require HMOs to pay for mental health treatment. He supported legislation that secured $27 million annually for ovarian and prostate cancer and legislation that increase access to breast cancer screening for low-income women. He has authored legislation requiring California utilities companies to contract for cleaner energy sources and supported tougher penalties on oil refinery emissions. In early 2005, Perata introduced a bill to repair California's flagging infrastructure including highway improvements, housing reform and levee repairs. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger began to speak out in favor of improving state infrastructure after Schawarzenegger's November 2005 special election ballot initiatives were defeated. While Schwarzenegger's plan included fixing transportation problems, his infrastructure plan was drastically more costly and advocated more prisons and did not address the housing problem. In a rare occurrence for Sacramento politicians, in early 2006 Perata and Schwarzenegger began to work together to piece together a bipartisan infrastructure plan that both sides of the legislature could embrace. They were successful and five bond measures were approved by California voters on the November 2006 ballot. These measures are aimed at improving roads, mass transit, affordable housing, levee repair, and upgrading educational facilities. In July 2007, during state budget negotiations, Perata ordered the Senate to remain in session for 19 hours in an attempt to reach an agreement on the budget. California requires two-thirds of both legislative houses and the governor's signature to pass a budget. Perata needed two Republican votes in the State Senate to pass the budget and the lock down aimed to get those two Republican votes. The California State Senate Republicans presented a revised budget that aimed to reduce state spending and included tax credits to some Fortune 500 corporations, cuts to transportation and welfare, and eliminating cost-of-living pay raises to the blind, elderly, and disabled.GOP budget plan would slash welfare: Proposal to go before the full Senate would cut $1 billion more than the Assembly version and removee aid from thousands of families by Halper, Evan & Jordan Rau.

Perata and the Senate Democrats rejected the Senate Republican budget proposal and the Republicans held out for weeks into August, preventing many state legislators from returning home for their summer recess, before the budget was passed. Perata retaliated against Republican Jeff Denham for voting against the budget by stripping Denham of committee assignments and contributing to a recall effort against Denham.Perata retaliates against Republican who helped hold up budget, sfgate.com; accessed August 5, 2017. Perata's concluded about the Capitol: \\"There is no center. I'm not talking about political center. There is no action center, or moral center, or anything else left in Sacramento.\\"Evan Halper and Michael Rothfeld, \\"Is California too unwieldy to govern?\\", Los Angeles Times, December 15, 2008 In an April interview, Perata reflected on the value of the legislation passed by the State Legislature under his leadership as President pro tempore of the California State Senate: \\"Almost everything I wanted to do in Sacramento that was beneficial to the state‚Äîwhether it was on gun control or infant mortality‚Äîwas twice as beneficial to my district. In many instances, my role was to get it done; I didn't have the need to take or get the credit, just results.\\"Perata says he'd guide Oakland with a firm hand Post-Senate Proposition 93, a term limit alteration ballot measure sponsored by Perata and Assembly Speaker Fabian N√∫√±ez, did not pass in February 2008. Perata termed out of the State Senate (and N√∫√±ez termed out of the State Assembly) in 2008. The proposition would have allowed Perata to serve one more term in the State Senate (and N√∫√±ez three more terms in the State Assembly). Perata was a target for criticism by the opposition to Proposition 93. One television ad included the following line: \\"Don Perata, whose home was raided by the FBI in the ongoing corruption probe.\\"Fact Check: Ballot Proposition 93, Knbc.com, January 24, 2008. Perata filed a \\"statement of intention\\" to run for the California Board of Equalization in 2010,Laundering Money With Don Perata but instead decided to run for Mayor of Oakland after incumbent Ron Dellums declined to run for re- election.Perata is Oakland's Hope, Clintreilly.com; accessed August 5, 2017. In the November 2010 election, Perata ran for Mayor in a field of nine candidates. The two other major contenders were City Council members Jean Quan and Rebecca Kaplan. He led in first-place balloting, but came in second place following winner Quan after taking into account ranked choice balloting (instant runoff). Perata was also the co-chair of a California campaign committee to pass the California Cancer Research Act, 2012's Proposition 29 a ballot measure that was defeated by California voters on June 5, 2012. If it would have passed, the measure was projected to generate over $500 million annually for cancer research by levying a new $1-per-pack tax on tobacco products in California. Revenues would have also been spent on smoking- cessation programs, and tobacco law-enforcement. Political controversy In early 2004, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Perata's friend and associate, Timothy G. Staples, had received $313,000 in business from political campaigns initiated or supported by Perata. At the same time, Staples had paid Perata $100,000 per year in consulting fees that supplement Perata's Senate salary, according to financial records and interviews with the senator. After this disclosure The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights sent a letter to the Senate stating that Perata's payments for consulting work looked \\"like a complex and illegal money-laundering mechanism.\\" That same week the Senate Ethics Committee began an investigation into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate's standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the Chronicle reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. The Senate Ethics Committee again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship. Additional stories by The Chronicle during this time insinuated that Perata had carried a bill on behalf of Mercury Insurance, which may have allowed the company to circumvent Prop. 103. Mercury, in turn, donated $50,000 to a political committee run by Oakland developer Phil Tagami, who later hired Staples, who had previously paid Perata as a consultant.Perata Probe Heats Up? In early November 2004, Perata became the official target of a probe by the Justice Department under Republican President, George W. Bush. The FBI, the US Attorney's Office, and a federal grand jury investigated whether Perata took bribes or kickbacks from friends and campaign donors in exchange for his help.'Road to Nowhere: The FBI probes links between state Senator Don Perata and a $40 million roadway project designed to enrich Alameda developer Ron Cowan East Bay Express, March 1, 2006.

In May 2007, the East Bay Express, an alternative weekly in the Bay Area, published a two- part investigation of Perata. The articles suggested that between 1998 and 2007, Perata spent more than $1 million of campaign cash on parties and high- end lifestyle expenditures, amounting to more than one-quarter of the total he raised for his reelection campaigns in that time. The same free publication also alleged that Perata had manipulated liberal causes, such as antiwar sentiment, for his own political ends. and had used campaign donations to support his lavish lifestyle. The FBI investigation lasted five years. No arrests or indictments occurred, and in early 2009, Justice Department officials closed the case and announced they would not be filing any charges.

Biography Born Haim Brotzlewsky in Vienna, Austria in 1924, Bar-Lev made aliyah to Mandate Palestine in 1939. From 1942 through 1948, Bar-Lev served in various Jewish military units, such as the Palmach. He became both a pilot and a parachutist, which would later serve him in developing both of these military branches in the young Israel Defense Forces. In 1946 Bar-Lev blew up the Allenby Bridge near Jericho to prevent Arab militiamen in Trans-Jordan from entering Jewish towns west of the Jordan River. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Bar-Lev was the commander of the Eighth Battalion (Mechanized) in the Negev Brigade, which fought in the southern part of the country and the Sinai. During the 1956 Suez Crisis he commanded the 27th Armored Brigade, which captured the Gaza Strip before turning southwest and reaching the Suez Canal. By 1964 he became of Director of Operations within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During the June 1967 Six-Day War he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff in the IDF. In late 1968 he accepted Maj. Gen. Adan's proposal that a high sand-dune wall be built along the east bank of the Suez Canal to prevent the Egyptian military from observing Israeli defenses along the Suez Canal. Behind the sand dune a line of fixed fortifications was constructed. This became known as the Bar Lev Line. Between 1968 and 1971, Bar-Lev served as IDF's Chief of General Staff, which made him the highest-ranking military officer. During the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, although retired from the IDF and serving as the Minister of Trade and Industry, he was recalled by Prime Minister Golda Meir back into military service to replace Shmuel \\"Gorodish\\" Gonen as chief of the Southern Command, which defended the Sinai Peninsula. Bar-Lev played a pivotal role in the war. Before his appointment the Southern front was in disarray to the point of near total collapse and Gonen was proving unable to effectively control the situation. Bar-Lev immediately took charge and worked towards stabilizing the front. His political and negotiating skills also proved instrumental in controlling his field generals who were feuding amongst themselves since each had their own notions, sometimes competing ones, regarding how the war in the South should be carried out. The effect that Bar- Lev's arrival had on the chaotic Southern command headquarters was described by Gonen's deputy, Uri Ben-Ari, in testimony to the Israeli military's historical department: > Bar-Lev brought calmness on all of us. Finally there was a feeling that we > had a real commander in charge. This feeling spread between us and later > also in the battlefield radios like fire. Bar-Lev also managed to calm > Gorodish down. Prior to his arrival, general staff meetings were one loud > shout out of Gorodish's mouth.

No one [who did > not belong there] was allowed entry. Serenity descended on the war room. The > general staff officers switched to carrying out their tasks in well > organized shifts. Even Arik [Ariel Sharon]'s tone of voice changed when Bar > Lev arrived. =Political career= Bar-Lev remained Minister of Trade and Industry until the Alignment government was defeated and replaced by the Likud under the leadership of Menachem Begin following the 1977 elections, in which Bar-Lev was elected to the Knesset for the first time. Between 1977 and 1984 he served as General Secretary of the Labor Party, the largest faction in the Alignment. When the Alignment joined the national unity governments that held office between 1984 and 1990, Bar-Lev served as Minister of Police and as a member of the \\"inner cabinet\\". He retired from the Knesset at the time of the 1992 elections, and was appointed ambassador to Russia, serving until 1994. He died in Tel Aviv on 7 May 1994. His son Omer Bar-Lev is an Israeli politician member of the Labor Party.

She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 2003, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris. Background Marland worked as a bank accountant and dental assistant in private life. She began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Peel Board of Education from 1974 to 1978. From 1978 to 1985, she served as Mississauga City Councillor for Ward 2. She was also a member of the board of governors for the Oakville-Trafalgar Hospital, and served as governor of Sheridan College. Politics Marland was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating her Liberal opponent by about 1,500 votes in the traditionally Conservative riding of Mississauga South. The Tories won a minority government in this election, but were defeated in the house shortly thereafter; Marland held a number of critic's positions in opposition. Marland supported Larry Grossman for the party leadership in late 1985 (Toronto Star, 6 November 1985). In the provincial election of 1987, she defeated Liberal candidate Claudette MacKay- Lassonde by only 599 votes to retain her seat. The Tories were reduced to only 17 seats out of 130 in this election. In early 1990, Marland was named deputy house leader of her party. Marland was re-elected by a significant majority in the election of 1990, in which the Tories increased their standing to 20 seats. She again held a number of critic's roles in opposition. The Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Marland was re- elected by a landslide in Mississauga South. She was not immediately appointed to cabinet by Mike Harris, and was defeated by Al McLean in her bid to become Speaker of the legislature. She was subsequently named chair of the Progressive Conservative caucus in recognition of her parliamentary experience. When McLean was forced to resign in disgrace in 1996, Marland was Harris's choice to be his replacement; the legislature, however, elected Chris Stockwell to the position. On October 10, 1997, Marland was named a Minister without Portfolio in Harris's government with responsibility for Children. She was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, and was dropped from cabinet on February 7, 2001. Although known as a strong regional representative, Marland was not a major player in the Harris government, and was not brought back into cabinet by Ernie Eves when he replaced Harris as leader in 2002. Marland was favoured to be re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, but lost to Liberal Tim Peterson by only 234 votes in a Liberal sweep of the Mississauga area. After politics Since her defeat, she has kept largely a low profile, but made a statement critical of Tim Peterson's automatic installation as PC candidate after he crossed the floor, saying that it was \\"despicable the way this has been dealt with.\\" References External links * Category:1934 births Category:Women government ministers of Canada Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Politicians from St. Catharines Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:Women MPPs in Ontario Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:21st-century Canadian women politicians Category:Ontario school board trustees Category:Mississauga city councillors Category:Women municipal councillors in Canada ","title":"Margaret Marland"},{"id":"1258161","text":"102.9 Triple M Newcastle (call sign: 2KKO) is an Australian radio station, licensed to, and serving Newcastle and surrounds. It broadcasts at 102.9 megahertz on the FM band from its studios in Newcastle. It is owned by Southern Cross Austereo and Its sister station is hit106.9. History The station commenced operations on 1 August 1931 as 2KO, based in the Newcastle suburb of KOtara, hence the call-sign. Founded by Allen Fairhall (later Sir Allen Fairhall) 2KO was licensed to The Newcastle Broadcasting Company. The station operated on 1415 kHz with a transmission strength of 25 watts. The station launched from the backyard of a resident's home, with the licensee's dining room being the only studio the station had at the time. Programs ran from 7 to 10 p.m., later moving into daytime programming. Ten minutes of ad time was sold during the week, selling around 15 pounds ($30 today) of revenue for the station. Chief Engineer was K. N. Greenhalgh AMIRE. Studio & Production Manager was 2KO Chief Announcer Harold Pickhover. Advertising & Merchandising Manager was Keith F. Winser F.O.A. Two years later in 1933, the station moved its AM transmitter to Sandgate, and was operated from several locations including 72 Hunter Street, Newcastle until January 1937, when new studios and offices in the heart of Newcastle in the CML Building at 110 Hunter Street. In its time on the AM band, the station had its power increased twice, first to 2,000 watts, and then to 5,000 watts, using a directional aerial system. In the days before television, peak listening time was around 8pm, but with television arriving in the country in the late 1950s, the station had to change formats to survive the new medium. This was even more the case when 2KO's owners at the time, United Broadcasting Company (Australia) (who also owned Sydney's 2UE), itself owned by the local Lamb family, was part of the consortium that brought television to Newcastle, launching NBN Television on channel 3 in 1962. These changes led to 2KO becoming a Top 40 music radio station. This took the audience by storm, and helped re-established radio as the personal medium. Until 1978 there was a 10 kHz gap between radio stations. However, the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 changed this to a 9 kHz gap, thus allowing more stations on the AM band. Therefore, on 23 November 1978, most Australian stations changed their frequencies and 2K0 went from 1430 kHz to 1413 kHz. In May 1988, 2KO moved to facilities at 252 Pacific Highway Charlestown. KOFM / NXFM use MAESTRO for music play out & Automation after network programs until live assist. On 12 October 1992, 2KO converted to the FM band, changing its callsign to 2KKO, and branding itself as KOFM 102.9. Four years later, on 22 January 1996, the parent company of KOFM (and of NXFM), Radio Newcastle Pty. Ltd., was purchased by Austereo. A few more years later, Austereo sold 50% to RG Capital Radio Network, whose stake in the station then transferred in 2004 to Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, upon the purchase of RG Capital's stations. On April 2011 Southern Cross Media bought out Austereo for $714 million giving Southern Cross Media full ownership of KOFM. In late June 2017, the station again moved but this time to state of the art facilities in 18 Honeysuckle Drive. On 9 November 2018, KOFM was renamed to 102.9 Triple M Newcastle.

Early life Born in Trujillo, Mantilla is the younger of two daughters of Olmedo Lucio Mantilla Mayer and Elvia Elizabeth Garc√≠a Linares. She was studying to become a high school teacher and planned to start a second degree in Tourism. One of her dreams was to own an online tourism company to promote her native town and country all over the world. Her city, Trujillo, is a mixture of colonial and pre-Columbian architecture. In 2001, Mantilla became the Peruvian national champion of Triathlon and Pentathlon, and was elected national athlete of the year. She is a professional dancer in The Marinera, a typical local dance. With a group of ladies, she developed a program in Trujillo to give breakfast to hundreds of children in poor areas. Miss Peru In 2004, she was Miss La Libertad and won the right to represent Peru in the Miss World contest as runner-up to Liesel Holler (Miss Peru Universe 2004) and was one of the major favorites in the run-up to the pageant, which was decided by a global television/telephone/online vote. Popularly known in her country as \\"Maju\\" Mantilla, her aunt Mar√≠a Julia Mantilla Mayer was Miss Peru 1969. Miss World 2004 On December 4, 2004, in the Beauty Crown Theatre located in the Chinese beach city of Sanya, she was crowned Miss World 2004 by the winner from the year before, Rosanna Davison of Ireland, becoming the second winner from Peru since Madeline Hartog-Bel in 1967. She was also crowned Miss World Americas. Mantilla was a record breaker for Peru during the competition, and was among the semifinalists in three fast track events. In Miss World Sports, she tied for third place with Kenisha Thom of Trinidad & Tobago. In Miss World Talent, she was among the Top 25 semifinalists with a traditional Peruvian dance, The Marinera Norte√±a. And finally, in Contestants' Choice, she placed second runner-up.

Triple M is a sister station sharing the same building. History hit106.9's history can be traced back to Singleton radio station 2SI,http://www.austamradiohistory.com owned by Alex Mather (VK2JZ) and the Singleton Argus newspaper which never went to air. The licence was obtained by Hunter River Broadcasters Pty. Ltd. and changed to 2HR. The station launched on 30 August 1937. Shareholders included the Singleton Argus and the Robinson Family. Three years later, the station was moved to Maitland, with transmitter at Lochinvar. In those days, 2HR operated on 680 kHz with 300 watts of power, and was affiliated with the Macquarie Broadcasting Network. Programs were originated locally between 6:30 am and 6:30 pm, before taking the Macquarie feed at 6:30 pm. In the 1950s, 2HR was relocated to Newcastle, with its transmitter located in Bolwarra. Station manager Ken Robinson was a former Army officer, and his identification number had the letters NX. Therefore, the station was given the callsign 2NX, and a new frequency at 1360 kHz . In 1971, 2NX's owners Hunter Broadcasters were purchased by the Catholic Broadcasting Company, owned by the Catholic Church. 2NX programming still was relayed to 2NM overnight during this time, and was identified as 2NXNM. In the early 1990s, the Catholic Church got out of broadcasting, and sold 2NX to Radio Newcastle, which was later taken over by Austereo, and then sold a 50% stake to RG Capital Radio Network (which was taken over by Macquarie Bank). 2NX was granted a license to convert to FM in the '90s and moved to 106.9 MHz, branding itself originally as X107, before changing to NXFM. On April 2011 Southern Cross Media bought out Austereo for more than 700 million giving Southern Cross Media full ownership of NX FM. On 15 December 2016 NXFM became known as hit106.9 in Southern Cross Austereo's mass re-branding of its regional radio network. Hit 106.9 are a sponsor of local A-League team the Newcastle Jets.

According to the 2001 census it had a population of 5,533, increasing to 6,011 at the 2011 census. The village is served by Stansted Mountfitchet railway station. Stansted Mountfitchet is situated in north west Essex near the Hertfordshire border and 3 miles (5 km) north of Bishop's Stortford. Stansted Airport is from the village. The village has three primary schools (Bentfield Primary School, St Mary's (C of E) Primary School and Magna Carta Primary Academy), and one high school which was renamed the Forest Hall School in September, 2013. History Stansted was a Saxon settlement (the name means 'stony place' in Anglo-Saxon) that predates the Norman conquest. In the 1086 Domesday Book, Stansted was in the ancient hundred of Uttlesford.Open Domesday Online: Stansted (Mountfichet), accessed November 2017. It was one of many villages and manors controlled by the powerful Robert Gernon de Montfichet (from Montfiquet in Calvados, Normandy), so began to be referred to as Stansted Mountfitchet to differentiate it from similarly named places. A small remnant of his castle remains, around which a reconstruction of an early Norman castle has been built. Believed to have been fortified originally in the Iron Age, and subsequently by the Romans and Vikings, construction of the Norman castle began in 1066. Lord Mountfitchet is also considered the 11th century builder of Montfichet's Tower in London. St Mary the Virgin's Church, built in the 1120s, is a redundant church under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The brick west tower was added in 1692. A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist was built in 1889 nearer the centre of the village and is now the village church. Stansted Hall was built in 1871. Landmarks Stansted Mountfitchet Windmill Other village attractions include the House on the Hill Toy Museum, which its owners claim \\"is the largest toy museum in the World\\". Located next to Mountfitchet Castle and Norman Village of 1066, both attractions are owned by Alan Goldsmith. The museum opened in 1991 and holds over 80,000 toys, mostly from the 1950s to the 1990s. A working windmill built in 1787 is in the village, and is open to the public once a month. During the Second World War, the US Air Force constructed an airfield near the village. After the war ended, it was subsequently taken over by the government and developed as a commercial airport. Today, London Stansted Airport is accessible by road from Junction 8 of the M11 motorway, near Bishop's Stortford and direct by train from London Liverpool Street. Economy In March 2013, Stansted Mountfitchet was named as the UK's fourth most internet- friendly town. The Google eTown Awards recognise the top places where businesses are most actively embracing the web, and Stansted's high ranking reflects the increased use of the internet to spur economic growth. The results put Stansted in fourth place behind Richmond, in third, Edinburgh, in second, and Stratford upon Avon, which took the top spot.Stansted crowned as leading UK e-commerce town, hertsandessexobserver.co.uk; accessed 11 November 2015.

In healthy neural tissue, astrocytes play critical roles in energy provision, regulation of blood flow, homeostasis of extracellular fluid, homeostasis of ions and transmitters, regulation of synapse function and synaptic remodeling. Astrogliosis changes the molecular expression and morphology of astrocytes, causing scar formation and, in severe cases, inhibition of axon regeneration.  Causes  Reactive astrogliosis is a spectrum of changes in astrocytes that occur in response to all forms of CNS injury and disease. Changes due to reactive astrogliosis vary with the severity of the CNS insult along a graduated continuum of progressive alterations in molecular expression, progressive cellular hypertrophy, proliferation and scar formation. Insults to neurons in the central nervous system caused by infection, trauma, ischemia, stroke, recurring seizures, autoimmune responses, or other neurodegenerative diseases may cause reactive astrocytes. When the astrogliosis is pathological itself, instead of a normal response to a pathological problem, it is referred to as astrocytopathy.  Functions and effects  Reactive astrocytes may benefit or harm surrounding neural and non-neural cells. They undergo a series of changes that may alter astrocyte activities through gain or loss of functions lending to neural protection and repair, glial scarring, and regulation of CNS inflammation. = Neural protection and repair = Proliferating reactive astrocytes are critical to scar formation and function to reduce the spread and persistence of inflammatory cells, to maintain the repair of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to decrease tissue damage and lesion size, and to decrease neuronal loss and demyelination. Reactive astrocytes defend against oxidative stress through glutathione production and have the responsibility of protecting CNS cells from NH4+ toxicity. They protect CNS cells and tissue through various methods, such as uptake of potentially excitotoxic glutamate, adenosine release, and degradation of amyloid Œ≤ peptides. The repair of a disruption in the blood brain barrier is also facilitated by reactive astrocytes by their direct endfeet (characteristic structure of astrocytes) interaction with blood vessel walls that induce blood brain barrier properties. They have also been shown to reduce vasogenic edema after trauma, stroke, or obstructive hydrocephalus. = Scar formation = Proliferating reactive scar-forming astrocytes are consistently found along borders between healthy tissues and pockets of damaged tissue and inflammatory cells. This is usually found after a rapid, locally triggered inflammatory response to acute traumatic injury in the spinal cord and brain. In its extreme form, reactive astrogliosis can lead to the appearance of newly proliferated astrocytes and scar formation in response to severe tissue damage or inflammation. Molecular triggers that lead to this scar formation include epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), endothelin 1 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mature astrocytes can re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate during scar formation. Some proliferating reactive astrocytes can derive from NG2 progenitor cells in the local parenchyma from ependymal cell progenitors after injury or stroke. There are also multipotent progenitors in subependymal tissue that express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and generate progeny cells that migrate towards sites of injury after trauma or stroke. = Regulation of inflammation = Reactive astrocytes are related to the normal function of astrocytes. Astrocytes are involved in the complex regulation of CNS inflammation that is likely to be context-dependent and regulated by multimodal extra- and intracellular signaling events. They have the capacity to make different types of molecules with either pro- or anti-inflammatory potential in response to different types of stimulation. Astrocytes interact extensively with microglia and play a key role in CNS inflammation. Reactive astrocytes can then lead to abnormal function of astrocytes and affect their regulation and response to inflammation. Pertaining to anti-inflammatory effects, reactive scar-forming astrocytes help reduce the spread of inflammatory cells during locally initiated inflammatory responses to traumatic injury or during peripherally- initiated adaptive immune responses. In regard to pro-inflammatory potential, certain molecules in astrocytes are associated with an increase in inflammation after traumatic injury. At early stages after insults, astrocytes not only activate inflammation, but also form potent cell migration barriers over time. These barriers mark areas where intense inflammation is needed and restrict the spread of inflammatory cells and infectious agents to nearby healthy tissue. CNS injury responses have favored mechanisms that keep small injuries uninfected. Inhibition of the migration of inflammatory cells and infectious agents have led to the accidental byproduct of axon regeneration inhibition, owing to the redundancy between migration cues across cell types.  Biological mechanisms  Changes resulting from astrogliosis are regulated in a context-specific manner by specific signaling events that have the potential to modify both the nature and degree of these changes. Under different conditions of stimulation, astrocytes can produce intercellular effector molecules that alter the expression of molecules in cellular activities of cell structure, energy metabolism, intracellular signaling, and membrane transporters and pumps. Reactive astrocytes respond according to different signals and impact neuronal function. Molecular mediators are released by neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, endothelia, leukocytes, and other astrocytes in the CNS tissue in response to insults ranging from subtle cellular perturbations to intense tissue injury. The resulting effects can range from blood flow regulation to provision of energy to synaptic function and neural plasticity. Reactive astrocytes in a rat brain stained against GFAP. =Signaling molecules= Few of the known signaling molecules and their effects are understood in the context of reactive astrocytes responding to different degrees of insult. Upregulation of GFAP, which is induced by FGF, TGFB, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), is a classic marker for reactive gliosis. Axon regeneration does not occur in areas with an increase in GFAP and vimentin. Paradoxically, an increase in GFAP production is also specific to the minimization of the lesion size and reduction in the risk for autoimmune encephalomyelitis and stroke. =Transporters and channels= The presence of astrocyte glutamate transporters is associated with a reduced number of seizures and diminished neurodegeneration whereas the astrocyte gap junction protein Cx43 contributes to the neuroprotective effect of preconditioning to hypoxia. In addition, AQP4, an astrocyte water channel, plays a crucial role in cytotoxic edema and aggravate outcome after stroke.  Neurological pathologies  Loss or disturbance of functions normally performed by astrocytes or reactive astrocytes during the process of reactive astrogliosis has the potential to underlie neural dysfunction and pathology in various conditions including trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and others. Some of the examples are as follows: * Autoimmune destruction of astrocyte endfeet that contact and envelop blood vessels is associated with CNS inflammation and a form of multiple sclerosis * Rasmussen's syndrome autoantibody destruction of astrocytes causes seizures * In Alexander's disease, a dominant, gain-of- function mutation of the gene encoding GFAP is associated with macro- encephalopathy, seizures, psychomotor disturbances, and premature death. * In a familial form of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a dominant gain-of- function mutation of the gene encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD) leads to production of reactive astrocytes of molecules that are toxic to motor neurons. Reactive astrocytes may also be stimulated by specific signaling cascades to gain detrimental effects such as the following: * Exacerbation of inflammation via cytokine production * Production and release of neurotoxic levels of reactive oxygen species * Release of potentially excitotoxic glutamate * The potential contribution to seizure genesis * Compromise of blood-brain barrier function as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor production * Cytotoxic edema during trauma and stroke through AQP4 overactivity * Potential for chronic cytokine activation of astrocytes to contribute to chronic pain Reactive astrocytes have the potential to promote neural toxicity via the generation cytotoxic molecules such as nitric oxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species, which may damage nearby neurons. Reactive astrocytes may also promote secondary degeneration after CNS injury.  Novel therapeutic techniques  Due to the destructive effects of astrogliosis, which include altered molecular expression, release of inflammatory factors, astrocyte proliferation and neuronal dysfunction, researchers are currently searching for new ways to treat astrogliosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Various studies have shown the role of astrocytes in diseases such as Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, and Huntington's. The inflammation caused by reactive astrogliosis augments many of these neurological diseases. Current studies are researching the possible benefits of inhibiting the inflammation caused by reactive gliosis in order to reduce its neurotoxic effects. Neurotrophins are currently being researched as possible drugs for neuronal protection, as they have been shown to restore neuronal function. For example, a few studies have used nerve growth factors to regain some cholinergic function in patients with Alzheimer's. =Anti-gliosis function of BB14= One specific drug candidate is BB14, which is a nerve growth factor-like peptide that acts as a TrkA agonist. BB14 was shown to reduce reactive astrogliosis following peripheral nerve injuries in rats by acting on DRG and PC12 cell differentiation. Although further research is needed, BB14 has the potential to treat a variety neurological diseases. Further research of neurotrophins could potentially lead to the development of a highly selective, potent, and small neurotrophin that targets reactive gliosis to alleviate some neurodegenerative diseases. =Regulatory function of TGFB= TGFB is a regulatory molecule involved in proteoglycan production. This production is increased in the presence of bFGF or Interleukin 1. An anti-TGFŒ≤ antibody may potentially reduce GFAP upregulation after CNS injuries, promoting axonal regeneration. =Ethidium bromide treatment= Injection of ethidium bromide kills all CNS glia (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes), but leaves axons, blood vessels, and macrophages unaffected. This provides an environment conducive to axonal regeneration for about four days. After four days, CNS glia reinvade the area of injection and axonal regeneration is consequently inhibited. This method has been shown to reduce glial scarring following CNS trauma. =Metalloprotinease activity= Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and C6 glioma cells produce metalloproteinase, which is shown to inactivate a type of inhibitory proteoglycan secreted by Schwann cells.

The 4G6 gasoline engines were the favoured performance variant for Mitsubishi. The 4G61T powered their Colt Turbo, while the 4G63T, first introduced in the 1980 Lancer EX 2000 Turbo, went on to see service in the Sapporo and Starion coup√©s during the so-called \\"turbo era\\" of the 1980s, before creating for itself an illustrious motorsport heritage as the powerplant under the hood of the World Rally Championship-winning Lancer Evolution. A UK-market Evo known as the FQ400 had a version of the Sirius, making it the most powerful car ever sold by Mitsubishi. The 4D6 diesel engines supplemented the larger 4D5. Bore pitch is 93 mm. 4G61 The 4G61 displaces with bore/ full length stroke of . This engine was always DOHC 16-valve and used either Multi-point (MPFI) or Electronic Control (ECFI) fuel injection. A turbocharged version was also produced for the Mirage and Lancer.

Bore x stroke is SOHC and DOHC were produced. Both versions were available in either naturally aspirated and turbocharged form. For front-wheel drive applications, the turbocharged Sirius' name was changed to \\"Cyclone Dash\\". As fitted to the fifth generation Galant JIS gross were claimed - the output claims later shrank to - for the turbocharged and intercooled \\"Sirius Dash 3x2 valve\\" engine. This version could switch between breathing through two or three valves per cylinder, to combine high top-end power with low-end drivability as well as allowing for economical operation. It was a modification of Mitsubishi MCA-Jet technology which used a secondary intake valve to inject air into the engine for more efficient emissions control. The DOHC version was introduced in 1987 in the Japanese market Galant, and came in turbocharged or naturally aspirated form. It is found in various models including the 1988-92 Mitsubishi Galant VR-4, the U.S. market 1990-1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution I-IX. Later versions also received Mitsubishi's variable valve timing system, MIVEC. A SOHC carbureted eight-valve version (engine code G63B) was also available in Mitsubishi's pickup trucks (L200, Strada, Mighty Max, Dodge Ram 50) from the eighties until the mid-nineties. It produces at 5500 rpm in European trim (1989). The SOHC version was also used in Mitsubishi Galant models until 1993. It has of output and of torque at 4,750 rpm. Mivec Turbo 4G63 in a Lancer Evo IX Also, a SOHC version was produced until the late 90s and early 2000s and was used in Mitsubishi cars like the Montero and the 2.0 L 2-door Pajero with an output of at 4700 rpm. Also the N33 and N83 Spacewagon and Galant (UK market) received the 4G63, in single-cam sixteen-valve format. A similar version, with , was also used in some light duty Mitsubishi Canters from 1997 on. The Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser introduced the DOHC turbocharged intercooled version to the U.S. in 1989 through Diamond Star Motors, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Motors and the Chrysler Corporation. From 1990 to late April 1992 came thicker connecting rods and the use of six bolts to secure the flywheel to the crankshaft; May 1992 to 2006 Evolution versions have lighter rods and use seven bolts to secure the flywheel to the crankshaft. They are referred to as the \\"six bolt\\" and \\"seven bolt\\" engines, respectively. Output for the 2003 US Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is at 6500 rpm with of torque at 3500 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder head. It uses multi-point fuel injection, has four valves per cylinder, is turbocharged and intercooled and features forged steel connecting rods. The final version of the engine was found in Lancer Evolution IX. It was equipped with Mitsubishi's variable valve timing system, MIVEC. This version also had a revised turbocharger, extended reach spark plugs, two-piece rings. A SOHC 16 valve turbocharged version called 4G63S4T is produced by Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing (SAME) in Shenyang, China, producing a peak power of and a peak torque of . This version is equipped with a TD04 turbocharger. =Racing= Its turbocharged variant, G63T (also sometimes referred to simply as the 4G63), has powered Mitsubishi vehicles in World Rally Championships for years in the Mitsubishi Lancer EX 2000 Turbo, Mitsubishi Galant VR-4, Lancer Evolution, Carisma GT, and Lancer WRC04. It was the powerplant of the Lancer Evolution when Tommi M√§kinen won his four consecutive WRC championships in his Lancer. MHI and T-4 turbos were both used as power for these engines. A 1.7L variant of the 4G63 was also used in a custom made hill-climb McLaren F1(Known as McLaren F1 Evo) made by Komvet Racing. =Applications= * 1980‚Äì2003 Mitsubishi Galant * 1981‚Äì1987 Mitsubishi Lancer EX 2000 Turbo * 1982‚Äì1987 Mitsubishi Starion * 1983‚Äì1992 Dodge Colt Vista * 1983‚Äì1998 Mitsubishi Chariot * 1983‚Äì1989 Mitsubishi L200/Mighty Max * 1985 Proton Saga (Prototype) * 1985‚Äì1998 Mitsubishi Delica * 1987‚Äì1989 Dodge Ram 50 * 1987‚Äì1988 Hyundai Stellar - Engine also called : Hyundai Sirius engine (G4CP) * 1988 Mitsubishi Cordia * 1988 Mitsubishi Tredia * 1989‚Äì1992 Eagle Vista Wagon * 1990‚Äì1998 Eagle Talon * 1990‚Äì1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse * 1990‚Äì1994 Plymouth Laser * 1992‚Äì2005 Hyundai Sonata - Engine also called : Hyundai Sirius engine (G4CP) * 1992‚Äì2007 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution * 1993‚Äì1998 Mitsubishi Pajero * 1994‚Äì1998 Mitsubishi RVR * 1996‚Äì1999 Proton Perdana * 1997‚Äì2000 Mitsubishi Canter * 1998‚Äì2003 Hyundai Santamo - Engine also called : Hyundai Sirius engine (G4CP) * 1999‚Äì2005 Mitsubishi Dion * 2000‚Äì2008 Hyundai SantaFe - Engine also called : Hyundai Sirius engine (G4JS) * 2000‚Äì2004 Kia Joice - Engine also called : Hyundai Sirius engine (G4CP) * 2003‚Äì2005 Mitsubishi Airtrek * 2004‚Äì2010 Brilliance BS6 * 2006 Brilliance BS4 * 2006‚Äì2007 Lancer GT 2.0 * 2007‚Äì2015 Great Wall Coolbear * 2009‚Äì2012 Great Wall Haval H3 * 2009 Landwind X6 * 2011‚Äìpresent Landwind X8 4X2 2.0 * 2011‚Äì2013 Emgrand EC8 * 2014‚Äì2016 Zotye T600 * 2016‚Äì2017 Landwind X7 * 2016‚Äìpresent Zotye T700 * 2017‚Äìpresent Zotye SR9 * 2018‚Äìpresent Beijing BJ2022 Brave Warrior 4G64 The 4G64 is the second largest variant, at .

Output varies between at 5,250 rpm with of torque at 4,000 rpm in the Mitsubishi L200 and at 5,500 rpm with of torque at 4,000 rpm in the Chrysler Sebring/Stratus. The Chrysler version features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods. The DOHC and SOHC 16V 4G64 are interference engines, while the SOHC 8V 4G64 is a non interference engine. From March 1996 an LPG version with at 5,000 rpm was available in the Mitsubishi Canter. The 4G64 engine is very popular engine in China, where it still used on the Changfeng Liebao since 2002, a series of cars based on the Mitsubishi Pajero V20, and the Soueast Delica based on the Mitsubishi Delica van from 1996 to 2013. The 4G64 engine has been produced from Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd in Shenyang Liaoning on the north of China, where it was assembled through semi-knockdown kits in August 1998 and complete knockdown kits in September 1999.

It was available either naturally aspirated or turbocharged (with an air-to-air intercooler), and was used in most Mitsubishi diesel passenger cars in the eighties and beginning of the nineties. It was developed specifically to be transversally installed in front-wheel-drive cars, unlike the preceding 4D5-series which remained in production for commercial vehicles. The 1.8 TD power figures were comparable to those of the 22% larger 2.3 TD 4D55, with more low-down torque and while being much smoother. The cast-iron block was typical for Mitsubishi, but unusual for diesel engines, in being equipped with balance shafts.De Leener, p. 122 A number of installations combined this engine with four-wheel-drive. Some period critics were doubtful of the durability of the turbocharged engine, as the charger would spool up immediately (many turbodiesels have a thermostat which only allows the turbo to engage once the engine has warmed up) and a very short pre-heating period, leading to much noise and smoke in cold weather starts. =Applications= :4D65 (naturally aspirated) * 1983‚Äì1987 Mitsubishi Mirage/Colt/Lancer (C14) * 1985‚Äì1992 Mitsubishi Mirage/Lancer Van/Wagon (C14/C34) * 1987‚Äì1991 Mitsubishi Mirage/Colt/Lancer (C64/C74) :4D65T (turbocharged) * 1983-1989 Mitsubishi Galant/Galant Œ£/Eterna Œ£ (E14) * 1984-1991 Mitsubishi Chariot/Space Wagon (D09W) * 1987-1992 Mitsubishi Galant/Eterna (E34) * 1988‚Äì1991 Mitsubishi Lancer (C74, 4WD sedan only) * 1991‚Äì1995 Mitsubishi Lancer/Mirage/Libero (CB7, CD7) 4G67 The 16-valve DOHC 4G67 displaced .

It gives an account of the murder of a woman and her infant son by a man, in some versions, a disgruntled mason, in others, a devil, bogeyman or a motiveless villain. Versions of the ballad are found in Scotland, England and the US. According to Roud and Bishop (2012): > \\"Lambkin\\" is not one of the major league Child ballads in terms of > popularity, but it was widely known in England and Scotland, and even more > so in North America. ... The central character's name varies considerably, > including, in just the English versions 'Lambkin', 'Lamkin', Lincoln' and > 'Limkin\\", and he is various referred to as 'Long', 'Bold', 'Cruel' and > 'False'. They cite the analysis of Ann Gilchrist, who identified two threads: one Scottish, which retained the mason narrative; one Northumbrian, which lost the mason in early versions, thus encouraging singers to supply a different back- story. Versions collected in England stem from the Northumbrian thread. A bogeyman Other versions follow the same basic story, but the antagonist has many different names, among them \\"Long Lonkin\\", \\"Balankin\\", \\"Lambert Linkin\\", \\"Rankin\\", \\"Long Lankyn\\", and \\"Lammikin\\". Later versions lose the opening of the story, which explains that Lamkin is a mason who has not been paid; in these, Lamkin becomes a sort of a bogeyman who dwells in the wild places; the lord, before leaving, warns against him: :Says milord to milady as he mounted his horse, :\\"Beware of Long Lankin that lives in the moss.\\" :Says milord to milady as he went on his way, :\\"Beware of Long Lankin that lives in the hay.\\" These versions add peculiar incidents that add to the grisliness of the crime. Lamkin and the nursemaid collect the baby's blood in a basin which, along with the idea that the name Lamkin or Lammikin indicates the murderer was pale skinned and, therefore, perhaps a leper who sought to cure himself by bathing in the blood of an innocent collected in a silver bowl, a medieval cure. Performances *A version titled \\"Bolakins\\" was recorded as sung by Mrs. Lena Bare Turbyfill in 1939, Library of Congresshttps://www.discogs.com/Mrs- Lena-Bare-Turbyfill-I-G-Greer-With-Mrs-I-G-Greer-Bolakins-Lamkin-The-Three- Babes/release/10187600 * The song has been recorded as \\"Long Lankin\\" on But Two Came By (1968) by Martin Carthy. In this version a leading accomplice to the murder is the lady's false nurse, while her loyal handmaiden is an innocent bystander who reports the course of events to the returning lord. *The song \\"Bo Lamkin\\" was recorded by Appalachian folk musician Frank Proffitt. * In 1973 Northumbrian folk group The High Level Ranters recorded it as \\"Long Lonkin\\" on their album A Mile To Ride. * Steeleye Span recorded it as \\"Long Lankin\\" on Commoners Crown (1975). * Dave Burland recorded \\"Lamkin\\" on his album You Can't Fool The Fat Man (1979) with Nic Jones. * The Neofolk band Fire + Ice recorded \\"Long Lankin\\" on their album Gilded By The Sun (1992). *Tinkerscuss perform and recorded a version as Long Lankin on their album \\"Stonedancing\\" https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/tinkerscuss2 * Jim Moray recorded a version as \\"Long Lankin\\" on his album In Modern History (2010). * A version was recorded by English traditional singer Ben Butcher as \\"Cruel Lincoln\\" in 1955 and issued on The Voice of the People Vol, 3 in 1988. * The song \\"Lambkin\\" is included on the studio album Smoke of Home, the second album by the band Megson, released in 2007. * The Wainwright Sisters also included a recording of Long Lankin on their 2015 album Songs in the Dark. * Blackbeard's Tea Party's 2013 album Whip Jamboree features a version of the ballad. * For her 2016 album Lodestar, English folk singer Shirley Collins recorded a version of \\"Cruel Lincoln,\\" which draws from the Ben Butcher version. *Classical composer and librettist Fleur de Bray set the story of Long Lankin as an opera, which was premiered in August 2013 at the acclaimed London T√™te √† T√™te Opera Festival. * The 2018 Adult Swim series The Shivering Truth features variations of the ballad (titled \\"Long Lankin\\" in this case) sung by different artists over the end credits of every episode. * Martin Simpson 2019 released 'Beaulampkin' on compilation of Fernie Court Management Ltd.

The American poet Robert Lowell also referenced the song in the title of his Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of poetry Lord Weary's Castle (1946). The song inspired the young-adult novel Long Lankin (2011) by Lindsey Barraclough. A sadistic character named Lankin appears as a member of the Fairy Queen's court in Terry Pratchett's Lords and Ladies. Long Lankin appears in Jane Yolen and Midori Snyder's book Except The Queen.

It is a poorly known species due to its remote nesting habits, and it has not been extensively studied at sea either.Seto, N.W.H. (2001): Christmas Shearwater (Puffinus nativitatis). In: Poole, A. & Gill, F. (eds.): The Birds of North America 561. Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA & American Ornithologists' Union, Washington, D.C. (requires subscription) It is one member of a very ancient lineage of the small Puffinus species. Its only close living relative is the Gal√°pagos shearwater (P. subalaris). Taxonomy The species was described and given its current binomial name by the American naturalist Thomas Hale Streets in 1877. A genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA has shown that the closest living relative is the Gal√°pagos shearwater (Puffinus subalaris). Description The Christmas shearwater is a slender-bodied shearwater, about 36 cm long, with a wingspan of around 75 cm, and weighs around 350 g. It has dark plumage all over, generally blackish-grey with a rusty-brown tinge, slightly paler on the underside of the bird, and with some small edging of white under the chin and pale fringes to the upperwing coverts. It has brown- grey feet and a dark bill and eyes. Both sexes are alike, as are the young after fledging. Nestlings are covered in dark grey down feathers.Seto (2001), Shirihai et al. (2009) The species closely resembles the sooty (Puffinus griseus) and short-tailed shearwaters (P. tenuirostris), but has dark brown underwings and is smaller. The short tail of the Christmas shearwater does not appear blunt except when spread, but in flight usually tapers to a point, enhanced by the feet which protrude beyond the tail-tip. It often flies in a leisurely way like the related Procellariidae, and thus can be mistaken for a petrel. In particular, it can appear similar to the extremely rare Fiji petrel (Pseudobulweria macgillivrayi), a gadfly petrel-like relative of the shearwaters. The two species share a similar morphology and colouration, but the bulbous head and rather thin long bill - typical for shearwaters - distinguish P. nativitatis from the slim-headed thick-billed Fiji petrel. Distribution and habitat Breeding adult with its single egg, Eastern Island of Midway Atoll The Christmas shearwater nests on remote islands of the Central Pacific: the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Tuamotu, the Marshall Islands, Kiritimati (for which the species is named) and Sala-y-G√≥mez. It has become locally extinct on a number of islands, including Wake Island. Outside of the breeding season it ranges across the Pacific, having been recorded off the coast of Mexico and Guatemala in the east, and Bonin Islands in the west. Further south it is rare, having been recorded off Fiji only twice (one time in early to mid-May). Behaviour =Diet and feeding= Nestling in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Like its relatives it feeds at sea, predominantly on squid, and fish, mostly flying fish (Exocoetidae) and goatfish (Mullidae). It is highly pelagic and is dependent on predatory fish such as tuna driving prey to the surface. As mentioned above, it does not only have the dramatic stiff-winged \\"shearing\\" (dynamic soaring) flight technique which gave the shearwaters their common name. In addition to it, it may use the plesiomorphic flight technique of petrels and similar Procellariidae, moving about with slow, leisurely wingbeats. =Breeding= The Christmas shearwater nests on sandy islands with good cover. It nests on the surface, underneath dense cover (such as naupakas, Scaevola), or under rock outcroppings. It lays one white egg, the timing of laying varying from island to island, on some islands breeding throughout the year. The egg is incubated for around 50 days. The time taken to fledge varies depending on the season, ranging from 60 to 100 days. =Status and conservation= Although few specific studies have been conducted on the Christmas shearwaters, petrels and shearwaters are threatened worldwide by fishing, ingestion of plastic waste, and habitat degradation. For example, on Laysan Island the introduced rabbits degraded the scrub cover, leaving adults, chicks and eggs vulnerable to overheating, and introduced black rats took eggs and chicks. In 1985, the population on Sala-y-G√≥mez, a nature sanctuary, was estimated at 5,000. With its wide range and considerable numbers, the Christmas shearwater is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN.Seto (2001), BLI (2009) Footnotes  References  * Austin, Jeremy J.

It was founded by four women who got together in response to an article that was published in the magazine \\"Twentieth Century\\". The group published the Minorities Research Group Newsletter,Beckett, Elsa. Inventing Ourselves:Lesbian Life Stories, Eds: Hall‚ÄìCarpenter Archives Lesbian Oral History Group, Routledge 1988, , p68 and went on to publish its own lesbian magazine called Arena Three that provided a lifeline to remote lesbians around the country.p.95 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner The aims of the MRG were quoted as to \\"collaborate in research into the homosexual condition, especially as it concerns women; and to disseminate information to those genuinely in the quest of enlightenment\\".< Esme Langley, one of the groups key founders, was insistent that it should focus on research and be inclusive of heterosexuals and supportive of lesbian individuals. As well as lesbians, its members included social workers, psychiatrists and writers such as Iris Murdoch. The beginning The group was prompted by the article \\"A quick look at lesbians\\" by the journalist Dilys Rowe in late 1962. Although it would appear condemning in the present day, it discussed serious issues with interviews and quotations, and it prompted an interest in research into lesbian (and bisexual) lives. This research concept continued throughout the existence of the Minorities Research Group, which also provided a central point for formerly disparate individuals and information. Ultimately, the MRG provided education, support and opportunities to socialise for lesbians nationwide. In the media Many MRG members were also members of the Gateways clubp.122 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner in Chelsea, London, which featured in the film The Killing of Sister George. The Arena Three publication and the benefits of MRG membership were regularly promoted inside amongst its clientele and group meetings were sometimes held there.p.123 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner Other group members were located through small classified advertisements placed in British newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph. At first, many newspapers thought that their content was too offensive and refused to publish their adverts. The first to accept their adverts was The Sunday Times in May 1964 after it ran an article on the MRG.p.97-98 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner A further two articles were published in The Guardian and the News of the World later that year. This prompted a rush of enquiries and boosted membership from all over the country. Many of the members were married and had to get their husbands' written consent before they could join.p.98 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner In 1964, Esme Langley was interviewed by a psychiatrist for a late night Welsh television program.p.99 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner Shortly afterwards a documentary was made for This Week, the first national British television program on lesbians. This was broadcast on 7 January 1965, which featured several MRG members. Initially, the group had quite an impact on the press and on television which elevated the status of lesbians into something that could be discussed in ordinary society. Many women, including Esme Langley, volunteered to be interviewed and photographed for this purpose, risking loss of employment, abuse and loss of family connections.p.99-101 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner In 1971 a third television program about lesbians was made by Brigid Segrave called The important thing is love. This program also featured eight women from the MRG and was considered important as it was the first time that the women faced the camera without their identities being hidden.p.111-113 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner Group politics The Shakespeare's Head on Carnaby Street - March 2007 At one of the group debates in August 1964, a record 70 women turned up to discuss 'the freedom of dress'. This took place in a room above the Shakespeare's Head in Carnaby Street. Many of the women had been objecting to some women wearing the 'butch' attire of a suit and tie to meetings. This eventually led to long-term social divisions within the group where Butch women became excluded.p.118-120 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner The Shakespeare's Head also had another function as the home of the MRG lending library and reading group. Much of the lesbian literature of the time was not available through book stores and public libraries, so the MRG library was an invaluable resource of largely donated books and publications. This library was eventually passed to Kenric in 1966. The Minorities Research group had an active relationship with the American equivalent of the time period, Daughters of Bilitis. Some of the MRG members wanted to steer away from research to improve the social aspects of the group. They went on to found the still running lesbian social network Kenric, in 1965.p.96-97 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner Arena Three The Minorities Research Group was responsible for producing the monthly journal Arena Three, which was Britain's first Lesbian and Bisexual women's publication. This publication was produced from 1963 to 1972 and at its peak, it was distributed by mail order to approximately 500-600 subscribers. Arena Three was not available in the shops and was entirely funded by Esme Langley, some advertising and its subscribers. Arena Three was largely written by the same group of women and was often accused of being too middle class. It graduated from a type-written newsletter to a full glossy magazine by 1971. Maureen Duffy and Jackie Forster became regular contributors. A recent review of the magazine by Brighton Ourstory describes its contents as including letters from women around the country discussing local dances, events and the gay and lesbian politics of the day. Esme Langley Esme Langley (1919‚Äì1992)p.256 From the Closet to the Screen - Jill Gardiner was the founder, secretary and driving force of the Minorities Research Group. She was responsible for editing and producing the Mainland and Arena Three magazines. She also appeared in several early documentaries about lesbians, including The important thing is love released in 1971. Esme worked as a secretary and was working in the field of magazine publishing at the time when she started MRG. She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing to do at the time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called Why Should I be Dismayed under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post second world war era. The end After the legalisation of male homosexuality in the UK with the implementation of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 other more political organisations had appeared, such as the Campaign for Homosexual Equality which focuses on equal rights for all homosexuals. These superseded the objectives of Minorities Research Group and helped bring about its demise and evolution. The MRG ended with the final issue of Arena Three, which was published in March 1972. Former group member Jackie Forster, went on to start Sappho (magazine) in the same year. Jackie also went on to become an Executive member of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality and the Gay Liberation Front along with other former MRG members such as Maureen Duffy. Notable members * Jackie Forster was a broadcaster, an active member and wrote for Arena Three. * Maureen Duffy wrote for Arena Three and wrote The Microcosm. * Barbara Bell was the South Coast representative for MRG, as described in her biography Just Take Your Frock Off. Reference articles In summary, the article 'A Quick Look at Lesbians by Dilys Rowe' (Winter 1962‚Äì1963) was based on an interview with three self-confessed 'homosexual women' and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in families where they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond with their fathers during their formative years. Following on from this, a research article that was compiled with the help of the Minorities Research Group was 'On the Genesis of Female Homosexuality by E. Bene' for The British Journal of Psychiatry, September 1965, pp. 815‚Äì21. This included further research into the parental relationship by sampling 37 lesbians from the group and 80 married women. The results also pointed towards lesbians having a poor relationship with their fathers.

The word \\"transposase\\" was first coined by the individuals who cloned the enzyme required for transposition of the Tn3 transposon. The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by Barbara McClintock, who was studying the inheritance of maize, but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups. McClintock discovered that pieces of the chromosomes changed their position, jumping from one chromosome to another. The repositioning of these transposons (which coded for color) allowed other genes for pigment to be expressed. Transposition in maize causes changes in color; however, in other organisms, such as bacteria, it can cause antibiotic resistance. Transposition is also important in creating genetic diversity within species and adaptability to changing living conditions. During the course of human evolution, as much as 40% of the human genome has moved around via methods such as transposition of transposons. Transposases are classified under EC number EC 2.7.7. Genes encoding transposases are widespread in the genomes of most organisms and are the most abundant genes known.Aziz, R.K., M. Breitbart and R.A. Edwards (2010). Transposases are the most abundant, most ubiquitous genes in nature. Nucleic Acids Research 38(13): 4207-4217. Transposase Tn5 Transposase (Tnp) Tn5 is a member of the RNase superfamily of proteins which includes retroviral integrases. Tn5 can be found in Shewanella and Escherichia bacteria. The transposon codes for antibiotic resistance to kanamycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Tn5 and other transposases are notably inactive. Because DNA transposition events are inherently mutagenic, the low activity of transposases is necessary to reduce the risk of causing a fatal mutation in the host, and thus eliminating the transposable element. One of the reasons Tn5 is so unreactive is because the N- and C-termini are located in relatively close proximity to one another and tend to inhibit each other. This was elucidated by the characterization of several mutations which resulted in hyperactive forms of transposases. One such mutation, L372P, is a mutation of amino acid 372 in the Tn5 transposase. This amino acid is generally a leucine residue in the middle of an alpha helix. When this leucine is replaced with a proline residue the alpha helix is broken, introducing a conformational change to the C-Terminal domain, separating it from the N-Terminal domain enough to promote higher activity of the protein. The transposition of a transposon often needs only three pieces: the transposon, the transposase enzyme, and the target DNA for the insertion of the transposon. This is the case with Tn5, which uses a cut-and-paste mechanism for moving around transposons. Tn5 and most other transposases contain a DDE motif, which is the active site that catalyzes the movement of the transposon. Aspartate-97, Aspartate-188, and Glutamate-326 make up the active site, which is a triad of acidic residues. The DDE motif is said to coordinate divalent metal ions, most often magnesium and manganese, which are important in the catalytic reaction. Because transposase is incredibly inactive, the DDE region is mutated so that the transposase becomes hyperactive and catalyzes the movement of the transposon. The glutamate is transformed into an aspartate and the two aspartates into glutamates. Through this mutation, the study of Tn5 becomes possible, but some steps in the catalytic process are lost as a result. thumb There are several steps which catalyze the movement of the transposon, including Tnp binding, synapsis (the creation of a synaptic complex), cleavage, target capture, and strand transfer. Transposase then binds to the DNA strand and creates a clamp over the transposon end of the DNA and inserts into the active site. Once the transposase binds to the transposon, it produces a synaptic complex in which two transposases are bound in a cis/trans relationship with the transposon. In cleavage, the magnesium ions activate oxygen from water molecules and expose them to nucleophilic attack. This allows the water molecules to nick the 3' strands on both ends and create a hairpin formation, which separates the transposon from the donor DNA. Next, the transposase moves the transposon to a suitable location. Not much is known about the target capture, although there is a sequence bias which has not yet been determined. After target capture, the transposase attacks the target DNA nine base pairs apart, resulting in the integration of the transposon into the target DNA. As mentioned before, due to the mutations of the DDE, some steps of the process are lost‚Äîfor example, when this experiment is performed in vitro, and SDS heat treatment denatures the transposase. However, it is still uncertain what happens to the transposase in vivo. The study of transposase Tn5 is of general importance because of its similarities to HIV-1 and other retroviral diseases. By studying Tn5, much can also be discovered about other transposases and their activities. Tn5 is utilized in genome sequencing by using the Tn5 to append sequencing adaptors and fragment the DNA in a single enzymatic reaction, reducing the time and input requirements over traditional Next Generation Sequencing. This means of library preparation is used in the technique called ATAC-seq and also in Illumina dye sequencing. Sleeping Beauty transposase The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase is the recombinase that drives the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. SB transposase belongs to the DD[E/D] family of transposases, which in turn belong to a large superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases that includes RNase H, RuvC Holliday resolvase, RAG proteins, and retroviral integrases. The SB system is used primarily in vertebrate animals for gene transfer, including gene therapy,Aronovich, E.L., McIvor, R.S., and Hackett, P.B. (2011).

The engineered SB100X is an enzyme that directs the high levels of transposon integration. Tn7 transposon The Tn7 transposon is a mobile genetic element found in many prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), and was first discovered as a DNA sequence in bacterial chromosomes and naturally occurring plasmids that encoded resistance to the antibiotics trimethoprim and streptomycin. Specifically classified as a transposable element (transposon), the sequence can duplicate and move itself within a genome by utilizing a self-encoded recombinase enzyme called a transposase, resulting in effects such as creating or reversing mutations and changing genome size. The Tn7 transposon has developed two mechanisms to promote its propagation among prokaryotes. Like many other bacterial transposons, Tn7 transposes at low-frequency and inserts into many different sites with little to no site-selectivity. Through this first pathway, Tn7 is preferentially directed into conjugable plasmids, which can be replicated and distributed between bacteria. However, Tn7 is unique in that it also transposes at high-frequency into a single specific site in bacterial chromosomes called attTn7. This specific sequence is an essential and highly conserved gene found in many strains of bacteria. However, the recombination is not deleterious to the host bacterium as Tn7 actually transposes downstream of the gene after recognizing it, resulting in a safe way to propagate the transposon without killing the host. This highly evolved and sophisticated target-site selection pathway suggests this pathway evolved to promote coexistence between the transposon and it host, as well as Tn7's successful transmission into future generations of bacterium. The Tn7 transposon is 14 kb long and codes for five enzymes. The ends of the DNA sequence consists of two segments that the Tn7 transposase interacts with during recombination. The left segment (Tn7-L) is 150 bp long and the right sequence (Tn7-R) is 90 bp long. Both ends of the transposon contain a series of 22 bp binding sites that the Tn7 transposase recognizes and binds to. Within the transposon are five discrete genes encoding for proteins that make up the transposition machinery. In addition, the transposon contains an integron, a DNA segment containing several cassettes of genes encoding for antibiotic-resistance. The Tn7 transposon codes for five proteins: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TnsD, and TnsE. TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the Tn7 transposase enzyme TnsAB. The enzyme specifically recognizes and binds to the ends of the DNA sequence of the transposon, and excises it by introducing double-stranded DNA breaks to each end. The excised sequence is then inserted to another target DNA site. Much like other characterized transposons, the mechanism for Tn7 transposition involves cleavage of the 3' ends from the donating DNA by the TnsA protein of the TnsAB transposase. However, Tn7 is also uniquely cleaved near the 5' ends, about 5 bp from the 5' end towards the Tn7 transposon, by the TnsB protein of TnsAB. After the insertion of the transposon into the target DNA site, the 3' ends are covalently linked to the target DNA, but the 5 bp gaps are still present at the 5' ends. As a result, repair of these gaps leads to a further 5 bp duplication at the target site. The TnsC protein interacts with the transposase enzyme and the target DNA to promote the excision and insertion processes. The ability of TnsC to activate the transposase depends on its interaction with a target DNA along with its appropriate targeting protein, TnsD or TnsE. The TnsD and TnsE proteins are alternative target selectors that are also DNA binding activators that promote excision and insertion of Tn7. Their ability to interact with a particular target DNA is key to the target-site selection of Tn7. The proteins TnsA, TnsB, and TnsC thus form the core machinery of Tn7: TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the transposase, while TnsC functions as a regulator of the transposase's activity, communicating between the transposase and TnsD and TnsE. When the TnsE protein interacts with the TnsABC core machinery, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions into conjugable plasmids. When the TnsD protein interacts with TnsABC, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions downstream into a single essential and highly conserved site in the bacterial chromosome. This site, attTn7, is specifically recognized by TnsD.

When she was six, she was sent to boarding school in Britain at Wycombe Abbey and then to St Leonards School in Fife. During the Second World War, she played lacrosse and field hockey for Scotland. Forster became an actress and joined the Wilson Barrett repertory company in Edinburgh before moving to London in 1950. She attended the Arts Theatre Club was in various West End productions and films before developing a successful career as a TV presenter and news reporter under the name of Jacqueline MacKenzie. In 1957 she was on a lecture tour in North America for part of the year and was in Savannah, Georgia, when she had her first lesbian affair. Despite this she married author Peter Forster in 1958, but the marriage was over within two years as she accepted her true sexual identity. They divorced in 1962 and she went to live in Canada. Of her early lesbian experiences, she said \\"I didn't see myself as being a lesbian, or her, because I didn't look as I imagined they did, and nor did she. We weren't short back and sides and natty gent's suiting. I got the image from The Well of Loneliness, like we all did. There were drug stores around the States, with these pulp books, lurid stories about lesbians who smoked cigars and had orgies with young girls. I thought, where are these women? We never met anyone we knew were lesbians. There were no other books that I found about lesbians, no films that we ever saw: nothing at all.\\"p.34 From the Closet to the Screen ‚Äì Jill Gardiner In 1964, Forster returned to Britain to work for Border Television; and then eventually moved in with a girlfriend and her children in London.  Activism and legacy  In the 1960s Forster joined the Minorities Research Group and wrote for its journal Arena Three. She would also regularly promote the magazine in the Gateways club.p.122 From the Closet to the Screen ‚Äì Jill Gardiner Later on, she came out publicly in 1969 when she joined the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) and went to serve on its Executive Committee. She was in the first Gay Pride march in the UK in August 1971. In 1972 Forster was one of the founders of Sappho, which was a social group and one of the UK's longest- running lesbian publications (Sappho magazine was published from 1972 to 1981, although the group continued to meet regularly for many more years). The Sappho group members used to meet in the Chepstow pub in Notting Hill and had speakers such as Maureen Duffy and Anna Raeburn. After Sappho, Forster became a member of Greater London Council's Women's Committee. From 1992 until her death in 1998 Forster was an active member of the Lesbian Archive and Information Centre management Committee (now part of the Glasgow Women's Library). In 1997 a BBC film crew came to the archive to film her for a programme about her life which was to be part of The Day That Changed My Life series. Her work has made a huge impact on shaping the archive. On 6 November 2017, Google Doodle commemorated her 91st birthday.

From 1997 to 2008, the team was sponsored by the French bank Cr√©dit Agricole. Prior to 1997, the team was known as V√™tements Z-Peugeot (1987), Z-Peugeot (1988-89), Z (1990‚Äì92) and GAN (1993‚Äì96). In 1990, the team's leading cyclist, the American Greg LeMond, won the Tour de France. The team also won the team title at the Tour de France that year. Cr√©dit Agricole announced that they would cease to sponsor the team after 2008,Credit Agricole stops team sponsoring and the team was subsequently disbanded.  History  The team was born out of the Peugeot cycling team, which existed from the early 1900s to 1986. Roger Legeay was the Peugeot team's last manager, and he created V√™tements Z-Peugeot in 1987 (taking its name from the children's clothing brand Z and the car manufacturer Peugeot). That year, the team made its appearance at the Tour de France, with Frenchman Pascal Simon as its leading cyclist. In 1988, under the name of Z-Peugeot, the team achieved its first stage win at the Tour de France when J√©r√¥me Simon (Pascal Simon's brother) won stage 9 of the tour. The team's second stage win came in 1989, when the Scottish rider Robert Millar took a mountain stage. In 1990, the Tour's defending champion, Greg LeMond, moved to the team, which had been renamed Z. Riding for the team, LeMond won his third Tour title that year, coming in 2 minutes and 16 seconds ahead of the second-placed rider, the Italian Claudio Chiappucci. LeMond credited strong team support and tactics for his third Tour victory. And the team also won the team title at the year's Tour, coming in just 16 seconds ahead of the ONCE cycling team (the closest margin for the team classification in the Tour's history). Greg Lemond at the 1991 Tour de France In 1991, with the team renamed simply Z, LeMond wore the yellow jersey for five stages in the earlier part of the Tour, but faded as the event progressed and eventually finished in seventh place, 13 minutes behind the new champion, the Spanish rider Miguel Indurain. In 1992, LeMond struggled and eventually abandoned the Tour on the 14th stage. However the team picked up one stage win that year, with Jean-Claude Colotti winning stage 17. In 1993, the team was renamed GAN. LeMond did not ride in the 1993 Tour. He returned in 1994, but withdrew after six stages. Just prior to LeMond's departure the team acquired the British track cyclist Chris Boardman, a time trial specialist. Riding for the team, Boardman won the Prologue of the Tour de France in 1994, 1997 and 1998. The team also acquired a young Australian track rider, Stuart O'Grady, in the mid-1990s. He won several Tour stages and nearly won the points classification in the 2000 Tour de France. O'Grady held on to the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for many days during that same tour. The team was renamed Cr√©dit Agricole in 1997. German rider Jens Voigt joined the team until the 2003 season, winning a Tour stage and spending a day in the yellow jersey in 2001. Thor Hushovd riding in front of the Cr√©dit Agricole team car, when winning the prologue in the 2006 Tour de France The 2000 and 2001 seasons saw Americans Bobby Julich and Jonathan Vaughters in the team, making it the team with the most English speakers. The team also won the 2001 Tour de France team time trial in front of the ONCE and U.S. Postal teams. Julich and Vaughters left after one and two seasons respectively. The 2003 season saw the emergence of Thor Hushovd of Norway as the main sprinter of the team. At the end of 2003 O'Grady and Voigt left for Cofidis and Team CSC respectively. 2005 was successful for the team. Pietro Caucchioli finished in the top ten of the Giro d'Italia and Christophe Le M√©vel took a breakaway stage win. In the 2005 Tour de France Christophe Moreau was the highest-placed French rider (11th) and Thor Hushovd secured the green jersey points classification. In 2006, Cr√©dit Agricole captured the team classification at the Tour de Pologne. Hushovd took stage wins and two days in the yellow jersey at the Tour de France, won the Gent‚ÄìWevelgem classic, and a stage win and the points classification at the Vuelta a Espa√±a. From 2005 to 2008, the team was one of the 20 which competed in the UCI ProTour. The team disbanded at the end of the 2008 season when Cr√©dit Agricole ended their sponsorship.

It was originally based in western Uganda but has expanded into the neighbouring DRC. Since the late 1990s, the ADF has operated in the DRC's North Kivu province near the border with Uganda. While repeated military offensives against the ADF have severely affected it, the ADF has been able to regenerate because its recruitment and financial networks have remained intact. Some of the attacks it has been blamed for also appear to have been committed by other rebel groups as well as the Congolese Armed Forces. History =Establishment= The ADF was formed as merger of several rebel factions, including the Allied Democratic Movement, the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), the Uganda Muslim Liberation Army, and militant members of the Tablighi Jamaat movement.Prunier, 87. See Kirsten Alnaes, \\"Songs of the Rwenzururu Rebellion,\\" in P.H. Gulliver, ed., Tradition and Transition in East Africa (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969) The main figure of the group was Jamil Mukulu, a former Catholic who converted to Islam. The members were largely from central Uganda, in particular Iganga, Masaka, and Kampala, and portray themselves as religious crusaders. Beyond this vaguely stated religious ideology and statements that the government discriminates against Tablighis, the ADF has given few coherent rationales for their insurgency. The ADF chose western Uganda apparently for three reasons: terrain that is ideal for a rural insurgency, proximity to the DRC where the rebels could set up bases and recruit fighters, and the presence of some Ugandan ethnic groups unfriendly to the government that could offer assistance. It received support from the government of Sudan, which was engaged in disputes with the government of Uganda. =Further activity= Since the 2000s, the ADF has shown no commitment to its original goal of creating an Islamic state except to use it as a narrative to unite its members. By the late 2000s, its leaders had ceased making public proclamations, avoided media and harshly punished runaways. With their methods, the leadership managed to minimize any interactions that might reveal its objectives and activities. This also worked to their advantage, allowing them to survive despite repeated military attacks. While in-depth research explores the group's early years in Uganda, there has been hardly any in-depth academic analysis on its activities since it resurfaced in the Congo in 2010. Per Kristof Titeca, the lack of knowledge has also been exploited by some political players to craft the narratives for their own objectives. =Beni killings= A report of The Congo Research Group at New York University, released in September 2017, indicted the Congolese Army commanders of orchestrating the massacres in Beni from 2014 to 2016. It cited multiple witnesses saying that army commanders, including the former top general in the zone, supported and in some cases organized the killings. Sources told it that during some massacres, soldiers secured the perimeter so that victims could not escape. It stated that the first massacres were orchestrated in 2013 by former leaders of the rebel group Popular Congolese Army (APC), which fought in the Congo War of 1998-2003 to create a new rebellion and undermine confidence in the central government of DRC. These rebels were working with ADF per the report. However, when the massacres began, the army commanders co- opted many of the networks of the local militias to weaken their rivals. Activity =Insurgency= 2007 to 2008 During March 2007, the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) engaged incursive ADF groups in multiple firefights, killing at least 46 in Bundibugyo and Mubende districts. The biggest battle occurred on 27 March, when the UPDF faced an estimated 60 ADF troops and killed 34, including three senior commanders. The UPDF claimed to have retrieved numerous weapons as well as documents that tied the ADF to the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). On 13 April 2007, the UPDF and ADF engaged in an intense battle inside the Semuliki National Park, near the upscale Semliki Lodge tourist destination. Ceasefire and amnesty talks between the government of Uganda and the ADF were held in Nairobi starting in May 2008. Negotiations were complicated by the fragmentation of the ADF's leadership. Non-combatant dependents of the ADF were repatriated to Uganda by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). At least 48 ADF fighters surrendered and were given amnesty. As the threat from the LRA in the DRC waned, the UPDF put increasing focus on the ADF as a reason for UPDF personnel to remain in the DRC. 2013 resurgence and current situation 2011 to 2013 - Several hundreds of people were kidnapped in Beni, some by ADF and some by other armed groups. In April 2013, it was reported that ADF started a recruitment campaign in Kampala and other parts of the country. Citing a defector from ADF, AllAfrica.com reported that approximately ten new recruits joined ADF forces every day. In July 2013, the ADF renewed its fighting in the Congolese district of Beni. According to the UN Radio Okapi, the ADF together with the NALU fought a pitched battle with the Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), briefly taking the towns of Mamundioma and Totolito. On 11 July, the ADF attacked the town of Kamango, triggering the flight of over 60,000 refugees across the border into the Ugandan district of Bundibugyo. Early in September 2013, regional leaders under the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) asked the recently formed combative United Nations Force Intervention Brigade under the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to attack positions of foreign negative forces operating in the DRC, including the ADF. In late September 2013, 3 people were killed and 30 abducted during an ADF attack in the Watalinga Sector, North Kivu, DRC. Omar Kavota, the vice president and spokesman of the local civil society in North Kivu, condemned the abductions. According to the civil society, the abductees also included eight minors. In January 2014, the FARDC launched a major offensive against ADF forces in Beni. By April, Mukulu and other senior leaders of the group fled their headquarters camp from approaching FARDC forces. The remaining ADF fighters‚Äì alongside women and children ‚Äì retreated into the forest, where their numbers were significantly reduced in the following months as a result of starvation, desertion, and continued FARDC attacks. October to December 2014 - 250 people were killed for which ADF was solely blamed by the DRC government and MONUSCO. The Congo Research Group however stated that FARDC soldiers, former members of RCD‚ÄìK/ML as well as members of communal militias were also involved. December 2014 to January 2015 - Three Muslim clerics were killed by unknown assailants. Six alleged ADF members were arrested. However, the government did not show any evidence for ADF links. March 30, 2015 - An Ugandan government spokesman had initially blamed ADF and then al-Shabaab for assassination of government prosecutor Joan Kagezi, without offering evidence in either case. In late April 2015, the ADF's leader, Jamil Mukulu, was arrested in Tanzania. In July 2015, he was extradited to Uganda. The ADF has since been led by \\"Sheikh\\" Musa Baluku. As of November 2015, the number of attacks on Congolese forces continued, with weekly attacks of varying size taking place and killing more than 400 people in 2015, especially in the territories of Beni (North Kivu) and Irumu (Ituri). The ADF have been blamed for the 2016 Beni massacre and also for an attack in North Kivu on December 7, 2017, which killed 15 UN peacekeepers, all Tanzanians, as well as 5 Congolese soldiers. Foreign involvement The DRC government, citing civil society groups in North Kivu, says that Al-Shabaab fighters from Somalia are collaborating with the ADF. Uganda has claimed that there is a link between them with al-Shabaab and al-Qaeda. In-depth reports have denied this link, stating that there is contact but not real integration. MONUSCO has also accused it of having extensive links to international terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, al-Shabab, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, Boko Haram and Taliban. The Washington Post and World Policy Institute however have considered MONUSCO's single source as dubious. An Islamic State financier (Waleed Ahmed Zein) is also said to have paid the group at least once according to a report of the New York University‚Äôs Congo Research Group.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris. Background Snobelen was raised in Meadowlark, Ontario, and dropped out of high school in Grade 11\\\\. He eventually became a successful businessman, making a fortune in the waste-haulage business. He served as President of Jarsno Environmental Inc., Mid-Ontario Equipment Limited and the Cameron Group. Snobelen was also president of the Hunger Project in Canada, and an associate of the Carter Center, a human-rights organization started by former United States President Jimmy Carter. Politics Snobelen ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, placing third behind incumbent Liberal Steve Offer and a New Democrat in Mississauga North. In the provincial election of 1995, he ran in the same riding and defeated Offer by about 4,500 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 election, and Snobelen was appointed as Minister of Education and Training in Mike Harris's government on June 26, 1995. Shortly after his appointment, Snobelen was filmed arguing that the PC government needs to \\"bankrupt\\" and to create a \\"useful crisis\\" in the education system so as to initiate significant reforms. This controversy provoked several calls for his resignation, and further unsettled the relationship between the government and the teaching community, which were already tense after the previous NDP administration unilaterally imposed a Social Contract. In 1997, Snobelen introduced Bill 160, which gave the province control of municipal education taxes, introduced standardized testing, cut teaching preparation time, allowed the government to determine class sizes and granted early retirement initiatives to older, more experienced teachers. Critics argue that the purpose of this bill was to cut education spending, and reduce the power of the teachers' unions in order to privatize Ontario's public education system (Klein, N., The Shock Doctrine). The education restructuring, along with other cuts to government spending, was expected to significantly reduce the province's deficit. Community organizations, teachers and leaders of the provincial unions criticized the bill not only as an attack on local control of public schools and on union bargaining influence, but also as unnecessarily confrontational and as threatening the quality of Ontario's education system. Snobelen was moved to the Ministry of Natural Resources on October 10, 1997. Arguments with the teacher's unions and accusations that a high school dropout who didn't understand the education portfolio led to his transfer. Snobelen's increasingly hostile fight with the unions was the main reason that prompted Harris to shuffle his cabinet at this time. Shortly after his transfer, Ontario's public school teachers entered a two-week strike against the Harris government, with much of their anger directed against the reforms proposed by Snobelen. The Harris government argued that two million students were being held \\"hostage\\" by the strike and denounced the teachers for striking in violation of provincial labour laws. Some also criticized the teachers for using their work hours to participate in union activities. Teachers' representatives argued that they had no other viable options to oppose the proposed legislation. A provincial judge later determined that the provincial government did not meet its obligations in seeking to resolve the strike. Snobelen's successor as Minister of Education, David Johnson, implemented many aspects of Bill 160 after the strike. As Natural Resources Minister, Snobelen helped push through the Harris government's \\"Lands For Life\\" program, which protected 24,000 km¬≤ of public land in parks and conservation reserves, making them off-limit to industrial activity. He also cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt, a decision which was opposed by many Ontario hunters but supported by animal rights groups. He was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Bob Delaney in the redistributed riding of Mississauga West. He retained the Natural Resources portfolio after the election. Snobelen was dropped from cabinet when Ernie Eves succeeded Harris as Premier in 2002. In late 2002, it was reported that Snobelen was spending most of his time at a private cattle ranch in Oklahoma while still drawing a Member of Provincial Parliament's (MPP) salary. Faced with criticism, he returned to the legislature for most of the 2003 session and resigned his seat on March 17. =Cabinet positions= After politics On January 13, 2007, he was arrested in Milton, Ontario for the possession of an unregistered handgun. He was granted an absolute discharge in April 2008, though the judge noted that he had made a serious error in judgement. In 2012, Snobelen ran for the Presidency of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, finishing second to Richard Ciano.

Digitality (also known as digitalism) is used to mean the condition of living in a digital culture, derived from Nicholas Negroponte's book Being Digital in analogy with modernity and post-modernity. Overview Aspects of digitality include near continuous contact with other people through cell phones, near instantaneous access to information through the World Wide Web, third wave information storage (where any fragment in a text can be searched and used for categorization, such as through search engine Google), and communicating through weblogs and email.Franklin, Seb. ‚ÄúControl.‚Äù MIT Press, 3 Sept. 2015, mitpress.mit.edu/books/control. Some of the negative aspects of digitality include computer viruses and spam.Shelly, Gary B., and Misty E. Vermaat. Discovering Computers 2010: Living in a Digital World. 1 ed., Boston, MA, Course Technology Press, 2009.e With the rapidly growing technology, children at increasingly younger ages are learning to speak through the cyber world rather than in face-to-face conversation. They are becoming more digitally literate and creating a new culture in which they communicate more efficiently online than they do in person. Development In the 1990s, literature of the effects of interactivity with information began to be written and published, particularly focused on the immediacy and ubiquity of digital communications , and the interactivity and participatory nature of digital media.Hershman, Lynn. \\"The Fantasy Beyond Control.\\" Illuminating Video: An Essentail Guide to Video Art, 1990 While in the tradition of Postmodernism in that they presume a decisive role for media in the formation of personality, culture and social order,Bignell, Jonathan. Post Modern Media Culture. Akaar Books, 2000. they differ fundamentally from the analog critical theory, in that the audience has the ability to do more than create a personal idiolectic text, but instead is able to create new texts which reinforce the behavior of other participants.Landow, George P. Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization. 3rd ed., Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. This made it possible to individuals to express themselves through interactivity of digital media. Many works have been written outlining the fear of digitality. In the 1990s, the realization of digitality caused many artists to visualize and fear a future where analog would become completely extinct. They viewed digitalization as a deletion of the past.Swanstrom, Lisa. ‚ÄúExternal Memory Drives: Deletion and Digitality in Agrippa (A Book of The Dead).‚Äù Science Fiction Studies, vol. 43, no. 1, 2016, p. 14., . Although the computer was originally created to complete large scale computations, it ultimately progressed into a processing machine that could retrieve and interpret information very quickly. The first personal computer was first introduced by Ed Roberts in 1975 and this sparked the introduction of other \\"personal computers\\".Henderson, Harry. Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology. CRC Press, 2003. As technology continued to advance, more and more intelligent computers were coming to light with stronger processing power and wider range of utilities. This new age of technology lead to the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 which revolutionized the modern world. With the introduction of this World Wide Web people were able to more commonly access a data pool online with a trove of information. This information is now easily accessible from a Smartphone which can connect people from anywhere at any time. In the 21st century Digital technology plays an important role in 21st century life. In the United States, nearly two-thirds of people own smartphones. Using social networking services and online forums, people are able to communicate with other users, regardless of geographic region or time constraints. The rise of this type of interaction partly explains the significant increase in phone use in younger people, and mobile technology is mainly used for the purposes of communication. Digitalism is also slowly replacing many forms of physical aids, such as print encyclopedias and dictionaries, with people turning to newer technology for various needs. In his book, Nicholas Negroponte explains how necessities in the future will be digitized. For example, a large proportion of mass media (including newspapers and magazines) are becoming digitized, and a large percentage of financial transactions made in the United States are being made without the physical exchange of money (e.g. online). Computation is frequently discussed in debates on digitality. Modern theorists are now choosing to focus more on our relation to computers rather than the computers themselves as an important element of digitality.Boast, Robin. The Machine in the Ghost: Digitality and its Consequences. Reaktion Books Ltd, 2017.  Social media  Social media are computer generated tools that allow for people to convey their thoughts, ideas, or interests through digital communities or networks. Social media are online platforms for human interactions with local and global reach designed to circulate information. These platforms support social interactions and give rise to a complex interplay between communication, social practices, and technological infrastructure. (Login required.) This makes it so that everything is connected in real-time, and with these connections, people, information, data and events are instantly and globally spread. This allows for platforms like Twitter to be a media medium where there is an intersection of media and social interaction. Social media is different from social networks but is commonly looked at as the same which makes differentiating them harder. Social media is just that, media. Just like television and ads, social media has a great potential for business and marketing opportunities where companies can formulate custom promotions geared for specific audiences. Education Digitality in the 2000s has had a great impact in the world of education. The internet creates an abundance easily accessible and globally diverse resources. The digitization of textbooks and other written texts reduces the demand for the print versions. A vast majority of books now come with digital version of the text that allows for easier access from anywhere. This applies for scholarly textbooks, religious texts, books, and other texts that would normally have to be found in physical form. Digitalism has also made it so that children are now presented with electronic knowledge at a very early age, resulting in the increased implementation of electronics in school systems (for example in electronic learning, mobile learning, and blended learning). Students and academics alike have adopted social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and blogging platforms to expand the horizons for learning.  Intercultural communication  Intercultural communication is an important part of globalization. In the past intercultural communication was made difficult because of the distance separating different cultures. However, with modern-day technology and digitality, it is becoming increasingly possible to interact and learn about other cultures in an environment where people can openly speak. This interaction allows for people to compare and reflect upon both their own and different cultures. The internet creates platforms and forums where people from different backgrounds can develop intercultural communication skills and gain a cross-cultural abundance of knowledge. With the digitality of religious texts and cultural meetings, it is increasingly feasible to be submerged in a culture or religion without the need to travel to the source.

He has won 40 titles on the PBA Tour, including seven major championships, and another five titles (two of them majors) on the PBA50 Tour. A member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame, Duke is one of only three players in history to reach 40 career PBA Tour titles. He has bowled 73 perfect 300 games in PBA competition, including the 15th televised 300 game in PBA Tour history on January 5, 2003. A native of Mount Pleasant, Texas, Duke resides in Clermont, Florida, with his wife Karen. The two have a son named Branden. PBA Tour In 1983, not even one year after becoming a professional, Duke won the Cleveland Open in North Olmsted, Ohio, and became the youngest player ever to win a PBA Tour title, at 18 years and 345 days. On that day, Duke started from the No. 5 seed and worked his way up the stepladder, defeating the other four bowlers to take the championship, including a victory over the legendary Earl Anthony in Duke's first-ever televised match.Grossman, Hillard. \\"Duke gives fans on Merritt Island a glimpse of pro bowling royalty.\\" Article in Florida Today on August 9, 2010. In addition, Duke would not win his second title until 1991, but his career took off from there. He won two titles in the 1993 season, including his first major at the ABC Masters (now known as the USBC Masters). Norm completed perhaps his best season in 1994, winning five titles including his second career major, at the Tournament of Champions, and also winning PBA Player of the Year honors. He was also the winner of the PBA Player of the Year award in 2000, capturing three titles that year, including his third career major by winning the PBA World Championship. Duke became a member of the USBC Hall of Fame in 2002, and was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in January 2009. Duke currently owns 40 PBA Tour titles, including seven majors: one ABC Masters, one PBA Tournament of Champions, two United States Opens, and three PBA World Championships. By virtue of having won each of these four majors, Duke is one of only three bowlers in Tour history to complete the career Grand Slam, along with fellow Hall-of-Famer Mike Aulby and all-time major titles record holder Jason Belmonte. His 38th title on February 15, 2015 put him in sole possession of third-place on the PBA's all-time titles list. Duke's career PBA Tour earnings eclipsed $3 million in the 2011-12 season, making him just the third PBA bowler at the time (along with Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Pete Weber) to surpass the $3 million mark in career prize money.Schneider, Jerry. \\"Norm Duke Wins PBA Detroit Open Presented by Track for 35th Career Tour Title.\\" Article at www.pba.com on March 11, 2012. Parker Bohn III has since also joined the $3 million club. Duke's career earnings have now topped $3.6 million (as of 2019). Duke made multiple TV Finals appearances every season from 1990 through 2015. (He made only one TV finals appearance in 2016.) He has won at least two titles in a season nine times, including a career-best five titles in 1994.Norm Duke bio at www.pba.com, official site of the PBA Tour The diminutive Duke (he stands 1.65 meters, or 5-foot-5) is known for his exceptional versatility. He is generally thought of as a stroker, either throwing the ball relatively straight or playing a hook shot from the extreme outside of the lane. But he has also shown the ability (especially earlier in his career) to swing the ball out toward the gutter and bring it back like a cranker when necessary. This gives him the advantage of being able to score well on most of the PBA's multiple oil patterns. =2007-08 Season= The 2007-08 season started slowly for Duke, as he battled illness on top of a series of injuries through the first half. Standing 51st in points and with his Tour exemption in jeopardy, he put together a furious finish by winning two majors in the final five weeks of the season. On February 24, 2008, he won his second career PBA World Championship to lock up a 2008-09 exemption. Then on March 30, he won the U.S. Open and joined Mike Aulby and Billy Hardwick as the only bowlers to ever complete the coveted PBA \\"Grand Slam,\\" in which a PBA bowler wins the U.S. Open, World Championship, Tournament of Champions, and USBC Masters at least once. He is also one of only six bowlers to complete the PBA career Triple Crown, in which a PBA bowler wins the U.S. Open, Tournament of Champions, and World Championship. =2008-09 Season= Duke began the 2008-09 season by, again, winning the PBA World Championship. Continuing on his success from the previous season's sweep of the final two majors, he accomplished something never before done by any professional bowler: win three consecutive major tournaments. The streak ended when he failed to make the TV finals for the 2009 Tournament of Champions. On April 5, 2009, Duke narrowly missed an opportunity to become just the fifth bowler to repeat as champion at the U.S. Open. He qualified as the #1 seed, but was upset in the final by Mike Scroggins, 191‚Äì173. Duke eventually did win a second U.S. Open on February 27, 2011. =Later career= Duke's 37th title on the PBA Tour came in 2012 at the Dick Weber PBA Playoffs. He joined the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) in 2014, while continuing to compete in selected events on the standard PBA Tour. His 38th title on the standard PBA Tour came in the 2014 Mark Roth- Marshall Holman PBA Doubles Championship, where he partnered with Wes Malott for the win. He captured his 39th PBA title on February 24, 2019 at the PBA Indianapolis Open, defeating Jason Belmonte in the title match. A month shy of his 55th birthday, Duke became the third oldest player to win a standard PBA Tour event, behind John Handegard (57) and Buzz Fazio (winner of two titles at age 56). One week later, he won his 40th PBA Tour title at the PBA Jonesboro Open, becoming the third player in history to win 40 PBA Tour titles (after Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Earl Anthony). It was also the first time in Duke's career that he had ever won PBA titles in back-to-back weeks. A testament to Duke's versatility, both victories were on mixed lane conditions, with the left lane and right lane featuring different lengths and layouts of oil. In 2019, Duke posted the most cashes (20) and match-play appearances (17) on the PBA Tour since his 2005 season, and his highest earnings since 2008. PBA50 Tour In 2014, Norm won two PBA50 titles, including the Senior U.S. Open, in his first season on the PBA50 Tour. For his efforts, he won both PBA50 Rookie of the Year and PBA50 Player of the Year honors. He is one of only two PBA50 players (with Tom Baker) to win both awards in the same season. In 2016, he won his third PBA50 title and second PBA50 major at the PBA50 World Championship. He has since won two more standard titles on the PBA50 Tour, in 2017 and 2018.

CARINE (Computer Aided Reasoning engINE) is a resolution based theorem prover initially built for the study of the enhancement effects of the strategies delayed clause-construction (DCC) and attribute sequences (ATS) in a depth- first search based algorithm [Haroun 2005]. CARINE's main search algorithm is semi-linear resolution (SLR) which is based on an iteratively-deepening depth- first search (also known as depth-first iterative-deepening (DFID) [Korf 1985]) and used in theorem provers like THEO [Newborn 2001]. SLR employs DCC to achieve a high inference rate, and ATS to reduce the search space. Delayed Clause Construction (DCC) Delayed Clause Construction is a stalling strategy that enhances a theorem prover's performance by reducing the work to construct clauses to a minimum. Instead of constructing every conclusion (clause) of an applied inference rule, the information to construct such clause is temporarily stored until the theorem prover decides to either discard the clause or construct it. If the theorem prover decides to keep the clause, it will be constructed and stored in memory, otherwise the information to construct the clause is erased. Storing the information from which an inferred clause can be constructed require almost no additional CPU operations. However, constructing a clause may consume a lot of time. Some theorem provers spend 30%-40% of their total execution time constructing and deleting clauses. With DCC this wasted time can be salvaged. DCC is useful when too many intermediate clauses (especially first-order clauses) are being constructed and discarded in a short period of time because the operations performed to construct such short lived clauses are avoided. DCC may not be very effective on theorems with only propositional clauses. How does DCC work? After every application of an inference rule, certain variables may have to be substituted by terms (e.g. x-> f(a)) and thus a substitution set is formed. Instead of constructing the resulting clause and discarding the substitution set, the theorem prover simply maintains the substitution set along with some other information, like what clauses where involved in the inference rule and what inference rule was applied, and continues the derivation without constructing the resulting clause of the inference rule. This procedure keeps going along a derivation until the theorem provers reaches a point where it decides, based on certain criteria and heuristics, whether to construct the final clause in the derivation (and probably some other clause(s) along the path) or discard the whole derivation i.e., deletes from memory the maintained substitution sets and whatever information stored with them. Attribute Sequences (ATS) (An informal definition of) a clause in theorem proving is a statement that can result in a true or false answer depending on the evaluation of its literals. A clause is represented as a disjunction (i.e., OR), conjunction (i.e., AND), set, or multi-set (similar to a set but can contain identical elements) of literals. An example of a clause as a disjunction of literals is: ~wealthy(Y) \\\\/ ~smart(Y) \\\\/ ~beautiful(Y) \\\\/ loves(X, Y) where the symbols \\\\/ and ~ are, respectively, OR and NOT. The above example states that if Y is wealthy AND smart AND beautiful then X loves Y. It does not say who X and Y are though. Note that the above representation comes from the logical statement: For all Y, X belonging to the domain of human beings: wealthy(Y) /\\\\ smart(Y) /\\\\ beautiful(Y) => loves(X,Y) By using some transformation rules of formal logic we produce the disjunction of literals of the example given above. X and Y are variables. ~wealthy, ~smart, ~beautiful, loves are literals. Suppose we substitute the variable X for the constant John and the variable Y for the constant Jane then the above clause will become: ~wealthy(Jane) \\\\/ ~smart(Jane) \\\\/ ~beautiful(Jane) \\\\/ loves(John, Jane) A clause attribute is a characteristic of a clause. Some examples of clause attributes are: \\\\- the number of literals in a clause (i.e., clause length) \\\\- the number of term symbols in a clause \\\\- the number of constants in a clause \\\\- the number of variables in a clause \\\\- the number of functions in a clause \\\\- the number of negative literals in a clause \\\\- the number of positive literals in a clause \\\\- the number of distinct variables in a clause \\\\- the maximum depth of any term in all the literals in a clause Example: the clause C = ~P(x) \\\\/ Q(a,b,f(x)) has a length of 2 because it contains 2 literals 1 negative literal which is ~P(x) 1 positive literal which is Q(a,b,f(x)) 2 constants which are a and b 2 variables (x occurs twice) 1 distinct variable which is x 1 function which is f maximum term depth of 2 5 term symbols which are x,a,b,f,x An attribute sequence is a sequence of k n-tuples of clause attributes that represent a projection of a set of derivations of length k. k and n are strictly positive integers. The set of derivations form the domain and the attribute sequences form the codomain of the mapping between derivations and attribute sequences. Example: <(2,2),(2,1),(1,1)> is an attribute sequence where k=3 and n=2. It corresponds to some derivation, say, <(B1,B2),(R1,B3),(R2,B4)> where B1, B2, R1, B3, R2, and B4 are clauses. The attribute here is assumed to be the length of a clause. The first pair (2,2) corresponds to the pair (B1,B2) from the derivation. It indicates that the length of B1 is 2 and the length of B2 is also 2. The second pair (2,1) corresponds to the pair (R1,B3) and it indicates that the length of R1 is 2 and the length of B3 is 1. The last pair (1,1) corresponds to the pair (R2,B4) and it indicates that the length of R2 is 1 and the length of B4 is 1. Note: An n-tuple of clause attributes is similar (but not the same) to the feature vector named by Stephan Schulz, PhD (see E equational theorem prover).

At 12:00pm on September 16, 2011, \\"Magic 98.9\\" moved to sister station WJYD, displacing the urban gospel format (\\"Joy 106.3\\"). 98.9 then flipped to variety hits, branded as \\"98-9 Jack FM.\\" The first song on \\"Jack FM\\" was \\"Cum on Feel the Noize\\" by Quiet Riot. On September 23, 2011, WXMG changed their call letters to WJKR (at the same time, the WXMG calls moved to WJYD). The station was one of three non-urban radio stations owned by Radio One (the others being all- news KROI/Houston and Top 40 WNOU/Indianapolis), until the company sold it on October 23, 2012, to Salem Communications.Radio-One Sells 98.9 WJKR Columbus To Salem from Radio Insight (October 23, 2012) On November 1, 2012, at approximately 12:01 am, \\"Jack FM\\" signed off after playing \\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It\\" by R.E.M.. Salem Communications took over after a few seconds of dead air with a speech from Ronald Reagan, with the official launch of \\"98.9 The Answer\\" at 6 that morning. On February 15, 2013, WJKR changed their call letters to WTOH. The \\"Jack FM\\" format and WJKR callsign returned to Columbus on July 24, 2013 when WMNI-FM flipped from a simulcast of then sister station News/Talk WMNI (who flipped to adult standards 6 days earlier) back to Adult Hits as \\"103.9 Jack FM\\". The station had originally carried the format as WTDA \\"103.9 Ted FM\\" from 2005-2007. HD Radio 95.9 The Fish's logo WTOH also broadcasts in HD Radio.

The sett was first published in 1831 in the book The Scottish Gael by James Logan. Officially, the tartan is worn by the pipers of the Black Watch, Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, and the Scots Guards, as well as a select few civilian groups. The 5th Bolton Scout Group and the 5th Potters Bar Scout Group wear the scarf (neckerchief/necker) officially, with permission from the Queen, and the Queen's Bands (of Queen's University) wear the tartan as part of their official uniforms. So too do the Winnipeg Police Pipe Band. The tartan may also be worn by members who took part in a patrol leaders training course. Depiction of the helmet of Jackie Stewart with the Royal Stewart tartan Theoretically, this tartan should not be worn without the express permission of the Queen. However, the Scottish Register of Tartans observes that in practice, due to its popularity, it has become a universal tartan, which can be worn by anyone who doesn't have their own clan tartan. \\"In the same way that clansmen wear the tartan of their chief, it is appropriate for all subjects of the Queen to wear the Royal Stewart tartan.\\" Colin W Hutcheson attributes this universalisation to \\"commercialisation in recent times\\"; traditionally, the Black Watch (darkened Old Campbell) and Hunting Stewart tartans were used as universal tartans requiring no permission. In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, Royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish shortbread.Marketing\\". p. 9. Haymarket Press, 1973 In the 1960s, the tartan became well known in motor racing circles, as three-time Formula One world champion Jackie Stewart from Scotland used a distinctive band of Royal Stewart tartan around his crash helmet. In the late 1970s, the Royal Stewart tartan became popular in punk fashion.

For over two decades, his career title count was listed as 41. The count was amended to 43 in 2008, when the PBA chose to retroactively award PBA titles for ABC Masters championships if won by a PBA member at the time.All-time title leaders at www.pba.com He is widely credited (along with Dick Weber) for having increased bowling's popularity in the United States. He was the first bowler to earn over $100,000 in a season (1975), and the first to reach $1,000,000 in lifetime PBA earnings (1982). His ten professional major titles‚Äîsix PBA National Championships, two Firestone Tournament of Champions titles, and two ABC Masters (now USBC Masters) titles‚Äîare the second most all time, tied with Pete Weber and three behind Jason Belmonte. Never brash or flashy in a crew-cut and plastic-frame \\"marshwood\\" style eyewear (which he abandoned for more modern frames later in his career), Anthony was dubbed \\"Square Earl\\" by fellow pro bowlers.Goldstein. A new biography of Earl (focusing more on his bowling career but with a few personal insights) was published in October 2019 by Luby Publishing. Compiled by sportswriter Barry Sparks, it is titled Earl: The Greatest Bowler of All Time. PBA career Anthony's bowling career began when he hesitantly joined his company's bowling league, West Coast Grocery, after serving in the United States Air Force. After his first season bowling, Earl achieved his first official league bowling average of 165. By his third season, his average had surged to 217. In 1963, he bowled three PBA summer tournaments in the Pacific Northwest to get a feel for what it would take to successfully compete on the tour. Though he did not cash in any of the three events, he had succeeded in learning how much he would need to improve before he could entertain any idea of going out on the PBA Tour full-time. In order to prepare himself for the tour Anthony practiced between 300-350 games a week, up to eight hours day, and often without any pins (in order to save money). After six years of diligent practice Anthony began his professional bowling career in January 1970, leading the tournament going into the televised finals at Crestview Bowl in Wichita, Kansas. He lost the championship match to Skee Foremsky, finishing in second place. Anthony won the first of his 43 PBA titles on June 7, 1970, when he defeated Allie Clarke at the Heidelberg Open in Seattle, Washington. His final PBA title was a major ‚Äî the 1983 Toledo Trust PBA National Championship. Six of his titles were achieved by a pair of improbable \\"three-peats\\" in the PBA National Championship, the first three from 1973‚Äì75 and the other three from 1981‚Äì83. Earl also finished runner-up to fellow lefty Mike Aulby in the 1979 PBA National Championship. After a nine-month layoff, Anthony won his second ABC Masters tournament in 1984, which at the time was not part of the PBA Tour. Anthony had also won the Masters in 1977. The PBA later added ABC Masters titles as PBA titles, giving Anthony at least one PBA title in 15 consecutive seasons (1970‚Äì84). He joined the Senior Tour in 1988 and accumulated another seven titles there. By 1988 Anthony had 25 career 300 games. Sadly, not one was on television in the United States; he did, however, bowl two televised 299 games, leaving a solid 9-pin on the last shot in one and a 6-pin on the other. Although he didn't drop to the floor like Don Johnson, Anthony would remark about the 9-pin on a PBA telecast years later, saying, \\"to this day, I can't believe that pin stood.\\" Earl Anthony did shoot a televised 300 game on national TV in a PBA Tournament in Japan in front of over 50 million viewers.Photo of Earl Anthony holding trophy for shooting 300 on live TV in Japan PBA Tournament After retiring, Anthony moved to the broadcast booth as a color commentator and operated a bowling center in Dublin, California. Personal life and death Anthony was born in Tacoma, Washington to Earl Anthony and Laura Davis. He was a minor league baseball pitcher with the Baltimore Orioles organization before his days as a professional bowler. He was also an excellent golfer, achieving a near-scratch handicap at the age of 60. He once set the course record at Crow Canyon Country Club in Danville, California with a scratch score of 64.Signed and attested scratch 64 golf score by Earl AnthonySigned and attested scratch 64 golf score by Earl Anthony He was married to Susie Anthony; and had a son, Mike, and two daughters, Tracy and Jeri.Earl Anthony, 63, Bowling's First $1 Million Man, Dies New York Times, 8/16/2001 Anthony missed some time on the PBA Tour during the 1978 season after suffering a heart attack in June of that year. Less than three months later he was back on Tour, finishing third in the Waukegan (IL) Open. Earl Anthony died in 2001, succumbing to head injuries suffered after falling down a flight of stairs at his friend Ed Baur's home in New Berlin, Wisconsin. He was 63 years old. The \\"Earl Anthony Memorial Scholarship Fund\\" was established through funding by the ABC Championship Tournament, in order to provide scholarships to young bowlers. It is now administrated by the Bowling Foundation. In January 2002, the PBA began the year with a tournament named after Anthony, \\"The Earl Anthony Memorial Classic.\\" It was first held at TechCity Bowl in Kirkland, Washington. It was won by left-handed pro bowler Parker Bohn III, who beat Patrick Healey, Jr. in the final match 235 to 215. It later moved to Medford, Oregon and re-titled as \\"The Earl Anthony Medford Classic.\\" In 2010 and 2011, the event took place in Dublin, California and was titled the Earl Anthony Memorial. Legacy Anthony was voted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1981 and the ABC Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000 he was voted \\"Master of the Millennium\\" by a wide margin in a nationwide vote conducted by Bowling Magazine. In a Sports Illustrated Magazine national vote he was named the 2nd Greatest Athlete in the history of the State of Washington (behind only former Gonzaga and NBA star John Stockton). The late bowling legend Dick Weber dubbed Anthony \\"the greatest speed-control bowler ever.\\" When Anthony won the 1978 Tournament of Champions to become the first bowler to ever reach 30 titles, Weber was in the broadcast booth and proclaimed Anthony to be \\"the undisputed King of Bowling.\\"Thomas, Jason. \\"Top 10 Moments in T of C History.\\" Article at www.pba.com on August 16, 2010. Earl's record of 41 titles stood for 23 years before it was broken by Walter Ray Williams Jr. in 2006,\\"PBA Hall of Fame: Earl Anthony\\" though it increased to 43 in 2008 when the PBA started including ABC Masters titles if they were won by a PBA member. In 14 seasons, Anthony made the top five for the televised final round a record 144 times. Said Bowlers Journal editor Jim Dressel, \\"When Earl was in the house, everybody else knew there were only four other spots for TV.\\" In 2008, the PBA celebrated fifty years in existence by commissioning a panel of experts to rank the \\"50 Greatest Bowlers of the Last 50 Years.\\" Anthony was ranked #1 on the list over Walter Ray Williams Jr., despite the fact that Williams had broken many of Anthony's records. However, Williams himself said, \\"I feel Earl's record is better than mine because it was more condensed. Earl bowled 14 years and 400 or so events. I‚Äôve bowled well over 600 by now, maybe 700.\\" Williams also added, \\"When Earl Anthony retired, he didn't have anyone to push him. He probably would have kept going to 50 if that were the case. It's hard to say what would've happened then.\\"\\"The Jordan of ... Bowling.\\" Article in ESPN the Magazine on March 26, 2008.

The first Clock King was a villain and enemy of Green Arrow, and debuted in World's Finest Comics #111 (August 1960), and was created by France Herron and Lee Elias. The Clock King made his first live-action appearance in the 1960s Batman TV series, played by Walter Slezak. The character was later played by Robert Knepper, appearing in episodes from the Arrow's second season and The Flash. Publication history The first Clock King was originally an enemy of Green Arrow. He has no superpowers or abilities. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it. Clock King is a master planner and sometimes uses clock-themed gadgetry. The Clock King became more recently better known by his appearances in Justice League International and Suicide Squad. Fictional character biography =William Tockman= Born William Tockman, the Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. During one day, he finds out from a doctor's visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister's future, he watches the timing of a local bank's vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by the Green Arrow. While he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further and hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on both the Green Arrow and the incompetent doctor. With several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the Injustice League, a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers.Justice League International (vol. 1) #23 (January 1989) The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the Justice League International, at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team Justice League Antarctica. This JLA includes G'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team.Justice League America Annual #4 (October 1990) Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of Maxwell Lord, partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound.Justice League America (vol. 1) #53 (August 1991) The villains again later reunite as the Injustice League as henchmen of Sonar.Justice League Europe #49-50 (April- May 1993) Later, the Clock King leads his own separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia, and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a Metropolis toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the Teen Titans, the heroes Booster Gold and Firehawk and DEO agent Cameron Chase. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock King's team and they are all imprisoned. Clock King himself escapes on another bus.Chase #4 (May 1998) Still later, Clock King and his Injustice League friends are transformed into the new Suicide Squad. They are sent to a remote research facility where a genetic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned \\"children\\" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, Major Disaster believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out Cluemaster, shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring.Suicide Squad (second series) #1 Multi- Man also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying. Clock King is not seen for a period of time after Infinite Crisis. In an issue of 52, one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone \\"ending up like Time Commander and Clock Queen\\". =Tem= A new Clock King appears in Teen Titans #56 as the head of a team of villains named the Terror Titans. In an interview with Teen Titans writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as \\"... Very smart. He sees things differently than others\\". Although his full name has not been confirmed, Disruptor did refer to him as \\"Tem\\" before being killed. His costume is similar to the suit worn by the Clock King seen in Batman: The Animated Series, although with clock faces on the tie and lapel. After his group defeats and captures Kid Devil,Teen Titans (vol. 3) #56 (April 2008) Clock King conditions the heroTeen Titans (vol. 3) #58 (June 2008) to be sold as a fighter to a group called \\"The Dark Side Club\\".Teen Titans (vol. 3) #59 (July 2008) Clock King then brings the Titans to his base of operations, a dimension outside of time. After besting Robin, Clock King is stymied by Ravager, who possesses similar precognitive abilities.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #60 (August 2008) He offers Ravager a chance to join him, but she refuses. Clock King then removes the Titans from his base and decides to move on to new plans. Ravager ultimately reconsiders his earlier offer. In the Terror Titans miniseries, Clock King takes over the Dark Side Club, and uses it to brainwash young metahumans, turning them into his very own \\"Martyr Militia\\". He sends the Militia to attack Los Angeles, for no reason other than to amuse him.Terror Titans #5 (April 2009) Clock King's plans are eventually undone by Miss Martian, who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.Terror Titans #6 (May 2009) =The New 52= In The New 52, three different Clock Kings were shown existing: * Billy Tockman is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle. Tockman owns a nightclub called the Midnight Lounge, and vintage clock repair shop called the Clock King, which he uses as a front for his operations.Green Arrow (vol. 5) #22 (September 2013) While Green Arrow is off dealing with The Outsiders, Diggle, along with Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, talk Tockman into taking down Richard Dragon, to which he agrees. When they meet to take down Dragon, Tockman betrays them, claiming Dragon made a better offer.

This new version claims to be a temporal anomaly and feeds on the life force of others to maintain his youth, which led to him preying on African citizens. He is sheltered within the African nation of Buredunia under dictator Matthew Bland. His actions drew the attention of Deathstroke the Terminator, who was assigned by Bland to kill Clock King as revenge for his murders. However, Clock King managed to save his life by revealing that the warlord would kill Deathstroke after he'd finished the job. He later kidnaps Bland. During the fight, Slade shoots him, revealing his powers to be special effects. Furthermore, Clock King revealed that as a time anomaly, he saw that as a result of Dr Manhattan's manipulation of the timestream led to the rebirth of Deathstroke's ally Wintergreen. With that information, Deathstroke spared Clock King's life.Deathstroke: Rebirth & Deathstroke (vol. 4) #1 * A former engineer and drug dealer in a suit, sporting glasses inherited from his grandfatherNightwing #24-25 and a tattoo of a clock and arrow on the side of his head.

He is seen tinkering with his clocks as the ship sinks.Nightwing (2016) #22-28 Powers and abilities * The original Clock King has no metahuman powers or abilities, although he is athletic and extraordinarily smart. He extensively uses clock and time -related gimmicks to devastating effect. * The second Clock King has the always-active ability to see what is about to happen four seconds or so into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent's every move. He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti- gravity platform, all of them modelled after timepieces. Other versions =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Clock King is imprisoned in military Doom prison. During the prison break, Clock King joined Heat Wave and Plastic Man to retrieve his weapons.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #2 (July 2011) =Batman '66= In Batman '66 issue 4, the Clock King of the 60's series appears as a secret collaborator to the Mad Hatter's latest scheme.

Robert Knepper as William Tockman in Arrow. * In the 1960s Batman TV series, the Clock King was portrayed by Walter Slezak in the season two consecutive episodes, \\"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes\\" and \\"The Clock King Gets Crowned\\", which ABC transmitted on October 12 and October 13, 1966. The two-parter was written by Batman co-creator Bill Finger and Charles Sinclair and directed by James Neilson. In the episode, the Clock King, disguised as a pop artist, tries to rob a gallery of a time-related surrealist painting. Batman and Robin are stuffed into the bottom of an oversized hourglass, stripped of their utility belts, and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches, only for the duo to escape the trap later. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic-powered Cesium clock. As the Clock King, Slezak wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons such as \\"Super Slick Watch Oil\\", \\"Knock Out Gas\\", and \\"Super Sonic Sound\\". * The William Tockman version of Clock King is featured in multiple television series set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Robert Knepper. ** The character made his debut in Arrow.Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on Arrow, HIMYM, Once, Good Wife, Hannibal, Scandal, Sleepy and More In the second season episode \\"Time of Death\\", the Clock King masterminds the theft of a hacking device that could be used to break into bank vaults and computer systems.

Felicity then defeats him by hacking into his cell phone and making it explode. ** The Clock King returns in The Flash. In the episode \\"Power Outage\\", William Tockman is being escorted through the Central City police station, having been transferred for unspecified reasons. He subsequently takes advantage of a citywide blackout triggered by new villain Blackout- during which he also temporarily negates the Flash's powers- to take those in the police station hostage, including Joe West and his daughter Iris, but Iris manages to turn the tables on him when she is able to grab Eddie's gun from a hidden ankle holster before being taken as a hostage. She is shown shooting Tockman, who is wounded and once again arrested before Barry regains his powers and arrives to help. Animation * In The Batman, an antagonist turned hero named Francis Gray voiced by Dave Foley is very similar to the Clock King. Gray is a failed clockmaker and thief who develops his powers of time in prison. * The William Tockman version of Clock King appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Rise of the Blue Beetle!\\" voiced by Dee Bradley Baker with a German accent. Like his original version in the comics, he possesses many clock-themed weapons and gadgets, and wears a modified version of his original costume. He is shown to resemble the Walter Slezak version of the character underneath his mask. To keep with the clock theme, he has two henchmen named Tick and Tock. The Clock King is defeated by Batman and Green Arrow after they escape his trap. He later appears in \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\", trying to escape from Iron Heights Penitentiary, but was thwarted by Batman and Green Arrow.

In \\"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\\", Aquaman helps Green Arrow fight the Clock King. When they pursue him to a nearby store and Clock King threatens a woman, Aquaman contacts the lobsters in a nearby tank and has them attack Clock King. =DC Animated Universe= Temple Fugate/The Clock King as seen in Batman: The Animated Series. * A new incarnation of The Clock King appeared in multiple series throughout the DCAU, voiced by Alan Rachins. ** In Batman: The Animated Series, the Clock King is recreated as Temple Fugate (the name being a play on the Latin phrase tempus fugit, meaning \\"time flies\\") who first appears in the episode \\"The Clock King\\" and later returns in the episode \\"Time Out of Joint\\" voiced by Alan Rachins. In both appearances, the Clock King commonly dresses in a three-piece suit and bowler hat, with a pocket watch and glasses resembling clock faces. In his debut episode \\"The Clock King,\\" Temple Fugate is a head of a time and motion study consulting company that has been fined $20 million (for an unspecified reason) in court, but is now appealing against it. Fugate is obsessed with time and punctuality; his every waking moment is pre-planned on a \\"to do\\" list broken down into precise blocks. Future Gotham mayor Hamilton Hill convinces Fugate to break his schedule and take his coffee break at a slightly later time. However, due to a string of terrible luck, Fugate shows up late for his court appointment, loses his appeal and goes bankrupt as a result. Fugate later learns that Hill's firm represented the plaintiff for the case Fugate was late for, and swears revenge on Hill for making him late, even though Hill personally had nothing to do with the case. Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King and dedicates his life to destroying Hill. After publicly shaming Hill, Fugate has a confrontation with Batman inside a clock tower, and falls to his apparent death when the mechanisms are damaged. He returns in \\"Time Out of Joint\\", once again vowing revenge on Hill. For this time, Fugate is aided by a device that allows him to manipulate time in the blink of an eye, stolen from a secluded scientist, which he uses to plant a bomb outside a courthouse that Hill is to inaugurate. His plan is foiled by Batman and Robin, who catch Fugate and send him to Arkham Asylum. ** Alan Rachins reprised his role as The Clock King (Fugate) in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Task Force X\\". He has been recruited by Project Cadmus as part of the Suicide Squad to coordinate the mission and its timing is largely down to the second, except for a few minutes Fugate allotted for contingencies in the field. The timing for the plan was so important that the members are ordered to go on without a teammate if they are even one second late. =Film= * The 1960s TV series version of Clock King appears in Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders. He along with the other supervillains team up with Robin and Catwoman in order to stop a group of cloned rogue Batmen. * The William Tockman version of Clock King appears in The Lego Batman Movie. =Video games= * The William Tockman version of Clock King is a boss in Batman: The Brave and the Bold ‚Äì The Videogame, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.

He is a son of Teodoro Obiang, the President of Equatorial Guinea, by his first wife, Constancia Mangue. He served for years as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in his father's government before being appointed as Second Vice-President, in charge of defense and security, in May 2012. He was promoted to the position of First Vice-President in June, 2016. Education Nguema studied at l'Ecole des Roches of Normandy, a French private school. He attended Pepperdine University in Malibu California, United States for a four-term non-degree program in English as a second language. He lived lavishly at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and rarely attended class; he dropped out after only five months, reportedly at the behest of university administrators. Political career and possible succession Nguema served as Adviser to the Presidency in the 1990s and subsequently as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, a post he held for about 15 years.\\"Guin√©e √©quatoriale : le pr√©sident Obiang promeut son fils Teodor√¨n premier vice-pr√©sident\\", Jeune Afrique, 23 June 2016 . It was reported in 2005 that Nguema was to be made vice president of Equatorial Guinea, which, according to the constitution, would allow him to accede to the presidency upon his father's retirement. He was eventually elevated to the post of Second Vice-President, in charge of defense and security, on 21 May 2012, alongside former Prime Minister Ignacio Milam Tang, who was designated as First Vice-President. After four years as Second Vice-President, he was promoted to the post of First Vice-President, while remaining in charge of defense and security, on 22 June 2016; this move, which followed his father's re-election in the April 2016 presidential election, placed him clearly in line to succeed his father. Spending and controversies Presidential palace of Nguema's father Teodoro Obiang in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea As Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Nguema was paid ‚Ç¨3,200 (¬£2,700) a month. The New York Times reported in 2004 that Nguema was \\"a rap music entrepreneur and bon vivant, fond of Lamborghinis and long trips to Hollywood and Rio de Janeiro\\". Superyacht Tatoosh was hired for ¬£400,000 by him for a Christmas cruise when he entertained rap singer Eve. Nguema drew criticism from the international media for spending close to R10,000,000 over a weekend in South Africa on champagne, property renovations, a black 2004 Bentley Arnage, a cream 2005 Bentley Continental R from MG Rover Cape Town and a 2005 Lamborghini Murcielago, although some assets may soon be forcibly auctioned due to his failure to pay a South African businessman. American law enforcement officials believe that most or perhaps all of his wealth comes from corruption connected to oil and gas reserves in Equatorial Guinea.Ian Urbina, \\"Taint of Corruption Is No Barrier to U.S. Visa for Millionaire\\", The New York Times, 17 November 2009. Nguema's foreign interests include two houses in South Africa, worth a combined R50,000,000, a $31,000,000 compound in Malibu, California, a home on Avenue Foch in the affluent 16th arrondissement of Paris, and the hip hop music record label TNO Entertainment. In 2008 he owned one of the 30 models of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 sports car (estimated at 1,100,000 ‚Ç¨) and a Maserati MC 12 at 700,000 ‚Ç¨.David Servenay, Transparency porte plainte pour saisir la Ferrari d'Omar Bongo, Rue 89, 15 July 2008 He went on to purchase another Bugatti Veyron, and tried to purchase a third. In late 2011, both Veyrons, as well as nine other cars he owned, were seized by French police investigating corruption. In July 2013, the confiscated goods were sold at auction. The super yacht \\"Ebony Shine\\" (ex Ocean Victory) bought by Nguema On 19 January 2013, Nguema's father Teodoro Obiang arrested Roberto Berardi, an Italian building contractor, active for 20 years in Africa. After working in Cameroon, Berardi had formed a construction company with him, but discovered some strange operations on the current account and asked for an explanation. A few hours later, the Italian contractor was arrested on charges of fraud and embezzlement. Berardi was fined 1.2 million euros and jailed. No charges were brought from Italy against Obiang. Berardi was released on 14 July 2015 after more than two years of detention, including 18 months in solitary confinement. The super yacht \\"Ice\\" also bought by Nguema In 2014, the super yacht Ebony Shine, purchased for $100 million by the Equatorial Guinea holding company Dara Limited for use by Nguema, was seized by Dutch authorities in November 2016.List of motor yachts by length In 2015, Nguema gained use of the $150 million (over ‚Ç¨130 million) in length super yacht Ice from Suleyman Kerimov. Its home port is Gibraltar but has been moored at Tangiers, Morocco, since November 2016. On 18 October 2016, Swiss prosecutors opened an investigation on Nguema after he landed eight times in Geneva. French authorities had asked them for judicial assistance.He eventually reached an accommodation with the Swiss, letting them sell his seized luxury cars, valued at 18.5m Swiss francs, and the payment of 1.3 million Swiss francs. On 27 September 2019, in an auction organised by British auctioneers Bonhams, 25 luxury cars were sold for 23.4m Swiss francs . On 14 September 2018, Nguema flew on an official plane to Brazil with other 9 passengers and had some of their 19 bags searched by the Brazilian border police in Viracopos-Campinas International Airport. They found approximately US$1.4 M in cash and 20 watches with estimated value of US$15 M. =Embezzlement charges= In October 2011, seven years after the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations exposed the Nguema's family secret accounts at Riggs Bank in Washington and five years after non-profit Global Witness discovered his mansion purchase in Malibu ‚Äî the US Justice Department went to court to seize $70 million (¬£44m) of his US assets, which include a Gulfstream jet, yachts, cars and Michael Jackson memorabilia. On 11 June 2012, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed an amended complaint against Nguema, after a judge requested more evidence of the alleged corruption. The revised complaint states that he spent $315 million on properties and luxury goods between 2004 and 2011. According to the foreign complaint, he, while Minister of Forestry, levied personal \\"taxes\\" against local and foreign timber companies for licenses to operate and export timber, such as a $28.80 tax for every log exported, to fund his lavish lifestyle. The foreign prosecutors state that his expenditures \\"were inconsistent with both his known salary of less than $100,000 per year, and the income he purportedly generated from his companies.\\" In October 2014, he reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice to pay the U.S. DoJ some of the funds held at accounts on his behalf, as well as his Malibu home, a Ferrari, and portions of his Michael Jackson collection, for a total estimated value of US$34 million. Upon the resolution of the settlement, he was able to keep his Gulfstream Jet, as well as some of the Michael Jackson memorabilia, including the crystal Michael Jackson glove, and other assets. $20 million of the proceeds was pledged, on DOJ's website, to go to a charitable institution for the benefit of the people of Equatorial Guinea. Another $10.3 million was pledged to be used for the benefit of the people of Equatorial Guinea \\"to the extent permitted by law.\\" Since both of these pledges, there have been no records of the funds sent to any of the citizens, nor any of the infrastructure of Equatorial Guinea. In February 2012, a Parisian mansion belonging to Nguema, worth around ‚Ç¨100 million, was raided by French police and they discovered luxury goods inside worth millions of euros. In July 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for him.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea institutes proceedings against France with regard to \\"the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of [its] Second Vice- President in charge of Defence and State Security, and the legal status of the building which houses [its] Embassy in France\\", , retrieved 11 December 2016 The mansion was seized by French authorities in August 2012. He was indicted by the French justice on several counts of corruption and money-laundering with an 'in absentia' trial beginning in 2017.Kyle, Laura. (3 January 2017). \\"Inside Story: Can France hold corrupt African leaders to account?\\". Al Jazeera website Retrieved May 25, 2017. In response, Equatorial Guinea filed a case against France in the International Court of Justice accusing France of breaching the diplomatic immunity of its representatives and premises. In the preliminary phase the court found that France must guarantee the protection of the premises presented as housing the diplomatic mission of Equatorial Guinea in France. In September 2016, the District Attorneys Roger Le Loire and Charlotte Bilger referred Nguema to the Criminal Court of Paris, and issued an arrest warrant through Interpol. This procedure was validated by the International Court of Justice in December 2016. The French trial concluded in October 2017 with Nguema receiving a suspended sentence of three years plus a suspended fine of ‚Ç¨30 million. His properties in France, as well as 17 luxury cars, were also seized, including the Parisian mansion.

It is part of Township High School District 211, which also includes James B. Conant High School, Hoffman Estates High School, Palatine High School, and Schaumburg High School. The school is known for its academic excellence, and its athletic, drama, visual arts, and music programs have won state championships in recent years. Academically, Fremd High School has also been recognized by Newsweek as one of \\"America's Best High Schools\\" and by U.S. News & World Report as one of 99 outstanding high schools in the United States with the average AP test taker in the class of 2018 taking 5.4 exams. Fremd serves the portion of Palatine that is southwest of the UP NW Line railroad tracks as well as north Hoffman Estates, west Rolling Meadows, north Schaumburg, east South Barrington and southeast Inverness. Feeder schools include Plum Grove Junior High, Carl Sandburg Junior High, Walter Sundling Junior High and Margaret Mead Junior High. Feeder elementary schools are Pleasant Hill, Paddock, Hunting Ridge, Central Road, Willow Bend, Thomas Jefferson, Marion Jordan, Fairview, and Frank C. Whiteley. History Fremd opened in 1963 as Palatine High School South. The school was later named after William Fremd who had been a member of the high school board of education for over 30 years and had served on school boards in the area for a consecutive period of more than 45 years. Fremd donated the land for the school. In the first yearbook the school was said to 'blend and stretch into the cornfields'. The school was the second high school to be built in Palatine, Illinois after Palatine High School. Palatine South and then Fremd originally served as the school for all Palatine freshman and sophomores while Palatine High School was the school for juniors and seniors. This plan was only in effect for three years before Fremd was expanded to serve as a 4 year high school. In the fall of 1966 the first junior class entered, and they became the first Fremd graduating class in 1968. Then Junior Cathy Klep designed the Viking logo, based on the Minnesota Vikings logo. Junior, Colleen McGrath designed the school crest, incorporating the Viking logo and modeled after her family crest. A school motto was adopted in 1995 after a contest for students. Sophomore Jessica Frank won the contest. In 2001, construction began to create a new science wing. The courtyard which stood in the center of the school was demolished. After two years of year- round construction, the new science wing was built along with a heating and ventilation facility on the roof of the building. In the early 2000s, Fremd underwent several construction projects, including the replacement of bleachers in the main gymnasium, renovated tiling, and additional classrooms. The music department added a rehearsal room, larger practice rooms with more advanced sound-proof walls, and increased storage space. In the newest addition to the school, a synthetic turf football field was added. In 2016, a new pool facility was added to Fremd. On November 2, 2015, the New York Times reported that the federal government determined that Fremd's administration violated anti-discrimination laws because \\"it did not allow a transgender student who identifies as a girl and participates on a girls‚Äô sports team to change and shower in the girls‚Äô locker room without restrictions.\\" The New York Times added that the student in question \\"identifies as female but was born male.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/us/illinois-district-violated- transgender-students-rights-us-says.html As of 2018, Fremd is one of the largest high schools in the region, with a student body of approximately 2600. The school is also noted for its high operating costs: in the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, Fremd's district spent $18,721 per pupil, with the average teacher being paid $99,474. Academics In 2018, Fremd had an average SAT score of 1178.5 and a four-year graduation rate of 97.9%. The average class size is 24.7. On the mathematics portion of the SAT, 71.3% of students met or exceeded standards, while on the English/language arts portion, that figure was 68.5%. Additionally, 66.5% of students showed proficiency on the Illinois Science Assessment. From April 1998 to September 2019, 75 students from Fremd earned the highest possible composite score on the ACT, a 36. In the same time frame, only six students earned the highest possible score on the SAT, a 1600. In 1987, Fremd was named among the top in the nation in the United States Department of Education's National Secondary School Recognition Program. Fremd High School has also been recognized by Newsweek as one of \\"America's Best High Schools\\" and by U.S. News & World Report as one of 99 outstanding high schools in the United States.

Comic Buyer's Guide July 5, 1990. (pp. 58, 60, 62, 65-66). Through all the versions of Buck Rogers, Wilma Deering has maintained some clear characteristics. She is a sometimes-romantic interest for Buck, always a loyal defender of Earth, and an attractive and smart woman. She is generally depicted as brave with a penchant for getting herself into trouble. As with other science fiction heroines from the pulp science fiction genre and others, she has sometimes been depicted as a damsel in distress but more often as an assertive adventurer. In this way, her character resembles that of Dale Arden of the Flash Gordon comic books and movie serials, and also the character of Lois Lane from Superman. Pulp origins Wilma Deering appears in the very first Buck Rogers story, the novella Armageddon 2419 A.D., and the basic elements are present. She is depicted as adventurous, heroic and beautiful, and a romantic interest for the hero. Comic strip Wilma features in the Buck Rogers comic strip from its inception, as she the first person of Earth to meet Buck when he awakens in the 25th century. Depicted from the start as a love interest, Wilma is initially almost a stock character heroine just as Dr. Huer is a stock \\"brainy scientist\\". Her character does develop over time, however, into the more familiar spunky adventurer. 1939 serial The character of Wilma Deering was featured in the 1939 Buck Rogers movie serial which starred Buster Crabbe. The role of Wilma was portrayed by Constance Moore, in what would come to be her first highly recognized film role. In the serial, Buck Rogers and Buddy Wade awaken in the 25th century to find out that the world has been taken over by the outlaw army of Killer Kane. Along with Wilma Deering, who is a lieutenant in this incarnation, Buck and Buddy join in the fight to overthrow Kane with the help of Prince Tallen of Saturn and his forces. In this serial, Wilma is essentially the faithful sidekick, and her relationship with Dr. Huer is akin to that of a daughter. 1979 movie and series Colonel Wilma Deering was portrayed by actress/model Erin Gray in the 1979 movie and subsequent NBC television series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Initially, Wilma was depicted as a cold, aloof military officer and starfighter pilot, with little interest in Captain Rogers. However, she quickly warmed to him and, throughout the weekly series, Wilma Deering's character became warmer, sexier, and more humorous. Often, it was Wilma who came to the rescue of Buck, as opposed to the other way round. Erin Gray has commented that her role as Colonel Deering was an inspiration for many women who watched the program, particularly with regard to careers in the military. She also commented that she was aware of the highly sexualised one-piece uniform she wore and its effect on the show's male audience. She was once described by Clive James as Wonder Woman with brains. Revisions to the program in its second season changed Wilma from the central role of a colonel directing Earth's space defense, to more of a co-pilot role on the spaceship Searcher. This change was never entirely explained, but along with Buck and Twiki, hers was the only character viewed central enough to migrate to the revamped show. After the release of the film in 1979, Erin Gray initially opted not to reprise the role for the weekly television series and actress Juanin Clay was cast in the part. However, Gray then decided she would continue with the role. Clay appeared in an episode of the series as Major Marla Landers, a Wilma Deering-type character, in the 1979 episode \\"Vegas In Space\\". Buck Rogers XXV roleplaying game The character of Wilma Deering in the Buck Rogers roleplaying game is a more dystopic figure, in keeping with the themes of the game. In the role playing game Wilma is a native of the Chicagorg Arcology on Earth, and is described as an 8th level Terran warrior and a freedom fighter. Both her parents were killed by RAM, the evil organization that runs the corrupt Earth government in the game. Her biography indicates she was imprisoned for attacking RAM installations, and escaped later becoming a privateer. After several months, Wilma returned to Earth to officially join NEO, the rebel organization, and resumed her effort to free her home world from RAM. This version of Wilma is a tall woman with strawberry blonde hair and an explosive temper, and once again is both a foil and love interest for Buck Rogers. Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future Another incarnation of Wilma Deering appears in the 1995 novel Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future by Martin Caidin. This version of Deering is said to be a top pilot in the Space Corps, and continues the tradition of falling in love with the time-displaced test pilot, Buck Rogers.

July 1828 ‚Äì after c. 1873) was an Irish-Canadian maid who was involved in the 1843 murder of her Richmond Hill, Ontario, employer Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Her conviction for the murder of Kinnear was controversial and sparked much debate about whether Marks was actually instrumental in the murder or merely an unwitting accessory. Early life Marks was born and raised in Ulster in Ireland and had eleven siblings, three of whom were stillborn. The Marks' father, John, was a stonemason and an abusive alcoholic. The family immigrated to Canada in 1840 when Grace was twelve. Her mother died on the ship en route to Canada and was buried at sea. Kinnear murder Marks was employed as a maid in the house of Yonge Street farmer Thomas Kinnear, who was in a sexual relationship with his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. On July 18, 1843, Kinnear and Montgomery were murdered by a servant. Kinnear was shot and Montgomery, who was pregnant at the time of her death, was hit on the head with an axe and subsequently strangled before being dismembered and hidden under a large tub. Under the alias \\"Mary Whitney\\", Marks and the servant, James McDermott, fled together to the U.S., but were apprehended in Lewiston, New York and deported to Toronto. It remains unclear whether Marks had actually taken part in the double murder. Marks was tried with McDermott for the murder of Kinnear. A trial for Montgomery's murder was to follow, but was deemed unnecessary as both defendants were convicted of Kinnear's murder and sentenced to death. McDermott was hanged, but Marks's sentence was commuted to life in prison which she served in Kingston Penitentiary. At one period (May 4, 1852 ‚Äì August 18, 1853) she was committed to an asylum but was later returned to Kingston Penitentiary. In 1872, after almost thirty years of incarceration, Marks was pardoned and moved to northern New York. After that she disappeared. Popular portrayal What is known of Marks on the historical record comes primarily from Susanna Moodie's book Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush. She is the subject of Margaret Atwood's historical fiction novel Alias Grace and played by Sarah Gadon in the 2017 television adaptation directed by Mary Harron. Alias Grace was adapted for the stage by Jennifer Blackmer and premiered at the Rivendell Theater in Chicago on September 1, 2017.

In the game, controlling a simulated AH-64 Apache helicopter, players navigate through missions to attack enemy targets and protect friendly forces. Commercially and critically successful, Gunship was followed by Gunship 2000 and Gunship!. Gameplay Preparing to take off. The game features missions in seven regions, including the U.S. (training), Southeast Asia (1st Air Cavalry Division), Central America (82nd Airborne Division), Middle East (101st Airborne Division) and Western Europe (3rd Armored Division). After selection of region, style, and enemies, the pilot is assigned a primary mission and a secondary mission. These could include such objectives as \\"Destroy enemy headquarters\\" or \\"Support friendly troops\\" (i.e. destroy targets near friendly forces). The latter would be an easier mission, because the battle would be fought closer to friendly lines. The pilot then arms the Apache helicopter gunship, usually selecting AGM-114 Hellfire air-to- ground missiles (guided missiles that destroy \\"hard\\" targets such as bunkers and tanks), FFARs (Folding Fin Aerial Rockets; unguided rockets that destroy \\"soft\\" targets such as infantry and installations), and HEDP (High-Explosive, Dual-Purpose) rounds for the 30 mm cannon (an all-purpose weapon with a maximum range of 1.5 km); in Central America, the Middle East, and Western Europe, AIM-9 Sidewinders would also be standard equipment, usually as a backup air-to-air weapon in case of cannon failure. Patient players might move in short jumps, crouching behind hills to block the enemy's line of sight and suddenly popping up to attack. More aggressive players generally fly fast and erratically to evade enemy fire, flying in low to deliver devastating cannon attacks at close range. Since flight time is a component of the mission evaluation, either method has its advantages. The latter, however, can be rather dangerous against 1st Line enemies whose fast reaction times can cause the chopper to be pummelled with relentless fire. Most enemy fire, especially small caliber, is deflected by armor, but some will cause systems damage. After enough damaging hits, the structural integrity will fail, causing a general power failure. This manifests itself in a dual-engine flameout, warranting an emergency landing. An emergency landing by a seriously injured pilot in enemy territory causes him to become Missing in Action. If the pilot lands without serious injury, he can escape back to base and live to fight another day. There is no defined time limit in the game. A player can return to any number of Forward Area Resupply Points to be rearmed, refueled and damage repaired. Returning to the Home Base will end the mission. Ideally, the pilot completes both missions, knocks out other targets, and makes it back to base within 20 minutes. There is no ending to Gunship. Promotions stop once a pilot makes Colonel, although he can continue amassing medals, such as the Purple Heart, Air Medal, Bronze Star, Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor and retire with a final promotion to Brig. General. No medals in this game are prerequisites for earning others (the requirement of shooting down two Hinds in one mission for the Medal of Honor led some to believe that it was not possible to earn it before earning lower medals). Repeated medals are harder to earn than the first one. The criteria for winning medals is based on types of targets destroyed, number of targets destroyed, objectives met, time elapsed, and sometimes whether or not the pilot is wounded. As in real life, medals in this game can be awarded posthumously. Development and release MicroProse intended Gunship to simulate an urban helicopter akin to Blue Thunder, but found that city graphics were too difficult. It instead used tools developed for F-15 Strike Eagle to create another military simulation. The game was released in 1986 for the PC DOS, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, FM Towns, MSX, PC-98, Sharp X68000, and ZX Spectrum. Gunship was also ported to the Sega Genesis by U.S. Gold in 1993. However, this version of the game differed from the others by featuring more arcade-style gameplay and horizontal shoot 'em up stages. Reception Gunship was MicroProse's third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Its sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989. Info magazine gave Gunship for the Commodore 64 five stars out of five, describing it as \\"without qualification, the best combat flight simulator ever released for an 8-bit computer!\\" Praising its graphics, weapons, sound, controls, physics, and documentation, the magazine concluded that it was \\"PRIME!\\" Computer Gaming World stated \\"this reviewer heartily recommends Gunship ... A five-star rating (my highest) is well-deserved.\\" In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title three stars out of five, stating that \\"When initially released, this was THE helicopter simulation\\". Gunship received the Origins Award for \\"Best Screen Graphics in a Home Computer Game of 1986\\". It won the award for best simulation game of the year according to the readers of Crash. In 1987, Computer Gaming World named Gunship as its action game of the year, in 1988 the game joined the magazine's Hall of Fame for games highly rated over time by readers, and in 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 102nd best game of all time. Legacy A follow-up game, Gunship 2000, was released by MicroProse for several platforms between 1991 and 1996. Its successor, Gunship!, followed in 2000 for Microsoft Windows only.

He was supported by Yugoslavian leader Josep Broz Tito during efforts to bring Albania into the Yugoslavian federation. After Albania's leader, Enver Hoxha, established the country's independence with the support of the Soviet Union, Xoxe was arrested, tortured and executed. Life Xoxe was born in 1911 in Negovan, near Florina in Greece, back then part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Negovan (today Flampouro/Œ¶ŒªŒ¨ŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒø) had a majority of Orthodox Albanians, many of whom sided with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and a minority of Vlachs.Aarbakke, Vemund (2015). \\"The Influence of the Orthodox Church on the Christian Albanians‚Äô national orientation in the Period Before 1912\\". Albanohellenica. 6: 3. \\"In the period before the Balkan Wars the Christian Albanians in Florina, Bitola and Thessaloniki recognized the Greek church authorities and attended Greek schools.\\"; pp. 4-5. \\"K«închov has the following to say about their situation: In Ano and Kato Kotori they were Christian Albanians mixed with Bulgarians and liable to be assimilated to the latter. In Bel Kamen and Negovan they were Christian Albanians and some Vlachs. These two villages had relocated from the Konitsa kaza in Ipirus. They came to Bel Kamen around 1840 and to Negovan around 1860‚Ä¶ The village Negovan, on the other hand, withstood Bulgarian pressures to participate in preparations for the Ilinden uprising in 1903. Greek diplomats felt the village was relatively safe from the Bulgarians, but had greater apprehension of the Romanian propaganda (ŒîœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒºŒ∑œÇ 2000, 78, 180, 372). The villages Belkamen, Negovan and Lehovo became heavily involved on the Greek side in the Macedonian Struggle.\\"; p. 5. \\"In the wake of the Young Turk revolution a new self-assertion could be traced among the Christian Albanians and the Greek clergy struggled to contain the nationalist Albanians in Kor√ß√´ and Bitola (Bridge 1976, 401-2). This condition also extended into the kaza of Florina. Albanian and Vlach nationalists also challenged the Greek supremacy in the villages Bel Kamen, Negovan and Lehovo. In the village Negovan the Albanians were able to secure the use of the Patriarchist church by force (Bridge 1976, 418-9, 451-2).\\" According to some sources, Xoxe was an ethnic Macedonian or ethnic Bulgarian–ú–µ—Ç–µ, –°–µ—Ä–∂. ‚Äû–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –∞–ª–±–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ\\" (Serge M√©tais, \\"Histoire des Albanais\\"), –°., –†–∏–≤–∞, 2007, —Å—Ç—Ä. 286 from Aegean Macedonia and was initially a tinsmith. Around 1937 he emerged among others, such as Enver Hoxha and Ko√ßo Tashko, as prominent leaders of Albanian communism. In the post-World War II era, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito sought to exert his country‚Äôs influence over Albania through military support to Hoxha in an attempt to absorb Albania. Xoxe, who headed the Ministry of the Interior and the secret police, the Sigurimi, was supported by Tito. Josef Stalin reportedly told Milovan ƒêilas, a leading figure in Yugoslavia, that Yugoslavia should ‚Äúswallow up‚Äù Albania. Hoxha began to fear Xoxe as a rival to his own power. After Xoxe ordered the arrest of moderates with anti-Yugoslav sentiments, including Sejfulla Mal√´shova, Tito attacked Hoxha in a letter to the Albanian Politburo. Hoxha responded by traveling to Moscow with Nako Spiru and returned with a formal trade agreement with the Soviet Union without consulting Tito. Tito began to develop a more assertive policy towards the Soviets, which angered Stalin. Over time, Stalin began to side with Albania as a supportive bulwark against Tito. The Soviet Union began to increase Moscow‚Äôs presence in the country, spending specialists in mining and oil refining. Xoxe accused Spiru of subversion and, eventually, Spiru was found dead of a gunshot wound in his apartment under suspicious circumstances. Tito planned to send two army divisions into Albania under the pretense of protecting it from a Greek invasion, a move that angered Moscow. He then pushed Xoxe to convene a meeting of the Central Committee where he expelled Hoxha‚Äôs supporters and pushed a motion to combine Albania‚Äôs economy and military with Yugoslavia‚Äôs. Hoxha fought back with Soviet support and cancelled his agreements with Yugoslavia and expelled the country‚Äôs advisors. Xoxe attempted to save himself by declaring his support for the Soviet Union and arresting supporters of Tito in the government. The Central Committee, however, flipped on Xoxe, stripping him of his posts and expelling him from the party. In November 1948, he and many others were arrested. The Soviets wanted to paint Tito as the mastermind of anti-Marxist and anti-Albanian activities with the trials of Xoxe and the others. Xoxe was tortured in prison repeatedly until he confessed to conspiring with Tito against the Albanian government. In May 1949, he was placed on trial where he confessed to having been recruited by Ahmet Zogu, as well as British intelligence and that Tito was an agent of the west. Xoxe was sentenced to death and was hanged on June 11, 1949.Berend, Iv√°n T.

Wibberley went beyond the merely comic, using the premise to make commentaries about modern politics and world situations, including the nuclear arms race, nuclear weapons in general, and the politics of the United States. The novel originally appeared as a six-part serial in The Saturday Evening Post from December 25, 1954 through January 29, 1955, under the title The Day New York Was Invaded. It was published as a book in February 1955 by Little, Brown. The British editionLondon: Robert Hale, 1955 used the author's original intended title, The Wrath of Grapes, a play on John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Wibberley wrote one prequel (1958's Beware of the Mouse) and three sequels: The Mouse on the Moon (1962), The Mouse on Wall Street (1969), and The Mouse That Saved the West (1981). Each placed the tiny Duchy of Grand Fenwick in a series of absurd situations in which it faced superpowers and won. Plot The tiny (three miles by five miles) European Duchy of Grand Fenwick, supposedly located in the Alps between Switzerland and France, proudly retains a pre-industrial economy, dependent almost entirely on making Pinot Grand Fenwick wine. However, a California winery makes a knockoff version, \\"Pinot Grand Enwick\\", putting the country on the verge of bankruptcy. The prime minister decides that their only course of action is to declare war on the United States. Expecting a quick and total defeat (since their standing army is tiny and equipped with bows and arrows), the country confidently expects to rebuild itself through the largesse that the United States bestows on all its vanquished enemies (as it did for Germany through the Marshall Plan at the end of World War II). With the counterfeit wine as a casus belli, they send a formal written declaration of war, but this is misplaced by the State Department. Receiving no response, the Duchy is forced to muster some troops and hire a ship to stage an actual invasion. Landing in New York City, almost completely deserted above ground because of a citywide disaster drill, the Duchy's invading \\"army\\" (composed of the Field Marshal Tully Bascomb, three men-at-arms, and 20 longbowmen) wanders to a top secret government lab and unintentionally captures the \\"Quadium Bomb\\" (a prototype doomsday device that could destroy the world if triggered) and its maker, Dr. Kokintz, an absent- minded professor who is working through the drill. This \\"Q-Bomb\\" has a theoretical explosive potential greater than all the nuclear weapons of the United States and the Soviet Union combined. The invaders from Fenwick are sighted by a civil defence squad and are immediately taken to be \\"men from Mars\\" when their chain mail is mistaken for reptilian skin. The American Secretary of Defense pieces together what has happened (with help from the five lines in his encyclopedia on The Duchy of Grand Fenwick and the Fenwickian flag left behind on a flagpole) and is both ashamed and astonished that the United States was unaware that it had been at war for two months. With the most powerful bomb in the world now in the smallest country in the world, other countries are quick to react, with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom offering their support. With the world at the tiny country's mercy, Duchess Gloriana, the leader of Grand Fenwick, lists her terms: all the nuclear weapons of the powerful nations must go through an inspection by impartial scientists. Continued inspection of the continuing nuclear programs of the world powers will be supervised by Dr. Kokintz, who recalls his identity as a Fenwick-American and accepts repatriation to his ancestral home. Kokintz takes on his new role as scientific director of the \\"Tiny Twenty\\", a new superpower of 20 of the world's smallest nations headed by Grand Fenwick. The United States and the other world powers accept these humiliating terms, leading to hope for world peace. As a celebration of the triumphant outcome of the war, Duchess Gloriana and Tully Bascomb are united in marriage. As a sequel to the marriage, Dr. Kokintz accidentally drops the Q-Bomb onto the stone floor of the Grand Fenwick castle dungeon. As a result of this mishap, the scientific director inadvertently discovers that the Q-bomb is, and always has been, a powerless dud. The book concludes with Kokintz deciding to keep this key fact to himself. Background Wibberley got the idea from the US peace treaty negotiated with Japan by John Foster Dulles, which included generous amounts of aid to Japan. He wrote an article for the Times which suggested that his native Ireland make a token invasion of the US to get aid. He then developed this into a novel changing Ireland to the Duchy of Grand Fenwick. Reception Anthony Boucher praised the novel as \\"utterly delightful...a very nearly perfect book, on no account to be missed.\\"\\"Recommended Reading\\", F&SF;, June 1955, pp.75.  Adaptations  = Film adaptation = The Mouse That Roared was made into a 1959 film starring Peter Sellers in three roles: Duchess Gloriana XII; Count Rupert Mountjoy, the Prime Minister; and Tully Bascomb, the military leader - and Jean Seberg, as Helen Kokintz, as an added love interest. Other cast members included: William Hartnell as Sergeant-at-Arms Will Buckley; David Kossoff as Professor Alfred Kokintz; Leo McKern as Benter the opposition leader; MacDonald Parke as General Snippet; and Austin Willis as the United States Secretary of Defense. In 1963, a sequel, based on The Mouse on the Moon, was released. = Stage adaptation = The Mouse That Roared was adapted for the stage by Christopher Sergel in 1963. The play portrays Duchess Gloriana XII as twenty-two years old, as in Wibberley's novel. In this version, Dr. Kokintz is a physics professor at Columbia University and the arrival of Tully Bascomb's invasion force coincides with a campus student protest. Thus, the Fenwick soldiers are mistaken for being eccentric protesters rather than as foreign invaders. = Television pilot = In 1964, Jack Arnold produced a television pilot based on the film, with Sid Caesar playing the three roles that Sellers had played, but it was not picked up for production.Reemes, Dana M. Directed by Jack Arnold 1988 McFarland, p.140 = Radio adaptation= BBC Radio 4 broadcast a one-hour adaptation on 15 February 2003 and 22 May 2010 as part of its Saturday Play series. The production was directed by Patrick Rayner and starred Julie Austin as Gloriana, Mark McDonnell (who co-adapted the book for radio) as Tully, Crawford Logan as Count Montjoy, Simon Tait as Dr. Kokintz and Steven McNicoll (who also co-adapted the book) as Mr. Benter.

The protagonists of the Metal Hero Series are mainly space, military and police-based characters who are typically either androids, cyborgs, or human beings who don \\"metallic\\" armored suits. Henceforth, most of the Metal Heroes are also referenced as another example of the \\"Henshin (transforming) Heroes\\" genre. Usually, the genre revolves around a technological theme where technology, in the right hands, can be used for the greater good. The shows were produced by Toei from 1982 through 1999 in conjunction with their other Tokusatsu superhero shows, Kamen Rider and Super Sentai. In addition to Japan, they are also popular in France, Brazil, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. During the 1990s, Saban Entertainment used some of the shows to produce programs similar to their Power Rangers series. Some of the Metal Hero Series even spawned such sequels which followed the continuity of the previous shows, resulting in the genre developing sub- categories based mainly on space, military and police-related characters.

Both shows ran for two seasons. As of 2018, Discotek Media has licensed Juspion for release marking the first release of Metal Heroes in the US. Both Jiraiya and Gavan were used for the Power Rangers franchise with Jiraiya as Sheriff Skyfire in Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel and Gavan as Captain Chaku in Power Rangers Beast Morphers. = Philippines = In the Philippines (where several series aired and were dubbed into local languages) Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan was greenlighted by Toei as a sequel to Shaider, with characters who are descendants of those in the original series. Toei later halted production, instead authorizing a spin-off series set 20 years after the end of Shaider. = Brazil = The Metal Hero series were successful in Brazil. In 1988, Juspion (as Jaspion) was broadcast by TV Manchete. Manchete followed with Jiraiya in 1989, Jiban in 1990, Spielvan (renamed Jaspion 2) in 1991, Winspector in 1994 and Solbrain in 1995. Other networks also bought shows, with TV Bandeirantes broadcasting Metalder and Sharivan in 1990 and two networks (Rede Globo and TV Gazeta) airing Sheider and Gavan (renamed Gyaban) in 1991. Jaspion, Jiraiya and Jiban were later released on DVD in the country. Until 2016, most of the series that were released in Brazilian television in 80's and 90's are going to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Playplus in Brazil. The distribution company Sato Company acquired many of those series and negotiated with Netflix. Also, some new products like Garo series are in these negotiations too. Current status Other similar heroes, such as Nebula Mask Machine Man, Kyodai Ken Byclosser and Choukou Senshi Chang√©r√≠on, were also produced during the time that the Metal Hero Series were on the air, but are not included as part of the Metal Hero Series for various reasons. Machine Man and Bicrosser were created by Shotaro Ishinomori, while Chang√©r√≠on's armor is not metallic. Currently, the Metal Hero Series were one of Toei's defunct genres as the company rather favors more of the Super Sentai and Kamen Rider Series of shows and allegedly the passing of Shotaro Ishinomori. Although, many of the Metal Hero traits have been adopted into the new generation of Super Sentai and Kamen Rider shows. Today, the present versions of these type of heroes are also merged in with the Henshin Heroes description. Some Metal Heroes have also made cameo appearances. In 2004, a special Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger stage show had a special appearance by Gavan, who assisted Hurricane Red from Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger and Aba Red from Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger in battling various Alienizer monsters from Deka Ranger. In 2005, Toei released some Uchuu Keiji trilogy merchandise. Later that year, Bandai released a \\"Souchaku Henshin\\" figure of Gavan, followed by \\"Souchaku Henshin\\" figures of Sharivan and Shaider in early 2006. In May 2006, a PlayStation 2 video game titled The Space Sheriff Spirits was released. The game featured Gavan, Sharivan and Shaider all teaming up to battle past enemies from their series. The game was panned by critics, however, for bland graphics and dull gameplay. In early 2008, the trading card company Cardass announced a new, Metal Heroes based expansion to their Rangers Strike card game, entitled Special Metal Edition, featuring characters and vehicles from the various Metal Hero Series for use within the game. Despite no more television series having been made, the Space Sheriff Series re-emerged in the 2010s with feature films, including new actors portraying successors to Gavan, Sharivan, and Shaider. Some of them are stand alone entries, while others feature crossovers with other Super Sentai and Kamen Rider characters.

This demonstration was initiated and sustained by the non-Jewish wives and relatives of Jewish men and mischling who had been arrested and targeted for deportation, based on the racial policy of Nazi Germany. The protests continued until the men being held were released. The Rosenstrasse protest is considered to be a significant event as it is the only mass public demonstration by Germans in the Third Reich against the deportation of Jews. In describing the protests, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer states, \\"There were demonstrations, public protests against random arrests, - first dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of women, who demanded in unison \\"Give us back our men!\\" This lasted a whole week, in icy weather, in the middle of Berlin in 1943. Finally the protest by the women of the Rosenstrasse, furiously desperate and undeterred by any threats, made the Nazi regime retreat. 1700 Berlin Jews, whom the Gestapo in their so-called \\"final action\\" had herded together into the Jewish community house on Rosenstrasse near Alexanderplatz, were freed\\".  Context  \\"Whoever wears this sign is an enemy of our people\\" - thousands of Jews in non-privileged mixed marriages wore this star of David. It was the goal of the Nazi government to classify intermarried Jews similarly to those of the \\"full-Jew\\" status as defined by the Nuremberg Laws, and murder them accordingly. However, most of those deemed to be of the Aryan race who were married to Jews refused to divorce. The Nazi regime ultimately refrained from outright persecution of these individuals, possibly to avoid drawing attention to these examples of successful non-compliance. Ultimately, Nazi leadership might have feared jeopardizing the secrecy of the Final Solution (there were some 30,000 intermarried couples in Germany as of 1939). Under pressure from intense lobbying, the regime began to make exceptions for intermarried Jews. Nonetheless, they continued to exert strong pressure on Aryan partners (mostly women) to divorce their Jewish partners. The exceptionally brutal arrests of Berlin Jews, beginning on February 27, 1943 marked an escalation in efforts to remove these Jewish family members. According to Mordecai Paldiel, Holocaust survivor and former Director of the Department of the Righteous among the Nations program at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust authority, \\"The Rosenstrasse protest embraced hundreds of women at the site where most of the Jewish men were interned (in a building which previously served the Jewish community in Berlin), before being processed to the camps... who gathered every day, and facing armed SS soldiers, shouted: \\"Give us our husbands back!\\"  Chronology  On 18 February 1943, Goebbels proclaimed a policy of \\"Total War\\" in a speech in Berlin. He now argued that the threat of a second \\"stab-in-the-back\\" required the \\"internal security\\" situation of the Reich be improved.Gellatey Robert Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001 page 143. On January 22, Goebbels and Hitler agreed that it was time for the final push to expel the last Jews in Germany. At this meeting, Hitler and Goebbels agreed that there \\"could be no internal security\\" until the last Jews living in Vienna and Berlin could be deported \\"as quickly as possible\\". Just after the German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Gestapo had arrested the last of the Jews in Berlin during the Fabrikaktion. Around 1,800 Jewish men, almost all of them married to non-Jewish women (others being the so-called Geltungsjuden), were separated from the other 10,000 arrested, and housed temporarily at Rosenstra√üe 2‚Äì4, a welfare office for the Jewish community located in central Berlin. On the morning of Saturday February 27, 1943, the SS, Gestapo and the Berlin police began to arrest Jews all over Berlin. The 1,800 men were so-called \\"privileged Jews\\", a category exempt from deportation and other anti-Jewish measures by reason of being married to German spouses, or employment as officials of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, the Jewish organization officially recognised by the German government for the purpose of controlling the Jewish population. Despite the media blackout ordered by Goebbels, it was impossible for the state to arrest so many Jews in Berlin in one day without people noticing. All over Berlin on 27 February, trucks packed full of Jews were constantly going up and down the streets of Berlin. All throughout March 1, more and more trucks had arrived at Rosenstrasse 2‚Äì4 to pack Jewish people from around Berlin into the center. The people arriving at Rosenstrasse were mostly Jewish men married to Aryan women or Mischlinge. By this point, several of the hundreds of women gathered outside of Rosenstrasse 2-4 had announced they would not leave until their husbands had been released . A vehicle drove up with four men from the 1st Waffen-SS Division Adolf Hitler Leibstandarte to tell the women to go home, but they were ignored. The authorities were astonished by the protests as it had never occurred to them that this was possible, and the SS guards at the Rosenstrasse 2-4 felt it necessary to call upon the Berlin police to provide reinforcements as the crowds outside of Rosenstrasse 2-4 kept getting larger and larger. The protests were briefly stopped on the night of 1 March 1943 when the British Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed Berlin. It was a public holiday in honour of the Luftwaffe, which the RAF decided to mark with an especially big air raid on Berlin. Those held inside of the Rosenstrasse recalled the cowardice of the SS and Gestapo, who were the first to take to the cellars of the building to escape the bombing as soon as the air raid siren blew. Ursula Braun, a fianc√©e of one of the interred Jewish men, recalled mixed feelings about the bombing of Berlin: \\"On the one hand were fury and hate against the Nazis, who deserved the attack, and on the other side there was terrible misery all around each of us-the screaming people, the hellish fires\\". One Jewish woman, Charlotte Israel, stated: \\"I always had such fear about the air raids. But on that night I thought, that serves them right! I was so enraged. I was together with a few other, who got down on their knees and prayed. I could have laughed in scorn! But then I thought of my husband, who as locked up at Rosenstrasse. I knew they would not be able to leave the building\\". Sometimes, people passing by joined the protests. By 4 March 1943, the regime felt threatened enough by the protests at Rosenstrasse to lash out by executing the last members of the Communist Herbert Baum resistance group who had burned down a Nazi art exhibit in Berlin in May 1942 while arresting several prominent Jewish intellectuals, who were all sent to Auschwitz. The RSHA favored shooting all of the women protesting on Rosenstrasse, but this plan was vetoed by Goebbels, who argued that the protests were apolitical, an attempt by women to keep their families together rather an attempt to bring down the Nazi regime. In the aftermath of the Battle of Stalingrad, a defeat which had gravely shaken German morale and led to the first signs of defeatism among the German people, Goebbels had proclaimed a policy of Total War. Goebbels argued that there was no way the regime could massacre thousands of unarmed women in the middle of Berlin and keep the massacre secret, and the news of the massacre would further undermine German morale by showing that the German people were not all united in the Volksgemeinschaft for Total War. The American historian Nathan Stolzfus argued that the need to keep the appearance of the German people all united in the Volksgemeinschaft might explain why force was not used, but: > Nevertheless, had there been no protest on Rosenstrasse, the Gestapo would > have kept on arresting and deporting Jews until perhaps even Eichmann's most > radical plans had been fulfilled. Differences existed between Eichmann's > office and the leadership on the importance of maintaining social quiescence > during deportations, but this would not have mattered if the protests during > the Final Roundup had not arisen. Power plays surrounding decision-making on > intermarried Jews and mischlinge do not so much explain the survival of > these Jews as point to the regime's fear of unrest. There would have been no > hesitation and no conflict among officials had intermarried Germans > cooperated fully with Nazi racial aims ... It was the recalcitrance of > intermarried Germans that had made a real issue out of the different > positions of the top leadership and the RSHA on the importance of social > quiescence in the first place and it was their protest in 1943 that soon > caused Goebbels to revert to the position of temporarily deferring these > problem cases.Stolzfus, Nathan Resistance of the Heart, New York: W.W. > Norton, 1996 page 238. Despite periodic threats of being shot if the women did not disperse their protest, the women would scatter briefly, and then return to Rosenstrasse 2‚Äì4 to continue protesting. Holzer later stated in an interview: \\"We expected that our husbands would return home and that they wouldn't be sent to the camps. We acted from the heart, and look what happened. If you had to calculate whether you would do any good by protesting, you wouldn't have gone. But we acted from the heart. We wanted to show that we weren't willing to let them go. What one is capable of doing when there is danger can never be repeated. I'm not a fighter by nature. Only when I have to be. I did what was given me to do. When my husband need my protection, I protected him ... And there was always a flood of people there. It wasn't organized or instigated. Everyone was simply there. Exactly like me. That's what is so wonderful about it\\". On 6 March 1943, Goebbels in his capacity as the Gauleiter of Berlin ordered all of the people imprisoned at Rosenstrasse 2-4 released, writing \\"I will commission the security police not to continue the Jewish evacuations in a systematic manner during such a critical time [a reference to the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad]. We want to rather spare that for ourselves until after a few weeks; then we can carry it out that much more thoroughly\\". In reference to the protests, Goebbels attacked the RSHA, stating \\"One has to intervene all over the place, to ward off damages. The efforts of certain officers are so lacking in political savvy that one cannot let them operate on their own for ten minutes!\\". On 1 April 1943, the American Legation in Bern reported to Washington: \\"Action against Jewish wives and husbands on the part of the Gestapo ... had to be discontinued some time ago because of the protest which such action aroused\\".The first page of a list of 67 women from the Berlin Bureau of Reparations who attested to protesting at the Rosenstrasse demonstration. Leopold Gutterer, who was Goebbels's deputy at the Propaganda Ministry, remembered that Goebbels stated if force was used to crush the demonstrations, it would prompt wider protests all over Berlin, which might soon become political, and could possibly even lead to the overthrow of the Nazi regime. Gutterer stated in an interview: \\"Goebbels released the Jews in order to eliminate that protest from the world. That was the simplest solution: to eradicate completely the reason for the protest. Then it wouldn't make any sense to protest anymore. So that others didn't take a lesson [from the protest], so others didn't begin to do the same, the reason [for the protest] had to be eliminated. There was unrest, and it could have spread from neighborhood to neighborhood ... Why should Goebbels have had them [the protestors] all arrested? Then he would have only had even more unrest, from the relatives of these newly arrested persons\\". Gutterer also said: \\"That [protest] was only possible in a large city, where people lived together, whether Jewish or not. In Berlin were also representatives of the international press, who immediately grabbed hold of something like this, to loudly proclaim it. Thus news of the protest would travel from one person to the next\\". Goebbels swiftly realized that to use force against the women protesting on the Rosenstrasse would undermine the claim that all Germans were united in the volksgemeinschaft, which was especially threatening as belief in the volksgemeinschaft held the German home front together. Furthermore, using force against the protestors would not only damage the volksgemeinschaft, which provided the domestic unity to support the war, but would also draw unwanted attention to the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". Stolzfus wrote: \\"A public discussion about the fate of deported Jews threatened to disclose the Final Solution and thus endanger the entire war effort\\".Stolzfus, Nathan Resistance of the Heart, New York: W.W. Norton, 1996 page 245. Despite the news blackout imposed by Goebbels, the news of the protests on the Rosenstrasse had traveled swiftly by word of mouth all over Germany and beyond; in Switzerland, British and American diplomats heard rumors of the Rosenstrasse protests, and in the first week of March 1943, British and American newspapers reported on the protests in Berlin. Goebbels hit back by having the German newspapers claim that the women were actually protesting against the British bombing of Berlin, and far from cracking, the volksgemeinschaft was stronger than ever, stating that charity donations in Germany had gone up 70% in the last year [i.e. a sign that the volksgenossen or \\"National Comrades\\" all cared for each other]. Hitler himself expressed concerns that the protestors on the Rosenstrasse reminded him too much of those Germans who protested against World War I in 1918, which presaged the November Revolution. The National Socialist regime had based its claim to legitimacy to a very large extent on the claim the volksgemeinschaft had been created in 1933, and anything that suggested that the volksgemeinschaft was maintained only by force instead of free will thus threatened the regime's claim to legitimacy. On 9 March 1943, during a meeting, Hitler told Goebbels that he acted \\"correctly\\" as he understood the \\"psychological\\" reasons for the Rosenstrasse protests. Having praised Goebbels for \\"having done the right thing\\", Hitler added he still expected Goebbels to make certain the Jews of Berlin \\"disappeared\\", if just not right now. The Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, though he intensely disliked Goebbels, also approved of releasing the Jews held on the Rosenstrasse. Himmler, who liked to boast that he \\"felt the pulse of the German people\\", had advised in 1941 during the protests against the Aktion T4 mass murder program to cancel the program as it was creating too many protests, and now advised that it was better to give in since using force would only cause more protests. As the Jews were released from the Rosenstrasse 2‚Äì4, they were warned by the Gestapo that this was not the end, and to enjoy their moment of freedom while it lasted, because they would be coming for them again. Despite his promise to Hitler, Goebbels did not try to deport the men of the Rosenstrasse to Auschwitz again, saying the risk of protest was too great, and instead ordered the men of the Rosenstrasse to stop wearing their yellow stars of David on 18 April 1943. Without knowing it, the women who protested on the Rosenstrasse had also saved the lives of other Jews. On May 21, 1943, in response to a question from the chief of the Security Police in Paris, Rolf G√ºnther, who was Adolf Eichmann's deputy at the Jewish Desk of the RSHA, stated that French Jews married to Gentiles could not be deported until the question of German Jews in mixed marriages was \\"clarified\\". As half of the Jews living in mixed marriages in the Reich were living in Berlin, the question could not be \\"clarified\\" until Jews living in mixed marriages in Berlin were deported, which thus led G√ºnther to rule no deportations of French Jews in mixed marriages at present. On 21 May 1943, Ernst Kaltenbrunner of the RSHA issued a memo ordering the release of all German Jews in mixed marriages from concentration camps except those convicted of criminal offenses. The same memo listed four categories of Jews who until now had been spared deportation, including those considered \\"irreplaceable\\" by the arms industry; the memo ordered the first three categories deported, but spared the fourth, namely those in mixed marriages as it stated a repeat of the Rosenstrasse protests was not desirable. The men imprisoned in the Rosenstrasse survived the Holocaust. The protests on the Rosenstrasse were the only time that there was ever a protest against the \\"Final Solution\\" in Nazi Germany. Overall, the women succeeded in freeing their husbands. As stated by Konrad Kwiet, Holocaust Scholar, ‚ÄúThe strongest form of public protest found its expression in a late, spectacular demonstration. In February 1943, in the Rosenstrasse in Berlin, a group of German women succeeded in securing the release of their Jewish husbands who had been rounded up as forced laborers in the course of the Fabrik-Aktion\\" The women who protested at Rosenstrasse saw themselves not as a part of a larger picture, but acted as wives and mothers demanding to have their loved ones back; they did not see this as an inherently political movement, yet they projected a voice so powerful not even the Nazi party was able to resist giving in to their demands.  Significance  = Historian perspectives = There are important issues at stake in the \\"historians' controversy\\" about this protest. In 2003 German historian Kurt P√§tzold explained part of what is at issue: arguing that a protest rescued Jewish lives \\"strikes at the center of the historical perception of the character of the Nazi regime and the way it functioned, and weighs on judgments about the possibilities for resistance\\". Another German historian, Konrad Kwiet, added that \\"the successful outcome of this late protest suggests that if similar actions at an earlier stage had been carried out throughout Germany, they might have halted the increasingly destructive course of the German anti-Jewish policy\\". Also at stake is whether the Gestapo would always destroy opposition as soon as they knew about it. Did the regime set its course, issue orders, and carry them out in every detail, using brute force to have its way if necessary? Or was it tactically opportunistic, improvising its decisions within changing circumstances to maximise its impact? Ultimately, the question is whether the Jews released following the Rosenstrasse demonstration owe their lives to the protest, or whether as another German historian wrote, they have the Gestapo \\"to thank\\" for their survival. Recently, some German historians have set the protest within the contexts of left-wing resistance, Jewish underground survival, and Nazi policies of forced labour and deportation, and to argue that while the non-Jewish partners were targeted, harassed and intended for internment, actual deportation was not the aim in early 1943. Wolf Gruner has argued that at this time the Gestapo excluded Jews with Aryan partners from expulsion, and corrected Berlin officials who tried to remove them. German historian Diane Schulle summarizes this perspective in her essay \\"Forced Labour\\": \\"Gruner‚Ä¶suggests that regardless of the protests, the deportation of mixed-marriage partners had never been part of the plan. The arrests of Mischlinge [\\"half-Jews\\"] and Jews living in mixed marriages had been undertaken for a purpose other than deportation: registration\\".Schulle, \\"Forced Labor,\\" Jews in Nazi Berlin: From Kristallnacht to Liberation in Beate Meyer, Hermann Simon, Chana Sch√ºtz, eds. (University of Chicago Press, 2009, 166-6) Citing Goebbels' diary, Gruner does not dispute that in early 1943 Goebbels and Hitler were determined to conclude the \\"Jewish Question\\" in Germany and in Berlin \\"as fast as possible\\", and writes that Hitler ordered Nazi Party leaders \\"to be ruthless\\". However, Gruner says Nazi directives at that time prohibited the Gestapo from deporting German Jews married to non-Jews, and so in Gruner's view the protest had no impact on the Gestapo, since deportation was not their aim. As evidence, Gruner says that on February 20, 1943, Himmler's Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) ordered that intermarried Jews were to be exempted from the deportations \\"temporarily\\". Four days later, a Gestapo order from the city of Frankfurt an der Oder directed Gestapo agents to avoid drawing attention to intermarried Jews. They were instead encouraged to arrest these Jews on other charges including \\"impudence\\", prior to sending them to a concentration camp. According to this order, Gruner wrote that \\"much would depend on the arbitrary behavior of the officers at each location\\". = Terminology = This history is also significant because it shows the importance of terminology used in Nazi histories. Although the massive arrests of Berlin Jews beginning on February 27, 1943 is commonly known as the \\"Fabrikaktion\\", or \\"Factory Action\\", this term was never used by the Gestapo but was invented after the war. The Gestapo code names for this action were \\"Elimination of Jews from the German Reich\\" and \\"Final roundup of Jews in Berlin\\". Using the Gestapo terms in this case is important because Jews were not just arrested at their factory workplaces, but were also arrested at home, and persons seen on the streets wearing the Jewish star were chased down and carted off to be dispatched from Berlin. Goebbels resolved in February 1943 not to deport Jews working in factories, but to make Berlin Judenrein, \\"free of Jews\\", which meant he was intent on dispatching anyone wearing the Jewish Star. = Germany's relationship to the past = Germans have made exemplary strides in coming to terms with the Nazi past. Two articles in early 2018 in the German press which presented contrasting interpretations of the Rosenstrasse Protest on the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary suggest that some work remains. While the Berliner Tagesspiegel (February 27) credited that protest with rescuing two thousand Jews, Der Spiegel (March 2) represented institutions and persons who sharply disagree. In this position, \\"Aryan\\" (non-Jewish) partners who demonstrated for the release of their husbands are to be commended, although their protest made no difference whatsoever since their protest coincided perfectly with Gestapo plans: \\"A decree of the Reich Security Main Office, however, did not provide for the deportation of any Jews living in a so-called mixed marriage, but only the removal from the factories, in order to ‚Äòcapture‚Äô [erfassen] them, after which they were to be released back to their homes ... \\" The standard evidence for this position referred to by Der Spiegel‚Äôs editors is the decree of the Frankfurt/Oder Gestapo circulated by the Administrator for the District of Calau dated February 25, 1943, as interpreted by Gruner. In 1995, Gruner wrote that \\"views that such demonstrations could have hampered the RSHA's deportation plans are unlikely to hold up in the historic context,\\" and he subsequently cautioned that an interpretation that saw the Gestapo swayed by street protests posed \\"A danger of dramatically underestimating the governance of the Nazi regime\\". Indeed, interpretations about what happened during the Rosenstrasse events do go to the heart of our understanding of the way the Nazi dictatorship ruled the Volk. Did it get everything it wanted from them with force, when met with noncompliance or protest? The Frankfurt/Oder Erlass does not suggest that the Gestapo did not plan to deport any of the intermarried Jews it arrested during the course of its Reich-wide \\"Removal of Jews from Reich Territory Actions\\", which began on February 27, 1943. It says in part: \\"All Jews still employed are to be removed from businesses for the purpose of the collection [Erfassung]. Uppity behavior of Jews in a still-existing mixed marriage, is to be punished by placing them in protective custody with a request for their placement in a concentration camp. This [punishment] can be carried out very unsparingly, but the impression must be avoided that this action is fundamentally resolving the mixed marriage problem at this same time. Unless there are reasons to justify the imprisonment of the Jews who live in mixed marriages, these Jews are to be sent to their homes\\". This local order could have had no bearing on the fate of Jews imprisoned on Berlin's Rosenstrasse; certainly it did not stand between Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter of Berlin, and his resolve to declare his city free of Jews by March. (Diary, February 2, 1943). Its local character is clear, for example in its references to specific work-camps in the region. It does invoke the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) to lay out the purpose of the action as detaining all Jews \\"for the purpose of collection\\". Erfassung might mean either \\"collection\\" or \\"registration\\", but critically for its interpretation here, in the Erlass it applies to all Jews arrested‚Äîincluding those sent to Auschwitz‚Äîand not just to Jews in intermarriage.  Commemmoration rose-colored Litfa√ü column commemorates the event. Rosenstrasse protest memorial The building on Rosenstra√üe, near Alexanderplatz, in which the men were held, was destroyed during an Allied bombing of Berlin at the end of the war. The original Rosenstra√üe location is now marked by a rose-colored Litfa√ü column 2‚Äì3 meters high, dedicated to the demonstration. Information about this event is posted on the Litfa√ü column. In the mid-1980s, Ingeborg Hunzinger, an East German sculptor, created a memorial to those women who took part in the Rosenstra√üe Protest. The memorial, named \\"Block der Frauen\\" (Block of Women), was erected in 1995 in a park not far from the site of the protest. The sculpture shows protesting and mourning women, and an inscription on the back reads: \\"The strength of civil disobedience, the vigour of love overcomes the violence of dictatorship; Give us our men back; Women were standing here, defeating death; Jewish men were free\\". The Israeli historian Omer Bartov observed that the memorial does not actually explain what the Rosenstrasse protests were or achieved, as if many Germans would prefer to forget about the protests, presumably because the protesters achieved their demands.Bartov, Omer \\"Defining Enemies, Making Victims: Germans, Jews, and the Holocaust\\" pages 771-816 from The American Historical Review, Volume 103, Issue # 3, Jun 1998 page 797. The events of the Rosenstra√üe protests were made into a film in 2003 by Margarethe von Trotta under the title Rosenstra√üe. The 75th anniversary of the protest occurred in 2018. The German consulate in New York, United States commemorated the anniversary on February 24, 2018. German politician Petra Pau, a member of Germany's Die Linke party, gave a speech in the Bundestag marking the anniversary. In an article titled \\"Rosenstrasse at 75\\" in the Jerusalem Post, the events of the protest are highlighted and compared to the grievances expressed during the 2017‚Äì2018 Iranian protests.

He was a member of Hellyeah for 12 years from 2006 until his death in 2018. He also co-founded the heavy metal band Damageplan in 2003 with his younger brother, Dimebag Darrell. Early years Vincent Paul Abbott was born in Abilene, Texas, on March 11, 1964. His parents were Jerry, a country music songwriter and producer, and Carolyn Abbott. Vincent originally played the tuba but was directed towards the drums by his father, who said there were no career prospects for a tuba player. His father bought him his first drum kit. Abbott cited Peter Criss and Tommy Aldridge as his biggest influences as a drummer. Career =Pantera= Abbott formed the heavy metal band Pantera in 1981 with his brother Darrell Abbott and Terry Glaze on guitars, bassist Tommy D. Bradford, and vocalist Donnie Hart. Upon Hart's departure, Terry Glaze assumed vocal duties. In the summer of 1982, Bradford left the band and was succeeded by Rex Brown. The band released three albums with that lineup. Pantera recruited vocalist Phil Anselmo in 1987. By 1990, the band had been signed to Atco Records and released Cowboys from Hell, which proved to be the band's turning point. Over the course of four more studio records, a live album and a greatest hits compilation, Anselmo and Pantera were nominated for four best metal performance Grammys for the songs \\"I'm Broken\\", \\"Suicide Note Pt. I\\", \\"Cemetery Gates\\", and \\"Revolution Is My Name\\". In 2001, Anselmo decided to put Pantera on hold because of back pain while he toured and recorded with his side projects. Pantera's official disbandment took place in 2003 for several reasons, but mainly because of the ongoing dispute between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers, although Rex Brown remained neutral. In the years to follow, animosity would stir up between Abbott and Anselmo. Anselmo had publicly announced that he wished for Paul to forgive him and reform a friendship. However, Paul stated that he was not interested in speaking to Anselmo. =Damageplan= After the breakup of Pantera, the Abbott brothers formed the heavy metal band Damageplan with former tattoo artist Bob Zilla on bass and former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on lead vocals. Damageplan recorded one album, New Found Power, which was released on February 10, 2004. The song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", a collaboration with Alice in Chains guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, was not completed in time to be featured on the album, but it was featured on the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Punisher, and was a bonus track on the Japanese version of New Found Power. On December 8, 2004, while on tour to support Damageplan's album, Darrell was shot and killed along with three others by Nathan Gale at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. Damageplan disbanded shortly thereafter. In a 2016 interview with Loudwire, Vinnie Paul revealed that there are five unreleased Damageplan tracks that were meant for the band's second album that was set to be released in 2005, but that those tracks have no vocals, only him and Dimebag playing on them. Paul said that he didn't know what to do with those tracks, but he often thought about having some of Dimebag's favorite singers like Rob Halford of Judas Priest and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to record vocals for the songs, but he didn't have time to do it because he was focused on his band Hellyeah. =Hellyeah= Abbott performing with Hellyeah After the death of his brother, Abbott formed Big Vin Records in February 2006 and released Rebel Meets Rebel and a DVD, Dimevision, Volume 1. Abbott, along with Cristina Scabbia (co-lead vocalist of Lacuna Coil), wrote a monthly question-and-answer column in Revolver. Abbott maintained endorsement deals with ddrum, Sabian cymbals, and Vic Firth drumsticks. He previously endorsed Tama, Pearl drums, and Remo drumheads and hardware. In June 2006, after an 18-month hiatus, Abbott was not sure if he would return to music, but eventually joined the heavy metal supergroup Hellyeah, which featured vocalist Chad Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett from Mudvayne, guitarist Tom Maxwell from Nothingface, and bassist Bob Zilla from Damageplan, who was a replacement for original bassist Jerry Montano. Abbott recorded six studio albums with the band. In May 2019, it was announced that Hellyeah would tour for the first time since Abbott's death to support the final album he recorded with the band, Welcome Home. Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga was chosen as Abbott's replacement.Hellyeah announce first album, tour since Vinnie Paul's death Alternative Press =Collaborations= In November 2008, he handpicked several of his most memorable drum parts to demonstrate in a promotional video for the drum company ddrum: \\"Use My Third Arm\\", \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\", \\"13 Steps to Nowhere\\", \\"Domination\\", and \\"Becoming\\". In 2009, he started American Drummer Champions with the aide of friend and influence M. Ludowise, former Downset drummer. In August 2013, Abbott was featured in a music video for Black Label Society's cover of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\", appearing alongside a horse-masked Zakk Wylde. Wylde and Abbott were well known to be close friends, with Wylde also having been particularly close with Abbott's brother Darrell before his death in 2004. For several years, Abbott had been trying to publish a cookbook called Drumming up an Appetite with Vinnie Paul. Death On June 22, 2018, Abbott died at his Las Vegas home at the age of 54. It was later revealed that Abbott had died from a \\"dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease.\\" News of his death was initially released on the official Pantera Facebook page, stating only his association with the bands Pantera, Damageplan, and Hellyeah, along with a statement requesting that the privacy of his family be respected. Five days before his death, Abbott's final performance took place at The Vinyl at the Hard Rock Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas. Following his death, tributes from all over the metal community began pouring in, including members of Black Sabbath, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Megadeth, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Periphery, Slipknot, the Acacia Strain, In Flames, and many others. He is buried beside his mother, Carolyn, and brother, Darrell, at Moore Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, Texas. Equipment Paul performing with Hellyeah in 2013 Paul used Tama drums during the Cowboys from Hell album and tour from 1990 until 1992. On Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven albums and tours respectively, he used Remo drums. Paul endorsed Remo until The Great Southern Trendkill album, when he changed his endorsement to Pearl drums. He endorsed Pearl from 1996 until 2008, when he made his latest change to ddrum. Paul used Sabian cymbals and Vic Firth drumsticks throughout his career. He was also known for using triggered samples mixed with live-miced drums during live shows. , the following was Paul's setup for Hellyeah: Drums: ddrum Vinnie Paul signature series (All drums in his custom dragon finish modeled after the design on his hat, along other Hellyeah album art related designs) *24x24 bass drum x2 *14x14 tom *15x15 tom *18x18 floor tom *14x8 signature snare drum Cymbals: Sabian *12\\" Ice bell *14\\" AAX Metal Hi-Hats *18\\" Hand Hammered Rock Crash *20\\" AA Chinese *19\\" AA Rock Crash *19\\" AA Metal-X Crash *22\\" Hand Hammered Power Bell Ride *20\\" AA Chinese *14\\" AA Rock Hi-Hats *20\\" AA Metal-X Crash Sticks: Vic Firth Signature Series: Vinnie Paul (SVP), which he was known to play with backwards, hitting with the butt-end of the stick.

The Malabar District was annexed by the British through the Third Mysore War (1790‚Äì92) from Tipu Sultan. Before that, the Malabar District was under the Zamorins of Calicut since the Middle Ages.\\"Travancore.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 11 November 2011.Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial South India, 1863‚Äì1937: Contending with Marginality, RoutledgeCurzon, 2004, p. 30 According to the Indian census of 2011, there are approximately 33 million Malayalis in Kerala, making up 96.7% of the total population of the state. Malayali minorities are also found in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu, mainly in Kanyakumari district and Nilgiri district and Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka and also in other metropolitan areas of India. Over the course of the later half of the 20th century, significant Malayali communities have emerged in Persian Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait, and to a lesser extent, other developed nations with a primarily immigrant background such as the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. As of 2013, there were an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Malayali expatriates worldwide. According to A. R. Raja Raja Varma, Malayalam was the name of the place, before it became the name of the language spoken by the people. Etymology Malayalam, the native language of Malayalis, has its origin from the words mala meaning \\"mountain\\" and alam meaning \\"land\\" or \\"locality\\". ‚Äì go to the website and click the link ‚Äì language & literature to retrieve the information Hence the term Malayali refers to the people from the mountains who lived beyond the Western Ghats, and Malayalam the language that was spoken there. The Skanda Purana mentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal who is referred to as Manikkam Keralar (The Ruby King of Kerala), synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam temple.See Sahyadri Kanda Chapter 7 in Skanda Purana. Rocher, Ludo (1986). The Puranas. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag. .Who's Who in Madras 1934 Hence the term Keralar seem to precede the usage of the word Malayala/Malayalam. Geographic distribution and population According to the Indian census of 2001, there were 30,803,747 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.7% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (2.1% of the total number) in Tamil Nadu, 557,705 (1.7%) in Karnataka and 406,358 (1.2%) in Maharashtra. The number of Malayalam speakers in Lakshadweep is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2001. Of the total 33,066,392 Malayalam speakers in India in 2001, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the Yerava dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like Eranadan., censusindia.net As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages. Just before independence, Malaya attracted many Malaylis. Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in Chennai (Madras), Delhi, Bangalore, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Mumbai (Bombay) and Ahmedabad. Many Malayalis have also emigrated to the Middle East, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. There were 84,000 people with Malayali heritage in the United States, and an estimated 40,000 live in the new york tri-state area. https://unreachednewyork.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/11/Keralite-Profile-Final.pdf There were 7,093 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2006. The 2001 Canadian census reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mostly in the Greater Toronto Area and Southern Ontario. In 2010, the Census of Population of Singapore reported that there were 26,348 Malayalees in Singapore. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers.Statistics New Zealand:Language spoken (total responses) for the 1996‚Äì2006 censuses (Table 16) , stats.govt.nz 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in Fiji. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the Persian Gulf regions, especially in Bahrain, Muscat, Doha, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and European region mainly in London. The city of Chennai has the highest population of Malayalis in a metropolitan area outside Kerala, followed by Bangalore. Kerala Samajam, Mysore History and culture The Malayali live in an historic area known as the Malabar coast, which for thousands of years has been a major centre of the international spice trade, operating at least from the Roman era with Ptolemy documenting it on his map of the world in 150AD. For that reason, a highly distinct culture was created among the Malayali due to centuries of contact with foreign cultures through the spice trade. The arrival of the Cochin Jews, and the rise of Saint Thomas Christians in particular were very significant in shaping modern day Malayali culture. Later, Portuguese Latin Christians, Dutch Malabar, French Mahe, British English, and Arabian Muslim communities which arrived after 1498 left their mark as well making Kerala even more colourful, vibrant, and diverse. Malayalis can now be seen in all the countries of the world with the excellence of adaptation to any culture, food habits, language. In 2017, a detailed study of the evolution of the Singapore Malayalee community over a period of more than 100 years was published as a book: From Kerala to Singapore: Voices of the Singapore Malayalee Community. It is believed to be the first in-depth study of the presence of a NRI Malayalee community outside of Kerala. =Language and literature= Malayalam is the language spoken by the Malayalis. Malayalam is derived from Sanskrit and old Tamil in the 6th century. For cultural purposes Malayalam and Sanskrit formed a language known as Manipravalam, where both languages were used in an alternating style. Malayalam is the only language among the major Dravidian languages without diglossia. This means that the Malayalam which is spoken does not differ from the written variant. Malayalam is written using the Malayalam script. Malayalam literature is ancient in origin. The oldest literature works in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated between the 9th century and 11th century.Malayalam, R. E. Asher, T. C. Kumari, Routledge, , 1997. page 24. Malayalam literature includes the 14th century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry. The Triumvirate of poets (Kavithrayam: Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer) are recognized for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics and towards a more lyrical mode. In 19th century Chavara Kuriakose Elias, the founder of Carmelites of Mary Immaculate and Congregation of Mother of Carmel congregations, contribute different streams in the Malayalam Literature. All his works are written between 1829 and 1870. Chavara's contributionhttp://111.93.136.232:8080/cgi-bin/koha/opac- shelves.pl?viewshelf=181 to Malayalam literature includes, Chronicles, Poems ‚Äì athmanuthapam (compunction of the soul), Maranaveettil Paduvanulla Pana (Poem to sing in the bereaved house) and Anasthasiayude Rakthasakshyam ‚Äì and other Literary works . In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith awardees like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai and M. T. Vasudevan Nair and non Jnanpith awardees like Vaikom Muhammad Basheer have made valuable contributions to the Malayalam literature. World Malayali Council with its sister organisation, International Institute for Scientific and Academic Collaboration (IISAC) has come out with a comprehensive book on Kerala titled 'Introduction to Kerala Studies,‚Äô specially intended for the Malayali diaspora across the globe. J.V. Vilanilam, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala; Sunny Luke, medical scientist and former professor of Medical Biotechnology at Adelphi University, New York; and Antony Palackal, professor of Sociology at the Loyola College of Social Sciences in Thiruvananthapuram, have edited the book, besides making other contributions to it. =Tharavadu= Tharavadu is a system of joint family practised by Malayalis, especially castes Namboothiris, Ambalavasis, Nairs, Ezhavas and other prominent ethnoreligious groups. Each Tharavadu has a unique name. The Tharavadu was administered by the Karanavar, the oldest male member of the family. He would be the eldest maternal uncle of the family as well. The members of the Tharavadu consisted of mother, daughters, sons, sisters and brothers. The fathers and husbands had a very minimal role to play in the affairs of the Tharavadu. It was a true matrilineal affair. The Karanavar took all major decisions. He was usually autocratic. However, the consent of the eldest female member of the family was taken before implementing the decisions. This eldest female member would be his maternal grandmother, own mother, mother's sister, his own sister or a sister through his maternal lineage. Since the lineage was through the female members, the birth of a daughter was always welcomed. Each Tharavadu also has a Para Devatha (clan deity) revered by those in the particular Tharavadu. Temples were built to honour these deities. Kerala's society is less patriarchal than the rest of India... Certain Hindu communities such as the Nairs, and Muslims around Kannur, Varkala and Edava in Thiruvananthapuram used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as marumakkathayam which has in the recent years (post-Indian independence) ceased to exist. Christians, Muslims, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris and some Ezhavas follow makkathayam, a patrilineal system.. Kerala's gender relations are among the most equitable in India and the Majority World... =Architecture= A typical Nalukettu structure. Kerala, the native land of Malayalis has a tropical climate with excessive rains and intensive solar radiation. The architecture of this region has evolved to meet these climatic conditions by having the form of buildings with low walls, sloping roof and projecting caves. The setting of the building in the open garden plot was again necessitated by the requirement of wind for giving comfort in the humid climate. Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Malayali architecture. From the limitations of the materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Malayali architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The Kerala murals are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Malayali style of architecture. Nalukettu British Residency in Kollam, a two-storeyed Palace built by Col. John Munro between 1811 and 1819, with a blend of European-Indian-Tuscan architectural styles Nalukettu was a housing style in Kerala. Nalukettu is a quadrangular building constructed after following the Tachu Sastra (Science of Carpentry). It was a typical house which was flanked by out-houses and utility structures. The large house-Nalukettu is constructed within a large compound. It was called Nalukettu because it consisted of four wings around a central courtyard called Nadumuttom. The house has a quadrangle in the center. The quadrangle is in every way the center of life in the house and very useful for the performance of rituals. The layout of these homes was simple, and catered to the dwelling of numerous people, usually part of a tharavadu. Ettukettu (eight halls with two central courtyards) or Pathinarukettu (sixteen halls with four central courtyards) are the more elaborate forms of the same architecture. An example of a Nalukettu structure is Mattancherry Palace.-Malayalam Resource Centre =Performing arts and music= Kathakali Mohiniyattam Kalaripayattu posture Margamkali performed during a Syro-Malabar Nasrani wedding. Malayalis use two words to denote dance, which is attom and thullal. The art forms of Malayalis are classified into three types. They are (i)Religious like Theyyam, Bhagavatipattu etc., (ii)Semi religious like Sanghakali, Krishnanattom etc., and (iii)Secular like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Thullal etc. Kathakali and Mohiniyattam are the two classical dance forms from Kerala. Kathakali is actually a dance-drama. Mohiniyattam is a very sensual and graceful dance form that is performed both solo and in a group by women. Kutiyattam is a traditional performing art form from Kerala, which is recognised by UNESCO and given the status Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Ottamthullal is another performing art, which is also known as the poor man's Kathakali, which was created by the poet Kunchan Nambiar as an alternative to Chakiarkooth (another performing art), which was open only for higher castes to see. Theyyam is a ritualistic art form of Malayalis, which is thought to predate hinduism and to have developed from folk dances performed in conjunction with harvest celebrations. Theyyam is performed as an offering to gods so as to get rid of poverty and illness. Velakali is another ritualistic art form, mainly performed at temples in the festival time. Kolkali is a folk art in which dance performers move in a circle, striking small sticks and keeping rhythm with special steps. Many ancient Malayali family houses in Kerala have special snake shrines called Kavu. Sarpam Thullal is usually performed in the courtyard of houses having snake shrines. This is a votive offering for family wealth and happiness.Kerala Natanam ( ‡¥ï‡µá‡¥∞‡¥≥ ‡¥®‡¥ü‡¥®‡¥Ç ) (Kerala Dance) is a new style of dance that is now recognised as a distinct classical art form evolved from Kathakali. The Indian dancer Guru Gopinath ( ‡¥ó‡µÅ‡¥∞‡µÅ ‡¥ó‡µã‡¥™‡¥ø‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥•‡µç‚Äå ) a well-trained Kathakali artist and his wife Thankamani Gopinath developed this unique form of dance. Performing arts in Kerala is not limited to a single religion of the Malayali society. Muslim Mappilas, Nasranis and Latin Christians have their own unique performing art forms. Duff Muttu, also known as Dubh Muttu/Aravanamuttu is a performing art form prevalent among the Muslim community. It is a group performance, staged as a social event during festivals and nuptial ceremonies. Oppana is a popular form of social entertainment among the Muslim community. It is a form accompanied by clapping of hands, in which both men and women participate. Margamkali is a performing art which is popular among the Saint Thomas Christians. It combines both devotion and entertainment, and was performed by men in groups. Since 1980's women also have found groups. The dancers themselves sing the margamkali songs in unison call and response form.Parichamuttukali is another performing art which is popular among Saint Thomas Christians. This is an artistic adaptation of the martial art of Kerala, Kalaripayattu. Chavittu nadakom is a theatrical art form observed mainly by Kerala Latin Christians, dating back to the second half of the 16th century. However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms ‚Äì including those heavily based on the use of often risqu√© and politically incorrect mimicry and parody ‚Äì have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. Since 1930 when the first Malayalam film Vigathakumaran was released and over the following decade or two, Malayalam Cinema had grown to become one of the popular means of expression for both works of fiction and social issues, and it remains so. Music formed a major part of early Malayalam literature, which is believed to have started developing by 9th century CE. The significance of music in the culture of Kerala can be established just by the fact that in Malayalam language, musical poetry was developed long before prose. Kerala is musically known for Sopanam. Sopanam is religious in nature, and developed through singing invocatory songs at the Kalam of Kali, and later inside temples. Sopanam came to prominence in the wake of the increasing popularity of Jayadeva's Gita Govinda or Ashtapadis. Sopana sangeetham (music), as the very name suggests, is sung by the side of the holy steps (sopanam) leading to the sanctum sanctorum of a shrine. It is sung, typically employing plain notes, to the accompaniment of the small, hourglass-shaped ethnic drum called idakka, besides the chengila or the handy metallic gong to sound the beats. Sopanam is traditionally sung by men of the Marar and Pothuval community, who are Ambalavasi (semi-Brahmin) castes engaged to do it as their hereditary profession. Kerala is also home of Carnatic music. Legends like Swati Tirunal, Shadkala Govinda Maarar, Sangitha Vidwan Gopala Pillai Bhagavathar, Chertala Gopalan Nair, M. D. Ramanathan, T.V.Gopalakrishnan, M.S. Gopalakrishnan, L. Subramaniam T.N. Krishnan & K. J. Yesudas are Malayali musicians. Also among the younger generations with wide acclaim and promise is Child Prodigy Violinist L. Athira Krishna etc., who are looked upon as maestros of tomorrow. Kerala also has a significant presence of Hindustani music as well. The king of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal patronaged and contributed much to the Hindustani Music. The pulluvar of Kerala are closely connected to the serpent worship. One group among these people consider the snake gods as their presiding deity and perform certain sacrifices and sing songs. This is called Pulluvan Pattu. The song conducted by the pulluvar in serpent temples and snake groves is called Sarppapaattu, Naagam Paattu, Sarpam Thullal, Sarppolsavam, Paambum Thullal or Paambum Kalam. Mappila Paattukal or Mappila Songs are folklore Muslim devotional songs in the Malayalam language. Mappila songs are composed in colloquial Malayalam and are sung in a distinctive tune. They are composed in a mixture of Malayalam and Arabic. Film music, which refers to playback singing in the context of Indian music, forms the most important canon of popular music in India. Film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state. =Vallam Kali= Vallamkali- Nehru Trophy Boat Race Vallam Kali, is the race of country made boats. It is mainly conducted during the season of the harvest festival Onam in Autumn. Vallam Kali include races of many kinds of traditional boats of Kerala. The race of Chundan Vallam (snake boat) is the major item. Hence Vallam Kali is also known in English as Snake Boat Race and a major tourist attraction. Other types of boats which do participate in various events in the race are Churulan Vallam, Iruttukuthy Vallam, Odi Vallam, Veppu Vallam (Vaipu Vallam), Vadakkanody Vallam, and Kochu Vallam. Nehru Trophy Boat Race is one the famous Vallam Kali held in Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha district of Kerala. Champakulam Moolam Boat Race is the oldest and most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. The race is held on river Pamba on the moolam day (according to the Malayalam Era) of the Malayalam month Midhunam, the day of the installation of the deity at the Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Temple. The Aranmula Boat Race takes place at Aranmula, near a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna and Arjuna. The President's Trophy Boat Race is a popular event conducted in Ashtamudi Lake in Kollam. Thousands of people gather on the banks of the river Pamba to watch the snake boat races. Nearly 50 snake boats or chundan vallams participate in the festival. Payippad Jalotsavam is a three-day water festival. It is conducted in Payippad Lake which is 35 km from Alappuzha district of Kerala state. There is a close relation between this Payippad boat race and Subramanya Swamy Temple in Haripad. Indira Gandhi Boat Race is a boat race festival celebrated in the last week of December in the backwaters of Kochi, a city in Kerala. This boat race is one of the most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. This festival is conducted to promote Kerala tourism. =Festivals= Onam pookkalam/floral carpet Malayalis celebrate a variety of festivals, namely Onam, Christmas, Vishu (Malayalam New Year), Easter, Ramadan and Bakrid. =Cuisine= Kerala Sadya Malayali cuisine is not homogeneous and regional variations are visible throughout. Spices form an important ingredient in almost all curries. Kerala is known for its traditional sadhyas, a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes. The sadhya is complemented by payasam, a sweet milk dessert native to Kerala. The sadhya is, as per custom, served on a banana leaf. Traditional dishes include sambar, aviyal, kaalan, theeyal, thoran, injipully, pulisherry, appam, kappa (tapioca), puttu (steamed rice powder), and puzhukku. Coconut is an essential ingredient in most of the food items and is liberally used. Puttu is a culinary specialty in Kerala. It is a steamed rice cake which is a favourite breakfast of most Malayalis. It is served with either brown chickpeas cooked in a spicy gravy, papadams and boiled small green lentils, or tiny ripe yellow Kerala plantains. In the highlands there is also a variety of puttu served with paani (the boiled-down syrup from sweet palm toddy) and sweet boiled bananas. to steam the puttu, there is a special utensil called \\"Puttu Kutti\\". It consists of two sections. The lower bulkier portion is where the water for steaming is stored. The upper detachable leaner portion is separated from lower portion by perforated lids so as to allow the steam to pass through and bake the rice powder. Appam is a pancake made of fermented batter. The batter is made of rice flour and fermented using either yeast or toddy, the local spirit. It is fried using a special frying pan called appa-chatti and is served with egg curry, chicken curry, mutton stew, vegetable curry and chick pea curry. =Martial arts= Common weapons used as part of Kalaripayatt Malayalis have their own form of martial arts called Kalaripayattu. This type of martial arts was used as defensive mechanism against intruders. In ancient times, disputes between nobles (naaduvazhis or Vazhunors) were also settled by the outcome of a Kalaripayattu tournament. This ancient martial art is claimed as the mother of all martial arts. The word \\"kalari\\" can be traced to ancient Sangam literature.Suresh, P. R. (2005). Kalari Payatte ‚Äì The martial art of Kerala. Anthropologists estimate that Kalarippayattu dates back to at least the 12th century CE.Zarrilli, Phillip B. A South Indian Martial Art and the Yoga and Ayurvedic Paradigms. University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The historian Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai attributes the birth of Kalaripayattu to an extended period of warfare between the Cheras and the Cholas in the 11th century CE. What eventually crystallized into this style is thought to have been a product of existing South Indian styles of combat, combined with techniques brought by other cultures. Kalaripayattu may be one of the oldest martial arts in existence. The oldest western reference to Kalaripayattu is a 16th-century travelogue of Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese explorer. The southern style, which stresses importance of hand-to-hand combat, is slightly different than Kalari in the north.Phillip B.

In March 2014, Guadalajara had announced that M√°rquez Lugo had injured the same left knee. He was successfully operated on April 1 and was expected to return in 3‚Äì4 months. During physical therapy M√°rquez Lugo complained that the pain would not alleviate and after further examination from the club doctor, Dr. Rafael Ortega, it was announced that he needed to have a cartilage transplant. Surgery was performed on 19 August 2014 and Dr. Ortega informed the public that M√°rquez Lugo would be ruled out of action for approximately 6 months. M√°rquez Lugo's recovery was taking longer than the doctor expected, and his knee was not improving. On April 22, 2015 during a news interview with TDN Deportes, M√°rquez Lugo announced his retirement from play after three surgeries and a year-long battle he had failed to win against his knee injury. M√°rquez Lugo is the second player to retire while with the club after various leg issues, the first being Sergio √Åvila in 2011. International career M√°rquez Lugo made numerous appearances for Mexico youth national teams, including the U-20 and U-23 levels. He appeared in the 2004 Summer Olympics with the Under-23 squad. He has also was called up by Ricardo Lavolpe to play for the Mexico national football team, which included call-ups to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup. M√°rquez Lugo was announced as one of the 3 over-aged players named to the U-22 team that represented Mexico in the 2011 Copa Am√©rica. M√°rquez Lugo appeared in all three of Mexico's matches before they were eliminated. = Internationals goals = - !scope=row1  January 25, 2012  Reliant Stadium, Houston, United States   align=center2‚Äì1  align=center3‚Äì1  Friendly } Honours =Club= ;Pachuca *North American SuperLiga: 2007 ;Atlante *CONCACAF Champions League: 2008‚Äì09 ;Morelia * North American SuperLiga: 2010 =Individual= *Best Striker of the tournament: Clausura 2011 References External links Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Club Universidad Nacional footballers Category:Monarcas Morelia footballers Category:C.F.

It is situated 35 kilometres southeast of Whanganui and 40 kilometres northwest of Palmerston North. NgƒÅti Apa are tangata whenua for the Marton area. The town of Marton is the largest in the Rangitikei district, and began life as a private township in 1866, when shop and housing sections were sold at auction by local landowners. At the time of the 2013 census, the town had 4,548 residents. Marton has always been a service town for the fertile farming region of the Manawatu Plains. Butter, wool, and flour have been among its agricultural products. The arrival of the railway in 1878 led to rapid growth in the area, which soon added industries such as engineering, sawmilling, and textile production to its economy. History For three years the small village was known as Tutaenui, named after the stream running through its centre. In 1869 local citizens changed the name to Marton to honour the birthplace of Captain James Cook in Middlesbrough, marking his landing in New Zealand exactly 100 years earlier. It is not known if this change of name was influenced by the mistranslation of 'tutae' (meaning 'dung') and 'nui' (meaning 'large').Ngata dictionary ‚Äî Learning Media (Actual translation: 'tu' -stand, 'tae' -arrive, 'nui' big; i.e., a 'big gathering'). From the start Marton was an ideal supply centre for district farmers, who first began arriving in the early 1850s. From butter and wool they moved on to growing wheat in 1863, and big crops led to three flourmills being launched in the area in 1864. After the town itself opened up in 1866, general stores, two hotels and several blacksmiths soon started. Marton became a home base for the horse industry, with saddlers, wheelwrights, livery stables and coachbuilders competing for business, while Clydesdale and Suffolk Punch sires toured the district to build up the population of plough horses needed as new farms sprang into being. The opening of the railway line joining Wanganui to Palmerston North in 1878, now part of the North Island Main Trunk railway (towards Palmerston North and Auckland) and the Marton - New Plymouth Line (towards Wanganui), turned Marton Railway Station into a thriving railway junction, and it held that position for the next 100 years. Timber from Rangitikei forests served the town's two timbermills, the first from 1889 onwards. Main Street in Marton circa 1924 Industry developed quietly at first in Marton, starting with flourmilling, brickmaking and wool presses. By the late 1950s there was an incredible array of industries and factories in action. They turned out products as diverse as men's shirts, tractor safety cabs, soft drinks, vegetable salads, readymix concrete, field tiles, dog biscuits, knitwear, dried peas, electronic petrol pumps, vegetable digging machinery. 9 km from Marton was the large Lake Alice Hospital for psychiatric patients, which opened in 1950 and closed in 1999. It included a maximum security unit, and housed hundreds of patients during its 49 years of operation. Government and politics =Local government= Rangitikei District Council offices on 46 High Street, Marton. The current Mayor of the Rangitikei District is Andy Watson. Marton is served by four ward councillors on the Rangitikei District Council; these are Cath Ash, Nigel Belsham, Dave Wilson and Lynne Sheridan. All were elected at the 2016 local elections and are due for re-election in October 2019. =National government= Marton is located in the general electorate of Rangitƒ´kei and in the MƒÅori electorate of Te Tai HauƒÅuru. Rangitƒ´kei is a safe National Party seat since the 1938 election with the exception of 1978‚Äì1984 when it was held by Bruce Beetham of the Social Credit Party. Since 2011 it is held by Ian McKelvie. Te Tai HauƒÅuru is a more volatile seat, having been held by three different parties since 1996, i.e. New Zealand First, the MƒÅori Party and the Labour Party. Since 2014 it is held by Adrian Rurawhe of the Labour Party. Education Marton has four co-educational state primary schools for Year 1 to 8 students: Marton School, with a roll of ; Marton Junction School, with a roll of ; James Cook School, with a roll of ; and South Makirikiri School, with a roll of , There are also two other primary schools. St Matthew's School is a state-integrated Catholic primary school, with a roll of . Huntley School is a private Anglican boarding school, with a roll of . Rangitikei College is a co-educational state primary school, with a roll of . Nga Tawa Diocesan School is a state- integrated girls' boarding school for Year 9 to 13 students, with a roll of . Until 2016 there was a third secondary schools, Turakina MƒÅori Girls' College. Demographics Marton had a population of 4,548 according to the 2013 New Zealand census. This is a decrease of 132, or 2.8 percent, since the 2006 census. There were 1,920 occupied dwellings, 198 unoccupied dwellings, and 3 dwellings under construction. Of the residential population, 2,169 (47.7%) were male compared to 48.7% nationally, and 2,376 (52.2%) were female, compared to 51.3% nationally. The town had a median age of 44.0 years, 6.0 years above the national median age of 38.0 years. People aged 65 and over made up 22.5% of the population, compared to 14.3% nationally, and people under 15 years made up 20.2%, compared to 20.4% nationally. Marton's ethnicity is made up of (national figures in brackets): 76.5% European (74.0%), 22.8% MƒÅori (14.9%), 1.9% Asian (11.8%), 7.8% Pacific Islanders (7.4%), 0.1% Middle Eastern, Latin American or African (1.2%), and 2.0% Other (2.5%). Marton had an unemployment rate of 8.9% of people 15 years and over, compared to 7.4% nationally. The median annual income of all people 15 years and over was $21,500, compared to $28,500 nationally. Of those, 46.8% earned under $20,000, compared to 38.2% nationally, while 13.8% earned over $50,000, compared to 26.7% nationally. Transport The nearest airports to the town are Whanganui Airport, located 37 km west, and Palmerston North Airport, located 44 km southeast. Both airports are domestic only. Marton is on the North Island Main Trunk Line; and on the Marton-New Plymouth Line which leaves the NIMT at Marton. However although the Overlander on the NIMT used to stop at Marton railway station, the replacement Northern Explorer introduced in 2012 has fewer stops and does not stop at Marton. Climate Marton's climate is temperate and has few extremes compared to many parts of New Zealand. Summers are warm with average temperatures in the low 20s. The most settled weather occurs in summer and early autumn. Winters are mild and annual rainfall is moderate. Annual hours of bright sunshine can average over 2,000.

He was a full-back in the Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s. Early career Cooper was not discovered as a young player in the conventional manner - he simply turned up at Leeds United one day with his football boots in a paper bag, asking for a trial. He was granted his wish and impressed enough to be offered an apprentice contract. Initially a left winger, Cooper was converted to a defensive role by Leeds boss Don Revie on signing at the age of 17. He made gradual progress in the first team over the next six years until Revie decided to make him the permanent No.3 in 1966. Cooper settled in thereafter earning a reputation as a full back of innovation, showing that the right levels of fitness, skill and an ability to cross the ball meant he could perform a devastating overlap down the left flank to support much feared winger Eddie Gray, this was so successful it became a trademark of Leeds play. He could also 'go inside', joining attacks centrally and scoring some important goals. 1960s In 1968, Leeds won the League Cup against Arsenal at Wembley. A poor and occasionally high-tempered match was settled by Cooper's volley after a corner had been half-cleared, although Arsenal claimed their goalkeeper had been fouled by central defender Jack Charlton. Cooper subsequently featured in the team which won the Fairs Cup in the same season. In 1969, Leeds won the League championship with Cooper making his contribution. Revie did not buy a reserve left back but instead used the utility player Paul Madeley to replace Cooper in the event of injury or suspension - an indication that Cooper was the finished article. This was further proved when he was given his debut for England by Alf Ramsey against France the same year, and England won 5‚Äì0 with Cooper putting on a classy individual showing. 1970s Leeds chased three trophies in 1970 but lost the championship by nine points to Everton, and went out of the European Cup to Celtic in the semi-finals. Cooper played a full role in these near-misses, and also featured in the FA Cup final against Chelsea which Leeds lost 2-1 after a replay. In the summer, Cooper gave an excellent series of performances as England's first choice left back at the World Cup in Mexico, which ended with defeat in the quarter-finals to West Germany. Leeds won the Fairs Cup again in 1971 but missed out on the League on the last day. One consolation for Cooper on a personal level was that this was his best season for appearances, missing just one League game all season. He seemed set to follow suit the next season as Leeds again chased League and FA Cup honours, but then suffered a broken leg in April 1972 during a League game at Stoke City. Aside from missing that season's FA Cup final victory over Arsenal, Cooper missed a whole 20 months of football, such were the complications of the injury. Even when he did return to action, he played only one more international game, against Portugal in 1974, after Don Revie had become England manager. Revie, unable to use Madeley who was already deputising as a central defender due to Jack Charlton's retirement, bought Trevor Cherry in the summer of 1972 as a replacement. Cooper also missed the 1973 FA Cup final defeat to Sunderland and the European Cup Winners Cup final loss to A.C. Milan. When he did come back, it was with just one appearance in the 1974 season, thereby missing out on a League championship medal - Leeds won it with a 29-match unbeaten start - due to a lack of games. Cooper's Leeds career was effectively over by the time he regained his fitness. The departure of Revie for the England job in 1974 and the emergence over the next season of Frank Gray, younger brother of Eddie, as well as the presence of Cherry, rendered Cooper surplus to requirements. He left the club in 1975 to join Middlesbrough who were managed by former Leeds teammate Charlton. Later career After three years with Middlesbrough, he moved on to Bristol City for a year, before becoming player-manager of rivals Bristol Rovers. He subsequently assisted and played for his former Leeds skipper Billy Bremner at Doncaster Rovers, and had a second spell playing for and managing Bristol City, whom he led to two Freight Rover Trophy finals, winning the trophy in 1986. His management career also took in a period at the helm of Birmingham City sandwiched between two spells at Exeter City. His first spell at Exeter yielded the Fourth Division title in 1990, and he moved to Birmingham City the following year, achieving promotion from the Third Division in his first season at the helm. He resigned as Birmingham manager in December 1993 and returned to Exeter later that season, although too late to keep them in Division Two. The club then went into receivership and despite surviving liquidation, the club finished bottom of the Football League in 1994-95 and only held on to their league status because Macclesfield Town did not meet the league's stadium capacity requirements. Cooper was then replaced by Peter Fox and has not returned to management. He spent 11 years as Southampton's chief European scout before retiring in 2007. He now lives in Tenerife. Cooper's son Mark became a footballer in the late 1980s, enjoying a worthy career in the lower echelons of the professional game. He is now also a manager. His grandson, Charlie, is also a footballer.

According to 'World Music: The Rough Guide', \\"nowhere is the English living tradition more in evidence than the border lands of Northumbria, the one part of England to rival the counties of the west of Ireland for a rich unbroken tradition.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 67. The region is particularly noted for its tradition of border ballads, the Northumbrian smallpipe (a form of bagpipe unique to North East England) and also a strong fiddle tradition in the region that was already well established in the 1690s. Northumbrian music is characterised by considerable influence from other regions (and vice versa), particularly southern Scotland and other parts of the north of England, as well as Irish immigrants.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 67. Local musical forms and styles Northumbria shares with southern Scotland the long history of border ballads, such as 'The Ballad of Chevy Chase'.J. Reed, Border Ballads: a Selection (Routledge, 2004). It is also known for local dances, namely rapper dancing and Durham and Northumberland style clog dancing.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 66. The dance music of Northumbria differs markedly in style form that of the rest of England. It has more in common with Irish dance music, and especially Scottish dance music. Yet is to some extent unique. Many dances from the region have the characteristic rant step.http://www.colinhume.com/dtrant.htm Although many tunes are shared with other regions of England or other nations, there is often a distinct difference between a Northumbrian version of a tune and versions from elsewhere. For instance a simple Irish tune, 'The Chorus Jig', with three strains, appears in the Northumbrian tradition as 'Holey Ha'penny', an ornate five-strain variation set. A Scottish strathspey, 'Struan Robertson's Rant' appears, stripped of the Scotch snap, as a smallpipe tune, 'Cuckold come out of the Amrey', a long variation set. These two examples illustrate the impossibility of ascribing a regional origin to an old tune; each can be played on a primitive instrument, and may have been played for as long before first publication, as they have been since. Assumptions of regional origins can bedevil the study of music undertaken by enthusiastic musicians (who may sadly follow partisan allegiances) however regional versions and styles (like Northumbrian) are quite a different matter, having reliable established sources. Tunes in hornpipe rhythm are much appreciated in the region, both for playing and for dancing, particularly clog dancing. One rhythm characteristic of the region is the rant, used for figure dances such as The Morpeth Rant with a characteristic step; musically it is similar to a reel, though somewhat slower, and with more of a lilt. During 1770‚Äì2 William Vickers made a manuscript collection of local dance tunes, of which some 580 survive, including both pipe and fiddle tunes, many of which are from Scotland, southern England, Ireland and even France, revealing the very extensive and varied repertoire of local musicians at that time.M. Seattle, ed., William Vickers, The Great Northern Tune Book, 2nd ed. (English Folk Dance and Song Society with the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2008). Bagpipe music UOTC pipers from the 1920s playing half-long pipes. In the later medieval period pipe music appears to have been characterized by the use of the Northumbrian 'war pipe', which may have been the ancestor of the Great Highland Bagpipe, but no example has survived.F. M. Collinson, The Bagpipe: The History of a Musical Instrument (Routledge, 1975), p. 117. It appears to have been replaced in the region by the eighteenth century by a variety of pipes, ranging from the conical bore, open-ended border pipes, to the cylindrically bored smallpipes; the closed-ended form with its single octave compass and closed fingering is known to have existed since the seventeenth century, and open- ended forms were also known.F. M. Collinson, The Bagpipe: The History of a Musical Instrument (Routledge, 1975), pp. 118‚Äì19. The Union or Pastoral pipes, the precursor of the Irish Uilleann pipes, are also known to have been played and made in the region.F. M. Collinson, The Bagpipe: The History of a Musical Instrument (Routledge, 1975), p. 117. The earliest known bagpipe manuscript from the UK is a tunebook by William Dixon of Stamfordham in Northumberland, dated 1733. This includes forty tunes with extensive sets of variations. Some of the tunes correspond to later versions of known smallpipe tunes; others, with a nine-note compass, must have been played either on Border pipes or on an open-ended smallpipe, like the Scottish smallpipes. Billy Purvis (1784‚Äì1853) one of the last travelling minstrel pipers of the south of Scotland and the North East of England. Playing a Union pipe early-nineteenth century. In the early nineteenth century, makers such as John Dunn and Robert and James Reid added keys to the closed-ended smallpipe, extending its range to almost two octaves. With its greater flexibility, the instrument became more fashionable at this time. On the other hand, the Border pipes seem not to have been found in Northumberland much after the middle of the century, though they were revived as the 'half-long pipes' in the 1920s and more successfully in the 1970s and 80s. Many families have been associated with traditional Northumbrian piping. Will Allan (Old Wull) and his son James (Jemmy) were noted pipers in the eighteenth century: James played on several occasions for the Countess of Northumberland. In 1756 Joseph Turnbull was appointed piper to the Countess. The Percy family have continued to maintain a piper to this day. Contrary to popular tradition, the Duke's current piper, Richard Butler, has written that \\"there is no record in the Percy Archives (Alnwick Castle) recording that James Allan was Piper to the Duchess or Duke\\". Turnbull's pupil, John Peacock was probably the first Northumbrian piper to play a keyed chanter. Most notably, the Clough family of Newsham produced six generations of pipers, including Tom Clough, who made an important early recording in 1929, and taught many pipers, including Billy Pigg.J. Connell and C. Gibson, Sound Tracks: Popular Music, Identity, and Place (Routledge, 2003), p. 34. Fiddle music The earliest source of music for fiddle from Northumberland is Henry Atkinson's tunebook from the 1690s. This includes tunes current in both the southern English and Scottish music of the time. A later source, unfortunately lost, was John Smith's tunebook from 1750. Some tunes from this were copied out by John Stokoe in the nineteenth century: these include an extended set of variations on the song The Keel Row for fiddle (the earliest known version), pipe tunes with variations such as Bold Wilkinson, and a version of Jacky Layton with variations for fiddle. It is clear that as in Scotland, the playing of extended variation sets on the fiddle was current in Northumberland at the time. A slightly later source, the William Vickers manuscript, from 1770, and also for fiddle, contains 580 simple dance tunes, but few variation sets. In the nineteenth century the most notable feature of the region's music was the popularity of the hornpipe in 4/4 time, and in particular the very influential playing of the publican, fiddler and composer James Hill. His compositions include 'The High Level Bridge', 'The Great Exhibition', 'The Beeswing', 'The Hawk' and many others. Many other fine tunes have been attributed to him, but these include some he cannot possibly have written. Another local composer, in the later 19th century, was the fiddler and dancing master Robert Whinham, some 60 of whose compositions survive, notably the hornpipe 'Remember Me', and 'Whinham's Reel'. In the early- and mid-twentieth century, influential fiddlers included Ned Pearson, Jim Rutherford, Adam Gray, George Hepple and Jake Hutton, father of the noted piper Joe Hutton. John Armstrong of Carrick played with the piper Billy Pigg. In the later part of the century, Willy Taylor was perhaps the most highly respected of the many fiddlers in the region. Other instruments Other musical instruments which have been used in the region include the flute and piccolo. Some nineteenth-century manuscripts contain tunes which are in keys and registers appropriate to the flute. Billy Ballantine was a piccolo player from the west of the region, who played for dances in the mid-twentieth century. The style of his playing was very distinctive, mixing staccato notes for rhythmic emphasis with more ornate passages. He made recordings of tunes like the Kielder Schottische and The Gilsland Hornpipe for the BBC. Billy Conroy made some recordings on home-made whistles. Free reed instruments have been of growing importance since their development in the nineteenth century. In particular the mouth organ or \\"moothie\\" was played notably by Will Atkinson. As elsewhere in England the melodeon has been used for dance music. Folk revivals The first folk revival in the region tended to circulate around folk dance, the collection of border ballads and, from the later 1870s, the revival of interest in pipe music. John Bell collected many tunes and songs from the region in the early nineteenth century.J. Bell, ed., Rhymes of Northern Bards: Being a Curious Collection of Old and New Songs and Poems Peculiar to the Counties of Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland and Durham (1812), rpt. with an introduction by David Harker (Frank Graham, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1971) Later on, in the middle of the century the Ancient Melodies Committee of the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries attempted a more comprehensive collection, based largely on manuscript and printed sources; this was later edited for publication by John Collingwood Bruce and John Stokoe.B. J. Collingwood, and J. Stokoe, eds, Northumbrian Minstrelsy: A Collection of the Ballads, Melodies, and Small-Pipe Tunes of Northumbria (Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1882); and F. Kidson, English Folk-Song and Dance (Read Books, 2008), p. 42. The Northumbrian Small Pipes Society was founded in Newcastle in 1893; although it was short-lived, only continuing until 1900, it ran a series of competitions, won by Henry Clough and Richard Mowat. The Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded in 1928, and are generally credited with helping to keep the distinctive tradition alive.A. Baines, Woodwind Instruments and Their History (Courier Dover, 1991), p. 328. The first recordings of the Northumbrian smallpipes were made in the late 1920s, including the HMV recording of Tom Clough. Border ballads were a major part of those collected by Francis James Child and make up most of the sixth volume of his ten volume collection of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882‚Äì98).J. Reed, Border Ballads: A Selection (Routledge, 2004), p. 10. The second folk revival saw a number of acts drawing on this work, and enjoying some success. Probably the most influential piper from the region was Billy Pigg, but other important pipers in the mid-twentieth century include G. G. Armstrong, George Atkinson, Jack Armstrong, and Joe Hutton.J. Connell, C. Gibson, Sound Tracks: Popular Music, Identity, and Place (Routledge, 2003), p. 34. Figures such Louis Killen, The High Level Ranters and Bob Davenport brought Northumbrian folk to national and international audiences.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), pp. 67‚Äì8. The most successful folk group from the region in the 1970s were Lindisfarne, who played progressive folk music with some local stylings. Much more concerned with traditional music from the region were the group that splintered from them in 1973 Jack the Lad, and another group from which they gained some members Hedgehog Pie, who, for a time, provided a regional answer to the British folk rock of bands like Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span. These groups have been seen as continuing an exploration of regional identity through folk music.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 68. Between their demise and revival in the 1990s, the local scene continued through groups like the more traditional Doonan family, which contained some of the finest folk flute players in the region.'Doonan family', NME Artists, http://www.nme.com/artists/doonan-family-band, retrieved 15/02/09. These groups have been seen as continuing an exploration of regional identity through folk music.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 68. Another prolific figure from the 1970s to 2000s was Eric Boswell. While best known for writing the Christmas song Little Donkey, Boswell's local ballads like I've Got A Little Whippet, Sweet Waters Of Tyne and Tyneside's Where I Come From often featured on Tyne Tees and at Newcastle City Hall Geordierama concerts and The Little Waster Bobby Thompson and various others made recordings. Boswell's songs continue to be performed in folk clubs. Colin Ross, has been influential not only as a player and teacher of the Northumbrian pipes, but has also been an important pipemaker, as David G. Burleigh was. Distinctive local sounds were much more marked in the next generation of traditional Northumbrian folk musicians such as Ed Pickford and Jez Lowe, who have reinvigorated the local scene and artists like fiddler Nancy Kerr and piper Kathryn Tickell have gained international reputations, appearing on records with artists including Kate Rusby, Eliza Carthy and even Sting.S.

Flax tows are often used as upholstery stuffing and oakum. Tows in general are frequently cut up to produce staple fibre. The very light color of flax tow is the source of the word \\"towhead\\", meaning a person with naturally light blonde hair.  Composite materials  In the artificial fibre and composites industries, a tow is an untwisted bundle of continuous filaments, in particular of acrylic, carbon fibres, or viscose rayon. Tows are designated either by their total tex (mass in grams per 1000 m length) or by the number of fibres they contain. For example, a 12K tow contains 12,000 fibres. Spread tow fabrics are woven sheet materials, used for composite layup, where the warp and weft are flat tows, rather than spun yarns, in order to provide the maximum strength as a composite.

A is a common type of karaoke establishment commonly found in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the United States and Canada. It originated in Japan, and it is now popular around the world, but especially in Asia and it has been a popular leisure activity in Hong Kong since as late as the 1980s when it was first seen as a source of entertainment for the youth. Karaoke boxes consist of multiple rooms containing karaoke equipment, usually rented out for a period of time. A typical karaoke box establishment contains 10‚Äì20 (or more) such rooms, that can be themed so that each room has a different feeling or can be a traditional karaoke box, as well as have a main karaoke bar area in the front. Karaoke box establishments often sell beverages, and sometimes food but sometimes the establishment offers free refreshments. Many people of all ages enjoy karaoke as a pastime in Japan, as it still has a huge influence in the Japanese music scene and it is also a place that can attract tourists as well. One blogger, who is a fan of karaoke, writes \\"...to sing karaoke is to embrace the moment that your love of song transcends your love of self.\\" While people do go to and enjoy karaoke boxes with family and friends, people also go by themselves and are able to enjoy the comfort of performing in the room by themselves. There is also a different style of karaoke, the traditional type where the patrons sing in front of everyone that is also still offered in popular entertainment areas, rather than the private boxes. A new trend of karaoke booth have shown up in Chinese shopping malls where customers can enter a booth, similar to a photo-booth, that allows them to perform different songs. The booths are cheaper than the traditional karaoke box, as they do not have to rent a room but just go in and sing a number of songs. The booths are very similar to the karaoke boxes but on a more intimate scale, with at least 20,000 booths running with an estimated 3.18 billion yuan in the 2017. The booths have an air conditioner, seats for the customers, the karaoke equipment, and headsets. Another trend that has popped up recently, as Itochu Corp., which has its usually services in karaoke boxes has recently began offering their boxes for daytime meetings for business who need a cheap business room, as their starting price start at about $10.00 an hour. There has also been conversation about fire safety with karaoke boxes after an arson in Hong Kong which led to public concern about their safety. There has been research where they recreated an establishment with 3 boxes and a corridor, in a remote location in China, which was designed with the intention of testing a real-time fire in a karaoke establishment. There has also been additional research about karaoke boxes as to ensure the safety of the customers in evacuation research about widening the length of hallways. The term karaoke box is primarily used in Japan, Hong Kong and Macau. Karaoke box establishments are commonly known as KTV (an abbreviation of karaoke television) in Taiwan, China, Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore, the United States and Canada, videoke in the Philippines, noraebang (ÎÖ∏ÎûòÎ∞©) in South Korea (literally meaning singing room), karaoke room in Vietnam, and karaoke club in Sri Lanka. It is also common to simply abbreviate it as K in Hong Kong Cantonese, often when used as a verb, for example ÂéªKÊ≠å (to go K songs) or ÂéªÂî±K (to go sing K).

The gallery's history starts in 1856 when the Moscow merchant Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov acquired works by Russian artists of his day with the aim of creating a collection, which might later grow into a museum of national art. In 1892, Tretyakov presented his already famous collection of approximately 2,000 works (1,362 paintings, 526 drawings, and 9 sculptures) to the Russian nation.Korolev & Iovleva (1992), 13\\"The donation of the Gallery to Moscow, 1892-1898\\". The State Tretyakov Gallery website. Accessed 24 March 2012. The fa√ßade of the gallery building was designed by the painter Viktor Vasnetsov in a peculiar Russian fairy-tale style. It was built in 1902‚Äì04 to the south from the Moscow Kremlin. During the 20th century, the gallery expanded to several neighboring buildings, including the 17th-century church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. The collection contains more than 130,000 exhibits, ranging from Theotokos of Vladimir and Andrei Rublev's Trinity to the monumental Composition VII by Wassily Kandinsky and the Black Square by Kazimir Malevich. In 1977 the Gallery kept a significant part of the George Costakis collection. In May 2012, the Tretyakov Art Gallery played host to the prestigious FIDE World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand as the organizers felt the event would promote both chess and art at the same time. Kasimir Malevich, Black Square (1915) History Vasily Surikov, The Morning of the Streltsy Execution (1881) The Archangel Michael (13th c.). Pavel Tretyakov started collecting art in the middle of 1850. The founding year of the Tretyakov Gallery is considered to be 1856, when Tretyakov purchased two paintings of Russian artists: Temptation by N. G. Schilder and Skirmish with Finnish Smugglers by V. G. Kudyakov, although earlier, in 1854‚Äì1855, he had bought 11 drawings and nine pictures by Dutch Old Masters. In 1867 the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov was opened. The Gallery‚Äôs collection consisted of 1,276 paintings, 471 sculptures and 10 drawings by Russian artists, as well as 84 paintings by foreign masters. In August 1892 Tretyakov presented his art gallery to the city of Moscow as a gift. In the collection at this time, there were 1,287 paintings and 518 graphic works of the Russian school, 75 paintings and eight drawings of European schools, 15 sculptures and a collection of icons. The official opening of the museum called the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov took place on August 15, 1893. The gallery was located in a mansion that the Tretykov family had purchased in 1851. As the Tretyakov collection of art grew, the residential part of the mansion filled with art and it became necessary to make additions to the mansion in order to store and display the works of art. Additions were made in 1873, 1882, 1885, 1892 and 1902‚Äì1904, when there was the famous fa√ßade, designed in 1900‚Äì1903 by architect V. Bashkirov from the drawings of the artist Viktor Vasnetsov. Construction of the fa√ßade was managed by the architect A. M. Kalmykov. In early 1913, the Moscow City Duma elected Igor Grabar as a trustee of the Tretyakov Gallery. On June 3, 1918, the Tretyakov Gallery was declared owned by Russian Federated Soviet Republic and was named the State Tretyakov Gallery. Igor Grabar was again appointed director of the museum. With Grabar‚Äôs active participation in the same year, the State Museum Fund was created, which up until 1927 remained one of the most important sources of replenishment of the gallery's collection. In 1926 architect and academician A. V. Shchusev became the director of the gallery. In the following year the gallery acquired the neighboring house on Maly Tolmachevsky Lane (the house was the former home of the merchant Sokolikov). After restructuring in 1928, it housed the gallery's administration, academic departments, library, manuscripts department, and funds and graphics staffs. In 1985‚Äì1994, an administrative building was built from the design of architect A. L. Bernstein with two floors and height equal to that of the exposition halls. In 1928 serious renovations were made to the gallery to provide heating and ventilation. In 1929 electricity was installed. In 1929 the church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi was closed, and in 1932 the building was given to the gallery and became a storage facility for paintings and sculptures. Later, the church was connected to the exposition halls and a top floor was built which was specially designed for exhibiting a painting by A. A. Ivanov,The Appearance of Christ to the People (1837‚Äì1857). A transition space was built between rooms located on either side of the main staircase. This ensured the continuity of the view of exposure. The gallery began to develop a new concept of accommodating exhibits. In 1936, a new two floor building was constructed which is located on the north side of the main building ‚Äì it is known as the Schusevsky building. These halls were first used for exhibitions, and since 1940 have been included in the main route of exposure. From the first days of the Great War, the gallery's personnel began dismantling the exhibition, as well as those of other museums in Moscow, in preparation for evacuating during wartime. Paintings were rolled on wooden shafts, covered with tissue paper, placed in boxes, and sheathed with waterproof material. In the middle of the summer of 1941 a train of 17 wagons traveled from Moscow and brought the collection to Novosibirsk. The gallery was not reopened in Moscow until May 17, 1945, upon the conclusion of the Great War. In 1956, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Alexander Ivanov Hall was completed. From 1980 to 1992, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery was Y. K. Korolev. Because of the increased number of visitors, Korolev was actively engaged in expanding the area of exposition. In 1983, construction work began to expand the gallery. In 1985 the Depository, a repository of works of art and restoration workshops, was commissioned. In 1986 renovations began on the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery. The architects I. M. Vinogradsky, G. V. Astafev, B. A. Klimov and others were retained to perform this project. In 1989, on the south side of the main building, a new building was designed and constructed to house a conference hall, a computer and information center, children's studio and exhibition halls. The building was named the \\"Corps of Engineers\\", because it housed engineering systems and services. From 1986 to 1995, the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed to visitors to accommodate a major renovation project to the building. At the time, the only museum in the exhibition area of this decade was the building on the Crimean Val, 10, which in 1985 was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery.  Gallery of modern art  left Vladimir Putin and Serzh Sargsyan opening the Days of Armenian Culture in Russia at the Tretyakov Gallery. In 1985, the Tretyakov Gallery was administratively merged with a gallery of contemporary art, housed in a large modern building along the Garden Ring, immediately south of the Krymsky Bridge. The grounds of this branch of the museum contain a collection of Socialist Realism sculpture, including such highlights as Yevgeny Vuchetich's iconic statue Iron Felix (which was removed from Lubyanka Square in 1991), the Swords Into Plowshares sculpture representing a nude worker forging a plough out of a sword, and the Young Russia monument. Nearby is Zurab Tsereteli's 86-metre-tall statue of Peter the Great, one of the tallest outdoor statues in the world. Near the gallery of modern art there is a sculpture garden called \\"the graveyard of fallen monuments\\" that displays statues of former Soviet Union that were relocated. There are plans to demolish the gallery constructed in the late Soviet modernism style, though public opinion is strongly against this.House of Artists not only for Artists, Moscow Time, November 5, 2009\\"Moscow Cultural Landmark Is Seen as Threatened\\".

He previously played club football in France, England, Qatar, Denmark, Israel, Serbia, Scotland, India and Indonesia. In international competition, he represented Cameroon, having appeared for his country 34 times, including at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Club career =Nantes= Djemba-Djemba rose to prominence with Nantes in France, where he forged a successful partnership with Mathieu Berson. His impressive performances as a feisty and uncompromising tackler for the French club earned him a dream move to Manchester United for ¬£3.5 million in the summer of 2003, signed by Alex Ferguson as a possible eventual successor to the 31-year-old Roy Keane. =Manchester United= Arriving in England, Djemba-Djemba was unknown to many fans and pundits alike. He established his aggressive style on his debut against Arsenal in the FA Community Shield, with a tackle on Arsenal's Sol Campbell which Ars√®ne Wenger called \\"obscene\\". In 18 months at Old Trafford, Djemba-Djemba found it difficult to maintain a period of sustained form, and he was eventually unable to establish himself as a player capable of eventually succeeding the ageing captain Roy Keane in the centre of the United midfield. A highlight during his United career was when he scored a looping volley against Leeds United in the League Cup. With the score at 2‚Äì2 and 3 minutes of extra time left, Quinton Fortune swung in a corner which reached Djemba-Djemba, who hit it first time and it looped over Leeds goalkeeper Paul Robinson which secured a 3‚Äì2 win and progression to the next round. He scored only once more for United, in a 5‚Äì0 UEFA Champions League win over Greek side Panathinaikos. =Aston Villa= Djemba-Djemba was sold to Aston Villa in the January 2005 transfer window for a fee of ¬£1.5 million. However, the move did little to restore the player's reputation as he found it difficult to move ahead of Gavin McCann and Steven Davis in Villa's midfield. After being played only once, as a late substitute against Arsenal in the first ever game at the Emirates Stadium, by new Villa manager Martin O'Neill on the first day of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Djemba-Djemba was loaned out to Championship club Burnley for the remainder of the season in the January transfer window. Loan to Burnley  Djemba-Djemba made his first appearance for Burnley on 13 January 2007 against Southampton, playing the full 90 minutes. Early in his time at Turf Moor, he was sent off for the Lancashire side after a second bookable offence at Derby County; however he impressed with his skillful and effective play during his loan spell. During July 2007, all signs pointed to Djemba-Djemba leaving Villa Park after he was the only member of the first-team squad not to be included in the North American tour and his contract was subsequently terminated by Aston Villa. =Qatar SC= Following his departure from Aston Villa, Djemba-Djemba joined Qatar SC. He only played one season at the Qatar-based club, but managed to get his football career back on track. =Odense BK= On 16 July 2008, Djemba-Djemba signed a three-year contract with Danish outfit Odense Boldklub, the contract was later extended with a year. He previously went on a trial with the club and made his Odense debut against former club Aston Villa in the Intertoto Cup. Odense drew the match 1‚Äì1, losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. In his career in Odense, Djemba-Djemba impressed the club's fans, with his good ball skills and great performances. In his first season as an Odense player, he played good football and was by many called the league's best player. In 2009, in the 72nd minute against Esbjerg fb away, Djemba-Djemba became the first player in the Danish league to assist with his sock, as the sole of his right boot had come off, forcing him to finish the game with one boot. Later that year, Djemba-Djemba was among three other players to be nominated for the SAS Liga player of the year. In the summer of 2010, Djemba-Djemba was linked a move back to England by joining West Brom and Italian side Lecce. After traveling to England for transfer talk, the move was broken down and this led accusations against West Brom by the club and Djemba-Djemba, himself. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Djemba-Djemba's future at OB was uncertain after his contract expired. Despite expected negotiations, Djemba-Djemba instead left the club. The year before, he, along with Peter Utaka, had been told by the club's officials that their contracts would not be renewed. As a result of their contracts not being renewed, the club decided to release players sooner rather than later. =Hapoel Tel Aviv= On 14 August 2012, Djemba-Djemba signed a two-year contract with Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv. Djemba-Djemba played a total of 28 league games with the Tel Aviv-based team. =Partizan= On 24 July 2013, Djemba-Djemba signed a two-year contract with Serbian side Partizan. He made his debut in a Champions League qualifying match away to Ludogorets Razgrad on 31 July 2013, coming on as a substitute in the 64th minute.http://www.mozzartsport.com/vesti/sale-buljavi-brate-moj However, Djemba-Djemba hardly played for Partizan during the first half of the season. The club's signing of Nikola Drinƒçiƒá on 20 December meant that Djemba-Djemba became surplus to requirements and his contract was terminated on 23 December 2013. Upon joining St Mirren, Djemba-Djemba once went on three month unpaid at the club. =St Mirren= On 5 February 2014, Djemba-Djemba signed a short- term deal with Scottish Premiership club St Mirren. He said he hoped his move to St Mirren can help him gain a place in the Cameroon squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Upon joining the club, Manager Danny Lennon described Djemba-Djemba as the club's biggest signing. Djemba-Djemba made his debut for the club, in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup, as St Mirren lost 2‚Äì1 against Dundee United. After making just three appearances in all competitions, he was released by the club at the end of the season and also failed to secure a place on the Cameroon squad for the world cup. =Chennaiyin FC= In October 2014, Djemba-Djemba signed a short-term deal with Indian Super League club Chennaiyin FC. =Persebaya Bhayangkara= In February 2015, Djemba-Djemba signed for Indonesian Super League club Persebaya Bhayangkara. In 2016 Djemba-Djemba joined Swiss fifth-tier club FC Vallorbe- Ballaigues.Eric Djemba-Djemba signs for fifth division Swiss club‚Äö givemesport.com, 6 November 2016 International career Djemba-Djemba was a member of the Cameroon team that won the 2002 African Nations Cup and finished as runners-up to France at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. While in the Confederations Cup, Djemba-Djemba revealed that he was the last person to have a conversation with Marc-Vivien Fo√© before Fo√© collapsed on the pitch and later died in the hospital. He also appeared at the 2002 World Cup. However, Djemba-Djemba was not included for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, due to managerial differences. Despite his attempt to make the Cameroon squad for the 2014 World Cup, Djemba-Djemba was not included in the 28-man provisional World Cup squad and thus missing out on the World Cup under the management of Volker Finke. Personal life Djemba-Djemba was born in Douala, Cameroon. He was declared bankrupt following his move from Manchester United to Aston Villa in 2007. Djemba-Djemba was married and fathered four children before being divorced. Djemba-Djemba is a Christian.

The weave used for whipcord is a steep- angled twill, essentially the same weave as a cavalry twill or a steep gabardine. However, the ribs of whipcord are usually more pronounced than in either of those fabrics, and the weft (filling) may be visible between the ribs on the right side, which is usually not the case for gabardines. In practice, marketing considerations, rather than technical details, determine when the specific term whipcord is used. Whipcord is usually found in durable outdoor clothing (typically pants, sometimes jackets) as a 16 to 18oz (ounce per square yard fabric weight) wool, or in durable workers' clothing (typically overalls) as a 9 to 12oz cotton. In the latter case, whipcord is an alternative to duck, which has a different weave. Cord Whipcord (also \\"whipcording\\") is a form of cordage used to make whippings, secure knottings placed over the ends of ropes to keep them from fraying. Sometimes called Interlocking, it is made by plaiting together four strands to make a stronger cord, usually using bobbins to weight the strands and make them easier to control. It can be worked as a solid color or in a stripe or a diagonal for a two color pattern.Hald, Margrethe. Ancient Danish Textiles from Bogs and Burials. National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, 1980.

It was caused by displacement of a span and deformation of the rails when a tow of heavy barges collided with the rail bridge eight minutes earlier. 47 people were killed and 103 more were injured. To date, it is both the deadliest train wreck in Amtrak's history and the worst rail disaster in the United States since the 1958 Newark Bay rail accident in which 48 lives were lost. Events Immediately prior to the accident, a barge being pushed by the towboat Mauvilla (owned and operated by Warrior and Gulf Navigation of Chickasaw, Alabama) had made a wrong turn on the Mobile River and entered the Big Bayou Canot, an un-navigable channel of water crossed by a CSX Transportation rail bridge. The towboat's pilot, Willie Odom, was not properly trained on how to read his radar and so, due to very poor visibility in heavy fog and his lack of experience, did not realize he was off course. The boat also lacked a compass and a chart of the waters. Odom believed that he was still on the Mobile River and had identified the bridge in the radar as another tug boat. After the investigation, he was not found to be criminally liable for the accident. The bridge was struck by the Mauvilla at about 2:45 am. The span had been designed to rotate so it could be converted to a swing bridge by adding suitable equipment. No such conversion had ever been performed but the span had not been adequately secured against unintended movement. The collision forced the unsecured end of the bridge span approximately three feet out of alignment and severely kinked the track. At 2:53 a.m., Amtrak's Sunset Limited train, powered by three locomotives (one GE Genesis P40DC number 819 in the front and two EMD F40PHs, numbers 262 and 312) en route from Los Angeles, California to Miami, Florida with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the bridge at around and derailed at the kink. The first of its three locomotives slammed into the displaced span, causing that part of the bridge to collapse into the water beneath. The lead locomotive embedded itself nose-first into the canal bank and the other two locomotives, together with the baggage car, sleeping car and two of the six passenger cars, plunged into the water. The locomotives' fuel tanks, each of which held several thousand gallons of diesel fuel, ruptured upon impact, resulting in a massive fuel spill and a fire. Forty-seven people, 42 of whom were passengers, were killed many by drowning, others by fire/smoke inhalation. Another 103 were injured. The towboat's four crew members were not injured. Odom helped save seventeen people after the crash using the same towboat that had been pushing the barge that hit the bridge. At the time of the derailment, the lead locomotive, number 819, had been in service with Amtrak for only twenty days. Despite the displacement of the bridge, the continuously welded rails did not break. As a result, the track circuit controlling the bridge approach block signals remained closed (intact) and the nearest signal continued to display a clear (green) aspect. Had one of the rails been severed by the bridge's displacement, the track circuit would have opened, causing the approach signal to display a stop (red) aspect and the preceding signal an amber (caution) approach indication. This might have given the Amtrak engineer sufficient time to stop his train or at least reduce its speed in an effort to minimize the accident's severity. =Fatal delay= An episode of the National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster examined the accident. In addition to corroborating findings of the official accident report, the program revealed that the train had been delayed in New Orleans by repairs to an air conditioner unit and a toilet. This had put it a half-hour behind schedule. If not for this delay, the Sunset Limited would have passed over the Big Bayou Canot bridge twenty minutes before the bridge was hit by the barge.Wreck of the Sunset Limited episode of 'Seconds from Disaster', at IMDb, 10 August 2004 Aftermath As a result of its investigation of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) made a comprehensive series of recommendations, on September 19, 1994, to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Amtrak, the American Waterways Operators, Inc., the Warrior & Gulf Navigation Company, the Association of American Railroads, and the American Short Line Railroad Association.

The legends of his life are known through Beunans Meriasek, a Cornish language play known from a single surviving manuscript copy dated 1504, and a few other sources. He is the patron saint of Camborne, and according to his legendary will his feast day is the first Friday in June (although it is celebrated in some places on 7 June). Sources Until Beunans Ke (NLW MS 23849D) came to light very recently, Beunans Meriasek was the only known saint's play in Middle Cornish. It was rediscovered in the 1860s. It was most probably written down at Glasney collegiate church at Penryn, perhaps under the aegis of Master John Nans, provost of Glasney, who later moved to Camborne and died in 1508. Life Meriasek was a Breton\\"Beunans Meriasek\\", National Library of Wales from a ducal family. Conan Meriadoc, the legendary king of Brittany at the time, wanted to arrange a political marriage for him, but Meriasek preferred to renounce his inheritance and become a priest. He performed several miraculous cures thereafter. He crossed the Channel to found an oratory in Camborne, Cornwall. Encountering persecution from King Teudar, he returned to Brittany (landing at Plougasnou) to found a chapel in Josselin, in the lands of the Viscounts of Rohan. His reputation for miracles attracted crowds and he decided to withdraw to Pontivy, close to the ch√¢teau of Rohan. He assisted the Viscount in dealing with brigands who infested his lands by bringing down the fire of heaven upon them; in gratitude he founded three fairs at Noyal at the saint's request. He is reputed to have healed many lepers and disabled people, to have driven off the highwaymen of Josselin through prayer, to have made water spring from solid rock, and to have calmed a storm. He was elevated to become bishop of Vannes but continued to wear a hair shirt, practise asceticism, and minister to the poor. He was buried in Vannes Cathedral. His sacred well in Camborne was long thought to have the power of healing the insane.Doble, G. H. (1960) The Saints of Cornwall: part 1.

Whitman (September 30, 1924New York Times: \\"Manager's Profile; Martin J. Whitman\\" By Carole Gould September 05, 1993 ‚Äì April 16, 2018) was an American investment adviser and a strong critic of the direction of recent changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S. He was founder and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Third Avenue Management, and Portfolio Manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund. Early life and education Whitman was born to a Jewish familyAmerican Friends of Tel Aviv University: Whitman Family Inaugurates New Scholarship Fund for Arab-Israeli Students at TAU May 21, 2008 in the Bronx, New York.Gawker Bio: \\"Marty Whitman\\" retrieved March 26, 2018 He served in the US Navy in the Pacific during World War II. Returning to New York state, he graduated from Syracuse University with a B.S. in business administration in 1949. He held an M.A. in economics from the New School of Social Research. He worked for various investment firms in New York City before setting up his own company in 1974, M.J. Whitman & Co. His first big successful investment was his purchase of $100,000 in mortgage bonds issued by the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad. He later sold the bonds for five times his original investment. Views on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Whitman used the quarterly shareholder letters of his fund as a running critique of what he called the \\"primacy of the income account\\" (\\"primacy of the income account\\" means that corporate wealth is created only by flows, i.e., having positive earnings, and/or cash flows for a period), which he argued serves only short-term speculators rather than long-term investors. For example, in his July 31, 2004 letter , he wrote that recent developments in GAAP \\"...increasingly impose unneeded and counter-productive burdens on American corporations, American management and American capital markets. GAAP... ought to be geared toward meeting the needs and desires of creditors rather than the needs and desires of short-term stock market speculators... [T]he amount of money invested in credit instruments of all types in our economy dwarfs the amount of funds invested in equities.\\" Furthermore, \\"Most private companies, given a choice, seek to enhance [Net Asset Value] by means other than having reported operating income, which is taxable at maximum rates.\\" He argued that \\"in GAAP... material facts [should] be disclosed in a conservative, consistent, and reliable manner\\", and that \\"Financial statements [should] be prepared under the assumption that the users of such financial statements are reasonably intelligent, reasonably diligent, and are people who understand not only the uses, but also the limitations, of GAAP... [T]he most GAAP can give... are objective benchmarks which the analyst then uses as a tool to determine his, or her, version of economic truth and economic reality.\\" As an example of the difference in these perspectives, he discussed the current () controversy over whether stock options ought to be expensed using \\"fair value method\\" or \\"intrinsic value method\\" and points out that the issue of stock dilution is \\"a stockholder problem, not a company problem\\". He pointed out that to a creditor there is \\"a world of difference in the credit-worthiness of an issuer who... pays out... $200 million per annum in cash for executive compensation... [and one who] issues stock options on a non-dividend-paying common stock with a \\"fair value\\" of $200 million\\" (the point being that the latter is of almost no concern to a creditor). In particular, he cited as wrongheaded an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal of April 27, 2004, which argued that \\"financial statements exist to help investors make informed investment decisions\\". He responded, \\"That statement is just plain wrong from either a public policy point of view or a creditor's point of view. Financial statements exist to fulfill the needs and desires of many constituencies: managements, creditors, governments, customers, etc.\\" (italics in original). Economic views Although a strong advocate of capitalism, Whitman was a critic of free markets in the sense advocated by Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. For example, in a discussion of John Maynard Keynes, Friedman and Hayek, Whitman wrote that the three \\"‚Ä¶great economists‚Ä¶ missed a lot of details that are part and parcel of every value investor's daily life.\\" While calling Hayek \\"100% right\\" in his critique of the pure command economy, he wrote \\"However, in no way does it follow, as many Hayek disciples seem to believe, that government is per se bad and unproductive while the private sector is, per se good and productive. In well- run industrial economies, there is a marriage between government and the private sector, each benefiting from the other.\\" As illustrations of this, he points at \\"Japan after World War II, Singapore and the other Asian Tigers, Sweden and China today‚Ä¶ Government has a necessary role in determining how control persons [management, boards of directors, etc.] are incentivized‚Ä¶ Martin J. Whitman, Third Avenue Value Fund letter to shareholders October 31, 2005. p.3. He argued, in particular, for the value of government-provided credit and of carefully crafted tax laws.Ibid., p.4. Further, Whitman argued (explicitly against Hayek) that \\"a free market situation is probably also doomed to failure if there exist control persons who are not subject to external disciplines imposed by various forces over and above competition.\\" The lack of these disciplines, said Whitman, lead to \\"1. Very exorbitant levels of executive compensation‚Ä¶ 2. Poorly financed businesses with strong prospects for money defaults on credit instruments‚Ä¶ 3. Speculative bubbles‚Ä¶ 4. Tendency for industry competition to evolve into monopolies and oligopolies‚Ä¶ 5. Corruption.\\" For all of these he provides recent examples from the U.S. economy, which he considers to be in some respects under-regulated,Ibid., p.4. although in other respects over-regulated (he is generally opposed to Sarbanes-Oxley ).Martin J. Whitman, Third Avenue Value Fund Letters to our Shareholders July 31, 2004 (PDF), page 2. He believed that an apparently \\"free\\" relationship‚Äîthat between a corporation and its investors and creditors‚Äîis actually a blend of \\"voluntary exchanges\\" and \\"coercion\\". For example, there are \\"voluntary activities, where each individual makes his or her own decision whether to buy, sell, or hold\\" but there are also what he defined as \\"[c]oercive activities, where each individual security holder is forced to go along‚Ä¶provided that a requisite majority of other security holders so vote‚Ä¶\\" His examples of the latter included proxy voting, most merger and acquisition transactions, certain cash tender offers, and reorganization or liquidation in bankruptcy.Ibid., p.5. Whitman also states that \\"Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.\\"Martin J. Whitman, Third Avenue Value Fund letter to shareholders October 31, 2005. p.6. \\"I am one with Professor Friedman that, other things being equal, it is far preferable to conduct economic activities through voluntary exchange relying on free markets rather than through coercion. But Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.\\"Ibid., p.5-6.

It is wholly owned by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), Malaysia‚Äôs oil and gas multinational corporation. The campus is built on in the new township of Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia. The university conducts research activities in collaboration with PETRONAS and other institutions and industries, locally and abroad, on six research focus and niche areas. They are self-sustainable building, transport infrastructure, health analytics, hydrocarbon recovery, contaminant management and autonomous system. History In 1997, UTP was established in Perak, Malaysia when PETRONAS was invited by the Government of Malaysia to set up a university. Setting up a university from scratch poses formidable challenges, and the first step was taken in December 1998 with the completion of the UTP academic master plan. This acted as the basis for the physical master plan studies and registration or accreditation of degree programmes. The process of master planning was completed in 2002 and the construction of the area under consideration was completed in August 2004.http://www.akdn.org/AA54ECED-9B91-4436-A65B-F9618AB58E86/FinalDownload/DownloadId- CBBCE07A6CBF0EB9C274295D7629C22E/AA54ECED-9B91-4436-A65B-F9618AB58E86/architecture/pdf/3124_Mal.pdf UTP has produced more than 15,000 graduates and currently has an enrolment of over 1,200 foundation students, 6,000 undergraduates and 1,200 postgraduates from more than 60 countries around the world. Campus The university site is located one kilometre from the village of Tronoh, a former mining town in the Perak Tengah district of Perak, the largest state on the west coast of the peninsula. The 2 site lies within the commercial corridor between Kuala Lumpur and Penang, some from the town of Batu Gajah and from the city of Ipoh. =Academic Complex= alt= The new academic complex was designed by Foster and Partners, and the first-phase construction was completed in 2004. The design received an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2007. The overall layout of the new academic complex is in the shape of a five-pointed star made up by five semicircles. The new academic complex was officially opened by the former chairman of PETRONAS and ITPSB Board, YBhg Tun Azizan Zainul Abidin. Currently, almost all of the academic activities have been shifted to the new campus. A ‚Äòstar concept‚Äô diagram, overlaying vision, site, programme and quality, was used as a template to zone various facilities and initiate the preliminary design, An-Nur Mosque, also known as the floating mosque, was completed in 2005. The Chancellor Hall of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS is part of the academic complex that was designed by the British architectural design and engineering firm, Foster and Partners. =Sports= The university has a centralised sport facilities, commonly known as the sports complex. It consists of a swimming pool, several football fields, three futsal courts, three takraw courts, five basketball courts, five tennis courts, three volleyball courts, four squash courts, three badminton courts, a jogging track and a netball court. = Education = The foundation programmes are offered for students that enrol to UTP with SPM level or other equivalent levels to prepare them for degree programmes. Newly enrolled students with STPM level or other equivalent levels are exempted from the foundation programmes. Other newly enrolled diploma graduates are exempted from certain courses according to their academic performance and courses taken during their diploma programmes. Currently, UTP offers three foundation programmes, seven bachelor engineering degree programmes, three science degree programmes, three bachelor technology degree programmes and one bachelor business management degree programme. =Foundation programmes= The foundation programmes offered in UTP are engineering foundation programme, science foundation programme and technology foundation programme.

Biography He was born Garfield Blackman in Lengua Village, Princes Town, Trinidad, and rose to fame as \\"Lord Shorty\\" with his 1963 hit \\"Cloak and Dagger\\", subsequently taking the name Ras Shorty. A prolific musician, composer and innovator, Shorty experimented with fusing calypso and the other Indian-inspired music, including chutney music, for nearly a decade before unleashing \\"the soul of calypso,\\"...soca music. Shorty was the first to really define his music and with \\"Indrani\\" in 1973 and \\"Endless Vibrations\\" (not just the song but the entire album) in 1975, calypso music really took off in another direction. On 30 August 1977 Shorty's friend and collaborator Maestro (Cecil Hume) died in an accident in Trinidad and his loss was felt by Shorty, who penned \\"Higher World\\" as a tribute. In Dominica, Shorty had attended an Exile One performance of cadence-lypso, and collaborated with Dominica's 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo, and two calypso lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron, in the early 1970s, who wrote him some creole lyrics. Soon after Shorty released a song, \\"Ou Petit\\", with words such as \\"Ou di mwen ou piti Shorty\\" (meaning \\"you told me you are small Shorty\\"), a combination of calypso, cadence and kw√©y√≤l. Shorty's 1974 Endless Vibrations and Soul of Calypso brought soca to its peak of international fame. Soca's development as a musical genre included its fusion with calypso, cadence, and Indian musical instruments‚Äîparticularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal‚Äîas demonstrated in Lord Shorty's classic compositions \\"√èndrani\\" and \\"Shanti Om\\". His fame continued to grow throughout the 1970s, and he became one of the country's top performers. He recorded tracks such as \\"Kim\\" and \\"Money Eh No Problem\\", which was a stinging political and social commentary based on the words of Trinidad's then Prime Minister, Eric Williams of the People's National Movement. \\"Money Eh No Problem\\" was used in a political advertising campaign in 2000 for the United National Congress while Shorty lay on his deathbed unable to protest the use of his music for the wrong reasons, a guiding principle behind his life choices. In 1984, he voiced his disenchantment with soca, claiming it was being used for the wrong reasons. A short time thereafter, he embraced a strict form of Christianity, adopted the name Ras Shorty I and moved with his family to the Piparo forest in the hills of southern Trinidad, where he and his family focused on creating faith-based music. In the late 1980s, he began recording again, fusing soca and gospel in a style he called Jamoo. He continued recording into the late 1990s, writing hits such as \\"Watch Out My Children\\", which focuses on the dangers of drug abuse. The song was recorded in ten languages and was adopted by the UN in an anti-cocaine campaign. He toured transnationally with his band, the Love Circle, which consisted mainly of family members. During his lifetime Lord Shorty fathered a total of 23 children. The Love Circle included his wife Claudette and sons Eldon, Sheldon and Isaac, who have gone on to record several highly infectious hits, including \\"Blessed are the Elders\\" and \\"To The Ceiling\\". His daughters, Marge, Nehilet and Avion Blackman, also have successful careers in recording and fashion design. Artist Ataklan has also benefited under the musical training of Ras Shorty I and has gone on to become a maverick of the Rapso tradition. The family aims to put across positive messages with their music, focusing especially on youth. They also exhort modern soca artists to preach positivity and the word of God through their music. Through his daughter Abbi Blackman, Ras Shorty is the grandfather of rising star Nailah Blackman.

Expeditions  * 1st - Russian MChS (Emergency Rescue) team tried to find an object near Bodaybo. * 2nd - October, 2002 expedition of Irkutsk State University (leader S. Yazev). Official expeditions in 2002‚Äì2003 never reached the impact site, situated in remote Siberian taiga.  Kosmopoisk expedition  As reported by the ufology organization Kosmopoisk, in May 2003 an expedition, performed by Kosmopoisk (leader -- Vadim Chernobrov) reached a presumed impact point (about 50 km from Vitimsky settle point). The situation there looked similar to that of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River after the Tunguska event in 1908. Snow and water samples were analyzed and found to contain an abnormal amount of tritium, as well as radioactive isotopes of cobalt and caesium. Chernobrov suggested that the Vitim event could be caused by a low density comet nucleus with a diameter of about 30‚Äì100 meters.

He belonged to the Besud clan, part of the Taichud tribe, which was under Targudai Khiriltug's leadership at the time of Genghis Khan.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 34. Even though Jebe was originally an enemy soldier, Genghis Khan recruited him and turned him into one of his greatest generals. Jebe played an important role in helping to expand the territory of Genghis Khan's empire.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 31. Despite playing a large role as a general for Genghis Khan, there are relatively few sources or biographies about his life.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 33. Jebe has been described as \\"the greatest cavalry general in history\\" for his unorthodox and daring maneuvers.Liddell Hart, Great Captains Unveiled (1927).  Origin of name  In 1201, during the Battle of the Thirteen Sides, an arrow wounded Genghis Khan to the neck. His loyal subordinate, Jelme, cared for him. After winning the battle, he asked the defeated to reveal who shot his horse in the neck. This was an euphemism for his own injury in an attempt to conceal his injury or possibly to prevent false confessions. Zurgadai voluntarily confessed, and further added that it was Genghis Khan's choice to kill him, but if Zurgadai was allowed to live, he would serve Genghis Khan loyally.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 34. Genghis Khan valued demonstrated skills by men and their loyalty.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 32. He thus pardoned and praised Zurgadai in this account. He then gave Zurgadai a new name, Jebe, which means both \\"arrow\\" and \\"weapon\\" in Mongolian.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 34. However, in another account by Rashiduddin, an Ilkhanate administrator and historian, the event came about much differently. In this version of the event, Jebe managed to escape and was later pursued by Genghis Khan's men. Jebe managed to kill Genghis' horse before being forced to turn himself in and pleading for his life. In exchange for his life, Zuragadai promised to provide many horses for his new master in return for the one he killed with an arrow.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 34.  Commander under Genghis Khan  Jebe quickly became one of the best and most loyal commanders of Genghis Khan in later conquests, rising to one of Genghis Khan's top generals in just 3 years, and commanding the critical left army wing in the 1211 Jin invasion. His ability as a general put him on the level of Muqali and Subutai ba'atur.P.B. Golden, \\"\\"I Will Give the People Unto Thee\\": The ƒåinggisid Conquests and Their Aftermath in the Turkic World,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Third Series, 10, no. 1 (2000): 30. A Song emissary, Zhao Hong, noted that Jebe was considered to have the same level of authority as a third tier governor and held command of elite troops in Genghis Khan's army.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 33. This can be attributed to many successful military achievements while he served under Genghis Khan. = Military career =  War against Jin China  He served with distinction in the initial war against Jin China (1211-1214). During this first invasion, Jebe commanded the left wing with Subutai. His unit went around the wall to the east, capturing two fortresses. He then re- circled his tracks to destroy the second Jin army at Wusha Fortress and linked up with Genghis's main army, who later went on to win the Battle of Yehuling.Frank J. McLynn, Genghis Khan: his conquests, his empire, his legacy (Boston, MA: Da Capo Press, 2015). After this crushing victory, the Mongols took command of the passes that lead into the Beijing plains and continued to spread their control through the territory. Jebe was sent to capture numerous chains of fortresses, which he accomplished by using a feigned retreat to lure out defenders.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 35. Genghis Khan seemed to rely on Jebe as his long ranged general: in winter 1211, Jebe was sent to capture Liaoyang, when Mongol forces had barely secured the great plains around Zhongdu. After riding several hundred miles away from the main battle front, Jebe lured the defenders of Liaoyang on a feigned retreat that lasted over 100 miles and left a large amount of Mongol booty on the ground. The Chinese troops paused to plunder it, and using the long nights of the northern winter, Jebe's army rode 100 miles in 24 hours to rout the disorderly Jin forces and seize Liaoyang.McLynn, 198-199. In 1213, Genghis sent Jebe to secure the heavily defended Juyong pass. Jebe managed to find a mountain pass that enveloped the Jin fortifications, forcing the defenders to take the field. Jebe and Subutai then made forced marches the opposite way, retracing their steps and falling behind the enemy's new rear, encircling and liquidating this crucial army.McLynn, 203. After inciting a revolt in Manchuria and reducing a number of fortresses, Genghis split his army into five parts to raid vast swathes of Jin territory. Jebe was placed in the elite force under Muqali with Subutai, and they successfully raided the territory to the ocean while destroying or capturing many Jin towns and cities.  Battles against Kuchlug  In 1218, Jebe was tasked to defeat the perennial Mongol adversary Kuchlug and conquer Kara-Khitai. Given only 20,000 men, Jebe conserved manpower by inciting and backing religious revolts between the ruling Buddhists and oppressed Muslims.Chris Peers, Genghis Khan and the Mongol War Machine (Barnsley: Pen & Sword Military, 2015). His forces moved with incredible alacrity which allowed him to overwhelm Kuchlug and his 30,000 men. Kuchlug was later hunted down after a long chase through the mountains. After Jebe scored victories over Kuchlug of Kara-Khitan, Genghis Khan was said to be concerned. Although Genghis Khan was glad of his general's victory, he was unsure if Jebe would seek greater ambition and rebel against him. When word of this reached Jebe, he immediately returned to where Genghis Khan was and offered 100 white horses (the same kind that Genghis Khan rode when Jebe wounded him) as a sign of loyalty and put any doubts to rest.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 36.  Invasion of Khwarezm Empire  During the invasion of the Khwarezm Empire in 1219, Jebe was sent with a diversionary force over the Tian Shan mountains during the winter to threaten the fertile Ferghana Valley. Jebe was able to navigate the tall mountain passes that had over five feet of snow, and he drew out Shah Mohammed II's elite 50,000 man cavalry reserve force. Jebe either won a victory or at least avoided defeat against this elite force and maneuvered further south to threaten Khorasan in order to cut off the far-away provinces. He then looped back to join Genghis's main army at the capital Samarkand, effectively dividing Khwarezm into two. In order to prevent the Shah from rallying his forces in Khorasan and western Iran, Genghis Khan dispatched Jebe and Subutai to hunt the Shah throughout his own empire.Roman Hautala, \\"Latin Sources‚Äô Information about the Mongols Related to their Reconquest of Transcaucaisa,\\" Zolotoordynskoe Obozrenie no. 3 (2015): 8. Though they ultimately failed to catch him, their close pursuit prevented the Shah from rallying any new armies and the Shah was forced to flee toward Iran with Jebe and Subutai in close behind.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 36. As a result, the Khwarezmian forces were spread out and destroyed gradually.Golden, \\"\\"I Will Give the People Unto Thee\\",\\" 31.  Death  Jebe had made a legendary raid around the Caspian Sea where he and Subutai defeated the Georgians, who were set to join the fifth crusade, as well as the Caucasus Steppe tribes.Hautala, \\"Latin Sources‚Äô Information about the Mongols,\\" 8. He then later went on to defeat the Kievan Rus' and Cumans at the Battle of the Kalka River.Golden, \\"\\"I Will Give the People Unto Thee\\",\\" 31. This battle preceded the conquest of Kievan Rus' and he likely died on his return from the conquests of the Kievan Rus' in approximately 1223.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 31. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance and death are mysterious. One scholar, Stephen Pow suggests that Jebe may have been killed by the Russian allied Kipchaks forces near a kurgan close to Khortytsia Island.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 49. The discrepancy behind this information may be a result of linguistic errors since the Turkic-speaking Kipchaks referred to Jebe as Gemya-Beg.Pow, \\"The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan,\\" 41. Although the circumstances around his death is mysterious, Jebe left an indelible mark on history with his conquests in China, Central Asia, and Europe at Kiev and the Rus.

Both of the above types of cyst contain keratin, not sebum, and neither originates from sebaceous glands. Epidermoid cysts originate in the epidermis and pilar cysts originate from hair follicles. Therefore, technically speaking they are not sebaceous cysts. \\"True\\" sebaceous cysts, cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex. Medical professionals have suggested that the term sebaceous cyst be avoided since it can be misleading. In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts. Signs and symptoms Close-up of an infected sebaceous cyst located behind the ear lobe. The scalp, ears, back, face, and upper arm, are common sites of sebaceous cysts, though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They are more common in hairier areas, where in cases of long duration they could result in hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst. They are smooth to the touch, vary in size, and are generally round in shape. They are generally mobile masses that can consist of: * Fibrous tissues and fluids, * A fatty (keratinous) substance that resembles cottage cheese, in which case the cyst may be called \\"keratin cyst\\". This material has a characteristic \\"cheesy\\" or foot odor smell, * A somewhat viscous, serosanguineous fluid (containing purulent and bloody material). The nature of the contents of a sebaceous cyst, and of its surrounding capsule, differs depending on whether the cyst has ever been infected. With surgery, a cyst can usually be excised in its entirety. Poor surgical technique, or previous infection leading to scarring and tethering of the cyst to the surrounding tissue, may lead to rupture during excision and removal. A completely removed cyst will not recur, though if the patient has a predisposition to cyst formation, further cysts may develop in the same general area. Causes High levels of testosterone and the use of androgenic anabolic steroids will cause such cysts. A case has been reported of a sebaceous cyst being caused by the human botfly. Hereditary causes of sebaceous cysts include Gardner's syndrome and basal cell nevus syndrome. Types =Epidermoid cyst= =Pilar cyst= About 90% of pilar cysts occur on the scalp, with the remaining sometimes occurring on the face, trunk and extremities. Pilar cysts are significantly more common in females, and a tendency to develop these cysts is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In most cases, multiple pilar cysts appear at once. Treatment Sebaceous cysts generally do not require medical treatment. However, if they continue to grow, they may become unsightly, painful, infected, or all of the above. =Surgical= Surgical excision of a sebaceous cyst is a simple procedure to completely remove the sac and its contents. A sebaceous cyst that has been surgically removed. There are three general approaches used: traditional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision. The typical outpatient surgical procedure for cyst removal is to numb the area around the cyst with a local anaesthetic, then to use a scalpel to open the lesion with either a single cut down the center of the swelling, or an oval cut on both sides of the centerpoint. If the cyst is small, it may be lanced instead. The person performing the surgery will squeeze out the contents of the cyst, then use blunt-headed scissors or another instrument to hold the incision wide open while using fingers or forceps to try to remove the cyst wall intact. If the cyst wall can be removed in one piece, the \\"cure rate\\" is 100%. If, however, it is fragmented and cannot be entirely recovered, the operator may use curettage (scraping) to remove the remaining exposed fragments, then burn them with an electro-cauterization tool, in an effort to destroy them in place. In such cases the cyst may recur. In either case, the incision is then disinfected and, if necessary, the skin is stitched back together over it. A scar will most likely result. An infected cyst may require oral antibiotics or other treatment before or after excision. If pus has already formed then incision and drainage should be done along with avulsion of the cyst wall with proper antibiotics coverage. An approach involving incision, rather than excision, has also been proposed.

Its population is around 1,554. Polperro, through which runs the River Pol, is 7 miles (11 km) east of Fowey and 4 miles (6 km) west of the neighbouring town of Looe and west of the major city and naval port of Plymouth. It is a noted tourist destination, particularly in the summer months, for its idyllic appearance with tightly-packed ancient fishermen's houses which survive almost untouched, its quaint harbour and attractive coastline. History =Toponymy= The name Polperro derives from the Cornish Porthpyra, meaning harbour named after Pyran. However Ekwall suggests that \\"Pyra\\" or \\"Pira\\" may not be a personal name and suggests that \\"Perro\\" could be a name for the stream. Early forms are Portpira, 1303, and Porpira, 1379.Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 352 The chapel of St Peter de Porthpyre is mentioned in 1398 and the following forms are recorded from the reign of King Henry VIII: Polpyz explained as \\"fish-pool\\" (probably a literal error for Polpyr), Poulpirrhe, Poul Pier and Poulpyrre (in John Leland's account).Couch, Jonathan (1871) The History of Polperro: reprinted facsimile edition, Polperro Heritage Press; p.29 =Early history= Polperro, since medieval times, fell under the jurisdiction of two ancient and separate manors, those of Raphaelwww.nationalarchives.gov.uk in the parish of Lansallos, west of the River Pol which runs through the middle of the village, and Killigarth to the east in the parish of Talland,Couch (1871); p. 60http://www.polperro.org/walks.html mentioned in the Domesday Book. As early as the 13th century Polperro was a recognised fishing settlement and its first known record is in a Royal document of 1303. =Later history= \\"The Harbour, Polperro\\" by Edward Frederick Ertz (full-page colour plate from: \\"Britain Beautiful\\". 4 vols. London: Hutchinson, 1924‚Äì26) The date of the building of Polperro's older quay is uncertain but Jonathan Couch (writing in the mid-19th century) considered that it is either the one mentioned by John Leland or one built upon the same site. It was probably built under the patronage of the lord of the manor of Raphael who owned the harbour and its rights. Polperro's newer quay, also of unknown antiquity, is sited almost on an east-west alignment a little further out to sea. It was built before 1774 when it suffered much damage in a storm, following which Thomas Long, of Penheale and lord of the manors of Raphael and Lansallos, paid for its repair. Parts of the harbour were rebuilt after destruction by a violent storm on 19 and 20 January 1817, when thirty large boats, two seiners and many smaller boats were destroyed with many parts of the village including the Green and Peak Rock were consumed by the sea waters and a number of houses were swept away. The damage was estimated at ¬£2,000 but no lives were lost.Couch (1871); p. 34 This storm, with hurricane-force winds, caused damage to property from Plymouth to Land's End; the fishing boats at Polperro ‚Ä≥shared in the common calamity and exposed the unhappy sufferers to distress from which the industry of years can scarcely be expected to relieve them‚Ä≥.Hitchins, Fortescue (1824); Samuel Drew. ed. Cornwall From The Earliest Records and Traditions, to the Present Time. Helston: William Penaluna; Retrieved 5 October 2011 In November 1824 the worst ever storm occurred: three houses were destroyed, the whole of one pier and half the other were swept away and nearly 50 boats in the harbour were dashed to pieces. Of the six boats that survived, only one of which was a Gaffer. Polperro's new pier was designed to afford better protection for the future.Noall, Cyril (1970) The Story of Cornwall's Ports and Harbours. Truro: Tor Mark Press; p. 16 The East Indiaman Albemarle was blown ashore with a valuable cargo of diamonds, coffee, pepper, silk and indigo on 9 December 1708 near Polperro (the precise location of the wreck is yet to be discovered). Jonathan Couch was the village doctor for many years, and wrote the history of the village as well as various works of natural history (particularly on ichthyology). The History of Polperro, 1871, was published after his death by his son, Thomas Quiller Couch, with many abridgements since. Couch contributed two series of articles to the periodical Notes and Queries ‚Äì The Folklore of a Cornish Village 1855 and 1857, and these were incorporated in the History of Polperro, to which he also contributed a sketch of his father's life. The welfare of the fishermen and the prosperity of the fisheries were in his care together with his medical and scientific work.\\"Doctor By Nature\\" by Jeremy Rowett Johns; Polperro Heritage Press 2010 Polperro's beauty has long been a magnet for artists. The celebrated Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka, upon discovering Polperro, spent a year in the village between 1939 and 1940.Adamson, Donald, \\"Oskar Kokoschka at Polperro\\", The Cornish Banner, November 2009, pp. 19‚Äì33 =Smuggling= Duchy of Cornwall Smuggling is understood to have prospered since Polperro developed as a port in the 12th century.\\"The Smugglers' Banker\\" by Jeremy Rowett Johns; Polperro Heritage Press 1997 It reached its zenith in the late 18th century when Britain's wars with America and France precipitated the high taxation of many imported goods, making it worthwhile for the local fishermen to boost their income by the covert importation of spirits, tobacco and other goods from Guernsey and elsewhere. By the late 18th century, much of the success of the smuggling trade through Polperro was controlled by Zephaniah Job (1749‚Äì1822), a local merchant who became known as the 'Smugglers' Banker'. A more organised Coast Guard service was introduced in the 19th century together with the deterrent of stiff penalties, leading to much less smuggling. Part of the South West Coast Path was originally used by Revenue Officers as they patrolled the coast in search of smugglers. Whilst the South West Coast Path is maintained by the National Trust, the foreshore belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall. =Robert Jeffery= In 1807, on Commander Warwick Lake'sWinfield (2008), p.297. , Robert Jeffery, a Polperroite, was found to have stolen his midshipman's beer, and Lake, in a fit of pique, ordered him to be marooned on the island of Sombrero off Anguilla. Jeffery was born in Fowey but moved to Polperro before joining the merchant navy and then being press-ganged into the Royal Navy.Mee, Arthur (1937) Cornwall. London: Hodder & Stoughton; pp. 75‚Äì77 Some months later, Lake's commanding officer Sir Alexander Cochrane learned of what had happened and immediately ordered Lake to retrieve Jeffery. When Recruit arrived at Sombrero, Jeffery could not be found. Eventually the story got out and Lake was discharged from the Royal Navy by court martial for his actions. As it turned out, Jeffery had been rescued by an American ship and was discovered in Massachusetts three years later, working as a blacksmith; he was repatriated to Britain and awarded compensation.Derriman, James (2006) Marooned: the story of a Cornish seaman; 2nd ed. Clifton-upon-Teme: Polperro Heritage Press. (1st ed. 1991)Mee (1937); p. 76 Economy =Tourism= Tourists leaving Polperro's inner harbour on a fisherman's boat trip Tourism became Polperro's main industry during the 20th century. The village is accessible by air via Plymouth or Newquay, by train via Looe railway station, by road and by boat. It was estimated that the village received about 25,000 visitors a day during summer in the 1970s.De Burlet Portrait of Polperro; p. 36 Visitors are no longer permitted to drive cars into the village, having to leave them in the main car park at Crumplehorn to the north of the village and walk through the half-mile length of the village to its harbour. The village's quaint but narrow streets make driving difficult. There are horse and cart rides and milk floats disguised as trams for those who prefer not to walk. Attractions of Polperro include the South West Coast Path, the -long and established walk from Dorset to Somerset which passes through the village, and offers day walks along the local scenic coastline, in particular to nearby Talland Bay on the coast path heading East. Westwards, the path passes three large beaches en route to Fowey: Lansallos Beach, Lantivit Bay and Lantic Bay.www.southwestcoastpath.com Within the village is the Polperro Heritage Museum of Fishing and Smuggling, situated on the harbourside in an old fish processing warehouse, which houses interesting photographs of the village's history among other popular displays. Guided walks are available in the village, and boat trips can be taken from the harbour to view the coastline which can offer sightings of dolphins and seals. The village has several restaurants as well as seven pubs. A holiday and caravan park is situated outside the village to the northeast at Carey Park. =Fishing= The harbour viewed from the village Fishing was traditionally the principal occupation of Polperro families.Polperro Fingerprints For centuries the village has been a pilchard fishing and processing port. Fish are drawn for feeding off the South Cornwall coast in late summer bringing rich pickings for local fishermen. Once ashore, the fish were salted and pressed and the oil was collected as a by- product and used for heating and lighting. Polperro pilchards were exported throughout Europe. Shoals of these fish diminished in the 20th century and pilchard fishing died out as Polperro's mainstay in the 1960s, however approximately twelve commercial fishing vessels still operate from the harbour catching flatfish, scallops, crabs, monkfish, ray, pollock, bass and cod. Fresh fish and seafood are available for purchase at the quayside from time to time. =Festivals= Other than traditional festival days, The Polperro Festival has been held annually since 1996, being a community festival run by volunteers beginning on the 3rd Saturday in June which helps to promote business for the village. It started as an Arts and crafts Festival, and has developed to include live music of many genres, dance, street entertainment, theatre and children's entertainment. Most of the entertainment centres on Big Green, the village square, and for the last few years under a covered marquee. After 9 pm, for noise considerations, the festivities at Big Green disperse elsewhere. Notable buildings Polperro War Memorial on the Cornwall Coastal Path from Talland Couch's House in Lansallos Street was home to naturalist and physician, Jonathan Couch and before him of many generations of the Quiller family who became prosperous through the proceeds of smuggling and buccaneering.Chambers, George Mervyn Polperro, p. 7-9 Polperro's War Memorial is some distance outside the village on the coast path towards Talland. Also, tucked away in the village's winding streets (on \\"The Warren\\"), is a house clad entirely in shells, known colloquially as \\"The Shell House\\".http://www.polperro.org/pg11.html =Churches= Situated in the Anglican diocese of Truro Polperro, although a small village, is served by two Church of England parishes divided by the River Pol: Lansallos to the west and Talland to the east.

It is typically a bowl-shaped feature within which occurs a vent or vents. During volcanic eruptions, molten magma and volcanic gases rise from an underground magma chamber, through a tube-shaped conduit, until they reach the crater's vent, from where the gases escape into the atmosphere and the magma is erupted as lava. A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger depression known as a caldera. Geomorphology In most volcanoes, the crater is situated at the top of a mountain formed from the erupted volcanic deposits such as lava flows and tephra. Volcanoes that terminate in such a summit crater are usually of a conical form. Other volcanic craters may be found on the flanks of volcanoes, and these are commonly referred to as flank craters. Some volcanic craters may fill either fully or partially with rain and/or melted snow, forming a crater lake. A crater may be breached during an eruption, either by explosions or by lava, or through later erosion. Breached craters have a much lower rim on one side. Some volcanoes, such as maars, consist of a crater alone, with scarcely any mountain at all. These volcanic explosion craters are formed when magma rises through water-saturated rocks, which causes a phreatic eruption. Volcanic craters from phreatic eruptions often occur on plains away from other obvious volcanoes. Not all volcanoes form craters.

The game debuted in 1999, 10 years after the original, and incorporated 3D graphics in its gameplay. In 2000, a Sega Dreamcast version under the name Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive, which had previously purchased both Red Orb Entertainment and The Learning Company. Many of the control flaws from the original PC version were corrected and other notable bugs were fixed, improving the gameplay of this port, although it still suffers the same camera problems. This version was only released in North America. Plot Prince of Persia 3D begins with the Prince and Sultan of Persia visiting the Sultan's brother, Assan. Soon enough, the Prince's personal bodyguards are killed, himself locked in the dungeon, and the Sultan taken by Assan. The Prince escapes the dungeon, and it is revealed that the Sultan of Persia promised Assan many years ago that his daughter would marry Assan's son, Rugnor, not the Prince. The Prince finds the two, but Assan kills the Sultan by mistake while trying to kill the Prince. Assan runs, but the Prince decides to pursue Rugnor, who has taken the Princess of Persia captive. The Prince and Rugnor have many standoffs, but when it becomes clear to Rugnor that the Prince won't give up, and the Princess won't submit to him, he decides to kill her. He ties her to a large gear machine, attempting to crush her. The Prince, however, arrives before this happens, kills Rugnor, and deactivates the machine. The Prince then escapes with the Princess, via a flying beast, but the Prince takes the Princess in the opposite direction of Persia, rather than towards it. Development It was released by Red Orb, which was hived off from Br√∏derbund. However, due to financial difficulties, Red Orb was forced to release the game before it had gone through the bug detection and correction stage. Moreover, it was sold and re-sold first to Mattel, then to The Learning Company.Prince of Persia Legacy: poplegacy.com Reception John Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's not without its quirks and minor annoyances, but damn if it ain't fun.\\" Prince of Persia 3D and Arabian Nights garnered mixed reviews from critics. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 64% for the PC version, and 61% and 58 out of 100 for the Dreamcast version. IGN gave the PC version 8.2 out of 10, praising its unique score, fluid animations and well made graphics, and the jumping mechanics. GameSpot gave the same version 6 out of 10, criticizing rough character models, difficult camera effects, and unresponsive controls, but praising the action.

An epidermoid cyst or epidermal inclusion cyst is a benign cyst usually found on the skin. The cyst develops out of ectodermal tissue. Histologically, it is made of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. Signs and symptoms The epidermoid cyst may have no symptoms, or it may be painful when touched. It can release macerated keratin. In contrast to pilar cysts, epidermoid cysts are usually present on parts of the body with relatively little hair. An epidermoid cyst is one type of vaginal cyst. Although they are not malignant, there are rare cases of malignant tumors arising from an epidermoid cyst. Causes Epidermoid cysts commonly result from implantation of epidermis into the dermis, as in trauma or surgery. They can also be caused by a blocked pore adjacent to a body piercing. They are also seen in Gardner's syndrome and Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome on the head and neck. They can be infected by bacteria and form a pimple-like shape. Diagnosis Epidermoid cysts are usually diagnosed when a person notices a bump on their skin and seeks medical attention. The definitive diagnosis is made after excision by a pathologist based on microscopic appearance of a cystic lesion lined by cornified epithelium containing lamellated keratin without calcifications. They can also be seen as isointense lesions on MRI or hyperintensities on FLAIR. Treatment Cysts can be removed by excision. In case of fronto-ethmoidal epidermoid cysts, surgical resection appears to be the mainstay of treatment; however, the extent of resection is dictated by adherence of the tumor capsule to the surrounding vital structures. Hydrogen peroxide gel (H2O2) was previously recommended for cyst treatment, particularly those on body piercings. However the gel cannot adequately permeate the cyst and was not found to be effective. Hydrogen peroxide is no longer recommended for wound care by doctors as it can damage the healing tissues. On body piercings, self treatment with a hot saline soak to help drain the cyst and the use of an antibacterial or medicated talcum powder to help dry out the bump and reduce bacterial proliferation is generally recommended until medical advice can be obtained. (Use of talc is no longer recommended due to recently discovered associations with multiple cancers.) Piercings, however, are more likely to be victims of hypertrophic scarring than a cyst. Cheek piercings seem to be the piercing most prone to cysts due to the possible interruption of saliva ducts. Terminology Several synonyms exist for epidermoid cysts, including epidermal cyst, infundibular cyst, keratin cyst and epidermal inclusion cystFreedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. .James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . Epidermal inclusion cyst more specifically refers to implantation of epidermal elements into the dermis. The term infundibular cyst refers to the site of origin of the cyst: the infundibular portion of the hair follicle. The majority of epidermal inclusion cysts originate from the infundibular portion of the hair follicle, thus explaining the interchangeable, yet inaccurate, use of these two terms. Epidermoid cyst may be classified as a sebaceous cyst, although technically speaking it is not sebaceous. \\"True\\" sebaceous cysts, cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex. Medical professionals have suggested that the term sebaceous cyst be avoided since it can be misleading. In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts.

He is great devotee of Lord Shiva and goddess Parvati. He is known for his short temper. Hence, wherever he went, he was received with great reverence from humans and devas alike.Srimad Valmiki-Ramayana (With Sanskrit Text and English Translation) - Part II(9th Edition), Gita Press, Gorakhpur According to local tradition in modern Azamgarh, Durvasa's Ashram or hermitage, where many disciples used to go to study under him, was situated in the area, at the confluence of the Tons River and Majhuee rivers, north of the Phulpur Tehsil headquarters. His one famous temple called Rishi Durvasa Temple is located in village-Aali Brahman, tehsil-Hathin, dist.-Palwal, Haryana. Curses Rishi Durvasa's curses were very dangerous. He was known to have cursed devas as well as some of the notable people of the time. Some of them are: 1.Indra (Indra was cursed to lose all his powers ) 2.Shukracharya ( to forget sanjeevini mantra) 3.Lord Shiva (lord Shiva will not able to marry in his original form) 4.Goddess Saraswati ( away from brahmaloka) 5.Lord vishnu (Krishna avatar) [‚ÄúYour death is in your foot.‚Äù when Krishna was resting in forest, he was put to death due to an arrow shot into his feets.Krishna suddenly remembered the curse of Durvasa.] 6.Goddess Laxmi (Rukmini avatar) to separate from beloved husband. 7.Shakuntala ( Shakuntala avoided Durvasa while at the ashrama(hermitage) of sage Kanva this enraged him and he cursed her that her beloved will forget her about whom she was thinking i.e Dushyanta.)Kalidasa: Translations of Shakuntala and Other Works - by Arthur W. Ryder(1914)Sacontala - translated by Sir William Jones(1789) 8.Kandali (cursed to death) Birth According to Chapter-44 of the Brahmanda Purana, Brahma and Shiva once got into a heated quarrel. So violent was Shiva's rage as a result of this quarrel, that the devas fled from his presence in fear. His consort, Parvati, complained that Shiva was now impossible to live with. Realizing the disharmony his anger had caused, he decided to deposit this anger into Anasuya, the wife of sage Atri. From this portion of Shiva deposited into Anasuya, a child was born, who was named 'Durvasa' (lit. one who is difficult to live with). Because he was born of Shiva's anger, he had an irascible nature.The Vishnu Purana - translated by Horace Hayman Wilson(1840) Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana): The Story of the Fortunate One - translated by Role in The Churning of the Milky Ocean In Vishnu Purana, Vayu Purana and Padma Purana, a curse that Durvasa laid upon Indra is described as the indirect reason for the famous churning of the ocean. The Srimad Bhagavata and Agni Purana also mention Durvasa's involvement in the episode, without going into the details. Other sources for this story, such as Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Matsya Purana, do not mention Durvasa's involvement at all and ascribe the incident to other causes, such as the devas' and asuras' desire for immortality.The Vishnu Purana - translated by Horace Hayman Wilson(1840) The story in the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while wandering the earth in a state of ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. Srimad Bhagavatam - translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabupada, Copyright(c) The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and reobtain their former power so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise. In Ramayana In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa appears at Rama's doorstep and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands an audience with Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, decided it would be better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Srimad Valmiki-Ramayana (With Sanskrit Text and English Translation) - Part I(9th Edition), Gita Press, Gorakhpur Rama was filled with sorrow, for he did not want to kill his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world by drowning himself in the Sarayu river.Ramayan of Valmiki - translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith, M.A.(1870‚Äì1874) In Mahabharata In the Mahabharata, Durvasa is known for granting boons to those who pleased him, particularly when he had been served well as an honoured guest. An example of such behaviour is the episode between him and Kunti, the future wife of Pandu and the mother of the Pandavas. When Kunti was a young girl, she lived in the house of her adopted father, Kuntibhoja. Durvasa visited Kuntibhoja one day and sought his hospitality. The king entrusted the sage to his daughter's care and tasked Kunti with the responsibility of entertaining the sage and meeting all his needs during his stay with them. Kunti patiently put up with Durvasa's temper and his unreasonable requests (such as demanding food at odd hours of the night) and served the sage with great dedication. Eventually, the sage was gratified. Before departing, he rewarded Kunti by teaching her the Atharvaveda mantras, which enables a woman to invoke any god of her choice to beget children by them. Curious and skeptical, Kunti decided to test the mantra.The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa - translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli(1883‚Äì1896) After invoking Surya, the sun god, she bore her first son, Karna. Fearing the fate of an unmarried mother, she placed the newborn in a basket and set him afloat down a river. The infant Karna was later found and raised by Adhiratha, a charioteer for the monarch of Hastinapur, and his wife Radha. Soon after this episode, Kunti was married to Pandu, the king of Hastinapur, and, by invoking those same mantras taught to her by Durvasa, she bore the three eldest of Pandu's five sons. Karna would go on to become an accomplished warrior and a formidable adversary of the Pandavas. This enmity would eventually culminate in his death on the battlefield of Kurukshetra at the hands of Arjuna, his younger half-brother, who was unaware of their fraternal bond.The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa - translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli(1883‚Äì1896) Apart from his hair-trigger anger, Durvasa is also known for his extraordinary boons. According to Shiva Purana, once while bathing in a river, Durvasa's clothes were carried away by the river's currents. Seeing this, Draupadi, who was nearby, gave her own clothes to the sage. Durvasa blessed her by saying that she wouldn't lack clothes at the time of requirement & it was due to his blessing that the Kauravas were unable to strip off her clothes in the gambling hall, thus protecting her modesty.Was Draupadi Ever Disrobed? - by Pradip Bhattacharya (taken from the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. 86, 2005, printed in 2006) Another example of Durvasa's benevolent side is the incident when he granted Duryodhana a boon. During the Pandavas' exile, Durvasa and several disciples arrived at Hastinapura. Duryodhana with his maternal uncle Shakuni managed to gratify the sage. Durvasa was pleased enough to grant him a boon. Duryodhana, secretly wanting Durvasa to curse the Pandavas in anger, asked the sage to visit his cousins in the forest after Draupadi had eaten her meal, knowing that the Pandavas would then have nothing to feed him. So Durvasa and his disciples visited the Pandavas in their hermitage in the forest, as per Duryodhana's request. During this period of exile, the Pandavas would obtain their food by means of the Akshaya Patra, which would become exhausted each day once Draupadi finished her meal. Because Draupadi had already eaten by the time Durvasa arrived that day, there was no food left to serve him and the Pandavas were very anxious as to their fate should they fail to feed such a venerable sage. While Durvasa and his disciples were away bathing at the river, Draupadi prayed to Krishna for help. Krishna immediately appeared before Draupadi saying he was extremely hungry and asked her for food. Draupadi grew exasperated and said she had prayed to Krishna precisely because she had no food left to give. Krishna then told her to bring the Akshaya Patra to him. When she did, he partook of the lone grain of rice and piece of vegetable that he found stuck to the vessel and announced that he was satisfied by the \\"meal\\". This satiated the hunger of Durvasa and his disciples, as the satisfaction of Krishna (the Supreme Being who pervades the entire universe) meant the satiation of the hunger of all living things. Sage Durvasa and his disciples then quietly left after their bath, without returning to the Pandavas' hermitage, for they were afraid of facing what they thought would be the Pandavas' wrathful reaction at their impolite behaviour of refusing the food that would be served to them. In Swaminarayan Hinduism Durvasa curses Narayana According to the followers of Swaminarayan Hinduism, Narayana took birth as the saint Swaminarayan due to a curse by Durvasa. The story goes that shortly after Krishna's passing, Uddhava proceeded to Badrinath, the abode of Nara-Narayana. He joined the many divine sages and saints who were there listening to Nara-Narayana's discourses. As Nara was speaking, Durvasa arrived at the assembly from Mount Kailash, but no one noticed him because they were all so engrossed in the discourse.Swaminarayan Satsang: Portal of Swaminarayan - Under Shree Narnarayan Dev Mandir Bhuj, at He waited for one ghadi(about half an hour), for someone to welcome him with the respect he felt he was entitled to, but still no one realized he was there. Seeing no one rise to receive him, he took this as an insult and cursed the entire assembly, saying that they would all be born as humans and suffer insults and agony from the wicked. Nara- Narayana's parents, the god Dharma and goddess Bhakti, pacified Durvasa, who then softened his curse saying that Narayana himself (again, represented here as the Supreme Being) would be born as Dharma and Bhakti's son, and His birth would relieve them all from the clutches of evil. So saying, Durvasa made his way back to Kailash. Dharma and Bhakti were eventually born as Hariprasad Pande(a.k.a. Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande(a.k.a. Bhaktidevi). Narayana was born as their son, named Ghanshyam, who is now known as Swaminarayan. The story is limited to Swaminarayan Hinduism and no other Hindu scriptures support the tale.The website of The Original: Shree Swaminarayan Sampraday - Under His Holiness Acharya 1008 Shree Koshalendraprasadi Maharaj, at The website of the Shree Swaminarayan Gurukal, Rajkot, at In popular culture  In Azamgarh, a pilgrim place is named Durvasa where the temple of Durvasa is located. As per the priest of the temple, Durvasa took samadhi at this place in a shivalinga.

Their name comes from the former Central Asian Emirate of Bukhara, which once had a sizable Jewish community. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the great majority have immigrated to Israel or to the United States (especially Forest Hills, New York), while others have immigrated to Europe or Australia.Goodman, Peter. \\"Bukharian Jews find homes on Long Island\\", Newsday, September 2004. Name and language Interior of the Great Synagogue in Bukhara, sketch based on a photograph by Elkan Nathan Adler The term Bukharan was coined by European travelers who visited Central Asia around the 16th century. Since most of the Jewish community at the time lived under the Emirate of Bukhara, they came to be known as Bukharan Jews. The name by which the community called itself is \\"Isro'il\\" (Israelites). The appellative Bukharian was adopted by Bukharan Jews who moved to English-speaking countries, in an anglicisation of the Hebrew Bukhari. However, Bukharan was the term used historically by English writers, as it was for other aspects of Bukhara. Bukharan Jews used the Persian language to communicate among themselves and later developed Bukhori, a Tajik dialect of the Persian language with small linguistic traces of Hebrew. This language provided easier communication with their neighboring communities and was used for all cultural and educational life among the Jews. It was used widely until the area was \\"Russified\\" by the Russians and the dissemination of \\"religious\\" information was halted. The elderly Bukharan generation use Bukhori as their primary language but speak Russian with a slight Bukharan accent. The younger generation use Russian as their primary language, but do understand or speak Bukhori. The Bukharan Jews are Mizrahi Jews and have been introduced to and practice Sephardic Judaism. The first primary written account of Jews in Central Asia dates to the beginning of the 4th century CE. It is recalled in the Talmud by Rabbi Shmuel bar Bisna, a member of the Talmudic academy in Pumbeditha, who traveled to Margiana (present-day Merv in Turkmenistan) and feared that the wine and alcohol produced by local Jews was not kosher.Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Aboda Zara, 31b, and Rashi The presence of Jewish communities in Merv is also proven by Jewish writings on ossuaries from the 5th and 6th centuries, uncovered between 1954 and 1956.Ochildiev, D; R. Pinkhasov, I. Kalontarov. A History and Culture of the Bukharian Jews, Roshnoyi-Light, New York, 2007. History According to some ancient texts, there were Israelites that began traveling to Central Asia to work as traders during the reign of King David of Jerusalem as far back as the 10th century B.C.E. When Persian King Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BC, he encouraged the Jews he liberated to settle in his empire, which included areas of Central Asia. In the Middle Ages, the largest Jewish settlement in Central Asia was in the Emirate of Bukhara. Among Bukharan Jews, there are two ancient theories of how Jewish people settled in Central Asia. One theory is that Bukharan Jews may be descended from the Tribe of Naphtali and the Tribe of Issachar of the Ten Lost TribesEhrlich, M. Avrum.

Modern sources have described the Bukhara Jews as, for example, \\"an ethnic and linguistic group in Central Asia, claiming descent from 5th-century exiles from Persia\\".\\"Wandering Jew: Bukhara, the ancient silk way city\\", by Tanya Powell-Jones, Jerusalem Post, 1/13/2013 The Bukharan Jews are considered one of the oldest ethno-religious groups of Central Asia and over the years they have developed their own distinct culture. Throughout the years, Jews from other Eastern countries such as Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, and Morocco migrated into Central Asia (usually by taking the Silk Road). =16th to 18th centuries= Bukharan girls in Samarkand, ca 1900 Around 1620, the first synagogue was constructed at Bukhara city. This was done in contravention of the law prescribed to Caliph Omar who forbade the construction of new non- Muslim places of worship including synagogues as well as forbade the destruction of those that existed in the pre-Islamic period. There was a case when Caliph Umar had ordered the destruction of a mosque, which was built illegally on Jewish land. Before the construction of the first synagogue, Jews had shared a place in a mosque with Muslims. This mosque was called the Magoki Attoron (the \\"Mosque in pit\\"). Some say that Jews and Muslims worshipped alongside each other in the same place at the same time. Other sources insist that Jews worshipped after Muslims.Mosque and the story of Synagogue in Bukhara. \\"Bukharan Jews\\", Magoki Attoron. The construction of the first Bukhara synagogue was credited to two people: Nodir Divan-Begi, an important grandee, and an anonymous widow, who reportedly outwitted an official. During the 18th century, Bukharan Jews faced considerable discrimination and persecution. Jewish centers were closed down, the Muslims of the region usually forced conversion on the Jews, and the Bukharan Jewish population dramatically decreased to the point where they were almost extinct.\\"Bukharan Jews ‚Äì History and Cultural Relations\\", everyculture.com website. Retrieved December 13, 2009. Due to pressures to convert to Islam, persecution, and isolation from the rest of the Jewish world, the Jews of Bukhara began to lack knowledge and practice of their Jewish religion. By the middle of the 18th century, practically all Bukharan Jews lived in the Bukharan Emirate. Rabbi Yosef Maimon Bukharan Jews celebrating Sukkot, c. 1900 In 1793, Rabbi Yosef Maimon, a Sephardic Jew from Tetuan, Morocco and prominent kabbalist in Safed, traveled to Bukhara and found the local Jews in a very bad state. He decided to settle there. Maimon was disappointed to see so many Jews lacking knowledge and observance of their religious customs and Jewish law. He became a spiritual leader, aiming to educate and revive the Jewish community's observance and faith in Judaism. He changed their Persian religious tradition to Sephardic Jewish tradition. Maimon is an ancestor of Shlomo Moussaieff, author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, and the former First Lady of Iceland Dorrit Moussaieff. The borders of the Russian imperial territories of Khiva, Bukhara and Kokand in 1902‚Äì1903 Jewish students with their teacher in Samarkand, c. 1910 =19th century= In 1843 the Bukharan Jews were visited by the so- called \\"Eccentric Missionary\\", Joseph Wolff, a Jewish convert to Christianity who had set himself the broad task of finding the Lost Tribes of Israel and the narrow one of seeking two British officers who had been captured by the Emir, Nasrullah Khan. Wolff wrote prolifically of his travels, and the journals of his expeditions provide valuable information about the life and customs of the peoples he travelled amongst, including the Bukharan Jews. In 1843, for example, they collected 10,000 silver tan'ga and purchased land in Samarkand, known as Makhallai Yakhudion, close to Registon. In the middle of the 19th century, Bukharan Jews began to move to Palestine. The land on which they settled in Jerusalem was named the Bukharim quarter (Sh'hunat HaBucharim) and still exists today. In 1865, Russian troops took over Tashkent, and there was a large influx of Jews to the newly created Turkestan Region. From 1876 to 1916, Jews were free to practice Judaism. Dozens of Bukharan Jews held prestigious jobs in medicine, law, and government, and many Jews prospered. Many Bukharan Jews became successful and well-respected actors, artists, dancers, musicians, singers, film producers, and sportsmen. Several Bukharan entertainers became artists of merit and gained the title \\"People's Artist of Uzbekistan\\", \\"People's Artist of Tajikistan\\", and even (in the Soviet era) \\"People's Artist of the Soviet Union\\". Jews succeeded in the world of sport also, with several Bukharan Jews in Uzbekistan becoming renowned boxers and winning many medals for the country.Pinkhasov, Peter. \\"The History of Bukharian Jews\\", Bukharian Jewish Global Portal website, p. 2.

In Central Asia, the community attempted to preserve their traditions while displaying loyalty to the government. World War II and the Holocaust brought a lot of Ashkenazi Jewish refugees from the European regions of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe through Uzbekistan. Starting in 1972, one of the largest Bukharan Jewish emigrations in history occurred as the Jews of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan immigrated to Israel and the United States, due to looser restrictions on immigration. In the late 1980s to the early 1990s, almost all of the remaining Bukharan Jews left Central Asia for the United States, Israel, Europe, or Australia in the last mass emigration of Bukharan Jews from their resident lands. The synagogue of Bukhara in 2004 After 1991 With the disintegration of the Soviet Union and foundation of the independent Republic of Uzbekistan in 1991, some feared growth of nationalistic policies in the country. The resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan prompted an increase in the level of emigration of Jews (both Bukharan and Ashkenazi). Before the collapse of the USSR, there were 45,000 Bukharan Jews in Central Asia. Today, there are about 150,000 Bukharan Jews in Israel (mainly in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area including the neighborhoods of Tel Kabir, Shapira, Kiryat Shalom, HaTikvah and cities like Or Yehuda, Ramla, and Holon) and 60,000 in the United States (especially Queens‚Äîa borough of New York that is widely known as the \\"melting pot\\" of the United States due to its ethnic diversity)‚Äîwith smaller communities in the USA like Phoenix, South Florida, Atlanta, San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Denver. Only a few thousand still remain in Uzbekistan. About 500 live in Canada (mainly Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec). Almost no Bukharan Jews remain in Tajikistan (compared to the 1989 Jewish population of 15,000 in Tajikistan). Immigrant populations Entrance to the Dushanbe Synagogue in 2006 =Tajikistan= In early 2006, the still-active Dushanbe Synagogue in Tajikistan as well as the city's mikveh (ritual bath), kosher butcher, and Jewish schools were demolished by the government (without compensation to the community) to make room for the new Palace of Nations. After an international outcry, the government of Tajikistan announced a reversal of its decision and publicly claimed that it would permit the synagogue to be rebuilt on its current site. However, in mid-2008, the government of Tajikistan destroyed the whole synagogue and started construction of the Palace of Nations. The Dushanbe synagogue was Tajkistan's only synagogue and the community were therefore left without a centre or a place to pray. As a result, the majority of Bukharan Jews from Tajikistan living in Israel and the United States have very negative views towards the Tajik government and many have cut off all ties they had with the country. In 2009, the Tajik government reestablished the synagogue in a different location for the small Jewish community. =United States= Congregation Beth-El in Fresh Meadows, Queens, a Bukharan synagogue Currently, Bukharan Jews are mostly concentrated in the U.S. in New York City.

They have formed a tight-knit enclave in this area that was once primarily inhabited by Ashkenazi Jews (many of the Ashkenazi Jews have assimilated to wider American and American Jewish culture with each successive generation). Congregation Tifereth Israel in Corona, Queens, a synagogue founded in the early 1900s by Ashkenazi Jews, became Bukharan in the 1990s. Kew Gardens, Queens, also has a very large population of Bukharan Jews. Author Janet Malcolm has taken an interest in Bukharan Jews in the U.S., writing at length about Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson and, in Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial, about the 2007 contract murder of Daniel Malakov organized by his ex-wife Mazoltuv Borukhova. Although Bukharian Jews in Queens remain insular in some ways (living in close proximity to each other, owning and patronizing clusters of stores, and attending their own synagogue rather than other synagogues in the area), they have connections with non-Bukharians in the area. Their children, for example, usually attend local public schools do things other American children do.

Shish kabob, or shashlik, as it is often referred to in Russian, are popular, made of chicken, beef or lamb. Pulled noodles, often thrown into a hearty stew of meat and vegetables known as lagman, are similar in style to Chinese lamian, also traditionally served in a meat broth. Samsa, pastries filled with spiced meat or vegetables, are baked in a unique, hollowed out tandoor oven, and greatly resemble the preparation and shape of Indian samosas. > The Bukharians' Jewish identity was always preserved in the kitchen. \\"Even > though we were in exile from Jerusalem, we observed kashruth,\\" said Isak > Masturov, another owner of Cheburechnaya. \\"We could not go to restaurants, > so we had to learn to cook for our own community.NYT,1-18-2006 The Silk Road > Leads to Queens Plov is a very popular slow-cooked rice dish spiced with cumin and containing carrots, and in some varieties, chick peas or raisins, and often topped with beef or lamb. Another popular dish is baksh which consists of rice, beef and liver cut into small cubes, with cilantro, which adds a shade of green to the rice once it's been cooked. Most Bukharan Jewish communities still produce their traditional breads including non (lepyoshka in Russian), a circular bread with a flat center that has multiple pattern of designs, topped with black and regular sesame seeds, and the other, called non toki, bears the dry and crusty features of traditional Jewish matzah, but with a distinctly wheatier taste. After Sabbath synagogue service, Bukharin Jews often eat steamed eggs and sweet potatoes followed by a dish of fish such as carp. Next comes the main meal called oshesvo.

The Protestant population of the village attended church in the grounds of the Powerscourt Demesne until 1859. Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt built a new church, Saint Patrick's, in the village which was completed two years later, in 1861. This coincided with an extensive renovation programme that also established the Italian gardens at Powerscourt. The Viscount Powerscourt claimed the old church following the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869. The consequences were that only those with a right to be buried next to the old church within the Demesne could claim these rights thereafter. Powerscourt Estate, comprising a large house and gardens today occupying , is located near the town and is a popular visitor attraction. The extensive formal gardens form the grounds of an 18th-century Palladian house, designed by Richard Cassels, which was destroyed by fire in 1974, and lay as a shell until extensive restorations were carried out in 1996.

His electro-pneumatic switching systems advanced the technology of organ building in the first part of the 20th century. Biography Skinner was born in Clarion, Pennsylvania, in 1866, to the touring concert singers Washington and Alice Skinner. His father organized a music company in Taunton, Massachusetts, and his son attended rehearsals and performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, which stimulated his interest in music. When he was a teenager, the family moved to West Somerville, Massachusetts, where he attended high school for six months. In his autobiography, he stated that the reason for leaving his schooling was his inability to understand Latin, but Dorothy Holden in her biography The Life and Work of Ernest M. Skinner attributes it to the fact that the family fortunes declined precipitously and Ernest was obliged to assist in supporting the family. It was during this time that Ernest saw his first pipe organ and later got a job as a bellows pumper at fifteen cents per hour. He repaired his first organ at this early stage of life. He became a \\"shop boy\\" for George H. Ryder, a small organ builder located in Reading, Massachusetts. After four years he was fired, which led to his employ at the shop of preeminent Boston organ builder George Hutchings (1835-1913), first as a tuner, then rising to the post as factory superintendent during his twelve years with that firm. The 1897 Hutchings organ at the Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston drew national attention and acclaim for Hutchings, although he failed to mention his young factory superintendent, Ernest Skinner, by name. Skinner made the first of two public trips to England, crossing the Atlantic on a cattle steamer in 1898. Skinner was exposed to the work of Henry Willis, the London builder whose high-pressure chorus reeds and tuba stops set the benchmark for much of the 20th century. Skinner was given access to the large Willis organ at St George's Hall, Liverpool, and met privately with Willis, who tutored him in voicing practices and techniques not yet known in the United States. Skinner then visited France where he met Louis Vierne, the blind organist at Notre-Dame in Paris. Upon his return to Boston, Skinner made his first Pedal Trombone modeled after the work of Willis for the 1900 Hutchings organ installed at Boston Music Hall. The first documented instance of the Pitman windchest, as developed by Skinner, appeared in the 1899 Hutchings-Votey organ installed at the Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church in Brooklyn, New York, although some sources mention origins in Hutchings organs as early as 1893. In 1901, Skinner decided to strike out on his own. In 1902, he entered into a partnership to form the Skinner & Cole Company with another former Hutchings- Votey employee. By 1904 the partnership had dissolved, and the Ernest M. Skinner & Company purchased the Skinner and Cole assets. =Innovation= Skinner was one of the first organ builders to try to establish a systematic method for providing fixed dimensions in his organ consoles. Prior to this, each organ builder might use different dimensions on their consoles, causing problems with adapting to different layouts and positions of keyboards and pedalboards of different instruments, even by the same builder. Skinner worked to develop a set of universal distances between the various keyboards, determining the ideal placement of the pedal board, at a specific distance from the Great manual, as well as the placement of the various expression shoes and other mechanical devices, that have significantly contributed to the standard American Guild of Organists (AGO) Console Measurements, in use in the United States since 1930. Skinner consoles had fully adjustable combination pistons and combination actions, decades before other American firms adopted similar devices. A \\"Combination Action\\" allows an organist to pre-set and store different combinations of different stops and other controls, and to recall by pushing a button, allowing for almost instantaneous changes in the sound. The numbered rows of buttons, located between the keyboards of a Skinner instrument, access these preset combinations. Skinner is credited with the advancement of Electro-Pneumatic Actions, which control the mechanical operation of the instruments. These huge (frequently several tons) and highly sophisticated devices were built of wood, leather, and metal organ parts, and used low-voltage DC current and low-pressure pressurized air to control and direct the switching and control commands. These actions allowed the pipework of the instrument to be located in any part of a building, while the console could be located hundreds of feet away, and allowing a single organist to have control over every aspect of the instrument. Skinner developed numerous automatic Player mechanisms, which allowed an unskilled individual to operate a large pipe organ in a manner similar to a player piano. This was a lifelong interest of Skinner, and he frequently worked in secret. The Toledo Museum of Art contains a fully restored Skinner instrument that uses a Skinner Player action.Toledo Museum of Art restored Skinner Organ In 1916, Skinner created and patented the \\"Orchestrator\\", \\"Player-Relay\\" mechanism. The first of Skinner's new stops, the \\"Erz√§hler\\", appeared in 1904, and was soon joined by other tonal colors which Skinner worked on between 1908 and 1924, including Fl√ºgel Horn, and Heckelphone. In addition to his orchestral color reeds, Skinner developed numerous string and hybrid flue stops, many with matching celestes. Among these were the Salicional/Voix Celeste and Dulciana/Unda Maris present in the Swell and Choir divisions of many American organs of the era, as well as his Flauto Dolce/Flute Celeste, his Dulcet (a pair of very narrow scaled string ranks tuned with a fast beat to heighten the intensity), a pair of inverted-flare Gambas found in the solo divisions of many of his larger organs that allowed a rich, 'cello-like timbre for solo lines in the tenor range, the \\"Kleine Erz√§hler\\", a softer, brighter version of his earlier Erz√§hler (which mimics the effect of string players playing very softly), as well as his Pedal Violones at 32' and 16' pitches which he defined as \\"subtle, soft string stops\\". Skinner is known for his imitative French Horn stop, which is the only sonic creation that he patented. Ernest M. Skinner & Company built large organs for Cathedral of St. John the Divine (op. 150, 1906); Saint Luke's Episcopal Church, Evanston, Illinois (op. 327, 1922); Sage Chapel at Cornell University (op. 175, 1909); Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh (op. 180, 1910); Appleton Chapel, Harvard (op. 197, 1912); Saint Thomas Episcopal Church, New York (op. 205, 1913); Finney Chapel, Oberlin College (op. 230, 1914), Kirkpatrick Chapel at Rutgers College (Op. 255, 1916), and the Brick Presbyterian Church, New York (op. 280, 1917). In 1919, the Ernest M. Skinner & Company was reorganized with Arthur H. Marks (the former general manager and vice-president of the Goodrich Rubber Company) as the president and Skinner as vice-president of the newly organized Skinner Organ Company. This allowed Skinner to focus on technical and artistic aspects, while others would manage the commercial aspects of the company. In 1924, at the behest of Marks and William Zeuch, another principal at the factory, Skinner made his second trip to England, this time meeting with Henry Willis III, the grandson of Henry Willis (Sr.), and spending time in France with Marcel Dupr√© learning about mutation stops and chorus work of the French Romantic organ. =The fall of Skinner= The Skinner Organ Company built hundreds of pipe organs for customers all across the United States. The relationship between Skinner and the business managers of his company was rarely good, but by 1927 friction had built between Marks and Skinner. At the suggestion of English organ builder Henry Willis III, George Donald Harrison joined the Skinner staff as assistant general manager in 1927. Initially, this was accepted positively by Skinner, and collaborations between Skinner and Harrison resulted in four Landmark Organs in the late 1920s. The first was built in 1928 for the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, then two additional large organs, one for the Chapel at Princeton University, then another for Rockefeller Memorial Chapel at the University of Chicago. The final instrument was the rebuilding and expansion of the Newberry Memorial Organ, which is located in Woolsey Hall at Yale University. The Woolsey Hall organ is the largest instrument to bear the Skinner nameplate, and remains virtually unaltered. It is widely considered to be one of the finest \\"symphonic organs\\" in the world.Newberry Memorial Organ, Yale University With the onset of the Great Depression and coincident improvements in the recording and playback of electronically amplified music in larger public spaces, orders for pipe organs fell. The Skinner Company was forced to lay off workers and scale back production. The world of organ music and performance in the early 1930s had also begun to change. The orchestral style of instrument, which was the Skinner Company's specialty, had been falling from favor among many younger organists, who were looking for a more classical organ sound. Harrison, who had been working on the development of this new tonal direction for the company, was becoming more frequently requested as the designer and finisher of the limited number of available projects, while Skinner found himself being requested less. Many organists did maintain their loyalty to Skinner and requested him. The 1932 merger of the Aeolian Organ Company with the Skinner Company and the resulting change of the company name to Aeolian-Skinner,Whitney, Craig R., All the Stops: The Glorious Pipe Organ and Its American Masters, PublicAffairs, Perseus Books Group, 2004. Cf. p.65 resulted in increasing tension between Skinner, Harrison, and Marks, as Skinner saw his technical and artistic influence at the company beginning to be diminished by the ascension of Harrison. On July 14, 1933, Skinner was formally stripped of his titles and authority within the company by the Board of Directors of the Aeolian-Skinner Company, following his attempts to circumvent Harrison and influence the terms of the contract for the organ at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. The final instrument which was personally designed and finished by Skinner, though built by the Aeolian-Skinner factory, is the large organ at the Chapel of Girard College in Philadelphia (Opus 872 - 1933). It is installed in a spacious and highly resonant dedicated chamber, located above the ceiling, and above the floor of the 2,000+ seat chapel. Speaking down through a large ceiling grill and into the resonant acoustics of the chapel, even the softest voices of the instrument are clearly heard throughout the room. As pressure increased within the Aeolian-Skinner Company, Skinner began to plan the formation of a new organ company with his son, Richmond Hastings Skinner, which he planned to call the Ernest M. Skinner and Son Organ Company, with intention to compete with the Aeolian-Skinner Company. Marks was able to persuade Skinner (with the help of Skinner's wife Mabel and his son Richmond) to instead enter into a five-year contract with the Skinner Organ Company that provided Skinner with an annual salary of $5,000 in exchange for the continued use of his name, but required that Skinner and his newly purchased interest in the Methuen Organ Company would not compete with Skinner in the construction of new organs but rather \\"confine his work...\\" in the Methuen shop \\"...to the rebuilding of older pipe organs.\\" Subsequent career In January 1936, Skinner sold his interest in the Skinner Organ Company to purchase the property now known as Methuen Memorial Music Hall in Methuen, Massachusetts, including the adjacent organ factory. Both had been built by Edward Francis Searles to house and maintain the very large organ which was originally built for the Boston Music Hall in 1863. In the following years Skinner presented public performances of both choral and organ works with featured performers including Marcel Dupr√© and E. Power Biggs. Later years In 1936, Skinner, and his son Richmond Hastings Skinner, were awarded the contract for what would be his final instrument, for the Washington National Cathedral. The instrument was dedicated in the fall of 1938, to wide national acclaim. World War II and the resulting materials shortages and related financial troubles forced the company to file for bankruptcy on October 1, 1941. The Methuen Organ Shop burned to the ground on June 17, 1943. In 1949, then in his eighties and almost completely deaf, Skinner retired from organ building completely.Vitacco, Joe, \\"Ernest Skinner a great American Artist\\" Skinner was always a prolific writer, with his letters penned to the editors of The Diapason and The American Organist appearing in those publications from the 1940s onward, wherein he worked to defend his tonal ideals, and attempted to regain lost territory on the American musical landscape. As early as the mid-1930s, Skinner saw many of his instrument rebuilt or modified beyond recognition, while others were simply removed and thrown out wholesale, in the name of \\"musical progress.\\" Even three of the \\"Landmark Organs\\" mentioned in the previous section were subject to this trend, with modifications to the University of Chicago organ being carried out only a few years after its completion. Not every organist felt obliged to follow the dictates of the \\"organ reform movement\\" and any discussion of Skinner would be incomplete without mentioning his extensive, informative and influential writings on the organ and its music, published in books and national journals over most of his career. Following the death of his wife Mabel in 1951, Skinner entered a downward spiral from which he never recovered. The tonal revision of his earlier organs at St. John the Divine (op. 150, 1911), St. Thomas (op. 205, 1913) and his final large organ built for the National Cathedral all fell subject to this trend by the mid-1950s, further complicating his emotional state as he saw his life's work and ideals (and by extension, himself) gradually becoming extinct. Fortunately, in recent decades there has been a large resurgence of interest in restoring E. M. Skinner's instruments to their original condition. In many cases in which Skinner's pipework was replaced with more generic or baroque sounds, the Skinner pipework was put in storage, thus making it easier for the eventual rebuilding of his instruments to be restored back to their original tonal designs and sound. This has preserved E. M. Skinner's instruments for future generations of organists and listeners to experience his glorious instruments. The final years of Mr. Skinner's life found him living in relative obscurity in California, having far outlived most of his contemporaries. Skinner died during the night of November 26‚Äì27, 1960, at the age of 94, at the family home. He is buried in Bethel, Maine.Howe, Stanley Russell, \\"Ernest M.

It was established in the 19th century and still operates along traditional British lines. History The school was founded in 1862 by the Reverend Edward Sherman Venn. In 1872, the Colonial Chaplain Canon J.A. Beccles applied to the Government for financial aid, which was granted, so that in May 1872 St Andrew's School became a grant-in-aid institution. The growing school moved from Upper Hokkien Street to Victoria Street and then in 1875 to a four-acre site on Stamford Road.St Andrew's School History page. By the 1920s the school's enrolment had reached 800 boys. In the 1930s a system of prefects was instituted, and the school in this period became known for its boxing and Rugby. A new, larger campus was opened in Woodsville in 1940. More buildings were added in the 1950s, housing both the Junior School and the Senior School. In 1986 the secondary school moved from Woodsville to a site in Potong Pasir across the Kallang River after the Woodsville buildings were deemed inadequate for the running of both the junior and senior classes. In mid-2003, the school moved temporarily to the old Victoria School building at Kallang Bahru before returning to new buildings opposite SAJS (Junior School) in 2005 as part of the St Andrew's Village project, which brings together in one complex the Junior, Secondary and Junior College campuses. Meanwhile, the old school buildings have been conserved and strengthened for re-use as a church, winning an Honourable Mention in the UNESCO Heritage Awards in 2007. The St Andrew's Village has the first artificial rugby pitch in Singapore, shared between the secondary school and the Junior School. It opened in January 2008 at a cost of SGD 1 million and provides an all-weather surface. Academics In 2008, St Andrew's was one of eight schools in Singapore to begin offering three new subjects at GCE O Level: Creative 3D Animation, Fundamentals of Electronics, and Introduction to Enterprise Development. In 2009, St Andrew's gained an Academic Value-Added Sustained Achievement Award from the Ministry of Education. In 2010 the school was commended for including the St Andrew's River Programme in its Science curriculum. Students investigated the impact on the Kallang River eco-system and water quality of the building of the Marina Barrage and the enclosure of the Marina Basin. From 2011, St Andrew's offers enhanced enrichment courses for upper secondary students taking GCE O level in art. In 2011 the school won the Special Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in Normal Course. Sporting achievements \\"Saints\\" is one of the traditional \\"Big Three\\" rugby schools in Singapore, along with Raffles and Anglo-Chinese Independent. The School has won a total of 157 National School Titles for Rugby since the late 1960s (based on available records). It has also held the Kiwi Cup from 1945 to 2013 inclusive. It has been awarded Niche Status in rugby by the Ministry of Education. The school is also strong in hockey. The B Division Hockey Team emerged champions of the B Division Competitions in 2005, 2008 and 2018, as well as the C Division Hockey Team who emerged champions in 2010, 2012 and a recent win over Raffles Institution gave them another national title in 2014. The B Division Hockey Team also recently emerge as champions in the 2016 B Division Hockey Competitions after edging their opponents, Sengkang Secondary, in the finals with a score of 2-0. In cricket, St Andrew's were under-17 champions in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Cultural achievements St Andrew's band achieved Gold with Honours in 2005, 2009 and 2011 for the Singapore Youth Festival, and a Gold in 2007. The St Andrew's choir achieved a Silver in 2009 and Gold in 2011 for the Singapore Youth Festival and has consistently achieved the Distinctions award in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. The Drama team achieved Gold for the Singapore Youth Festival in 2007 together with a Silver in 2009, and performed for the combined Founder's Day with the Junior School and the Junior College on 25 August 2007. The school won the Sustained Achievement Award for Uniform Groups and the Value-Added Award for Academic Achievement in 2005. = Military Band = The Saint Andrew's School Military Band, previously a brass band, was renamed SASMB in 1978. The band has staged public performances at local venues such as the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Istana and the World Trade Centre (Harbour Pavilion). The band visited Hawaii in 1992, 1994 and 2000, California in 1994, Perth in 1996, Melbourne in 1998, Brisbane in 2002 and 2005, and was a guest of the California Band Director's Association in Fresno, California in 2004. The band went to Perth, Western Australia, in June 2008, and to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in March 2009 and March 2011, and Taiwan in December 2012. The band has won 10 consecutive Gold awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging of Bands from 1990 to the present. The band received the Gold with Honours award at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging of Bands in 2005, 2009, as well as in 2011. Ethos, uniform and discipline Although St Andrew's is an Anglican school, it is not a requirement for students to be Christian. The school crest includes the cross of St Andrew (the Scottish flag). The school motto is \\"Up And On\\", a phrase also incorporated in the School Song, the final words of which are \\"Up and On! Up Boys! truest fame/ Lies in high endeavour;/ Play the game! keep the flame /Burning brightly ever!\\" St Andrew's students are known as \\"Saints\\". There are five Houses: Gomes, Hose, Loyfatt, Romanis and Venn. All students wear white shirts bearing the school badge. Lower secondary boys (Sec 1 and Sec 2) must wear dark blue short trousers with white socks; Bermuda shorts are not permitted. Upper secondary boys (Sec 3, 4 and 5) now wear long trousers, although Secondary 3 students have been allowed to do so only since the 1990s. The prefects in sec 3&4 wear long white pants. The school tie is to be worn on Mondays and at special events. The school regards its system of Prefects as an important element in maintaining an ethos of service and high standards of conduct. The school's Pupil Welfare Department aims to create a sense of belonging and promote moral education and community service. Saint Andrew's maintains strict rules for behaviour inside and outside school. There is a new system of demerit points, used in combination with the school's long-standing policy of corporal punishment in the form of strokes of the cane. For 3 or 4 demerit points the penalty is Corrective Work Action or caning on the hand. Five or more demerit points mean a caning across the seat of the trousers. Students who are late to school four times in a term receive caning, and are caned again on each subsequent lateness for that term. Students caught smoking or in possession of tobacco products are referred to the Health Science Authority to be fined and counselled, as well as being caned on the buttocks. For very serious offences such as drug abuse, or a second or subsequent offence of fighting or gangsterism, the caning is delivered in front of the school body (\\"public caning\\"), otherwise it may be carried out in class, such as for a first offence of fighting or bullying. Public caning on the buttocks is also administered whenever a case is referred to the police. For a repeat serious offence the student may be publicly caned and then either suspended or expelled. After a series of bullying cases attracted attention in 2003, the school stated that the situation at St Andrew's was no worse than at any other school, adding that bullies receive a stern warning; repeat offenders or those who injure others are caned and, ultimately, expelled. An SASS student bringing pornography to school would be caned either in public or in class, depending on the seriousness of the case. For cases where the offence has a victim or where there is conflict to be resolved, a system of Restorative Practices is in place. \\"In the process of resolving the conflict, the offenders are asked to suggest the appropriate consequences for their action, which may include any form of punishment. However, any students who fail to cooperate with the teacher will be dealt with differently.\\" Logo The Saint Andrew's logo bears gold keys and a white cross. The keys refer to Saint Peter's Key, while the white cross is that of Saint Andrew. They symbolize righteousness. The tiger is a signature trademark of Saint Andrew's, signifying ferocity and endurance. The crest \\"UP AND ON\\" is the name of the school song.

The \\"inter\\" part of the term refers to the use of Inter frame prediction. This kind of prediction tries to take advantage from temporal redundancy between neighboring frames enabling higher compression rates. Inter frame prediction An inter coded frame is divided into blocks known as macroblocks. After that, instead of directly encoding the raw pixel values for each block, the encoder will try to find a block similar to the one it is encoding on a previously encoded frame, referred to as a reference frame. This process is done by a block matching algorithm. If the encoder succeeds on its search, the block could be encoded by a vector, known as motion vector, which points to the position of the matching block at the reference frame. The process of motion vector determination is called motion estimation. In most cases the encoder will succeed, but the block found is likely not an exact match to the block it is encoding. This is why the encoder will compute the differences between them. Those residual values are known as the prediction error and need to be transformed and sent to the decoder. To sum up, if the encoder succeeds in finding a matching block on a reference frame, it will obtain a motion vector pointing to the matched block and a prediction error. Using both elements, the decoder will be able to recover the raw pixels of the block. The following image shows the whole process graphically: Inter-frame prediction process. In this case, there has been an illumination change between the block at the reference frame and the block which is being encoded: this difference will be the prediction error to this block. This kind of prediction has some pros and cons: * If everything goes fine, the algorithm will be able to find a matching block with little prediction error so that, once transformed, the overall size of motion vector plus prediction error is lower than the size of a raw encoding. * If the block matching algorithm fails to find a suitable match the prediction error will be considerable. Thus the overall size of motion vector plus prediction error will be greater than the raw encoding. In this case the encoder would make an exception and send a raw encoding for that specific block. * If the matched block at the reference frame has also been encoded using Inter frame prediction, the errors made for its encoding will be propagated to the next block. If every frame was encoded using this technique, there would be no way for a decoder to synchronize to a video stream because it would be impossible to obtain the reference images. Because of these drawbacks, a reliable and time periodic reference frame must be used for this technique to be efficient and useful. That reference frame is known as Intra-frame, which is strictly intra coded, so it can always be decoded without additional information. In most designs, there are two types of inter frames: P-frames and B-frames. These two kinds of frames and the I-frames (Intra-coded pictures) usually join in a GOP (Group Of Pictures). The I-frame doesn't need additional information to be decoded and it can be used as a reliable reference. This structure also allows to achieve an I-frame periodicity, which is needed for decoder synchronization. Frame types The difference between P-frames and B-frames is the reference frame they are allowed to use. =P-frame= P-frame is the term used to define the forward Predicted pictures. The prediction is made from an earlier picture, mainly an I-frame or P-frame, so that require less coding data (‚âà50% when compared to I-frame size). The amount of data needed for doing this prediction consist of motion vectors and transform coefficients describing prediction correction. It involves the use of motion compensation. =B-frame= B-frame is the term for bidirectionally predicted pictures. This kind of prediction method occupies less coding data than P-frames generally (‚âà25% when compared to I-frame size) because the prediction is made from either an earlier frame or a later frame or both them. (B-frames can also be less efficient than P-frames under certain caseshttps://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=1228631&postcount;=12, eg: lossless encoding) Similar to P-frames, B-frames are expressed as motion vectors and transform coefficients. In order to avoid a growing propagation error, B-frames are not used as a reference to make further predictions in most encoding standards. However, in newer encoding methods (such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC), B-frames may be used as reference for better exploitation of temporal redundancyhttp://www.ramugedia.com/hierarchical-b- frames-or-b- pyramidhttps://web.archive.org/web/20141118124738/http://mewiki.project357.com/wiki/X264_Settings#b-pyramid. Typical Group Of Pictures (GOP) structure Illustration of dependencies of the group of pictures scheme IBBPBB... Time goes from left to right. The typical Group of pictures (GOP) structure is IBBPBBP... The I-frame is used to predict the first P-frame and these two frames are also used to predict the first and the second B-frames. The second P-frame is predicted also using the first I-frame. Both P-frames join together to predict the third and fourth B-frames. The scheme is shown in the next picture: This structure suggests a problem because the fourth frame (a P-frame) is needed in order to predict the second and the third (B-frames). So we need to transmit the P-frame before the B-frames and it will delay the transmission (it will be necessary to keep the P-frame). This structure has strong points: * It minimizes the problem of possible uncovered areas. * P-frames and B-frames need less data than I-frames, so less data is transmitted. But it has weak points: * It increases the complexity of the decoder, which can mean more memory needed to rearrange the frames, and a tiny bit more processing power. * B-frames may introduce decoding dependency which inevitably increases decoding latency.  H.264 Inter frame prediction improvements  The most important improvements of this technique in regard to previous H.264 standard are: *More flexible block partition *Resolution of up to ¬º pixel motion compensation *Multiple references *Enhanced Direct/Skip Macroblock = More flexible block partition = Luminance block partition of 16√ó16 (MPEG-2), 16√ó8, 8√ó16, and 8√ó8. The last case allows the division of the block into new blocks of 4√ó8, 8√ó4, or 4√ó4. 400px The frame to be coded is divided into blocks of equal size as shown in the picture above. Each block prediction will be blocks of the same size as the reference pictures, offset by a small displacement. = Resolution of up to ¬º pixel motion compensation = Pixels at half-pixel position are obtained by applying a filter of length 6. H=[1 -5 20 20 -5 1] For example: b=A - 5B + 20C + 20D - 5E + F Pixels at quarter-pixel position are obtained by bilinear interpolation. While MPEG-2 allowed a ¬Ω pixel resolution, Inter frame allows up to ¬º pixel resolution. That means that it is possible to search a block in the frame to be coded in other reference frames, or we can interpolate nonexistent pixels to find blocks that are even better suited to the current block. If motion vector is an integer number of units of samples, that means it is possible to find in reference pictures the compensated block in motion. If motion vector is not an integer, the prediction will be obtained from interpolated pixels by an interpolator filter to horizontal and vertical directions. File:Subpel interpolation.jpg = Multiple references = Multiple references to motion estimation allows finding the best reference in 2 possible buffers (List 0 to past pictures, List 1 to future pictures) which contain up to 16 frames in totalhttps://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=129364. Block prediction is done by a weighted sum of blocks from the reference picture. It allows enhanced picture quality in scenes where there are changes of plane, zoom, or when new objects are revealed. File:Multiple references.jpg = Enhanced Direct/Skip Macroblock = Skip and Direct Mode are very frequently used, especially with B-frames. They significantly reduce the number of bits to be coded. These modes are referred to when a block is coded without sending residual error or motion vectors. The encoder will only record that it is a Skip Macroblock. The decoder will deduce the motion vector of Direct/Skip Mode coded block from other blocks already decoded. There are two ways to deduce the motion: File:Direct skip.jpg ; Temporal: It uses the block motion vector from List 1 frame, located at the same position to deduce the motion vector. List 1 block uses a List 0 block as reference. ; Spatial: It predicts the movement from neighbour macroblocks in same frame. A possible criterion could be to copy the motion vector from a neighboring block. These modes are used in uniform zones of the picture where there is not much movement. File:block partition.jpg In the figure above, pink blocks are Direct/Skip Mode coded blocks. As we can see, they are used very frequently, mainly in B-frames. Additional information Although the use of the term \\"frame\\" is common in informal usage, in many cases (such as in international standards for video coding by MPEG and VCEG) a more general concept is applied by using the word \\"picture\\" rather than \\"frame\\", where a picture can either be a complete frame or a single interlaced field. Video codecs such as MPEG-2, H.264 or Ogg Theora reduce the amount of data in a stream by following key frames with one or more inter frames. These frames can typically be encoded using a lower bit rate than is needed for key frames because much of the image is ordinarily similar, so only the changing parts need to be coded.

He is known for his work of Halakha, Yam Shel Shlomo, and his Talmudic commentary Chochmat Shlomo. Luria is also referred to as ‚ÄúMaharshal‚Äù (Hebrew abbreviation: Our Teacher, Rabbi Solomon Luria), or ‚ÄúRashal‚Äù (Hebrew abbreviation: Rabbi Solomon Luria). Biography Grave of Solomon Luria (right), Old Jewish Cemetery, Lublin Luria was born in the city of Pozna≈Ñ (Posen), in the Kingdom of Poland. His father, Yechiel Luria, was the rabbi of the Lithuanian city of Slutzk and the son of the eminent Talmudist Miriam Luria. The Luria family claims descent from Rashi.For Solomon's descent and relatives see Anton Louri√©, Die Familie Louri√©. Vienna: Stern & Steiner, 1923. Luria studied in Lublin under Rabbi Shalom Shachna, and later in the Ostroh yeshiva under Kalonymus Haberkasten; he later married Lipka, daughter of Rabbi Kalonymus. Students in the yeshiva included Joshua Falk. The Maharshal served as Rabbi in Brisk and various Lithuanian communities for 15 years. When Haberkasten assumed the position of rosh yeshiva in Brisk, Luria replaced him as the official rabbi of the city and region of Ostroh. Luria later succeeded Shalom Shachna as head of the famed Lublin Yeshiva, which attracted students from all over Europe. Due to various internal problems in the yeshiva, he opened his own yeshiva. The building, known as the \\"Maharshal's shul\\", remained intact until World War II. Works Yam Shel Shlomo, Luria's major work of Halakha, was written on sixteen tractates of the Talmud; however, it is extant on only seven. In it, Maharshal analyzes key sugyot (passages) and decides between various authorities as to the practical halacha. Maharshal, famously, objected to Isserles's method of presenting halakhic rulings without discussing their derivation. He wrote Yam Shel Shlomo to \\"probe the depths of the halacha\\" and to clarify the process by which those halachot are reached. Chochmat Shlomo is a gloss, and comments, on the text of the Talmud. One function of this work is to correct textual errors. In establishing the correct text Maharshal scrutinized the published editions of the Talmud as well as the commentaries of Rashi, Tosafot, and other Rishonim. His comments were later published by his son; an abridged version of Chochmat Shlomo appears in nearly all editions of the Talmud today, at the end of each tractate. The original, separately printed version, is far more extensive, and has now been re-published in the Metivta/Oz ve-Hadar edition of the Talmud. The Chida writes that \\"I've heard from elders, that the Maharshal is extremely deep; and most hasagot (criticisms/objections) from the Maharsha on the Maharshal, aren't hasagot if the reader will delve deep into the subject\\". Maharshal also wrote: *Yeri'ot Shlomo, a super-commentary on Rashi's commentary on the Torah (in fact a commentary on Elijah Mizrachi's supercommentary on Rashi) - HebrewBooks.org; *Amudei Shlomo, a commentary on Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (\\"SeMag\\") of Rabbi Moses ben Jacob of Coucy; *A collection of Responsa; see History of Responsa: Sixteenth century.

It was based on the Douglas WB-66D airframe, with the wing-mounted engines moved to the rear fuselage and making space for air compressors. The aircraft first flew on 18 April 1963 with NASA test pilot Jack Wells at the controls.American X-Vehicles: An Inventory, June 2003. Retrieved: 13 February 2007.. Although useful testing was accomplished, the extensive maintenance of the intricate laminar-flow system caused the end of the program. Design and development Laminar-flow control is a technology that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80% of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25%. The frictional force between the air and the aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary- layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction). Two major modifications were required, the first involving the standard underwing podded Allison J71 engines being removed and replaced by a pair of static thrust General Electric XJ79-GE-13 non-afterburning turbojets mounted in pods attached to the rear of the fuselage sides. Bleed air from the J79 engines was fed into a pair of underwing fairings, each of which housed a \\"bleed-burn\\" turbine which sucked the boundary layer air out through the wing slots. The X-21A test vehicles (55-0408 and 55-0410) also incorporated sophisticated laminar flow control systems built into a completely new wing of increased span and area, with a sweep reduced from 35¬∞ to 30¬∞. The wing had a multiple series of span-wise slots (800,000 in total)Winchester 2005 p. 297. through which turbulent boundary-layer was \\"sucked in,\\" resulting in a smoother laminar flow. Theoretically, reduced drag, better fuel economy and longer range could be achieved.Baugher, Joe. Northrop X-21A Retrieved: 14 February 2007. The forward cockpit carried a pilot and two flight engineers while two additional flight test engineers were housed in a central fuselage bay underneath the wing. Testing X-21A in testing In initial testing there were significant problems with the porous materials and surface slots getting plugged with debris, bugs, and even rain. In certain conditions, ice crystals would form due to the rapid cooling of air over the laminar surfaces. This would abruptly disrupt laminar flow, causing rapid melting and rapid transition back to turbulent flow. Maximum achievement of 95 percent laminar flow over those areas was desired. However, the design effort was canceled due to the plugging problems. Nevertheless, pioneering data was obtained in the X-21 flight program, including the effects of surface irregularities, boundary-layer turbulence induced by three-dimensional span-wise flow effects in the boundary layer (referred to as span-wise contamination) and degrading environmental effects such as ice crystals in the atmosphere.Chambers, Joseph R.

Purpose One of the purposes of multimedia container formats is to allow multiple codecs to be muxed into a single file or stream. For example, to combine audio, video, and subtitles into a single file. The viewpoint held by Christopher Montgomery, creator of the Ogg format, is that the units of muxed codec data should be a separate abstraction layer from the units of data used by the codec in order to limit the amount of buffering necessary when decoding the contained data. In his opinion, which is supported by other developers working with the Xiph.org Foundation, this gives Ogg a technical advantage over alternative bitstream formats such as AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG. Each Ogg page also provides the time offset of the contained data, which allows efficient seeking that is both accurate and compatible with streaming. In contrast, many other formats seek to byte positions in the stream or rely on a table of contents for seeking information. Page structure Every Ogg page begins with the four-byte magic string \\"OggS\\". If sync is lost a decoder can look for the next occurrence of this sequence to begin decoding again. These four bytes are followed by a zero byte for Ogg version 0. The version field had originally been intended to allow multiple Ogg page types tuned for different payloads to coexist in the same stream. In the 2000s it became clear that only one page version will be used. The sixth byte of each page specifies type flags. The value 1 specifies that the page contains data of a packet continued from the previous page. The value 2 specifies that this is the first page of the stream, and the value 4 specifies that this is the last page of the stream. These values can be combined with addition or logical OR. The next 8 bytes, or 64 bits, is called the absolute granule position which is a synthetic value that encodes the Decode Timestamp, the Presentation time stamp and distance to first-needed reference. The exact encoding of the granule position is up to a specific codec. The following 4 bytes are the stream serial number to which this page belongs. Each logical stream must have a unique serial number within a physical stream. It is also intended to be used like a weak hash so that a collision is very unlikely when multiplexing different streams, which eliminates the need for continuous recalculation of page headers at every multiplexing step. The following 4 bytes are the page sequence number within the stream. This is a page counter that allows detection of lost pages. In comparison to other container formats, the large number of bits also allows direct UDP unicast/multicast with Ogg handling reordering and reassembly. The next 4 bytes, starting at the 23rd byte of the page, is the CRC checksum of the page. Because the value of this field changes, the result of the check is computed with this field equal to zero. Next, the 27th byte of each page specifies the number of segments it contains, ranging from 0 to 255. This is also the size of the following segment table in bytes. Each byte of the segment table provides the length of a segment. Each segment can be up to 255 bytes in length and is bounded by the page. A segment smaller than 255 bytes marks the end of a packet; the next segment will begin a new packet. A packet with a length that is a multiple of 255 bytes will end with a segment of length 0. If the last segment of the page is 255 bytes then the last packet is continued on the following page. Editing with pages One of the common uses of Ogg pages is to allow the editing of Ogg files without a reduction in quality or the need to transcode files. Any series of pages within a stream can be preceded by the stream's header pages (pages with an absolute granule position of 0) and be decoded properly by media players. This technique can be used to losslessly crop a media file. Multiple cropped segments can be appended to each other with a process known as chaining provided that the serial numbers of these segments are modified to unique numbers. New content can also be inserted between these segments.

Along with her husband Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Margaret Cousins and James Cousins, she founded the Irish Women's Franchise League in 1908 with the aim of obtaining women's voting rights. She was later a founding member of the Irish Women Workers' Union. Her son, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington became a politician and Irish Senator. Her sister Mary married the writer and politician Thomas Kettle. Another sister, Kathleen, married Frank Cruise O'Brien, and was the mother of Conor Cruise O'Brien. The fourth of the sisters, Margaret, married a solicitor, John Culhane, and later the poet Michael Casey. Their two brothers worked as lawyers. Early life Hanna Sheehy was born in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" McCoy and David Sheehy, an ex- Fenian and an MP for the Irish Parliamentary Party, representing South Galway. Hanna spent her earliest years on a millhouse which her father also grew up on. When Hanna was three years old the family relocated to Loughmore, Tipperary. Hanna had six siblings, one of whom died at an unknown age; there is very little written about this child. Her siblings were Margaret, born 1875; Eugene, born 1882; Richard, born 1884; Mary, born 1884; and Kathleen, born 1886. One of her uncles, Father Eugene Sheehy, was known as the Land League Priest, and his activities landed him in prison. He was also one of √âamon de Valera's teachers in Limerick. When Hanna's father became an MP in 1887, the family moved to Hollybank, Drumcondra, Dublin. The family lived next door to the Lord Mayor of Dublin and poet of \\"God Save Ireland\\", T.D. Sullivan. Hanna was sent to Germany for a short period when she was 18 years old to get treatment for tuberculosis. After graduating from the Royal University of Ireland, she worked in Paris for a time as an au pair, returning to Ireland in 1902. Hanna's brother Richard was close friends with James Joyce. Joyce wrote about the Sheehys in his acclaimed novel Ulysses, depicting Bessie as a 'social climbing matriarch', a description to which she vehemently objected. When Hanna was a teenager, the Sheehys held an open house on the second Sunday night of each month, at 2 Belvedere Place near Mountjoy Square in Dublin. They encouraged young people to visit them and their six children. James Joyce, who was a student at the nearby Belvedere College, and his younger brother Stanislaus, were regular visitors in 1896-1897. Joyce nursed a secret love for her sister Mary, the prettiest girl in the family (and later Mrs. Tom Kettle). The Sheehys were fond of singing and playing games, and would ask their guests to sing.Richard Ellman, James Joyce, Oxford University Press 1983, p. 51-52.  Education  Hanna was educated at the Dominican Convent on Eccles Street, where she was a prize-winning pupil. She then enrolled at St Mary's University College, a third-level college for women established by the Dominicans in 1893, to study modern languages (in her case, French and German). She sat for examinations at Royal University of Ireland and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899, and a Master of Arts Degree with first-class honours in 1902. This led to a career as a teacher in Eccles Street and an examiner in the Intermediate Certificate examination.Online biography of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington  Personal life  Hanna was introduced to Francis Skeffington, from County Down, by mutual friend James Joyce, who went to university with Skeffington. The couple would meet regularly in Bewley's Cafe to discuss politics, the arts and religion. Hanna married Francis Skeffington on June 3, 1903 at University Chapel in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin. The couple wore their graduation gowns as a substitute for a traditional wedding gown and suit. Both husband and wife took the surname Sheehy Skeffington as a symbol of their honour for one another. This gesture angered Dr. J.B., Francis's father, as it was seen as an act of betrayal to their family's name. The couple moved to 8 Airfield Road, Rathgar, Dublin, shortly after the ceremony. This was an area considered Pro-British at the time. Sheehy Skeffington had a son named Owen https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/granddaughter-to-recreate-sheehy- skeffington-us-tour-36017628.html. (In 2014, Owen's daughter, Dr Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, won a gender discrimination case against NUI Galway.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/there-s-nothing-wrong-with- women-we-are-more-than-capable-1.3694375)  Political life  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was born into an extremely republican family. She was influenced by James Connolly and during the 1913 lock-out worked with other suffragists in Liberty Hall, providing food for the families of the strikers. Sheehy Skeffington fought hard to get women the right to vote in Ireland, founding the IWFL in 1908 and also founding the publication \\"The Irish Citizen\\" with her husband. Her strong republican ties were also shown as she helped in the 1916 rising by delivering messages and food to the GPO. She strongly opposed participation in the First World War which broke out in August 1914, and was prevented by the British government from attending the International Congress of Women held in The Hague in April 1915. The following June her husband was imprisoned for anti-recruiting activities. He was later shot dead during the 1916 Easter Rising, after having been arrested by British soldiers. She did not find out about his death until two days had passed. Sheehy Skeffington refused compensation for her husband's death.Remembering Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, a truly independent Irish woman Irish Central, May 27, 2016 Lillian Metge, a regular Citizen reporter and suffragette friend ( who bought Hanna suitably coloured shoes at one time) wrote in sympathy and sharing her grief. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in 1916 She aligned herself with Sinn F√©in, giving them her support. In December 1916 she went to the US to talk about the fight for Irish independence and to raise awareness on behalf of Sinn F√©in, attending 250 meetings. On her return, in 1917, she became an executive of Sinn F√©in. In October 1917 she was the sole Irish representative to League for Small and Subject Nationalities where, along with several other contributors, she was accused of pro-German sympathies. She published British Militarism as I Have Known It, which was banned in the United Kingdom until after the First World War. Upon her return to Britain she was once again imprisoned, this time in Holloway prison. After her release, Sheehy Skeffington attended the 1918 Irish Race Convention in New York City and later supported the anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War. In 1920 she joined Dublin Corporation as a councillor and in 1926 she joined Fianna F√°il as an executive; however, she only kept this position for one year. During the 1930s she was assistant editor of An Phoblacht a journal of the Irish Republican Army. In January 1933 she was arrested in Newry for breaching an exclusion order banning her from Northern Ireland. At her trial she said: \\"I recognize no partition. I recognize it as no crime to be in my own country. I would be ashamed of my own name and my murdered husband's name if I did‚Ä¶ Long live the Republic!\\" and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment.Irish Freedom by Richard English (), page 343 In 1943, at the age of 66, Sheehy Skeffington stood for the D√°il as an independent candidate; however, her plans for change did not come to fruition, as she did not win the election.  Involvement in feminism  Sheehy Skeffington was a founding member of the Irish Women Workers' Union and an author whose works deeply opposed British imperialism in Ireland. Sheehy Skeffington was a close friend of trade unionist and fellow suffragette Cissie Cahalan. The Irish Women's Franchise League was formed in November 1908, with Hanna Sheehy Skeffington among its founding members, along with her husband Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Margaret Cousins and James Cousins. Although it began with only twelve founding members, the I.W.F.L grew to become one of the largest suffrage groups that existed in the early twentieth century. The I.W.F.L. was a militant organisation that focused on trying to fight issues like the lack of Irish Independence and the exclusion of women from the voting process in accordance with the Home Rule Bill and the absence of women's rights in general.Walker, L. (2004, March 27). Irish women and the First World War, part 2: The suffrage movement in Ireland. Retrieved from Unity: http://www.communistpartyofireland.ie/unity/002suffrage.html The IWFL's main goal was to ensure votes for women were included in the proposed Home Rule Bill. Meetings on a weekly basis were held in Dublin's Phoenix Park, alongside organised rallies throughout the country. According to Margaret Cousins their work was met with much hostility yet by 1912 it was estimated they had approximately 1000 members, making it Ireland's largest suffrage societyWard, Margaret. (1982). 'Suffrage First, Above All Else!' An Account of the Irish Suffrage Movement. Feminist Review, (10), 21-36. On 13 June 1912, she, along with seven other women, were arrested for smashing the glass windows of Dublin Castle. On 20 June she was convicted, along with fellow suffragettes Margaret Palmer and Jane and Margaret Murphy. They served a month long sentence in Mountjoy prison, alongside another month after they refused to pay a fine. They were granted the privileges of political prisoners.Ryan, L., & Ward, M. (2007). Irish women and the vote: Becoming citizens. County Dublin: Irish Academic Press Ltd. (p 116) In November 1913 Sheehy Skeffington attempted to present leaflets to the conservative leader, Bonar Law, and the Ulster Unionist leader, Sir Edward Carson. She was arrested after assaulting a police officer and was sent to Mountjoy yet again. She went on a hunger strike for five days until her release.Watkins, S. (2014). Ireland's suffragettes: The women who fought for the vote. Dublin: The History Press Ireland. Sheehy Skeffington was fired in 1913 from her job as a teacher at Rathmines School of Commerce for her continued involvement in feminist militancy In August 1918 she was arrested on Westmoreland Street. She was taken to Bridewell Jail and then Holloway Jail where she went on hunger strike.https://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/hanna-sheehy- skeffington-weak-but-recovering-from-hunger-strike-in-london Alongside Maud Gonne and Charlotte Despard, Sheehy Skeffington helped establish the Women's Prisoners' Defence League, to campaign and fundraise for over 7000 republicans who were imprisoned as a consequence of the Irish Civil War. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom held its annual conference in Dublin in July 1926. Sheehy Skeffington attended, along with twenty one other Irish delegates. The president of the W.I.L.F.P.F, Jane Addams praised the bravery of Francis Sheehy Skeffington, for which Hanna was grateful. Hanna also attended the conference in 1929 in Prague. In January 1933, she entered Northern Ireland to speak on behalf of the female republican prisoners being held in Armagh jail. She had been barred from entering Northern Ireland because of her political record and was subsequently arrested and held for fifteen days. In 1935 she spoke out against the Conditions of Employment Bill on behalf of the Women Graduates' Association, which was set to restrict the opportunities of employment for women. In 1937 she became a founding member of the Women's Social and Progressive League, whose goal was to inform women of the consequences of the anti-women legislation which was being attempted to pass through the Dail.  The Irish Citizen 1912‚Äì1920  The Irish Citizen was a feminist newspaper launched by Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. It was first published on 25 May 1912 as an eight-page weekly newspaper. By June 1912 it had sold 3,000 copies and was reaching up to 10,000 readers.The motto of the newspaper was, ‚ÄòFor Men and Women Equally The Rights of Citizenship; For Men and Women Equally The Duties of Citizenship‚Äô. Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins, the husbands of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins, were the first editors of the publication. Hanna, in October 1919 said that the newspaper was founded \\"to further the cause of Woman Suffrage and Feminism in Ireland... In addition it had stood for the rights of Labour, especially for the rights of women workers... we stood for the self determination of Ireland.\\" The newspaper covered topics such as Home Rule, Nationalism, and Feminism. It gave women and the suffragette movement their own voice to express their views. Lillian Metge, from Lisburn, wrote articles for the newspaper throughout the suffrage campaign and during World War One. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington took over the position of editor when her husband was shot in 1916 and remained in this role, on and off, until 1920 when the publication ceased.  Lecture tours in America 1917‚Äì1923  After the verdict in the court martial of Bowen-Colthurst referring to her husband's death, Hanna was not satisfied with the outcome and decided to bring her story to America. She spoke at over 250 meetings for nineteen months across the United States expressing 'British Militarism'.Eichacker, J. M. (2003). Irish Republican Women in America 1916-1925. Dublin 4: Irish Academic Press. Hanna first appeared on 6 January 1917 at Carnegie Hall, New York City. From then onwards, she toured the New England States and the East: Boston, where The Boston Globe describe her as \\"a wonderful woman. Her self-restraint and self- control were remarkable\\". Pittsfield, Massachusetts where The Pittsfield Daily News reported that: \\"Those present were simply amazed at the wonderful poise and self control of the speaker as she told stories perpetrated by the military authorities in Dublin that made the audience gasp with horror\\". She also addressed huge crowds in New Haven, Springfield, Westfield, Hartford, Bridgeport, Lawrence, Meriden, Torrington, Fitchburg, New Bedford, Salem, Lowell, Worcester, Malden, Holyoke and Waterbury. She also had talks at Columbia and Harvard Universities. From the 25th of February, Hanna travelled to the Midwest. She had the most successful meetings at the Orchestra Hall, Chicago with over 3,000 people which included prominent figures of Chicago. Journalists, Supreme Court Justices, clergy, labour leaders, pacifists, suffragists, newspapermen and socialists also attended her lecture tours. Hanna returned to the East on March 4 and to the Midwest on April 11. Her tours start to move westward in the spring of 1917. She travelled to California, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Montana, Butte, Pasadena and San Francisco. Hanna wanted to tour New Mexico, Nebraska, Missouri and Alaska using her contacts as she wanted to extend her tours to various cities but it came to no avail. In January 1918, Hanna received a petition from the women of Cumann na mBan. The petition \\"put forth the claim of Ireland for self- determination and appealed to President Wilson to include Ireland among the small nations for whose freedom America was fighting\\". For the rest of the upcoming months until June, Hanna returned to the Midwest and San Francisco. She also spoke in Madison Square Garden in May before leaving New York City with her son, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington on 27 June 1918, ending the first round of her lecture tours. For the second round of her lectures, she replaced Muriel MacSwiney whom was called back to Ireland by Eamon de Valera. She continued the Western section of the United States along with Kathleen Boland and Linda Kearns in 1922. They travelled to the East and the Midwest because they wanted to raise funds for relief of Irish prisoners and their families. In their speeches, they focused on the conditions in Ireland at the time of the War of Independence. During their tour which ended in May 1923, the delegation raised $123,000.

It was founded in 1899 as The Technology Review, and was re-launched without \\"The\\" in its name on April 23, 1998 under then publisher R. Bruce Journey. In September 2005, it was changed, under its then editor-in-chief and publisher, Jason Pontin, to a form resembling the historical magazine. Before the 1998 re- launch, the editor stated that \\"nothing will be left of the old magazine except the name.\\" It was therefore necessary to distinguish between the modern and the historical Technology Review. The historical magazine had been published by the MIT Alumni Association, was more closely aligned with the interests of MIT alumni, and had a more intellectual tone and much smaller public circulation. The magazine, billed from 1998 to 2005 as \\"MIT's Magazine of Innovation,\\" and from 2005 onwards as simply \\"published by MIT\\", focused on new technology and how it is commercialized; was sold to the public and targeted at senior executives, researchers, financiers, and policymakers, as well as MIT alumni. In 2011, Technology Review received an Utne Reader Independent Press Award for Best Science/Technology Coverage. History =Original magazine: 1899‚Äì1998= Technology Review was founded in 1899 under the name \\"The Technology Review\\" and relaunched in 1998 without \\"The\\" in its original name. It currently claims to be \\"the oldest technology magazine in the world.\\"However, Scientific American has been published continuously since 1845, and Popular Science since 1872. In the personal communication cited above, Pontin says that the claim rests on the definition of a magazine as being perfect-bound, Scientific American being in newspaper tabloid format in 1899. In 1899, The New York Times commented:The New York Times, January 21, 1899, page BR33 :We give a cordial welcome to No. 1 of Vol. I of The Technology Review, a Quarterly Magazine Relating to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published in Boston, and under charge of the Association of Class Secretaries. As far as make-up goes, cover, paper, typography and illustrations are in keeping with the strong characteristics of the Institution it represents. This magazine, as its editors announce, is intended to be \\"a clearing house of information and thought,\\" and, as far as the Institute of Technology is concerned, \\"to increase its power, to minimize its waste, to insure [sic] among its countless friends the most perfect co- operation.\\" The career path of James Rhyne Killian illustrates the close ties between Technology Review and the Institute. In 1926, Killian graduated from college and got his first job as assistant managing editor of Technology Review; he rose to editor-in-chief; became executive assistant to then- president Karl Taylor Compton in 1939; vice-president of MIT in 1945; and succeeded Compton as president in 1949. The May 4, 1929 issue contained an article by Dr. Norbert Wiener, then Assistant Professor of Mathematics, describing some deficiencies in a paper Albert Einstein had published earlier that year. Wiener also commented on a cardinal's critique of the Einstein theory saying: :The pretended incomprehensibility of the Einstein theory has been used as capital by professional anti-Einsteinians. Without prejudice to the cause of religion, I may remark that theological discussions have not at all times been distinguished by their character of lucidity. The historical Technology Review often published articles that were controversial, or critical of certain technologies. A 1980 issue contained an article by Jerome Wiesner attacking the Reagan administration's nuclear defense strategy. The cover of a 1983 issue stated \\"Even if the fusion program produces a reactor, no one will want it,\\" and contained an article by Lawrence M. Lidsky, associate director of MIT's Plasma Fusion Center, challenging the feasibility of fusion power (which at the time was often fancied to be just around the corner). The May 1984 issue contained an expos√© about microchip manufacturing hazards. In 1966, the magazine started using a puzzle column started in Tech Engineering News a few months earlier. Its author is Allan Gottlieb, who has now written the column for more than fifty years. Puzzle Corner‚Äôs Keeper Allan Gottlieb ‚Äô67 has been serving up math challenges to alumni and friends for half a century.by Amanda Schaffer December 22, 2015 MIT Technology Review As late as 1967, the New York Times described Technology Review as a \\"scientific journal.\\" Of its writing style, writer George V. Higgins complained: :Technology Review, according to [then-editor] Stephen Marcus... [subjects] its scientific contributors to rewrite rigors that would give fainting spells to the most obstreperous cub reporter. Marcus believes this produces readable prose on arcane subjects. I don't agree.Boston Globe, July 17, 1982. In 1984, Technology Review printed an article about a Russian scientist using ova from frozen mammoths to create a mammoth-elephant hybrid called a \\"mammontelephas.\\". Apart from being dated \\"April 1, 1984,\\" there were no obvious giveaways in the story. The Chicago Tribune News Service picked it up as a real news item, and it was printed as fact in hundreds of newspapers. The prank was presumably forgotten by 1994, when a survey of \\"opinion leaders\\" ranked Technology Review No. 1 in the nation in the \\"most credible\\" category. Contributors to the magazine also included Thomas A. Edison, Winston Churchill, and Tim Berners-Lee. =Relaunch: 1998‚Äì2005= A radical transition of the magazine occurred in 1996. At that time, according to the Boston Business Journal, in 1996 Technology Review had lost $1.6 million over the previous seven years and was \\"facing the possibility of folding\\" due to \\"years of declining advertising revenue.\\" R. Bruce Journey was named publisher, the first full-time publisher in the magazine's history. According to previous publisher William J. Hecht, although Technology Review had \\"long been highly regarded for its editorial excellence,\\" the purpose of appointing Journey was to enhance its \\"commercial potential\\" and \\"secure a prominent place for Technology Review in the competitive world of commercial publishing.\\"Boston Globe, April 25, 1999 p. G1 John Benditt replaced Steven J. Marcus as editor- in-chief, the entire editorial staff was fired, and the modern Technology Review was born. Boston Globe columnist David WarshBoston Globe, April 21, 1998 p. C1 \\"Gloom, Doom and Boom at MIT.\\" Warsh analogized the old TR with beloved departed Cambridge eateries like the F&T; Deli. described the transition by saying that the magazine had been serving up \\"old 1960s views of things: humanist, populist, ruminative, suspicious of the unseen dimensions of new technologies\\" and had now been replaced with one that \\"takes innovation seriously and enthusiastically.\\" Former editor Marcus characterized the magazine's new stance as \\"cheerleading for innovation.\\" Under Bruce Journey, Technology Review billed itself as \\"MIT's Magazine of Innovation.\\" Since 2001, it has been published by Technology Review Inc., a nonprofit independent media company owned by MIT. Intending to appeal to business leaders, editor John Benditt said in 1999, \\"We're really about new technologies and how they get commercialized.\\" Technology Review covers breakthroughs and current issues on fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and computing. Articles are also devoted to more mature disciplines such as energy, telecommunications, transportation, and the military. Since Journey, Technology Review has been distributed as a regular mass-market magazine and appears on newsstands. By 2003, circulation had more than tripled from 92,000 to 315,000, about half that of Scientific American, and included 220,000 paid subscribers and 95,000 sent free to MIT alumni. Additionally, in August 2003, a German edition of Technology Review was started in cooperation with the publishing house Heinz Heise (circulation of about 50,000 as of 2005). According to The New York Times,The New York Times, November 10, 2004, p. 8, \\"Glossy Alumni Magazines Seek More Than Graduates\\" as of 2004 the magazine was still \\"partly financed by M.I.T. (though it is expected to turn a profit eventually).\\" Technology Review also functions as the MIT alumni magazine; the edition sent to alumni contains a separate section, \\"MIT News,\\" containing items such as alumni class notes. This section is not included in the edition distributed to the general public. The magazine is published by Technology Review, Inc, an independent media company owned by MIT. MIT's website lists it as an MIT publication, and the MIT News Office states that \\"the magazine often uses MIT expertise for some of its content.\\" In 1999 The Boston Globe noted that (apart from the alumni section) \\"few Technology Review articles actually concern events or research at MIT.\\"Boston Globe, April 25, 1999 p. G1 \\"MIT Tech Magazine, On Plateau, Finds Killer App: Commercialism\\" However, in the words of editor Jason Pontin: :Our job is not to promote MIT; but we analyse and explain emerging technologies, and because we believe that new technologies are, generally speaking, a good thing, we do indirectly promote MIT's core activity: that is, the development of innovative technology.Jason Pontin, personal email to Dpbsmith, August 27, 2005 From 1997 to 2005, R. Bruce Journey held the title of \\"publisher\\"; Journey was also the president and CEO of Technology Review, Inc. Editors-in-chief have included John Benditt (1997), Robert Buderi (2002), and Jason Pontin (2004). The magazine has won numerous Folio! awards, presented at the annual magazine publishing trade show conducted by Folio! magazine. In 2001, these included a \\"Silver Folio: Editorial Excellence Award\\" in the consumer science and technology magazine category and many awards for typography and design. In 2006, Technology Review was named a finalist in the \\"general excellence\\" category of the annual National Magazine Awards, sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors. On June 6, 2001, Fortune and CNET Networks launched a publication entitled Fortune/CNET Technology Review. MIT sued FORTUNE's parent corporation, Time, Inc. for infringement of the Technology Review trademark.Trademark registration 0668713, registered October 21, 1958 to \\"Alumni Association of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\" and renewed in 1999. The case was quickly settled. In August the MIT student newspaper reported that lawyers for MIT and Time were reluctant to discuss the case, citing a confidentiality agreement that both sides described as very restrictive. Jason Kravitz, a Boston attorney who represented MIT in the case, suggested that the magazine‚Äôs change of name to Fortune/CNET Tech Review, a change that occurred in the middle of the case, may have been part of the settlement. Many publications covering specific technologies have used \\"technology review\\" as part of their names, such as Lawrence Livermore Labs's Energy & Technology Review, AACE's Educational Technology Review, and the International Atomic Energy Agency's Nuclear Technology Review. In 2005, Technology Review, along with Wired News and other technology publications, was embarrassed by the publication of a number of stories by freelancer Michelle Delio containing information which could not be corroborated. Editor- in-chief Pontin said, \\"Of the ten stories which were published, only three were entirely accurate. In two of the stories, I'm fairly confident that Michelle Delio either did not speak to the person she said she spoke to, or misrepresented her interview with him.\\" The stories were retracted. =Modern magazine: 2005-present= On August 30, 2005, Technology Review announced that R. Bruce Journey, publisher from 1996 to 2005, would be replaced by the then current Editor in Chief, Jason Pontin, and would reduce the print publication frequency from eleven to six issues per year while enhancing the publication's website.Boston Globe, April 22, 2005, p. C3 \\"More of Writer's Stories Faulted‚ÄîMIT Says Just 3 of 10 were Accurate\\" The Boston Globe characterized the change as a \\"strategic overhaul.\\" Editor and publisher Jason Pontin stated that he would \\"focus the print magazine on what print does best: present[ing] longer-format, investigative stories and colorful imagery.\\" Technology Review's Web site, Pontin said, would henceforth publish original, daily news and analysis (whereas before it had merely republished the print magazine's stories). Finally, Pontin said that Technology Review's stories in print and online would identify and analyze emerging technologies. This focus resembles that of the historical Technology Review. Pontin convinced copy editors to adopt the diaeresis mark for words like \\"co√∂rdinate\\", a rarity in native English usage, though failed to convince them to use logical punctuation. (original comment on before comments were disabled) Without evident comment, the July/August, 2017, issue revealed a shift in top personnel, with Elizabeth Bramson-Boudreau listed as Chief Executive Officer and Publisher, and David Rotman as Editor. Gideon Lichfield was named editor-in-chief in November, 2017. Every year, the magazine publishes a list of the 10 technologies it considers the most influential.  Annual lists  Each year, MIT Technology Review publishes three annual lists: * Innovators Under 35 (formerly TR35) * 10 Breakthrough Technologies * 50 Smartest Companies = Innovators Under 35 = MIT Technology Review has become well known for its annual Innovators Under 35. In 1999, and then in 2002‚Äî2004, MIT Technology Review produced the TR100, a list of \\"100 remarkable innovators under the age of 35.\\" In 2005, this list was renamed the TR35 and shortened to 35 individuals under the age of 35. Notable recipients of the award include Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Geekcorps creator Ethan Zuckerman, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, BitTorrent developer Bram Cohen, MacArthur \\"genius\\" bioengineer Jim Collins, investor Micah Siegel and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. The list was renamed Innovators Under 35 in 2013. Recognition In 2006, Technology Review was a finalist in the National Magazine Awards in the category of General Excellence. In 2010, Technology Review won the gold and silver prizes for best full issue of a technology magazine (for its November and June 2009 issues) and the gold, silver, and bronze prizes for best single article in a technology magazine (for ‚ÄúNatural Gas Changes the Energy Map‚Äù by David Rotman; ‚ÄúPrescription: Networking‚Äù by David Talbot; and ‚ÄúChasing the Sun‚Äú by David Rotman) in the Folio Magazine Eddie Awards.

Incumbent President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski was easily re-elected in the first round with more than 50% of the vote. Background President Kwa≈õniewski was seen as very likely to win re-election in the run up to the presidential election with polls showing that his popularity was high as 70% support. His main challenger was expected to be Marian Krzaklewski from the Solidarity Electoral Action, which had formed the government since winning the last parliamentary elections in 1997. The other main candidate was a former Foreign Minister and more liberal conservative Andrzej Olechowski, who won support from voters who were discontented with both of the other main candidates and in particular younger voters, businessmen and intellectuals. Candidates seen as having less of a chance included Andrzej Lepper, a populist farmers leader who opposed entry into the European Union and former president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. Wa≈Çƒôsa was rejected as the candidate for the Solidarity party he had won the presidency for, and thus ran separately in the election. In order to be elected in the first round a candidate had to gain over 50% of the vote. If no candidate reached this level, then a second round would have been held between the top two candidates. As the campaign continued, the biggest question in the election was whether or not incumbent President Kwa≈õniewski would win the 50% required to avoid a second round. In the August before the election Kwa≈õniewski and another former president and candidate Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa were investigated by a court on allegations that they had been informers for the Communist secret police. If they had been found guilty they could have been banned from seeking election to political office for 10 years. However they both claimed that the evidence had been manipulated by political opponents and were cleared by the court. Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski attacked Kwa≈õniewski for his past as a Communist party activist. However opinion polls in August showed this had little effect with Kwa≈õniewski well ahead with over 60% support, while Krzaklewski was second and Olechowski third, but both a long way behind. President Kwa≈õniewski's campaign focused on reconciling all of Poland with slogans including \\"Poland, our common home\\". Most voters felt he had done well as President and he was seen as having done a good job in guiding Poland to membership of NATO. Krzaklewski's popularity was not high due to the infighting in the government led by his Solidarity party since they had won the 1997 parliamentary election. Meanwhile, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa trailed badly in the polls with only about 2% support, which Wa≈Çƒôsa saw as being due to voters seeing him as being responsible for the pain involved in the transition from communism. In the election 3 candidates ran on platforms against the European Union. During the campaign one of them, Andrzej Lepper, was arrested for illegally blocking a customs post, however he claimed that this was an attempt to sabotage his campaign. As the election neared Kwa≈õniewski dropped in the polls and it became uncertain whether he would win the 50% required to avoid a second round. This followed a television advertisement from Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski in which Kwa≈õniewski was accused of having mocked Pope John Paul II. The video showed Kwa≈õniewski apparently urging his security advisor to kiss the ground is a parody of the Pope, although Kwa≈õniewski claimed this was inaccurate. At least one poll showed Kwa≈õniewski's support having dropped by 10% in one week following this, however it was the other main candidate, Andrzej Olechowski, who benefited as Krzaklewski was seen as being tarnished for having run a negative campaign. Candidates There was no second round since Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski got over 50% in the first round.

The nephew of a diplomat, he himself became a diplomat by the age of thirty, and came to know both Emperor Charles V and King Francis of France, and he negotiated with both on behalf of the pope. His uncle, Alberto Pio da Carpi, had been educated by Pico della Mirandola, and had become a noted humanist scholar. These associations formed Rodolfo's background and education. He formed a notable library and participated in the humanist studies of 16th-century Rome, even though he served on the Roman Inquisition. His colleagues as supremi giudici nel Tribunale del Sancto Officio were: Cardinals Giovanni Pietro Carafa (Pope Paul IV, 1555-1559), Marcello Cervini (Pope Marcellus II, 1555), and F. Giovanni of Toledo. He helped to establish the Inquisition at Milan. Biography =Family= The Lords of Carpi first made a position for themselves in the 14th century. From the house of Este they received the lordship of Carpi, and in 1518, through the influence of Pope Leo X, they acquired the subsidiary fiefs of Meldola and Sassuolo, with which Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was invested. Many members of the family continued in the family tradition as condottieri: Alberto Pio obtained from the house of Savoy in 1450 the privilege of adding \\"di Savoia\\" to his name, as a reward for his military services. Others besides Cardinal Carpi made careers in diplomacy: Alberto Pio (1475-1531) who was Imperial ambassador in RomeHe had taken refuge in France after the Sack of Rome, but from 1527 to 1529 was the major intermediary between the French Court and the Papal Court: Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxiii. won fame as a man of learning. Ascanio Pio (d. 1649) was a dramatic poet. Spain conferred the title of prince on the family, and one branch of the family is to this day established in Spain. =Education and early career= Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was born in Carpi near Modena, where his uncle Alberto (c. 1475-1531) was lord of Carpi. His father was Lionello da Carpi and his mother was Maria Martinengo. In 1516 he was a Chevalier of the Knights of S. John of Jerusalem and Commendatory of the church of S. Lorenzo di Colorno in the diocese of Parma. Pope Leo X granted him the church of the Holy Trinity in Ferrara, clearly as a favor to his uncle rather than an acknowledgment of his own achievements. Rodolfo was sent to study at the University of Padua, where he became Doctor of Philosophy,Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxiii. and at Rome, where he took up an ecclesiastical career as a Papal Chamberlain under Pope Clement VII, who made him bishop of Faenza in 1528. There Carpi presided over a synod in 1533. He was absent, however, during most of the sixteen years of his episcopate, and therefore the duties of his office were performed by his brother Teodoro and by Segicellus of Faventia. Giovanni Battista Sighiselli was Bishop Teodoro Pio da Carpi's successor as Bishop of Faenza: Gulik and Eubel, p. 194. Carpi's first mission to France took place between 26 July and 28 November 1530.Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxiii, points out that under Paul III there were at least 26 extraordinary envoys to France. He was back in France as a special envoy in the summer of 1533, charged with arranging a personal meeting between Francis I and Pope Clement VII. He was received by Francis at Lyon on 11 June. The Pope wanted to meet at Nice, but eventually the meeting took place in Marseille, where the marriage of Henri II and Catherine de' Medici was solemnized, and where Pope Clement was able to engage in negotiations with both Francis I and Charles V.Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxiii-xxxiv. Carpi attracted further notice in papal diplomacy when he was established as papal nuncio at the court of Fran√ßois I (1535 - 1537). His commission was dated 9 January 1535; he joined the Court at Saint-Germain on 17 February.Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxiv. There he negotiated a peace between King Francis and the Emperor Charles V, who was pleased enough to appoint him \\"protector of the Holy Roman Empire\\". While Carpi was in France in 1533, there were rumors being spread around Rome, suggesting that Carpi was furnishing information to the Imperialists. Carpi was advised about these rumors by Pope Paul's secretary, Ambrogio Ricalcato, who also indicated that they were being circulated by agents of the Cardinal de Lorraine. Evidently King Francis heard about these rumors as well, since, in the middle of the night of 26 January 1536 he summoned Carpi to tell him that he deplored these rumors and considered Carpi a good servant. The King wrote to the Pope, asking for a red hat for Carpi; the Pope replied that it would be a subject for the next Consistory for the creation of cardinals.Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction,\\" p. xxxv. Carpi also initiated discussions about having a general council of the Church to address the problems of heresy and church reform, though it became clear immediately that the King and the Emperor had entirely different views as to how, and where, and what. Lestocquoy, \\"Introduction\\", pp. xix-xx. He left France in July 1537, having already been appointed Cardinal. =Cardinalate= Pope Paul III created Rodolfo Pio da Carpi a cardinal in the Consistory of 22 December 1536, and on 23 July 1537 he was given his cardinal's ring and the titulus of Santa Pudenziana.Wilelmus Gulik and Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi Tomus III, editio altera (Monasterii 1923) p. 25. He exchanged S. Pudenziana for Santa Prisca on 28 November 1537. On 19 December 1537 Cardinal Carpi was named Legatus a latere to King Francis I of France.Hoffmann, p. 18. He travelled to France in the company of Cardinal Cristoforo Jacobazzi, who had been named Legate to the Imperial Court in Spain. Both cardinals had a personal interview with King Francis at Montpellier in mid-January 1538.Hoffmann, p. 19. His purpose, and Jacobazzi's, was to bring together Francis I and Charles V in a meeting with Pope Paul III. The meeting duly took place in May, though at Nice rather than at Montpellier,De Leva, III, pp. 237-241. but Cardinal Carpi did not attend. He had been sent to Rome, to act as the Pope's prefect and Legate of the City in the Pope's absence. On 21 April 1539,Hoffmann, p. 22, with note 76a. Gulik and Eubel, p. 27, note 11. Carpi was appointed Legate to the March of Ancona; he served until 1542.He was still in office on 30 October 1542: Hoffmann, pp. 24-25. The province was in disarray, due to the repeated campaigns of the French and Imperialists. After restoring order, Carpi's most important work in that office was the revision of the Aegidian Constitutions, by which the March had been governed since 1357. Carpi's work, into which he drew the assistance of fourteen experts, was finally given approval and authorization by Pope Paul III in September 1544. In 1543, Cardinal Carpi composed a Memorandum for the Emperor Charles V, entitled \\"Discorso del rev. card. di Carpi del 1543 a Carlo V Cesare del modo di dominare\\". The manuscript has never been published, but brief quotations have been published by Ludwig Pastor.Hoffmann, pp. 25-26. The subject was the Duchy of Milan, which the Emperor Charles had taken from Francis I, and the content was advice on how to retain it. On no account should it be returned to Francis I. Cardinal Carpi, as he now was, made his presence felt in the Roman Curia as a member of the Roman Inquisition and a defender of the new orders, the Capuchins and the Jesuits.J. Wicki, \\"Rodolfo Pio da Carpi, erster und einziger Kardinalprotektor der Gesellschaft Jesu,\\" Miscellanea Historiae Pontificiae (1959), pp. 243‚Äì267. Cardinal Pio da Carpi became Cardinal Priest of San Clemente on 24 September 1543, which he exchanged for Santa Maria trans Tiberim on 17 October 1544.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 62 and 66. In 1544 he was offered the See of Agrigentum (Girgenti) in Sicily by Charles V, and he was approved as Administrator of Girgenti by Pope Paul III on 10 October 1544. He held the post until his death. He never went to Girgenti, of course, since the appointment was only a financial benefit.Gulik and Eubel, p. 99. Cardella, p. 174. In 1544, the Cardinal presided over the establishment of the Accademia degli Imperfetti in Meldola, the tiny principality of which his uncle Alberto Pio da Carpi had been the first ruler. This academy for the encouragement of cultured persons; the stimulation of culture itself was another of those multitudinous clubs that were formed in cities and towns throughout Italy for the pursuit of intellectual growth.L' Accademia degli Imperfetti, Meldola. There was a more famous academy of the same title in Venice. =Conclave of 1549-1550= Pope Paul III died on Sunday, 10 November 1549.Gulik and Eubel, p. 20 n. 2. Cardinal Pio da Carpi was one of the fifty-one cardinals who participated at one point or another in the Conclave which began on 29 November 1549. There was much illness, coming and going, and one death in the Conclave. In the first Scrutiny, which did not take place until 4 December, at which forty-one cardinals were present, Cardinal Reginald Pole, the favorite candidate of the Emperor, received between 24 and 26 votes, only four (or two) votes short of a valid canonical election. The French Ambassador protested that if the election took place without the presence of the French cardinals, who were en route, he would declare the Election invalid. The French were promoting Giovanni Salviati (Bishop of Porto and cousin of Catherine de' Medici, Queen of France) and Ridolfo Pio de Carpi, and were commanded to prevent the election of Cardinal Pole at all costs. Cardinal Carpi received nine votes in the fourteenth Scrutiny on 17 December, just after the majority of the French cardinals had entered the Conclave. But it was his high water mark. The French votes quickly redeployed, seeking a more viable candidate. The last of the French cardinals, the Cardinal de Bourbon, did not reach the Conclave until 14 January 1550, thereby raising the number of participants to 48. The voting had fallen into a stagnant pattern, 21 votes for Pole, 21 votes for Carafa of Naples. Forty-seven cardinals participated in the final vote, which took place on 7 February 1550 and elected Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, a member of the Farnese faction.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante of 1549-1550. Retrieved: 2016-04-19. Pope Julius III (Ciocchi del Monte) promoted ('preferred') Cardinal Carpi to the See of Frascati (Tusculum) on 11 December 1553. Cardinal Carpi was 'preferred' to the See of Porto on 29 May 1555.Gulik and Eubel, p. 57. In 1558, King Philip II of Spain bestowed an annual income of 10,000 scudi upon the diocese of Agrigento (which had been worth only 4,000), which was still being held by Rodolfo Pio da Carpi as a gift from the Emperor Charles V. The new grant was for services rendered, no doubt, and in anticipation of future services on the part of a most influential Cardinal.Hoffmann, p. 28. =Conclave of 1559= Pio da Carpi was the favorite candidate of King Philip II of Spain in the Conclave of 5 September‚Äì26 December 1559, which followed the death of Pope Paul IV, along with Jacopo Puteo (President of the Inquisition in Rome), Giovanni Angelo de' Medici (brother of the Marchese di Marignano), and Clemente D'Olera (former head of the Observant Franciscans). All of those candidates were rigorously orthodox, which was an essential criterion for Philip II's choice. It was said by the French Ambassador that Cardinals Carpi and Ricci were circulating a story in the Conclave to the effect that Cardinal de' Medici had Lutheran tendencies, and that he had said that it might be necessary to loosen the requirements on celibacy of the clergy and to allow the laity to receive both the bread and the wine in Holy Communion.Letter of Philibert Babou, Bishop of Angoul√™me, to Cardinal de Lorraine-Guise, Prime Minister of Fran√ßois II. Carpi had been the leader of the Imperial faction in the Conclave of 1555. The intractable resistance of the leader of the French faction, cardinal Ippolito d'Este, however, prevented his being considered a serious candidate for the papacy. On 18 May 1562, Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was promoted Bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals, succeeding Fran√ßois de Tournon who had died on 22 April 1562.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 21 and 56. =Artistic interests= Roman marble bas-relief in the gardens of the Villa Carpi, drawn by the French visitor Pierre Jacques, ca. 1576 (Biblioth√®que Nationale). Carpi's broader modern interest for historians centers on his collection of classical sculpture and other antiquities, which formed one of the prominent museums of Rome. Roma nihil possidet magnificentius, nihil admirabilius one guidebook remarked (\\"Rome possesses nothing more magnificent, nor to be more admired\\"). And his Greek and Latin library, dispersed after his death, brought scholars and humanists, not invariably good Catholics, to his palazzo in the Campo Marzio, the Campus Martius of Antiquity. Also his suburban villa was on the site of the gardens of Sallust, on the flank of the Quirinal Hill. In the 1550s the Flemish medallist and epigrapher Antoine Morillon studied the Latin inscriptions in the Cardinal's gallery. Even reading the dry inventories furnish materials for the historian of taste.e.g. C. Franzoni et al., Gli inventari dell'eredit√† del cardinale Rodolfo Pio da Carpi Pisa, 2002, for the Musei Civici, Comune di Carpi. The semi-public collections of princes and cardinals made Rome a museum-city, memorialized by Ulisse Aldrovandi's guidebook Delle Statue antiche che per tutta Roma si veggono, 1556in French, Les Antiquit√©s de la cit√© de Rome, 1576. Aldrovandi praised the delights of the Carpi antiquities in their rustic suburban setting. Even after Cardinal Carpi's death, the collections drew sculptors and artists. Among the antiquities that belonged to Cardinal Carpi: * The bronze bust called the Capitoline Brutus that Pio da Carpi bequeathed to the City of Rome, now in the Capitoline Museums. (Haskell and Penny, cat. 14). * The ecstatic marble head called the Dying Alexander, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence by 1579; often copied in plaster, bronze and marble. (Haskell and Penny, cat. 2). * Bronze and marbles bought from Duke Alfonso II d'Este some of which disappeared after they belonged to Rudolf II at Prague. * A 5th-century manuscript of the complete works of Virgil, called the Medici Virgil after it was purchased for the Laurentian Library, Florence. Cardinal Carpi did not neglect the moderns; among his paintings: * Madonna of the Divine Love, school of Raphael, which Vasari said had been commissioned by the cardinal's father, Leonello da Carpi; it passed to the Farnese and in now at the Capodimonte Museum, Naples. * History of the Madonna of Loreto and Saint Jerome in his study by Lorenzo Lotto. * Portrait of a Man, originally attributed to Sebastiano del Piombo; now thought to be by Francesco Salviati, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. =Death= Cardinal Carpi died in Rome on 2 May 1564, in his 65th year, at the Palazzo Pallavicini in the Campo Marzio, where he had a lease for life. He had long suffered from gout (podagra), by which he was so tormented in the last four months of his life that he could not eat, speak or sleep without great pain. On his death he left a considerable debt, which was criticized by Pope Pius IV.Wilelmus Gulik and Conradus Eubel, p. 25, note 5. He is interred in Rome at Santissima Trinit√† dei Monti, above the Spanish Steps, where there is a sepulchral monument erected to his memory by Pope Pius V in 1568. He lived 64 years, 2 months, and 8 days, according to the inscription; from this is calculated the day of his birth. References Further reading  * *J.

It was a major source of goods, especially copper, for ancient Egypt and other states in the Ancient Near East. It is referred to in a number of the surviving texts and is now thought to be the ancient name of Cyprus, or an area of Cyprus. This was confirmed by the scientific analysis performed in the Tel Aviv University of the clay tablets which were sent from Alashiya to other rulers.Goren et al. 2003 Texts The name of the state transliterated as \\"Alashiya\\" is found on texts written in Egyptian, Hittite, Akkadian, Mycenean (Linear B) and Ugaritic. It corresponds to the Biblical Elishah. Some of the Amarna letters are from the king or the ministers of Alashiya. They concern mostly the amount of copper that has been sent from Alashiya and requests for silver or ivory in return. One letter refers to 500 talents of copper (probably about 12.5 tons) and makes excuses as to why so little copper has been sent. Pharaoh is also referred to by the King of Alashiya as his \\"brother\\", indicating that the king regarded himself as an equal, probably because of the economic power of his kingdom. Papyrus Anastasi IV, written several centuries later, also refers to copper (as well as cows) sent from Alashiya to Egypt.Knapp 1996 Any place identified as Alashiya must therefore have had sizable copper production during the Late Bronze Age. There are a number of other clues in the texts. The Amarna letters contain references to a ship belonging to the King of Alashiya and the men of Lukki (probably part of the Sea Peoples, similar to pirates) seizing villages in Alashiya.Armstrong 2003 In other correspondence, the King of Ugarit pleads for help from the King of Alashiya to protect Ugarit from the Sea Peoples. Another document from Ugarit records the banishment of two princes to \\"the land of Alashiya\\". One further text found at Ugarit may contain a further clue to the location of the capital city of Alashiya, as it could imply that the city was located on a mountain. However, this word has more usually been translated as shore.Goren 2003 The first recorded name of a Cypriote king is \\"Kushmeshusha\\" as appears on letters sent to Ugarit in the 13th c. BCE. The extant ending of the Story of Wenamun records how Wenamun, a priest of Egypt, had been blown off course on the sea journey from Byblos to Egypt and ended up on Alashiya. Wenamun reports that he was almost killed by an angry mob, but was rescued by Hatbi, the \\"princess of the town\\". Some of the last texts referring to Alashiya are from the Hittite Empire (based in modern Turkey) and boast of quelling Alashiya by force. However, with all such military reports it is difficult to assess the true outcome. =List of Amarna letters from Alashiya= *EA 33; Title: An Alliance in the Making *EA 34; Title: The Pharaoh's reproach answered *EA 35; Title: The hand of Nergal *EA 36; Title: More about copper *EA 37; Title: More about silver *EA 38; Title: A brotherly quarrel *EA 39; Title: Duty-Free *EA 40; Title: Duty-Free, Governor to Governor Identification  Alashiya therefore needs to be situated somewhere where there was sizable Bronze Age copper production, on the coast, and in the East Mediterranean. Some scholars have suggested sites and areas of Syria or Turkey, but it is now generally (although not universally) agreed that Alashiya refers to at least part of Cyprus.Wachsmann 1986 Specifically, it was generally argued that the site of Enkomi was the capital of the kingdom of Alashiya, which covered the entire island of Cyprus.Knapp 1997 The identification of Cyprus with Alashiya was confirmed by the 2003 publication by Goren et al. of an article in the American Journal of Archaeology detailing the petrographic and chemical analysis of a number of the Amarna and Ugaritic letters sent from Alashiya. These examinations of the provenance of the clay used to create the tablets indicate that Syria could not be the location of Alashiya, while clay on Cyprus is a good match. However, this analysis showed that the clays did not originate anywhere near the site of Enkomi and that suitable clays are close to the sites of Kalavasos and Alassa (itself a possible cognate of Alashiya). These sites, especially Kalavasos, were also important Late Bronze Age sites and are located close to sources of copper. Moreover, ArmstrongArmstrong, 2003 argues that there is considerable evidence for regional variation and that there is no evidence for a centralized, island-wide political authority on Cyprus during the Late Bronze Age. It is therefore currently unclear whether the kingdom of Alashiya comprised the whole of Cyprus, with the capital city moving location (probably starting with Enkomi), or was always sited at Kalavasos, or whether Alashiya comprised only one region of Cyprus.Goren et al. 2003; Armstrong 2003 References Sources *Armstrong, K.

USSR whiteprints. 70s Whiteprint describes a document reproduction produced by using the diazo chemical process. It is also known as the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the blueprint process for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes. Blueprints replaced by whiteprints The diazo printing process Left is a diazonium cation, which combines with a coupler (middle) to give a deeply colored azo dye. Two components underpin diazo printing: # diazonium salt: a light sensitive chemical # the coupler: a colorless chemical that combines with the salt to produce color. In a related sense, the process relies on two properties of diazonium compounds: # they are deactivated by light, i.e. they degrade irreversibly to products that cannot form deeply colored dyes # they (the diazonium compounds that were not degraded by light) react with a (colorless) coupling agent to give deeply colored product(s) In a variety of combinations and strengths, these two chemicals are mixed together in water and coated onto paper. The resulting coating is then dried yielding the specially treated paper commercially sold as Diazo paper. This solution can also be applied to polyester film or to vellum. The process starts with original documents that have been created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, vellums, linens, and translucent bond papers (bonds). Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, the intensity of the UV exposure light is adjusted according to media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs. The original document is laid on top of the chemically-coated side of a sheet of diazo paper, which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two sheets are fed into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the diazo paper) pass in front of an ultraviolet lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light sensitive diazonium salt wherever there was no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase. Next, the original is peeled from the diazo paper as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is fed into the developing chamber. Here, fumes of ammonium hydroxide create an extremely alkaline environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but sepia (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original no more than four or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of ammonia fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room. A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists. Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to outside. Smaller and mid-size blueprint machines were often outfitted with neutralizers which absorbed some of the ammonia for a period of time. If the lines are too light, it is also possible to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media. Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia. Sometimes both the master and the diazo print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the diazo paper and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines. Diazo printing was one of the most economic methods to reproduce large engineering and architectural drawings. Fading prints A quirk of diazo blueline prints is that with continued exposure to ultraviolet light, either from natural sunlight or from typical office fluorescent lighting, a blueline copy can fade over a span of months (indoors) or just days (outdoors), becoming illegible. This fading process thus requires reduplication of the original documents every few months in a typical office for any project using bluelines. Hence, blueline drawings that are used as engineering working copy prints have to be protected when not in use by storing them in flat files in the dark. Incandescent lighting was often used in areas where blueline engineering prints needed to be posted on a wall for long periods to hinder rapid fading. Improperly exposed bluelines are more likely to fade at an increased rate since the chemical reaction in the ammonia phase continues until the process is completed. But also properly exposed bluelines should not be exposed to the elements, and bluelines kept in flat files or hanging on racks in a cool, dry room often retain the majority of their lines and are able to be subsequently scanned into a digital format for various purposes. Demise of the technology The blueline print process was largely abandoned within the architectural/engineering community around the early 2000s. Contributing factors were the development of computer aided drafting and printing, the speed of machine printing, and the introduction of larger xerographic machines from companies like Ricoh and Xerox. The cost of blueline production materials and equipment, the fact that the prints themselves faded in sunlight, and the need to use the pungent chemical ammonia as a developer sped up its replacement.

Plot summary  Dr. Barbara is a disgraced doctor who forms a small band of environmentalists to attempt to save the albatross from nuclear testing by the French government on the remote Pacific island of St. Esprit. Neil, a na√Øve 16-year-old, joins the group and the story is told from his perspective. During an illegal landing on the island, Neil is caught on film being shot in the foot by a French soldier. The subsequent news coverage makes Neil, and their environmental campaign, media celebrities. This allows a return visit to the island with a larger and more eccentric group of campaigners. Whilst attempting to land, a French navy frigate collides with their boat. This event is broadcast live to the world by the cameraman who dies in the collision. The subsequent adverse news coverage causes the French to leave the campaigners unmolested on the island. The coverage also leads to a deluge of gifts from well wishers all over the world, a steady stream of visitors and a growing collection of endangered animals which are meant to use the island as sanctuary. Visitors include a representative from Club Med who investigates whether the island can be turned into a resort. These excesses cause Dr. Barbara to manipulate Neil and other residents to commit ever greater acts of sabotage to cut themselves off from the outside world. Gradually, the male residents of the island (except Neil) become ill and slowly die under the 'care' of Dr. Barbara. As fewer able bodied residents are left, the endangered animals they are supposed to be saving are killed and eaten. Slowly, Neil realises that his role is to father as many children as possible from the female residents. As more visitors arrive on the island, the female members stay and the male members disappear. When another young man arrives on the island, Neils role as stud is in jeopardy and he too becomes ill whilst the new arrival is kept healthy. Slowly, over the course of the story, the environmentalists change from being the sane ones in an insane world into total insanity as Dr. Barbara's all female 'paradise' is constructed. Neil and the remaining residents are rescued in the nick of time by the French navy after a couple who only just manages to escape alerts the authorities to what is really happening on the island.

It is a right (eastern) tributary to the Meuse (). About 90 percent of the river's course is in Germany. It is not to be confused with the rivers Ruhr and R√∂hr, which are tributaries of the Rhine in North Rhine-Westphalia. Geography The Rur between Monschau and Dedenborn during winter The Rur in the High Fens The Rur rises in the High Fens, near the high Signal de Botrange in Belgium at an elevation of above sea level. South of Monschau it flows into Germany, through North Rhine- Westphalia. It flows first through the northern part of the Eifel mountains. After it reaches the Rur Reservoir, the second-largest artificial lake in Germany. After approximately it flows into the Netherlands, and at its mark it flows into the river Meuse in the town of Roermond. Major tributaries of the Rur include the Inde and the Wurm. The towns along the Rur are Monschau, Heimbach, Nideggen, D√ºren, J√ºlich, Linnich, H√ºckelhoven, Heinsberg (all in Germany) and Roermond (Netherlands). In the 1960s and 1970s, the northern part of the Rur was heavily polluted by the tailings of many German coal mines. Neither fish nor other organisms could be found, and it was dangerous to swim in the river. Foam flakes regularly flooded parts of the city of Roermond. After the closure of the mines, the waste water treatment in Germany and the Netherlands greatly improved. Only the lower part of the river is still contaminated.Water quality chart of the Rur published by the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia The water in the upper part of the river is so clean that trout and more than 30 species of fish are back. After an absence of 125 years, salmon returned to the Rur in 2004. =Tributaries= * Ellebach * Inde * Kall * Malefinkbach * Merzbach * Wurm * Olef * Urft History During the Middle Ages the valley of the Rur lay mostly within the Duchy of J√ºlich. In 1795, until 1814, during which time the area was part of the French Republic and Empire, it gave its name to the French d√©partement of the Roer. The Rur represented an important front in the Allied push towards Germany at the end of the Second World War. A fortified area known as the Roer Triangle, formed by the towns of Roermond and Sittard, in the Netherlands, and Heinsberg in Germany, was the scene of heavy fighting at the beginning of 1945. Operation Blackcock was the code name for the clearing of the Roer Triangle. It was conducted by the 2nd British Army between 14 and 26 January 1945. The objective was to drive the German 15th Army back across the Rivers Rur and Wurm and move the frontline further into Germany. The operation was carried out under command of the XII Corps by three divisions. The operation is relatively unknown despite the sometimes fierce battles that were fought for each and every village and hamlet within the \\"Roer Triangle\\". Between 16 December 1944 and 23 February 1945, the U.S. Ninth Army was unable to advance across the Rur during Operation Queen, because German forces controlled dams close to the river's source in the densely forested region of the Hohes Venn. This meant Axis forces could potentially blow the dams, releasing enough water to wash out an Allied assault. At the same time, the German Ardennes Offensive meant any further westward push would leave Allied forces stretched and supply lines exposed. Eventually the counteroffensive was overwhelmed and German engineers, under pressure of aerial and artillery bombardment, released the dams. As the flood waters began to subside, Allied forces crossed the Rur in rafts in the early hours of February 23, 1945, as part of Operation Grenade.

Design and development The Widgeon was originally designed for the civil market. It is smaller but otherwise similar to Grumman's earlier G-21 Goose, and was produced from 1941 to 1955. The aircraft was used during World War II as a small patrol and utility machine by the United States Navy, US Coast Guard and by the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. The first prototype flew in 1940, and the first production aircraft went to the United States Navy as an anti- submarine aircraft. In total, 276 were built by Grumman, including 176 for the military.

After scanning the area, Farr spotted the U-boat cruising beneath the surface of the waves. Unable to accurately determine the depth of the vessel, Haggins and Ferr radioed the situation back to base and followed the enemy in hopes that it would rise to periscope depth. For three hours, the crew shadowed the submarine. Just as Haggins was about to return to base, the U-boat rose to periscope depth, and Haggins swung the aircraft around, aligned with the submarine and dove to . Farr released one of the two depth charges, blowing the submarine's front out of the water. As it left an oil slick, Farr made a second pass and released the other charge. Debris appeared on the ocean's surface, confirming the U-boat's demise and the Civil Air Patrol's first kill.Civil Air Patrol =Postwar operations= Grumman Widgeon at Garland's Seaplane Base on the Detroit River in 1947 After the war, Grumman redesigned the aircraft to make it more suitable for civilian operations.

Evening in Parambikkulam, Kerala, India View on the bay of Naples, overlooking Mount Vesuvius at 7:30 p.m. local solar/standard time Evening is the period of a day from the end of the afternoon to the beginning of night. The exact times when evening begins and ends depend on location, time of year, and culture, but it is generally regarded as beginning when the sun is low in the sky and lasting until the end of twilight. Etymology The word is derived from the Old English «£fnung, meaning 'the coming of evening, sunset, time around sunset', which originated from '√¶fnian' meaning 'become evening, grow toward evening'. The Old English, '√¶fnian' originated from '√¶fen' (eve), which meant 'the time between sunset and darkness', and was synonymous with even (Old English √¶fen) which meant the end of the day. The use of evening dates from the mid 15th century. Cultural significance Some languages that use the time of day in greeting have a special greeting for the evening, such as the English \\"good evening\\". Typically people do not leave somebody and say \\"good evening\\". Even if it isn't night yet when one greets someone, they can greet them with \\"good evening\\" and when they leave, they say \\"good night\\", rather than saying \\"good evening\\" as a farewell, despite that it may still be evening. Many people greet someone with the shortened \\"evening\\" rather than \\"good evening\\". Social and family activities are often held during this time, such as supper or more formal social gatherings and entertainment, such as parties, in particular, dance parties.

He is responsible for Digital Underground's \\"The Humpty Dance\\", 2Pac's breakthrough single \\"I Get Around\\", and co-producer of 2Pac's debut album 2Pacalypse Now. Early life Jacobs spent most of his childhood moving around the East Coast with his family, eventually settling in Tampa, Florida. As a drummer he won the 1978 \\"Most Talented\\" trophy at Greco Junior High School, but after relocating to Queens, New York (as a result of his parents' divorce), he traded his drums in for a set of turntables upon discovering and marvelling over hip hop while the art form was still in an underground developmental stage. He was mentored in the craft by his cousin Rene Negron (a.k.a. DJ-Stretch), and their close friend Shawn Trone (a.k.a. MC Shah-T of the parody-rap group No Face) who suggested Greg use the name \\"Shah-G\\". Jacobs liked the idea, but mistakenly thought his friend said \\"Shock-G\\", and began using that name instead. Less than two years later - after returning to Tampa - he dropped out of Chamberlain High School to form the Master Blasters, a mobile DJ crew which featured three DJs and four emcees at its height. They performed at parties, and also for the crowds at Riverfront Park's outdoor Sunday gatherings, eventually capturing the interest of Tony Stone, a program director at WTMP radio, which was the city's primary R&B; station. Tony offered Jacobs, who was sixteen at the time, a job DJing on the air, and for a short while, as \\"Gregory Racker\\", he was the youngest radio personality in central Florida with a regular time slot. After being fired for playing the fifteen-minute-long album version of \\"(Not Just) Knee Deep\\" by Funkadelic in a five-minute time slot, and also after tensions with his father escalated, Jacobs found himself backpacking the United States for a few years, drifting through odd jobs and petty criminal adventures. It was during this excursion that his focus switched from DJing to keyboard playing, and while utilizing piano practice-rooms at music stores and colleges around the country, he effectively taught himself to play the piano. Deciding to pursue music seriously, he returned home, quickly obtained a diploma, and began attending Hillsborough Community College, where he studied music theory under Jim Burge and piano under Patricia J. Trice. It was there at HCC that he met and formed a bond with Kenneth Waters, and the two began performing together under various names including The Chill Factor, and also The Four Horsemen, which included MC Skoobie-D, and the MD Dazzlin Doc-P who had recently moved to Tampa from the Bronx, hip hop's birthplace. Then in 1985, after two years of producing local artists for hire, playing solo piano gigs around town, performing with Kenny, and being a keyboardist in Warren Allen Brooks' band, Greg and his aspiring-actress girlfriend (Davita Watts) set their sights beyond Tampa, and eloped to Los Angeles in search of greater opportunity. There he played keyboards in Kenny McCloud's pop-funk band Onyx before leaving Los Angeles and finally arriving in the San Francisco bay area where he found work in an Oakland music store, and where his group Digital Underground would form a few years later. Career =Digital Underground= Soon after relocating to Oakland, California, Shock G formed Digital Underground along with Chopmaster J, and the late Kenneth Waters (a.k.a. Kenny-K). After around fifteen months of unsuccessful negotiations with various small record companies, in 1988 the trio finally released a 12-inch single on Macola Records. It featured \\"Your Life's a Cartoon\\" as the A-side and \\"Underwater Rimes\\" as the B-side. Both songs were penned, produced, and performed by Jacobs, who also sketched the cartoonish cover illustrations. The record included the logo for Digital Underground's startup label, TNT, as well as Macola's logo. TNT was also founded by Tupac Shakur's management CEO Atron Gregory. In 1989, the group signed with Tommy Boy Records and released \\"Doowutchyalike\\", receiving minimal radio airplay but became an underground hit. Its video was more successful, reaching number 40 on the MTV's top 100 videos of the year. \\"Doowutchyalike\\" paved the way for Digital Underground's debut album Sex Packets and the highest charting song of their career \\"The Humpty Dance\\" both released in early 1990, and both achieving platinum sales certifications by the RIAA. The latter was rapped by \\"Humpty Hump,\\" the most flamboyant of Shock G's several alter egos. By that time, Digital Underground had expanded significantly, with DJ Fuze, Money-B, and Schmoovy-Schmoov joining the group, and with Ramone \\"Pee Wee\\" Gooden and Tupac Shakur joining by 1991. =Other identities= Throughout Shock G's rapping career, he created several aliases, resulting in characters that were maintained with such reality, they were believed to be separate people by some music fans, even a few industry insiders. As \\"Rackadelic\\" he illustrated album covers and provided art direction; as the \\"Piano Man\\" he contributed keyboard tracks and music production. His main persona \\"Shock G\\" utilized a more natural voice, while he altered his voice to become \\"Humpty Hump,\\" an iconic character with an exaggerated buffoon persona, colorful clothes, and a Groucho glasses-and- nose disguise. He used a nasal voice for the character Humpty. At most public appearances, Jacobs would show up as one person or the other, but at live shows and video shoots he would use a stand-in or camera tricks to maintain the illusion. A fictional biography was constructed for Humpty, the story being that Edward Ellington Humphrey III, former lead singer of \\"Smooth Eddie and the Humpers,\\" had become a rapper after burning his nose in a kitchen accident with a deep-fryer. Jacobs also sometimes performs as other characters including MC Blowfish, Icey-Michael Boston, The Computer Woman, ButtaFly, and Peanut Hakeem. =Television and film work= Shock G's TV appearances include Showtime at the Apollo in 1992, several The Arsenio Hall Show performances between 1990 and 1994, and several live MTV performances, including MTV Spring Break 1990 in Daytona Beach, Yo MTV Raps (performing live with Ed Lover and Doctor Dr√©) in 1991, Club MTV Live (with Downtown Julie Brown) in 1992, and MTV Jams in 1994. Most of these consisted of music performances with either Digital Underground or 2Pac, however, on an episode of the 1991 sitcom Drexell's Class Jacobs played a small acting role as a furnace repairman. Within the show's story, the title character, Otis Drexell, insists that the furnace repairman looks exactly like Humpty Hump, but both himself and his coworker (Jason Priestley), have never heard of any such hip-hop artist, especially not one with such a ridiculous name. The episode ends with a live performance of Digital Underground's \\"No Nose Job\\" on a cruise ship full of Sports Illustrated swimsuit models, which is presented as a scene from one of Mr. Drexell's dreams. With his Digital Underground band members, Jacobs appeared in the Dan Aykroyd directed comedy Nothing but Trouble appearing as both Shock-G and Humpty Hump. The group makes a cameo music performance, as well as play a small character role in the film as themselves. Since then, Jacobs has appeared in a handful of music documentaries, including Thug Angel: Life of an Outlaw (2000) about Tupac Shakur, and Parliament Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove (1996) about George Clinton & P-Funk, both of which received heavy TV rotation, and both of which relied heavily on Jacobs' commentary. On June 24, 2011, Shock G was featured on an episode of the podcast \\"You Had To Be There\\" with comedians Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer. =Albums= * Fear of a Mixed Planet (2004 33rd Street Records) * Fear of a Mixed Planet; Bonus Edition (2008 Jake Records) * with Digital Underground: =Production, solo work, and miscellaneous= In addition to his work with Digital Underground, Shock G has found moderate success as a solo artist and music producer. In 1993, Shock G produced Tupac Shakur's breakthrough platinum single \\"I Get Around\\" as well as guest starred on the single and music video, and went on to produce Tupac's \\"So Many Tears\\" from his multi-platinum 1995 album Me Against the World. Tupac's first published work was while still a member of Digital Underground when he appeared on the 1991 song and video \\"Same Song\\", which also appeared in the Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and Demi Moore film Nothing but Trouble. Shock co-produced Tupac's debut album 2Pacalypse Now. Shock G appeared as a producer and guest artist on fellow Oakland-based rap group The Luniz platinum debut release Operation Stackola in 1995, also appearing as a guest emcee in the \\"I Got 5 on It\\" Bay Ballers Remix and video. In 1996 the Wayans brothers' film Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood featured the Shock-G song \\"We Got More\\". The song, which featured Oakland rappers Luniz was used for three different scenes in the film, and is featured in two different places on the soundtrack, making it the only song to appear twice on one soundtrack. In 1998, Prince included the Shock G produced \\"Love Sign\\" on his triple-CD Crystal Ball album. Shock G has toured and performed on stage with George Clinton and P-Funk including a guest performance with Clinton at Woodstock 1999. In 2003, Shock G produced the single \\"Risky Business\\" for Los Angeles underground artist Murs, and also appeared in the video, as himself and as Humpty Hump. Murs performed this song live with Shock G at the Paid Dues festival, and also featured him as his stage DJ/music conductor on a 2-month extensive Definitive Jux label U.S. and Canada tour. On January 20, 2009, Shock G's single \\"Cherry Flava'd Email\\" was renamed and released as a special edition called \\"Cherry Flava'd Election\\" to commemorate the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Shock G has worked, and finished a voice over for his character in the 2017 Tupac Shakur biopic All Eyez on Me.

It acts similarly to normal quicksand, but it does not contain any water and does not operate on the same principle. Dry quicksand is an example of a granular material. Historically, the existence of dry quicksand was doubted, and the reports of humans and complete caravans being lost in dry quicksand were considered to be folklore. In 2004, it was created in the laboratory, but it is still not clear what its actual prevalence in nature is. Scientific research Writing in Nature, physicist Detlef Lohse and coworkers of University of Twente in Enschede, Netherlands allowed air to flow through very fine sand (typical grain diameter was about 40 micrometers) in a container with a perforated base. They then turned the air stream off before the start of the experiment and allowed the sand to settle: the packing fraction of this sand was only 41% (compared to 55-60% for untreated sand).. Lohse found that a weighted table tennis ball (radius 2 cm, mass 133 g), when released from just above the surface of the sand, would sink to about five diameters. Lohse also observed a \\"straight jet of sand [shooting] violently into the air after about 100 ms\\". Objects are known to make a splash when they hit sand, but this type of jet had never been described before. Lohse concluded that :In nature, dry quicksands may evolve from the sedimentation of very fine sand after it has been blown into the air and, if large enough, might be a threat to humans. Indeed, reports that travellers and whole vehicles have been swallowed instantly may even turn out to be credible in the light of our results. During the planning of the Project Apollo moon missions, dry quicksand on the moon was considered as a potential danger to the missions. The successful landings of the unmanned Surveyor probes a few years earlier and their observations of a solid, rocky surface largely discounted this possibility, however. The large plates at the end of legs of the Apollo Lunar Module were designed to reduce this danger, but the astronauts did not encounter dry quicksand.  In popular culture  In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Jones and Marion end up struck in a dry sandpit.

His inventions include, most famously, the Hammond organ, the Hammond clock, and the world's first polyphonic musical synthesizer, the Novachord.  Youth  Laurens Hammond was born in Evanston, Illinois, on January 11, 1895 to William Andrew and Idea Louise Strong Hammond. Laurens showed his great technical prowess from an early age. His father, William, took his own life in 1898, ostensibly due to the pressures of running the First National Bank, which he had founded. Upon her husband's death, Idea, who was an artist, relocated to France with Laurens to further her studies, and the family spent the next eleven years in France and Germany.  Early inventions  When the family returned to Evanston in 1909, Laurens, then 14, was fluent in French and German. While in Europe, he had already designed a system for automatic transmission for automobiles. At his mother's suggestion, he submitted his designs to engineers at French automaker Renault, although they were not accepted. His first patent, in 1912, was for a barometer that could sell for one dollar. University and military service Hammond studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He graduated with honors in 1916.Lee (2000), p. 155 When the United States entered World War I, Hammond served with the 16th Regiment Engineers (Railway), American Expeditionary Force, in France. He rose to the rank of captain.  Inventions  Following the war, Hammond moved to Detroit, where he was chief engineer for the Gray Motor Company, a manufacturer of marine engines. A partner in the company, Col. John H. Poole, with whom he had served in France, knew of his engineering skills, and paid him an extra $300 a week under the table to stay with Gray Motor. In 1919, he invented a silent spring-driven clock. This invention brought him enough money to leave Gray Motor Company and rent his own space in New York City. In 1922, Hammond invented the Teleview system of shutter glasses in association with 3-D films. One feature was made for the system, The Man from M.A.R.S.. He premiered this show at the Selwyn Theatre in New York in December 1922 to critical acclaim, but the cost of installing the expensive machinery in the theater was prohibitive, and the process was never used again. A 2‚ÄìD version of the film, renamed Radio-Mania, continued to screen. Hammond's work on the synchronous motor led him in 1928 to set up the Hammond Clock Company, with six workers, above a grocery store in Chicago. Demand was high and the business soon grew into a large factory. He was responsible for a number of other inventions, such as an electric bridge table. In 1933, Hammond bought a used piano, and discarded everything apart from the keyboard action. Using the keyboard as a controller, he was able to experiment with various sound-generating methods until he found the best one--the tonewheel generator. The company's assistant treasurer, W. L. Lahey, was the organist at the nearby St. Christopher's Episcopal Church, and Hammond consulted him concerning the quality of the new instrument's sound. Thanks to Hammond's prior manufacturing and engineering experience, the tonewheel generator was extremely well-engineered by the time the \\"Hammond Organ\\" finally went into production in 1935. Tonewheel organs are still in regular use in the twenty-first century, which is a testament to the quality of the design and execution of the product. Hammond filed his patent application on January 19, 1934. At that time, unemployment was a major problem due to the Great Depression, and with this in mind, the Patent Office rushed to grant his application,U.S. Patent 1,956,350, Electrical Musical Instrument with the hope of creating jobs in the area. Hammond was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Price Wetherill Medal in 1940 for the invention of the Hammond electric organ. World War II During World War II, Hammond helped design guided missile control systems, light-sensing devices for bomb guidance, glide-bomb controls, and a new type of gyroscope. The glide bomb was the forerunner of today's guided missile.  Later life and death  Hammond left his position as president of his company in 1955, and retired from the company in 1960, at the age of sixty-five. During his life he held 110 patents. He was married to Roxana Scoville, and had one daughter. He died in Cornwall, Connecticut on July 1, 1973, aged 78. In 2017 the Laurens Hammond Museum was founded in Kielce, Poland.https://kielce.wyborcza.pl/kielce/7,35254,22570048,otwarcie-muzeum- laurensa-hammonda-w-kielcach-pierwszego-takiego.html Notes  Further reading  The most comprehensive source on Laurens Hammond's life and inventions is the book by Stuyvesant Barry, Hammond as in Organ: The Laurens Hammond Story.

In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company. In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions (according to general opinion); in the stage version, the song represents the company of The Taming of the Shrew taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allowed the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line 'According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to 'According to the latest report'. The song has also been covered by many artists. Notable recordings *Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song for her 1956 album \\"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook\\". *Petula Clark recorded it for her album Petula Clark in Hollywood (1959). *Mel Torme - included in Mel Torm√© Swings Shubert Alley 1960) *Erasure for the Red Hot + Blue compilation (album and video versions) in 1990. *Stacey Kent - for her album The Boy Next Door (2003) *Anthony Strong on his 2013 album Stepping Out *Holly Cole in the album Shade (2013) In popular culture On February 16,1964 Mitzi Gaynor performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show broadcast live from the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach in between the two sets of The Beatles for their second appearance on the show. This song was the soundtrack of a 2003 Adidas commercial. The song gained new currency in 2004 because of two films that came out that year. The first was the Porter biopic De-Lovely, and the second was the movie Kinsey, which used the tune because Porter mentioned the Kinsey report on American sexual attitudes in the song's bridge. This song is referenced in the title song of the 2008 musical In the Heights by Usnavi. In 2013 for Verve Remixed: The First Ladies, RAC (DJ) did a chill version of Ella Fitzgerald's take. In 2015, Katie Derham danced the Charleston to 'Too Darn Hot' on the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing with her professional dancing partner Anton Du Beke.

It is served by Universitate metro station. Four statues can be found in the University Square, in front of the University; they depict Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu (1879), Michael the Brave (1874), Gheorghe LazƒÉr (1889) and Spiru Haret (1932). The Ion Luca Caragiale Bucharest National Theatre and the Intercontinental Hotel (one of the tallest buildings in Bucharest) are also located near University Square. University Square marks the northeastern boundary of the Old Center of Bucharest. Since the end of 2014, after a project costing up to 65 million euros, the National Theatre has a new face, dominated by futuristic elements. History 2014 FIBA Europe 3x3 Championships at the University Square In the 15th century, here was the northern limit of the city. Around 1700, the limit was already around what is today Pia»õa RomanƒÉ (Roman Square). Thought to define the axes north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest of the city after 1880, \\"the great crossroad\\" (, ) follows the Haussmannian scenario of urban modernization ‚Äì in the spirit of the Parisian influence of those times. This intersection has never evolved as a monumental square, but emerged as most important road junction of the capital at the geometric center of the city. The Bucharest boulevards of those times hosted tram lines, and in the center of the intersection was placed the monument dedicated to Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, the square then bearing his name. Today this place is called 21 December 1989 Square, in honor of those who died during the Romanian Revolution. This square was part of an east‚Äìwest axis full of important monuments, starting in the east with Pia»õa Rosetti (Rosetti Square) and culminating with the statue of Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu in the eponymous square. University Square was established in 1857 as part of the creation of the University of Bucharest (architect Alexandru OrƒÉscu), its character being defined by four statues, made over six decades: Prince Michael the Brave (1876, sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse) and scholars Ion Heliade- RƒÉdulescu (1882, Ettore Ferrari), Gheorghe LazƒÉr (1886, Ion Georgescu) and Spiru Haret (1935, Ion Jalea). In 1679 the Princely School was built here, which in the 18th century was to become the Princely Academy (a sort of university) and in 1818 St. Sava National School, then in 1857 the University of Bucharest. The University was built in several stages, following neoclassical aesthetic principles. The facade existing today was constructed between 1921‚Äì1943 (architect Nicolae Ghika-Bude»ôti). The InterContinental, Col»õea Hospital and Three Hierarchs Church Pedestrians can cross the streets only by University Passage, constructed in the socialist period during the development of M2 metro thoroughfare and leading, as well, to a metro station. The space that now extends from the InterContinental hotel and National Theatre once was home to an outdoor circus, around which existed shops with mititei (small Romanian sausages) and beer, and a stum shop (?) named Zori de zi. All this disappeared after urban planning in the 1960s proposed the idea of developing the area through tourism, cultural or administrative functions. Between 1968 and 1970 the Hotel InterContinental (architects Dinu Hariton, Gheorghe NƒÉdrag, Ion Moscu and Romeo Belea) was built, and the new National Theatre was constructed between 1964‚Äì1973 in the style of that period, the halls being equipped with top stage installations. Damaged during the 1977 earthquake, the theater was rebuilt 1982‚Äì1984, under the aegis of Cezar LƒÉzƒÉrescu, in a heavy form and lacking spectacular elements. The square was the site of the 1990 Golaniad, a peaceful student protest against the ex- communists in the Romanian government. The demonstrations ended violently when miners from the Jiu Valley were called in by president Ion Iliescu to restore order in Bucharest (see: Mineriad).

He led a local rebellion which seized Sangju. He is remembered primarily as the father of Gyeon Hwon, the king of Hubaekje.

Ajagae was born and lived most of his life in Gaeun, in modern-day Mungyeong City, where he was a farmer.

Formerly aligned with the National Front, a British neo-Nazi group, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1989, repudiated his earlier views, and now writes from a Catholic perspective. He is a co-editor of the St. Austin Review and editor-in-chief of Sapientia Press. He also teaches Shakespearian literature for an online Catholic curriculum provider. Joseph Pearce has authored biographies of literary figures, including The Quest for Shakespeare, Tolkien: Man and Myth, The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde, C. S. Lewis and The Catholic Church, Literary Converts, Wisdom and Innocence: A Life of G.K. Chesterton, Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile and Old Thunder: A Life of Hilaire Belloc. His books have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Italian, Korean, Mandarin, Croatian, and Polish. Biography =Early life= Pearce was born in Barking, London, and brought up in Haverhill, Suffolk.Pearce (2013), pages 35-37. In August 1973, when Joseph was twelve years old, his family moved back to Barking.Pearce (2013), pages 37-48. National Front At 15, Joseph joined the youth wing of the National Front (NF), a far right political party opposed to a multiracial and multiethnic United Kingdom. At the time large numbers of immigrants from India and Pakistan were moving into Barking. Violence between white and Asian youths was commonplace and the NF, which Pearce has described as, \\"an emerging force then in British politics that demanded the compulsory repatriation of all nonwhite immigrants,\\" was very popular among the white residents of Barking. Race with the Devil by Joseph Pearce He was closely involved in NF organisational activities and first came to prominence in 1977 when, at the age of sixteen, he set up Bulldog, the paper of the organisation. Bulldog became associated with some of the most virulent NF propaganda. In 1980, Pearce became editor of Nationalism Today, in which he argued vehemently in favour of racial preservation, producing a pamphlet entitled Fight for Freedom! on this theme in 1982. In his 2013 memoirs, Pearce writes that, while the NF denied being a neo-Nazi organization, the claim became harder to sustain the farther you went up the leadership rungs. NF members were urged to read Holocaust denial literature and the writings of David Irving. Furthermore, dissident members of the NF were routinely called \\"Strasserites\\", after the brothers who challenged Adolf Hitler for leadership of the Nazi Party. According to Pearce, far-left activists were responsible for most of the violence at NF rallies, but the fights drove out moderates. He described the Battle of Lewisham as a \\"watershed\\": \\"Prior to that, the marches were mainly middle-aged, middle-class people. There were squadron leaders, Second World War veterans. And then with the increase of violence and the media interest before Lewisham a lot of the older people stayed away, because there was clearly going to be a riot and they didn‚Äôt want to be part of it.\\" \\"[T]he skinhead thing came back. Lots of football hooligan types who were racist came along for the fights. The violence from the extreme Left provoked violence in reaction. Then it got out of control, with thousands of football hooligans and skinheads, and then what you saw was 2,000 bald young men walking down the street doing Nazi salutes.\\"West, Ed: \\"The Diversity Illusion\\" (2013). Gibson Square Books. Chapter 2. Due to the white supremacist nature of his articles, Pearce was twice prosecuted under the Race Relations Act of 1976,Joseph Pearce, \\"Race with the Devil\\" and served prison time in 1982 and 1985‚Äì1986.Searchlight, December 1984. He was a close associate of Nick Griffin, and both were attacked by Martin Webster for devoting too much time to writing for the Third Position magazine Rising and not enough to their NF duties.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 34 As a result, he joined Griffin in resigning from the NF in November 1983 before circulating a statement in which they complained about Webster's role in the party. The statement claimed that Pearce and Griffin were leaving to avoid a Webster-led witch hunt and it had the effect of ensuring the removal of Webster from his post as National Activities Organiser.Searchlight magazine, January 1984 Returning to the NF, Pearce became editor of Nationalism Today which supported the Political Soldier line within the NF. In this position he argued vehemently in favour of racial preservation, producing a pamphlet entitled Fight for Freedom! on this theme in 1984.M. Durham, 'Women and the National Front', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson & M. Vaughan (eds.), Neo-Fascism in Europe, London: Longman, 1991, pp. 265-6 Initially an enthusiastic supporter of the Political Soldier tendency, Pearce adopted their support for ethnopluralism and on this basis contacted the Iranian Embassy in London in 1984 to try to secure funding for the NF, although it came to nothing.Ray Hill with Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror, London: Grafton, 1988, p. 254 However, as time went on Pearce, who came from a working-class background and so was much more popular with NF skinheads than the rest of the university-educated Political Soldiers, became disillusioned with the lack of electoral activity and moved towards Andrew Brons. Before long Pearce became a full member of the Flag Group and was expelled along with the rest of that group by the Official National Front in 1986. Pearce became a leading member of the new group and sought to extend their activities. A regular writer and editor for Flag Group publications, he contributed to the group's ideology, notably arguing in favour of distributism in a 1987 edition of party magazine Vanguard.G. Gable, 'The Far Right in the United Kingdom', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson & M. Vaughan (eds.), Neo-Fascism in Europe, London: Longman, 1991, p. 262 Earlier in his career, Pearce had even contacted John Tyndall to suggest the possibility of an alliance with the British National Party. The idea was considered by Tyndall but was ultimately rejected on the advice of Ray Hill and Charles Parker.R. Hill with A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror, London: Grafton, 1988, pp. 173-4 Between 1980 and 1985, Pearce befriended Italian neofascist leader Roberto Fiore, who was on the run from charges relating to the 1980 Bologna train station bombing. In his 2013 memoirs, Pearce expresses a belief that Fiore and his organisation were not involved in any way with the bombing and that the Italian government was using the attack to settle a score with far- right organizations.Pearce (2013), pages 113‚Äì116. Northern Ireland Pearce was also a member of the Orange Order and, between 1978‚Äì1985, a frequent visitor to Northern Ireland. During his visits, he established close and friendly relationships with the Ulster Defence Association leader Andy Tyrie, Ulster Freedom Fighters leader John McMichaelPearce (2013), pages 108‚Äì109. and Ulster Volunteer Force member George Seawright.Pearce (2013), pages 112‚Äì113.Searchlight magazine, February 1986. Despite his sympathy for the Loyalists, Pearce rebuffed all attempts to recruit him into the violent aspect of the Troubles. He has written, \\"For all my extremism, I had no desire to kill anybody, or to have someone kill anybody for me.\\"Pearce (2013), page 112. Pearce has also written, \\"In spite of my own unwillingness to become too directly involved in the terrorist operations in Northern Ireland, I was very aware, as were the leaders of the UVF and UDA, that National Front members serving with the Army in Northern Ireland were smuggling intelligence information on suspected IRA members to the Loyalist paramilitaries. This information included photographs of suspected IRA members, the type of car they drove and its registration number, and other useful facts. I have little doubt that this information was used by the UVF and UDA to target and assassinate their enemies.\\"Pearce (2013), page 111. In 1979, Pearce was invited to a debate about immigration on BBC Radio 1 alongside a member of the Anti-Nazi League, and Stiff Little Fingers frontman Jake Burns. Pearce has written that he remembers little of the debate, \\"beyond the obvious vituperative exchanges between me and the equally acrimonious young person who represented the Anti-Nazi League.\\"Pearce (2013), pages 140‚Äì141. After the broadcast, Pearce was astonished when Burns invited him to share a pint at a local pub. During their drink, Burns, who was known for, \\"seeking peace in Northern Ireland while I was preaching total war,\\" attempted to gently persuade Pearce to reconsider his opinions. Pearce has called this encounter with Burns as one of many, \\"lights of clarity that led the way out of the darkness.\\" =Conversion= As the Flag Group ran out of momentum, Pearce largely faded from the scene, having decided to convert to Catholicism during his second prison term. Despite efforts by Ian Stuart to draw him back into the NF, Pearce took no role in the organization that was led after 1990 by Ian Anderson. According to Pearce, \\"'A sound atheist cannot be too careful of the books that he reads.' So said C. S. Lewis in his autobiographical apologia, Surprised by Joy. These words continue to resonate across the years that separate me from the bitterness of my past. What is true of the atheist is as true of the racist, which is what I was. A hell of hatred consumed my youth. Eventually I stumbled out into the brilliance of Christian day, but, looking back along that path, I can see in my mind‚Äôs eye the literary candles that lit the way. There are dozens of candles bearing the name of G. K. Chesterton, of which Orthodoxy, The Everlasting Man, The Well and the Shallows, and The Outline of Sanity shine forth with particular brightness. Almost as many candles bear the name of Chesterton‚Äôs great friend, Hilaire Belloc, and several bear the name of John Henry Newman. And, of course, there is the flickering presence of Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. These and countless others light the path by which I‚Äôve traveled.\\" Race with the Devil by Joseph Pearce Pearce's conversion to Catholicism was influenced by the writer G. K. Chesterton =Biographer= As a Catholic author, Pearce has focused mainly on the work of English Catholic writers, such as J. R. R. Tolkien, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. His book Literary Converts, published in 1999, captures this interest and consists of essays showcasing the process of conversion of many writers who became convinced Catholics.Kate Duffern, Review of Literary Converts. Catholic Insight, 1 May 2001. Pearce has also promoted the social doctrine of the Church, in particular Distributism as a Catholic economic system. His main contribution in this area has been his book Small is Still Beautiful, which takes up the theme proposed earlier by E. F. Schumacher in his book Small Is Beautiful.Small is Still Beautiful In 1998, Joseph Pearce wrote to Alexander Solzhenitsyn and expressed interest in writing a biography of him. Pearce mentioned in his letter that he had already published a biography of G.K. Chesterton and that he hoped to correct the faults of other Solzhenitsyn biographies by placing the writer's Christian Faith at center stage. Pearce did not expect to hear back, but Solzhenitsyn replied almost immediately and invited Pearce to travel to Russia to begin work on the biography. When Pearce arrived at the Solzhenitsyn family's residence, Alya Solzhenitsyn made a point of showing that her husband was collecting the complete works of Chesterton. During their meetings, Solzhenitsyn told Pearce that he sees Russia and the West as two parts of a threatened Christian civilization. Solzhenitsyn on Russia and the West by Joseph Pearce. In his 2013 memoirs, Pearce has described his meetings with Solzhenitsyn as \\"one of the greatest moments of my life. I am also gratified to know that the great Russian writer approved of my biography of him.\\"Pearce (2013), page 226. Pearce has also written a biography of Anglo-South African poet and Catholic convert Roy Campbell, whose nationalist sympathies during the Spanish Civil War have caused him to be labeled a Fascist and left out of modern poetry anthologies. Pearce's biography reveals that Campbell lost his job as editor of the magazine Voorslag and was subjected to social ostracism after publishing articles urging racial equality in 1920s South Africa. Pearce also describes how Campbell rebuffed efforts by Sir Oswald Mosley to recruit him into the British Union of Fascists. Pearce further cites evidence from Campbell's letters and poetry to show that the latter supported the British war effort against Nazi Germany. Pearce has also edited an anthology of Campbell's poetry and verse translations, which remains in print. =Television= Joseph Pearce is the host of the EWTN television series The Quest for Shakespeare based on his book The Quest for Shakespeare: The Bard of Avon and the Church of Rome. The show concentrates on the evidence that Shakespeare was a Catholic and consists of thirteen episodes.The Quest for Shakespeare. EWTN website, Accessed 5 May 2009. Also on EWTN, Pearce was the host for a special hour-long program which was broadcast Dec. 14, 2014, titled Tolkien: Elves, Hobbits, and Men. Pearce emphasized some elements of The Lord of the Rings which in his opinion are based on Tolkien's Catholic Faith. For example, Pearce draws a parallel between Boromir's death scene and the Sacrament of Penance. The program broadcast again Dec. 16, 2014. Personal life Joseph Pearce married Susannah Brown, an American woman with family roots in Northern Ireland, in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Steubenville, Ohio in April, 2000.Pearce (2013), Race with the Devil, pages 226-228.

It does not appear in the Younger Futhark. It is named peor√∞' in the Anglo-Saxon rune-poem and glossed enigmatically as follows: : peor√∞ by√æ symble plega and hlehter / ∆ølancum [on middum], √∞ar ∆øigan sitta√æ / on beorsele bli√æe √¶tsomne :\\"Peor√∞ is a source of recreation and amusement to the great, where warriors sit happily together in the beerhall.\\" The name is not comprehensible from Old English, i.e. no word similar to peor√∞ is known in this language. According to a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795), written using the Gothic alphabet in Britain, the letters êçÄ p (based on a Greek Œ†) and êåµ q (an inverted Œ†) are called \\"pair√æra\\" and \\"qair√æra\\", respectively. One of these names clearly is derived from the other. However, the names are not comprehensible in Gothic either, and it is not clear which is derived from which, although it is known that the Elder Futhark had a p, but no q rune. In any case, it seems evident that peor√∞ is related to pair√æra. The Anglo-Saxon futhorc adopted exactly the same approach for the addition of a labiovelar rune, c∆øeor√∞, in both shape and name based on peor√∞, but it is not known if the Gothic runes already had a similar variant rune of p, or if the labiovelar letter was a 4th-century creation of Ulfilas. The Common Germanic name could be referring to a pear-tree (or perhaps generally a fruit-tree). Based on the context of \\"recreation and amusement\\" given in the rune poem, a common speculative interpretation is that the intended meaning is \\"pear-wood\\" as the material of either a woodwind instrument, or a \\"game box\\" or game pieces made from wood. From peor√∞, Proto-Germanic form *per√∞u, *per√æ≈ç or *per√æaz may be reconstructed on purely phonological grounds. The expected Proto-Germanic term for \\"pear tree\\" would be *pera-trew√¥ (*pera being, however, a post-Proto-Germanic loan, either West Germanic, or Common Germanic, if Gothic pair√æra meant \\"pear tree\\", from Vulgar Latin pirum (plural pira), itself of unknown origin). The Ogham letter name Ceirt, glossed as \\"apple tree\\", may in turn be a loan from Germanic into Primitive Irish. The earliest attestation of the rune is in the Kylver Stone futhark row (ca. AD 400). The earliest example in a linguistic context (as opposed to an abecedarium) is already in futhorc, in the Kent II, III and IV coin inscriptions (the personal names pada and √¶pa/epa), dated to ca. AD 700. On St. Cuthbert's coffin (AD 698), a p rune takes the place of Greek Œ°. The Westeremden yew-stick (ca. AD 750) has op h√¶mu \\"at home\\" and up duna \\"on the hill\\". Looijenga (1997) speculates that the p rune arose as a variant of the b rune, parallel to the secondary nature of Ogham peith. The uncertainty surrounding the rune is a consequence of the rarity of the *p phoneme in Proto-Germanic, itself due to the rarity of its parent-phoneme *b in Proto-Indo-European. The rune is discontinued in Younger Futhark, which expresses /p/ with the b rune, for example on the Viking Age Skarp√•ker Stone, :iar√æ sal rifna uk ubhimin for Old Norse :J√∂r√∞ skal rifna ok upphiminn. :\\"Earth shall be rent, and the heavens above.\\" References *A.

It is a sequel to the Witcher short stories collected in the books The Last Wish () and Sword of Destiny () and is followed by Time of Contempt (). The book won the Janusz A. Zajdel Award in 1994 and the David Gemmell Legend Award in 2009. An English translation was published in the United Kingdom in 2008 (Gollancz) and in the United States in 2009 (Orbit). Plot About a year before the beginning of the novel (as chronicled in the preceding short story \\"\\"Much More\\"), the Empire of Nilfgaard attacks the Kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe, mortally wounded, commits suicide and her granddaughter, Cirilla, called Ciri and nicknamed the \\"Lion Cub of Cintra\\" manages to flee from the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find her. He knows that this young girl has great importance, not only because of her royal lineage, but also because of her elven blood which gives her immense magical potential. The war ends with Nilfgaard's defeat by a coalition of the Northern Kingdoms, though the Empire retains much of its power. Almost two years after the armistice, the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms meet in secret to discuss the political situation. Peace with Nilfgaard is not what it was supposed to be - the Empire's financial clout is ruining the northern economy, Imperial emissaries agitate aristocrats and merchants against their monarchs, elves and dwarves have formed partisan groups called Scoia'tael (Squirrels) and are conducting acts of terror against humans - and in every major city cultists are prophesying that the world will end, unless the Savior comes from the South. The kings decide to start a war, before the Empire weakens their countries further, and to regain Cintra. They are aware that the Emperor is looking for Ciri to marry her (morganatically) and thus to legitimize his continuing occupation of Cintra. To prevent this, the monarchs decide to find and kill Ciri. Ciri is being protected by the Witcher Geralt of Rivia, a magically and genetically mutated monster-slayer-for-hire, who takes her to the witchers' keep, Kaer Morhen, to be educated and trained by the few remaining witchers. The oldest member of the Order, Vesemir, asks the sorceress Triss Merigold to come to Kaer Morhen and help with occasional strange and abnormal behavior he had seen in Ciri. Much of what Triss observes is just the normal aspects of a woman's maturation, which the (exclusively male) Witchers are ignorant of, but she eventually realizes that Ciri is a \\"Source\\". She acknowledges that she does not have the power to control Ciri's talent, and advises Geralt to swallow his pride and seek help from his former lover Yennefer, a much more experienced and powerful sorceress. At the same time, a mysterious wizard called Rience is searching for Ciri, the servant of a more powerful mage, whose identity remains unknown. He captures Geralt's friend, Dandelion the bard, and tortures him for information about Ciri. Dandelion is saved by the timely arrival of Yennefer, who engages in a short magic duel with Rience. Rience manages to escape through a portal opened by his master, but is left with a prominent facial scar from Yennefer's spell. In the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, intending to deliver Ciri to the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a \\"normal\\" education from the priestess Nenneke. On the way, Triss falls ill, and they join Yarpen Zigrin's dwarven company who is leading a caravan for King Henselt of Kaedwen. Geralt tells Ciri about the roses of Aelirenn, an elf who died leading elven youths to fight the humans in a hopeless attack. The caravan is attacked by the Scoia'tael, and it is revealed that the escort mission was a trap set by the kings who doubted Yarpen's loyalty. Ciri's stay in Ellander is still haunted by disturbing dreams until the arrival of Yennefer, who starts educating her in the ways of magic. From an initial antagonism, their relationship develops into a strong and deep bond, like that of a mother and daughter. Meanwhile, Geralt does his best to track Rience and his mysterious employer. With the help of Dandelion, the novice priestess Shani, and the sorceress Philippa Eilhart, he forces a confrontation with Rience (the latter aided by the famous Michelet brothers, quadruplet assassins for hire), during which both are injured. Rience's master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented from pursuing the mage by Eilhart, who also kills the last surviving Michelet brother so as to keep Geralt from learning the mysterious mage's identity. Geralt is left gravely wounded. As they are about to leave the Temple School in Ellander, Yennefer asks Ciri whether she did not like her at first, leading to a series of flashbacks detailing Ciri's studies with Yennefer from the day they were introduced and back to the present as they are about to leave the Temple. Ciri admits that she did not like Yennefer, at first, and they leave. Characters * Geralt of Rivia. A Witcher, a human who has been transformed into a supernatural monster-slayer by the ingestion of various mutagens. Although Witchers rarely get involved in politics, Geralt takes under his charge a political refugee called Ciri, the granddaughter of the previous Queen of Cintra, a kingdom destroyed by Nilfgaardian invaders. He is the protagonist of tie-in videogames The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. * Triss Merigold. A powerful sorceress and member of the Chapter of Wizards, Triss wields significant power and unclear motives. * Cirilla, the Lion-Cub of Cintra, is the young granddaughter of the deceased and overthrown Queen Calanthe of Cintra. The blood of the elves flow through her veins, and she is hunted down for the mysterious yet dangerous power which she possesses. * Dandelion. Geralt's best friend. A charming, famous poet who is also a spy for the King of Redania. * Yennefer of Vengerberg. Another member of the Chapter of Wizards, and an on-again off- again lover of Geralt's. Considered more powerful than even Triss Merrigold, Yennefer is called upon to try and gain an understanding of Ciri's power. * Philippa Eilhart. A senior sorceress of the Chapter of Wizards, and trusted advisor to the King of Redania, alongside royal spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra. She is one of the few mages that has mastered the rare art of magical polymorphy, enabling her to transform into an owl.

(subtitled The All-New Press Your Luck for its first season) is an American television game show that aired new episodes on Game Show Network from April 15, 2002 to July 25, 2003. The game show was produced by FremantleMedia North America, in association with Game Show Network. The main goal of the game is to earn as much money and prizes as possible through collecting spins by answering trivia questions correctly, then using those spins on a gameboard to win various prizes and cash amounts while attempting to avoid the show's eponymous character, the \\"Whammy.\\" Contestants who do land on a Whammy lose all their prizes accumulated to that point; four Whammies eliminates a contestant from the game. The program is an updated version of Press Your Luck, which originally aired on CBS in 1983‚Äì86. The series was taped at Tribune Studios and was hosted by Todd Newton, with Gary Kroeger announcing. The show aired in reruns on GSN until 2017, and came back on May 11, 2020. Gameplay Gameplay remained largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes and attempting to avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At the start of the game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board.Brooks 2009, pp. 1503 After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one resulted in bankruptcy and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100‚Äì$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared. Round two consisted of five questions (four in some episodes) posed to the players. The host read a question, and one of the contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round. In the final round, cash values ranged from $500‚Äì$5,000, and some spaces offered additional spins in addition to cash. Other spaces offered the choice of up to four adjacent spaces, or directed the contestants directly to another space. Accumulating four Whammies eliminated a contestant from the game. Also added to the board were \\"Double Whammies,\\" which‚Äîin addition to bankruptcy‚Äîadded a physical consequence following the Whammy's appearance (e.g., spraying the contestant with water or dropping ping pong balls on them). Play began with the contestant with the lowest score at the start of the round, or, in the case of a tie for last place, the contestant with the fewest spins. If there was still a tie in terms of score and spin totals, the contestant farthest to the left went first. Spins earned in this round could be passed to the opponent with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin was added to the earned total. The contestant in the lead at the end of the game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike its predecessors, three new contestants appeared on each episode. =Other features= In round one, the board featured a \\"Pick-a-Prize\\" space. Contestants who landed on it could choose any prize on the board at the time. In round two, one space labeled \\"$2,000 or Lose-1-Whammy\\" gave the contestant a choice of a cash prize of $2,000 or removing a previously-landed-upon Whammy (also seen on the classic show). \\"$1,000 or Spin Again\\" offered the choice of a $1,000 cash prize or the opportunity to spin again (without using an earned spin), in season two, the cash award of this space was lowered to $555. Contestants also had an opportunity to win a Gem Car during the game. To claim the prize, the contestant needed to land on the \\"GEM\\" space in round one, and avoid landing on a Whammy for the rest of the round. In round two, the contestant needed to land on the \\"CAR\\" space, and again avoid the Whammy, and also win the game. In season two, the GEM car was replaced with a Suzuki Aerio SX, and the contestant needed to claim both halves of a car key in order to win the prize. A new feature called \\"Big Bank\\" was added for the second season. The Big Bank on each episode was a cumulative jackpot that began at $3,000, and any cash and prizes that the contestants lost after landing on a Whammy (including halves of the car key) were added into the bank. If a contestant landed on the Big Bank square, Todd Newton asked an open-ended general knowledge question to the contestant, who could claim the money and prizes in the Big Bank with a correct answer. Once the Big Bank was claimed by a contestant, it was reset to $3,000. Technological changes Whammy! made use of technological advances that had been developed since the original Press Your Luck ended its run in the 1980s. For example, the prizes and light patterns for each space on the Big Board were randomly generated using a personal computer, running at a speed of 200 MHz. This resulted in a very large number of patterns for gameplay, which prevented memorisation of patterns as Michael Larson did on Press Your Luck (the same holds true for all subsequent versions). Also, the Whammy animations were animated in 3D computer graphics, rather than being digitally hand-drawn as on Press Your Luck.DeMichael 2009, pp. 29 Production Host Todd Newton in January 2010 Game Show Network (GSN) acquired the rights to air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order a revival of the series.Baber 2008, pp. 257‚Äì58 Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter TomarkenBaber 2008, pp. 258 and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, \\"It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [the audition]. I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake.\\" Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience. GSN produced 65 episodes for the first season, which began airing April 15, 2002. The series was eventually renewed for a second season, which consisted of 65 additional episodes that premiered March 17, 2003. Following the conclusion of the Tournament of Champions, which completed its run on July 25, 2003.DeMichael 2009, pp. 27 Additionally, a short-lived Filipino version of the show aired on GMA Network in 2007‚Äì08. The series, entitled Whammy! Push Your Luck, was hosted by Paolo Bediones and Rufa Mae Quinto. =Special episodes= The show aired four holiday specials: a Mother's Day special (featuring an all-cash board and with Karen Grassle (Little House on the Prairie), Estelle Harris (Seinfeld) and Mimi Kennedy as contestants), a Halloween special (featuring contestants in costume), a St. Patrick's Day special (with the contestants wearing green, and all the whammy animations in green as well), and an April Fools' Day special that featured Graham Elwood (from Cram) as the episode's host, with Newton only appearing when a contestant hit a Double Whammy. Janie Litras and Ed Long appeared on a special episode coinciding with GSN's documentary Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal. Litras and Long originally appeared on the episodes airing June 8 and 11, 1984, competing against Michael Larson, who had memorized the light pattern and went on to win $110,237. Larson's brother, James, competed in the 2003 episode against Litras and Long, as Michael had died of throat cancer in 1999. Tomarken made a special appearance hosting the question round of this episode, which would be one of his last television appearances. James would win the game with a digital grand piano worth $6,695. The July 21, 2003 episode featured a \\"Tournament of Losers\\" starring three past contestants who had lost their previous games. July 22‚Äì25 of that same week in 2003 featured a Tournament of Champions, with nine of the biggest winners to that point competing for additional cash and prizes. The winners on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday episodes returned to compete against each other on the Friday episode in the finale of the tournament. Friday's episode featured higher-valued spaces in both rounds, and the eventual winner also received a Suzuki Aerio SX as a bonus prize in addition to their grand total winnings. Reception Whammy! lasted on GSN for only two seasons, leading Garin Pirnia of Mental Floss to deem the series \\"[not] a huge hit like its predecessor.\\" At the sixth World Media Economics Conference, Eileen O'Neill and Marianne Barrett listed Whammy! among several television series that used creative methods of advertising in their programs, noting GSN's ability to \\"encourage viewers to watch the programs live.\\"O'Neill 2004, pp. 10 The series was also mentioned in Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock's The Ultimate TV Game Show Book in a list of GSN original programs.Ryan 2005, pp. 238 It would not be until 2019 that another revival of Press Your Luck would air, with this version being hosted by Elizabeth Banks on ABC.

Many climbers will frequently try to redpoint a route after having failed to on-sight or flash it, although occasionally a climber will forgo an onsight attempt if they suspect that the route is so difficult that an attempt would be pointless. Redpointing differs from headpoint, in that it is exclusive to sport routes with protection equipment fixed into the rock at regular intervals. The English term \\"redpoint\\" is a loan translation of the German Rotpunkt coined by Kurt Albert in the mid-1970s at Frankenjura. He would paint a red X on a fixed pin so that he could avoid using it for a foot- or handhold. Once he was able to free-climb the entire route, he would put a red dot at the base of the route. In many ways, this was the origin of the free climbing movement that led to the development of sport climbing ten years later. Modern sport climbing ethics do not consider it a redpoint if one successfully climbs a route on toprope without using or weighting the gear or rope, though leading with preplaced quickdraws is typically allowed, even in international climbing competitions. Free-climbing while leading with preplaced quickdraws is sometimes referred to as a pinkpoint. Traditional climbers sometimes use a variant of the term, greenpoint, to describe leading a sport climb using only natural protection, i.e. without using preplaced bolts or pins.

The first one was described by Ondra as the hardest he ever climbed. It consists of 10 incredibly hard and unusual moves, including single-finger locks, climbing upside down and a variation of a figure four move. : :* Perfecto Mundo - Margalef (ESP) - May 9, 2018 - First ascent by Alex Megos.

Chris Sharma climbing in Yangshuo (CHI) : :* Open Air - Schleier Waterfall (AUT) - 1996 - First ascent by Alexander Huber, who initially proposed a 9a rating. Heralded as the world's hardest route upon completion, the route was first repeated twelve years later by Adam Ondra, who upgraded it to 9a+, trying to fit the grade to the \\"new school\\" rating conventions. According to Alexander Huber, the route is at least as difficult as La Rambla, first climbed by him in 1994. Those who doubt that the original version of La Rambla is 9a+ (including Huber), might consider Open Air to be the first 9a+ in history. :* Realization - Montagne de C√©√ºse (FRA) - July 2001 - First ascent by Chris Sharma.

Based on its similarity with La Rambla Extension, a longer version of the same route, La Rambla might be considered to be the world's first 9a+, but Huber would probably disagree. In his opinion, both routes are \\"not harder than\\" Wolfgang G√ºllich's Action Directe, the word's first 9a, which in 1994 was still rated 8c+. In 2003, Ram√≥n Juli√°n Puigblanque climbed both routes and graded them 9a+. Since the additional 6 meters of La Rambla Extension were much easier than La Rambla's crux, Puigblanque believed that they did not increase the difficulty of the ascent enough to justify a higher rating. :* Bain de Sang Saint-Loup (Pompaples, ) - 2012 - First 9a female ascent in history by Josune Bereziartu.

Reign Seongjong was born on 15 January 961, the second son of Daejong, and a grandson of King Taejo (the founder of the Goryeo Dynasty). He ascended the throne after his cousin and also his brother-in-law King Gyeongjong died in 981. After he ascended the throne, Seongjong was at first content not to interfere with the provincial lords, and to appease the Silla aristocracy. Seongjong married a woman of the Silla royal clan. In 982, Seongjong adopted the suggestions in a memorial written by Confucian scholar Choe Seung-ro (ÏµúÏäπÎ°ú; Â¥îÊâøËÄÅ) and began to create a Confucian-style government. Choe Seung-ro suggested that Seongjong would be able to complete the reforms of King Gwangjong, the fourth King of Goryeo, which he had inherited from Taejo of Goryeo. Taejo had emphasized the Confucian ‚ÄúClassic of History (Êõ∏Á∂ì),‚Äù which stated that the ideal Emperor should understand the suffering of farmers and directly experience their toil. Seongjong followed this principle and established a policy by which district officials were appointed by the central government, and all privately owned weapons were collected to be recast into agricultural tools. Seongjong set out to establish the Goryeo state as a centralized Confucian monarchy. In 983, he established the system of twelve mok, the administrative divisions which prevailed for most of the rest of the Goryeo period, and sent learned men to each of the mok to oversee local education, as a means of integrating the country aristocracy into the new bureaucratic system. Talented sons of the country aristocrats were educated so that they could pass the civil service examinations and be appointed to official government posts in the capital. In September, 995 (the 14th year of Seongjong‚Äòs reign), the nation was divided into ten provinces for the first time. The First Goryeo-Khitan War In late August 993, Goryeo intelligence sources along the frontier learned of an impending Khitan invasion. Seongjong quickly mobilized the military and divided his forces into three army groups to take up defensive positions in the northwest. Advanced units of the Goryeo army marched northwestward from their headquarters near modern Anju on the south bank of the Cheongcheon River. The seriousness of the situation compelled Seongjong to travel from the capital to Pyongyang to personally direct operations. That October, a massive Khitan army said to number nearly 800,000 men (in fact 60,000 men) under the command of General Xiao Sunning swarmed out of Liao from the Naewon-song Fortress and surged across the Yalu River into Goryeo. Waves of Khitan warriors swept across the river and fanned out over the countryside. In bloody back-and-forth warfare, the fierce resistance of Goryeo soldiers at first slowed, then considerably hampered the Khitan advance at the city of Pongsan- gun. But Goryeo's army never surrendered. It stood firm against frontal attacks, broke to retreat and lay ambushes, and launched flanking attacks against the Khitan. Goryeo warriors finally halted Xiao Sunning's army at the Cheongcheon River. In the face of such quick and determined resistance, the Khitan decided that further attempts to conquer the entire peninsula would be far too costly, and sought instead to negotiate a settlement with Goryeo. Without a hint of contrition or humility, the Khitan General Xiao Sunning demanded the surrender of the former territory of Balhae to Emperor Shengzong. He asked that Goryeo sever its relations with Song dynasty and, in the boldest demand of all, that Seongjong accept vassal status under the Liao emperor and pay a set annual tribute to the Liao state. Instead of and rejecting General Xiao's demands outright, the royal court at Kaesong began a heated debate about the Khitan ultimatum. Government officials believed that acceding to General Xiao would prevent further Khitan incursions and urged the court to appease the Liao emperor. Many of the senior military commanders who had recently faced the Khitan army on the battlefield opposed accepting General Xiao‚Äôs terms, including Official Seo Hui, commander of an army group north of Anju. While the bureaucrats argued in Kaesong, General Xiao launched a sudden attack across the Cheongcheon River, directly on the Goryeo army headquarters in Anju. The Khitan assault was quickly repulsed, but it agitated the royal court to a state of near panic. In an effort to calm the court nobility, minister Seo Hui volunteered to negotiate directly with General Xiao. Both parties knew that a key factor influencing the negotiations was the heavy pressure being exerted on the Liao state by Song dynasty. In face-to-face talks with his Khitan counterpart, minister Seo bluntly told General Xiao that the Khitan had no basis for claims to former Balhae territory. Since the Goryeo dynasty was, without question, successor to the former Goguryeo kingdom, that land rightfully belonged under Goryeo's domain. In a cleverly veiled threat, Seo Hui reminded General Xiao that the Liaodong Peninsula had also once been under the dominion of Goguryeo and that the Manchurian territories, including the Khitan capital at Liaoyang, should properly belong to Goryeo. In a remarkable conclusion, minister Seo obtained Khitan consent to allow the region up to the Yalu River to be incorporated into Goryeo territory. General Xiao and the Khitan army not only returned to Liao without having achieved their goals, but the invasion ended with the Khitan giving up territory along the southern Yalu River to Seongjong. Seo Hui's brilliant diplomatic maneuver underscored his correct understanding of both the contemporary international situation and Goryeo's position in the region. The Khitan withdrew and ceded territory to the east of the Yalu River when Goryeo agreed to end its alliance with Song Dynasty. However, Goryeo continued to communicate with Song, having strengthened its position by building fortress in the newly gained northern territories. The Goryeo-Khitan Wars continued with the second and third campaigns until 1018. Death He died of disease in November 997, and he was succeeded by his nephew Mokjong.

All three have now been withdrawn, and two have since been rebuilt for work in Sri Lanka. Early service life The DH class of Northern Ireland Railways consisted of three diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives numbered 1, 2 & 3\\\\. They were built by the English Electric Company at their Vulcan Foundry works in Newton-le-Willows in 1969. The works numbers 3954‚Äì3956 in the EE list, and D1266‚ÄìD1268 in the VF list. They were of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and fitted with Dorman 12QTV engines of , connected to an EE Twin Disc torque converter and a Wiseman final drive. They weighed and had a maximum speed of . They are often referred to with their, \\"DH,\\" prefix. The locomotives were of EE's standard 'Stephenson' class, and were obtained primarily for shunting work, trip freights and engineer's trains. Locomotive No. 1 was the first to enter service on 31 July 1969, with No. 2 following on 27 September and No. 3 on 4 October.http://www.irishtractiongroup.com/ITG_locos/loco_NIR1.htm However, the locomotives were not particularly successful due to problems with the engines overheating regularly while in service. Withdrawal from service and initial preservation All three were put into store during the late 1980s, the first in 1986 (1) and the last in May 1989 (2). The Irish Traction group had approached NIR in August 1989 hoping to run a farewell excursion with No. 2 in September 1989, but this plan failed after No. 2 suffered a catastrophic engine failure on Saturday 9 September 1989 (the day before the excursion),http://www.irishtractiongroup.com/ITG_locos/loco_NIR1.htm despite having been overhauled by NIR at York Road Works. Both Nos. 2 and 3 ended up in secure storage at Larne Harbour, where the Diesel engines, torque converters and final drives were removed in 1991. Originally it was intended to put the locomotives on display at Lisburn, Belfast Central, and Londonderry to celebrate the 150th anniversary of railways in Northern Ireland, and in mid-1989, locomotive No. 1 had its engine, torque converter and final drive removed at York Road works before being repainted in NIR red and moved to the Lisburn Engineer's yard; unfortunately, difficulties in placing the engine meant it was shunted to the back of the yard. Preservation In September 1994, the Irish Traction Group purchased the three locomotives from NIR and moved them south to their restoration base at Carrick-on-Suir. Although Nos 2 and 3 were moved to Lisburn on Sunday 11 September 1994 to be reunited with No. 1, paperwork issues with Iarnr√≥d √âireann regarding the transport of the engines from Lisburn to Carrick-on-Suir meant that the locomotives did not move until Monday 7 January 1995 to Inchicore Works at Dublin, where they spent a week parked outside the running shed at Dublin Heuston. The move was completed on 14 January when the locomotives were towed from Dublin to Carrick-on-Suir. When they moved to Carrick-on-Suir by rail they formed the last recorded un-braked train in Ireland and were regarded as an \\"Engineers Special\\". Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the ITG to prevent the locomotives from being vandalised while at Carrick-on-Suir, they were repeatedly attacked during their ten years of outside storage. This has prompted the ITG in recent times to construct large metal covers to protect any engines stored out of doors at Carrick-on-Suir, both from vandals and deterioration caused by the Irish weather. During this period, it became clear that the ITG could not restore even one of the locomotives to running condition. The major cost was to replace the engine, torque converter and final drive, with prices in the area of ¬£70,000 sterling to replace these components. Several engineering companies also queried whether the locomotives would be made available for sale, though the cost of replacing the engines and related drive components meant that these inquiries did not amount to much more than that. Return to Service In 2005 the ITG was approached by Beaver Power Ltd, who wanted to buy the three locomotives for re-use in Sri Lanka. After much deliberation, the ITG sold Nos. 2 and 3 to Beaver for export to Sri Lanka, and moved to Merthyr Tydfil for overhaul and regauging to allow them to run on the 5 ft 6 in broad gauge tracks in Sri Lanka.http://www.irishtractiongroup.com/ITG_locos/loco_NIR1.htm Locomotive No. 1 was also sent to Merthyr Tydfil for parts recovery to enable the other two to be rebuilt to running condition. At the time, No. 1 was still owned by the ITG, and was not offered for sale until five years later. In May 2006, Nos. 2 and 3 departed for Sri Lanka to work at a Holcim cement plant in the Puttalam area. The work included regauging to 5 ft 6 in (1676 mm), fitting of a Rolls Royce CV12 750 hp Diesel engine coupled to a Twin Disc 13800 MS230 torque converter (both engines had lost their Diesel engines, torque converter and final drives in 1991), and repainting in Holcim livery. In November 2010, the decision was made by the ITG to sell the stripped remains of No. 1 to Beaver, the sale being concluded on 28 November. This locomotive had lost its engine, torque converter and final drive in 1989, and was heavily stripped due to its use by Beaver as a spare parts unit. It is understood that the locomotive will be rebuilt for industrial service, whether in the UK or overseas.http://www.irishtractiongroup.com/ITG_locos/loco_NIR1.htm It is understood that, as of 2010, locomotive No. 3 has been withdrawn and heavily stripped for parts. The locomotive still carries the white Holcim livery that it was painted in when first exported to Sri Lanka, while No. 2 was repainted into a blue and white livery: it is still in service. No. 2 has been named, \\"Shakhti\\", and No. 3, \\"Prince Vijaya\\" - nameplates adorn the cabsides of each locomotive. No. 2 has received a further repaint and now sports a red and white livery with yellow band.

A fort had previously been built on the same site during the French and Indian War. It should not be confused with Fort Herkimer, which was located on the south side of the Mohawk River, in German Flatts, New York. American Revolutionary War This plaque on the County Treasurer's Office in Herkimer, New York references Fort Dayton. The site was located within the fort's stockade. When the American Revolutionary War started, the fort was described as \\"little better than a dilapidated block-house\\". It was rebuilt under the supervision of Colonel Elias Dayton of the 3rd New Jersey Regiment on the orders of General Philip Schuyler in the autumn of 1776. It was a wooden and earthen fortress which enclosed the stone church and other buildings located on the highest ground in the village, once known as \\"Stone Ridge\\". There also was a blockhouse constructed on the hill overlooking Fort Dayton. On August 4, 1777, General Nicholas Herkimer assembled about 900 troops of the Tryon County militia at Fort Dayton for their march to support Colonel Peter Gansevoort at Fort Stanwix, which was under siege by Barry St. Leger's British and Indian forces. Herkimer's troops, consisting mainly of Palatine German settlers, followed the north shore of the Mohawk River, and camped the first night west of Sterling (Staring) Creek. On August 6, Herkimer's troops were ambushed in a small ravine by St. Leger's British, Tory, and Indian forces. General Herkimer himself was wounded, but continued to lead his men in what became known as the Battle of Oriskany. General Herkimer died from his wounds on August 17, at his home near the present day Town of Danube. On February 18, 1779 Henry William Dwight wrote to his brother that 'the people here are scandalously neglected, both with regard to troops and provisions.' He complained of 'no flour and little beef'. (Sedgwick Papers) Fort Dayton was attacked multiple times including the Attack on German Flatts (1778). Fort Dayton was also a base for soldiers aiding Johann Christian Schell after his stand at Schell's Bush and for pursuing Tory leader Walter Butler and his troops. After the destruction of Fort Stanwix in 1781 it was the westernmost fort in the Mohawk valley, and was besieged by Mohawk leader Joseph Brant in 1782. After the war In July 1783 General George Washington toured Fort Dayton, when he was visiting the Mohawk Valley on an inspection tour. The fort was eventually abandoned, and was razed in 1832 to make way for the Erie Canal. A memorial marker of the site of Fort Dayton can be found at the Historic Four Corners intersection on North Main Street in Herkimer. The 1778 attack and the 1782 siege are represented in the historical novel Drums Along the Mohawk and the 'based upon the book' movie of 1939.

In some Christian churches, a reader is responsible for reading aloud excerpts of scripture at a liturgy. In early Christian times the reader was of particular value due to the rarity of literacy.  Latin liturgical rites  In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the term \\"lector\\" or \\"reader\\"The term \\"lector\\" is used in preference to that of \\"reader\\" in the official English text of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (\\"reader\\" is found in no. 352 of this document, but not elsewhere), but \\"reader\\" is used in the English version of the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini, which capitalizes \\"Reader\\" to indicate an \\"instituted\\" reader or lector. can mean someone who in a particular liturgy is assigned to read a Biblical text other than the Gospel. (Reading the Gospel at Mass is reserved specifically to the deacon or, in his absence, to the priest.) But it also has the more specific meaning of a person who has been \\"instituted\\" as a lector or reader, and is such even when not assigned to read in a specific liturgy. This is the meaning in which the term is used in this article. In this sense, the office was formerly classed as one of the four minor orders and in recent centuries was generally conferred only on those preparing for ordination to the priesthood. With effect from 1 January 1973, the apostolic letter Ministeria quaedam of 15 August 1972 decreed instead that: # What up to now were called minor orders are henceforth to be called ministries. # Ministries may be assigned to lay Christians; hence they are no longer to be considered as reserved to candidates for the sacrament of orders. # Two ministries, adapted to present- day needs, are to be preserved in the whole Latin Church, namely, those of reader and acolyte. The functions heretofore assigned to the subdeacon are entrusted to the reader and the acolyte... # The reader is appointed for a function proper to him, that of reading the word of God in the liturgical assembly. Accordingly, he is to proclaim the readings from sacred Scripture, except for the gospel in the Mass and other sacred celebrations; he is to recite the psalm between the readings when there is no psalmist; he is to present the intentions for the general intercessions in the absence of a deacon or cantor; he is to direct the singing and the participation by the faithful; he is to instruct the faithful for the worthy reception of the sacraments. He may also, insofar as may be necessary, take care of preparing other faithful who are appointed on a temporary basis to read the Scriptures in liturgical celebrations. That he may more fittingly and perfectly fulfill these functions, he is to meditate assiduously on sacred Scripture. :Aware of the office he has undertaken, the reader is to make every effort and employ suitable means to acquire that increasingly warm and living love and knowledge of Scripture that will make him a more perfect disciple of the Lord. Canon 1035 of the Code of Canon Law requires candidates for diaconal ordination to have received and have exercised for an appropriate time the ministries of lector and acolyte and prescribes that institution in the second of these ministries must precede by at least six months ordination as a deacon. Instituted lectors, who are all men, are obliged, when proclaiming the readings at Mass, to wear an alb (with cincture and amice unless the form of the alb makes these unnecessary). Others who perform the function of lector, but who are not instituted in the ministry of lector, are neither required nor forbidden by universal law of the Latin Church to wear an alb: \\"During the celebration of Mass with a congregation a second priest, a deacon, and an instituted reader must wear the distinctive vestment of their office when they go up to the ambo to read the word of God. Those who carry out the ministry of reader just for the occasion or even regularly but without institution may go to the ambo in ordinary attire, but this should be in keeping with the customs of the different regions.\\" Like other lay ministers, they may wear an alb or \\"other suitable attire that has been legitimately approved by the Conference of Bishops\\".General Instruction of the Order of Mass, 339 Neither the England and Wales episcopal conference nor that of the United States has specified a particular alternative attire, while in the dioceses of the United States of America, a cassock and surplice may be worn as \\"appropriate and dignified clothing\\". The General Instruction of the Roman Missal speaks as follows of those who, without being lectors in the specific sense, carry out their functions at Mass: \\"In the absence of an instituted lector, other lay people may be deputed to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, people who are truly suited to carrying out this function and carefully prepared, so that by their hearing the readings from the sacred texts the faithful may conceive in their hearts a sweet and living affection for Sacred Scripture.\\" The General Instruction thus makes no distinction between men and women for proclaiming the scriptural readings in the absence of an instituted lector. In its sections the same document lists the lector's specific duties at Mass. Traditionalist Catholic organizations such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney are authorized to use the pre-1973 rite for their members who receive the office of lector.\\"Only in Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life which are under the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, and in those which use the liturgical books of the forma extraordinaria, is the use of the Pontificale Romanum of 1962 for the conferral of minor and major orders permitted\\" (Instruction on the Application of Summorum Pontificum, 30 April 2011, 31). The Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) and other traditionalist Catholic bodies in dispute with the Holy See, such as sedevacantists, use it without seeking authorization.  Eastern liturgical rites  Tonsuring of readers in a seminary by a Russian Orthodox bishop. The readers being ordained are wearing the short phelon (in white). In the Eastern Orthodox Church and in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine tradition, the reader (in Greek, Anagnostis; in Church Slavonic, –ß—Ç–µ—Ü Chtets) is the second highest of the minor orders of clergy. This order is higher than the Doorkeeper (now largely obsolete) and lower than the subdeacon. The reader's essential role is to read the Old Testament lessons (\\"parables\\") and the Epistle lessons during the Divine Liturgy, Vespers and other services, as well as to chant the Psalms and the verses of the Prokimen, Alleluia and certain antiphons and other hymns during the divine services. Due to this fact, it often falls to the reader within a parish to construct the variable parts of the divine services according to the often very complicated rules. This can lead to a very intimate knowledge of the structure of and rules pertaining to the services. There is a special service for the ordination of a reader, although in contemporary practice a layman may receive the priest's blessing to read on a particular occasion. Immediately before ordination as a reader, the candidate is tonsured as a sign of his submission and obedience upon entry into the clerical state. It is a separate act from ordination. The tonsure is performed only once, immediately prior to the actual ordination of a reader, which the ordination rite refers to as \\"the first degree of priesthood\\". However, it is not the means whereby a person becomes a reader. Readers, like subdeacons, are ordained by Cheirothesia - literally, \\"to place hands\\" - whereas Cheirotonia - \\"to stretch out the hands\\" - is practised at the ordination of the higher clergy: bishops, priests and deacons. It is through ordination - not the tonsure - that one is made a reader or subdeacon; this is highlighted by the fact that the tonsure is performed only once and is not repeated before the ordination of a subdeacon. The confusion has arisen by the common reference to a man being \\"tonsured a reader\\" which, while widespread, is not technically correct. The office of a reader subsumes that of a taper-bearer, and the service of ordaining a reader mentions both functions. The ordination of a reader in Finland. Readers are permitted to (and should in accordance with his particular church's practices) wear a cassock as a sign of his suppression of his own tastes, will, and desires, and his canonical obedience to God, his bishop, and the liturgical and canonical norms of the Church, although many do so only when attending services (again in accordance with particular church practices). Readers will generally not wear a clergy shirt, and may not perform any of the duties reserved for a deacon, priest or bishop. After being tonsured, the reader is vested in a short phelon, which he wears while reading the Epistle for the first time. This short phelon is then removed (and never worn thereafter) and replaced with a stikhar, which the reader wears thereafter whenever he performs his liturgical duties. This practice is not universal, however, and many bishops and priests will allow a reader to perform his function dressed only in a cassock or (if a monk) a riassa.http://www.kosovo.net/289_y.jpg Often, a bishop will decree what vesting practice he wishes to be followed within his own diocese; for an example, see holy-trinity.org, section VIII. Byzantine icons often show readers and church singers wearing a stikhar-like garment (more loose and flowing than the modern stikhar) and a pointed hat with the brim pulled out to the sides. This distinctive garb is now obsolete. In Eastern Thrace, during the Ottoman period and prior to the tragedy of 1922, some lay people were selected through symbolic tonsure and Cheirothesia to receive the ecclesiastical blessing and rank of not only because of their literacy but also in recognition of their philanthropic and benevolent patronage of the Church and Orthodoxy. Most adopted \\"ŒëŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœéœÉœÑŒ∑œÇ\\" (Anagnostis) as their given name, and this name was subsequently given as a baptismal name to their male grandchildren. Anglicanism Minor orders were discontinued in the reformed Church of England. The modern office of reader was introduced in 1866 and is distinct from the traditional minor order of reader. It is the office of a licensed lay minister and, for this reason, a person holding the office is referred to as a \\"lay reader\\" in many parts of the Anglican Communion. After a period of theological training (often, in the case of the Church of England, three years of evening classes), a lay person is licensed to preach and lead public worship. A reader is not a member of the clergy and cannot preside at the Eucharist, officiate at marriages, absolve or bless. A reader is licensed to lead non-sacramental worship (including, in some cases, funerals), may assist in the leadership of eucharistic worship and may preach. Anglican readers in some countries often wear a blue tippet with choir dress. Methodism In the United Methodist Church in the United States, similar to the Anglican office, a certified lay minister is a certified lay servant, certified lay missioner (or equivalent as defined by his or her central conference), who is called and equipped to conduct public worship, care for the congregation, assist in program leadership, develop new and existing faith communities, preach the Word, lead small groups, or establish community outreach ministries as part of a ministry team with the supervision and support of an ordained minister. The role of certified lay minister is intended for missional leadership in churches or other ministry settings as part of a team ministry under the supervision of clergy, and they are assigned to a local church by the district superintendent, unlike clergy who are appointed by a bishop.

They are medium-sized primates that live exclusively on Madagascar. The fur of the true lemurs is long and usually reddish brown. Often, sexual dimorphism in coloration (sexual dichromatism) is seen, such as in the black lemur. True lemurs are from in length, with a tail that is as long or significantly longer than the body. They weigh from . True lemurs are predominantly diurnal forest inhabitants, with some species preferring rain forests, while others live in dry forests. They are skillful climbers and can cross large distances in trees by jumping, using their nonprehensile tails to aid in balancing. When on the ground, they move almost exclusively on all four legs. True lemurs are social animals and live together in groups of two to 15 members. The diet of the true lemurs is almost exclusively herbivorous - flowers, fruits and leaves. In captivity, they have been shown to also eat insects. Gestation is 125 days. During the summer or early fall (shortly before the beginning of the rainy season), the females birth their young, usually two offspring. The young clasp firmly to the fur of their mother, then ride on her back when they are older. After about five months, they are weaned, and they are fully mature around 18 months of age. The life expectancy of the true lemurs can be up to 18 years, but this can be longer in captivity.

Ardbeg Distillery (Scottish Gaelic: Taigh-staile na h-√Äirde Bige) is a Scotch whisky distillery in Ardbeg on the south coast of the isle of Islay, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, in the Inner Hebrides group of islands. The distillery is owned by Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy, and produces a heavily peated Islay whisky. The distillery uses malted barley sourced from the maltings in Port Ellen. History of the distillery Ardbeg sign at distilleryThe Ardbeg distillery has been producing whisky since 1798, and began commercial production in 1815. Like most Scottish distilleries, for most of its history, its whisky was produced for use in blended whisky, rather than as a single malt. By 1886 the distillery produced 300,000 gallons of whisky per year, and employed 60 workers. Production was halted in 1981, but resumed on a limited basis in 1989 and continued at a low level through late 1996, during the period when Ardbeg was owned by Hiram Walker. In 1997 the distillery was bought and reopened by Glenmorangie plc (subsequently taken over by the French company LVMH on 28 December 2004) with production resuming on 25 June 1997 and full production resuming in 1998. The distillery was reopened by Ed Dodson in 1997 and handed over to Stuart Thomson, who managed it from 1997 to 2006. Michael \\"Mickey\\" Heads, an Islay native and former manager at Jura who had worked at Ardbeg years earlier, took over on 12 March 2007. The name Ardbeg is an anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic An √Äird Bheag, meaning The Small Promontory. Awards Ardbeg's offerings have garnered an array of awards at international spirit ratings competitions. For example: *Jim Murray's Whisky Bible 2008 awarded the Ten Years Old expression the title of 2008 World Whisky of the Year and Scotch Single Malt of the Year. The Ten Years Old also won a series of medals at the 2006-2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, winning two gold and six silver medals over that stretch. *Jim Murray's Whisky Bible 2009 and Whisky Bible 2010 awarded the Uigeadail expression the title of 2009 and 2010 World Whisky of the Year and Scotch Single Malt of the Year. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition awarded the Uigeadail two double gold, three gold, and two silver medals between 2006 and 2012. *Ardbeg Galileo won the World's Best Single Malt Whisky in the 2013 World Whiskies Awards. Production The distillery output is quite big for a distillery with only two pot stills. The wash still has a capacity of about 18,000 litres and the spirit still of about 17,000 litres. Currently a new still house is under construction which will double Ardbeg's distilling capacity. Ardbeg is one of the only Scottish distilleries who use a purifier, which leads to a smoother spirit. In 2011, 20 vials of Ardbeg spirit and wood particles were sent to the International Space Station to investigate their interaction. They returned on 12 September 2014.Ardbeg 'space whisky' back on Earth after flavour experiment BBC', 12 September 2014. Cultural references Ardbeg inspired the Finnish composer of contemporary music, Osmo Tapio R√§ih√§l√§, to write the symphonic poem Ardbeg‚ÄîThe Ultimate Piece For Orchestra (2003); it was recorded by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra on 28 April 2011.

He is probably best remembered for his performance in The Biscuit Eater. Lee's first role was in the Our Gang comedy short Mike Fright as a tap dancer in a sailor suit. He was signed under contract with Paramount Pictures from 1934 to 1941 and his first significant role was in Wagon Wheels when he was just four years old. Lee continued acting throughout the 1930s, appearing in a number of movies (among others: Too Many Parents, Easy to Take, Three Cheers for Love, The Silk Hat Kid, The Big Broadcast of 1937, Sons of the Legion, Say it in French, Boy Trouble, Night Work, Sudden Money, Nobody's Children, Hold Back the Dawn, Nevada City, The Road to Happiness) and working alongside some of Hollywood's finest, including, Donald O'Connor, Lon Chaney Jr., Roy Rogers, Charles Boyer, Randolph Scott, Lew Ayres, Gene Autry, Robert Cummings, Basil Rathbone, Olivia de Havilland, John Boles, Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland and Broderick Crawford).

In addition to being an actor, he was also a singer and dancer, appearing and singing with Bobby Breen in Make A Wish and touring with vaudeville shows. For his role in Cocoanut Grove he learnt to play the drums and formed the Billy Lee Band. The band appeared in the 1941 film, Reg'lar Fellers, in which he starred with co- star Carl Switzer. Lee retired from film in 1943 after his last film War Dogs. Lee died on November 17, 1989, of a sudden heart attack. References Bibliography * Holmstrom, John (1996).

He is one of the leading English-language scholars of German idealism. In addition to his writings on German idealism, Beiser has also written on the German Romantics and 19th-century British philosophy. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for his research in 1994, and was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2015. Early life and education Beiser was born on November 27, 1949, in Albert Lea, Minnesota. In 1971, Beiser received a bachelor's degree from Shimer College, a Great Books college then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. He then studied at the Oriel College of the University of Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, politics and economics in 1974. He subsequently studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1974 to 1975. Beiser earned his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford, in 1980, under the direction of Charles Taylor and Isaiah Berlin. His doctoral thesis was titled The Spirit of the Phenomenology: Hegel's Resurrection of Metaphysics in the Ph√§nomenologie des Geistes. Career After receiving his DPhil in 1980, Beiser moved to West Germany, where he was a Thyssen Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin. He returned to the United States four years later. He joined the University of Pennsylvania's faculty in 1984, staying there until 1985. He then spent the springs of 1986 and 1987 at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and University of Colorado Boulder, respectively. In 1987, Beiser released his first book, The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte (Harvard University Press). In the book, Beiser sought to reconstruct the background of German idealism through the narration of the story of the Spinoza or Pantheism controversy. Consequently, a great many figures, whose importance was hardly recognized by the English-speaking philosophers, were given their proper due. The work won the Thomas J. Wilson Memorial Prize for best first book. He has since edited two Cambridge anthologies on Hegel, The Cambridge Companion to Hegel (1993) and The Cambridge Companion to Hegel and Nineteenth-Century Philosophy (2008), and written a number of books on German philosophy and the English Enlightenment. He also edited The Early Political Writings of the German Romantics (Cambridge University Press) in 1996. In 1988, Beiser moved again to West Germany, where he was a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin. He returned to the United States in 1990 to take up a professorship at Indiana University Bloomington, where he remained until 2001. During his tenure at Indiana, he spent time teaching at Yale University. He joined Syracuse University in 2001, where he remains as of 2017. He also taught at Harvard University during the spring of 2002. Beiser is notable amongst English-language scholars for his defense of the metaphysical aspects of German idealism (e.g. Naturphilosophie), both in their centrality to any historical understanding of German idealism, as well as their continued relevance to contemporary philosophy.Beiser, Frederick. \\"Hegel and Naturphilosophie.\\" Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 34.1 (2003): 135-147.

FTPS should not be confused with the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), a secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol with which it is not compatible. It is also different from FTP over SSH, which is the practice of tunneling FTP through an SSH connection. Background The File Transfer Protocol was drafted in 1971 for use with the scientific and research network, ARPANET.RFC-265: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Access to the ARPANET during this time was limited to a small number of military sites and universities and a narrow community of users who could operate without data security and privacy requirements within the protocol. As the ARPANET gave way to the NSFnet and then the Internet, a broader population potentially had access to the data as it traversed increasingly longer paths from client to server. The opportunity for unauthorized third parties to eavesdrop on data transmissions increased proportionally. In 1994, the Internet browser company Netscape developed and released the application layer wrapper, Secure Sockets Layer.The SSL Protocol, Feb. 9th, 1995 This protocol enabled applications to communicate across a network in a private and secure fashion, discouraging eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. While it could add security to any protocol that uses reliable connections, such as TCP, it was most commonly used by Netscape with HTTP to form HTTPS. The SSL protocol was eventually applied to FTP, with a draft Request for Comments (RFC) published in late 1996.RFC draft, Secure FTP Over SSL, revision 1996-11-26 An official IANA port was registered shortly thereafter. However, the RFC was not finalized until 2005.RFC-4217: Securing FTP with TLS Methods of invoking security Two separate methods were developed to invoke client security for use with FTP clients: Implicit and Explicit. While the implicit method requires that a Transport Layer Security is established from the beginning of the connection, which in turn breaks the compatibility with non-FTPS-aware clients and servers, the explicit method uses standard FTP protocol commands and replies in order to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted one, allowing a single control port to be used for serving both FTPS-aware and non-FTPS-aware clients. =Implicit= Negotiation is not supported with implicit FTPS configurations. A client is immediately expected to challenge the FTPS server with a TLS ClientHello message. If such a message is not received by the FTPS server, the server should drop the connection. In order to maintain compatibility with existing non-FTPS-aware clients, implicit FTPS was expected to listen on the IANA well known port 990/TCP for the FTPS control channel, and port 989/TCP for the FTPS data channel. This allowed administrators to retain legacy-compatible services on the original 21/TCP FTP control channel. Note that implicit negotiation was not defined in RFC 4217. As such, it is considered an earlier, deprecated method of negotiating TLS/SSL for FTP. =Explicit= In explicit mode (also known as FTPES), an FTPS client must \\"explicitly request\\" security from an FTPS server and then step up to a mutually agreed encryption method. If a client does not request security, the FTPS server can either allow the client to continue in insecure mode or refuse the connection. The mechanism for negotiating authentication and security with FTP was added under RFC 2228, which included the new FTP command AUTH. While this RFC does not explicitly define any required security mechanisms, e.g. SSL or TLS, it does require the FTPS client to challenge the FTPS server with a mutually known mechanism. If the FTPS client challenges the FTPS server with an unknown security mechanism, the FTPS server will respond to the AUTH command with error code 504 (not supported). Clients may determine which mechanisms are supported by querying the FTPS server with the FEAT command, although servers are not necessarily required to be honest in disclosing what levels of security they support. Common methods of invoking FTPS security included AUTH TLS and AUTH SSL. The explicit method is defined in RFC 4217. In the later versions of the document, FTPS compliance required that clients always negotiate using the AUTH TLS method. Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Socket Layer (SSL) =General support= FTPS includes full support for the TLS and SSL cryptographic protocols, including the use of server-side public key authentication certificates and client-side authorization certificates. It also supports compatible ciphers, including AES, RC4, RC2, Triple DES, and DES. It further supports hash functions SHA, MD5, MD4, and MD2. =Scope of use= In implicit mode, the entire FTPS session is encrypted. Explicit mode differs in that the client has full control over what areas of the connection are to be encrypted. Enabling and disabling of encryption for the FTPS control channel and FTPS data channel can occur at any time. The only restriction comes from the FTPS server, which has the ability to deny commands based on server encryption policy. Secure command channel The secure command channel mode can be entered through the issue of either the AUTH TLS or AUTH SSL commands. After such time, all command control between the FTPS client and server are assumed to be encrypted. It is generally advised to enter such a state prior to user authentication and authorization in order to avoid the eavesdropping of user name and password data by third parties. Secure data channel The secure data channel can be entered through the issue of the PROT command. It is not enabled by default when the AUTH TLS command is issued. After such time, all data channel communication between the FTPS client and server is assumed to be encrypted. The FTPS client may exit the secure data channel mode at any time by issuing a CDC (clear data channel) command. Reasons to disable encryption It may not be advantageous to use data channel encryption when performing transfers under the following scenarios: * Files being transferred are of a non-sensitive nature, making encryption unnecessary, * Files being transferred are already encrypted at the file level or are passing over an encrypted VPN, making encryption redundant, * Available TLS or SSL encryption modes do not meet desired level of encryption. This is common with older FTPS clients or servers that may have been limited to 40-bit SSL due to previous United States high-encryption export laws. It may not be advantageous to use control channel encryption under the following scenarios: * Use of FTPS when the client or server reside behind a network firewall or network address translation (NAT) device. (See Firewall Incompatibilities below.) * Repeated use of AUTH and CCC/CDC commands by anonymous FTP clients within the same session. Such behavior can be used as a resource-based denial of service attack as the TLS/SSL session must be regenerated each time, using server processor time. SSL certificates Much like HTTPS, FTPS servers must provide a public key certificate. These certificates can be requested and created using tools such as OpenSSL. When these certificates are signed by a trusted certificate authority, this provides assurance that the client is connected to the requested server, avoiding a man-in-the-middle attack. If the certificate is not signed by a trusted CA (a self-signed certificate), the FTPS client may generate a warning stating that the certificate is not valid. The client can choose to accept the certificate or reject the connection. This is in contrast to the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), which does not present signed certificates, but instead relies on Out-of-band authentication of public keys. Firewall incompatibilities Because FTP uses a dynamic secondary port (for data channels), many firewalls were designed to snoop FTP protocol control messages in order to determine which secondary data connections they need to allow. However, if the FTP control connection is encrypted using TLS/SSL, the firewall cannot determine the TCP port number of a data connection negotiated between the client and FTP server. Therefore, in many firewalled networks, an FTPS deployment will fail when an unencrypted FTP deployment will work. This problem can be solved with the use of a limited range of ports for data and configuring the firewall to open these ports.

Afterward, he became the Mayor of Elizabethtown, New Jersey as well as served in the New Jersey General Assembly.Appleton's Cyclopedia vol. II, p. 113 Early and family life Dayton was born in Elizabeth, Union County, New Jersey. He married Hannah Rolfe in 1757 and they had sons Jonathan Dayton (1760-1824; who would become the youngest signatory of the U.S. Constitution) and Elias Bayley Dayton (1764-1846). Career During the French and Indian War, Dayton served first as a lieutenant and then as a captain in the New Jersey militia. During Pontiac's War, in 1760, he served as a commander in the Detroit region. After the wars, Dayton returned to Elizabethtown, New Jersey, where he became a mechanic, merchant and colonial official. In 1774 the First Continental Congress called on the colonies to resist Parliament's recent tax policy by joining in an association to boycott goods imported from Britain. Dayton allied himself with the local revolutionary movement and served on Elizabethtown's enforcement committee. When the state turned against Royal Governor William Franklin in 1775, the New Jersey's Provincial Congress chose Dayton to lead the 3rd New Jersey Regiment. In July 1775 he and William Alexander, Lord Stirling, led militia forces which captured a British transport off Elizabethtown. In the spring of 1776 Dayton (as colonel) and his 3rd New Jersey troops (including his young son Jonathan, who would become the regimental paymaster by August) were sent to support an invasion of Canada. However, they were diverted to New York's Mohawk Valley where Colonel Dayton constructed fortifications to protect the colonists from Loyalist and Indian insurrections. These fortifications included Fort Dayton in what is now Herkimer, New York and Fort Schuyler (formerly Fort Stanwix but allowed to go to ruin after the French and Indian War) in what is now Rome, New York. In 1777, Dayton set up a spy network for George Washington on Staten Island to work in parallel with an established American intelligence agent, John Mersereau.Mahoney, Henry Thayer and Marjorie Locke Mahoney.

In December 1778, New Jersey named Dayton as a delegate to the Continental Congress, but he remained with the army and did not attend the Congress. He helped suppress a mutiny of the New Jersey line in 1781, and was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army in 1783, and later to major general of militia. He had a prominent role in the battles of Springfield, Monmouth, Brandywine and Yorktown, and had horses shot under him at Germantown (outside Philadelphia), at Springfield, and at Crosswick's Bridge. He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1791‚Äì1792 and 1794‚Äì1796, and was mayor of Elizabethtown from 1796-1805. He was also president of the New Jersey Society of the Cincinnati from its foundation until his death. Death and legacy He died at age 70 and was interred at the First Presbyterian Churchyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey.findagave no. 4824 The city of Dayton, Ohio would be named after his son Jonathan Dayton.

Archived from the original on February 21, 2019. was an American cartoonist and illustrator known for his intricately detailed grotesques of bizarre or misshapen people. Wolverton was described as \\"Producer of Preposterous Pictures of Peculiar People who Prowl this Perplexing Planet.\\" His many publishers included Marvel Comics and Mad magazine. His drawings have elicited a wide range of reactions. Cartoonist Will Elder said he found Wolverton's technique \\"outrageously inventive, defying every conventional standard yet upholding a very unusual sense of humor. He was a refreshing original.\\" But Jules Feiffer stated, \\"I don't like his work. I think it's ugly.\\"Both quotes from Wolvertoons: The Art of Basil Wolverton, edited by Dick Voll. (Fantagraphics Books, 1990) , He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1991. Biography =Early life and career= Wolverton as a senior in high school, 1927. Target Comics v3 7, art by Basil Wolverton, September 1942. Born in Central Point, Oregon, he later moved to Vancouver, Washington, and worked as a vaudeville performer and a cartoonist and reporter for the Portland News. At age 16 he sold his first nationally published work and began pitching comic strips to newspaper syndicates. His comic strip, Marco of Mars, was accepted by the Independent Syndicate of New York in 1929 but never distributed because it was deemed too similar to Buck Rogers, which debuted that year. Disk-Eyes the Detective and Spacehawks were published in 1938 in Circus comics. In 1940, Spacehawk (a different and improved feature) made its debut in Target Comics , published by Novelty Press. It ran for 30 episodes (262 pages) until 1942. Other Wolverton characters include Scoop Scuttle, a newspaperman who ran as a backup feature in Lev Gleason Publications' Daredevil Comics and Silver Streak Comics; and Mystic Moot and his Magic Snoot in Fawcett Publications' Comic Comics and Ibis The Invincible. \\"Bingbang Buster and his Horse Hedy\\" was a three-page backup story in Lev Gleason's Black Diamond Western #16‚Äì28 (1950‚Äì1952). =Powerhouse Pepper and Lena the Hyena= Wolverton's humor feature Powerhouse Pepper, about a superstrong if none-too-bright boxer, appeared in various comic books published by Timely Comics, the 1930s and 1940s precursor of Marvel Comics, from 1942 through 1952. The strip was characterized by alliterative, rhyming dialogue, screwball comedy and throwaway gags in background. The Timely titles, such as Joker Comics, Gay Comics and Tessie the Typist, debuted a number of his spin-off characters and features, including Flap Flipflop, The Flying Flash (who later appeared in Charlton Comics' Jack in the Box #13), Leanbean Green, \\"Cartoon Crime Mystery\\" featuring Inspector Hector the Crime Detector, Doc Rockblock, \\"Picture Poems about Peculiar People\\", \\"Funny Boners\\", Dauntless Dawson, \\"Hothead Hotel\\", \\"Bedtime Bunk\\", \\"Foolish Faces\\" and more. Five issues of a Powerhouse Pepper comic book were released in 1943 and 1948 by Timely, but not all the covers were by Wolverton and many interior pages were also not devoted to Wolverton strips. Li'l Abner daily strip by Al Capp, introducing Basil Wolverton's \\"Lena the Hyena\\" In 1946, Wolverton won a contest to depict \\"Lena the Hyena\\", the world's ugliest woman, a running gag in Al Capp's Li'l Abner newspaper strip where Lena remained unseen beneath an editorial note stating her face had been covered to protect readers. Capp, responding to popular demand, announced a contest for artists to submit their interpretations. Among 500,000 entries, Wolverton's was the winner;Lee, Stan. Secrets Behind the Comics (Famous Enterprises, 1947), p. 81. it appeared in a Li'l Abner daily and Life magazine. Wolverton's fame briefly led to Life and Pageant printing his caricatures. The Lena portrait typified the unique \\"spaghetti and meatballs\\" style he employed regularly thereafter. In the 1950s, Wolverton produced 17 comic-book horror and science-fiction stories for Marvel and other comic-book publishers, including one story by author Daniel Keyes, which led to him being \\"hailed for creating uniquely grotesque monsters\\".Stanley, John. \\"Comics That Draw Gasps, Not Smiles\\", San Francisco Chronicle, Sunday, September 25, 2005, pp. [???] ‚Äì 24. Among these tales were \\"The Brain Bats of Venus\\" for Mister Mystery #7 and \\"Where Monsters Dwell\\" in Marvel's Adventures into Terror #7, the title of which was later used for a 1970s Marvel reprint series. =Mad= Wolverton first appeared in Mad with a single panel in #10, drew Mad Reader! for #11 and also contributed an iconic Lena-like image to the cover of #11, which was billed as the \\"Beautiful Girl of the Month\\". Although Wolverton contributed sporadically to the title‚Äîappearing in just nine issues over two decades‚Äîhis work was memorable enough that, in 2009, The New York Times dubbed him \\"The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine\\".\\"The Michelangelo of Mad Magazine\\" (slideshow), The New York Times, n.d. E.C.'s other humor title, Panic, edited by Al Feldstein (who later became Mad's editor for 30 years) also used Wolverton's art on a Panic cover, though publisher William M. Gaines was not a fan of Wolverton's work. Other humor magazines from other companies such as Cracked, From Here to Insanity and Cockeyed also featured Wolverton's work, as did an issue of Ballyhoo. =Later career= In 1968, Wolverton did the Ugly Posters series of trading cards for Topps, displaying his trademark twisted headshots. In 1973, he returned to mainstream comics, illustrating several covers for Joe Orlando's satiric Plop! at DC Comics. Comix Book, a joint production of Marvel Comics and Denis Kitchen's Kitchen Sink Press, featured two strips by Wolverton, \\"Calvin\\" and \\"Weird Creatures\\". Personal life In 1934, Wolverton married his Vancouver High School classmate Honor Lovette (class of 1927). They remained married until his death. Wolverton was baptized into Herbert W. Armstrong's Radio Church of God in 1941 and was ordained as an elder in 1943. As a board member of that church, he was one of the six people, including Armstrong and his wife, who reincorporated the church in 1946 when it moved from its original headquarters in Oregon to California. Wolverton died on December 31, 1978, at age 69. Wolverton's son, editorial cartoonist Monte Wolverton, draws in a style similar to his father's; the younger Wolverton also worked for The Plain Truth and contributed to Mad. Several cartoonists have been influenced by Wolverton's \\"spaghetti-and-meatball\\" style, including Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth.

The character is depicted as an adversary of the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and writer/illustrator Jim Lee, he first appeared in X-Men #1 (October 1991). Fictional character biography =Acolytes= Thought to be royalty from Spain, Fabian Cortez organizes the original Acolytes, who pledge themselves to Magneto and his cause. Cortez then goads and manipulates Magneto into combat with humanity and the X-Men at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto's space- station, Asteroid M, and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez's own sister Anne Marie.X-Men (vol. 2) #1 Cortez recruits a group of Acolytes who, believing Magneto to be dead and martyred for his cause, now worship him as their god, to follow Cortez in Magneto's name.Uncanny X-Men 300 They launch several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new Sentinels are being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital,.X-Factor (vol 1) #92 Magneto eventually resurfaces, sending his chosen heir Exodus to inform the Acolytes of Cortez's betrayal. The Acolytes welcome Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez is left behind.Uncanny X-Men #304 =Bloodties= Fearing Magneto's wrath, Cortez flees to Genosha. Still claiming to speak in Magneto's name, he incites the nation's mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world's first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter Luna, intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the Avengers. Cortez is unaware that Magneto had recently been mindwiped by Charles Xavier, and Exodus comes to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.Avengers Vol. 1 #369 =Back with the Acolytes= Cortez reappears months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulates Joseph into posing as Magneto,Magneto #1 (1996) pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme's failure, he is allowed to return to the team. Months later, at a time when Exodus had briefly been imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez leads one group, but they abandon him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he has been using them for his own purposes. =Dark Seduction= Alone again, Cortez is surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, whom the United Nations has given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Fabian Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto only lets Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his powers have been reduced and Cortez's mutant power is to heighten the abilities of other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto's UN advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto is restored to full power by one of the Genengineer's machines and as he no longer needs Cortez, pulls him from a prison in Hammer Bay, to over fifty miles away to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact kills Cortez instantly, as he splattered on the ground at Magneto's feet. Just before his death, a connection between Cortez and the geneticist Mister Sinister was implied which would explain how Cortez returned alive and well when everyone believed him dead by the hands of Exodus.\\"Magneto: Dark Seduction\\" #1-4 (2000) = Necrosha = After the X-Men form Utopia, Magneto joins them, saying he supports their efforts.Uncanny X-Men #516 Selene especially wants Magneto captured for his collaboration with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. She has three of her recently resurrected mind-controlled soldiers‚ÄîAcolytes Cortez, Delgado, and Mellencamp‚Äîhunt down Magneto. They try to torture Loa to get the information out of her, but when she tries to hide in her room she finds Deadpool inside it. Deadpool battles the trio, but the techno-organic virus that is inside the Acolytes (which caused their resurrection) prevent him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabs Loa by the throat and demands to know Magneto's location, saying that even though Selene wants Magneto alive he will fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begs Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez does not believe possible. Deadpool knocks Loa out of Cortez's hands, but then is overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa uses her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, mutilating him. Deadpool, seeing that Loa's powers were able to slay Selene's minions, forces her to kill Cortez and Delgado too by throwing her into them (to survive, she has to slide through them, which causes them to crumble). Deadpool then tells Cyclops that he should not be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.X-Force Annual #1 The techno-organic virus however appears to reform Fabian Cortez, as he resurfaced later along fellow Upstarts members Shinobi Shaw, Siena Blaze and Trevor Fitzroy, and started the game that they created long ago. They killed members of the Nasty Boys in order to lure out Cyclops and his ragtag team of X-Men to Washington Heights. After a brief moment of words, the two groups engaged each other in battle. The X-Men gained the upperhand as the Upstarts retreated but Shinobi was left behind, only to kill himself as he didn't wanted to get captured or be controlled by the Hellfire Club.Uncanny X-Men (Vol. 5) #21 Powers and abilities Fabian Cortez possesses a unique mutation which grants him the ability to enhance or diminish energy levels. In the cases of mutants, he can enhance their abilities to occasionally to very dangerous levels and limits of which may exceed the normal limits of the targets' control; temporarily empowering them at the expense of the targets' health. Thus, burning out the targeted subjects physical bodies, sometimes on the molecular level. In X-Men #1 (1991), while on board Asteroid M, Magneto returned from a fight with the X-Men having suffered deep lacerations to his lower abdomen from Wolverine's claws. Cortez seemingly \\"healed\\" Magneto, as he said he had also done with his sister after an earlier battle. These actions temporarily restored Magneto back to full health and vitality. However, these actions turned out to be a false as the effects on Magneto were needed frequently to sustain the \\"healing\\" effects by Cortez. Whether this was an offshoot of Fabian Cortez's main powers, a display of \\"controlled power boosting\\", or demonstrations of an ability to \\"trigger\\" a mutant's own natural healing abilities is not known. This ability was not used much or at all in his later history. Additionally, it has not been clarified if his power affects human bio-energy or other natural occurring energy in the same manner. Cortez could also use his powers to interpret and sense the genetic code of living beings and unique bioenergy signatures and energy fields in other mutants. Likewise, he may also have had some control over his own energy field along with possibly being able to constrict it around a target, various targets and foes. Cortez is also a skilled martial artist and often carries a firearm. It has not been yet clarified if his skill sets are rooted in a previous military background, resulting in advanced tactical expertise. Still, he is noteworthy to mention that he is highly intelligent, tactical, and a formidable military strategist.

There have in fact been eight separate Concorde Agreements, all of whose terms were kept strictly secret: The first in 1981, others in 1987, 1992, 1997, 1998, 2009, 2013 and the current agreement for 2021. However, the secrecy was broken by noted racing journalist Forrest Bond when the 120+ page 1997 Concorde Agreement was published at the end of 2005 by RaceFax. The effect of the agreements is to encourage professionalism and to increase the commercial success of Formula One. The most important factor in achieving this was the obligation of the teams to participate in every race, hence making the sport more reliable for broadcasters who were expected to invest heavily to acquire television broadcast rights. In return the teams were guaranteed a percentage of the sport's commercial revenue. First Concorde Agreement (1981) In 1979, the Commission Sportive Internationale, an organization subordinate to the FIA which was at that time the rule-making body for Formula One, was dissolved and replaced by the F√©d√©ration Internationale du Sport Automobile, or FISA, which would serve the same function. FISA clashed repeatedly with the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), which represented the teams' interests. FOCA's chief executive at the time was Bernie Ecclestone and his legal advisor was Max Mosley, while the president of FISA was Jean Marie Balestre. The two organizations' disagreements, which came to be known as the FISA‚ÄìFOCA war, resulted in several races being cancelled. Goodyear threatened to withdraw entirely from Formula One, an event which would have been commercially disastrous for the sport, so Ecclestone organized a meeting of team managers, Balestre, and other FISA representatives at the offices of the FIA in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, France. On 19 January 1981, after thirteen straight hours of negotiation, all parties present signed the first Concorde Agreement, named after the plaza in Paris where the discussions took place. The contract's terms remain largely confidential, though its known stipulations required the signatory teams to appear and compete in every race and guaranteed their right to do so in order to assure the sport's newly acquired television public that they would have a race to watch. Also, perhaps most importantly, the agreement granted FOCA the right to televise Formula One races -- this right was \\"leased\\" to Formula One Promotions and Administration, a company established and owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Another important element was the stability in rules, described as protecting the teams from \\"the whims of the governing body\\". It expired on 31 December 1987. Second Concorde Agreement (1987) The second Concorde Agreement governed the to seasons inclusive. Third Concorde Agreement (1992) The third Concorde Agreement covered the to seasons. Fourth Concorde Agreement (1997) In 1995 the FIA decided to transfer Formula One's commercial rights from FOCA to Formula One Administration for a 14-year period. In exchange, Ecclestone would provide an annual payment. McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell protested by rejecting the proposed Concorde Agreement (negotiations for which started as early as 1993). Ken Tyrrell in particular was enraged by the fact that Ecclestone, as President of FOCA had negotiated the transfer of the rights from the organization to his own company. Tyrrell also objected to the addendum to the Agreement being secret, arguing that secrecy surrounding the agreement benefited only Ecclestone (by weakening the bargaining power of the other parties). The three teams refused to sign the proposed Concorde Agreement, initially with the support of the remaining teams. However, on 5 September 1996 the new Concorde Agreement was signed by all the teams except McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell. The agreement was to run from 1 January 1997 to 2002. Fifth Concorde Agreement (1998) By taking a stand against the actions of Bernie Ecclestone, the FIA and the wider commercial aspects of Formula One, McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell lost both influence in the sport and income which they would have received as signatories. A compromise was reached and on 27 August 1998, the 1998 Concorde Agreement was signed which accommodated the three teams and which expired on 31 December 2007. Sixth Concorde Agreement (2009) On 7 December 2004, at a meeting attended by the bosses of all the teams but Ferrari, Ecclestone offered a payout of ¬£260,000,000 over three years in return for unanimous renewal of the Concorde Agreement, which would guarantee the continuation of Formula One in its present form at least until the expiration of that contract. On 19 January 2005, Ferrari announced that it had signed an extension to the previous agreement to expire on 31 December 2012. On 18 July 2005, Red Bull also signed an extension, as did Jordan/Midland two days later. On 7 December 2005, Williams became the fourth team to sign an extension to the agreement. On 27 March 2006, the five Grand Prix Manufacturers Association-backed teams - BMW Sauber, Renault, Honda, McLaren and Toyota - submitted their applications for the 2008 season, agreeing to stay in the sport until 2012. On 14 May 2006, the five GPMA-backed teams signed a memorandum of understanding with the commercial rightsholders (CVC/Ecclestone) which formed the basis of the next Concorde Agreement. As such, a full Concorde Agreement was not in place for the season, with the Memorandum, extensions and agreements with the other individual teams acting as a stop-gap solution. On 29 July 2008, the ten currently competing teams created the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) to negotiate the terms of contract. After a dispute between FOTA and the FIA in the first half of 2009, a new Concorde Agreement was signed by Mosley and all of the teams, although Sauber, in transition as majority owner of BMW, had announced, shortly beforehand, its intention of withdrawing from the sport at the end of the season, so waited until a controlling stake of the team was returned to Peter Sauber before signing. The new agreement provides for a continuation of the terms of the 1998 agreement, and runs until 31 December 2012. At the same meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, a programme of resource restriction was also agreed upon, as were a revised set of sporting and technical regulations for the season. Seventh Concorde Agreement (2013)  After an extended period of negotiations, a new Concorde Agreement was signed in July 2013 and entered force on 27 September 2013. It expires on 31 December 2020. Eighth Concorde Agreement (2021) Negotiations over the terms to replace the 2013 agreement began as part of wider discussions over the future of the sport in 2017, however a deadline to reach a deal was extended until 31 October 2019. The Agreement was reported to be nearing completion in January 2020., however was ultimately delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix weekend, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff declared his dissatisfaction with the terms of the new agreement, which was to introduce a budget cap from the season and change the prize money distribution. Wolff believed that his team would be affected most negatively. In response, the deadline for signing the agreement, previously set for 12 August, was moved back a week. However, after discussions with Chase Carey, Wolff changed stance and declared his willingness to sign the new agreement. The new Concorde Agreement seeks to protect the value of the incumbent teams, by requiring new entrants to pay 200 million dollars, shared equally among 10 existing teams, in exchange for having the right of revenue share on its first year of competition. Previously, new entries only have the prize only from its second year of competition. On 18 August 2020, Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams announced that they had signed the new Concorde Agreement, whilst the following day Formula One announced that the other teams had also signed the agreement. The new agreement, which is the first to made under new owners Liberty Media, will cover the to seasons, and will come into force on 1 January 2021.

Early life Schwarz was born in Weehawken, New Jersey, to Jewish parents. His parents were both physicians and took him to concerts and opera performances. Schwarz began his trumpet career at age 8. By 12 years of age, he dedicated his life to becoming a musician. He graduated from New York City's High School of Performing Arts and Juilliard School of Music and began his musical career as a trumpeter, performing until 1973 as principal of the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Boulez. He began conducting in 1966. Schwarz champions American composers, past and present. He has made more than 100 recordings with the Seattle Symphony including many American works. In particular, he won acclaim for his recordings of symphonies and orchestral works by Walter Piston, Howard Hanson, William Schuman, Alan Hovhaness, and David Diamond. Schwarz built the strength of the Seattle Symphony. In 1983 it had 5,000 subscribers; as of 2008 it had 35,000.Seattle Times article on 2008-09-10 He spearheaded the effort to build Benaroya Hall for the symphony. However, his leadership style of the Seattle Symphony was controversial among some musicians. A portrait painting of Schwarz by artist Michele Rushworth was unveiled and installed at Benaroya Hall in 2011. Career In 1971 he won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. He frequently held multiple positions simultaneously. He was music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra from 1978 to 1986. He served as music director of New York's Mostly Mozart Festival from 1982 to 2001. He was the music director of the Seattle Symphony from 1985 to 2011.

Areas shown in black and red delineate areas of severe and moderate habitat loss, respectively. Habitat fragmentation describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred environment (habitat), causing population fragmentation and ecosystem decay. Causes of habitat fragmentation include geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment (suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation), and human activity such as land conversion, which can alter the environment much faster and causes the extinction of many species. More specifically, habitat fragmentation is a process by which large and contiguous habitats get divided into smaller, isolated patches of habitats . Deforestation and increased road-building in the Amazon Rainforest are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource-extraction and further threats to biodiversity. Definition The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena: * Reduction in the total area of the habitat * Decrease of the interior: edge ratio * Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat * Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches * Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat \\"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat\\" (van den Berg et al. 2001). Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation, and population size. Biol.But of this is fake. In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term \\"habitat fragmentation\\" applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of \\"habitat fragmentation\\" per se would refer to the loss of habitat area as \\"habitat loss\\" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat. Furthermore, habitat fragmentation is considered as an invasive threat to biodiversity, due to its implications of affecting large number of species than biological invasions, overexploitation, or pollution (Haddad et al. 2015). Additionally, the effects of habitat fragmentation damage the ability for species, such as native plants, to be able to effectively adapt to their changing environments. Ultimately, this prevents gene flow from one generation of population to the next, especially for species living in smaller population sizes. Whereas, for species of larger populations have more genetic mutations which can arise and genetic recombination impacts which can increase species survival in those environments. Overall, habitat fragmentation results in habitat disintegration and habitat loss which both tie into destructing biodiversity as a whole.  Causes  =Natural causes= Evidence of habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, fire, and climate change is found in the fossil record. For example, habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles. =Human causes= Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when native plants is cleared for human activities such as agriculture, rural development, urbanization and the creation of hydroelectric reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of slash and burn farming in tropical forests. In the wheat belt of central-western New South Wales, Australia, 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the tall grass prairie of North America has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation. = Endogenous vs. exogenous = There are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous is a process that develops as a part of species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior, and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to a decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation. Implications  = Habitat and biodiversity loss = One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both habitat destruction and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat. Plants and other sessile organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat. Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species. But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se), has been suggested to be small. A review of empirical studies found that, of the 381 reported significant effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species occurrences, abundances or diversity in the scientific literature, 76% were positive whereas 24% were negative. Despite these results, the scientific literature tends to emphasize negative effects more than positive effects.Fahrig, L. (2018) Forty years of biais in habitat fragmentation research, In: Effective Conservation Science: Data Not Dogma (Edited by Kareiva, Marvier and Silliman), Oxford University Press, United Kingdom Positive effects of habitat fragmentation per se imply that several small patches of habitat can have higher conservation value than a single large patch of equivalent size. Land sharing strategies could therefore have more positive impacts on species than land sparing strategies.Habitat fragmented by numerous roads near the Indiana Dunes National Park. Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features. Minor fluctuations in climate, resources, or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction. Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary asynchronously. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be \\"rescued\\" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of immigrants by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the Columbia spotted frog are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival. Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to edge effects. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature, and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. Fires become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species that require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation. Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% biodiversity loss.Quammen, David (1997), \\"The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction\\" (Scribner) Much of the remaining terrestrial wildlife habitat in many third world countries has experienced fragmentation through the development of urban expansion such as roads interfering with habitat loss. Aquatic species‚Äô habitats have been fragmented by dams and water diversions. These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes. =Informed conservation= Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming threatened or endangered. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases, the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible contiguous piece of land. In rare cases, a conservation reliant species may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats, and when controlled for overall habitat loss some studies have shown a positive relationship between species richness and fragmentation; this phenomenon has been called the habitat amount hypothesis, though the validity of this claim has been disputed. The ongoing debate of what size fragments are most relevant for conservation is often referred to as SLOSS (Single Large or Several Small). One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting corridors of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments. This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat. Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore. The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of metapopulations island biogeography. = Genetic risks = As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species. Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long- term survival. Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the genetic diversity found in the previously continuous habitat. In these cases, processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity, such as adaptation, have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change. However in some scenarios, where subsets of genetic diversity are partitioned among multiple habitat fragments, almost all original genetic diversity can be maintained despite each individual fragment displaying a reduced subset of diversity.  Gene Flow and Inbreeding  Gene flow occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through migration. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration are typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation, most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation. Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in inbreeding between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called inbreeding depression. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of homozygosity increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow. Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.  Genetic drift  Small populations are more susceptible to genetic drift. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic makeup of populations and leads to reductions in genetic diversity.The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations. However, research suggests that some tree species may be resilient to the negative consequences of genetic drift until population size is as small as ten individuals or less. = Genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation for plant populations = Habitat fragmentation decreases the size and increases plant populations' spatial isolation. With genetic variation and increased methods of inter-population genetic divergence due to increased effects of random genetic drift, elevating inbreeding and reducing gene flow within plant species. While genetic variation may decrease with remnant population size, not all fragmentation events lead to genetic losses and different types of genetic variation. Rarely, fragmentation can also increase gene flow among remnant populations, breaking down local genetic structure.  Adaptation  In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation. However, there are also many cases where fragmentation reduces adaptation capacity because of small population size.  Examples of impacted species  Some species that have experienced genetic consequences due to habitat fragmentation are listed below: Macquarie perch * Macquaria australasica *Fagus sylvatica *Betula nana *Rhinella ornata *Ochotona princeps *Uta stansburiana *Plestiodon skiltonianus *Sceloporus occidentalis *Chamaea fasciata = Effect on animal behaviours= Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species' behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions can determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result, alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator-prey relationships. In addition, when animals happen to venture into unknown areas in between fragmented forests or landscapes, they can supposedly come into contact with humans which puts them at a great risk and further decreases their chances of survival.  Predation behaviours  Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the number of species and the members of those species. This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so- called \\"behavioral space race\\". The way in which fragmentation changes and re- shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are a refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to species extinction. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging. = Boreal woodland caribous = In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia, the effects of fragmentation are demonstrated. The species refuge area is peatland bog which has been interrupted by linear features such as roads and pipelines. These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf, and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land. Since their predators can more easily access the caribous' refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced.  Communication behaviours  Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont's Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which uses songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song, and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory. A large song repertoire can enhance a male's ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted. Fragmentation of the Dupont's Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match. Humans have also brought on varying implications into ecosystems which in turn affect animal behaviour and responses generated. Although there are some species which are able to survive these kinds of harsh conditions, such as, cutting down wood in the forests for pulp and paper industries, there are animals which can survive this change but some that cannot. An example includes, varying aquatic insects are able to identify appropriate ponds to lay their eggs with the aid of polarized light to guide them, however, due to ecosystem modifications caused by humans they are led onto artificial structures which emit artificial light which are induced by dry asphalt dry roads for an example. = Effect on microorganisms = While habitat fragmentation is often associated with its effects on large plant and animal populations and biodiversity, due to the interconnectedness of ecosystems there are also significant effects that it has on the microbiota of an environment. Increased fragmentation has been linked to reduced populations and diversity of fungi responsible for decomposition, as well as the insects they are host to. This has been linked to simplified food webs in highly fragmented areas compared to old growth forests. Furthermore, edge effects have been shown to result in significantly varied microenvironments compared to interior forest due to variations in light availability, presence of wind, changes in precipitation, and overall moisture content of leaf litter. These microenvironments are often not conducive to overall forest health as they enable generalist species to thrive at the expense of specialists that depend on specific environments.  Forest fragmentation  Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants. The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, farmland, or developed areas. Following the principles of island biogeography, remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of ecosystem decay. Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States. Utility ROWs include electricity transmission ROWs, gas pipeline and telecommunication ROWs. Electricity transmission ROWs are created to prevent vegetation interference with transmission lines. Some studies have shown that electricity transmission ROWs harbor more plant species than adjoining forest areas, due to alterations in the microclimate in and around the corridor. Discontinuities in forest areas associated with utility right-of-ways can serve as biodiversity havens for native bees and grassland species, as the right-of-ways are preserved in an early successional stage. Forest fragmentation reduces food resources and habitat sources for animals thus splitting these species apart. Thus, making these animals become much more susceptible to effects of predation and making them less likely to perform interbreeding - lowering genetic diversity. = Implications = Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity in forests, especially in the tropics. The problem of habitat destruction that caused the fragmentation in the first place is compounded by: * the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates * the local extinction of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population * edge effects that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat. The effect of fragmentation on the flora and fauna of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation. Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas. For example, if a cleared area is reforested or allowed to regenerate, the increasing structural diversity of the vegetation will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments. However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated. Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated. A large number of small forest \\"islands\\" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity., Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp. McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada released a university based newspaper statement stating that 70% of the world‚Äôs remaining forest stands within one kilometre of a forest edge putting biodiversity at an immense risk based on research conducted by international scientists. Reduced fragment area, increased isolation, and increased edge initiate changes that percolate through all ecosystems. Habitat fragmentation is able to formulate persistent outcomes which can also become unexpected such as an abundance of some species and the pattern that long temporal scales are required to discern many strong system responses. = Sustainable forest management = The presence of forest fragments influences the supply of various ecosystems in adjacent agricultural fields (Mitchell et al. 2014). Mitchell et al (2014), researched on six varying ecosystem factors such as crop production, decomposition, pesticide regulation, carbon storage, soil fertility, and water quality regulation in soybean fields through separate distances by nearby forest fragments which all varied in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada. Sustainable forest management can be achieved in several ways including by managing forests for ecosystem services (beyond simple provisioning), through government compensation schemes, and through effective regulation and legal frameworks. The only realistic method of conserving forests is to apply and practice sustainable forest management to risk further loss. There is a high industrial demand for wood, pulp, paper, and other resources which the forest can provide with, thus businesses which will want more access to the cutting of forests to gain those resources. The rainforest alliance has efficiently been able to put into place an approach to sustainable forest management, and they established this in the late 1980s. Their conservation was deemed successful as it has saved over nearly half a billion acres of land around the world. A few approaches and measures which can be taken in order to conserve forests are methods by which erosion can be minimized, waste is properly disposed, conserve native tree species to maintain genetic diversity, and setting aside forestland (provides habitat for critical wildlife species). Additionally, forest fires can also occur frequently and measures can also be taken to further prevent forest fires from occurring. For example, in Guatemala‚Äôs culturally and ecologically significant Pet√©n region, researchers were able to find over a 20-year period, actively managed FSC-certified forests experienced substantially lower rates of deforestation than nearby protected areas, and forest fires only affected 0.1 percent of certified land area, compared to 10.4 percent of protected areas. However, it must be duly noted that short term decisions regarding forest sector employment and harvest practices can have long-term effects on biodiversity. Planted forests become increasingly important as they supply approximately a quarter of global industrial roundwood production and are predicted to account for 50% of global output within two decades (Brown,1998; Jaakko Poyry,1999). Although there have been many difficulties, the implementation of forest certification has been quite prominent in being able to raise effective awareness and disseminating knowledge on a holistic concept, embracing economic, environmental and social issues, worldwide. While also providing a tool for a range of other applications than assessment of sustainability, such as e.g. verifying carbon sinks.  Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation  Two approaches are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts. = Species-oriented approach = The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it. This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.  Pattern-oriented approach  The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by Richard Forman The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from island biogeography and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.Fischer, Joern & B. Lindenmayer, David. (2007). Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 16. 265-280. 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.  Variegation Model  The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that is often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.

These medium- sized primates live exclusively on Madagascar. The greater bamboo lemur, formerly known as Hapalemur simus, was considered part of this genus, but is now classified as belonging to the genus Prolemur. Etymology Bamboo lemurs were first described by French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1851. Comparing their small size, proportions, speckled fur, and other traits to those of marmosets‚Äîthen classified in the genus Hapale‚Äîhe named the genus Hapalemur. Hapale derives from the Greek word Œ±œÄŒ±ŒªœåœÇ (hapalos), meaning \\"gentle\\". In their discussion of lemur name etymologies, Dunkel et al. speculated that the once popular vernacular name for the genus, \\"gentle lemur\\", derived from the translation of Hapalemur, despite their notoriety for being one of the most aggressive lemurs in captivity‚Äîan observation first noted in a letter by Dutch naturalist Fran√ßois Pollen published in 1895. More recently, the common name \\"bamboo lemur\\" (often used for both Hapalemur and Prolemur) first appeared in the mid- to late-1980s following the rediscovery of the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus). However, the name became more generally used a year or two later following the discovery of the golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus) in 1987. For a few years, both names or combinations of both were widely used, but \\"bamboo lemur\\" became the preferred name in 1994 with the publication of the first edition of Lemurs of Madagascar. The term \\"gentle lemur\\" has seen little use in both popular and academic literature since the early 2000s.  Description  Lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus) The bamboo lemurs are characterized by a grey-brown fur, which varies by species. Their muzzles are short and their ears are round and hairy. Lengths vary from 26 to 46 cm (10.2 to 18.1 inches), with tails just as long or longer, and they weigh up to 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds.) Bamboo lemurs prefer damp forests where bamboo grows. Although they can be active any time of the day, they are often active just after dawn. Though primarily arboreal, they sometimes come down to the ground. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur or bandro (Hapalemur alaotrensis), which lives in the reed beds of Lac Alaotra, spends much of its time in water and can swim well, unlike other lemur species, which only venture to water to drink. The lesser gentle lemurs live together in groups of three to five animals, which probably represent families composed of a male, one or two females, and their offspring. They communicate with a variety of sounds. They are called bamboo lemurs because they almost exclusively eat bamboo. How bamboo lemurs can detoxify the high amounts of cyanide (from bamboo shoots) in their diets is unknown. Gestation lasts 135 to 150 days and ends between September and January, when the female bears one to two young. These are weaned after about four months (if the food supply is ample) and are fully mature at two years of age. Their life expectancy is up to 12 years.  Classification  As of 2010, the classification of bamboo lemurs lists five species and three subspecies. * Genus Hapalemur ** Eastern lesser bamboo lemur, H griseus *** Eastern lesser bamboo lemur, H. g. griseus *** Gilbert's bamboo lemur, H. g. gilberti *** Ranomafana bamboo lemur, H. g. ranomafanensis ** Southern lesser bamboo lemur, H. meridionalis ** Western lesser bamboo lemur, H. occidentalis ** Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur, H. alaotrensis ** Golden bamboo lemur, H. aureus References External links * Primate Info Net Hapalemur Factsheets * Conservation of the Alaotra Gentle Lemur - by Madagascar Wildlife Conservation ","title":"Bamboo lemur"},{"id":"1259244","text":"David Richard Gress (born 29 January 1953) is a Danish historian, known for his 1998 survey From Plato to Nato on Western identity and grand narratives. Life He was born in Copenhagen, the son of R. W. B. Lewis, an American literary historian, and the Danish writer, playwright and essayist Elsa Gress. The two were not married, which is why Gress uses his mother's maiden name. She subsequently married the American painter Charles Clifford Wright.Theartpages.Com He attended Sor√∏ Akademis Skole. He was later educated in Classics at Cambridge University, England, and Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, where he received his Ph.D. in medieval history in 1981. From 1982-92 he was a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, publishing articles and books on international strategy, the West German peace movement, U.S. foreign policy, Nordic politics, and a history of West Germany. From 1993-95 he was visiting fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and lecturer in international history there. From 1996-99 he was a fellow at the Danish Institute of International Affairs and from 1999-2001 assistant professor of Classics at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. In 2001-03 he was professor of the history of civilizations at Boston University and has since 2003 been based in Denmark, where he continues to publish articles and books in political philosophy, the origins of Western prosperity, contemporary history and political culture. He is a well-known face in the public debate of Denmark. He has been a fellow of the Danish Institute of International Affairs and director of the Center for Studies on America and the West at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Philadelphia. he has been a columnist in the Danish daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten. David Gress is also a frequently used media commentator, and a senior fellow of the Danish think tank CEPOS. Work In his first book, 'Demokrati eller?' Gress provided a justification of liberal democracy. It included a defense of ecological production, something that Gress has since disavowed. His doctoral dissertation was a critical edition of a 13th-century papal biography. 'Peace and Survival' was a philosophical and political history and critique of the pacifist mentality, with particular reference to the West German peace movement, which in his view was surrendering to Soviet power. Apart from various shorter works on Nordic politics and U.S. foreign policy, his next major work followed on from 'Peace and Survival' to provide a political, social, and economic history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The first edition appeared in the fall of 1989, a French edition in 1992 and a second in English in 1993; these included a survey of the unification of Germany and a look back at the history of East Germany. From Plato to Nato was, amongst other things, an intervention in the campus culture wars, explaining that the narrative model of 'The West', in the general style of Will Durant, had become threadbare. His proposed replacement marked him as, in general terms, a Burkean conservative. He argued that 'The West' was in operative terms much more of a complex compound of elements he identified as 'Old West', of Roman and Germanic provenance, with modern Adam Smith economics, than a pure play on the Enlightenment philosophy. The book's development is complex and somewhat muddied by the wish also to be inclusive of other conservative views. Norman Davies, a Polish history specialist critical of incoherent definitions of Europe viewed from the Atlantic end, has lent some support to the outline thesis. Gress has further identified the campus debates as a target, with an attack on Martin Bernal and other interventions in U.S. and British journals of opinion. From 2003 to 2012 he published mostly in Danish, including two books and numerous articles, reviews, and comments in Danish daily newspapers, chiefly Jyllands-Posten, but from 2009 also Politiken. One, more polemical, focus has been criticism of the Nordic welfare state and environmental policy, another has been periodic surveys of international publications and research on U.S. politics and society, history, and religion. He has been one of the most outspoken Danish critics of the theory of anthropogenic global warming, and has accordingly received heavy criticism by Danish scientists.

History Pediment of the Paris Law Faculty When the University of Paris (nicknamed the Sorbonne), which had been founded in the middle of the 12th century and officially ceased to exist on 31 December 1970, following the student protests of 1968, the Faculty of Law and Economics of Paris professors had to choose the future of the faculty. Most of the law professors (88 out of 108) wished only to restructure it into a new university. In pursuit of this, they founded with professors of economics the \\"University of law, economics and social sciences of Paris\\" or \\"Paris II\\" and kept in it the research centers and teaching programs of the Paris Law faculty.Conac, pp. 177-178. Hence, it is generally considered as its direct inheritor.Direct √âtudiant, Universit√© Panth√©on-Assas. The official name of the university was changed to \\"Panth√©on-Assas (Paris II)\\" in 1990. The name Panth√©on-Assas is a reference to the main addresses of the pre-1968 faculty of law of Paris, which are now part of the university; namely, the buildings on Place du Panth√©on and Rue d'Assas.Conac, p. 191. The university is also referred to as \\"Assas\\" or \\"Paris II\\", \\"Sorbonne-Assas\\" and \\"Sorbonne Law School\\".

He became active in the Fluxus movement in the 1960s and moved to the United States in 1972.Yasunao Tone Bio at Lovely Music http://www.lovely.com/bios/tone.html He organized and participated in many noise music performance groups such as Group Ongaku, Hi-Red Center and Team Random (the first computer art group organized in Japan). Overview Yasunao Tone is known mostly for his musical work, much of which relies on unconventional techniques. Tone began manipulating compact disks to achieve uniquely mangled sounds in the early 1980s. For his 1997 album, Solo for Wounded CD, he damaged audio CDs and used the information that a CD player was able to extract from those discs to create new pieces. Tone's CD-player-based works employ a process of \\"de-controlling\\" the device's playback so that it randomly selects fragments from a set of sound materials. Tone has stated that the error-correction functionality of modern CD players has made it hard to continue to use this technique and, for this reason, he continues to use older equipment. For his collaboration with Florian Hecker, Palimpsest, he converted Japanese Man'y≈çsh≈´ poems to sound.Cisneros, R. Jim√©nez. (2009) BLACKOUT.

The phel√≥nion (Greek: (plural, , phail√≥nia; Latin paenula) is a liturgical vestment worn by a priest of the Eastern Christian tradition. It is worn over the priest's other vestments and is equivalent to the chasuble of Western Christianity.  Origin  Like the chasuble, the phelonion was originally a sort of poncho, a round vestment with a hole in the middle for the head, which fell to the feet on all sides. In its present form (dating from about the fifteenth century) the front is largely cut away (from about the waist down) to facilitate the movements of the priest's hands. In Russia the longer front remained common until quite recent times. The use of the phelonion is not limited to the Divine Liturgy but is specified for any major liturgical function. It is also called phenolion (; plural phenolia ) in some books.  Styles  There are two main styles of phelonion. Byzantine- or Greek-style phelonia are tailored to fit over the shoulders, while Russian- style phelonia (–§–µ–ª–æ–Ω—å, felon) have a high, stiffened collar that covers the back of the head. There is also a shortened phelonion (–§–µ–ª–æ–Ω—á–∏–∫, felonchik) that is worn by a reader at his tonsuring. This small phelonion is still worn by altar servers in Old Believers churches. The Greek-style phelonion is, generally speaking, worn by those with a historical and geographical closer tie with the Patriarch of Constantinople, which would include most Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, Greece, the Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria, as well as Greek-Catholics and Orthodox in western Ukraine. Russian- style phelonion seen from the back and front (Father Sergi Standhart of the Russian Orthodox Church in Amsterdam). The Russian-style phelonion is used by the Russian Orthodox, Ukrainian Autocephalous, Ukrainian Orthodox (Moscow Patriarchate), Polish Orthodox churches, as well as the Orthodox Church in America. There is also a version used by some Ukrainian and Bulgarian Orthodox which is half-way between the Russian and Greek styles. Fresco of St. Gregory the Great wearing the type of phelonion worn by bishops called the polystavrion, as well as a white omophor. (14th century, Mistras). A bishop who wishes to serve a Divine Liturgy as a priest (i.e., without the special rites and prayers of the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy) will sometimes vest in a phelonion instead of his sakkos, but with the omophorion around his neck. This is also done in the Liturgy of St. James. Originally, before the introduction of the sakkos, bishops wore a phelonion identical to that worn by priests, except that it was made of cloth that was either woven or embroidered with a pattern of multiple crosses, called a polystavrion (\\"many crosses\\"). In Oriental Orthodoxy, the phelonion is often only clasped at the neck, and is thus more open than the Byzantine-style, resembling a Western cope. Its various names are phanolion (Coptic), paynƒÅ (Assyrian), phayno (Syriac Orthodox), ≈°urdzar (Armenian) and kƒÅppƒÅ (Ethiopian). These are worn by bishops as well as priests (the sakkos is not worn by priests).

In most situations, the salute is made with the right hand, palm face out, the thumb holding down the little finger, and with the fingertips on the brow of the head. There are some variations of the salute between national Scouting organizations and also within some programme sections. A \\"half-salute\\", known as the Scout Sign, is also used in certain situations. The hand is still held palm facing out, and the thumb holding the little finger, but the hand is held at the shoulder instead. Other organizations with historical ties to Scouting such as Scouts Royale Brotherhood and Alpha Phi Omega use it as well.  Meaning of the three fingers  Scouts using the three-finger salute as the Scout Sign. A Christmas cookie as three-finger salute. In his book, Scouting for Boys, Robert Baden- Powell chose the three-finger salute for Scouts to represent the three aspects of the Scout Promise: # Honor God and Country # Help Others # Obey the Scout Law = Cub Scouts' two-finger salute = Cub Scout sections can use a two- finger salute, depending on the national Scouting organization they belong to. This is done to represent the two rules of the original Cub Scout / Wolf Cub law. The salute is performed with the right hand. In The Wolf Cub's Handbook, Baden-Powell wrote: \\"Why two fingers? Well, you know what a Wolf's head looks like with two ears cocked up. It is used as the badge of the Wolf Cub. Your two fingers in the salute are the two ears of the Wolf.\\"The Wolf Cub's Handbook (p. 15)  Salute or sign?  Originally, Baden-Powell intended for Scouts to salute each other in greeting when they first saw each other for the first time using the \\"secret sign\\", or half-salute. This was regardless of whether the Scouts knew each other or not. Officers, such as Patrol Leaders, Scoutmasters, or members of the armed forces, were to be saluted with a full- salute.Prahran Chronicle (Vic. : 1914‚Äì1918) Saturday 17 July 1915, p. 5[http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/por/general_rules.htm P.O.R. iX. General Rules, Rule 352 Full-salutes were also required at the hoisting of the Union Flag, the playing of the national anthem, or at funerals.  Canada  In Scouts Canada the Salute is rendered vertically, palm out similar to British Army/Commonwealth salutes, except if the member is a Sea Scout where it is palm in/angled down. (Traditionally, to hide your 'dirty hands' from the ship's captain.) Beaver Scouts in Canada use a variant of the two-fingered sign with the fingers bent forwards forming \\"teeth\\". When they move up to Cub Scouts part of the ceremony sometimes includes a Scouter straightening the fingers to change from the Beaver to Cub sign.  Switzerland and Belgium  The half-salute is used by Swiss Scouts when shaking (left) hands with other Scouts or leaders on greeting or parting. Additional meaning of the thumb holding down the little finger as explained in Switzerland: the big and strong protects the weak and little.  United Kingdom  The Scout Association uses the three-fingered salute for all sections, including Cub Scouts. The two- fingered Cub salute was abandoned by the Scout Association following a recommendation by the Advance Party Report in 1966, that \\"there should be only one salute for the whole Movement\\".The Advance Party Report '66 (Recommendation 10, p. 14) The Scout Sign is used while making or reaffirming the Beaver Scout, Cub Scout or Scout Promise and at no other time.The Scout Association ‚Äì Policy, Organisation and Rules ‚Äì January 2011: Rules 12.5 and 12.6 The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association uses both the three and two fingered salutes.

The Timberwolf (cub) section uses the two-finger (spread) salute, and the two finger scout salute as defined in the 1938 PO&R;, while the Pathfinder (scout) and Rovers use the traditional three-finger sign and salute. = Boy Scouts of America = Cub Scouts use the two finger Scout sign and salute‚Äîthe sign is presented with the fingers apart to represent the ears of Akela the wolf. Scouts BSA, Venturers and Sea Scouts use the three finger sign and salute. The Scout Sign is performed with the upper arm parallel to the ground and the forearm vertical, forming a right angle at the elbow. The Scout Sign is used when reciting any of the ideals of the BSA such as the Scout Oath and Scout Law. It is also used to gain the attention of the group. The salute is rendered in the American style with the palm in and is only used to salute the flag of the United States. Early BSA protocol required Scouts to salute each other, but this was discontinued in 1972. = Girl Scouts of the USA = As a member of WAGGGS, the Girl Scouts of the USA use the three-fingered sign at shoulder height. The three fingers represent the person's own spiritual beliefs, other people and the Girl Scout Law. This differs from the 1913 version where the first finger represented God and Country.  Worldwide  All World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts members share the three fingered sign, with the palm facing out held at shoulder height, elbow by the side and the thumb holding the little finger. This is used in numerous situations of respect including when making or reciting the Promise, receiving awards, honouring a flag, honouring the dead and meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.

An HMD has many uses including gaming, aviation, engineering, and medicine . Virtual reality headsets are HMDs combined with IMUs. There is also an optical head-mounted display (OHMD), which is a wearable display that can reflect projected images and allows a user to see through it.  Overview  LED illuminators and cameras to measure eye movementsalt= A typical HMD has one or two small displays, with lenses and semi-transparent mirrors embedded in eyeglasses (also termed data glasses), a visor, or a helmet. The display units are miniaturized and may include cathode ray tubes (CRT), liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), liquid crystal on silicon (LCos), or organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). Some vendors employ multiple micro-displays to increase total resolution and field of view. HMDs differ in whether they can display only computer-generated imagery (CGI), or only live imagery from the physical world, or combination. Most HMDs can display only a computer-generated image, sometimes referred to as virtual image. Some HMDs can allow a CGI to be superimposed on real-world view. This is sometimes referred to as augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). Combining real-world view with CGI can be done by projecting the CGI through a partially reflective mirror and viewing the real world directly. This method is often called optical see-through. Combining real-world view with CGI can also be done electronically by accepting video from a camera and mixing it electronically with CGI.  Optical HMD  An optical head-mounted display uses an optical mixer which is made of partly silvered mirrors. It can reflect artificial images, and let real images cross the lens, and let a user look through it. Various methods have existed for see-through HMD's, most of which can be summarized into two main families based on curved mirrors or waveguides. Curved mirrors have been used by Laster Technologies, and by Vuzix in their Star 1200 product. Various waveguide methods have existed for years. These include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, and reflective optics.  Applications  Major HMD applications include military, government (fire, police, etc.), and civilian-commercial (medicine, video gaming, sports, etc.). = Aviation and tactical, ground = U.S. Air Force flight equipment technician testing a Scorpion helmet mounted integrated targeting systemalt= In 1962, Hughes Aircraft Company revealed the Electrocular, a compact CRT(7\\" long), head- mounted monocular display that reflected a TV signal in to transparent eyepiece.Dr. James Miller, Fullerton, CA, research psychologist for the Ground Systems Group at Hughes, \\"I've Got a Secret\\", April 9, 1962 on CBS Ruggedized HMDs are increasingly being integrated into the cockpits of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft. These are usually fully integrated with the pilot's flying helmet and may include protective visors, night vision devices, and displays of other symbology. Military, police, and firefighters use HMDs to display tactical information such as maps or thermal imaging data while viewing a real scene. Recent applications have included the use of HMD for paratroopers. In 2005, the Liteye HMD was introduced for ground combat troops as a rugged, waterproof lightweight display that clips into a standard U.S. PVS-14 military helmet mount. The self-contained color monocular organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display replaces the NVG tube and connects to a mobile computing device. The LE has see-through ability and can be used as a standard HMD or for augmented reality applications. The design is optimized to provide high definition data under all lighting conditions, in covered or see- through modes of operation. The LE has a low power consumption, operating on four AA batteries for 35 hours or receiving power via standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) continues to fund research in augmented reality HMDs as part of the Persistent Close Air Support (PCAS) Program. Vuzix is currently working on a system for PCAS that will use holographic waveguides to produce see-through augmented reality glasses that are only a few millimeters thick. = Engineering = Engineers and scientists use HMDs to provide stereoscopic views of computer-aided design (CAD) schematics. Virtual reality, when applied to engineering and design, is a key factor in integration of the human in the design. By enabling engineers to interact with their designs in full life-size scale, products can be validated for issues that may not have been visible until physical prototyping. The use of HMDs for VR is seen as supplemental to the conventional use of CAVE for VR simulation. HMDs are predominantly used for single-person interaction with the design, while CAVEs allow for more collaborative virtual reality sessions. Head Mounted Display systems are also used in the maintenance of complex systems, as they can give a technician a simulated x-ray vision by combining computer graphics such as system diagrams and imagery with the technician's natural vision (augmented or modified reality). = Medicine and research = There are also applications in surgery, wherein a combination of radiographic data (X-ray computed tomography (CAT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging) is combined with the surgeon's natural view of the operation, and anesthesia, where the patient vital signs are within the anesthesiologist's field of view at all times. Research universities often use HMDs to conduct studies related to vision, balance, cognition and neuroscience. As of 2010, the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied. In visual tracking tests, a HMD unit with eye tracking ability shows an object moving in a regular pattern. People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory. = Gaming and video = Low-cost HMD devices are available for use with 3D games and entertainment applications. One of the first commercially available HMDs was the Forte VFX1 which was announced at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 1994. The VFX-1 had stereoscopic displays, 3-axis head-tracking, and stereo headphones. Another pioneer in this field was Sony, which released the Glasstron in 1997. It had as an optional accessory a positional sensor which permitted the user to view the surroundings, with the perspective moving as the head moved, providing a deep sense of immersion. One novel application of this technology was in the game MechWarrior 2, which permitted users of the Sony Glasstron or Virtual I/O's iGlasses to adopt a new visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft's own cockpit. Many brands of video glasses can be connected to modern video and DSLR cameras, making them applicable as a new age monitor. As a result of the glasses ability to block out ambient light, filmmakers and photographers are able to see clearer presentations of their live images. The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display created by Palmer Luckey that the company Oculus VR developed for virtual reality simulations and video games. The HTC Vive is a virtual reality head-mounted display. The headset is produced by a collaboration between Valve and HTC, with its defining feature being precision room-scale tracking, and high-precision motion controllers. The PlayStation VR is the a virtual reality headset for gaming consoles, dedicated for the PlayStation 4. Windows Mixed Reality is a platform developed by Microsoft which includes a wide range of headsets produced by HP, Samsung, and others and is capable of playing most HTC Vive games. It uses only inside-out tracking for its controllers. = Virtual cinema = Some head-mounted displays are designed to present traditional video and film content in a virtual cinema. These devices typically feature relatively narrow fields of view of 50-60¬∞ and so are less immersive than virtual-reality headsets but they offer correspondingly higher resolution in terms of pixels per degree. Products released by 2018 featuring 1920√ó1080 resolution per eye included the Goovis G2 and Royole Moon. = Sports = A HMD system has been developed for Formula One drivers by Kopin Corp. and the BMW Group. The HMD displays critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focusing on the track as pit crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through two- way radio. Recon Instruments released on two head-mounted displays for ski goggles, MOD and MOD Live, the latter based on an Android operating system. = Training and simulation = A key application for HMDs is training and simulation, allowing to virtually place a trainee in a situation that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in real-life. Training with HMDs covers a wide range of applications from driving, welding and spray painting, flight and vehicle simulators, dismounted soldier training, medical procedure training, and more. However, a number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of certain types of head-mounted displays, and these issues must be resolved before optimal training and simulation is feasible.Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.  Performance parameters  * Ability to show stereoscopic imagery. A binocular HMD has the potential to display a different image to each eye. This can be used to show stereoscopic images. It should be borne in mind that so-called 'Optical Infinity' is generally taken by flight surgeons and display experts as about 9 meters. This is the distance at which, given the average human eye rangefinder \\"baseline\\" (distance between the eyes or Interpupillary distance (IPD)) of between 2.5 and 3 inches (6 and 8 cm), the angle of an object at that distance becomes essentially the same from each eye. At smaller ranges the perspective from each eye is significantly different and the expense of generating two different visual channels through the computer- generated imagery (CGI) system becomes worthwhile. * Interpupillary distance (IPD). This is the distance between the two eyes, measured at the pupils, and is important in designing head-mounted displays. * Field of view (FOV) ‚Äì Humans have an FOV of around 180¬∞, but most HMDs offer far less than this. Typically, a greater field of view results in a greater sense of immersion and better situational awareness. Most people do not have a good feel for what a particular quoted FOV would look like (e.g., 25¬∞) so often manufacturers will quote an apparent screen size. Most people sit about 60 cm away from their monitors and have quite a good feel about screen sizes at that distance. To convert the manufacturer's apparent screen size to a desktop monitor position, divide the screen size by the distance in feet, then multiply by 2. Consumer- level HMDs typically offer a FOV of about 110¬∞. * Resolution ‚Äì HMDs usually mention either the total number of pixels or the number of pixels per degree. Listing the total number of pixels (e.g., 1600√ó1200 pixels per eye) is borrowed from how the specifications of computer monitors are presented. However, the pixel density, usually specified in pixels per degree or in arcminutes per pixel, is also used to determine visual acuity. 60 pixels/¬∞ (1 arcmin/pixel) is usually referred to as eye limiting resolution, above which increased resolution is not noticed by people with normal vision. HMDs typically offer 10 to 20 pixels/¬∞, though advances in micro-displays help increase this number. * Binocular overlap ‚Äì measures the area that is common to both eyes. Binocular overlap is the basis for the sense of depth and stereo, allowing humans to sense which objects are near and which objects are far. Humans have a binocular overlap of about 100¬∞ (50¬∞ to the left of the nose and 50¬∞ to the right). The larger the binocular overlap offered by an HMD, the greater the sense of stereo. Overlap is sometimes specified in degrees (e.g., 74¬∞) or as a percentage indicating how much of the visual field of each eye is common to the other eye. * Distant focus (collimation). Optical methods may be used to present the images at a distant focus, which seems to improve the realism of images that in the real world would be at a distance. * On-board processing and operating system. Some HMD vendors offer on-board operating systems such as Android, allowing applications to run locally on the HMD, and eliminating the need to be tethered to an external device to generate video. These are sometimes referred to as smart goggles. To make the HMD construction lighter producers may move the processing system to connected smart necklace form-factor that would also offer the additional benefit of larger battery pack. Such solution would allow to design lite HMD with sufficient energy supply for dual video inputs or higher frequency time-based multiplexing (see below).  Support of 3D video formats  Frame sequential multiplexing Side-by-side and top-bottom multiplexing Depth perception inside an HMD requires different images for the left and right eyes. There are multiple ways to provide these separate images: * Use dual video inputs, thereby providing a completely separate video signal to each eye * Time-based multiplexing. Methods such as frame sequential combine two separate video signals into one signal by alternating the left and right images in successive frames. * Side by side or top-bottom multiplexing. This method allocated half of the image to the left eye and the other half of the image to the right eye. The advantage of dual video inputs is that it provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye. The disadvantage of dual video inputs is that it requires separate video outputs and cables from the device generating the content. Time-based multiplexing preserves the full resolution per each image, but reduces the frame rate by half. For example, if the signal is presented at 60 Hz, each eye is receiving just 30 Hz updates. This may become an issue with accurately presenting fast-moving images. Side- by-side and top-bottom multiplexing provide full-rate updates to each eye, but reduce the resolution presented to each eye. Many 3D broadcasts, such as ESPN, chose to provide side-by-side 3D which saves the need to allocate extra transmission bandwidth and is more suitable to fast-paced sports action relative to time-based multiplexing methods. Not all HMDs provide depth perception. Some lower-end modules are essentially bi-ocular devices where both eyes are presented with the same image. 3D video players sometimes allow maximum compatibility with HMDs by providing the user with a choice of the 3D format to be used.  Peripherals  * The most rudimentary HMDs simply project an image or symbology on a wearer's visor or reticle. The image is not bound to the real world, i.e., the image does not change based on the wearer's head position. * More sophisticated HMDs incorporate a positioning system that tracks the wearer's head position and angle, so that the picture or symbol displayed is congruent with the outside world using see-through imagery. * Head tracking ‚Äì Binding the imagery. Head-mounted displays may also be used with tracking sensors that detect changes of angle and orientation. When such data is available in the system computer, it can be used to generate the appropriate computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the angle-of-look at the particular time. This allows the user to look around a virtual reality environment simply by moving the head without the need for a separate controller to change the angle of the imagery. In radio-based systems (compared to wires), the wearer may move about within the tracking limits of the system. * Eye tracking ‚Äì Eye trackers measure the point of gaze, allowing a computer to sense where the user is looking. This information is useful in a variety of contexts such as user interface navigation: By sensing the user's gaze, a computer can change the information displayed on a screen, bring added details to attention, etc. * Hand tracking ‚Äì tracking hand movement from the perspective of the HMD allows natural interaction with content and a convenient game-play mechanism  See also  *Computer-mediated reality * Eyetap * Head-up display (HUD) *Lumus-optical *Positioning technologies * Screenless video * Stereoscopy * Virtual retinal display * List of optical head-mounted display manufacturers  References   Bibliography  * Head Mounted Displays: Designing for the user; Melzer and Moffitt; McGraw Hill, 1997. * O.

Onegin is Martha Fiennes' directorial debut and stars her brother Ralph Fiennes in the role of Yevgeny (Eugene) Onegin, Liv Tyler as Tatiana, Irene Worth as Princess Alina and Toby Stephens as Lensky. Two other Fiennes siblings were involved in the project: Magnus Fiennes wrote the music and Sophie Fiennes appeared in a minor role. Plot In early 19th century Russia, a bored St. Petersburg socialite named Onegin inherits his uncle's estate in the country. There, he meets a neighbouring landowner and aspiring poet, Lensky, and a widowed mother and her two daughters. The poet is engaged to the elder daughter Olga. Her sister, Tatiana, writes Onegin a passionate love letter but is cruelly spurned by him apparently due to her lack of social experience. His flirtatious attentions towards Lensky's fianc√©e lead to a duel. The duel is arranged to take place in a secluded place by a local lake, and unknown to the participants, Tatiana secretly witnesses the duel from a safe distance. She sees the outcome of Lensky taking the first shot and missing his opponent, followed by Onegin taking careful aim and disposing of Lensky with a shot to his opponent's head killing him instantly. Onegin soon after departs from his country estate. On his return, six years later, to St Petersburg, he encounters Tatiana, the woman whom he spurned, who is now a woman of refinement and married to a prince. Onegin begs her forgiveness for his past behaviour and becomes solicitous of her favors. After explaining to him that too much time has now passed, she refuses him and he is in turn now spurned by her. Production The film compresses the events of the novel somewhat; for example, the Naming Day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatyana. As a result, Onegin's reasons for dancing with Olga and insulting Lensky are left somewhat confusing. Much like the 1988 film version, Onegin gives the impression that, during the duel sequence, Onegin shoots to kill. Cast *Ralph Fiennes as Yevgeny Onegin *Liv Tyler as Tatyana Larina *Toby Stephens as Vladimir Lensky *Lena Headey as Olga Larina *Martin Donovan as Prince Nikitin *Alun Armstrong as Zaretsky *Harriet Walter as Madame Larina *Irene Worth as Princess Alina *Jason Watkins as Guillot *Simon McBurney as Triquet *Gwenllian Davies as Anisia *Margery Withers as Nanya *Geoff McGivern as Andrey Petrovitch Reception Onegin received mixed reviews, with praise for its production values and performances, but criticism was leveled at the pacing and writing. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times said, 'There is a cool, mannered elegance to the picture that I like, but it's dead at its center. There is no feeling that real feelings are at risk here.'. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, \\"An earnest but worthwhile attempt to render the Russian writer's tragic and romantic verse novel of 1833 for the screen... we are estranged from the distinctively comic savour of the original. But there still remains much that is worthwhile in this high-minded adaptation.\\" On the more positive side though, Derek Elley of Variety said ' ‚ÄúOnegin‚Äù may not appeal to more cynical viewers unprepared to take the emotional leap of faith the movie demands.' It currently holds a 'rotten' 48% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. =Awards= Martha Fiennes received the Best Director Award at the Tokyo Film Festival and the London Film Critics Circle's award for Best Newcomer. Onegin was also nominated for Best British Film at the British Academy Film Awards and Liv Tyler received the Golden Aries prize for Best Foreign Actress from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.

It is named after a freshwater lake and wildlife refuge. Canada Water tube, Overground and bus station is immediately north of the lake, along with Canada Water Library which overhangs the lake and Deal Porter Square. Surrey Quays Shopping Centre is also adjacent, sitting immediately to the south. The surrounding area, which forms the town centre of Rotherhithe, is now increasingly known as Canada Water, after the transport interchange as much as the lake itself. History and development The Albion Channel linking Canada Water with Surrey Water The lake is named after the former Canada Dock, of which Canada Water is the surviving northern third, and which was mainly used by ships from Canada. As with much of the Docklands, the Surrey Commercial Docks closed in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation took over, and invested heavily in the redevelopment of the area. About half of Canada Dock was infilled and the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre built on top of it; the remainder was converted into the present lake and wildlife refuge. An ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created (through the site of the now filled-in Albion Dock) linking Canada Water to Surrey Water, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill in nearby Russia Dock Woodland. Following the earlier gentrification of the parts of Rotherhithe along the river, the extensionLine facts  Transport for London of the Jubilee line in 1999 moved the focus to the area immediately around Canada Water. The opening of the new Canada Water Underground station gave the area rapid connections to the rest of London, with Canary Wharf one stop, Westminster less than 10 minutes, and Bond Street around 15 minutes away by underground train. The station's connection to the London Overground network in 2010 has added a quick connection to the City of London, with a journey of around 10 minutes to Shoreditch High Street station, near Liverpool Street Station. Much of the area is now going through a phase of rapid development, with new residential developments, a new library which opened in November 2011, caf√©s and restaurants planned around the lake, and plans to redevelop the shopping mall in a first step towards creating a more traditional town centre. Freshwater lake Canada Water is the only body of fresh water in London Docklands. The lake is now kept topped up with fresh water using a windpump. This arrangement was put in place following research by the Landscape Architect Fraser Borwick, which revealed that ground water had historically been extracted to supply various industrial processes using wind power. After checking the borehole results of the Jubilee line construction team, it was established that large amounts of potable water were available, and a borehole 80 metres long was sunk into the ground. The borehole is lined for 60 metres, and the bottom 20 metres is into chalk. The investigation of how best to keep the lake topped up with fresh water was the result of some damage to the lining of the old dock during construction works in the 1980s. Another solution considered involved securing a water supply from the flooded tunnels of London Underground, but this was considered too risky. cmglee_London_Canada_Water_lake.jpgThe lake with Surrey Quays Shopping Centre in the distance cmglee_London_Canada_Water_station.jpgCanada Water Underground, Overground and bus station cmglee_London_Canada_Water_flats.jpgColumbia Point (left) and Regina House (right) flats cmglee_London_Canada_Water_library.jpgThe main floor of Canada Water Library  Places nearby  Former Surrey Dock Offices, close by Canada Water *Surrey Quays Shopping Centre *Greenland Dock *Rotherhithe *Russia Dock Woodland *St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe *Stave Hill (including Ecological Park) *Swedish Seamen's Church *Southwark Park *Bacon's College *Brunel Museum References External links *Canada Water Redevelopment promotional website *Canada Water Consultative Forum & Canada Water Campaign Category:London docks Category:Geography of the London Borough of Southwark Category:Redevelopment projects in London Category:Rotherhithe ","title":"Canada Water"},{"id":"1259310","text":"Stein Dorenfeldt T√∏nnesson (born 2 December 1953) is a Norwegian historian.

It consists of two electromagnets on the same axis. Besides creating magnetic fields, Helmholtz coils are also used in scientific apparatus to cancel external magnetic fields, such as the Earth's magnetic field. A beam of cathode rays in a vacuum tube bent into a circle by a Helmholtz coil  Description  A Helmholtz pair consists of two identical circular magnetic coils that are placed symmetrically along a common axis, one on each side of the experimental area, and separated by a distance h equal to the radius R of the coil. Each coil carries an equal electric current in the same direction. Setting h=R, which is what defines a Helmholtz pair, minimizes the nonuniformity of the field at the center of the coils, in the sense of setting \\\\partial^{2}B/\\\\partial x^{2} = 0Helmholtz Coil in CGS units (meaning that the first nonzero derivative is \\\\partial^{4}B/\\\\partial x^{4} as explained below), but leaves about 7% variation in field strength between the center and the planes of the coils. A slightly larger value of h reduces the difference in field between the center and the planes of the coils, at the expense of worsening the field's uniformity in the region near the center, as measured by \\\\partial^{2}B/\\\\partial x^{2}.Electromagnetism In some applications, a Helmholtz coil is used to cancel out the Earth's magnetic field, producing a region with a magnetic field intensity much closer to zero.\\"Earth Field Magnetometer: Helmholtz coil\\" by Richard Wotiz 2004  Mathematics  thumb255pxMagnetic field lines in a plane bisecting the current loops. Note the field is approximately uniform in between the coil pair. (In this picture the coils are placed one beside the other: the axis is horizontal.) Magnetic field induction along the axis crossing the center of coils; z = 0 is the point in the middle of the distance between coils Contours showing the magnitude of the magnetic field near a coil pair, with one coil at top and the other at bottom. Inside the central \\"octopus\\", the field is within 1% of its central value B0. The eight contours are for field magnitudes of 0.5 B0, 0.8 B0, 0.9 B0, 0.95 B0, 0.99 B0, 1.01 B0, 1.05 B0, and 1.1 B0. The calculation of the exact magnetic field at any point in space is mathematically complex and involves the study of Bessel functions. Things are simpler along the axis of the coil-pair, and it is convenient to think about the Taylor series expansion of the field strength as a function of x, the distance from the central point of the coil-pair along the axis. By symmetry, the odd-order terms in the expansion are zero. By arranging the coils so that the origin x=0 is an inflection point for the field strength due to each coil separately, one can guarantee that the order x^2 term is also zero, and hence the leading non-constant term is of order x^4. The inflection point for a simple coil is located along the coil axis at a distance R/2 from its centre. Thus the locations for the two coils are x=\\\\pm R/2. The calculation detailed below gives the exact value of the magnetic field at the center point. If the radius is R, the number of turns in each coil is n and the current through the coils is I, then the magnetic field B at the midpoint between the coils will be given by : B = {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{4}{5} \\\\right )}^{3/2} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I}{R}, where \\\\mu_0 is the permeability of free space . = Derivation = Start with the formula for the on-axis field due to a single wire loop which is itself derived from the Biot‚ÄìSavart law:http://hyperphysics.phy- astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/magnetic/curloo.html#c3 : B_1(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2+x^2)^{3/2}}.

The Helmholtz coils consists of n turns of wire, so the equivalent current in a one-turn coil is n times the current I in the n-turn coil. Substituting nI for I in the above formula gives the field for an n-turn coil: : B_1(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2(R^2 + x^2)^{3/2}}. In a Helmholtz coil, a point halfway between the two loops has an x value equal to R/2, so calculate the field strength at that point: : B_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2\\\\left(R^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{3/2}}. There are also two coils instead of one (the coil above is at x=0; there is a second coil at x=R). From symmetry, the field strength at the midpoint will be twice the single coil value: : \\\\begin{align} B\\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right) &= 2 B_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{2\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{2\\\\left(R^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{3/2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{\\\\left(R^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{3/2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{\\\\left(R^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4}R^2\\\\right)^{3/2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I R^2}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{4}R^2\\\\right)^{3/2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {\\\\left(\\\\frac{4}{5}\\\\right)}^{3/2} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I}{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {\\\\left(\\\\frac{8}{5\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\right)} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 n I}{R}. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align}  Time-varying magnetic field  Most Helmholtz coils use DC (direct) current to produce a static magnetic field. Many applications and experiments require a time-varying magnetic field. These applications include magnetic field susceptibility tests, scientific experiments, and biomedical studies (the interaction between magnetic field and living tissue). The required magnetic fields are usually either pulse or continuous sinewave. The magnetic field frequency range can be anywhere from near DC (0 Hz) to many kilohertz or even megahertz (MHz). An AC Helmholtz coil driver is needed to generate the required time-varying magnetic field. The waveform amplifier driver must be able to output high AC current to produce the magnetic field. = Driver voltage and current = Use the above equation in the mathematics section to calculate the coil current for a desired magnetic field, .

Generating a high-frequency magnetic field is more challenging. The coils are inductors, and their impedance increases proportionally with frequency. To provide the same field intensity at twice the frequency requires twice the voltage across the coil. Instead of directly driving the coil with a high voltage, a series resonant circuit may be used to provide the high voltage. A series capacitor is added in series with the coils. The capacitance is chosen to resonate the coil at the desired frequency. Only the coils parasitic resistance remains. This method only works at frequencies close to the resonant frequency; to generate the field at other frequencies requires different capacitors. The Helmholtz coil resonant frequency, f_0, and capacitor value, C, are given below. :f_0=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{\\\\left (L_1+L_2\\\\right )C}} :C=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left ( 2\\\\pi f\\\\right )^2\\\\left ( L_1 +L_2\\\\right )} Maxwell coils Helmholtz coils (hoops) on three perpendicular axes used to cancel the Earth's magnetic field inside the vacuum tank in a 1957 electron beam experiment To improve the uniformity of the field in the space inside the coils, additional coils can be added around the outside. James Clerk Maxwell showed in 1873 that a third larger-diameter coil located midway between the two Helmholtz coils with the coil distance increased from coil radius R to \\\\sqrt{3}R can reduce the variance of the field on the axis to zero up to the sixth derivative of position. This is sometimes called a Maxwell coil.

If one coil is reversed, it produces a cusp trap, which also traps charged particles.http://radphys4.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/asacusa/wiki/index.php?Cusp%20trap *Helmholtz coils were designed and built for the Army Research Laboratory's electromagnetic composite testing laboratory in 1993, for testing of composite materials to low-frequency magnetic fields.
