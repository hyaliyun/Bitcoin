It contains two distinct sections. The first lists the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham to his legal father Joseph, his mother's husband. The second part, beginning at verse 18, provides an account of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Text Matthew 13,14-20 on verso side of Papyrus 1 (~250 AD). The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 25 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (~325‚Äì350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (~330‚Äì360; complete) *Codex Washingtonianus (~400) *Codex Bezae (~400; extant verses 21-34) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 3-34) The genealogy The genealogy in Matthew was traditionally illustrated by a Jesse Tree showing the descent of Jesus from Jesse, father of King David Matthew 1:1-17 Matthew opens with the genealogy of Jesus, set out in three stages each of 14 generations: from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile and thence to Jesus' legal father Joseph, the husband of Mary his mother. The list opens and closes with a significant title for Jesus as \\"Jesus Christ\\" (1:1, 1:18; rarely used in the Gospel of Matthew). The opening words of the gospel show that it is written by a Jew for Jewish readers.Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers on Matthew 1, accessed 21 November 2016 The genealogy demonstrates that Jesus comes from the seed of Abraham and belongs to the House of David, and thus is their heir. The Gospel also asserts Jesus is, in fact, the Son of God, and Joseph is, thus, not actually Jesus' father. Legally, however, Joseph is Jesus' father and some scholars contend legal parentage is of the most importance. Ra McLaughlin argues that the central event in this passage is actually the adoption of Jesus by Joseph (signified by his naming of the child), which alone makes Jesus eligible to be the messiah from the line of David.McLaughlin, R., \\"The Adoption of Jesus: On Matthew 1:1-25\\" Reformed Perspectives Magazine, vol. 7, no. 35, 2005 The section begins with Abraham who is traditionally regarded as the ancestor of all the families of the Earth. It then runs through the prominent Old Testament figures of Isaac, Jacob, and Judah. The passage also references Judah's brothers who have no actual place in the genealogy. Gundry contends they are included because the author of Matthew is trying to portray the people of God as a brotherhood.Gundry, Robert H. Matthew: a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art, Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. There are several problems with the genealogies. The list here is significantly different from that found in Luke 3, where the list from the Babylonian captivity to Jesus' grandfather is wholly different. Matthew skips several names in portions where the genealogy is well-known from other sources, Jehoiakim is left out in 1:11 and four names are dropped from 1:8. Unlike most Biblical genealogies, Matthew's genealogy mentions several figures not in the direct line of descent, including four women, Tamar, Ruth, Bathsheba, and Rahab. Several theories address these questions. One popular theory is that, while Matthew provides the genealogy of Joseph and his father Jacob, Luke details the genealogy of Joseph's father-in-law Heli. Thus, Matthew focuses on Jesus' royalty lineage, rather than precise biological line (that possibly used by Luke) which he did not have access to. McLaughlin argues that because Jeconiah must be counted in two different groups in order to make the \\"fourteen generations\\" of 1:17, the genealogy here must be seen, not as a historically complete list, but as a literary device intended to highlight four significant events in Israelite history: the covenant with Abraham, the covenant with David, the Babylonian exile, and especially the reign of the messiah, which is the subject of the rest of the Gospel. Other scholars doubt these theories, and most who do not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible believe one or both of the pair are historically inaccurate. Luke's genealogy contains a more realistic number of names, given the time period, and Matthew's list also lacks the papponymic naming used in the period. Gundry believes the latter part of Matthew's list is \\"a large figure of speech\\". He argues that at the time it was perfectly acceptable to fill gaps in a historical narrative with plausible fiction. Birth of Jesus chapter 2 in the Geneva Bible (16th century). Matthew 1:18-25 The second part of Matthew 1 relates some of the events leading up to the birth of Jesus (Matthew 2:1). While Luke and Matthew focus on varying details, the most important ideas, such as the Virgin Birth and the divine nature of Jesus, are shared. Unlike Luke's account, Matthew focuses on the character of Joseph and Joseph's discovery and concern over his betrothed's pregnancy \\"before they came together\\", and the message from an angel telling Joseph to stand by Mary, quoting Isaiah 7:14 presaging the birth of the Messiah. This section's focus on Joseph is unusual. Swiss theologian Eduard Schweizer suggests that Matthew is far more concerned with proving Jesus' legal status as the stepson of Joseph, and thus a legal heir of David, than with proving the Virgin Birth. Schweizer feels this evinces Matthew's intended audience was of predominantly Jewish background, a pattern continuing throughout the Gospel, and the importance Old Testament references provides further evidence.Schweizer, Eduard, The Good News According to Matthew, Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975 Hill feels the quote from Isaiah was, in fact, the central element and believes the entire last part of the chapter was written to prove that Jesus' story matches the prophecy.Hill, David, The Gospel of Matthew. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981, Stendhal, by contrast, sees the second section of this chapter as a large footnote to the last line of the genealogy, a lengthy explanation of why Joseph is merely the husband of Jesus' mother but also why Jesus is an heir to David. McLaughlin argues that Matthew recognizes that the prophecy Isaiah gave to King Ahaz in the referenced Old Testament passage concerned a virgin living at that time (namely, Isaiah's wife) and a child (namely, Maher- Shalal-Hash-Baz), who was born as a sign to Ahaz (Isaiah 8:1), and he argues that Matthew saw the act of salvation of which Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz's birth was a sign as a \\"type\\" (or pre-figuring) of the salvation that would come through the virgin and child he was describing (namely, Mary and Jesus). Other commentators feel this section should be attached to the second chapter, which is divided into four sections, each focusing on an Old Testament passage, and this portion is often seen as the first of those sections.France, R.T. The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: Inter- Varsity, 1985. VersesFull text In the King James Version this chapter reads: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning. It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD), The term is derived from the Latin scrupulum, a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the conscience. Scrupulosity was formerly called scruples in religious contexts, but the word scruple now commonly refers to a troubling of the conscience rather than to the disorder. As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder. It is sometimes called \\"scrupulousness\\", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.  Presentation  In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive‚Äìcompulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.  Treatment  Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular. ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person obsessed by blasphemous thoughts while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible. However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. Cognitive therapy may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible. Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP. Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety. Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity. Although serotonergic medications are often used to treat OCD, studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made. Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity. Available data suggest that the prevalence of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce. There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0‚Äì7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40‚Äì60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.  History  John Moore (shown ) was the first to describe the disorder, calling it \\"religious melancholy\\". Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term scruples in a religious context, e.g. by Catholics, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion. Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32‚Äì47. This use of the term dates to the 12th century. Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, wrote \\"After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws ... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned ... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy.\\" Alphonsus Liguori, the Redemptorists' founder, wrote of it as \\"groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'\\". Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori, Th√©r√®se of Lisieux stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing \\"One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible.\\" Martin Luther also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word enim (\\"for\\") during the Eucharist was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent. Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and John Bunyan are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological. Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by John Moore, who called it \\"religious melancholy\\" and said it made people \\"fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it\\". Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor R.P. Duguet, and other religious authorities and figures attempted to develop solutions and coping mechanisms; the monthly newsletter Scrupulous Anonymous, published by the followers of Liguori, has been used as an adjunct to therapy. In the 19th century, Christian spiritual advisors in the U.S. and Britain became worried that scrupulosity was not only a sin in itself, but also led to sin, by attacking the virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25 per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels. Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.

Early military career Worth at the Battle of Monterrey, 1846 Monument on Worth Square Worth was commissioned as a first lieutenant in March 1813,Arvin W. Turner. Worth, William Jenkins, Handbook of Texas Online serving as an aide to (then brigadier general) Winfield Scott during the war, and developing a friendship with him. He later named his son Winfield Scott Worth. He distinguished himself at the battles of Chippewa and Lundy's Lane during the Niagara campaign. In the latter battle, he was seriously wounded by grapeshot in the thigh. He was not expected to survive, but after a year's confinement, he emerged with the breveted rank of Major‚Äîthough he would remain lame for the rest of his life. Also as a brevet Major Worth uttered his most famous words that are now inscribed in West Point's \\"Bugle Notes\\", a book of knowledge all cadets must know by heart. They are as follows: After the war he was Commandant of Cadets at West Point and would rise to the rank of Colonel in 1838 when he was put in command of the newly created Eighth Infantry Regiment. Using his own tactics he successfully prosecuted the Second Seminole War in Florida and was made a brevet brigadier general in 1842. Eventually, he convinced Secretary of War John C. Spencer to allow the remaining Indians in the territory to confine themselves to an unofficial reservation in southwest Florida, and declared an official end to the war in August of that year.Mahon: 315‚Äì316 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began Worth was serving under Zachary Taylor in Texas and negotiated the surrender of the Mexican city of Matamoros. He next commanded the 2nd Regular Division, Army of Occupation at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846.Wallace, Edward S. General William Jenkins Worth: Monterey's Forgotten Hero. Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, 1953. In 1847, Worth was transferred to his old friend Winfield Scott's army and placed in command of the 1st Division. Monument on Worth Square in Manhattan Worth Square He took part in the Siege of Veracruz and engaged in the battles of Cerro Gordo, Contreras and Churubusco. In Mexico City Scott ordered Worth to seize the Mexican works at the Molino del Rey. Worth and Scott's friendship came to a head when Scott refused to allow Worth to modify the attack and the battle caused the 1st Division severe casualties, much to Worth's dismay. Worth later renamed his son Winfield Scott to William. He next led his division against the San Cosme Gate at Mexico City. When U.S. forces entered Mexico City, Worth personally climbed to the roof of the National Palace and took down the Mexican flag replacing it with the Stars and Stripes. For his service at the Battle of Chapultepec, the United States Congress awarded him with a sword of honor. In 1847 he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. Postwar service and death In 1848, Worth was approached by a group of Cuban Freemasons known as the Havana Club, composed of sugar plantation owners and aristocrats, who advocated the overthrow of the Spanish colonial government in Cuba. The Havana Club sent a college professor Ambrosio Jos√© Gonzales to entreat Worth to lead an invasion of Cuba. Knowing Worth was also a Freemason, Gonzales greeted the war hero with the Masonic secret handshake, and subsequently offered him three million dollars to lead an invasion force of five thousand American veterans of the Mexican-American War against the Spanish in Cuba. Worth accepted the offer, but before the plot could be concluded, he was transferred by the War Department to Texas.Jeffers, H. Paul. The Freemasons in America: Inside the Secret Society. New York, NY: Citadel Press, 2006., He was in command of the Department of Texas when he died of cholera in 1849 in San Antonio. Worth Square Worth's remains were reinterred in a 51-foot granite monument on Worth Square on a traffic island between Fifth Avenue and Broadway at 25th Street in New York City's borough of Manhattan. The Worth Monument is the second oldest monument in New York. The monument was designed and built by James G. Batterson in 1857.Reports on the Erection of a Monument to the Memory of William Jenkins Worth, Late Major- General of the United States Army. New York: C.W. Baker, printer, 1857. The monument‚Äôs central decorative bands are inscribed with battle sites significant in Worth‚Äôs career and attached to its front is a bronze equestrian relief of Worth. Each spike of the cast-iron fence surrounding the memorial is topped with a plumed helmet, reflective of the plumed helmet Worth is shown wearing in the memorial. The American painter Thomas Hart Benton depicted the obelisk in New York, Early Twenties. Worth Street (Manhattan) at the southern end of Little Italy was named in his honor. The north side fence was removed around 1940 to accommodate an above-ground utility shed which services the water supply system pipes beneath the monument. Legacy The cities of Fort Worth and Lake Worth in Texas, the villages of Worth in Illinois and Worthville in Kentucky, and the counties of Worth in Georgia, Missouri, and Iowa are all named in his honor.

Translation of M. H. Shakir. The fruits of Zaqqum are shaped like devils' heads (Qur'an 37:62-68). Some Islamic scholars believe in a literal meaning of this tree grown in fire, showing the inverted flora of hell. The inhabitants of hell are forced to eat the tree's fruits, which tears their bodies apart and releases bodily fluids as a punishment. According to Umar Sulayman Al-Ashqar, a leading Salafi scholar and professor at the University of Jordan, once the palate of the sinners is satiated, the fruit in their bellies churns like burning oil. Other scholars suggest the tree is grown by the seeds of the evil deeds of the sinners, therefore the devilish fruits are the fruits of their bad actions during lifetime; as Ibn Arabi stated, the tree stands for the arrogant self.Sarah R. bin Tyeer The Qur‚Äôan and the Aesthetics of Premodern Arabic Prose Springer 2016 page 82Muhittin Akgul The Qu'ran in 99 Questions Tughra Books 2008 Botany The name zaqqum has been applied to the species Euphorbia abyssinica by the Beja people in eastern Sudan.Trees in the Koran and the Bible, L.

It was originally established in 1797. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. On 29 April 2008, Aviva announced that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out and disappear over a period of two years, on the grounds that a consistent Aviva brand would bring \\"global impact\\".Aviva On 1 June 2009, Norwich Union was rebranded as Aviva.Norwich Union gears up for name change History 19th- century Norwich Union fire insurance mark on Hugglescote Wesleyan Chapel, Leicestershire, England Norwich Union offices in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England Norwich Union was founded in 1797 in Norwich, when 36-year-old merchant and banker Thomas Bignold formed the \\"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\\", a mutual society owned by the policyholders who received a share of the profits.Aviva: Timeline This in turn became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office. In 1808 Thomas Bignold established a second mutual, the Norwich Union Life Insurance Society. The Fire Society demutualised in 1821 when it absorbed the Norwich General Assurance Company. In common with many insurance companies against fire loss, they operated their own fire brigades to protect (only) the society's policyholders whose buildings were identified by \\"fire insurance marks\\". It was not until 1929 that the Fire Society gave up its last private brigade, in Worcester, to the municipal authorities.Insurance Fire Brigades 1680‚Äì1929; The Birth of the Fire Service: The Fire Insurance Brigades 1680‚Äì1925 [Illustrated] (Paperback) by Brian Wright (Author) In 1997, its bicentenary year, Norwich Union demutualised and floated as a public limited company on the London Stock Exchange. Although it sold general insurance, motoring, healthcare and life policies‚Äîits wide range of products leading indirectly to its slogan no-one protects more‚Äîit was listed on the markets as a life company, and in later years was under some pressure from analysts to shed its general insurance arm. In 2000, Norwich Union merged with CGU, which itself was formed from the merger of General Accident and Commercial Union in October 1998. The Norwich Union had tried to take over General Accident over 100 years earlier. CGU also offered a broad range of life and general insurance products, with a stronger global presence than the heavily UK-based Norwich Union. Upon merging they formed the group CGNU which went on to become the Aviva group. In 2005, there were still two companies operating in the UK under the Aviva umbrella that used the Norwich Union brand: Norwich Union Insurance (NUGI) and Norwich Union Life (NUL). Following an extensive pilot, in October 2006, Norwich Union introduced a novel type of auto insurance called Pay as You Drive (PAYD). A GPS receiver and mobile technology are placed in a car and risk factors (time of day, distance, mileage) are monitored. The information is transmitted back to the insurance company. Drivers using their vehicles at low-risk times of day or on low-risk roads or driving low mileage get a discount on their motor insurance premiums. There are several business method patents covering this invention. The Pay as You Drive service was withdrawn in 2008 due to lower-than-expected volumes of new business.Surveillance fears force Norwich to scrap Pay as you drive Norwich Union supported a European public service ad campaign against careless driving at too great a speed. The ad campaign is known as \\"The Faster the Speed, the Bigger the Mess\\".Daily Motion: video extract Customer service In December 2007 Norwich Union was fined ¬£1.26m by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) after customers with life assurance policies were put at a small risk of fraud. The FSA said the company had failed to deal with the issue properly even when it had been alerted to the problem. After discovering an overcharging error that dated back to 2001, Norwich Union agreed to compensate their clients with a cheque for ¬£300 each, due to charges that exceeded the 1% cap imposed by the government. The final amount of compensation is expected to exceed ¬£11 million.Norwich Union pension customers to get ¬£300 refund Daily Telegraph, 10 November 2008 International operations In Canada, Norwich Union was well known as a direct marketer of life insurance products, often promoted through frequently repeated television advertisements. Most famous was a spot beginning with the phrase, \\"It's Patrick! He took out life insurance.\\"Norwich Union Commercial 1990 posted on YouTube Following the Norwich/CGU merger, this unit was sold to American International Group and renamed AIG Assurance, which decided to drop the \\"Patrick\\" ads. The unit was then resold in 2009 to Bank of Montreal, and is now known as BMO Insurance. In Australia the operations of Norwich Union Australia were rebranded as Aviva in October 2003. The company then consisted of three businesses: life insurance, fund manager Portfolio Partners (which reports directly to London) and the master trust/financial planning service Navigator.

The four leaders were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Sharon and Abbas explicitly undertook to cease all violence against each other's peoples, marking a formal end to the Al-Aqsa Intifada and to move on in the Road map for peace process. Sharon also agreed to release 900 Palestinian prisoners of the 7,500 being held at the time, and to withdraw from West Bank towns. However, the violence continued into the following years, though suicide bombings decreased significantly. By the spring of 2005, 500 of the prisoners had been released, but after Qassam rocket attacks on Sderot on 5 May, Sharon stopped the release of the remaining 400, saying the Palestinian Authority needs to rein in the militants. Background to the summit The Al-Aqsa Intifada, which began in September 2000, left over 5,000 Palestinian and Israeli casualties and took extensive toll on both economies and societies. The cycle of violence persisted throughout this period, except for the short-lived Hudna in mid-2003. Neither side was willing to negotiate until there was a halt to violence. Yasser Arafat, the man thought by many to have engineered the intifada and to have kept it alive, died in November 2004. The Palestinian presidential election to elect Arafat's successor was held on 9 January 2005 and confirmed Mahmoud Abbas as President of the Palestinian Authority. His initial efforts were to bring order to the anarchy of the Palestinian territories and halt attacks against Israel. Ariel Sharon changed his attitude towards negotiations and ordered a significant reduction of Israeli military activity in the Palestinian territories and took many measures to help Palestinian civilians. These trust-building steps, together with renewed security coordination between the two sides and the backing of the United States, Jordan and Egypt led to agreement on holding of the summit. The summit The summit began with a series of meetings between Sharon and Mubarak, King Abdullah and Abbas. Later, all leaders except King Abdullah read statements reaffirming their commitment to continued efforts to stabilize the situation and to move on in the Road map for peace process. Sharon and Abbas explicitly included an intended cessation of all violent activity against each other's peoples in their closing statements, marking a formal end to the Al- Aqsa Intifada. Sharon also agreed to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw from West Bank towns. Media coverage post-summit A 2007 report entitled \\"Quiet, We're Disengaging!

Saltz has been a visiting critic at The School of Visual Arts, Columbia University, Yale University, and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the New York Studio Residency Program. Early life Saltz was born and grew up in the inner city in Chicago, before moving to the suburbs after his father invented the Dexter Hand Sewing Machine. His mother died when he was ten years old, shortly after he recalls a memorable trip to the Chicago Institute of Art, where he discovered, \\"Everything here is telling a story, everything here has a code, has a language‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to learn this whole language and I‚Äôm going to know the story.\\" Saltz attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1970 to 1975 before dropping out. He founded an artist-run gallery in the city before moving to New York at 26. Art criticism In an article in Artnet magazine, Saltz codified his outlook: \\"All great contemporary artists, schooled or not, are essentially self-taught and are de- skilling like crazy. I don't look for skill in art...Skill has nothing to do with technical proficiency...

We live in an open art world.\\" His humor, irreverence, self-deprecation and volubility have led some to call him the Rodney Dangerfield of the art world. He has expressed doubt about art critics' influence as purveyors of taste, saying they have little effect on the success of an artist's career. Nonetheless, ArtReview called him the 73rd most powerful person in the art world in their 2009 Power 100 list.Harrison, Helen A. \\"Artists Don't Get No Respect\\". Sag Harbor Express.

Life and career His parents, Robert Leighton and Marie Connor, were both writers. Marie was the more commercially successful and wrote adventure books (the best known being Convict 99) and also stories that were serialised in the Daily Mail. Her husband was the first literary editor of the Daily Mail and wrote adventure books for boys. Roland was brought up initially at \\"Vallombrosa\\" 40 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, North London, and later at \\"Heather Cliff\\" a large Edwardian house above the beach at Lowestoft. Leighton was a prizewinning classical scholar at Uppingham School; one pupil remembered Leighton using a wheelbarrow to recover his haul from the 1914 school prize-giving. His hope was to one day become the editor of a national newspaper. At the school, Leighton did not have a wide circle of friends as he was regarded as being rather cold and conceited by his peers. He did however become a close friend of Edward, brother of future author and journalist Vera Brittain, and Victor Richardson, the son of a Hove dentist.; Mrs Leighton called the friends \\"the three musketeers\\". At Uppingham he was acting cadet officer in the Junior Division, Officers Training Corps. On leaving Uppingham, Leighton applied to Oxford University and was awarded the classical postmastership at Merton College, Oxford. In the meantime, he had developed an interest in reading poetry and writing his own verse whilst at Uppingham. Leighton subsequently used the medium of poetry to express his burgeoning love for Vera Brittain, Edward's sister. He first met Vera when visiting Edward at Uppingham in 1913 at the age of 19 . However, war was soon to intervene in their relationship. When the Great War (World War I) broke out in 1914, he was highly motivated to join the fighting by ideas of patriotism, honour and duty, and sought to get to the front. He first tried to get into the Royal Navy, but was turned down due to short-sightedness. After this experience, he procured a \\"general fitness\\" certificate from a local GP which did not make reference to his myopia, and was able to secure a commission as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment on 21 October 1914. From then on, Roland was only able to see Vera fleetingly during his brief periods of leave. He was promoted a lieutenant with the Worcestershire Regiment on 26 March 1915. Leighton served with the Worcestershire Regiment in France, and was engaged in the fighting around Ypres in Belgium. Vera Brittain became his fianc√©e in August 1915. An analysis of his letters reveals that he quickly became unhappy and disillusioned by his experiences at the front describing it as \\"a mere trade\\". He converted to Roman Catholicism while at the Front in late 1915. This event, which took place in the summer of 1915, according to his fianc√©e, was unknown to anyone of his family or to her. His funeral took place according to Catholic rites. (Brittain p. 216). In December of 1915, he was shot by a sniper while inspecting the wire, in bright moonlight, in front of a trench at H√©buterne, France. He sustained a catastrophic abdominal and spinal injury. While still on the battlefield, he said simply, \\"They got me in the stomach and it's bad,\\" before he was rendered semi-conscious by morphine. Leighton underwent emergency abdominal surgery at Louvencourt. However, he survived only a short time, dying of his wounds on 23 December 1915 at the age of 20 (his gravestone incorrectly states that he was 19). His burial service was held at Louvencourt church. He is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at Louvencourt, near Doullens.Roland Aubrey Leighton on CWGC Brittain's biographer Mark Bostridge has reported that Leighton's grave is often covered by violets in tribute to a poem he wrote for his fianc√©e: :\\"Violets from Plug Street wood, :Sweet, I send you oversea. :(It is strange they should be blue, :Blue, when his soaked blood was red, :For they grew around his head: :It is strange they should be blue.) :Violets from Plug Street Wood, :Think what they have meant to me‚Äî :Life and hope and love and you. :(And you did not see them grow, :where his mangled body lay, :Hiding horror from the day; :Sweetest it was better so) :Violets from oversea, :To your dear, far, forgetting land, :These I send in memory, :Knowing you will understand\\". Roland's final poem, which was found in his clothes after his death was \\"Hedauville\\". Brittain found the poem unsettling and difficult to fully understand. It seemed as if perhaps Roland was predicting his own death in \\"Hedauville\\", and foresaw a different life for Vera, with a new love, Hedauville. Nov 1915. The sunshine on the long white road That ribboned down the hill, The velvet clematis that clung Around your window sill, Are waiting for you still. Again the shadowed pool shall break, In dimples round your feet, And when the thrush sings in your wood, Unknowing you may meet Another stranger, sweet. And if he is not quite as old As the boy you used to know, And less proud too, and worthier, You may not let him go. (And daisies are truer than passion flowers) It will be better so. Vera Brittain wrote several poems commemorating Leighton's life which were published in her 1918 work, Verses of a V.A.D., and her later volume Because you died. She later immortalised him and her brother Edward in her famous memoir Testament of Youth. Many of Leighton's letters are included in Letters from a Lost Generation, a compilation of her wartime letters, edited by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge, published in 1998. Brittain's Chronicle of Youth, which contains her diaries 1913‚Äì1917, includes entries about Leighton and their relationship, excerpts from his letters from the battlefield and his poetry. His mother anonymously published a memoir of him called Boy of My Heart in 1916. Leighton is commemorated on the war memorial in the school chapel at Uppingham and, although he did not take up his place at Merton College, his name is on the war memorial there. He is also remembered along with Edward Brittain and Victor Richardson on the war memorial at St Barnabas Church, Hove; this was the church attended by the Richardson family. His brother Evelyn, five years his junior, joined the Royal Navy, reaching the rank of captain; he was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 and awarded the OBE. His sister Clare Leighton became a talented woodcut artist; she wrote a biography of her mother, Tempestuous Petticoat. Popular culture In the 1979 TV adaptation of Testament of Youth Leighton was played by Peter Woodward, with Cheryl Campbell taking the part of Vera. The role was taken by Rupert Graves in the 1998 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Letters from a Lost Generation and by Christian Brassington in BBC 1's documentary Vera Brittain: A Woman in Love and War in 2008. In the 2014 feature film of Testament of Youth, Leighton was played by Kit Harington, alongside Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain. Mark Hollis' 1998 song \\"A Life (1895-1915)\\", included on his one and only solo album, was inspired by Leighton's life and death. Hollis stated about the song, \\"That was someone born before the turn of the century ‚Ä¶ and dying within one year of the First World War at a young age. It was based on Vera Brittain's boyfriend. It's the expectation that must have been in existence at the turn of the century, the patriotism that must've existed at the start of the war and the disillusionment that must've come immediately afterwards. It's the very severe mood swings that fascinated me.\\" The song correspondingly contains a variety of styles, tempos, and instrumentations.

Dragobete was the son of Baba Dochia, which stands for the main character in the myth related to spring arrival and the end of the harsh winter. Due to his endless kindness he was chosen ‚Äì according to some sources, by Virgin Mary ‚Äì to be the Guardian of Love. The day is particularly known as \\"the day when the birds are betrothed\\". It is around this time that the birds begin to build their nests and mate. On this day, considered locally the first day of spring, boys and girls gather vernal flowers and sing together. Maidens used to collect the snow that lay on the ground in many villages and then melt it, using the water in magic potions throughout the rest of the year. Those who take part in Dragobete customs are supposed to be protected from illness, especially fevers, for the rest of the year. If the weather allows, girls and boys pick snowdrops or other early spring plants for the person they are courting. In Romania, Dragobete is known as a day for lovers, rather like Valentine's Day. It is a common belief in some parts of Romania that, during this celebration, stepping over a partner's foot leads to the dominant role in the relationship. Dragobete customs vary from region to region. In the countryside there is an old tradition with girls and boys going into the woods to pick flowers. When they return home, the traditions says that boys were running after girls to kiss them. If the girl liked the boy she lets him kiss her. There is a saying in Romania that makes a lot of sense regarding this: \\"Dragobete kisses the girls\\". In neighbouring Bulgaria, the custom of stepping over one's partner's feet traditionally takes place during weddings with the same purpose, but it is not believed to be connected to Dragobete.

This first AGM was attended by 98 members and supporters. The first Newsletter was published in January 1981. A development officer was employed at around this time, and the first branches were established in Oxford and Bromley in 1980 and 1981 respectively. One of the Society's earliest contributions to research, as described in the Newsletter of January 1981, was a request for brain tissue donations to help support research studies.Foundation  Alzheimers.org.uk Through the 1980s and 1990s the society continued to grow, with volunteer committees establishing branches across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Environmental record Logotype of Nippon Oil While developing the Rang Don Oil Field and Helang Gas Field NOEX, part of the Nippon Oil Corporation, conducted environmental impact assessments. These assessments helped them implement management plans based on the results of the assessments, specifically, how to reduce the impact of the fields on surrounding sea areas.\\"Nippon Oil Measures to Protect the Environment \\" In 2005, Nippon Oil and Ebara-Ballard announced they were going to start field testing a 1 kW household proton-exchange membrane fuel cell system that uses coal oil as fuel. It was the world's first household test with the system. The system achieves a greater power-generation efficiency than normal heating. The system can operate in temperatures as low as -10 deg C.\\"Nippon Announces Fuel Cell \\" In 2007, Nippon Oil was the recipient of the Nippon Keidanren Chairman's Prize in recognition of its achievements in a number of areas.

However, the ending mir, found in many Slavic names, has developed from the Old Slavic term *meru which meant 'large, great, greatly'.

History The Greenwich and Johnsonville Railway (G&J;) was incorporated in the late part of the 19th century, and built a rail line between Greenwich and Johnsonville, New York.Nestle, David F., \\"Rails Along the Battenskill: A History of the Greenwich & Johnsonville Railway\\" (1983). Most of the alignment of the former G&J; is Washington County Route 74. Around 1900, G&J; became a subsidiary of the Delaware and Hudson Railway (D&H;). The D&H; built a branch from Greenwich to Greenwich Junction where it connected to the D&H;'s Washington Branch built circa 1860. Following the 1980 closure of the Georgia Pacific pulp and paper mill in Thomson, New York, the D&H; planned to abandon the G&J; along with the adjoining Washington Branch, which ran from Eagle Bridge, New York to Castleton, Vermont. In 1982, Mohawk-Hudson Transportation, owned by Ron Crowd, purchased the railroad from the D&H;, forming the Batten Kill Railroad. Crowd had the distinction of being the first African-American to own and operate a railroad in the United States.\\"Ronald Edward Crowd\\", \\"Post-Star\\", April 1, 2008; accessed July 14, 2011. While initially financially successful, a series of national railroad strikes in the mid-1980s left the railroad in a less profitable state. In 1994, the railroad was turned over to NE New York Rail, a non-profit, and the BKRR remained the operator. Passenger excursions were started, but were terminated by late 2003 due to declining ridership.Youker, Daniel \\"Rail owner: 'My goal is survival'\\", \\"Post-Star\\", August 16, 2002, accessed July 14, 2011. In November 2008, William (Bill) Taber purchased the Batten Kill from Mohawk Transportation and the estate of the late Ron Crowd. Taber is the current President and CEO of the railroad. Route The Batten Kill's sole interchange location is in Eagle Bridge, New York where it connects to the main line of Pan Am Railways (formerly Guilford Transportation and the Boston & Maine). However the Batten Kill actually interchanges with the Delaware and Hudson (D&H;), now Canadian Pacific, which has trackage rights on Pan Am. The line runs north from Eagle Bridge, through the villages of Cambridge, New York and Shushan, New York, to Greenwich Junction. From there, a short remnant of the D&H; Washington Branch continues north into the village of Salem, New York. This north-south component of the line is paralleled by NY Route 22. The other route from the junction continues west to the village of Greenwich, paralleled by NY Route 29. The line running west from Greenwich to Thomson, New York, is out of service. In Greenwich, the railroad maintains a small engine house and the former G&J; depot as an office.

She is sometimes imagined as ‚Äúan old woman who insults the month of March when she goes out with a herd of sheep or goats.‚ÄùAndreas Johns, Baba Yaga: the ambiguous mother and witch of the Russian folktale (Peter Lang, 2004), 76. Supposedly the name originates from the Byzantine calendar, which celebrates the 2nd-century martyr-saint Eudokia of Heliopolis (Evdokia) on March 1. The Romanian Dokia personifies mankind's impatience in waiting for the return of spring.  The legend of Dragomir  Baba Dochia has a son, called Dragomir, who is married. Dochia ill-treats her daughter-in-law by sending her to pick up berries in the forest at the end of February. God appears to the girl as an old man and helps her in her task. When Dochia sees the berries, she thinks that spring has come back and leaves for the mountains with her son and her goats. She is dressed with twelve lambskins, but it rains on the mountain and the skins get soaked and heavy. Dochia has to get rid of the skins and when frost comes she perishes from the cold with her goats. Her son freezes to death with a piece of ice in his mouth as he was playing the flute.  The legend of Dragobete and the Babele myth  Another version of this story is that Dragobete marries a girl against Baba Dochia's will. Angry with her son's decision, she sends her daughter in law to wash some black wool in the river and tells her not to come back until the wool has turned white. The girl tries to wash it, but the wool would not change color. In despair and with her hands frozen from the cold water of the river, the girl starts crying, thinking that she would never be able to see her loved husband again. Then Jesus sees her from the sky and feels sorry for her, so he gives her a red flower telling her to wash the wool with that. As soon as she washes the wool as told by Jesus, it turns white so the girl happily returns home. When Baba Dochia hears about her story, she gets angry and thinks spring has come, since the man (who the girls had not recognized as being Jesus) was able to offer her a flower. She leaves for the mountains dressed in nine coats. As the weather changes fast on the mountain, she starts throwing away her coats, one by one, until she is left with no coat. But as soon as she drops her last coat, the weather changes again and Baba Dochia is frozen on the mountain.  Babele myth  A folk myth associates the 9 days from March 1 to March 9 with the 9 coats she's shedding. Her spirit is haunting every year around that time, bringing snowstorms and cold weather before the spring sets in. Women use to pick a day out of these 9 beforehand, and if the day turns out to be fair, they'll be fair in their old days, and if the day turns out to be cold, they'll turn bitter when older. In Romanian language 'babele' is the plural of 'baba', the hag or the old woman. Dochia is sometimes depicted as a proud woman who teases the month of March, who in return gets its revenge by taking some days from February.  Legend of Dochia and Trajan  In other sources, Dochia was the daughter (or sister) of Decebalus, King of the Dacians. When the Roman Emperor Trajan was conquering part of the Dacian territory, Dochia seeks refuge in the Carpathian Mountains in order to avoid marrying him. She disguises herself as a shepherd and her people as a herd. When she realizes that there is no escape she asks the supreme Dacian god Zamolxes to turn her and her herd into stone,Gheorghe Asachi, Dochia »ôi Traian thus becoming Babele.

The BHA seeks to encourage the use of homeopathy within general and specialist healthcare and provides a listing of homeopathic practitioners. From 1902, the BHA co-sponsored the Missionary School of Medicine, a school of medicine for medical missionaries. The charity also campaigns for more homeopathy in Britain's National Health Service (NHS). Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine in which quack practitioners claim to treat patients using highly dilutedUK Parliamentary Committee Science and Technology Committee - \\"Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy\\" preparations that they baselessly claim to cause healthy people to exhibit symptoms that are similar to those exhibited by the patient. The BHA has been accused of misrepresenting evidence submitted to the House Of Commons Evidence Check On Homeopathy. Analysis of the evidence submitted by the British Homeopathic Association contains many examples of quote mining, where the conclusions of scientific papers were selectively quoted to make them appear to support the efficacy of homeopathic treatment. For example, one paper's conclusion was reported as \\"There is some evidence that homeopathic treatments are more effective than placebo\\" without the immediately following caveat \\"however, the strength of this evidence is low because of the low methodological quality of the trials. Studies of high methodological quality were more likely to be negative than the lower quality studies.\\"My Response to the British Homeopathic Association, Martin Robbins, The Lay Scientist, February 9, 2010 NHS England's public consultation in July 2017 \\"to drive out wasteful and ineffective drug prescriptions\\" resulted in the recommendation, in November 2017, that GPs should stop prescribing homeopathy to patients. The BHA \\"believed it had identified serious flaws\\" in the consultation's process and sought a judicial review, crowdfunding donations from supporters to support the legal action. In May 2018, Mr Justice Supperstone heard the case at the Royal Courts of Justice, London and, in June, he upheld NHS England's original decision to cease funding homeopathy. NHS England announced its intention to \\"reclaim ¬£120,000 in legal costs\\" from the BHA, arguing \\"that taxpayers should not pick up the tab for ‚Äútap water masquerading as medicine‚Äù\\".

History  The British Lung Foundation was established by Professor Sir Malcolm Green and a group of United Kingdom lung specialists in 1984. It has maintained strong links with the medical profession, as well as utilising the talents of people from all walks of life who share a determination to try to conquer lung disease in the 21st Century.  Breathe Easy  Breathe Easy is the support network of the British Lung Foundation. The network includes over 22,000 people, with over 200 support groups across the UK. Breathe Easy supports people through regular group meetings and offering help over the phone. There is also a pen-pal scheme, enabling people to make contact with others in the same situation. After a Breathe Easy campaign the Department of Health decided to undertake a complete review of the way oxygen is provided in England and Wales.  Campaigns  The British Lung Foundation campaigns for improvements in all areas of lung health. Breathe Easy supporters and members of the general public have worked with the BLF to ensure that these issues remain on the agenda at Westminster - and in the political chambers of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The BLF also campaigns to raise public awareness of lung disease and the impact it has on so many lives through poster campaigns, events and by maintaining a media profile.  Controversy  In June 2012 the British Lung Foundation released a report looking at the health impacts of smoking cannabis. (The report since appears to have been withdrawn. neither this report, nor the 2002 report A Smoking Gun?, can be found on the charity‚Äôs website. ) In one section, the report claimed \\"each cannabis cigarette increases the chances of developing lung cancer by as much as an entire packet of 20 tobacco cigarettes\\", and the claim received prominence in launch interviews with the then chief executive, Dame Helena Shovelton. Shovelton‚Äôs background was as administrator rather than scientist or researcher. The Independent, Wednesday 6 June, \\"Young cannabis users 'do not realise the huge danger to their health'\\" https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and- families/health-news/young-cannabis-users-do-not-realise-the-huge-danger-to- their-health-7818050.html \\"cannabis joint a day 'is as bad as 20 cigarettes'\\" http://www.metro.co.uk/news/901160-one-cannabis-joint-a-day-is-as-bad- as-20-cigarettes \\"Lack of awareness over cannabis risks 'alarming'\\" http://www.channel4.com/news/lack-of-awareness-over-cannabis-risks-alarming The report supported the claim by reference to a 2008 study, \\"Cannabis use and risk of lung cancer: a case-control study\\" (Aldington et al.), published in the European Respiratory Journal. That study had been challenged within the year and in the same journal, long before the BLF's claim. In a BBC radio interview on the day of the launch, \\"Call Kaye\\" Radio Scotland, Wed 6 June 2012. Kevin Williamson, author of \\"Drugs and the Party line\\", said that there was \\"no scientific basis to the claim\\", citing an earlier study of 2200 people published in Cancer Epidemiological Biomarkers and Prevention that had found \\"that the association of these cancers with marijuana, even long-term or heavy use, is not strong and may be below practically detectable limits\\", asking the charity's representative to cite the research that supported the charity's claim. When he declined to do so, Williamson accused the charity of \\"putting out bogus information\\" for \\"headline grabbing\\". On the same day, online journalist Keelan Balderson Keelan Balderson, \\"Mainstream Media Peddle Tired Cannabis Cancer Myth\\" http://wideshut.co.uk/mainstream-media-peddle-tired- cannabis-cancer-myth/ accused the charity of peddling \\"a long debunked myth\\". He claimed that it was not the first such incident, citing an earlier BLF statement that \\"3 joints are equal to 20 cigarettes\\", taken from the BLF‚Äôs 2002 Smoking Gun? report. David Nutt criticised the Foundation for \\"scaremongering\\". Peter Reynolds, leader of the political party Cannabis Law Reform (Clear), described the report as a \\"dangerously irresponsible mix of conjecture, extremist opinion and scaremongering\\". The British Lung Foundation responded by asserting that the report was based on sound research, and \\"references over 80 peer-reviewed research papers, is the most comprehensive report of its kind yet compiled, and has itself been peer-reviewed by independent experts\\". \\"Health risks of cannabis 'underestimated', experts warn\\" https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18283689  Research  On average, the British Lung Foundation invests one million pounds a year in research projects - all aiming to improve the diagnosis or treatment of lung conditions. As a direct result of research funded by the BLF, it is now possible to measure lung capacity in infants; the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation are demonstrable; lung transplants are more likely to be successful.  BLF COPD Project  The British Lung Foundation‚Äôs COPD Project is a three-year project which was set up in January 2007. The aims of the project are: * Raise awareness of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among the general public and health professionals. * Facilitate the sharing of information and expertise among patients, carers, health and social care practitioners, managers, commissioners and others. * Support the delivery of COPD campaigns and publications, developed and produced by the British Lung Foundation.  National Service Framework for COPD  The Department of Health will be launching a new National Service Framework (NSF) for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease towards the end of 2008. As Patient Advocate, the BLF‚Äôs Chief Executive, Helena Shovelton has been working closely with the Department of Health to support the development of the NSF for COPD. The BLF will be working closely with patients, carers, health and social care professionals and managers to develop activities to support the implementation of the NSF for COPD. The BLF will be developing ways of seeking the views of all of its partners via face to face forum meetings, email and the web.

The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; this is because guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway in steering the overall genre with his hard rock-influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly because many of them were dealing with alcohol addiction, or, in bassist Dee Dee Ramone's case, other drugs. The album begins with two cover songs, and features a third on Side 2. Lyrics circle various themes, while the structuring of the songs shifted towards hard rock, psychedelic rock. The album was deemed by critics to be an attempt to retreat to the band's roots and received mostly positive reviews. Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially, peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally. The singles released from the album did not chart either. This is the last album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album Brain Drain. It is the first album by the band to feature someone else other than Joey Ramone singing lead vocals on a song, with Dee Dee Ramone singing leads on the eleventh song \\"Time Bomb\\". Conception Compared to previous albums, Subterranean Jungle marked a shift back to the band's punk rock roots. Johnny Ramone felt as though the band needed to \\"be focused and stop worrying about getting played [on the radio] and just make a good record.\\" Lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, and the album was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.Bowe 2010, p. 66. Three of the four members of the band, Johnny being the exception, were facing issues with addiction. Both Joey and drummer Marky Ramone were dealing with alcoholism, while bassist Dee Dee Ramone was severely addicted to cocaine and was undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment. Since the Ramones' previous two releases had producers which proved disappointing to the members, they were skeptical of the upcoming producer; this would be Ritchie Cordell, with whom they also had issues.True 2005, p. 177.Porter 2004, p. 104. Marky relates: \\"I hated the production, I hated the producer.\\"True 2005, p. 180. The artwork for Subterranean Jungle features an image of the band inside a subway car. The photograph was taken by George DuBose at the subway station on 57th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. This cover concept was designed by Dubose, who suggested that since the B Sixth Avenue Express train stopped at the empty station for about 20 minutes.Leigh 2009, pp. 227‚Äì228. In the photograph, Marky is featured peering out the subway window‚ÄîMarky was positioned this way after Johnny asked DuBose to do so because \\"they were kicking him out of the band, but he didn't know it yet.\\" Marky recalled that he \\"liked that shot, but [he] knew something was up.\\" The internal conflicts during recording sessions would cause band members to fire Marky during the album's recording, consequently substituting him with drummer Billy Rogers on \\"Time has Come Today.\\" Johnny recounts, \\"We were having trouble with Mark because his drinking problem was really bad. So we did \\"Time Has Come Today\\" with a different drummer, Billy Rogers, from Walter Lure's band.\\"Ramone 2012, ch. 11. \\"Time Has Come Today\\" became the Ramones' only song to involve three drummers: Marky Ramone on the album credits, Billy Rogers on recording and Richie Ramone on the music video. Compositions and lyrics The album opens with two cover songs; the first, \\"Little Bit O' Soul\\", was originally written by John Carter and Ken Lewis and the second, \\"I Need Your Love\\", was first performed by Bobby Dee Waxman. Subterranean Jungle is the first Ramones' release to begin with a song not written by the band‚Äîthis track list structure was criticized by author Everett True, who said that it was \\"disorientating.\\" Johnny also thought that the fact that the album featured three covers was a bad idea, saying, \\"we shouldn't have, but I was happy with the guitar sound on it.\\" The album's third track, \\"Outsider\\", was written by Dee Dee and, in 2002, it was covered by Green Day on Shenanigans.Myers 2006, p. 189. \\"What'd Ya Do?\\" was track number four, and was described by music journalist Chuck Eddy as \\"crudely metallic.\\"Eddy 2011, p. 34. Eddy also deemed the next track, \\"Highest Trails Above\\", as \\"AOR- mystic.\\" \\"Somebody Like Me\\" was called a \\"full-on rock anthem\\" by Everett True, who went on to say that the lyrics contained \\"no-nonsense lines.\\"True 2005, p. 179. Side B of the album begins with \\"Psycho Therapy\\", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown into one of the Ramones' most popular songs. Dee Dee recalled: \\"I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [Johnny] was depressed about how things were going. He needed that song to get excited about the band again,\\" while Johnny stated, ‚ÄúI wanted to do a hardcore song to show the hardcore people that we can play as fast or faster than they can. Nobody plays faster than us.‚Äù The next track is another cover song, \\"Time Has Come Today\\", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a \\"garage\\" feel to it, as compared to the original. \\"My-My Kind of a Girl\\" was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as a \\"lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur.\\" Dee Dee's \\"Time Bomb\\", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be \\"more ridiculous than frightening.\\" The album concludes with \\"Everytime I Eat Vegetables It Makes Me Think of You\\", which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a \\"sing along.\\"Anderson 2006, ch. 5. Release and reception Subterranean Jungle was released by Sire Records in February 1983.Ramone 2002, p. 237. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music journalist Robert Christgau wrote that despite containing two inferior pieces (\\"Highest Trails Above\\" and \\"I Need Your Love\\"), the album is \\"more worthy of an audience than anything they've done in the '80s.\\" Stereo Review magazine strongly recommended it to \\"headbangers of all ages\\" as \\"a textbook Ramones album\\" whose unintellectual lyrics about mental illness and drug abuse \\"can actually be refreshing.\\" The album peaked at number 83 in on the Billboard 200 in the US, but failed to chart elsewhere. Neither of the album's singles‚Äî\\"Psycho Therapy\\" and \\"Time Has Come Today\\"‚Äîcharted. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, author Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Subterranean Jungle the band's \\"most enjoyable record since Rocket to Russia,\\" and said that the producers \\"steered the Ramones back toward the '60s pop infatuation that provided the foundation for their early records.\\" He ended his review by stating that it may not be defined as the \\"strictest sense\\" of punk rock; however, he strongly suggested that the band had not sounded so \\"alive\\" since their earlier days. Douglas Wolk, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), was less enthusiastic and called it an \\"attempt at radio-friendly production,\\" with a series of cover songs that \\"almost recasts the group as an oldies act.\\"Wolk 2004, p. 675‚Äì6. In a 2004 interview for New York magazine, Johnny Ramone graded the album a \\"B\\" and said that he was pleased with its guitar sound, despite the three cover songs, while remarking \\"I was watching the Brewers-Cardinals World Series when we were recording it.\\" Track listing The following track listing can be verified through the Subterranean Jungle expanded edition liner notes.

Born into slavery, Dorsey enlisted in the United States Colored Troops and served through the last year of the war. Biography Dorsey was born a slave in 1836 in The Howard district of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, now Howard County. The Dorsey family held many large tobacco plantations in the region with many of their slave laborers taking on the name Dorsey. Decatur worked as a laborer at a time when the Enrollment Act allowed slaves to go in their place. Accounts differ and list him as an escaped slave, and freeman when he enlisted in the Union Army from Baltimore on March 22, 1864, at the age of 25. He joined Company B of the 39th United States Colored Infantry as a private, but was promoted to corporal less than two months later, on May 17.Hanna, pp. 29‚Äì30. On July 30, 1864, Dorsey took part in the Battle of the Crater in Petersburg, Virginia. With the Siege of Petersburg at a stalemate, Union forces hoped to break the city's defenses by detonating explosives in a tunnel dug beneath the Confederate lines and charging the enemy positions in the aftermath of the explosion. The blast blew a huge crater in the Confederate defenses, and white Union soldiers rushed in to attack. Men who entered the crater became trapped as the Confederates regrouped and began firing down at them. Dorsey's division, which had been held in reserve, was then ordered to reinforce the attack. Dorsey, serving as the 39th Regiment's color bearer, moved ahead of his unit during the advance and planted the flag on the Confederate fortifications. When the regiment was forced to pull back, he retrieved the flag and rallied his fellow soldiers for a second attack. In this second assault, the men of the 39th breached the Confederate works and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the defenders. They captured two hundred prisoners and two flags before being pushed back again and ordered to withdraw. Dorsey was promoted to sergeant on August 1, two days after the battle, and again to first sergeant on January 1, 1865. He was awarded the Medal of Honor on November 8, 1865, for his actions at the Battle of the Crater and was discharged from the Army a month later, on December 4, while in Wilmington, North Carolina. After the war he married and lived in Hoboken, New Jersey. He died there on July 11, 1891, at the approximate age of 55. He was buried at Flower Hill Cemetery in North Bergen, New Jersey.

Index data are system data distinct from user data, and consist primarily of pointers. Changes in a database (by insert, delete, or modify operations), may require indexes to be updated to maintain accurate user data accesses.Gerhard Weikum, Gottfried Vossen (2001): Transactional Information Systems Chapter 9, Elsevier, Index locking is a technique used to maintain index integrity. A portion of an index is locked during a database transaction when this portion is being accessed by the transaction as a result of attempt to access related user data. Additionally, special database system transactions (not user- invoked transactions) may be invoked to maintain and modify an index, as part of a system's self-maintenance activities. When a portion of an index is locked by a transaction, other transactions may be blocked from accessing this index portion (blocked from modifying, and even from reading it, depending on lock type and needed operation). Index Locking Protocol guarantees that phantom read phenomenon won't occur. Index locking protocol states: * Every relation must have at least one index. * A transaction can access tuples only after finding them through one or more indices on the relation * A transaction Ti that performs a lookup must lock all the index leaf nodes that it accesses, in S-mode, even if the leaf node does not contain any tuple satisfying the index lookup (e.g. for a range query, no tuple in a leaf is in the range) * A transaction Ti that inserts, updates or deletes a tuple ti in a relation r must update all indices to r and it must obtain exclusive locks on all index leaf nodes affected by the insert/update/delete * The rules of the two-phase locking protocol must be observed. Specialized concurrency control techniques exist for accessing indexes. These techniques depend on the index type, and take advantage of its structure. They are typically much more effective than applying to indexes common concurrency control methods applied to user data. Notable and widely researched are specialized techniques for B-trees (B-Tree concurrency controlGoetz Graefe (2010): \\"A survey of B-tree locking techniques\\" ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS), Volume 35 Issue 3, July 2010 (also HPL-2010-9, HP Laboratories).) which are regularly used as database indexes. Index locks are used to coordinate threads accessing indexes concurrently, and typically shorter-lived than the common transaction locks on user data.

It funds research to treat and cure CF and aims to ensure appropriate clinical care and support for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives Its objectives are: * To fund medical and scientific research into effective treatments and the development of a cure for cystic fibrosis; * To ensure appropriate clinical care for those with cystic fibrosis; * To provide information, advice, support and, where appropriate, financial assistance to anyone affected by cystic fibrosis. Research The aim of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust research is to understand, treat and cure cystic fibrosis. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust is the major funder of medical and scientific CF research in the UK. The Trust's research falls into two main categories: *Gene therapy - The Trust currently invests over ¬£3 million a year in a programme of research into gene therapy, in order to make it a clinical reality in the foreseeable future. Gene therapy aims to add a healthy copy of the faulty CF gene to the lung. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has brought together over 40 of the UK‚Äôs leading scientists to drive this research forward through the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium.UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium The scientists have developed a product which they plan to take to clinical trials in 2008. These trials will cost an additional ¬£4.7 million. *Medical and Scientific research ‚Äì The Trust supports research aimed at treating and curing the symptoms of CF and improving the lives of those with the condition. The Trust currently spends around ¬£1 million a year on this non-gene therapy research. Clinical care Cystic fibrosis is a complex disease requiring considerable specialist treatment. In the last fifteen years, the Trust has helped to set up and staff 45 specialist CF treatment centres throughout the UK. Since 1997, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust has invested over ¬£10 million in the NHS to improve clinical care for the 8,000 people in the UK with CF; helping fund doctors, nurses and multidisciplinary teams. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust sets the national standard on clinical care; provides and funds a UK CF Clinical Database; and measures levels of service provision. The Trust's Expert Patient Advisers (who all have CF) work with health providers and government to influence and improve the care of those with CF across the UK. Information, advice and support The Cystic Fibrosis Trust provides a confidential, 9-5 Monday to Friday helpline service for advice and support on all aspects of cystic fibrosis. The Trust also offers information and advice to those affected, along with their families and friends, schools and employers and anyone interested in cystic fibrosis. The Trust also advise families on benefits and, where appropriate, provides financial assistance and welfare grants. Community support The Cystic Fibrosis Trust receives donations and support from local communities .How to Help CF Trust In addition to the contributions, fund raising efforts have been undertaken by UK artist Jenny Wicks in 2009 with her photographic art exhibition, short documentary and book titled Root Ginger. The exhibition describes the recessive gene inheritance pattern that causes ginger, or red, hair - the same inheritance pattern that causes cystic fibrosis.Interview with Jenny Wick A portion of the proceeds from the exhibition and book sales will go to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.

Although the backronym of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association has been used by DEBRA UKDEBRA UK in the past, the organisation provides information, research funding and support for all forms of EB, not just dystrophic, which is one of three main sub-types of the condition; the others being EB simplex and junctional EB. The DebRA US organisation have continued to use the aforementioned acronym DEBRA for the Dystrophic EB Research Association of America since their formation in 1980. Work Epidermolysis bullosa is a genetic condition that in its most severe forms affects all of the body's linings, the skin, the linings of the mouth and oesophagus, and even the eyes. In its most severe forms the linings blister or rip away from the flesh under the lightest of frictions. For example, rolling over in bed can cause skin to tear away from behind the ears, and the sufferer may wake up with up to 30 blisters each morning. There is no treatment bar the lancing and draining of these blisters to stop their growth. Sufferers of the severest form die prematurely of skin cancer (their life expectancy is usually reduced by 30‚Äì40 years); in some, death occurs in infancy. Each day sufferers face a battle against fluid loss and infections due to open wounds. Blistering can also affect inner body linings, such as the mouth and throat. Sufferers of the severest forms have difficulties with eating due to the rawness in their mouths and often have to have a feeding tube fitted. EB has a number of distinct forms: in the least severe form, blistering is confined to the hands and feet. In more severe cases, the whole body is affected and wounds heal very slowly, giving rise to scarring, physical deformity and significant disability. In the UK DEBRA UK is the national charity that supports individuals and families affected by EB. There are at least 5,000 people living with this devastating condition in the UK and 500,000 people worldwide. DEBRA UK was founded in 1978 and provides an enhanced specialist EB nursing service, in partnership with the NHS, to deliver optimal healthcare to children and adults living with EB and community support staff to work directly with families. The charity also commissions world-leading research into the condition with the aim of finding effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure for EB. DEBRA UK has over 100 charity shops across the country run by combination of paid sales staff, volunteers, and people gaining work experience. Donations and proceeds from shops fund services for epidermolysis bullosa affected families and medical research into the condition. DEBRA UK's fundraising shops participate in the UK government's forced unpaid work programme where benefit claimants must work 20 to 40 hours per week uncompensated for periods that can be as long as six months. However, in 2015 DEBRA Trustee and current Vice Chairman Michael Jaega requested that DEBRA cease to take part in the program on the basis that DEBRA is a charity for disabled people and many of those disabled people, particularly those who suffer with EB, are unable to work due to the severe nature of their condition. The Workfare program was dropped by the government in 2017.BoycottWorkfare In the United States Debra of America was founded in 1980 by Arlene Pessar and her son, Eric Lopez, who was born with epidermolysis bullosa. About DebRA US Accessed April 2015 It is the only U.S. nonprofit organization that provides all-inclusive support to the EB community, through funding research for a cure and by providing free programs and services for those with EB.

History The journal was established in 1910 as an off-shoot of the Round Table movement, established the previous year to promote closer union between the United Kingdom and its self-governing colonies. It was initially subtitled, 'A Quarterly Review of the Politics of the British Empire'. Though some of those associated with the Round Table movement promoted Imperial Federation, a proposal to create a federated union in place of the existing British Empire, it was early on agreed that the journal 'should not come out flat-footed' in favour of constitutional change, and disagreements within the Round Table movement meant that it never did. It was founded by Lord Milner, former High Commissioner of South Africa, Lord Selborne, his successor, and members of \\"Milner's Kindergarten\\", who were associated with Milner through their work in the South African Civil Service, including: *Lionel Curtis *Philip Kerr - Liberal politician and, later, British Ambassador to United States *Geoffrey Dawson - Times journalist *Robert Brand They were soon joined by others including Leo Amery, F.S. Oliver, and Alfred Zimmern. In line with the developing idea of the British empire turning into a 'Commonwealth' promoting progressive self-government, which emerged from the 'studies' of the Round Table movement, the sub-title of the journal was changed in 1919 to 'A Quarterly Review of the Politics of the British Commonwealth'. Post-World War II, its subtitle was altered to 'A Quarterly Review of British Commonwealth Affairs' to reflect the changing nature of the Commonwealth and the lesser concentration on the domestic politics of Commonwealth member states. It became less a journal espousing a particular view and more a forum to exchange.opinions. Its sub-title was changed again in 1966, to 'The Commonwealth Quarterly'. The journal temporarily ceased in 1982 but was revived in 1983 with its current sub-title.  Journal content  Until 1966 all articles in the journal were anonymous, ostensibly so that people in positions of authority could write frankly without fear of the consequences. Most of the authors of articles prior to 1966 have been identified, and included Lord Balogh, Sir Evelyn Baring, Sir Alexander Cadogan, Isaac Deutscher, Lord Gladwyn, Lord Hankey, Elspeth Huxley, T.E. Lawrence, Sir Harry Luke, Ali A. Mazrui, Sir Lewis Namier, Lionel Robbins, Garfield Todd, Arnold Toynbee, and Sir Frederick Whyte. An index to all news stories and authors from 1910 to 1966 can be found here. From 1910 until the 1960s the journal carried regular news and analysis contributed by the Round Table groups in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. There were also regular articles from India, from 1918 the United States, from 1921 the Irish Free State, and after the Second World War Pakistan, Ceylon, Southern Rhodesia, and east Africa. These regular contributions all petered out in the 1960s, Since 1983 the journal has included a regular 'Commonwealth Update' section, summarising political and other developments across the Commonwealth. This was written for many years by Derek Ingram. The current Update editor is Oren Gruenbaum. Since 2012 the journal has included a regular 'Opinion' section, comprising shorter and usually policy-relevant pieces.  Other activities  The Round Table runs a website which provides news and commentary on Commonwealth topics, additional to what is published in the journal. The current editor is Debbie Ransome. The editorial board of the journal organises occasional conferences and public meetings on Commonwealth matters, usually including a one-day public conference in the UK before each CHOGM, and a two-day residential conference after. Reports are published on the website. In addition to the editorial board in the UK and an international advisory board drawn from across the Commonwealth, there are 'chapters' of the journal in Australia, Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia, which organise their own activities. The Round Table annually awards a Harry Hodson prize for a publishable article by anyone aged 30 years or younger as on 31 December of the year in which the article is submitted, and a Peter Lyon prize, for the best policy-relevant article published in each calendar year. From 2009 to 2018, the Round Table, in association with its publisher, Routledge, funded a Routledge/Round Table Studentship, for a student from a Commonwealth country other than the UK, studying for the MA in Human Rights at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, Since 2019 it has funded two annual Routledge/Round Table Commonwealth Studentships for doctoral students, one for a UK-based student and the other for a student from another Commonwealth country.

In 1970, the Council of the British Society of Gastroenterology first considered founding a charity to promote research in this speciality. A steering group, chaired by their President at the time, Dr Nelson Coghill, compiled facts and figures which established the importance of digestive disorders as a national health problem. Using this evidence as a basis for appeal, a Digestive Disorders Trust Fund was established. Dr Thomas Hunt, a founder member of the British Society of Gastroenterology, agreed to launch the new charity. He succeeded in attracting prominent lay and professional support. By 1974 its funds were sufficient to award the first research fellowship and to inaugurate the charity as a Foundation with Dr Hunt as its first President. On his death in 1980, Sir Francis Avery Jones took over the presidency for the next 12 years. Important landmarks during this time were the appointment of the first full-time director, expansion of research support and the development of the successful patient information programme.

A UK release followed on 9 October that year. Their fourth album, You Are Here was released in April 2008. On Jamie Macdonald's MySpace page, it was announced that the band were taking a hiatus, and that there were no future plans to get back together and record or play live again. Macdonald formed a new band called The Hug with Joel Cadbury on bass. Brett Shaw is currently a producer with his own studio in London and has been working with Florence and the Machine (Island), Rufus Wainwright (Decca), Paul Banks (Interpol), Daughter (4D), Still Corners (sub pop), Eliza Doolittle (EMI), Hawk House (Virgin EMI), Swim Deep (Chess Club), Clean Bandit featuring Jess Glynne (Atlantic). Macdonald has since released two solo EPs entitled The Head On Collider EP and The Shelf Life EP, both in 2010.

The first three, The Locomotives on Highways Act 1861, The Locomotive Act 1865 and the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878, contained restrictive measures on the manning and speed of operation of road vehicles; they also formalised many important road concepts such as vehicle registration, registration plates, speed limits, maximum vehicle weight over structures such as bridges, and the organisation of highway authorities. The most draconian restrictions and speed limits were imposed by the 1865 act (the \\"Red Flag Act\\"), which required all road locomotives, which included automobiles, to travel at a maximum of in the country and in the city, as well as requiring a man carrying a red flag to walk in front of road vehicles hauling multiple wagons. The 1896 Act removed some restrictions of the 1865 act and raised the speed to . The \\"Locomotives on Highways Act 1896\\" provided legislation that allowed the automotive industry in the United Kingdom to develop soon after the development of the first practical automobile (see History of the automobile). The last \\"locomotive act\\" was the \\"Locomotives Act 1898\\". Background The Highway Act 1835 and subsequent acts (Public Health Act 1875, Local Government Act 1888 and Local Government Act 1894) attempted to find satisfactory methods of maintaining roads since the UK turnpike trust system had failed following the UK railway boom. New steam powered road locomotives, some up to 9 feet (2.7 m) wide and 14 tons, were alleged to damage the highway while they were being propelled at \\"high speeds\\" of up to . There is evidence that the steam carriages' brakes and their wide tyres caused less damage to the roads than horse-drawn carriages because of the absence of horses' hooves striking the road and wheels which did not lock and drag. It has been claimed that the restrictions in the earlier act were advocated by those with interests in the UK railway industry and horse-drawn carriages. In addition to any concerns about the state of the roads, by the 1860s, there was concern that the widespread use of traction engines, such as road locomotives and agricultural engines, would endanger the safety of the public. It was feared that engines and their trailers might cause fatal accidents, scare horses, block narrow lanes, and disturb the locals by operating at night. Although all of these fears were justified and were soon realized, there was a gradual acceptance of the machines as they became more common in commerce. Similar 'Red Flag' legislation was enacted in some states in the United States.e.g. The emerging UK automotive industry advocated very effectively for the 1896 Act during the preceding year. Coventry manufacturer Harry J. Lawson, who had purchased the British Daimler engine patents in 1895 and later was to form The Daimler Motor Company, was very influential. Economic historian Kenneth Richardson has suggested that the 1896 Act may have been written by Sir David Salomons, the founder of the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, on his assumption that no government department personnel would have had the necessary experience to do so themselves. The Acts Dormans engines ad referring to the Red Flag Act (1919) Locomotive Act 1861 :An Act for regulating the use of locomotives on turnpike and other roads, and the tolls to be levied on such locomotives and on the waggons and carriages drawn or propelled by the same. The Locomotives on Highways Act 1861 recognised that the use of \\"powered locomotives\\" on turnpikes and other roads would become commonplace, and that many existing laws (e.g. Turnpike, Highway acts) did not contain any provision for regulation or tolling of such vehicles.Locomotives Act 1861, pre-amble The act contained sections on: *Toll fees of locomotives and their wagons: to be tolled at every 2 tons of vehicle weight, and equal to the respective tolls charged for horse-drawn vehicles. Vehicles with non-cylindrical wheels were to be charged 50% more. (Section 1) *Regulations on the minimum width of wheels of vehicles over 3 tons: and on maximum loads per wheel, and restrictions on vehicles thought to be damaging to roads. (Sections 3, 4, 5) *Regulations, restrictions, and procedures for compensation to trustees on the passage of locomotives over bridges and other structures for any damage caused thereon. (Section 7) *Requirement for the vehicle to consume its own smoke (Section 8) *Requirement for a road locomotive to be manned by at least two persons, with additional persons in charge of trains of wagons, as well as requirements for the vehicle to carry functional lights during nighttime. (Section 9) *A speed limit of 10 mph on open roads, or 5 mph in inhabited areas. (Section 11) *Requirement for the owners name, and the weight of the vehicle to be clearly displayed on the vehicle. (Section 12) The act also set out the values of fines for breach of the regulations. (Red Flag Act) The Locomotive Act 1865 (Red Flag Act): *Stipulated that self-propelled vehicles should be accompanied by a crew of three; if the vehicle was attached to two or more vehicles an additional person was to accompany the vehicles; a man with a red flag was to walk at least ahead of each vehicle, who was also required to assist with the passage of horses and carriages. The vehicle was required to stop at the signal of the flagbearer. (Section 3) *Additionally vehicles were also required to have functional lights, and not sound whistles or blow off steam whilst on the road. (Section 3) *A speed limit of 4 mph (2 mph in towns) was imposed for road locomotives, with a fine of ¬£10 for contravention. (Section 4) *The restricted road locomotive vehicles to 14 tons, and 9 ft in width, as well as requiring the vehicle to have wheels meeting the requirements of the 1861 act. (Section 5) Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878 :An Act to amend the Law relating to Highways in England and the Acts relating to Locomotives on Roads; and for other purposes. The Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878 contained sections on: *Arrangements regarding the formation of 'highway districts'; stipulating that they should roughly correspond with rural sanitary districts, and allowing the sanitary authority to apply to manage the highway districts, taking over property, debts and liabilities relating to the highway. (Part I. 3-12) *De- turnpiked roads to become 'main roads' and half their maintenance cost paid through county rates. (Part I. 13) *Gave the highway authority powers to request that roads between towns, and roads to railway stations be classified as 'main roads' (Part I. 15) *Allow the county authority to contribute to maintenance of bridges (Part I. 21-22) *Provisions to recover maintenance costs from road users operating heavy traffic and causing excess road wear. (Part I. 23) *Set out procedures for the highway authority to discontinue any unneeded roads. (Part I. 24) *Allowing the repeal and issue of bylaws relating to animal drawn vehicles that might cause damage to the road; as well as regulations on gates and regulations on bicycles, and allowing the issue of fines relating to such byelaws. (Part I. 26) The act also repealed and replaced with amendments part of the 1861 and 1865 Locomotive Acts; these included: *Section 3 of the 1861 act and section 5 of the Locomotive Act 1865 - clauses relating to the weight, length, and width of tire of road locomotives (Part II. 28) *Section 8 of the 1861 act, requiring road locomotives to consume their own smoke was repealed and amended. (Part II. 30-31) Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 The Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 introduced a 12 mph speed limit (8 to 16 mph at the local authorities discretion), speed limits were later increased by the Motor Car Act 1903. Locomotives Act 1898 :An Act to amend the Law with respect to the use of Locomotives on Highways, and with respect to extraordinary Traffic. The 1898 Act required road users to affix signs displaying the weight of wagons; limited length of hauled road trains to three wagons without permission, and gave powers to road authorities to operate weighing machines for the weighing of road vehicles, as well as allowing fines for the contravention of the regulations, and allowed for compensation relating to delay caused by the weighing process. (Sections 2, 3 and 4 respectively) The act also contained sections on: *Regulations relating to number of persons in attendance to road locomotives, assistance to passing horses or carriages, and the requirement for and proper form of illuminating lights (Section 5) *Allowing councils to restrict the passage on road locomotives and their wagons on crowded highways, and bridges (in case of damage), whilst allowing bridge restrictions to be lifted on the payment of costs relating to bridge strengthening (Section 6) *Gave the right of appeal to road locomotives operators on restrictions under the act of the 1861 act. (Section 7) *Restricted passing of locomotives on bridges (Section 8) *Required road locomotives used for haulage (excluding agricultural machines, and steam rollers) to be licensed by the county council, and set out the requirement for display of a license plate (Sections 9, 10, 11) See also *Speed limit enforcement *United Kingdom enterprise law References=Acts  * * Category:Vehicle law Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1861 Category:1861 in transport Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1865 Category:1865 in transport Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1878 Category:1878 in transport Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1898 Category:1898 in transport Category:Steam road vehicles Category:Transport policy in the United Kingdom Category:Traffic law ","title":"Locomotive Acts"},{"id":"1490681","text":"Springville High School may refer to: *Springville High School (Alabama), Springville, Alabama *Springville High School (Iowa), Springville, Iowa *Springville High School (New York), Springville *Springville High School (Utah), Springville ","title":"Springville High School"},{"id":"1490684","text":"Lepra is a UK-based international charity working to beat leprosy. Since being founded in 1924 they have helped to diagnose, treat and rehabilitate people affected by leprosy. Lepra currently works in India, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Throughout Lepra's history, the reigning British monarch has always been Lepra's patron. King George VI became the first of the Royal family to sponsor children through their adoption scheme at the time but Queen Elizabeth II became Patron of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association (BELRA) in 1952 following his death. The Duke of Gloucester KG GCVO is the current Vice President of Lepra. Lepra is a member of the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP), a federation of international non-governmental organisations committed to creating a world free of leprosy and of The UK Coalition against Neglected Tropical Diseases, a collaborative partnership between UK organisations actively engaged in the implementation and research of neglected tropical disease control. Other partners of Lepra include Lepra India, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the World Health Organization, and the BIG Lottery Fund, as well as a range of corporate partners.  Founding Principles  Lepra was founded in 1924 on two principles that at the time set the organisation apart. Firstly, Lepra believed that leprosy was surrounded by superstition and myth, incorrectly leading to prejudice and isolation for those affected by leprosy. In contrast being ‚Äúevidence-led‚Äù was put at the centre of the organisation's policies and practice. Secondly, Lepra was established as a secular charity. Open to all faiths and beliefs and favouring none above another. These principles remain at the core of the organisation, 95 years on.  History  Lepra's history started in 1923, when Major General Sir Leonard Rogers, ex-Indian Medical Service, agreed to join Rev. Frank Oldrieve in forming a new association. Sir Leonard Rogers had been working on a treatment for leprosy based on chaulmoogra oil for several years and had recorded good results. On 12 July 1923, the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association (BELRA) was constituted at a meeting at the India Office presided over by Viscount Chelmsford.  Belra  On 31 January 1924, the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association was officially founded by Rogers and Oldrieve, with the financial help of Sir Frank Carter, a Calcutta businessman and philanthropist. BELRA was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at The Mansion House in London. The association boldly stated its aim as ‚Äúto rid the Empire of leprosy.‚Äù It was set up as a medical organisation, spearheading outpatient work instead of the traditional method of (compulsory) segregation. From his experience, it was clear to Rogers that it was important to treat leprosy in its earliest stages, and that the segregation system caused people to hide the illness for as long as possible. King Edward VI became the first Patron.  Significant Moments in Lepra's History and Contributions to the Fight Against Leprosy  1928 ‚Äì A pamphlet entitled ‚ÄòLeprosy Notes‚Äô is begun to share information on the disease. 1929 ‚Äì Dr Robert Cochrane took over from Oldrieve and began his long association with BELRA by becoming its Medical and General Secretary. 1930 ‚Äì ‚ÄòLeprosy Notes‚Äô becomes ‚ÄòLeprosy Review‚Äô a more scientific journal to encourage and disseminate the use of evidence led work with people affected by leprosy. 1931 ‚Äì At the International Leprosy Congress in Manila, BELRA is recognised as the ‚ÄòFirst leprosy prevention organisation‚Äô. 1935 ‚Äì A Child Adoption Scheme is launched as a method of raising funds for treatment of children as inpatients of leprosy hospitals. Child patients are connected with a particular UK sponsor. 1945 ‚Äì BELRA is one of the first organisations to methodically trial Dapsone as a treatment for Leprosy and record its impact. 1947 ‚Äì The Royal family adopt children through BELRA's Child Adoption Scheme. 1948 ‚Äì Dapsone is announced as a cheap and effective cure for leprosy. Dapsone is still used as part of multi-drug therapy for leprosy. 1951 ‚Äì In 1951 Dr Robert Cochrane becomes Leprosy Adviser to the UK Ministry of Health. 1952 ‚Äì The Queen becomes patron of BELRA. 1953 ‚Äì BELRA establishes the first leprosy research centre in Eastern Africa. The site for the East African Leprosy Research Centre was chosen to be within the grounds of the Itesio Leprosarium in Kenya. In 1959 the name of the centre was changed to Alupe. The Centre is now known as The Centre for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases Control Research (CIPDCR) and is one of the 12 centres of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). 1956 ‚Äì The Queen visited the Oji River Leprosy Settlement in Nigeria, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. 1957 ‚Äì At the Annual General Meeting, following the decolonisation process of the British Empire, the Association changes its name to the British Leprosy Relief Association, retaining the abbreviation BELRA. 1959 ‚Äì At Ongino Leprosarium, in Uganda, the first made-to-fit shoe is tried out to take the pressure off ulcerated feet. Providing people affected by leprosy and LF with protective footwear is one of the key activities of Lepra to this day. 1961 ‚Äì BELRA is instrumental in the development of Clofazimine (B663), which to this day remains a part of the multid drug therapy used for multi bacillary leprosy. 1962 ‚Äì A mobile exhibition van starts touring the UK, promoting BELRA's work.  LEPRA  1964 ‚Äì The Association changes its short title from BELRA to LEPRA. 1965 ‚Äì The High Commissioner for Malawi and LEPRA's President, Viscount Boyd, approved an agreement on the Malawi Pilot Leprosy Control project, which then begins work. 1974 ‚Äì LEPRA moves its headquarters from London to Colchester, where its offices are still based today.  Other Achievements from 1975 Onwards  1975 ‚Äì As a result of research, LEPRA becomes one of the first associations to use multidrug therapy for treating leprosy, to increase effectiveness and minimise drug resistance. 1976 ‚Äì LEPRA becomes a full member of the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP). 1984 ‚Äì LEPRA's diamond jubilee is celebrated with a service of thanksgiving at All Hallows by the Tower church, London. It is attended by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie. 1990 ‚Äì LEPRA starts its BOLEP project in Sonepur, Odisha, India, which had the highest prevalence of leprosy in the world at the time. The project continues to this day. 1992 ‚Äì LEPRA funds research into a new surgical technique to restore sense of touch and temperature to damaged feet and hands, in cooperation with the Royal College of Surgeons in London and a leprosy centre in India. 1996 ‚Äì Lepra is chosen to be the partner charity for the BBC Children's Television Blue Peter Appeal. The appeal raises more than ¬£2.8 million. 1998 ‚Äì LEPRA extends its work by applying its expertise and skills to helping people with tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. 1998 ‚Äì LEPRA receives a National Lottery Charities Board award. 1998 ‚Äì LEPRA achieves ‚ÄúInvestors in People‚Äù status. 1999 ‚Äì The ‚ÄòQuest for Dignity‚Äô competition is held asking young artists to portray the leprosy theme in either picture or sculpture form. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend the award ceremony at the Royal Geographic Society. Neelima Reddy received her award from the Queen as the winner of the picture competition. 1999 ‚ÄìThe Blue Peter Health Research Centre is officially inaugurated in Hyderabad, India in December. 2000 ‚Äì The first mass drug administration for Lymphatic Filariasis took place. 2000 ‚Äì LEPRA introduces health education vans in India, taking health education into communities. 2000 ‚Äì At the request of the government of Bangladesh, LEPRA takes over the responsibility for leprosy control work in Sirajganj and Pabna districts. 2000 ‚Äì In an extraordinary spirit of international co-operation, LEPRA joins together with the World Health Organisation, ILEP, governments of major endemic countries and other major organisations in the Global Alliance against leprosy. 2003 ‚Äì LEPRA's International contribution to the fight against leprosy is recognised at the Third Meeting of the Global Alliance for the Elimination of Leprosy (GAEL) in Yangon, Myanmar. 2004 ‚Äì Leprosy Review, is cited as one of the top five tropical medicine journals as referenced by the Institute of Scientific Information. 2006 ‚Äì Lepra establishes the system of \\"health camps\\" in Bangladesh to test for TB. 2011 ‚Äì A new study from the Blue Peter Health Research Centre identifies new biomarkers to detect TB early in HIV-positive people. 2012 ‚Äì LEPRA begins self-support groups for those affected by LF and leprosy. 2013 ‚Äì LEPRA is re-branded with the speech bubble, and a lower case name, Lepra. 2014 ‚Äì A private dinner in the State Apartments at Kensington Palace is held to celebrate Lepra's 90th Anniversary. 2016 ‚Äì The Patron's Lunch is held in The Mall ‚Äì Lepra is one of the charities invited to take part. 2017 ‚Äì Lepra's Museum is officially opened by Kate Anderson, Gt. Niece of Sir Frank Carter, one of Lepra's founding members. 2017 - Lepra publishes an article in Leprosy Review showing the need for a return to an active case finding strategy in endemic countries to reduce the numbers of people affected by leprosy.  Lepra  In 2013, LEPRA was re-branded as Lepra and in 2014 celebrated its 90th birthday. This was celebrated with a special anniversary edition of its quarterly magazine Lepra News, including a timeline of many of Lepra's achievements over the years.  LEPRA India  LEPRA Society is a partner of Lepra, serving the needs of people affected by leprosy across India. While its history dates back to 1925, when Lepra started working in India, it was established as an independent Indian NGO in Hyderabad in 1988 to comply with Indian law. Lepra and Lepra Society remain closely linked through governance and institutional structures and are a single consolidated charitable entity. On 3 August 1989, LEPRA Society of India held its inaugural meeting in Hyderabad.  Where Lepra works  Lepra is an international charity and, as of 2019, works in India, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Lepra's international office is based in Colchester, England. Over the years, Lepra has worked in countries around the world, including India, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Uganda, Kenya, Zanzibar, and Malawi.  India  India carries at least 60% of the global leprosy burden. It is estimated that two million people are living with long-term effects of the disease. Additionally, people with leprosy still experience prejudice in India and there are several laws that discriminate against them. Lepra, through Lepra Society, works in seven Indian States, namely Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi. Lepra's projects in India, include comprehensive referral centres where self-supporting groups in rural areas, across health education, bespoke footwear for disability, active case finding, livelihood support, reaction treatment and support, mental health counselling, health education, reconstructive surgery and training. Hyperbad in Telangana is home to the Blue Peter Public Health Centre, which combines high quality research with clinical practice.  Bangladesh  Bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world. Additionally, it is prone to natural disasters, such as annual flooding. Mosquitos, carrying diseases, breed in the wet and flooded areas. As a result of this and the high population density, half the population of Bangladesh is at risk of lymphatic filariasis. Bangladesh is poorly equipped to deal with these health problems as there is a serious shortage of health workers. A 2011 estimate shows there are only 3 doctors and 1 nurse per 10,000 people in Bangladesh. Most of these health workers are concentrated in urban areas, while most of the population lives in rural areas. Lepra currently works in 11 districts in the north of Bangladesh, including Bogra, Sirajganj, Pabna and Natore.  Mozambique  In Mozambique, Lepra is working in partnership with the Netherlands Leprosy Relief (NLR) in the Zambezia province. Zambezia is the second most populous province in the country. In 2014, an NLR team visited Zambezia and noted that the government of Mozambique was facing challenges implementing the national health policy on neglected tropical diseases. It was also found that self-help groups which had been facilitated by Lepra until 2010 had not continued without external support. In collaboration with NLR, Lepra is focusing on building the capacity of staff as well as strengthening the control programmes for NTDs. The aim of these projects is to find cases of leprosy and LF before disability sets in, as well as helping those who already have a disability to reintegrate into work and society. This work in Mozambique combines NLR's experience in the provinces of Nampula and Niassa and Lepra's experience in Bangladesh and India.  What Lepra does  Lepra takes an integrated approach to reducing the incidence and impact of leprosy, lymphatic filariasis. Lepra tackles the diseases, but also aims to enable people to improve their livelihoods and overcome disability, discrimination and prejudice. The following are some of the many ways in which Lepra helps people fight disease, poverty and prejudice.  Diagnosing and treating leprosy  One of Lepra's core activities is the diagnosis and treatment of leprosy. When a doctor, health worker or health volunteer suspects someone has leprosy, Lepra will test skin sensations to determine whether the person can feel their skin being touched with cotton wool, feather or a ballpoint. Another way to determine leprosy infection is by taking a skin smear from a nodule on the skin. The skin smear is only positive, however, if many leprosy bacilli are present, meaning that the patient is heavily infected. Leprosy is treated by multidrug therapy (MDT), a combination of Dapsone and Rifampicin for six months in the case of low infection - \\"Paucibillary\\". For higher infection levels, \\"multi-bacillary\\", Clofazimine is added to the MDT and the treatment period is lengthened to 12 months.  Early diagnoses and active case finding  Lepra also recognises the importance of early detection of leprosy. Delayed diagnosis can cause life changing disabilities due to nerve damage from the disease. Late detection also increases the likelihood of leprosy spreading through the community. Lepra's active case finding method involves a screening of people around an infected person. While previous methods focused specifically on people sharing a household with a person affected by leprosy, Lepra focuses on both household members and 20-25 households around an index-case and conducts systematic screening of communities, schools or other places where endemicity is thought to be high.  Lymphatic filariasis  Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease contracted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It causes swelling of body parts and altering of the immune system. As a result, LF can lead to severe deformities, debilitating fever and damage to the lymphatic system. Walking can become very difficult and painful, and swollen feet are vulnerable to injury. This can make it impossible for a person with LF to work for several days, pushing them into poverty. Stigma surrounding the disease also means people with LF can be shunned and isolated from their family and community. Although there is no cure for LF, Lepra implements a number of strategies to make the disease manageable for those affected. They travel to remote communities to teach self-care techniques to reduce swelling and pain. If feet are already severely deformed, Lepra provides people with custom-made protective footwear.  Health education and health worker training  In many of the places where Lepra works, basic health information is often lacking, both for the general public and for health workers. Lepra tries to remedy this by providing health education and health training. Health education vans are used by Lepra to bring health messages to people living in the most remote and most rural areas. These vans visit villages to educate people about maintaining good health and informing them about the symptoms of leprosy, LF and other prevalent diseases. Lepra also undertakes health education in schools, teaching children the symptoms of leprosy so they can recognise the disease not only in themselves, but also in their families. School visits are also an important step in dispelling leprosy myths and the stigma surrounding the disease. Lepra works with governments to improve health worker training, providing them with knowledge of neglected diseases and making them more accepting of people affected by them. Lepra also trains traditional doctors to recognise the symptoms of leprosy and other neglected diseases, so they can refer patients to government facilities where they will receive correct treatment. To fill in the gaps in the health service, Lepra also works with community health volunteers who are trained to recognise symptoms and work in their own communities to spread health messages, follow up on cases, and refer suspected cases of illness to the correct health facilities.  Advocacy and fighting prejudice  People with leprosy or other diseases such as lymphatic filariasis don't just face physical challenges ‚Äì they often also have to deal with stigma and prejudice from their communities, the government, or even their families. People may have their children taken away, suffer physical or psychological abuse, or are shunned or even exiled. Such stigma often remains long after a person has been cured. This can lead to social isolation, depression, and even suicide. Studies show that 50% of people with leprosy will face depression and anxiety. Many people who have leprosy or used to have leprosy are forced to live in leprosy colonies across India and Bangladesh, isolated from their families and communities. Social stigma is a consequence of ignorance and the existence of many myths and misconceptions about leprosy, its causes and the existence of a cure. Lepra aims to fight prejudice and stigma by providing health education to the general population, as well as health worker training. They also provide support to people who face leprosy and other diseases, such as counselling services at the Munger Referral Centre. Beside discrimination from their communities, people with leprosy and disabilities in India still face several laws that discriminate against them in terms of employment, marriage, and other areas. As a result, people showing symptoms or effects of the disease are unable to work and/or are denied government benefits, meaning they have to beg for money in order to survive and support their families. Lepra is actively working with national and state networks of people affected by leprosy and disability across India and Bangladesh to fight such discrimination. They help them advocate for and claim their own rights, such as their rights to land as well as disability and old age benefits, but also teach them about their basic human rights, and find opportunities for them to directly meet with government representatives and local authorities.  Self- help groups  Diseases and disability are both causes and consequences of poverty. In combination with prejudice and discrimination, many people with leprosy and disability lose their jobs, meaning they often have to beg for money in order to support themselves and their families. Increased health care costs can also push families deeper into poverty. To help people improve their livelihoods and climb out of poverty, Lepra has set up several self-help groups across India, Bangladesh and Mozambique. These groups advise people on how to best help themselves with health care and income generation. At each meeting, members of the self-help groups make a small financial contribution to a group fund. This fund is then used to provide members with an interest- free business loan to finance business initiatives such as a local shop, goat rearing, or tailoring. Members of the group are also trained in group management skills, self-care, or advocacy skills, as well as given the knowledge and skills needed to work themselves out of poverty.  Community disability care and protective footwear  Lepra teaches people how to care for their disabilities, so they are not left unable to work, and also provides people with protective footwear so they can get around more easily. Lepra organises self-care camps in local communities where people can learn how to care for their disabilities through cleaning and physiotherapy techniques that they can then do at home. People with disabilities are invited to demonstrate to others how they can prevent infection and reduce the severity of their disabilities. One simple solution is washing and soaking wounds on a daily basis. Organising these self-care camps in communities means people gain a better understanding of the symptoms and treatment of disease and disability, reducing prejudice and stigma. Lepra also provides basic self-care kits to people free of charge. These kits include a bar of soap, anti-bacterial ointment, cream to prevent fungal infections, and a towel. Due to nerve damage, people with leprosy are vulnerable to injuries, potentially leading to severe damage to fingers, toes, hands and feet. LF can cause severe swelling in the feet and legs, making it difficult to walk as well. Lepra provides people with leprosy and LF with specialist, made-to-fit shoes, carefully designed for each individual. Shoes provide comfort, encourage healing of wounds and ulcers, and prevent further injury and disability. But a pair of shoes can also contribute to restoring a person's dignity and removing stigma within the community. Several shoe technicians are working in clinics and referral centres, while Lepra also has a few shoe vans driving across India providing the service to local communities. Making one pair of shoes only takes one hour and they come in many different designs.  Referral centres  Lepra started setting up referral centres when people with leprosy were not ‚Äòallowed‚Äô into hospitals or did not receive proper treatment due to stigma and doctors not specialising in the disease. Now, Lepra's referral centres provide services in areas where health facilities are lacking or unable to manage neglected diseases like leprosy or LF, and the disabilities they can cause. The services offered at these referral centres include testing, treatment, disability care, physiotherapy, ulcer care, reconstructive surgery and counselling to people affected by diseases as well as their families. Many of these centres also have their own shoe technician available, manufacturing and supplying protective shoes to people with disabilities. Lepra runs their referral centres in partnership with state and national health systems. They are often located in government health centres and hospitals. Ultimately, the aim is to hand them over to governments to ensure their sustainability.  Research and innovation  Lepra is one of the world's leading authorities on leprosy. Over the years, Lepra has conducted pioneering research in the treatment of leprosy and has been at the forefront of developing a cure and trialling a multitude of drug treatments. Today research still forms an important part of Lepra's work, carrying out both scientific and field research to further knowledge of neglected diseases and the effects they have on poor communities. Recent research has focused on active case finding, disability aids, diagnostic tools and the mental health needs of those affected by leprosy.  Blue Peter Health Research Centre  In 1996, Lepra was chosen to be the partner charity for the BBC Children's Television programme Blue Peter in their ‚ÄòBring and Buy Sale‚Äô for leprosy. The appeal raised more than ¬£2.8 million. In December 1999, the Blue Peter Health Research Centre is officially inaugurated in Hyderabad, India. To this day, the Centre remains an excellent training and treatment facility for those with leprosy. It offers a unique combination of high-quality research and clinical practice. Lepra also conducts research into the impact of diseases on the economic and social well-being of those affected, allowing the organisation to design projects responding to community needs in more effective ways.  Leprosy Review  Each quarter, Lepra publishes Leprosy Review, an English- language scientific journal on leprosy. The open-access academic journal includes original papers on all aspects of leprosy, from research into medical, physical and social aspects of leprosy to information relevant to leprosy control. A forerunner of Leprosy Review, named Leprosy Notes, was first published in 1928. In its first issue, Rev. Frank Oldrieve, as Secretary of the Association, writes that the hope is ‚Äúthat leprosy workers in the British Empire will find these notes of service.‚Äù He also invites readers to write in with any notes ‚Äúon the results obtained from the various treatments that are being tried.‚Äù In total, seven issues of Leprosy Notes are published across two years. In 1930, the first issue of Leprosy Review is published, a larger and expanded version of Leprosy Notes, with Dr Robert Cochrane as its first editor. Its aim was to ‚Äúmeet the need for a quarterly periodical giving interesting and practical details to workers, especially to those who have made no attempt to specialise exclusively in the field of leprosy.‚Äù In 2004, Leprosy Review was cited as one of the top five medicine journals by the Institute of Scientific Information. The Leprosy Notes of 1928 and 1929 as well as all Leprosy Review issues from 1930 to 2001 were made freely available online thanks to the Full Text Leprosy Project, an initiative of the Lauro de Souza Lima Institute of Secretary of Health of S√£o Paulo, in cooperation with the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information and The International Journal of Leprosy. Issues from 2002 onwards are available on Lepra's website.  Vision and values  Lepra's vision is to be a leader in reducing the incidence and impact of leprosy and other neglected diseases, and enabling children, women and men affected by leprosy, lymphatic filariasis (LF), to transform their lives and overcome the prejudice which surrounds these two diseases. Lepra is committed to five values that guide their work. They strive to be: * People centred * Transparent and accountable * Innovative and demonstrating bold leadership * Effective and efficient * Collaborative  Lepra's Ambassadors  Lepra currently has four ambassadors who help to support and promote their work:  Fiona Duby  Fiona Duby has more than 40 years‚Äô experience of working in 29 countries in Africa and Asia in health and development programmes in both the public and the private sector. She was awarded an MBE for services to Bangladesh in 1992 and an OBE for services to Nigeria in 1999. She saw the effects of leprosy on people's lives amongst the poorest while travelling through Africa. In 2000, she was invited to join Lepra's Board of Trustees and after 15 years welcomed the opportunity to become an Ambassador. She hopes to use her experience to help raise awareness.  Victoria Hislop  Victoria Hislop is an author best known for her best- selling novel The Island, which tells the story of one family's history with the island of Spinalonga ‚Äì Greece's former leper colony. Victoria became Ambassador for Lepra in 2013 and has been to India to visit Lepra's projects. She has shared her own experience of seeing Lepra's care to the whole person in an integrated, practical and dignified way and has stated that one of Lepra's strengths is its strong relationships with local health networks.  Stuart Miles  Stuart Miles was one of the Blue Peter presenters at the time when Lepra was selected as the charity for Blue Peter's annual fundraiser in 1996. Stuart has since visited projects, helping to raise awareness of leprosy and Lepra's appeals.  Stuart Paver  Stuart Paver is the managing director of Pavers; the shoe company has helped to fund the Lepra shoe vans in India that produce custom-made protective footwear for people with disabilities. The footwear enables people to walk without fear of injury, regaining their confidence to return to work. In 2018 Stuart became a Lepra ambassador and continues to raise awareness of leprosy References External links  * Category:Leprosy organizations Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Foreign charities operating in Bangladesh Category:Charities based in Essex Category:Foreign charities operating in India Category:Foreign charities operating in Malawi ","title":"Lepra"},{"id":"1490692","text":"A dysfunctional family is a family in which conflict, misbehavior, and often child neglect or abuse on the part of individual parents occur continuously and regularly, leading other members to accommodate such actions. Children sometimes grow up in such families with the understanding that such a situation is normal. Dysfunctional families are primarily a result of two adults, one typically overtly abusive and the other codependent, and may also be affected by addictions (such as substance abuse, such drugs including alcohol), or sometimes by an untreated mental illness. Dysfunctional parents may emulate or over-correct from their own dysfunctional parents. In some cases, the dominant parent will abuse or neglect their children and the other parent will not object, misleading a child to assume blame. Perceptions and historical context A common misperception of dysfunctional families is the mistaken belief that the parents are on the verge of separation and divorce. While this is true in a few cases, often the marriage bond is very strong as the parents' faults actually complement each other. In short, they have nowhere else to go. However, this does not necessarily mean the family's situation is stable. Any major stressor, such as relocation, unemployment/underemployment, physical or mental illness, natural disaster, etc., can cause existing conflicts affecting the children to become much worse. Dysfunctional families pervade all strata of society regardless of social, financial or intellectual status. Nevertheless, until recent decades, the concept of a dysfunctional family was not taken seriously by professionals (therapists, social workers, teachers, counselors, clergy, etc.), especially among the middle and upper classes. Any intervention would have been seen as violating the sanctity of marriage and increasing the probability of divorce, which was socially unacceptable at the time. Historically, children of dysfunctional families were expected to obey their parents (ultimately the father), and cope with the situation alone. Examples Dysfunctional family members have common features and behavior patterns as a result of their experiences within the family structure. This tends to reinforce the dysfunctional behavior, either through enabling or perpetuation. The family unit can be affected by a variety of factors. Common featuresNear universal= Some features are common to most dysfunctional families: * Lack of empathy, understanding, and sensitivity towards certain family members, while expressing extreme empathy or appeasement towards one or more members who have real or perceived \\"special needs\\". In other words, one family member continuously receives far more than they deserve, while another is marginalized. * Denial (refusal to acknowledge abusive behavior, possibly believing that the situation is normal or even beneficial; also known as the \\"elephant in the room\\".) * Inadequate or missing boundaries for self (e.g. tolerating inappropriate treatment from others, failing to express what is acceptable and unacceptable treatment, tolerance of physical, emotional or sexual abuse.) * Disrespect of others' boundaries (e.g. physical contact that other person dislikes; breaking important promises without just cause; purposefully violating a boundary another person has expressed.) * Extremes in conflict (either too much fighting or insufficient peaceful arguing between family members.) * Unequal or unfair treatment of one or more family members due to their birth order, gender, age, family role (mother, etc.), abilities, race, caste, etc. (may include frequent appeasement of one member at the expense of others, or an uneven/inconsistent enforcement of rules.) =Not universal= Though not universal among dysfunctional families, and by no means exclusive to them, the following features are typical of dysfunctional families: * Abnormally high levels of jealousy or other controlling behaviors. * Conflict influenced by marital status: ** Between separated or divorced parents, usually related to, or arising from their breakup. ** Conflict between parents who remain married, often for the perceived \\"sake\\" of the children, but whose separation or divorce would in fact remove a detrimental influence on those children (must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as a breakup may harm children.) ** Parents who wish to divorce, but cannot due to financial, societal (including religious), or legal reasons. * Children afraid to talk (within or outside the family) about what is happening at home, or are otherwise fearful of their parents. * Abnormal sexual behavior such as adultery, promiscuity, or incest. * Lack of time spent together, especially in recreational activities and social events (\\"We never do anything as a family.\\") * Parents insist that they treat their children fairly and equitably when that is not the case. * Family members (including children) who disown each other, or refuse to be seen together in public (either unilaterally or bilaterally.) Specific examples In many cases, the following would cause a family to be dysfunctional: * Families with older parents or immigrant parents who cannot cope with changing times or a different culture. * A parent of the same sex never intercedes in father‚Äìdaughter/mother‚Äìson relations on behalf of the child. * Children who have no contact with the extended family of their mother or father due to disharmony, disagreement, prejudice, feuding, etc. * A family with one or more rebellious children at whom parents are chronically angry, wherein non-rebellious children have to \\"walk on eggshells\\" to avoid spillover effects of the parents' anger. * An intense rift, extending beyond mere disagreement of opinion to personal animosity between family members regarding ideology (e.g. children's disagreement with their parents' religious beliefs; a family member having an abortion while other members sharply object; parents who support their country being at war, while children do not.) Laundry List The Laundry List is core literature of the program Adult Children of Alcoholics. It comprises 14 common traits of an adult child of an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family: # We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process. # We are frightened by angry people and any personal criticism. # We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs. # We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships. # We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc. # We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others. # We became addicted to excitement. # We confuse love and pity and tend to \\"love\\" people we can \\"pity\\" and \\"rescue.\\" # We have \\"stuffed\\" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (denial). # We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem. # We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us. # Alcoholism is a family disease, and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink. # Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors. Parenting=Unhealthy signs Unhealthy parenting signs, which could lead to a family becoming dysfunctional include: * Unrealistic expectations * Ridicule * Conditional love * Disrespect; especially contempt. * Emotional intolerance (family members not allowed to express the \\"wrong\\" emotions.) * Social dysfunction or isolation (for example, parents unwilling to reach out to other families‚Äîespecially those with children of the same gender and approximate age, or do nothing to help their \\"friendless\\" child.) * Stifled speech (children not allowed to dissent or question authority.) * Denial of an \\"inner life\\" (children are not allowed to develop their own value systems.) * Being under- or over-protective * Apathy (\\"I don't care!\\") * Belittling (\\"You can't do anything right!\\") * Shame (\\"Shame on you!\\") * Bitterness (regardless of what is said, using a bitter tone of voice.) * Hypocrisy (\\"Do as I say, not as I do.\\") * Lack of forgiveness for minor misdeeds or accidents * Judgmental statements or demonization (\\"You are a liar!\\") * Either little or excessive criticism (experts say 80‚Äì90% praise, and 10‚Äì20% constructive criticism is the most healthy.) * Double standards or giving \\"mixed messages\\" by having a dual system of values (i.e. one set for the outside world, another when in private, or teaching divergent values to each child.) * The absentee parent (seldom available for their child due to work overload, alcohol/drug abuse, gambling, or other addictions.) * Unfulfilled projects, activities, and promises affecting children (\\"We'll do it later.\\") * Giving to one child what rightly belongs to another * Gender prejudice (treats one gender of children fairly; the other unfairly.) * Discussion and exposure to sexuality: either too much, too soon or too little, too late * Faulty discipline based more on emotions or family politics than on established rules (e.g., punishment by \\"surprise\\".) * Having an unpredictable emotional state due to substance abuse, personality disorder(s), or stress * Parents always (or never) take their children's side when others report acts of misbehavior, or teachers report problems at school * Scapegoating (knowingly or recklessly blaming one child for the misdeeds of another) * \\"Tunnel vision\\" diagnosis of children's problems (for example, a parent may think their child is either lazy or has learning disabilities after he falls behind in school despite recent absence due to illness.) * Older siblings given either no or excessive authority over younger siblings with respect to their age difference and level of maturity. * Frequent withholding of consent (\\"blessing\\") for culturally common, lawful, and age-appropriate activities a child wants to take part in * The \\"know-it-all\\" (has no need to obtain child's side of the story when accusing, or listen to child's opinions on matters which greatly impact them.) * Regularly forcing children to attend activities for which they are extremely over- or under-qualified (e.g. using a preschool to babysit a typical nine-year-old boy, taking a young child to poker games, etc.) * Either being a miser (\\"scrooge\\") in totality or selectively allowing children's needs to go unmet (e.g. a father will not buy a bicycle for his son because he wants to save money for retirement or \\"something important\\".) * Disagreements about nature and nurture (parents, often non-biological, blame common problems on child's heredity, when faulty parenting may be the actual cause.) Dysfunctional styles\\"Children as pawns\\"= One common dysfunctional parental behavior is a parent's manipulation of a child in order to achieve some outcome adverse to the other parent's rights or interests. Examples include verbal manipulation such as spreading gossip about the other parent, communicating with the parent through the child (and in the process exposing the child to the risks of the other parent's displeasure with that communication) rather than doing so directly, trying to obtain information through the child (spying), or causing the child to dislike the other parent, with insufficient or no concern for the damaging effects of the parent's behavior on the child. While many instances of such manipulation occur in shared custody situations that have resulted from separation or divorce, it can also take place in intact families, where it is known as triangulation. =List of other dysfunctional styles= * \\"Using\\" (destructively narcissistic parents who rule by fear and conditional love.) * Abusing (parents who use physical violence, or emotionally, or sexually abuse their children.) * Perfectionist (fixating on order, prestige, power, or perfect appearances, while preventing their child from failing at anything.) * Dogmatic or cult-like (harsh and inflexible discipline, with children not allowed, within reason, to dissent, question authority, or develop their own value system.) * Inequitable parenting (going to extremes for one child while continually ignoring the needs of another.) * Deprivation (control or neglect by withholding love, support, necessities, sympathy, praise, attention, encouragement, supervision, or otherwise putting their children's well-being at risk.) * Abuse among siblings (parents fail to intervene when a sibling physically or sexually abuses another sibling.) * Abandonment (a parent who willfully separates from their children, not wishing any further contact, and in some cases without locating alternative, long-term parenting arrangements, leaving them as orphans.) * Appeasement (parents who reward bad behavior‚Äîeven by their own standards‚Äîand inevitably punish another child's good behavior in order to maintain the peace and avoid temper tantrums. \\"Peace at any price.\\") * Loyalty manipulation (giving unearned rewards and lavish attention trying to ensure a favored, yet rebellious child will be the one most loyal and well- behaved, while subtly ignoring the wants and needs of their most loyal child currently.) * \\"Helicopter parenting\\" (parents who micro-manage their children's lives or relationships among siblings‚Äîespecially minor conflicts.) * \\"The deceivers\\" (well-regarded parents in the community, likely to be involved in some charitable/non-profit works, who abuse or mistreat one or more of their children.) * \\"Public image manager\\" (sometimes related to above, children warned to not disclose what fights, abuse, or damage happens at home, or face severe punishment \\"Don't tell anyone what goes on in this family\\".) * \\"The paranoid parent\\" (a parent having persistent and irrational fear accompanied by anger and false accusations that their child is up to no good or others are plotting harm.) * \\"No friends allowed\\" (parents discourage, prohibit, or interfere with their child from making friends of the same age and gender.) * Role reversal (parents who expect their minor children to take care of them instead.) * \\"Not your business\\" (children continuously told that a particular brother or sister who is often causing problems is none of their concern.) * Ultra-egalitarianism (either a much younger child is permitted to do whatever an older child may, or an older child must wait years until a younger child is mature enough.) * \\"The guard dog\\" (a parent who blindly attacks family members perceived as causing the slightest upset to their esteemed spouse, partner, or child.) * \\"My baby forever\\" (a parent who will not allow one or more of their young children to grow up and begin taking care of themselves.) * \\"The cheerleader\\" (one parent \\"cheers on\\" the other parent who is simultaneously abusing their child.) * \\"Along for the ride\\" (a reluctant de facto, step, foster, or adoptive parent who does not truly care about their non-biological child, but must co-exist in the same home for the sake of their spouse or partner) See also: Cinderella effect. * \\"The politician\\" (a parent who repeatedly makes or agrees to children's promises while having little to no intention of keeping them.) * \\"It's taboo\\" (parents rebuff any questions children may have about sexuality, pregnancy, romance, puberty, certain areas of human anatomy, nudity, etc.) * Identified patient (one child, usually selected by the mother, who is forced into going to therapy while the family's overall dysfunction is kept hidden.) * M√ºnchausen syndrome by proxy (a much more extreme situation than above, where the child is intentionally made ill by a parent seeking attention from physicians and other professionals.) Dynamical Coalitions are subsystems within families with more rigid boundaries and are thought to be a sign of family dysfunction.Whiteman, Shawn D.; McHale, Susan M.; Soli, Anna.\\"Theoretical Perspectives on Sibling Relationships\\", J Fam Theory Rev., 2012 Jun 1; Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 124‚Äì139, . * The isolated family member (either a parent or child up against the rest of the otherwise united family.) * Parent vs. parent (frequent fights amongst adults, whether married, divorced, or separated, conducted away from the children.) * The polarized family (a parent and one or more children on each side of the conflict.) * Parents vs. kids (intergenerational conflict, generation gap or culture shock dysfunction.) * The balkanized family (named after the three-way war in the Balkans where alliances shift back and forth.) * Free-for-all (a family that fights in a \\"free-for-all\\" style, though may become polarized when range of possible choices is limited.) Children Unlike divorce, and to a lesser extent, separation, there is often no record of an \\"intact\\" family being dysfunctional. As a result, friends, relatives, and teachers of such children may be completely unaware of the situation. In addition, a child may be unfairly blamed for the family's dysfunction, and placed under even greater stress than those whose parents separate. The six basic roles Children growing up in a dysfunctional family have been known to adopt or be assigned one or more of the following six basic roles: * The Golden Child (also known as the Hero or SuperkidPolson and Newton, pp. 81‚Äì84): a child who becomes a high achiever or overachiever outside the family (e.g., in academics or athletics) as a means of escaping the dysfunctional family environment, defining themselves independently of their role in the dysfunctional family, currying favor with parents, or shielding themselves from criticism by family members. * The Problem Child, Rebel, or Truth Teller [Polson and Newton, pp. 84‚Äì85] (also known as the Scapegoat when unjustifiedly assigned this role by others within the family): the child who a) causes most problems related to the family's dysfunction or b) \\"acts out\\" in response to preexisting family dysfunction, in the latter case often in an attempt to divert attention paid to another member who exhibits a pattern of similar misbehavior. ** A variant of the \\"problem child\\" role is the Scapegoat, who is unjustifiably assigned the \\"problem child\\" role by others within the family or even wrongfully blamed by other family members for those members' own individual or collective dysfunction, often despite being the only emotionally stable member of the family. * The Caretaker: the one who takes responsibility for the emotional well-being of the family, often assuming a parental role; the intra-familial counterpart of the \\"Good Child\\"/\\"Superkid.\\" * The Lost Child or Passive Kid:Polson and Newton, pp. 86‚Äì90 the inconspicuous, introverted, quiet one, whose needs are usually ignored or hidden. * The Mascot or Family Clown:Polson and Newton, pp. 85‚Äì86 uses comedy to divert attention away from the increasingly dysfunctional family system. * The Mastermind: the opportunist who capitalizes on the other family members' faults to get whatever they want; often the object of appeasement by grown-ups.

Except where individually noted * Lack the ability to be playful, or childlike, and may \\"grow up too fast\\"; conversely they may grow up too slowly, or be in a mixed mode (e.g. well-behaved, but unable to care for themselves.) * Have moderate to severe mental health issues, including possible depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. * Become addicted to drugs, including cigarettes or alcohol, especially if parents or friends have done the same. * Developing behavioral addictions to such things like gambling, excessive spending, video games, pornography, or food; the latter often resulting in obesity or/and other physical health issues. * Bully or harass others, or be an easy victim thereof (possibly taking a dual role in different settings.) * Be in denial regarding the severity of the family's situation. * Have mixed feelings of love‚Äìhate towards certain family members. * Become a sex offender, possibly including pedophilia. * Have difficulty forming healthy relationships within their peer group (usually due to shyness or a personality disorder.) * Spend an inordinate amount of time alone watching television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, listening to music, going out for late night drives alone, and engaging in other activities which lack in-person social interaction. * Feel angry, anxious, depressed, isolated from others, or unlovable. * Have a speech disorder (related to emotional abuse.) * Distrust others or even have paranoia. * Become a juvenile delinquent and turn to a life of crime (with or without dropping out of school), and possibly become a gang member as well. * Struggle academically at school or academic performance declines unexpectedly. * Have low self-esteem or a poor self image with difficulty expressing emotions. * Do not pay close attention to their own physical or mental health * May be at risk of self-harm or suicide. * Exhibits lack of organization in their day to day lives. * Rebel against parental authority, or conversely, uphold their family's values in the face of peer pressure, or even try to take an impossible \\"middle ground\\" that pleases no one. * Turning the tables by abusing their abusive elderly parents, upon the former reaching adulthood. * Think only of themselves to make up the difference of their childhoods (as they are still learning the balance of self-love.) * Have little self-discipline when parents are not around, such as compulsive spending, procrastinating too close to deadlines, etc. (unfamiliar, inchoate, and seemingly lax or avoidable real-world consequences vs. known, concrete, and rigidly imposed parental consequences.) * Find an (often abusive) spouse or partner at a young age, or run away from home. * Become pregnant or a parent of illegitimate children. * Be at risk of becoming poor or homeless, even if the family is already wealthy or middle-class. * Live a reclusive lifestyle without any spouse, partner, children, or friends. * Have auto-destructive or potentially self-damaging behaviors. * Join a cult to find the acceptance they never had at home, or at a minimum, have differing philosophical or religious beliefs from what they were previously taught. * Strive (as young adults) to live far away from particular family members or the family as a whole, possibly spending much more time with extended family. * Perpetuate dysfunctional behaviors in other relationships (especially their own children.)

It has been reported to be one of the two largest UK charities for ME/CFS. Activities The organisation informs its members of developments affecting sufferers, carers, family and friends, via its quarterly magazine ME Essential, its website, and other communication media. It promotes its members' interests in medical and political arenas, and in the media. It produces advice on specific aspects of the illness and its effect on sufferers, particularly in its clinical guidance booklet, 'ME/CFS/PVFS : An exploration of the key clinical issues', which informs both practitioners and patients. As of 2005, persons with ME/CFS in the UK still had difficulty obtaining treatment literature from their General Practitioners' surgeries. A majority of persons with the illness were able to obtain treatment literature from the ME Association. The ME Association has conducted a number of patient surveys, including in 2010 and 2015, which have generally reported that most patients found activity pacing one of the most helpful treatments, and they found graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy more harmful than helpful. The ME Association has campaigned for increased biomedical research on ME/CFS and improved treatment within the UK. The ME Association funds research into ME/CFS, and in 2018 was reported to be funding the running costs of the UK ME/CFS Biobank. Positions= Illness name  In 2001, the ME Association decided to use the term Myalgic Encephalopathy rather than Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, stating that they felt this was a more appropriate description and was a name that dictors \\"cannot simply dismiss on the grounds that it is pathologically inaccurate in relation to ME (or research defined cases of CFS)\\".  Treatments  The ME Association (MEA) campaigned against the PACE trial, a very large trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) stating that the money should be spent on biomedical research instead and raising concerns about the methodology. In 2012, a year after the main PACE trial results, the MEA commenced an extensive opinion survey of patients who had used CBT, GET and pacing as interventions for ME/CFS in the UK. They concluded that over 70 percent of patients said exercise therapy worsened their symptoms. Based on the survey's findings, the MEA concluded that GET should not be used for people with ME/CFS. In 2016, the MEA called for graded exercise therapy to be withdrawn and stated that CBT should not be a primary intervention for ME/CFS. In 2018, the MEA repeated that GET should be withdrawn, and this should not be delayed until the ongoing UK's NICE guidelines review was completed. The 2015 MEA survey results concluded that CBT based on the assumption that abnormal beliefs and behaviours are responsible for maintaining the illness, are inappropriate, and risked a worsening of symptoms. A CBT practitioner's belief that ME/CFS is a psychological illness also resulted in less symptom improvement, more symptom worsening, and dissatisfaction of treatment by persons with ME/CFS. The MEA stated CBT that counsels patients with practical coping skills and dealing with co-morbid conditions may be appropriate and should be available as required to ME/CFS patients the same as other chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cancer, heart disease, and arthritis etc. Pacing was considered, \\"the most effective, safe, acceptable and preferred form of activity management for people with ME/CFS\\". The MEA recommended it should be the major management strategy. The ME association is skeptical of the guidance recommended by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for primary treatment of ME/CFS. The MEA considers CBT with GET not safe for ME/CFS patients, or not effective. The ME Association recommends that persons with ME/CFS consider a pacing approach to the illness. In 2017, the ME Association raised concerns about the use of the controversial lightning process, with medical advisor Charles Shepherd claiming it was \\"pseudoscience\\" for a treatment to claim effectiveness for so many different illnesses at once. Additionally, MEA advocates that NICE has not studied the physiological aspects of persons with ME/CFS.  Coronavirus fatigue  In 2020, the ME Association's medical advisor said that the coronavirus may lead to some patients developing post-viral fatigue or post-viral fatigue syndrome, which could then lead to ME/CFS. In May 2020 the MEA published several advice leaflets about COVID-19. ReferencesExternal links * What is ME/CFS?

Following the donation of an engagement ring to help raise funds for the charity, the very first appeal was launched and brought in a substantial ¬£4,000.The charity initially began as a hospital, opened in 1930 by the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, which specialised in the radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and other diseases. In 1944, the hospital was destroyed in the war by a direct hit in an air raid. In 1948, Bernard Robinson OBE set about re-establishing the hospital and decided to separate from the National Health Service (NHS). He set up the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation to perpetuate the name of the pioneering scientist, Marie Curie. By 1950 the ongoing appeal had raised a staggering ¬£30,000 and two years later the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation officially became a charity - number 207994. An extensive nationwide survey was undertaken to help identify medical, nursing and research needs in relation to cancer. The results formed the basis of the work of the Foundation and, largely, still do today. Executive Board The Executive Board delegate the day-to-day management of Marie Curie to their Chief Executive, Matthew Reed , who appoints the Executive Board, made up of the charity‚Äôs most senior managers. Who are:- Matthew Reed (Chief Executive) Jude Bridge(Executive Director, Marketing, Fundraising and Public Affairs) Caroline Hamblett FCIPD (Director of Services) Charles Hooper (Chief Information Officer) Penny Laurence-Parr (General Counsel and Company Secretary) Dr Bill Noble (Medical Director) Dee Sissons MSc RGN (Director of Nursing) Andrew Whitehead ACA (Director of Finance) Belinda Brown (Director of People Planning and Performance) The accounts for the year ending 31 March 2015 showed that the chief executive was paid a salary of ¬£166,650 and a total of 41 staff took home a salary of more than ¬£60,000 ‚Äì up from 30 the previous year. (For comparison Oxfam's CEO Winnie Byanyima was paid a salary of ¬£122,538, and 70 staff took home a salary of more than ¬£60,000 ‚Äì up from 10 the previous year. Macmillan Cancer Support had 56 staff take home a salary of more than ¬£60,000 (2014) Nurses An IPSOS MORI survey shows that seven out of ten carers say that people with a terminal illness don't get the care and support they need. Marie Curie Nurses, provide home care for thousands of people with terminal illnesses across the UK every year. The nurses also provide practical and emotional support for families and carers. Hospices Marie Curie provides the largest number of hospice beds outside the NHS and voluntary contributions, together with statutory government NHS funding are essential to continue providing these services. There are hospices in Belfast, Bradford, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London (Hampstead), Liverpool, Newcastle, Penarth (near Cardiff), and the Marie Curie Hospice, West Midlands in Solihull. Research Marie Curie is a leading funder of palliative care research to find better ways of caring for people with terminal illnesses. *Marie Curie supports and funds the work of three long term Palliative Care Research Facilities across the UK - The Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Unit, London; The Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute, Liverpool; and The Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Centre, Cardiff. *Marie Curie awards research project grants in open competition to the Marie Curie Cancer Care Research Programme annually and also funds an ongoing portfolio of grants from the Dimbleby Marie Curie Cancer Care Research Fund. *Marie Curie encourages research across its hospices and nursing service. To help achieve this, three posts are held through its Research Facilitator Programme at Marie Curie Hospices in Belfast, Edinburgh and the West Midlands. *Marie Curie hosts an annual research conference jointly held with the Palliative Care Section of the Royal Society of Medicine. The aim of the conference is to support the translation of research findings into practice. Fundraising Marie Curie adopted the daffodil emblem in 1986; it is also the emblem of leading cancer charities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. Marie Curie Cancer Care's biggest fundraising campaign is called The Great Daffodil Appeal and takes place throughout March each year. Actor Hugh Grant did publicity work for the organization in 2008 after his mother received care from Marie Curie Cancer Research. Followed in more recent years by Stephen Mangan, Alison Steadman, and Ranulph Fiennes. Notable campaigns The Great Daffodil Appeal is the flagship fundraising campaign of Marie Curie Cancer Care. Companies and individuals sell daffodil pin badges and wear yellow in support. Walk to Remember (formerly Walk Ten) is a 10 km walk in various locations around the UK. Marie Curie's Blooming Great Tea Party runs over two weeks in June where individuals and companies provide tea and cakes in order to raise funds for the charity.

() is a Canadian sugar refining company that was established in 1854 and the first refining cane sugar in Montreal, Quebec. Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario (with an additional packaging plant in Belleville, Ontario), the company is a subsidiary of the multinational American Sugar Refining. History Redpath newspaper ad, 1916 Redpath's 1947 Divco truckRedpath ‚Äì request our truck The business was founded in 1854 in Montreal, Quebec, by Scots-Quebecer entrepreneur John Redpath (1796‚Äì1869). Located on the bank of the Lachine Canal, the sugar refinery complex was the first of its kind in Canada, using sugar cane imported from the British West Indies. Its construction was part of the economic boom that, during the 19th century, turned Montreal from a small town to (then) the largest city in Canada and the country‚Äôs economic engine. In 1857, John Redpath's eldest son, Peter Redpath (1821‚Äì1894), became a partner; his brother-in-law, George Alexander Drummond (1829‚Äì1910), joined the firm in 1861. Unable to compete with the giant low-cost producers in the United States, for the three years between 1876 and 1878, the company ceased operations. Following the tariff protections implemented under the National Policy by the government of Sir John A. Macdonald, the company reopened in 1879, as did St. Lawrence Sugar, a new competitor established in Montreal. At that time, the company was reorganized as the Canada Sugar Refining Company Limited.Company profile of Redpath Sugar George Drummond took over when Peter Redpath retired in 1888. Under his guidance, the company's success allowed for construction of a new six-storey plant built on the existing site, doubling production capacity. In 1930, the company merged with the Dominion Sugar Company Limited of Chatham, Ontario, and became known as the Canada and Dominion Sugar Company Limited. In 1959, a controlling interest in the company was acquired by Tate & Lyle, a British firm. In 1973, the company changed its name to Redpath Industries Limited. The Redpath Sugar Refinery was built on the Toronto waterfront in the late 1950s, at the time of the completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and it is still in operation. Tate family member Saxon Tate and David Davis, later a senior Conservative politician, were sent from Britain to restructure its Canadian subsidiary. In 1980, the Montreal plant was closed and production was shifted to Toronto. In 2007, the company became a subsidiary of American Sugar Refining (ASR Group) following the sale of Tate & Lyle's sugar division, and it was renamed as Redpath Sugar Ltd. at that time.Redpath Sugar Ltd. ‚Äì Federal Corporation Information. Refinery The Redpath Sugar Refinery is a sugar storage, refining and museum complex in Toronto used by Redpath for sugar production. The refinery was founded in 1958 and has included a museum since 1979. Imagery Redpath sugar label, 2004 The Redpath sugar label shown at right celebrated the company's 150th anniversary in 2004.

In 2015 the Opah was discovered to have near whole body endothermy, a form of regional endothermy.Wegner, Nicholas C., Snodgrass, Owen E., Dewar, Heidi, John, Hyde R. Science. \\"Whole-body endothermy in a mesopelagic fish, the opah, Lampris guttatus\\". pp. 786‚Äì789. Retrieved 14 May 2015. This is different from \\"warm blooded\\" in the sense of birds and mammals and is not the first fish discovered with this ability. It may be the most completely endothermic fish. Other species of fish also possess this ability, such as tuna and some sharks. Only two living species occur in a single genus: Lampris (from the Greek lamprid-, \\"brilliant\\" or \\"clear\\"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34th parallel south as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus Lampris and the other in the monotypic Megalampris, are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller. Description Lampris guttatus Opahs are deeply keeled, compressed, discoid fish with conspicuous coloration: the body is a deep red-orange grading to rosy on the belly, with white spots covering the flanks. Both the median and paired fins are a bright vermilion. The large eyes stand out, as well, ringed with golden yellow. The body is covered in minute cycloid scales and its silvery, iridescent guanine coating is easily abraded. Opahs closely resemble in shape the unrelated butterfish (family Stromateidae). Both have falcated (curved) pectoral fins and forked, emarginated (notched) caudal fins. Aside from being significantly larger than butterfish, opahs have enlarged, falcated pelvic fins with about 14 to 17 rays, which distinguish them from superficially similar carangids‚Äîpositioned thoracically; adult butterfish lack pelvic fins. The pectorals of opahs are also inserted (more or less) horizontally rather than vertically. The anterior portion of an opah's single dorsal fin (with about 50‚Äì55 rays) is greatly elongated, also in a falcated profile similar to the pelvic fins. The anal fin (around 34 to 41 rays) is about as high and as long as the shorter portion of the dorsal fin, and both fins have corresponding grooves into which they can be depressed. The snout is pointed and the mouth small, toothless, and terminal. The lateral line forms a high arch over the pectoral fins before sweeping down to the caudal peduncle. The larger species, Lampris guttatus, may reach a total length of and a weight of . The lesser-known Lampris immaculatus reaches a recorded total length of just . Regional endothermy The opah is the newest addition to the list of regionally endothermic fish (warm-blooded), with a rete mirabile in its gill tissue structure. Other fish like the tunas, billfish and Lamnid sharks also possess this ability. This was first described in the opah in 2015 as exhibiting counter-current heat exchange in which the arteries, carrying warm blood, from the heart, warm the veins in the gills carrying cold blood.\\"Warm Blood Makes Opah an Agile Predator\\". Fisheries Resources Division of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 12 May 2015. Retrieved 15 May 2015. \\"New research by NOAA Fisheries has revealed the opah, or moonfish, as the first fully warm-blooded fish that circulates heated blood throughout its body...\\" The gills are cooled by contact with cold water. The opah's pectoral muscles generate most of its body heat. The opah retains heat with insulating layers of fat, which insulates the heart from the gills, and the pectoral muscles from the surrounding water. The opah is not homeothermic (maintaining a stable internal temperature) like birds and mammals. Fish like the opah maintain an internal temperature higher than the surrounding water but not a constant temperature the way that mammals do. Mammals are able to maintain a constant temperature, in humans it's around 37 ¬∞C. Humans maintain this temperature regardless of the temperature outside the body via various physiological methods. Fish like the Opah do not do this, they maintain a temperature higher than the water temperature around them but it is still regulated by the water temperature. Most species of fish cannot do this. This ability is what makes the Opah, and other species of fish like Bluefin Tuna, special. Behavior Almost nothing is known of opah biology and ecology. They are presumed to live out their entire lives in the open ocean, at mesopelagic depths of 50 to 500 m, with possible forays into the bathypelagic zone. They are apparently solitary, but are known to school with tuna and other scombrids. The fish propel themselves by a lift-based labriform mode of swimming, that is, by flapping their pectoral fins. This, together with their forked caudal fins and depressible median fins, indicates they swim at constantly high speeds like tuna. Lampris guttatus are able to maintain their eyes and brain at 2 ¬∞C warmer than their bodies, a phenomenon called cranial endothermy and one they share with sharks in the family Lamnidae, billfishes and some tunas. This may allow their eyes and brains to continue functioning during deep dives into water below 4 ¬∞C. Squid and euphausiids (krill) make up the bulk of the opah diet; small fish are also taken. Pop-up archival transmitting tagging operations have indicated, aside from humans, large pelagic sharks, such as great white sharks and mako sharks, are primary predators of opah. The tetraphyllidean tapeworm Pelichnibothrium speciosum has been found in L. guttatus, which may be an intermediate or paratenic host.Scholz et al., 1998. The planktonic opah larvae initially resemble those of certain ribbonfishes (Trachipteridae), but are distinguished by the former's lack of dorsal and pelvic fin ornamentation. The slender hatchlings later undergo a marked and rapid transformation from a slender to deep-bodied form; this transformation is complete by 10.6 mm standard length in L. guttatus. Opahs are believed to have a low population resilience. Species and range Two living species are traditionally recognized, but a taxonomic review in 2018 found that more should be recognized (the result of splitting L. guttatus into several species, each with a more restricted geographic range), bringing the total to six. The six species of Lampris have mostly non-overlapping geographical ranges, and can be recognized based on body shape and coloration pattern. * Lampris australensis Underkoffler, Luers, Hyde & Craig, 2018 Southern spotted opah ‚Äì Southern hemisphere, in the Pacific and Indian oceans. * Lampris guttatus (Br√ºnnich, 1788) North Atlantic opah ‚Äì formerly thought to be cosmopolitan, but now thought to be restricted to the North-Eastern Atlantic including the Mediterranean Sea. * Lampris immaculatus Gilchrist, 1904 southern opah ‚Äì confined to the Southern Ocean from 34¬∞S to the Antarctic Polar Front * Lampris incognitus Underkoffler, Luers, Hyde & Craig, 2018 smalleye Pacific opah ‚Äì central and eastern North Pacific Ocean. * Lampris lauta Lowe, 1860 East Atlantic opah ‚Äì Eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean, Azores and Canary Islands. * Lampris megalopsis Underkoffler, Luers, Hyde & Craig, 2018 bigeye Pacific opah ‚Äì cosmopolitan, including the Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, the Western Pacific Ocean and Chile.

Mr Houghton was fitted with a Jarvik 2000 pump, and is to this day a Guinness World Record holder for the ‚ÄòLongest surviving artificial heart transplant patient.‚Äô In 2005, The National Heart Research Fund changed its name to Heart Research UK and later opened up a regional office in Birmingham.  Grants  Heart Research UK funds medical research through a programme of grants. Novel and Emerging Technologies (NET) Grants, of up to ¬£250,000, are awarded to research projects which focus on the development of new technologies to diagnose, treat and prevent heart disease and related conditions and Translational Research Project (TRP) Grants, are awarded for projects that transfer breakthroughs into practical tools that can be used for patient care. Heart Research UK also awards dedicated grants for Northern Ireland, aimed at encouraging applications and supporting research at hospitals and universities across the whole of the UK. In 2018, building on the success of the Northern Ireland Grants, Heart Research UK launched a similarly dedicated grant for Scotland.  Research  Current medical research being funded by Heart Research UK includes a project with the University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital to develop a much faster technique for imaging the hearts of babies born with congenital heart disease (CHD), a project at the University of Leicester using electrocardiograms (ECG‚Äôs) to measure the risk of sudden cardiac death (SDC), and a project at the Bristol Heart Institute to repair the hearts of babies born with congenital heart disease (CHD) using stem cells from the umbilical cord.  Masterclasses  Since 2012, Heart Research UK have funded ‚ÄòMasterclasses‚Äô, in which leading international and UK experts give surgeons, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and other health professionals the opportunity to gain new skills and knowledge. By the end of 2018, 15 masterclasses will have taken place, covering topics such as heart transplantation, imaging, mitral valve surgery, aortic surgery and exercise prescription for congenital heart disease.  Partnership with Subway  Since 2009, Heart Research UK has been partnered with Subway¬Æ to support customers‚Äô choice for a low fat option. Together, they run the Heart Research UK and Subway¬Æ Healthy Heart grant scheme, an initiative that funds community projects to promote heart health across the UK. These grants are funded by in- store collections and a programme of 5K runs across the UK.

Geography Garlock Fault Zone map Stretching for , it is the second-longest fault in California, and one of the most prominent geological features in the southern part of the state. It marks the northern boundary of the area known as the Mojave Block, as well as the southern ends of the Sierra Nevada and the valleys of the westernmost Basin and Range province. The Garlock Fault runs from a junction with the San Andreas Fault in the Antelope Valley, eastward to a junction with the Death Valley Fault Zone in the eastern Mojave Desert. It is named after the historic mining town of Garlock, founded in 1894 by Eugene Garlock and now a ghost town. Relatively few communities lie directly along the Garlock, as it is primarily situated in the desert, with Frazier Park, Tehachapi, Mojave, and Johannesburg being the closest to it. Geology The Garlock Fault is believed to have developed to accommodate the strain between the extensional tectonics of the Great Basin crust and the right lateral strike-slip faulting of the Mojave Desert crust. Unlike most of the other faults in California, slip on the Garlock Fault is left-lateral; that is, the land on the other side of the fault moves to the left from the perspective of someone facing the fault. Thus, the terrain north of the fault is moving westward and that on the south is moving eastward.  Activity  The Garlock Fault moves at a rate of between 2 and 11 mm a year, with an average slip of around 7 millimeters. While most of the fault is locked, certain segments have been shown to move by aseismic creep, which is motion without resulting earthquakes. The Garlock is not considered to be a particularly active fault, seldom producing any shaking detectable by humans, although it has been known to generate sympathetic seismic events when triggered by other earthquakes and in one instance by the removal of ground water. These events, as well as continuing microearthquake activity and the state of the scarps from previous ruptures, do indicate that the Garlock will produce another major quake at some point in the future. A study published in October 2019 in the journal Science indicated that a part of the Garlock fault slipped after being triggered by the series of earthquakes in the Ridgecrest area which occurred in July 2019. Reports in the Los Angeles Times indicated that a magnitude 8 earthquake along the Garlock fault would have the potential for grave disaster. The last significant ruptures on the Garlock were thought to be in the years 1050 AD and 1500 AD. Research has pinned the interval between significant ruptures on the Garlock as being anywhere between 200 and 3,000 years, depending on the segment of the fault. The most recent notable event in the Garlock Fault Zone was a magnitude 5.7 near the town of Mojave on July 11, 1992. It is thought to have been triggered by the Landers earthquake, just two weeks earlier. However, no surface slippage of the fault itself had been recorded in modern times until 2019. Following a series of earthquakes on nearby minor faults in late July 2019, the Garlock Fault was observed moving about 2 cm (0.8 in) between July and October accompanied by numerous minor earthquakes, a state known as fault creep, and producing a bulge in land observed by satellite radar images.

They were in favour of the South African union and, ultimately, an imperial federation of the British Empire itself. On Milner's retirement, most continued in the service under William Waldegrave Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne (Lord Selborne), who was Milner's successor, and the number two-man at the Colonial Office. The Kindergarten started off with 12 men, most of whom were Oxford graduates and English civil servants, who made the trip to South Africa in 1901 to help Lord Milner rebuild the war torn economy. Quite young and inexperienced, one of them brought with him a biography on Alexander Hamilton. He read the book, and the government of South Africa was rebuilt along the lines of the book, Hamilton's federalist philosophy, and his knowledge of treasury operations.Amery, Leo, My Political Life, Vol I, pgs. 268-69 The name, \\"Milner's Kindergarten\\", although first used derisively by Sir William Thackeray Marriott, was adopted by the group as its catchphrase.Gollin, Alfred, \\"Proconsul in Politics\\", pg. 41 The Boer War The discovery of gold in the Boer (Dutch) Republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, located within the British colony of South Africa in 1867, led to conflict between the two peoples due to the migration of English settlers into the region. Perhaps out of fear of eventual domination from the English, the Boer Government refused to grant citizenship rights to the settlers. Negotiations failed to achieve results, and conflict eventually erupted. An attempt to overthrow the Transvaal Government in late 1895, in a raid led by British Colonial Administrator Starr Jameson, led to embarrassment for the English. The Jameson Raid led to the appointment a trustworthy Governor, Sir Alfred Milner, on 15 February 1897.Nimocks, Walter, \\"Milner's Young Men\\", pgs. 6-8 Still, negotiations with the Boers achieved little. The English then decided to increase their military presence in South Africa, which led to a demand by Boer President Paul Kruger to have the soldiers return home. When the English refused, the Boer Republics declared war. Their initial military successes were eventually overcome by superior British manpower. The war, which lasted from October 1899 to May 1902, was costly to both sides. It was highlighted by sieges and guerrilla warfare on the part of the Boers, and scorched earth tactics and concentration camps (to relocate Boer families) by the British. With the Boer manpower eventually exhausted, a peace treaty was signed on 31 May 1902. The two Boer republics were then absorbed into the British Empire, in exchange for lenient treatment, rebuilding and financial help. Paul Kruger left South Africa for good, leaving the leadership of the Boers in the hands of trustworthy subordinates Louis Botha and Jan Smuts. Why Milner? In response to the Jameson Raid, negotiations between the British and Boer sides came to loggerheads. For the first time, the Kruger Government openly defied the English, and it stepped up its importation of guns and ammunition, much of it from Germany. For their part, the English sought to replace Lord Rosmead, its high commissioner, who was complicit in the raid, and to soften his tough negotiating hand.Nimocks, pg. 8 After six months of searching, and with the approval of Prime Minister Salisbury, Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain chose Sir Alfred Milner.Garvin, J.L., The Life of Joseph Chamberlain, Volume Three, pg. 142 Milner‚Äôs name was suggested to Chamberlain by Lord Selborne, the number two man at the Colonial Office, who was a friend of Milner‚Äôs. Chamberlain had met Milner in 1889 while traveling in Egypt, and Milner subsequently wrote a book, England in Egypt, which Chamberlain is said to have read and praised. After writing to the Prime Minister of his decision on 8 January 1897, Salisbury answered, ‚ÄúYour choice of Milner for the Cape, will, I think, be a success‚Äù.Ibid, pg. 143 It is said by author Nimocks that Milner‚Äôs attitude toward the colonies paralleled that of the best politicians in government, so that may have been why he was picked.Nimocks, pg. 10 The public was informed of the decision on 15 February 1897.pg. 31 Milner met with the King three days later, and sailed for South Africa on April 17th. Before he left, Chamberlain told him, ‚Äúto stand upon our rights and wait events‚Äù.Nimocks, pg. 18 After a year of studying the situation in South Africa, Milner wrote back to his boss and said, ‚ÄúTwo wholly antagonistic systems-a mediaeval race oligarchy, and a modern industrial state, recognizing no difference of status between various white races-cannot permanently live side by side in what is after all one country. The race-oligarchy has got to go, and I see no signs of it removing itself.\\"Ibid, pg. 18 In fact, war did break out seventeen months later. Lord Milner's Influence As a result of the South African War, reconstruction efforts were Lord Milner's responsibility. The necessity to delegate responsibility into trustworthy hands prompted him to gather together a group of young men from Oxford University and the Colonial Office. At the suggestion of the Earl of Cromer, he said: > \\"...I mean to have young men. There will be a regular rumpus and a lot of > talk about boys and Oxford and jobs and all that...Well I value brains and > character more than experience. First class men of experience are not to be > got. Nothing one could offer would tempt them to give up what they > have...No! I shall not be here for very long but when I go I mean to leave > behind me young men with plenty of work in them...\\"Gollin, pgs. 40-41 Most of Lord Milner's proteges worked in the Transvaal, where reconstruction was needed the most. They continued in their positions after his departure for England on 2 April 1905, serving under Lord Selborne until responsible government was formed in 1907.Thompson, L.M., \\"The Unification of South Africa\\", pg. 61 The Kindergarten formed close relationships with one another, and all remained friends until the day they died. Work in South Africa=Pre Reconstruction Milner's Kindergarten The following personnel arrived before the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed on 31 May 1902: The first person to be hired by Lord Milner was Peter Perry. A graduate of Oxford and an employee of the Colonial Office, he was sent to South Africa in 1900 to replace George Fiddes, Lord Milner's retiring personal secretary. In July 1901, he became Assistant Imperial Secretary with responsibility over native (indigenous) territories. He negotiated with the Portuguese to acquire native (African) labour for the mines. In 1903, he resigned and joined private industry to head up recruitment and working conditions of African labour on the Rand (greater Johannesburg).Marlowe, John, \\"Milner, Apostle of Empire\\", pg. 135 Next came Lionel Curtis. Another Oxford Graduate, Curtis came to South Africa in late 1900 and was employed by Perry as an assistant secretary. He was present for the writing of the Johannesburg Municipal Charter, and became the city's Town Clerk when the charter took effect. He also established a monthly journal, The State, with financing from Abe Bailey, to help unite the war torn country. In 1906, a book titled Alexander Hamilton found its way to South Africa, where, by chance, it was read by Curtis. It described Hamilton's role in creating the United States Constitution by listing instance after instance where the cause for a federal union was strong enough to make the United States secure and prosperous.Nimocks, pg. 127 The book was used as the basis for writing a new South African Constitution. Third was Patrick Duncan. Duncan, an Oxford Civil Servant who worked at the Inland Revenue, was invited by Lord Milner to South Africa in 1901 to become Treasurer of the Transvaal. He later became Colonial Secretary of the Transvaal, supported by Richard Feetham as Assistant Colonial Secretary, and John Dove as his assistant.Thompson, J. Lee, \\"Forgotten Patriot\\", pg. 221 Like Perry, Geoffrey Robinson was another Oxford alumni working at the Colonial Office. His connection brought him to South Africa later in 1901 to work for Lord Milner. He became Secretary for Municipal Affairs in the Transvaal. Upon Lord Milner's departure from South Africa in April 1905, Robinson became editor of the Johannesburg Star. Hugh Wyndham, an Oxford graduate who travelled to South Africa for health reasons, secured a private secretariat position with Lord Milner. Reconstruction Lionel Hichens, also from Oxford, worked for the Egyptian Ministry of Finance before Lord Milner invited him to South Africa to become Treasurer of Johannesburg Municipality. He later became Treasurer of the Transvaal. Richard Feetham arrived in Johannesburg in early 1902. He was appointed Johannesburg Deputy Town Clerk until 1907, when he was elected to the Transvaal Legislature. He then became a member of national Parliament in 1915, and a judge in 1923, rising to become a South African Supreme Court Appeals judge. Mr. John Dove was an Oxford graduate lawyer who succeeded Lionel Hichens as Municipal Treasurer of Johannesburg.Gollin, pg. 136 Robert Brand, of Oxford, arrived in South Africa in late 1902. He was made secretary of the Intercolonial Council, to coordinate the economies of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony. He served on the staff of the Transvaal Governor until 1909. Like Brand, Philip Kerr, from Oxford, arrived in South Africa in 1902 and joined the staff of the Transvaal Governor.The Times, 3/10/60, pg. 15 Dougal Malcolm, also of Oxford, arrived in South Africa upon the departure of Lord Milner in April 1905, to become the personal secretary to Milner's successor, Lord Selborne. Herbert Baker, an architect by training, arrived in South Africa in 1892, where he met Cecil Rhodes. At Lord Milner's request, Baker helped rebuild the Transvaal by designing many public buildings. Today he is considered the father of South African architecture.Marlowe, pg. 218 John Buchan, the 12th Oxford graduate, was recruited by Leo Amery for South African service in 1901, and was placed in charge of health and sanitary conditions of detention facilities.Nimocks, pgs. 25-26 Arthur Basil Williams, also a graduate from Oxford, worked in the Transvaal Education Department for two years. Sir George Fiddes, an Oxford lawyer, worked for the Colonial Office and was assigned to Lord Milner's staff in 1897. He worked as a secretary for Lord Milner, Lord Roberts, and the new Transvaal Government until 1902. Sir John Hanbury-Williams was a military officer and Lord Milner's military advisor from 1897 to 1900. Mr. Main Walrond, an Oxford Graduate, was known to Lord Milner from his days in Egypt. He was invited to South Africa by Lord Milner, and served as his assistant secretary from 1897 to 1905. Sir Fabian Ware, a non-Oxford graduate, served as Assistant Director of Education, and later Director of Education for the Transvaal, from 1901 to 1905. Of controversy was a decision to require all schoolchildren to learn English. The matter was finally decided after World War II, when all Dutch speaking people agreed to the request. William Monypenny, a graduate of Dublin University, was editor of the Johannesburg Star, and later a British officer, when he joined Lord Milner's Administration as Director of Civil Supplies. Later Prominence Many of these men themselves attained public prominence after their experience as members of Milner's Kindergarten. The group often met at Stonehouse, Sir Herbert Baker's private residence in Parktown. The original members were: * Robert Henry Brand, 1st Baron Brand (1878‚Äì1963): Upon returning to England, Brand became a managing director at the Investment Banking firm of Lazard Brothers, holding the position until 1944. In 1946 he was bequeathed the title of Baron. According to Carroll Quigley, he was the leader of the Kindergarten from 1955 to 1963. * Sir Patrick Duncan (1870-1943): While most of the Kindergarten returned to England in 1909, Duncan stayed behind. He entered South African politics, rising to become Governor General of South Africa from 1937 to 1943. * Sir Herbert Baker (1862‚Äì1946): Although not technically part of the Kindergarten, Baker also stayed behind. He established an architectural firm in South Africa in 1902, he designed dozens of public buildings, he eventually returned to England, and was knighted in 1926. * William Lionel Hichens (1874‚Äì1940): After leaving the Colonial Office in 1907, Hitchens found almost immediate success as Chairman of Cammell Laird & Co., a major ship building company, and later as the Director of various railroad companies. * Hugh A. Wyndham (1877-1963): Upon returning to England, Wyndham became a professional writer, authoring a number of books on English history and Colonialism. He inherited the title of Earl in 1952. * Richard \\"Dick\\" Feetham (1874-1965): Like Patrick Duncan, Feetham stayed behind in South Africa. A lawyer, chairman of the Irish Boundary Commission, and eventually a South African Appellate Judge, Feetham was the last surviving member of the Kindergarten. He died in Natal Colony on 5 November 1965.The Times, 11/18/65, pg. 17 * Lionel Curtis (1872-1955): With Lord Milner's death in 1925, Curtis became the de facto leader of the Kindergarten until his death in 1955. He was a founder and editor of The Round Table Journal. An Oxford professor in private practice, Curtis also founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs. * F. (Peter) Perry (1873-1935): Peter Perry recruited Chinese workers for the South African mines, he left South Africa for Canada in 1912, and like Brand, took up an Investment Banking career at the London-based financial firm of Lazard Brothers. * Sir Dougal Orme Malcolm (1877‚Äì1955): Malcolm left the Civil Service in 1912 to become Director of the British South Africa Company, which he held for 37 years. * John Dove (1872‚Äì1934): After returning to England in 1911, Dove became the chief editor of The Round Table Journal, a position he held until his death. * Philip Kerr, The 11th Marquess of Lothian (1880‚Äì1940): Arriving back in England in 1909, Kerr was editor of The Round Table Journal until 1916, private secretary to Prime Minister Lloyd George during World War I, and appointed a trustee over the Rhode's Trust in 1925. He received his nobility rank in 1930, and went on to become British Ambassador to the United States of America from 24 April 1939Butler, pgs. 257-258The Times, April 25, 1939, pg. 14 until the time of his death on 12 December 1940. * Geoffrey Dawson (1874‚Äì1944): Geoffrey Robinson (changed to Dawson in 1917) left South Africa in 1910, after five years as editor of the Johannesburg Star, to become the chief editor of The Times of London newspaper from 1912 to 1919, and 1922 to 1941. Other members included: * John Buchan, Lord Tweedsmuir (1875-1940): Upon returning home from South Africa in 1903, Buchan wrote three books in one year. He was elected to Parliament in 1927, and from 1935 to 1940 was appointed Governor-General of Canada. * Arthur Frederick Basil Williams (1867-1950): Returning home in 1910, Williams became a writer, history professor, and English historian. * Sir George V. Fiddes (1858-1936): Upon his return to the Colonial office in 1902, Fiddes served as Permanent Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1916 to 1921. He received the highest order of knighthood, the G.C.M.G., in 1917. * Sir John Hanbury-Williams (1858-1946): After returning to London in 1900, Williams become Military Secretary to both the Secretary of State for War and the Governor-General of Canada. He headed up the British military mission in Russia during World War I, before leading the British Prisoners of War Department in the Hague in 1917. Williams retired as a major general in 1919, and was knighted for a third time in 1926. * Maine Swete Osmond Walrond (1870-1927): \\"Ozzy\\", a Colonial Office employee, returned to Egypt from 1917 to 1921, where, assigned to the Intelligence Section in Cairo, he assisted Lord Milner with his mission to keep Egypt in the Empire. Walrond received English knighthood in 1901. He was related to Philip Kerr.Oliver, pgs. 214-217 * Sir Fabian Ware (1869-1949): Ware returned home in 1905. In the World War, he headed an ambulance unit for the Red Cross, was put in charge of Graves Registration for the Army in 1916, and become a permanent member of the Imperial War Graves Commission in 1919. He was knighted and recognized by the King for his service in both world wars. * William Flavelle Monypenny (1866-1912): Monypenny returned to London in 1903, and while working for The Times, became a director of the company in 1908. He died of heart failure at the age of 46. Many of these men continued to associate formally after their South African service through their founding of The Round Table Journal, which was established to promote Imperial Federation. Patrick Duncan's obituary in the journal's September 1943 edition, may best describe their ethos: > Duncan became the doyen [leader] of the band of brothers [in South Africa], > Milner's young men, who were nicknamed ... The Kindergarten, then in the > first flush of youthful enthusiasm. It is a fast aging and dwindling band > now; but it has played a part in the Union of South Africa colonies, and it > is responsible for the foundation and conduct of The Round Table. For forty > years and more, so far as the vicissitudes of life have allowed, it has kept > together; and always, while looking up to Lord Milner and to his successor > in South Africa, the late Lord Selborne, as its political Chief, has revered > Patrick Duncan as the Captain of the band. Non Kindergarteners Prior to the Oxford arrivals, Lord Milner had administrative help from the following officials:O'Brien, Terence, \\"Milner\\", pg. 218 * Lord Basil Temple Blackwood (1870-1917): Lord Blackwood was a secretary for Lord Milner from 1901 to 1907, occasionally filing in as Colonial Secretary and Deputy Governor. However, he was not involved in Kindergarten decision making.Nimocks, pg. 45 Blackwood was appointed colonial secretary to Barbados from 1907 to 1910. An artist, he illustrated many children‚Äôs books. He was a lieutenant in the B.E.F. during the Great War, and was killed in a German night raid on 4 July 1917. * Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams (1858-1920): Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Orange River Colony in January 1901, rising to Governor in 1907.Thompson, J. Lee, pg. 221 He returned to England in 1911, and was appointed Governor of Queensland (Australia) from 1915 to 1920. He died suddenly, of a lung infection, on 13 April 1920. * Sir Henry Wilson (1864-1922): Sir Henry Wilson was a military advisor to Lord Milner, and like Goold-Adams, played a significant role in reconstructing Orange River Colony. As head of the British Army (CIGS) from 19 February 1918 to 19 February 1922, he was Lord Milner's subordinate during World War I. General Wilson was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army at the front door to his house on 22 June 1922. A Step Back When negotiating the peace treaty, General Herbert Kitchener won over hardliner Jan Smuts by telling him that the upcoming English elections will probably result in the election of a liberal Prime Minister. With his election, he would likely allow the Boers complete freedom of governing. With this knowledge, the Boers voted in favor of the peace treaty, 54 to 6. Upon the election of liberal Henry Campbell-Bannerman on 5 December 1905, the Boers went back to free elections and majority rule. Some, but not all of the reforms instituted by the Kindergarten were overturned, and both Louis Botha and Jan Smuts rose as leaders in the new South Africa. Still, the country remained loyal to the crown, and both Smuts and Botha played important contributions to the English during the First World War. Post South Africa In July 1909, with most of their business done in South Africa, Lord Selborne and many members of the Kindergarten returned to England.Marlowe, pg. 238 With experience under their belt, with Lord Milner as their guide, and back in their home country, they renamed their group the Round Table.Gollin, pgs. 163-64 The Roundtablers attracted additions of William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne (Undersecretary at the Colonial Office), Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor and F. S. Oliver (businessman and writer of a book on Alexander Hamilton). Despite their affiliation with South Africa and colonialism, which was a polarizing matter to much of England, \\"the group scorned any connection with political parties\\".Gollin, pg. 164 The dominant political factions of the day were the Unionist government and the Liberal Party. The unpopular war forced an early end to the conservative government of Arthur Balfour in December 1905, and to the reign of conservative leadership (in place since 1895). With the generation of imperial leadership Lord Milner identified with (Balfour, Chamberlain, Salisbury & Goschen) sidelined, he found himself on extended furlough. Meanwhile, the Round Table members drew closer together as a collegial group. Philip Kerr became good friends with Waldorf Astor, R.H. Brand intermarried with the Astor family, and other lifelong friendships developed.. The group met at Oliver's country home, at Lord Salisbury's residence, at Lord Lothian's, and at Waldorf Astor's estate at Cliveden. They decided to get their message of the Empire out to the public and to authorities. Initially, Lionel Curtis came up with the idea of a journal called Magazine, specific to each of the Dominions. This idea was liked. However, for logistical reasons, Lord Milner did not know where all the writers would come from, and possibly due to financial reasons (financing for the final product was never revealed, although part of its funding came from the Rhodes family), a single journal was decided upon. It was called The Round Table, a Quarterly Review of the Politics of the British Empire, and first published in November 1910.https://www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk/journal/history Although its name was changed in 1966, it is still published today as The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs.

History Tenovus Cancer Care was established in 1943 by ten businessmen (hence the 'ten of us'). Those men were D.R. Edwards, C.Harris, G. Brinn, C.E. Rolfe, D.Curitz, G.T. Addis, T.J.E. Price, H. Thomas, H.E. Gosling and T.Curitz. Initially, the charity funded a range of local projects in the health and social fields. In 1964, Tenovus Cancer Care embarked on a project that was to influence their work over the next 40 years. D.R. Edwards, the founder Chairman of the group of ten, cut the first sod on the site of the Tenovus Institute for Cancer Research in Cardiff.

Cancer Support Tenovus Cancer Care's first Mobile Support Unit was launched in February 2009. Since its launch, the Unit has opened its services in more than 50 locations and has accommodated over 5,000 patients and visitors. Working with Velindre NHS Trust, Tenovus Cancer Care has been delivering chemotherapy and other cancer treatments in Cwmbran and Nantgarw. During this period, over 10,000 treatments have been provided. In October 2013 the second Mobile Support Unit was launched to deliver support for people with Lymphoedema, an incurable condition which can be a side-effect of cancer treatment.'mobile cancer support/treatment closer to home' at tenovuscancercare.org.uk Accessed 16 January 2018 In October 2018, HRH The Princess Royal unveiled the charity's new ¬£1m Mobile Support Unit, the largest mobile chemotherapy treatment unit in the world.

Calculations show that the two existing Mobile Support Units save the NHS in Wales more than ¬£1m a year, and the new Mobile Support Unit could deliver more than 125,000 treatments over the course its lifetime. In 2014, Tenovus Cancer Care joined forces with Movember and Prostate Cancer UK to launch the UK's first ManVan, a 38-foot American Motorhome which offers men a safe, relaxing space in which to discuss issues around male cancers such as prostate and testicular cancer.'ManVan' mobile cancer support unit celebrates second birthday, 9 June 2016, at itv.com Accessed 18 January 2018 During the three- year project, the ManVan had more than 6,200 visitors, helped over 600 men who had a cancer diagnosis and offered around 4,000 appointments.

Sing with Us Choirs In 2012 Tenovus Cancer Care launched the 'Sing with Us' project, funded by the Big Lottery, to run 15 choirs across Wales for cancer patients, survivors, their families and people bereaved through cancer. Initial research conducted by Cardiff University and Tenovus Cancer Care has proved that singing in the choirs reduces anxiety and pain, as well as helping to improve physical function. Tenovus Cancer Care's work in this area also featured in the October 2012 Channel 4 documentary 'Sing For Your Life', where the charity set up a choir of cancer patients that performed at the Royal Albert Hall.'how we can help you/sing with us/' at tenovuscancercare.org.uk Accessed 16 January 2018'Give hope.

In survival games a large part may be fighting the elements, controlling hunger and thirst, learning to adapt to the environment and exploration. Usually a PvE mode can be played alone, with human companions or with AI companions. The PvE mode may contain a storyline that is narrated as the player progresses through missions. It may also contain missions that may be done in any order. Examples Guild Wars narrates its story by displaying in-game cut scenes and dialogue with non- playable characters (NPCs). To enhance replayability, missions can often be completed many times. Characters playing in this mode are often protected against being killed by other players and/or having their possessions stolen. An example of a game where this is not the case is Eve Online, where players can be, and often are, ambushed by other human players player versus player while attempting to complete a quest. Some games, such as World of Warcraft, offer the player the choice of participating in open-world PvP combat or doing quests without PvP interruption through use of specialty servers and temporary player flags.

He was born in Benson in Rutland County, Vermont, and subsequently moved to Ohio and settled in Oberlin, where he attended public schools. During the American Civil War, he served in the Union Army. After the war he returned to Ohio and settled in Sandusky where he was employed by the Sandusky Tool Company and subsequently became its president. Named president of the Arkansas Railway Company, he relocated to Helena, Arkansas. He was a U.S. Senator from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1879 and did not seek reelection, then the domain of the Arkansas General Assembly. He was a chairman of the Committee on District of Columbia (Forty-fifth Congress). In 1876, he was made a member of the Republican National Committee. In 1880, when the Republicans nominated James A. Garfield for U.S. President and Chester A. Arthur for vice president, Dorsey became the secretary of the Republican National Committee. His reputation was tarnished, though, by the Star route scandal, in which Dorsey and his partners were accused of defrauding the government of $412,000. Dorsey was defended by noted criminal law attorney Robert G. Ingersoll. Though he was found not guilty, the cost of his defense and the damage to his reputation all but destroyed Dorsey's political and financial ambitions. In 1878 he built the Dorsey Mansion in New Mexico. After Dorsey, no other Republican served as senior Senator from Arkansas until Tim Hutchinson in 1999, upon David Pryor's retirement. No other Republican served in the class 3 Senate seat from Arkansas that Dorsey held until John Boozman in 2011. He engaged in cattle raising and mining in New Mexico and Colorado and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California, where he resided until his death in 1916. He is interred at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, Colorado. Clayton in Union County, New Mexico is named, for a son of Senator Dorsey.

In doing so, he pointed out for the first time the presence of Tertiary strata like those of the Paris Basin, but which included a series of later date. His next work (1821) was an essay on the geology of parts of Normandy, with special reference to the \\"Secondary\\"--or Mesozoic-- strata, which he compared with those of southern England; in this he had the collaboration of Charles Lyell. From 1821-1829 he was professor of geology at the Athenaeum at Paris, and he took a leading part with Ami Boue, G√©rard Paul Deshayes and Jules Desnoyers in the founding of the Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France (1830). In 1831 he became assistant professor and afterwards honorary professor of geology to the faculty of sciences of the Sorbonne. He was on hand with an artist to witness the undersea volcano that produced Ferdinandea (now Graham Bank) off the south coast of Sicily that July; he named it √éle Julia, for its July appearance, and reported in the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France \\"Notes sur l‚Äôile Julia pour servir a l‚Äôhistoire de la formation des montagnes volcaniques\\" in M√©moires de la Soc. G√©ol. de France, 1835 (\\"L‚Äôexploration de √Æle Julia\\" and Geological Society, \\"From out the azure main\\" 31 January 2003 ) In 1848 he was elected to his late mentor Brogniart's seat in the Acad√©mie des sciences Having studied the volcanoes of Italy and Auvergne, he opposed the views of Christian Leopold von Buch regarding craters of elevation, maintaining that the cones were due to the material successively erupted. Like Lyell he advocated a study of the slow and incessant forces in action at present, in order to illustrate the past, the principle in geology called uniformitarianism, discounting catastrophic events. One of his more important memoirs was De la Chronologie des terrains et du synchronisme des formations (1845), in which he expounded the principle of the synchronicity of successive stages of igneous and sedimentary deposition across wide terrains. His most general titles were Documents pour l'histoire des terrains tertiaires (Paris, 1827) and his Trait√© de g√©ographie physique co-authored with E. Bassano (Paris, 1836).

She was originally USS Shackle (ARS-9), a rescue and salvage ship commissioned by the United States Navy for service in World War II. She was responsible for coming to the aid of stricken vessels and received three battle stars during World War II, before a long career with the Coast Guard. Acushnet patrolled the waters of the North Pacific and was one of the last World War II era ships on active duty in the US fleet upon her retirement in 2011. United States Navy service - 1944 to 1946 USS Shackle was laid down on 26 October 1942 by the Basalt Rock Company in Napa, California; launched on 1 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Walker Cochran; and commissioned on 5 February 1944, Lieutenant Charles G. Jenkins, Jr., in command. At the time of its building, the country was at war and in need of more naval vessels. As a result of the necessity, three ships, identified only as \\"naval auxiliaries\\" underwent construction. The project took less than a year to complete and would become fleet rescue and salvage vessels serving in the Pacific Theater. These vessels would later all become Coast Guard cutters. Shackles first station was at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she served as a salvage ship in the West Pacific throughout the remainder of World War II. Shackles first year was spent completing extensive salvage assignments clearing wreckage in the channels at Pearl Harbor and Midway Island. The vessel spent the rest of the year in Guam, Eniwetok, Tinian and Saipan.USCGC Fiftieth Anniversary pamphlet USCGC Acushnet Over 50 Years of Service dated 1994. On February 15, 1945, Shackle sailed for the invasion of Iwo Jima where it successfully completed over 44 diving and salvage assignments. One of these was the battle repair of which was hit by a Japanese shore battery. During March 1945, Shackle served as a supporting unit for the Okinawa invasion. Between D-Day (April 1, 1945) and September 20, 1945, the ship completed 55 salvage and rescue operations on larger naval craft damaged by kamikaze attacks. There were 108 general alarms during the period. Shackle was also assigned to mine sweeping operations in the East China Sea where over 200 enemy mines of all types were sunk or destroyed. Shackle also cleared the vital docking area of the wreckage of sunken Japanese cable laying ship at Yokosuka Naval Base, Tokyo Bay, Japan. During all of these operations the Shackle suffered no damage or casualties. As part of her service in the Pacific Theater Shakle received three World War II battle stars, the WWII Victory Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the Navy Occupation Service Medal. On August 23, 1946 USS Shackle was commissioned into the United States Coast Guard as USCGC Acushnet (WAT-167), a search and rescue vessel and was homeported in Portland, Maine.

Transfer to the United States Coast Guard - 1946 Decommissioned by the United States Navy at the end of World War II, along with her sister ships and , she was quickly transferred to the United States Coast Guard. She remained at San Diego, California, until ordered to San Francisco, California, where, on 29 June, she was decommissioned and transferred to the Coast Guard. First homeported in Portland, Maine as a Coast Guard tug, and renamed USCGC Acushnet (WAT-167), she earned a sound reputation as a dependable friend to fishermen and boaters in distress. North East and International Ice Patrol Service - 1946 to 1968 While in Portland, Maine Acushnet became a friend to the maritime community with her search-and-rescue endeavors. While in Maine, Acushnet not only served as a vessel for SAR, but also as part of the International Ice Patrol. Acushnet and her role in the International Ice patrol was featured in the April 22nd 1957 edition of Life Magazine.Life (1957, April 22) Icy Menace in the North Atlantic: The International Patrol warms all shipping away from the worst invasion of big bergs in years. Life Vol 42, No 16, pages 56-58 Between 1946 and 1959, Acushnet responded to a major fire in Bar Harbor, Maine, salvaged a vessel that ran aground in the Kennebec River, and assisted two tankers that broke in half during a violent storm. On 18 February 1952, Acushnet participated in what is listed as the ten most significant Coast Guard rescues. Two tankers, and , split in two in a fierce storm off Cape Cod, and Acushnet took 18 men off the stern of Fort Mercer in heavy seas. The ships collided twice and the merchant seamen jumped to the safety of Acushnets fantail.Tougias, Michael, The Coast Guard's Most Daring Sea Rescue In the year 1950, Acushnet became active in the International Ice Patrol and spent a total of seven patrol months sharing that responsibility with the cutters Androscoggin and Evergreen. Acushnets salvage gear was removed in late 1959 and replaced with search-and-rescue gear. From 1960 to 1968 Acushnet completed four towing missions for over , assisted a vessel that broke in two, escorted four disabled vessels and assisted in two medevacs. A few of Acushnets more noteworthy cases during that time frame include the following: in 1960, it salvaged the 300-ton USCGC General Greene which had been driven one hundred yards ashore in high winds. One of her more dramatic cases in Portland included the rescue of the entire crew of ten people from the disabled seagoing dredge Cartagena, which was adrift in seas and winds off of Cape Cod on Christmas Day, 1961. In May 1963, Acushnet salvaged a crashed Coast Guard helicopter off Duxbury Beach, Massachusetts. The fall of 1967 took Acushnet south, where the cutter rescued a Cuban refugee from a distressed pleasure craft south of Key West, Florida.

During fiscal year 1970, she underwent conversion during which alterations were made to her hull and scientific equipment, and research and storage spaces were added at a shipyard in San Diego, California. As part of the National Data Buoy Project of NOAA Acushnet spent three years attached to the Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Oceanographic Institute in San Diego, California. Her primary mission on eleven extended deployments through June 1971, the cutter aided in positioning buoys. While serving as a WAGO, Acushnet assisted in only one rescue case a medevac in 1970. Caribbean service ‚Äì 1971 to 1990 In July 1971, Acushnet transferred to the Gulf Coast; and, based at Gulfport, Mississippi, she continued her oceanographic work with the National Data Buoy Center, this time aiding the Mississippi Test Facility. On August 24, 1971 Acushnet, affectionately known to the crew a \\"NOAA's Ark\\", arrived in Gulfport with 64 crew and a 100-ton buoy that was towed from San Diego as its first new support assignment. Once established in Gulfport, Acushnet continued to play a diverse and important role in the search-and- rescue mission. In the fall of 1973 the cutter played a major role in the Key Largo fire south of New Orleans opposite the town of Phoenix. Acushnet was again called to respond after a collision on the Mississippi River. Acushnet and the cutter Dependable were presented the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for extinguishing a fire on the tanker Key Trader after it collided with another vessel, the Norwegian ore ship Baune, and burst into flames in the river. Between the years 1975 and 1978, Acushnet conducted search-and-rescue research of the Gulf of Mexico shelf area, conducted the first marriage on board a Coast Guard vessel since the mid-19th century, and made her first drug seizure of 18 tons of marijuana and 21 smugglers. In late 1978, the cutter embarked on a patrol to participate in the Global Weather Experiment, 140-nation effort to gather worldwide weather information. In 82 days, Acushnet covered over from Peru to New Zealand. For this operation Acushnet received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Additionally in 1978, Acushnet was designated a Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC 167) and was formally assigned law enforcement and search-and- rescue missions. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1979, Mobile, Alabama, was hit by Hurricane Frederick while Acushnet was there in drydock, although no damage occurred to the cutter. Her first patrol out of drydock was immediately canceled and Acushnet was sent to pick up survivors of a collision between an oil tanker and a merchant vessel. From May 17 to June 6, 1980, Acushnet participated in the largest immigration crisis in the history of the Coast Guard, the Mariel Boat Lift from Cuba. The cutter escorted the vessel Red Diamond with 800 refugees into Key West. In addition, she assisted 35 boats, aided 120 refugees directly, and fueled two 41-foot Coast Guard boats. For her efforts, the cutter received the Humanitarian Service Award. During its time in Gulfport, Acushnet interdicted nearly 200 Cuban and Haitian refugees, retrieving some of them from shark-infested waters. Drug interdiction during the rest of the '80s 'proved to be successful. In 1980, Acushnet seized 52 tons of marijuana. Between September and November of the same year, Acushnet confiscated marijuana on 7 vessels totaling a seizure of over 76 tons. Between 1987 and 1989 Acushnet had yet two more seizures of marijuana and hashish oil valued at over 1.5 million. m/v Blind Melon and sloop Stormy Weather. West Coast service - 1990 to 1998 Acushnet moved to Eureka, California in July 1990. During a September patrol, a lookout spotted floating objects in the water. These \\"objects\\" were the three crew members of the fishing boat Miss Patty, which had capsized before it could radio for help. During Operation Sandtrap in July 1991, Acushnet intercepted the sailing vessel Malekula carrying twelve tons of hashish from Indochina. The cutter pulled 32 bales from the burning and sinking Malekula, despite efforts by smugglers to scuttle the sailboat. In October 1991, Acushnet made her first trip to the waters of Alaska. The cutter was diverted for two weeks to coordinate anti-pollution efforts when the 518-foot Hyundai No. 12 ran hard aground near the Shumagin Islands. She also responded to a mayday call made by the fishing vessel Tonquin in the Gulf of Alaska, rescuing one man out of a five-man crew from stormy and frigid waters during a five-day search. The cutter coordinated a search involving several fishing boats and a tanker in the area. As a result, three additional crew members were rescued. Alaska/Bering Sea Patrol service - 1999 to 2011 As the majority of Acushnets patrols became Alaska Patrols, in 1998 she moved to Ketchikan, Alaska where she was employed in law enforcement, fisheries, and search and rescue missions in Alaska. This considerably shortened her transit time to the Bering Sea. On 23 February 2007 Acushnet was designated as the \\"oldest commissioned cutter\\" in the fleet following the decommissioning of USCGC Storis. She carries gold hull numbers to show this distinction, and the formal title of \\"Queen Of The Fleet\\". She was scheduled for decommissioning in late 2008. In March 2008 letters to the editor appeared in the Boston Herald and Maine Sunday Telegram calling for Boston and Portland to consider the Acushnet as a possible museum ship. The 2008 decommissioning was canceled and Acushnet continued to conduct patrols in Alaska until March 2011 when she was auctioned as surplus property by the GSA. Decommissioning On 11 March 2011, Acushnet was decommissioned and retired from active duty after more than 67 years of service. succeeded Acushnet as the Coast Guard's oldest commissioned cutter. According to the Juneau Empire Acushnets duties would be undertaken by a new Fast Response Cutter. According to the Coast Guard's 2010 budget the replacement Fast Response Cutter was not scheduled for arrival in Ketchikan until 2014. After decommissioning, Acushnet was acquired by the non-profit Ocean Guardian for use in environmental protection. However, as of 2019, it is listed for sale. Awards and honors Acushnet has been rewarded for outstanding service on many occasions. Her decorations include: * Presidential Unit Citation * Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award * 2 Coast Guard Unit Commendations * 6 Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendations * Coast Guard E Ribbon * Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Medal with 3 battle stars * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal with \\"Asia\\" Clasp * 4 National Defense Service Medals * Global War on Terrorism Service Medal * 2 Humanitarian Service Medals * Transportation 9-11 Ribbon * 2 Special Operations Service Ribbons ReferencesExternal links * History of the Shackle and Acushnet * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - ARS-9 Shackle - WAT-167 / WAGO-167 / WMEC-167 Acushnet * USCGC Acushnet unit website * The Model Shipwright page with ship's plan drawings * Photos on picryl * LIFE (1957, April 22) Icy Menace in the North Atlantic: The International Patrol warms all shipping away from the worst invasion of big bergs in years.

Jones created the cover art for over 150 books through 1976, as well as venturing into fine art during and after this time. Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta called Jones \\"the greatest living painter\\". Although Jones first achieved fame as simply Jeff Jones and lived for a time as male, she later changed her name and transitioned to female. Early life Jeffrey Durwood Jones was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. As a child, her father was overseas in the military. She graduated from Georgia State College in 1967 with a degree in geology and was keenly interested in art and admired the work of Johannes Vermeer, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, and Rembrandt. Career Jones moved to New York City to pursue an art career and quickly found work drawing comics pages for King Comics, Gold Key Comics, Creepy, Eerie, and Vampirella, as well as Wally Wood‚Äôs Witzend. She painted covers for books, including the Ace paperback editions of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series and Andre Norton's Postmarked the Stars, The Zero Stone, Uncharted Stars and many others. For a period during the early 1970s, Jones also provided illustrations to Ted White's Fantastic. She drew many covers and short stories for a variety of comics publishers including DC Comics, Skywald Publications, and Warren and but generally avoided the superhero genre. In the 1972‚Äì1975 issues of National Lampoon, Jones produced a full page strip entitled Idyl. The Studio From 1975 to 1979 Jones shared a workspace in Manhattan's Chelsea district with Bernie Wrightson, Barry Windsor-Smith, and Michael Kaluta, collectively named The Studio. Dragon's Dream produced a volume of their work in 1979. Industry journalist Tom Spurgeon commented on the broader significance and influence of The Studio in his obituary of Jones at The Comics Reporter: By the early 1980s she had a recurring strip in Heavy Metal titled I'm Age. Cartoonists Walter Simonson and J. D. King said at the time that Jones had a growing interest in expressionism and did not pursue comic work as closely thereafter. Personal life In 1964 while attending Georgia State College, Jones met fellow student Mary Louise Alexander (later notable as writer Louise Simonson). The two began dating and were married in 1966. Their daughter Julianna was born the following year. After graduation, the couple moved to New York City but divorced in the early 1970s. Gender transition As an adult, Jones recalled wanting to be a girl from her earliest memories. She confronted these issues in 1998 and began hormone replacement therapy. Comics writer and journalist Steven Ringgenberg elaborated on the transition in an obituary/tribute to Jones at The Comics Journal: > It's now known from the artist‚Äôs personal writings that she had felt > conflicted about her gender since childhood, always feeling a greater > affinity for the fair sex than for her own maleness. Having grown up as a > product of the patriarchal 1950s, with a domineering war-hero father, Jones > did not know how to cope with her yearning to be female, and felt ashamed. > For years she tried to drown these feelings in alcohol, but, after much > soul-searching, Jones realized that although she‚Äôd been born male, inside > she was a woman.

Like quilts, comforters are generally laid over a top bed sheet (and sometimes also blankets). Duvets are another form of quilt, traditionally filled with feathers, though since the late 20th century often made of synthetic fibres or down alternatives. A comforter is sometimes covered for protection and prolonged use. Comforter covers are similar in principle to pillowcases, usually closed with zippers or buttons. In the United Kingdom the term comforter is not generally used. It is instead called a quilt (or continental quilt), duvet or an eiderdown. A duvet differs in that it is thicker and usually used without blankets or extra sheets. Sometimes a comforter is sold as part of a \\"bed in a bag\\", usually a case of some sort with handles that contains an entire set of bedding in the same or a matching pattern: comforter and top sheet, fitted sheet, pillowcase(s), and perhaps pillow sham(s). Some sets have a duvet and duvet cover (more popular in Europe) in place of a comforter and top sheet. More deluxe sets may include a bed skirt and pillows. Comforters are usually used in the winter season when it is very cold, although a variety of different thicknesses means that they can be used in other seasons as well, with lighter examples being used in warmer weather. Due to the thickness of a comforter or the amount of down/feathers or other filling it has, a person is insulated against cold. Comforter sizes correspond with bed sizes: twin, full, queen, king, and cal- king. Comforter sizes run slightly larger than mattress sizes to allow for draping over the sides of the bed. Typical sizes in the United States for comforters are: * Twin Bed = width √ó length * Queen Bed / Full = width √ó length * King Bed = width √ó length Construction Filling ‚Äì Comforters are filled with layers of natural material such as down feathers, wool, or silk; alternatively, polyester batting is used. Comforters can also be made out of fur, usually with a backing of satin or silk. The loft of the filling determines the weight as well as the level of insulation. The comforter is stitched or quilted to secure the filling and keep it evenly distributed. Shell/Covering ‚Äì The outer shells of comforters are typically made with cotton, silk, or polyester fabrics or blends, of varying thread counts. Comforter shells vary in design and color, often designed to coordinate with other bedding.

The house and grounds are owned and managed by Cambridge City Council. The Hall is most well known for hosting the annual Cambridge Folk Festival, an ever-growing (in size and popularity) event that regularly draws thousands to the park. During the summer months, aside from hosting the Folk Festival, Cherry Hinton Hall is alive with predominantly young families enjoying the wide open grass spaces and the large duck pond which for many is the defining feature of the park along with the vast array of other wildlife living there. Many community activities also take place in the park, such as an archaeological and buildings survey carried out by children at the local St Bede's Inter-Church School, in 2007. In 2007, Cherry Hinton Hall became home to Cambridge International School and later Holme Court School, a specialist school for children with dyslexia and related conditions. It is now home to Oaks International School, which is owned by the International Schools Partnership. The Friends of Cherry Hinton Hall was formed in 2009 as a group concerned about the usage, environment, welfare and future of the park for the benefit of those who use it most.

Other trade routes of the period shown in purple The Radhanites (also Radanites, ; Hebrew sing. ◊®◊ì◊î◊†◊ô Radhani, pl. ◊®◊ì◊î◊†◊ô◊ù Radhanim) were medieval merchants, some of Jewish origin. Only a limited number of primary sources use the term, and it remains unclear whether they referred to a specific guild, or to a clan, or generically to Jewish merchants in the trans- Eurasian trade network. Jewish merchants operated in trade between the Christian and Islamic worlds during the early Middle Ages (approximately 500‚Äì1000). Many trade routes previously established under the Roman Empire continued to function during that period ‚Äì largely through their efforts. Their trade network covered much of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of India and China. Etymology=Middle-Eastern hypothesis Several etymologies have been suggested for the word \\"Radhanite\\". Many scholars, including Barbier de Meynard and Moshe Gil, believe it refers to a district in Mesopotamia called \\"the land of Radhan\\" in Arabic and Hebrew texts of the period. Some maintain that their center was the city of Ray (Rhages) in northern Persia. Still others think the name possibly derives from the Persian terms rah \\"way, path\\" and dƒÅn \\"one who knows\\", meaning \\"one who knows the way\\". English-language (or Western) sources added the suffix -ite to the term, as is done with ethnonyms or names derived from place names. French and Greco-Roman hypothesis Cecil Roth and Claude Cahen, among others, make the same claim about the Rh√¥ne River valley in France, which is Rhodanus in Latin and Rhodanos (·ø¨ŒøŒ¥Œ±ŒΩœåœÇ) in Greek. They claim that the center of Radhanite activity was probably in France as all of their trade routes began there. Activities The activities of the Radhanites are documented by ibn Khordadbeh ‚Äì the postmaster, chief of police (and spymaster) for the province of Jibal, under the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tamid ‚Äì when he wrote Kitab al-Masalik wal-Mamalik (Book of Roads and Kingdoms), in about 870. Ibn Khordadbeh described the Radhanites as sophisticated and multilingual. He outlined four main trade routes utilized by the Radhanites in their journeys; all four began in the Rhone Valley in southern France and terminated on China's east coast. Radhanites primarily carried commodities that combined small bulk and high demand, including spices, perfumes, jewellery, and silk. They are also described as transporting oils, incense, steel weapons, furs, and slaves. Text of Ibn Khordadbeh's account :These merchants speak Arabic, Persian, Roman, the Frank, Spanish, and Slav languages. They journey from West to East, from East to West, partly on land, partly by sea. They transport from the West eunuchs, female slaves, boys, brocade, castor, marten and other furs, and swords. They take ship from Firanja (France), on the Western Sea, and make for Farama (Pelusium). There they load their goods on camel-back and go by land to al-Kolzum (Suez), a distance of twenty-five farsakhs. They embark in the East Sea and sail from al-Kolzum to al-Jar and al-Jeddah, then they go to Sind, India, and China. On their return from China they carry back musk, aloes, camphor, cinnamon, and other products of the Eastern countries to al-Kolzum and bring them back to Farama, where they again embark on the Western Sea. Some make sail for Constantinople to sell their goods to the Romans; others go to the palace of the King of the Franks to place their goods. Sometimes these Jew merchants, when embarking from the land of the Franks, on the Western Sea, make for Antioch (at the head of the Orontes River); thence by land to al-Jabia (al-Hanaya on the bank of the Euphrates), where they arrive after three days‚Äô march. There they embark on the Euphrates and reach Baghdad, whence they sail down the Tigris, to al- Obolla. From al-Obolla they sail for Oman, Sindh, Hind, and China. :These different journeys can also be made by land. The merchants that start from Spain or France go to Sus al-Aksa (in Morocco) and then to Tangier, whence they walk to Kairouan and the capital of Egypt. Thence they go to ar-Ramla, visit Damascus, al-Kufa, Baghdad, and al-Basra, cross Ahvaz, Fars, Kerman, Sind, Hind, and arrive in China. :Sometimes, also, they take the route behind Rome and, passing through the country of the Slavs, arrive at Khamlidj, the capital of the Khazars. They embark on the Jorjan Sea, arrive at Balkh, betake themselves from there across the Oxus, and continue their journey toward Yurt, Toghuzghuz, and from there to China. Historical significance A caravan of dromedaries in Algeria. Much of the Radhanites' overland trade between Tangier and Mesopotamia was by camel. During the Early Middle Ages, Muslim polities of the Middle East and North Africa and Christian kingdoms of Europe often banned each other's merchants from entering their ports. Privateers of both sides raided the shipping of their adversaries at will. The Radhanites functioned as neutral go-betweens, keeping open the lines of communication and trade between the lands of the old Roman Empire and the Far East. As a result of the revenue they brought, Jewish merchants enjoyed significant privileges under the early Carolingian dynasty in France and throughout the Muslim world, a fact that sometimes vexed local Church authorities. While most trade between Europe and East Asia had historically been conducted via Persian and Central Asian intermediaries, the Radhanites were among the first to establish a trade network that stretched from Western Europe to Eastern Asia. More remarkable still, they engaged in this trade regularly and over an extended period of time, centuries before Marco Polo and ibn Battuta brought their tales of travel in the Orient to the Christians and the Muslims, respectively. Indeed, ibn Battuta is believed to have traveled with the Muslim traders who traveled to the Orient on routes similar to those used by the Radhanites. While traditionally many historians believed that the art of Chinese papermaking had been transmitted to Europe via Arab merchants who got the secret from prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Talas, some believe that Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites were instrumental in bringing paper-making west. Joseph of Spain, possibly a Radhanite, is credited by some sources with introducing the so-called Arabic numerals from India to Europe. Historically, Jewish communities used letters of credit to transport large quantities of money without the risk of theft from at least classical times. This system was developed and put into force on an unprecedented scale by medieval Jewish merchants such as the Radhanites; if so, they may be counted among the precursors to the banks that arose during the late Middle Ages and early modern period. Some scholars believe that the Radhanites may have played a role in the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism. In addition, they may have helped establish Jewish communities at various points along their trade routes, and were probably involved in the early Jewish settlement of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, China and India. Much of the Radhanites' Indian Ocean trade was via coastal cargo ships such as this dhow. Besides ibn Khordadbeh, the Radhanites are mentioned by name only by a handful of sources. Ibn al- Faqih's early 10th century Book of the Countries mentions them, but much of ibn al-Faqih's information was derived from ibn Khordadbeh's work. Sefer haDinim, a Hebrew account of the travels of Yehuda HaKohen ben Meir of Mainz, named Przemy≈õl and Kiev as trading sites along the Radhanite route. In the early 12th century, a French-Jewish trader named Isaac ben Dorbolo wrote that he traveled with Radhanite merchants to Poland. End of the Radhanite age The fall of the Tang China in 908 and the collapse of the Khazarian state at the hands of the Rus' some sixty years later (circa 968‚Äì969) led to widespread chaos in Eurasia. Trade routes became unstable and unsafe, a situation exacerbated by the rise of expansionist Turco-Persianate states, and the Silk Road largely collapsed for centuries. This period saw the rise of the mercantile Italian city-states, especially the maritime republics, Genoa, Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi, who viewed the Radhanites as unwanted competitors. The economy of Europe was profoundly affected by the disappearance of the Radhanites. For example, documentary evidence indicates that many spices in regular use during the early Middle Ages completely disappeared from European tables in the 10th century. Jews had previously, in large parts of Western Europe, enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade. Some have speculated that a collection of 11th century Jewish scrolls discovered in a cave in Afghanistan‚Äôs Samangan Province in 2011 may be a ‚Äúleftover‚Äù of the Radhanites, who had mostly disappeared by the 11th century.

Plymouth Rock was laid down by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Mississippi on 4 May 1953; launched on 7 May 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Francis C. Denebrink; and commissioned on 29 November 1954, Commander D. Bontecou in command. Service history After sailing in January 1955 to Norfolk, her homeport, Plymouth Rock conducted shakedown off the East Coast and in the Caribbean. In the summer of 1955 she transported men and equipment to early warning sites in the far north. In March 1956 she deployed to the Mediterranean for amphibious operations, returning in October. During 1957 she made numerous trips to the Caribbean, and again resupplied the Arctic Distant Early Warning Line. From May to October 1958 Plymouth Rock operated as a unit of the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, participating in the landing of U.S. Marines in Lebanon in July. After developing the concept of \\"vertical envelopment\\" by helicopter assault in early 1959, she made a Caribbean cruise to Puerto Rico and Cuba. In February 1960 she participated in \\"Operation Amigo\\", carrying support helicopters and other equipment for President Dwight Eisenhower's visit to South America. From March to December, she again deployed to the Mediterranean. During 1961 Plymouth Rock made several cruises to the Caribbean and one to the Mediterranean, including work on Project Mercury and Project ASROC. During 1962 she made several deployments to the Caribbean, and was a member of the blockade force during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 7 May 1963 she again deployed to the Mediterranean, returning in October. In 1964 Plymouth Rock made two Caribbean cruises and then took part in Operation Steel Pike I off the coast of Spain, the largest amphibious operation since World War II. Early 1965 found Plymouth Rock on another Caribbean cruise. From 28 January to 7 March 1966 she was involved in H-Bomb recovery operations off Palomares, Spain following the Palomares hydrogen bombs incident.Melson, June 1967, p.31 Late 1966 found her once again in the Caribbean, providing for the victims of Hurricane Inez in Haiti. After three Caribbean cruises in early 1967, Plymouth Rock deployed to northern Europe. She made two more Caribbean deployments in 1968. From June to July 1969 she again deployed to northern Europe. Plymouth Rock was decommissioned on 30 September 1983 and transferred to the Maritime Administration on 8 November 1989 and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 24 February 1992 and she was sold for scrapping, 25 August 1995, to Peck Recycling, Richmond, Virginia, for $268,707.

World War II The ship was laid down by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company of Toledo, Ohio, on 14 July 1941. Storis was launched on 4 April 1942 and commissioned on 30 September 1942 as an ice patrol tender. Initially assigned to the North Atlantic during World War II, Storis participated in the Greenland Patrols.Scheina, p 91 She was tasked with patrolling the east coast of Greenland to prevent the establishment of German weather stations. During her first years, Storis operated in the very waters from which her name was derived. Originally to be named Eskimo, the U.S. Department of State objected to the name of the new cutter on the basis that the natives of Greenland would be offended by the name.Johnson, p 214 \\"Storis\\" is a Scandinavian word meaning \\"great ice.\\" On 10 June 1943, she began escorting convoy GS-24 from Narsarssuak to St. John's, Newfoundland, in company with the (flag), , , and , the convoy consisting of USAT Fairfax and . At 0510 on the 13th, dense black and yellow smoke was reported rising from the Escanaba. She sank at 0513. Storis and Raritan were ordered to investigate and rescue survivors while the rest of the convoy began zigzagging and steering evasive courses to avoid submarines. At 0715 the two cutters returned, having rescued 2 survivors and found the body of Lt. Robert H. Prause, which was on the Raritan. No explosion had been heard by the other escort vessels. The entire crew of 103 of the Escanaba was lost with the exception of these two men. Post World War II career Following the war, the homeport of Storis was changed from Boston to Curtis Bay, Maryland. On 15 September 1948, Storis was reassigned to Juneau, Alaska where she participated in the Bering Sea Patrol, which entailed delivering medical, dental and judicial services to isolated native villages in the far reaches of the territory. At the same time, Storis assisted in establishing Alaskan LORAN radio-navigation stations, provided supplies for the Distant Early Warning Line and conducted hydrographic surveys in the uncharted waters off the Arctic. On 1 July 1957, Storis departed in company with the Coast Guard Cutters and to search for a deep draft channel through the Arctic Ocean and to collect hydrographic information. Shortly after her return in late 1957, the Storis was reassigned to her new homeport of Kodiak, Alaska. In 1972, Storis underwent a major renovation converting her from a light icebreaker to a medium endurance cutter. With the change in designation, there also came a change in primary duties. The primary functions of Storis shifted to enforcing laws and treaties of the domestic and foreign fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Storis underwent another major maintenance overhaul in 1986 that replaced her power plant and expanded her living quarters to include a new berthing area for women and a lounge for the crew. Media Storis participated in the rescue of the fishing vessel Alaskan Monarch, off Saint Paul Island, in March 1990. Video of this incident often appears on TV shows such as Deadliest Catch, to illustrate the dangers of working in Bering Sea waters. Storis also had a cameo in the 2006 film The Guardian. Decommissioning Storis was decommissioned in a ceremony in Kodiak on 8 February 2007. The cutter then sailed to Alameda, California, where it was made ready for its immediate destination as part of the \\"Mothball Fleet\\" at Suisun Bay. In July 2012 the nomination of the Storis for listing on the National Register of Historic Places was accepted by the State of California. It was formally listed on the Register on 31 December 2012. On 12 June 2013 the Storis was put up for public auction by the General Services Administration with a starting bid of US$60,000 after an unforeseen \\"procedural difficulty\\" ended negotiations with the Storis Museum. However the auction failed to reach its reserve price when the auction closed on 27 June 2013. The Storis was towed on 25 October 2013 from California to Mexico where the ship was scheduled to be scrapped.\\"Former Coast Guard cutter Storis headed to scrap yard\\", News, Navy Times website Awards *Coast Guard Presidential Unit Citation with Hurricane Device *Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award *Coast Guard Unit Commendation (8 awards) *Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation (7 awards) *Coast Guard E Ribbon (11 awards) *Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation *American Campaign Medal *European-African- Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star *World War II Victory Medal *National Defense Service Medal with three service stars *Coast Guard Arctic Service Medal (8 awards) *Global War on Terrorism Service Medal *Humanitarian Service Medal *Special Operations Service Ribbon See also Victor Mature Notes ;Citations ;References cited  *  External links  *Coast Guard Alaska News *National Trust Preservation online article about decommissioning the ship *Storis Museum, Juneau, AK *EN3 Tom Hough website Category:Medium endurance cutters Category:Icebreakers of the United States Coast Guard Category:1942 ships Category:National Register of Historic Places in Solano County, California Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in California ","title":"USCGC Storis (WMEC-38)"},{"id":"1490922","text":"Zak Benjamin Whitbread (born January 10, 1984) is an American-English professional footballer who plays as a defender. Early life Although born in Houston, Texas, United States, Whitbread has spent most of his life in England and Singapore. He has lived in Runcorn for the majority of his life, except for the five years he spent in Singapore when his father, Barry Whitbread, was the coach of the Singapore national football team during the late 1990s. While in Singapore, Whitbread attended St Stephen's School and then United World College of South East Asia. Club career=Liverpool While growing up in Runcorn, Whitbread was a fan of Manchester United, but because Liverpool was his father's team of choice, he joined the club's Centre of Excellence at the age of eight, and eventually worked his way through the Academy from under-15s through under-19s before joining the reserve team in 2003. His first match in a Liverpool jersey took place in 2003 in an exhibition match against Thailand during the club's Far East Tour. He came on to the pitch after the start of the second half, replacing Neil Mellor. Whitbread made his first team debut in the 2004‚Äì05 season, and played a number of games alongside Sami Hyypi√§ in Liverpool's 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Champions League qualification campaign. He spent much of the season on loan at Millwall. Millwall After signing for Millwall permanently on a three-year contract in June 2006, he featured frequently in the team's first eleven, starting 18 games for his new club in the 2006‚Äì07 season, before injuring himself in September 2006. The injury sidelined him for the rest of that season.Millwall FC Over the course of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Whitbread made 44 appearances, including the League One play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, which Millwall lost 3‚Äì2 to Scunthorpe United. Norwich City Whitbread signed for Norwich City on a -year contract on January 8, 2010, making his debut in the 5‚Äì0 win over Colchester United on January 16 as a substitute for Chris Martin, but featured little thereafter due to an injury. Whitbread was given squad number 6 ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 season, switching from 31. He played 3 games in pre- season 2010‚Äì11 before he sustained another injury, which ruled him out of the start of the new league season. Whitbread was expected to return to training near the time of the international break in September, however a further setback kept him out until the new Year. Whitbread returned to full training near Christmas 2010, along with Adam Drury. He made his long-awaited return from injury in a 4‚Äì2 win over Sheffield United on December 28, 2010, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for Anthony McNamee. He made his first start of the season in a 1‚Äì0 victory over league leaders Queens Park Rangers, helping Norwich to a first clean sheet in 10 games. Due to Leon Barnett's hamstring injury, Whitbread developed a centre back partnership with Elliott Ward. He scored his first goal for Norwich in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Hull City at the KC Stadium on March 19, 2011. Whitbread started in the Canaries' first game back in the Premier League, partnering Ritchie De Laet in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Wigan Athletic. However he picked up a knee injury in this match, meaning he was ruled out for the following match against Stoke City. He returned for the League Cup match against MK Dons, and started against Chelsea, but was withdrawn after 30 minutes with a suspected hamstring injury. Whitbread returned to training in November. He and Daniel Ayala got through a practice match, improving their fitness. Whitbread was back in the squad in early December. He made a return to the Norwich squad on December 3 against Manchester City, featuring as an unused substitute. In the next fixture against Newcastle United, Whitbread was given a start in a 4‚Äì2 win for Norwich, playing well apart from giving the ball away for Demba Ba's second goal. Whitbread kept his place for the following matches, performing admirably with Russell Martin in defence. He was partnered with Daniel Ayala from the New Year's Eve fixture against Fulham, and this partnership has seen Norwich win two consecutive away matches and three wins out of three in 2012. Whitbread was withdrawn early in the 2‚Äì0 victory over Bolton Wanderers, along with Daniel Ayala after complaining of a tight hamstring, 20 minutes after Ayala was subbed due to a suspect hamstring tear. He immediately regained his place upon his return to fitness, again at the expense of Leon Barnett in the narrow 2‚Äì1 defeat to Manchester United. He suffered a minor calf injury, before the 2‚Äì2 draw against Everton, causing manager Paul Lambert to withdraw him from the squad. He was eventually released by the club at the conclusion of the season. Leicester City On July 24, 2012, Whitbread signed a two- year contract with Championship side Leicester City on a free transfer following the end of his contract at Norwich. He made his debut on August 28, 2012 against Burton Albion in the League Cup. Whitbread scored his first goal for Leicester City, from a Martyn Waghorn corner, during a 4‚Äì1 win against local rivals Derby County on December 1, 2012. After which he was named in the Championship Team of the Week. He was released by Leicester on May 9, 2014. Derby County On September 29, 2013, Derby County announced that Whitbread had signed on a three-month loan deal. He scored on his debut in a 4‚Äì4 draw at home to Ipswich Town. At the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Whitbread was released by Leicester City. On June 25, 2014, Whitbread agreed a one-year deal to join Derby County on a permanent basis. Shrewsbury Town Following his release from Derby, Whitbread joined Shrewsbury Town in League One in October 2015, despite considering a move to the United States. Initially signing a short-term contract running until January 2016, he made his Shrewsbury debut in an unfamiliar midfield role, coming on as a substitute in a 2‚àí1 away defeat at Scunthorpe United. A week later, he made his first start for the club, playing the full ninety minutes of a 2‚àí0 home win over Bury. His contract was later extended to the end of the season, when he was subsequently released. International career Whitbread's opportunity came in August 2003 when he traveled to Spain to join the U.S. under 20s at the L'Alcudia International Tournament, where he started three of the five matches Thomas Rongen's squad played. Owing to his solid performance he was named in Rongen's side for the 2003 World Youth Championships in December. He started every match and scored his first goal for the U.S. to help the squad reach the Quarter Finals. His play led to his inclusion with the mostly Major League Soccer based side that unsuccessfully tried to qualify the U.S. for 2004 Summer Olympics. Unfortunately, he was only able to play in one match for Glenn Myernick due to an injury he suffered during training. He played for the United States under 20s team in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, and has since been promoted to the under 23 squad. On March 16, 2011, Whitbread was called into the United States camp for its friendlies against Argentina and Paraguay, but was unable to feature due to sustaining an injury while on club duty.Donovan and Dempsey headline US roster ‚Äì News  FOX Sports on MSN ReferencesExternal links * LFChistory.net player profile * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Houston Category:American soccer players Category:American expatriate soccer players Category:American people of English descent Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:American expatriate sportspeople in the United Kingdom Category:Soccer players from Texas Category:Association football defenders Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:United States men's under-20 international soccer players Category:People from Runcorn ","title":"Zak Whitbread"},{"id":"1490925","text":"Novelda (, ) is a town located in the province of Alicante, Spain. , it has a total population of 27,135 inhabitants.

While her early writings focused on the American South and those who live there, much of King's later work was published in National Review. Until her retirement in 2002, her column in National Review, \\"The Misanthrope's Corner\\", was known for \\"serving up a smorgasbord of curmudgeonly critiques about rubes and all else bothersome to the Queen of Mean\\", as the magazine put it. After leaving retirement in 2006, she began writing a new column for National Review entitled \\"The Bent Pin.\\" King was a traditionalist conservative, but not a \\"movement conservative,\\" and she objected to much of the populist direction of the contemporary American Right. She was an active Episcopalian (though she often referred to her agnosticism), a member of Phi Alpha Theta, and a monarchist. Early life King was born January 5, 1936 in Washington, D.C., to an American mother, Louise Cora (n√©e Ruding) King, and a British father, Herbert Frederick King. She grew up in the District with her parents, her maternal grandmother, and her grandmother's maid. Each of these people influenced her development as a person. In particular, her grandmother required high standards of behavior from her, referring to the family as descendants of Virginia's colonial elite. In many of her writings, King often referred to the comical contradictions between the material reality of her lower middle class upbringing and the snobbish behavior of her grandmother.King, Florence. Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady. New York: Stein and Day, 1985 (see chapters 1 and 2). In 1957, King received her BA in history from American University in Washington D.C., where she was inducted into Phi Alpha Theta. She attended the University of Mississippi as a graduate student, but did not complete her M.A. degree after discovering she could make a living as a writer. Career King had several occupations before she began writing as a career. In the mid-1950s, she was a history teacher in Suitland, Maryland. Later in the decade, she was a file clerk at the National Association of Realtors. From 1964 to 1967, King was a feature writer for the Raleigh News and Observer. While at the newspaper, King received the North Carolina Press Woman Award for reporting. The majority of King‚Äôs works under her own name have been non-fiction essays. She also wrote a historical romance novel, Barbarian Princess, under the pseudonym Laura Buchanan. King also admitted to having written numerous pornographic stories, pulp paperback books and erotica under various pseudonyms. She gained national attention with her column \\"The Misanthrope's Corner\\" in National Review, a conservative magazine of political and social commentary. She also wrote numerous articles for The American Enterprise. Her first book published under her own name was 1975's Southern Ladies and Gentlemen. The work provides a humorous guide to the South for \\"Yankees\\". Her most popular book, Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady (1985), is a semi-autobiographical work focusing on, among other things, her grandmother's attempts to mold King into a \\"Southern lady\\". In Confessions, King says she had relationships with both men and women during college: one woman she fell in love with was killed in a car crash. This relationship was detailed in Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady. She jokingly described herself as a \\"conservative lesbian feminist\\" and has been referred to as the \\"World's Funniest Bi-Sexual-Republican.\\" King later expressed regret at revealing her bisexuality, saying she did not want to be part of the \\"gay liberation movement\\" and embraced the concepts of \\"spinsterhood\\" and \\"the old maid.\\" In 1995, King publicly accused the writer Molly Ivins of plagiarizing her work. Ivins publicly acknowledged and apologized for her error in an exchange of letters in the next issue of that magazine, which may be found quoted in an account of the controversy.Molly Ivins apologizes to Florence King for inadvertent plagiarism, upenn.edu; accessed January 8, 2016.Florence King accuses Molly Ivins of plagiarism via google.com; accessed January 8, 2016.

Between 2003 and 2005, he was given credentials as a White House reporter. He was eventually employed by the conservative website Talon News during the latter part of this period. Gannon first gained national attention during a presidential press conference on January 26, 2005, when he asked United States President George W. Bush a question that some in the press corps considered \\"so friendly it might have been planted\\"Congresswoman Asks for Probe After 'Gannon' Quits WH Reporting Post (\\"How are you going to work with [Senate Democratic leaders] who seem to have divorced themselves from reality?\\"). Gannon routinely obtained daily passes to White House briefings, attending four Bush press conferences and appearing regularly at White House press briefings. Although he did not qualify for a Congressional press pass, Gannon was given daily passes to White House press briefings \\"after supplying his real name, date of birth and Social Security number.\\" Gannon came under public scrutiny for his lack of a journalistic background prior to his work with Talon and his involvement with various gay escort service websites using the professional name \\"Bulldog.\\" Gannon resigned from Talon News on February 8, 2005. Continuing to use the name Gannon, he has since created his own official homepage and worked for a time as a columnist for the Washington Blade newspaper, where he confirmed he was gay after he was outed.. \\"Rogers went farther: 'Are you a gay man?' 'Absolutely, but I'm not proud' Gannon said.\\" Most recently, Gannon operated JeffGannon.com, a blog where he criticized those who exposed him, the \\"Old Media\\" and the \\"Angry Gay Left\\", accusing them of promoting a double standard. The site has since been taken offline and the domain expired. He published a book titled The Great Media War in 2007. Media career=White House press credentials Gannon first attended a White House press conference on February 28, 2003, and there asked a question of then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. At this time Gannon had never had an article published, and was not associated with any kind of news organization (Talon News had not yet been created). However, Gannon states that he was editor of his high school student newspaper, as proof of having some journalistic experience. White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan later said that there had been no breakdown in security and no one had intervened on Gannon's behalf to ensure his access, despite the fact that he had been able to get a press pass for the White House using an assumed name. Gannon's response was that the alias Jeff Gannon was a professional name used for convenience, claiming that his \\"real last name is hard to spell and pronounce,\\" and that the Secret Service was aware of his identity. Journalists have said that it can take weeks to get the kind of clearance Gannon received. He was issued one-day press passes for nearly two years, avoiding the extensive background checks required for permanent passes, and sidestepping his inability to gain the necessary Congressional press pass. He applied for a Congressional press pass in April 2004 but was denied one by the Standing Committee of Correspondents, a group of congressional reporters who oversee press credential distribution on Capitol Hill, on the grounds that Talon did not qualify as a legitimate independent news service. On his resume Gannon said he is a graduate of the Leadership Institute Broadcast School of Journalism, a two-day seminar for \\"conservatives who want a career in journalism.\\" Talon News Talon News was a virtual organization (with no physical office or newsroom) owned by the Web site GOPUSA. Robert Eberle is the president and CEO of both GOPUSA and Talon News. This has led to unproven charges that Talon News was created specifically to give Gannon a news organization that he could ostensibly represent, to justify his continuing to work at the White House. By the middle of February 2005, the Talon News website had shut down indefinitely, according to the message on that site; since May 2007, the Talon News site has been a parody, and its pages link to The Firesign Theatre's site. Controversy The controversy over Gannon's background started after President George W. Bush's January 26, 2005, press conference, at which Gannon asked the president the following question: Gannon's question was ridiculed on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart enquiring, \\"Who is this muckraking Jeff Gannon, who is holding the president's feet to the fire so that he can more easily give him a reach- around?\\" The question was also derided by a number of bloggers who considered it an excessively deferential question for a reporter to ask at a presidential press conference. The question also contained a factually inaccurate assertion: the supposed comments about soup lines had not been made by Reid, but had been satirically attributed to him by conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. After the January 26, 2005, press conference, scrutiny into his personal and professional background by news organizations and blogs began. On February 8, 2005, Gannon resigned from Talon News and shut down his website, Jeffgannon.com. According to Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post: > Jeff Gannon, ... whose naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay > escort sites, says that he has 'regrets' about his past but that White House > officials knew nothing about his salacious activities. Gannon said that he has been stalked and that his family has been harassed. He has revived his website since that time. Gannon is alleged to have registered several Internet domain names, including hotmilitarystud.com and Militaryescorts4m.com and posted naked pictures of himself. According to The Independent: > Bloggers revealed that Jeff Gannon... had previously worked as a $200-an- > hour gay prostitute who advertised himself on a series of websites with > names such as hotmilitarystud.com. When these ads became public, Gannon refused to specifically address them, but admitted that he had made mistakes in his past. During the 2004 election, he wrote that John Kerry \\"might someday be known as 'the first gay president'\\" and that Kerry had supported \\"the pro-gay agenda.\\" Cliff Kincaid, editor of the conservative organization Accuracy in Media, wrote that \\"(t)he campaign against Gannon demonstrates the paranoid mentality and mean-spirited nature of the political left.\\" In April 2006, Gannon appeared on the television program Lie Detector, produced by Mark Phillips Philms and Telephision for the PAX Network (now Ion Television) submitting to and passing a polygraph test while asserting that he was not a White House operative. Connection to Plame investigation Gannon was questioned by the Justice Department in relation to the department's criminal investigation into the Valerie Plame affair, in which Plame's identity as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was leaked to a journalist by an administration official. On October 28, 2003, Talon News published an interview in three parts that Gannon had conducted with Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson, Plame's husband, whom the CIA had sent to Niger in 2003 to investigate claims that Iraq was attempting to procure yellowcake uranium. In the interview, Gannon asked Wilson about an \\"internal government memo prepared by U.S. intelligence personnel\\" that said Plame had suggested Wilson for the job. In a February 2005 interview, Gannon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had spoken to him in an effort to learn who had leaked the classified memo and to whom, but that he had not been asked to appear before the grand jury investigating the case. Many assumed the White House had leaked the memo to him. Gannon said he had learned about its existence after it had been mentioned in a story published in the Wall Street Journal. Previously, Gannon had been criticized by Tom Daschle's supporters when he covered the South Dakota Senate race between Daschle and John Thune. Supporters of Daschle claimed he acted as a de facto member of the Thune campaign while ostensibly a journalist. Washington Blade In July 2005, Gannon began writing for the DC-area gay publication Washington Blade. His articles included criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, who had accused him of having pornographic ads. Blade editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's criticism of the gay rights movement as well as his refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, \\"My personal life is a private matter, despite the fact that I have become a public person.\\" Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial, writing that the \\"steady stream of feedback/vitriol\\" had declined \\"a little\\" with each new Gannon article. Crain resigned as editor in 2006, retaining ownership in the paper's parent company. The new editorial team fired Gannon as a result of what editor Kevin Naff called Gannon's \\"huge credibility problem.\\" House Judiciary Committee The House Judiciary Committee voted against House resolution 136, on March 16, 2005, that would have directed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to transmit documents in the possession of officials to the House of Representatives. These documents related to the security investigations and background checks involved in granting Gannon access to the White House. The documents were to be transmitted no later than 14 days after the date of the adoption of the resolution. During the Committee meeting, Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee claimed that Gannon had engaged in \\"a penetration of the White House, maybe a security breach, and I do not believe it can be answered with self-investigation.House of Representatives security investigation\\"Scott Shepard, \\"House rejects probe of reporter's access\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 17, 2005. Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner said that a letter from the Secret Service dated March 7, 2005, stated, \\"Please be advised that our Office of Protective Operations has looked into this matter and has determined that there was no deviation from Secret Service standards and procedures as your letter suggests.\\" Gannon later wrote in his blog, \\"I hope this vote will put these issues to rest and allow me to return to my work as a journalist.\\" In his self-published book, The Great Media War, he responds to questions about whether he played some role for the Bush White House other than that of an independent journalist. White House records Democratic Representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Louise Slaughter of New York had submitted similar requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), on February 15, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security answered Slaughter's request with Secret Service records of Gannon's check in and out times at the White House. The Secret Service Records appear to show that he checked in, but never checked out on many occasions, and visited the White House on several days during which no press conference or other press events were held. In a 2005 interview, he stated that he has never spent the night at the White House.

Its specification is part of the family of Tactical Data Links. With Link 16, military aircraft as well as ships and ground forces may exchange their tactical picture in near- real time. Link 16 also supports the exchange of text messages, imagery data and provides two channels of digital voice (2.4 kbit/s and/or 16 kbit/s in any combination). Link 16 is defined as one of the digital services of the JTIDS / MIDS in NATO's Standardization Agreement STANAG 5516. MIL-STD-6016 is the related United States Department of Defense Link 16 MIL-STD.  Technical characteristics  Link 16 is a TDMA-based secure, jam-resistant, high-speed digital data link which operates in the radio frequency band 960‚Äì1,215 MHz, allocated in line with the ITU Radio Regulations to the aeronautical radionavigation service and to the radionavigation satellite service. This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of- sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and adhoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). It uses the transmission characteristics and protocols, conventions, and fixed-length or variable length message formats defined by MIL-STD 6016 and STANAG 5516 (formerly the JTIDS technical interface design plan). Information is typically passed at one of three data rates: 31.6, 57.6, or 115.2 kilobits per second, although the radios and waveform FHSS itself can support throughput values well over 1 Mbit/s. Link 16 information is primarily coded in J.-series messages which are binary data words with well-defined meanings. These data words are grouped in functional areas, and allocated to network participation groups (NPG) (virtual networks), most importantly: * PPLI, or Precise Participant Location and Identification (network participation groups 5 and 6), * Surveillance (network participation group 7), * Command (Mission Management/Weapons Coordination) (network participation group 8), * (Aircraft) Control (network participation group 9), * Electronic Warfare & Coordination (network participation group 10).

A takeover failed in 2003 and the company was declared bankrupt. A number of groups considered taking over Air Littoral including Azzurra Air (which shortly after ceased operations due to its own financial difficulties), but none succeeded and the airline was closed down by the French authorities in February 2004. Fleet and history In different periods of its history the company was operating the following aircraft:Klee, Ulrich & Bucher, Frank et al. jp airline-fleets international.

By the moment of bankruptcy Air Littoral had been operating a fleet of 17 CRJ-100s from bases in Nice, Montpellier, Paris (Orly) and Marseille, and was well known for the bright livery its aircraft sported in the years before its demise. In the 1990s, Air Littoral approached Metzler & Associ√©s of Paris for a new identity which would propel it into a new market, and that is what was delivered. However, the design, a mix-and-match collection of identity elements, was so innovative that the airline's executives were afraid to implement it - until they called a company-wide meeting and showed Air Littoral employees models of the aircraft painted in the vivid new style. Marc-Antoine Herrmann, creative director & lead designer for the project told airline officers, \\"We must show all the positive things associated with the south - its warmth, friendliness, joie de vivre. This is your difference, and you must use it so people will feel they take a part of the south with them when they go on-board.\\" To help the design team develop a palette and graphic approach unique to the south, mood boards were created displaying photos of the region and examples of its rich graphic heritage. \\\\- Taken from Step-by-Step Graphics magazine, circa 1993 Accidents * ReferencesExternal links * *Air Littoral - Airlines Remembered Category:Defunct airlines of France Category:Airlines established in 1972 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2004 Category:Former IATA members Category:French companies established in 1972 Category:French companies disestablished in 2004 ","title":"Air Littoral"},{"id":"1490987","text":"A millisecond pulsar (MSP) is a pulsar with a rotational period smaller than about 40 milliseconds. Millisecond pulsars have been detected in radio, X-ray, and gamma ray parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The leading theory for the origin of millisecond pulsars is that they are old, rapidly rotating neutron stars that have been spun up or \\"recycled\\" through accretion of matter from a companion star in a close binary system.Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel (1991), \\"Formation and evolution of binary and millisecond radio pulsars\\", Physics Reports 203, 1Tauris & van den Heuvel (2006), \\"Formation and evolution of compact stellar X-ray sources\\", In: Compact stellar X-ray sources. Edited by Walter Lewin & Michiel van der Klis. Cambridge Astrophysics Series, p.623-665, DOI: 10.2277/0521826594 For this reason, millisecond pulsars are sometimes called recycled pulsars. Millisecond pulsars are thought to be related to low-mass X-ray binary systems. It is thought that the X-rays in these systems are emitted by the accretion disk of a neutron star produced by the outer layers of a companion star that has overflowed its Roche lobe. The transfer of angular momentum from this accretion event can theoretically increase the rotation rate of the pulsar to hundreds of times per second, as is observed in millisecond pulsars. However, there has been recent evidence that the standard evolutionary model fails to explain the evolution of all millisecond pulsars, especially young millisecond pulsars with relatively high magnetic fields, e.g. PSR B1937+21. B√ºlent Kiziltan and S. E. Thorsett showed that different millisecond pulsars must form by at least two distinct processes. But the nature of the other process remains a mystery. The stellar grouping Terzan 5 Many millisecond pulsars are found in globular clusters. This is consistent with the spin-up theory of their formation, as the extremely high stellar density of these clusters implies a much higher likelihood of a pulsar having (or capturing) a giant companion star. Currently there are approximately 130 millisecond pulsars known in globular clusters. The globular cluster Terzan 5 alone contains 37 of these, followed by 47 Tucanae with 22 and M28 and M15 with 8 pulsars each. Millisecond pulsars, which can be timed with high precision, have a stability comparable to atomic- clock-based time standards when averaged over decades. This also makes them very sensitive probes of their environments. For example, anything placed in orbit around them causes periodic Doppler shifts in their pulses' arrival times on Earth, which can then be analyzed to reveal the presence of the companion and, with enough data, provide precise measurements of the orbit and the object's mass. The technique is so sensitive that even objects as small as asteroids can be detected if they happen to orbit a millisecond pulsar. The first confirmed exoplanets, discovered several years before the first detections of exoplanets around \\"normal\\" solar-like stars, were found in orbit around a millisecond pulsar, PSR B1257+12. These planets remained for many years the only Earth-mass objects known outside the Solar System. One of them, PSR B1257+12 D, has an even smaller mass, comparable to that of our Moon, and is still today the smallest-mass object known beyond the Solar System.  Pulsar rotational speed limits  The first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21, was discovered in 1982 by Backer et al. Spinning roughly 641 times per second, it remains the second fastest-spinning millisecond pulsar of the approximately 200 that have been discovered. Pulsar PSR J1748-2446ad, discovered in 2005, is, as of 2012, the fastest-spinning pulsar currently known, spinning 716 times per second. Current theories of neutron star structure and evolution predict that pulsars would break apart if they spun at a rate of c. 1500 rotations per second or more, and that at a rate of above about 1000 rotations per second they would lose energy by gravitational radiation faster than the accretion process would speed them up. However, in early 2007 data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and INTEGRAL spacecraft discovered a neutron star XTE J1739-285 rotating at 1122 Hz. The result is not statistically significant, with a significance level of only 3 sigma. Therefore, while it is an interesting candidate for further observations, current results are inconclusive. Still, it is believed that gravitational radiation plays a role in slowing the rate of rotation. Furthermore, one X-ray pulsar that spins at 599 revolutions per second, IGR J00291+5934, is a prime candidate for helping detect such waves in the future (most such X-ray pulsars only spin at around 300 rotations per second).

Forse, Early Theatre, Vol. 5, No. 2 (2002), 48. from 953 until his death and Duke of Lotharingia after 954. He was the brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Bruno was the youngest son of Henry the Fowler and his second wife Matilda. While he was still a child, it was decided that he should pursue a clerical career. In the early 940s he was educated in Trier by the leading scholar, Israel the Grammarian. In 951, Otto appointed Bruno as his archchaplain. Bruno soon received further advancement. In 953, the Archbishopric of Cologne fell vacant just when Conrad the Red, Duke of Lotharingia and Otto's son-in-law, had joined a rebellion against Otto. By appointing Bruno to the vacant position, Otto provided himself with a powerful ally against Conrad (much of Lotharingia fell under the archdiocese of Cologne) just when he needed one most. By the next year, the rebellion had collapsed. Otto deposed Conrad as Duke of Lotharingia and appointed Bruno in his place. Bruno was to be almost the last duke of the whole of Lotharingia: in 959 two local nobles, Godfrey and Frederick, were appointed as margraves of Lower Lotharingia and Upper Lotharingia respectively. Both margraves were recognised as dukes after Bruno's death. The two duchies would only be reunited between 1033 and 1044 under Gothelo I, Duke of Lotharingia. The combined positions of archbishop and duke -- or archduke, as his biographer Ruotger called him -- made Bruno the most powerful man after Otto not just in Germany but also beyond its borders. After the deaths of Louis IV of West Francia in 954 and Hugh the Great, his most powerful feudatory, in 956, Bruno, as brother-in-law to both of them and maternal uncle to their heirs Lothair, the new king, and Hugh Capet, acted as regent of west Francia. From 962 onwards, Bruno was also appointed as Otto's regent in Germany while Otto was absent in Italy. Bruno died in Reims in 965 and was buried in the monastery of St Pantaleon, which he had founded, just outside Cologne. Bruno's position in Cologne was little short of royal. Indeed, Otto delegated to Bruno and his successors as archbishop a number of normally royal privileges -- the right to build fortifications and set up markets, to strike coins and collect (and keep) such taxes as the special ones on Jews in return for royal protection, those on market trading and tolls from traffic along the Rhine. Even though Bruno's successors as archbishops would not be dukes as well, they would be the secular as well as the ecclesiastical rulers of Cologne until the battle of Worringen three centuries later. Bruno's court in Cologne was the main intellectual and artistic centre of its period in Germany -- far more so than that of his brother Otto, which was far more peripatetic and militarily oriented. Among others, Ratherius and Liutprand of Cremona spent time at the court. Many of the next generation of German ecclesiastical leaders were educated at Bruno's court, like Everaclus of Li√®ge, Gerard bishop of Toul, Wikfrid, bishop of Verdun, and Theoderic, bishop of Metz. Bruno's effect on medieval Cologne was immense. Apart from building a palace, he extended the cathedral to the point where it was regarded as rivalling St Peter's in Rome (this cathedral burned down in 1248 and was replaced by the current one). He brought the area between the old Roman walls and the Rhine within the city fortifications; and built new churches to Saint Martin of Tours within this area and to Saint Andrew just outside the northern city wall and a Benedictine monastery dedicated to St Pantaleon to the south-west of the city. Bruno translated St. Patroclus' relics from Troyes and buried them in 964 at St Patrokli Dom in Soest, where Patroclus is still today venerated.

He batted and threw right- handed. Necciai is best remembered for the unique feat of striking out 27 batters in a nine-inning game, which he accomplished in the Class-D Appalachian League on May 13, 1952. He is the only pitcher ever to do so in a nine-inning, professional-league game. Minor League career Necciai pitched two seasons of Class-D baseball before being drafted in the Pirates' farm system in 1952 at age 19. He was assigned to pitch for the Bristol Twins, the Pirates' Appalachian League team. On May 13, pitching despite painful stomach ulcers, Necciai struck out 27 batters while throwing a 7‚Äì0 no-hitter against the Welch Miners. Four of the Welch hitters did reach base, one runner each via a walk, an error, a hit batsman and a passed ball charged to Twins' catcher Harry Dunlop on a swinging third strike. This resulted in a four- strikeout ninth inning. Only two batters put the ball in play: Bob Ganung grounded out to first base in the fourth inning and Whitehead got on base on an error in the ninth. In his next start, Necciai threw a 24-strikeout two- hitter. In that season he struck out 109 hitters in 43 innings with Bristol, and a Carolina League-high 172 in 126 innings at Burlington before quickly climbing the ranks of the organization and eventually getting called up to the Major Leagues amid heavy publicity in August 1952. Major League career At 20 years old, Necciai posted a 1‚Äì6 record with 31 strikeouts and a 7.08 ERA in 54 innings pitched from August 10 to September 28, 1952, the single season composing his Major League career. Later years Necciai served a brief stint in the United States Armed Forces in 1953 before being released on a medical discharge. He returned to baseball thereafter, but was plagued by injuries resulting from his long-standing battle with stomach ulcers and further debilitation from a torn rotator cuff. He spent the years between 1953 and 1955 in various lower levels of professional baseball, but was ultimately unable to overcome injuries. He later began a successful career in the sporting goods industry.

It is the main feature of a show cave complex, which is claimed to be the largest in the UK and is a tourist attraction in Wales. The first section of the cave system is open to the public, but the extensive cave system beyond is scheduled as a national nature reserve and is open only to bona fide cavers. The bones of some 42 humans, as well as numerous animal bones, have been found in one of the nearby chambers of this cave system. In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, Dan yr Ogof was named as the greatest natural wonder in Britain. Exploration Roundhouses at Dan yr Ogof Dinosaur exhibition at Dan yr Ogof The cave was first explored in 1912 by three local brothers, Edwin, Tommy and Jeff Morgan, using candles and primitive equipment. Completely unsure of what they would discover, they armed themselves with a revolver. Edwin was the first to enter, as he was the smallest of the Morgan brothers. Initial expedition was halted at a large lake, which they later managed to cross by coracle. They eventually crossed three more lakes in the same manner, but were stopped by a tight crawl. This squeeze, known as the Long Crawl, was first passed by Eileen Davies, a member of the South Wales Caving Club in 1963. The initials 'PO' were found by Eileen Davies at the pitch to Gerard Platten Hall. Peter Ogden had not descended the pitch due to lack of the required equipment and was prevented from returning by an extended period of bad weather. Exploration has been steadily continued by later cavers who have extended the cave to its present length. Some of this length was reached by cave diving. One of these explorers was Martyn Farr, who wrote a book about the system in which he claims that the system will eventually be extended to at least .

It has been restored and is open to guided tours. History The original castle was built in 1467 by Se√°n Mac Conmara (anglicised as MacNamara), son of S√≠oda Mac Conmara, and is a good example of a late medieval tower house. The castle's name translates as \\"castle of the place abounding in little hills\\". In 1571, the castle became the seat of the MacNamara (Mac Conmara) sept, the Earls of West Clancullen. Donnchadh Mac Conmara was a leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and Knappogue remained in MacNamara hands throughout the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649‚Äì53) it was confiscated in accord with the Adventurers' Act and its new owner was a roundhead, Arthur Smith. Arthur Smith occupied the castle from 1659 to 1661. After the monarchy was restored in 1660, Knappogue was returned to its MacNamara owners. Eventually, Francis MacNamara, High Sheriff of Clare in 1789, sold the castle to the Scott family of Cahircon in 1800; the latter carried out major restoration and extension work. In 1837, the castle was owned by William Scott. In 1855, the castle was acquired by Theobold Fitzwalter Butler, 14th Baron Dunboyne. It became the family seat of the Dunboyne family. They continued the restoration work of the Scotts, adding a drawing-room, the long room and a west wing, including the clock tower and the gateway. The remodelling was done by architects James Pain and his brother George Richard Pain. During the War of Independence (1919‚Äì21), Clare County Council held their meetings at Knappogue Castle where they were guarded by the East Clare Flying Column. Michael Brennan, Commander of the East Clare Brigade also used the castle as his headquarters during that time.Framed and Glazed photograph, East Clare Brigade In 1927, Knappogue demesne was purchased by the Irish Land Commission and the castle became the possession of the Quinn family . The castle and lands were then purchased in 1966 by Mark Edwin Andrews, former Assistant Secretary of the United States Navy, from Houston, Texas. He and his wife Lavonne (a prominent American architect), in collaboration with what was then Shannon Free Airport Development Company (today Shannon Heritage) and Bord F√°ilte √âireann carried out an extensive restoration around 1969. This was intended to accommodate use of the castle as restaurant and private residence. Their work returned much of the castle to its former 15th century state while encompassing and retaining later additions that chronicle the continuous occupation of the castle. The Andrews later leased part of the castle to the Irish Government as a cultural and tourist facility for a nominal rent. Today Shannon Development purchased the castle in 1996. Today, the castle is used as a venue for weddings and medieval banquets and offers guided tours. Dating from 1817, the garden is now restored to its former state. The walls of the garden have been refurnished with climbing roses, grapevines and many varieties of clematis. There is also a whiskey named \\"Knappogue Castle\\" produced by the Castle Brands company, currently bottling liquor produced by Bushmills.

He is the founder, former CEO and editor-in-chief of an early web magazine, Salon. Talbot founded Salon in 1995. The magazine gained a large following and broke several major national stories. It was described by Entertainment Weekly as one of the Net's \\"few genuine must-reads\\". Since leaving Salon, Talbot has researched and written on the Kennedy assassination and other areas of what he calls \\"hidden history.\\" Talbot has worked as a senior editor for Mother Jones magazine and a features editor for The San Francisco Examiner, and has written for Time magazine, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, and other publications. Early life and career Talbot was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He attended Harvard Boys School but did not graduate after falling afoul of the school's headmaster and ROTC program during the Vietnam War. After graduating from the University of California at Santa Cruz, he returned to Los Angeles, where he co-wrote with Barbara Zheutlin a history of the Hollywood Left, \\"Creative Differences\\", and freelanced for Crawdaddy, Rolling Stone, and other magazines. He later was hired by Environmental Action Foundation in Washington, D.C. to write \\"Power and Light,\\" a book about the politics of energy. After he returned to California, he worked as an editor at Mother Jones magazine before San Francisco Examiner publisher Will Hearst hired him to edit the newspaper's Sunday magazine, Image. It was at the Examiner where Talbot developed the idea for Salon, convincing several of his newspaper colleagues to join him. Salon Salon is a web magazine based in San Francisco. Talbot has characterized Salon as aiming to be a \\"smart tabloid.\\" In 1996, Time magazine picked Salon as the web site of the year. Originally created to cover books and popular culture, the web site became increasingly politicized during the Clinton impeachment drama in the late 1990s. Salon broke from the mainstream press by defending the Clinton presidency and investigating the right-wing prosecutorial apparatus headed by Kenneth Starr and Rep. Henry Hyde, whose own infidelity Salon exposed. Before stepping down as Salon's CEO and editor-in- chief in 2005, Talbot stabilized the financially rocky web enterprise. Talbot returned briefly as Salon CEO in 2011 but has since left the company. The Talbot Players In 2008, Talbot launched a media production company with his siblings called The Talbot Players, named after their late father's theater troupe. The company produced books, films and documentaries. In addition to the Pulp History series for Simon & Schuster, the company developed a documentary TV series about global music for PBS called \\"Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders\\". Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years After leaving Salon, Talbot resumed his career as an author of popular history books. Talbot's book, The New York Times bestseller, Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years, offers a potentially controversial view of the Kennedy presidency and assassination, and explores Bobby Kennedy's search for the truth about his brother's murder. Talbot is now working on a feature documentary based on Brothers. Devil Dog Talbot's book Devil Dog: The Amazing True Story of the Man Who Saved America chronicles the life and exploits of antiwar U.S. Marine General Smedley Darlington Butler. The book, which was part of an illustrated history series called Pulp History, is a collaboration with Zap Comix artist Spain Rodriguez. Devil Dog, which was published by Simon & Schuster in fall 2010, won praise from The New York Times, which called the Pulp History series \\"rip-roaring nonfiction tales with enough purple prose, gory illustrations and va-va-va-voom women to lure in even reluctant teenage male readers\\". Season of the Witch Talbot's book Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror, and Deliverance in the City of Love, about the wild and bloody birth of \\"San Francisco values\\", was published in spring 2012. Season of the Witch received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews, and was described as \\"enthralling, news-driven history\\" (San Francisco Chronicle), \\"energetic, highly entertaining storytelling\\" (Boston Globe), and \\"an enthralling ‚Äì and harrowing ‚Äì account of how the 1967 Summer of Love gave way to 20 or so winters of discontent\\" (Washington Post). The Devil's Chessboard Talbot's book The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government is a biography examining the career of Allen Dulles. According to Talbot, Dulles orchestrated the assassination of Kennedy at the behest of corporate leaders who perceived the President to be threat to national security, lobbied Lyndon B. Johnson to have himself appointed to the Warren Commission, then arranged to have Lee Harvey Oswald take sole responsibility for the act. The book charges that the conspirators in JFK's death also murdered Bobby Kennedy as they perceived him to be \\"a wild card, an uncontrollable threat\\" that would reveal the plot. The book has stirred debate about the history of the CIA. In a review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Glenn C. Altschuler stated, \\"Talbot‚Äôs indictment is long, varied and sensational.\\" Altschuler wrote: \\"Animated by conspiracy theories, the speculations and accusations in his book often run far ahead of the evidence, even for those of us inclined to believe the worst about Allen Dulles.\\" But the book was praised elsewhere, including Kirkus Reviews, whose starred review, called it \\"a frightening biography of power, manipulation and outright treason. [...] all engaged American citizens should read this book and have their eyes opened.\\" Between Heaven and Hell: The Story of My Stroke  In November 2017, Talbot suffered an ischemic stroke. In January 2020, his book about the stroke and his recovery from it, Between Heaven and Hell: The Story of My Stroke, was published. Other ventures In 2015, Talbot was announced as the editor of Hot Books, a new nonfiction imprint of Skyhorse Publishing. In 2016, Talbot became a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.

In modern Welsh the word is used for any soup or broth; in English it refers to a traditional Welsh soup, usually called cawl Cymreig in Welsh. Historically, ingredients tended to vary, but the most common recipes are with lamb or beef with leeks, potatoes, swedes, carrots and other seasonal vegetables. Cawl is recognised as a national dish of Wales. History With recipes dating back to the fourteenth century, cawl is widely considered to be the national dish of Wales. Cawl was traditionally eaten during the winter months in the south-west of Wales.Davies, (2008) p.130 Today, the word is often used to refer to a dish containing lamb and leeks, due to their association with Welsh culture, but historically it was made with either salted bacon or beef, along with swedes, carrots and other seasonal vegetables. With the introduction of the potato into the European diet in the latter half of the 16th century, it became a core ingredient in the recipe as well. The meat in the dish was normally cut into medium-sized pieces and simmered with the vegetables in water. The stock was thickened with either oatmeal or flour, and was then served, without the meat or vegetables, as a first course. The vegetables and slices of the meat would then be served as a second course. Cawl served as a single course is today the most popular way to serve the meal, which is similar to its north Wales equivalent lobsgows. Lobsgows differs in that the meat and vegetables were cut into smaller pieces and the stock was not thickened. \\"Cawl cennin\\", or leek cawl, can be made without meat but using meat stock. In some areas cawl is often served with bread and cheese. These are served separately on a plate. The dish was traditionally cooked in an iron pot or cauldron over the fire and eaten with wooden spoons.Freeman (1980) p.82 The Welsh phrase gwneud cawl o [rywbeth] (literally \\"(to) make a cawl of [something]\\") means 'to mess something up'. Etymology The word cawl in Welsh is first recorded in the 14th century, and is thought to come from the Latin caulis, meaning the stalk of a plant, a cabbage stalk or a cabbage. An alternative suggestion is that it is from Latin calidus, meaning warm, as this is the source of Spanish caldo, with the senses of broth or gravy.

He was a member of the Yasuda clan.Morikawa, Hidemasa. (2001). A History of Top Management in Japan: Managerial Enterprises and Family Enterprises, p. 61. Zenjir≈ç moved to Edo at the age of 17 and began working in a money changing house. In 1863, he started providing tax-farming services to the Tokugawa Shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, he provided the same services to the new Meiji government. Yasuda profited from the delay between the collection of taxes and their forwarding to the government. He greatly magnified his wealth by buying up depreciated Meiji paper money that the government subsequently exchanged for gold. Yasuda helped establish the Third National Bank in 1876. Later, in 1880, Yasuda set up the Yasuda Bank (later the Fuji Bank, now Mizuho Financial Group) and the Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Company (later merged to form Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance), which he organized into a zaibatsu holding company. In 1893, the Yasuda zaibatsu absorbed the Tokyo Fire Insurance Company (renamed the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company, now Sompo Japan Insurance). Yasuda was among the best financiers that Japan had; however he was not adventurous and hardly expanded the business beyond finance. Most of the industrial houses associated with Yasuda were actually those that Asano Soichiro (the founder of the Asano zaibatsu) started, whom Yasuda trusted and provided loans to. More accurately, therefore, they belonged to Asano zaibatsu and were merely affiliated to Yasuda Zaibatsu. In his later years, he donated the Yasuda Auditorium to the Tokyo Imperial University and the Hibiya Kokaido hall. Yasuda was assassinated in 1921 by a nationalist lawyer named Asahi Heigo, because Yasuda had refused to make a financial donation to a worker's hotel. Yasuda was the maternal great-grandfather of avant-garde artist and singer Yoko Ono, the widow of musician John Lennon. Lennon, on seeing Yasuda's photograph for the first time, is alleged to have said 'That's me in a former life', to which Ono replied 'Don't say that. He was assassinated.' Lennon himself was later shot and killed in 1980.

It is located at the northwest part of Alicante, and borders to the west with Castilla-La Mancha and Murcia, to the north with the province of Valencia and to the east and south with the province of Alicante. It is the capital of the comarca of the Alto Vinalop√≥. The municipality has an area of 345.6 km¬≤ and a population of 34,928 inhabitants as of INE 2008. There is evidence of settlement in the area from Middle Paleolithic. However, it is on dispute if the current city dates from visigothic times or before, though certainly it existed in the 11th century, during the Muslim period. After the Christian conquest, it became Seigneury, Principality, Duchy and finally Marquisate, until the people, encouraged by the Catholic Monarchs, revolted against the marquis. In 1525 Charles V conceded the title of City to Villena. This is the most economically prosperous period, as shown by the monuments that survived to nowadays. Although a railway station was inaugurated in 1858, economy kept being mainly agricultural until the rural exode that took place in the 1960s. Then, the economic model changed rapidly so that currently economy is based mainly on tertiary sector and industry, chiefly footwear, construction and furniture. The historical city and surroundings contain an important group of historical remains, including two castles and several churches, hermitages, palaces and squares, as well as a number of museums, standing out the Archaeological Museum \\"Jos√© Mar√≠a Soler\\". Among the main cultural events are the Moors and Christians festival and the Concurso de J√≥venes Int√©rpretes \\"Ruperto Chap√≠\\" (Young Interpreters Contest). Toponymy The first known name of the area is Ad Turres, which appears in the Vascula Apollinaria and has been identified with some of the Roman villas or postae in the Via Augusta itinerary, at some point between Villena and Font de la Figuera. Near the latter there is evidence of an old Tower already ruined by the 14th century. As for the origin of the term Villena, there is some polemic. Men√©ndez Pidal proposed an evolution from a hypothetic antroponym Bellius or Vellius and the sufix -ana, as in Lucena (Lucius + -ana) or Maracena (Marcus + -ana), which would give the Roman word Belliana or Velliana. However, Belliana or Bellius have not been documented in Roman times, as well as the evolution from Belliana to Villena involves several phonetic difficulties. So, Domene Verd√∫ indicates that the origin of the toponym would be the term BilyƒÅna, purely Arabic, meaning \\"the filled (by Allah)\\". This Arabic term, documented from the 11th century on, evolved in two ways. On the one hand, following the rules of Medieval Spanish, to Belliena, as is written in the Historia Roderici (around 1180). On the other hand, Belliena was replaced by the Aragonese term Billena after the Christian conquest, which was carried out mostly by Aragonese and Catalan. The current spelling was consolidated around the 15th century, since Spanish had totally lost the distinction between [b] and [v] and writing was attracted by the word villa, meaning \\"town\\". Symbols The coat of arms of Villena has been used traditionally since at least 1477, but has never been made official. The castle in the first quarter comes from the symbol of the Crown of Castile, whereas the lion in the second quarter and the winged hand in the third are legacy of don Juan Manuel, second lord of the city. The three pinetrees and the pond in the fourth quarter refer to the Lagoon of Villena or the Fuente del Chopo, formerly big wealth sources for the city; the first as a salt evaporation pond and the second as a source of fresh water. The crown is a symbol of the marquisate of Villena. As the coat of arms has never made official, there are different versions according to the City Hall's terms of office, as well as certain polemic about the position of the second and third quarter. Physical geography Villena is placed northwest in the province of Alicante, in the comarca of Alto Vinalop√≥. It is in the middle of an important crossroad which links the Valencian Community, the Region of Murcia and Castile-La Mancha, in a natural corridor known as Villena's Corridor or Vinalop√≥'s Corridor, since the river Vinalop√≥ flows through the municipal term of Villena. This corridor has been of capital importance since prehistoric times (this is the place where the Via Augusta led first into the Meseta Central), and, being at the middle of towns as Biar, Sax, Font de la Figuera, Yecla or Caudete made Villena an important transports junction. Villena's municipality, having an area of 345,6 km2 in the second widest in the province of Alicante. Salvatierra castle ruins.  History  Don Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena Villena region played an important role during the Bronze Age, and in the development of early metallurgy. Cabezo Redondo is an important archaeological site of the Bronze Age located on a hill 2 km from the town of Villena. It was a regional center inhabited between 1500 and 1100 BC, and probably belonged to Argaric culture. After the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula the city was called Medina Bilyana and was one of the seven cities mentioned in the Treaty of Tudmir. Calatrava knights reconquered the city by the king James I of Aragon. This caused some tensions between Castile and Aragon, since Villena should have been reserved to Castile under the treaties of Tudil√©n and Cazorla, so both crowns had to sign news treaties: The Treaty of Almizra, Torrellas and Elche. After the Christian conquest, Villena becomes the capital of an important seigneury, later duchy, principality and marquisate, until the popular rebellion against the Marquis, instigated by the Catholic Monarchs. Ancient gold hoards Treasure of Villena, the second biggest gold find in Europe The Cabezo Redondo gold hoard was an important archaeological find. It was made by the Spanish archaeologist Jos√© Mar√≠a Soler Garc√≠a. The treasure was found in 1959, and contains 35 items of jewelry, including a tiara, finger rings, bracelets, and pendants. Treasure of Villena, another find that is much bigger, was also hidden in the Cabezo Redondo area, near Villena, by its ancient inhabitants.Decreto 66/2005, de 1 de abril, por el que se declara Bien de Inter√©s Cultural la Colecci√≥n Arqueol√≥gica del Tesoro de Villena This was also found, in 1963, by Jos√© Mar√≠a Soler Garc√≠a. It is the most important ancient treasure find in the Iberian Peninsula and the second one in Europe, just behind that from the Royal Graves in Mycenae, Greece. This find was not made at Cabezo Redondo, itself, but at the Rambla del Panadero, 5 km east of Villena. Nevertheless, it is believed that, based on its resemblance to the previous Cabezo Redondo hoard, the trove was buried by the ancient inhabitants of Cabezo Redondo.

A flavoprotein is a protein that contains a flavin group, which may be in the form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Many flavoproteins are known: components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. FAD can exist in four redox states, which are the flavin-N(5)-oxide, quinone, semiquinone, and hydroquinone. FAD is converted between these states by accepting or donating electrons. FAD, in its fully oxidized form, or quinone form, accepts two electrons and two protons to become FADH2 (hydroquinone form). The semiquinone (FADH¬∑) can be formed by either reduction of FAD or oxidation of FADH2 by accepting or donating one electron and one proton, respectively. Some proteins, however, generate and maintain a superoxidized form of the flavin cofactor, the flavin-N(5)-oxide.  History  Flavoproteins were first discovered in 1879 by separating components of cow's milk. They were initially called lactochrome due to their milky origin and yellow pigment. It took 50 years for the scientific community to make any substantial progress in identifying the molecules responsible for the yellow pigment. The 1930s launched the field of coenzyme research with the publication of many flavin and nicotinamide derivative structures and their obligate roles in redox catalysis. German scientists Otto Warburg and Walter Christian discovered a yeast derived yellow protein required for cellular respiration in 1932. Their colleague Hugo Theorell separated this yellow enzyme into apoenzyme and yellow pigment, and showed that neither the enzyme nor the pigment was capable of oxidizing NADH on their own, but mixing them together would restore activity. Theorell confirmed the pigment to be riboflavin's phosphate ester, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in 1937, which was the first direct evidence for enzyme cofactors. Warburg and Christian then found FAD to be a cofactor of D-amino acid oxidase through similar experiments in 1938. Warburg's work with linking nicotinamide to hydride transfers and the discovery of flavins paved the way for many scientists in the 40s and 50s to discover copious amounts of redox biochemistry and link them together in pathways such as the citric acid cycle and ATP synthesis.  Properties  Flavin adenine dinucleotide consists of two main portions: an adenine nucleotide (adenosine monophosphate) and a flavin mononucleotide bridged together through their phosphate groups. Adenine is bound to a cyclic ribose at the 1' carbon, while phosphate is bound to the ribose at the 5' carbon to form the adenine nucledotide. Riboflavin is formed by a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond between an isoalloxazine and a ribitol. The phosphate group is then bound to the on the terminal ribose carbon to form a FMN. Because the bond between the isoalloxazine and the ribitol is not considered to be a glycosidic bond, the flavin mononucleotide is not truly a nucleotide. This makes the dinucleotide name misleading; however, the flavin mononucleotide group is still very close to a nucleotide in its structure and chemical properties. Reaction of FAD to form FADH2 Approximate absorption spectrum for FAD FAD can be reduced to FADH2 through the addition of 2 H+ and 2 e‚àí. FADH2 can also be oxidized by the loss of 1 H+ and 1 e‚àí to form FADH. The FAD form can be recreated through the further loss of 1 H+ and 1 e‚àí. FAD formation can also occur through the reduction and dehydration of flavin-N(5)-oxide. Based on the oxidation state, flavins take specific colors when in aqueous solution. flavin-N(5)-oxide (superoxidized) is yellow-orange, FAD (fully oxidized) is yellow, FADH (half reduced) is either blue or red based on the pH, and the fully reduced form is colorless. Changing the form can have a large impact on other chemical properties. For example, FAD, the fully oxidized form is subject to nucleophilic attack, the fully reduced form, FADH2 has high polarizability, while the half reduced form is unstable in aqueous solution. FAD is an aromatic ring system, whereas FADH2 is not. This means that FADH2 is significantly higher in energy, without the stabilization through resonance that the aromatic structure provides. FADH2 is an energy-carrying molecule, because, once oxidized it regains aromaticity and releases the energy represented by this stabilization. The spectroscopic properties of FAD and its variants allows for reaction monitoring by use of UV-VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Each form of FAD has distinct absorbance spectra, making for easy observation of changes in oxidation state. A major local absorbance maximum for FAD is observed at 450 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 11,300. Flavins in general have fluorescent activity when unbound (proteins bound to flavin nucleic acid derivatives are called flavoproteins). This property can be utilized when examining protein binding, observing loss of fluorescent activity when put into the bound state. Oxidized flavins have high absorbances of about 450 nm, and fluoresce at about 515-520 nm.  Chemical states  In biological systems, FAD acts as an acceptor of H+ and e‚àí in its fully oxidized form, an acceptor or donor in the FADH form, and a donor in the reduced FADH2 form. The diagram below summarizes the potential changes that it can undergo. :422px Along with what is seen above, other reactive forms of FAD can be formed and consumed. These reactions involve the transfer of electrons and the making/breaking of chemical bonds. Through reaction mechanisms, FAD is able to contribute to chemical activities within biological systems. The following pictures depict general forms of some of the actions that FAD can be involved in. Mechanisms 1 and 2 represent hydride gain, in which the molecule gains what amounts to be one hydride ion. Mechanisms 3 and 4 radical formation and hydride loss. Radical species contain unpaired electron atoms and are very chemically active. Hydride loss is the inverse process of the hydride gain seen before. The final two mechanisms show nucleophilic addition and a reaction using a carbon radical. Mechanism 1. Hydride transfer occurs by addition of H+ and 2 e‚àí Mechanism 2. Hydride transfer by abstraction of hydride from NADH Mechanism 3. Radical formation by electron abstraction Mechanism 4. The loss of hydride to electron deficient R group Mechanism 5. Use of nucleophilic addition to break R1-R2 bond Mechanism 6. Carbon radical reacts with O2 and acid to form H2O2  Biosynthesis  FAD plays a major role as an enzyme cofactor along with flavin mononucleotide, another molecule originating from riboflavin. Bacteria, fungi and plants can produce riboflavin, but other eukaryotes, such as humans, have lost the ability to make it. Therefore, humans must obtain riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, from dietary sources. Riboflavin is generally ingested in the small intestine and then transported to cells via carrier proteins. Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) adds a phosphate group to riboflavin to produce flavin mononucleotide, and then FAD synthetase attaches an adenine nucleotide; both steps require ATP. Bacteria generally have one bi-functional enzyme, but archaea and eukaryotes usually employ two distinct enzymes. Current research indicates that distinct isoforms exist in the cytosol and mitochondria. It seems that FAD is synthesized in both locations and potentially transported where needed. :250px  Function  Flavoproteins utilize the unique and versatile structure of flavin moieties to catalyze difficult redox reactions. Since flavins have multiple redox states they can participate in processes that involve the transfer of either one or two electrons, hydrogen atoms, or hydronium ions. The N5 and C4a of the fully oxidized flavin ring are also susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This wide variety of ionization and modification of the flavin moiety can be attributed to the isoalloxazine ring system and the ability of flavoproteins to drastically perturb the kinetic parameters of flavins upon binding, including flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the genome (the flavoproteome) is species dependent and can range from 0.1% - 3.5%, with humans having 90 flavoprotein encoded genes. FAD is the more complex and abundant form of flavin and is reported to bind to 75% of the total flavoproteome and 84% of human encoded flavoproteins. Cellular concentrations of free or non-covalently bound flavins in a variety of cultured mammalian cell lines were reported for FAD (2.2-17.0 amol/cell) and FMN (0.46-3.4 amol/cell). FAD has a more positive reduction potential than NAD+ and is a very strong oxidizing agent. The cell utilizes this in many energetically difficult oxidation reactions such as dehydrogenation of a C-C bond to an alkene. FAD-dependent proteins function in a large variety of metabolic pathways including electron transport, DNA repair, nucleotide biosynthesis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, amino acid catabolism, as well as synthesis of other cofactors such as CoA, CoQ and heme groups. One well-known reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (also known as the TCA or Krebs cycle); succinate dehydrogenase (complex II in the electron transport chain) requires covalently bound FAD to catalyze the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by coupling it with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. The high-energy electrons from this oxidation are stored momentarily by reducing FAD to FADH2. FADH2 then reverts to FAD, sending its two high-energy electrons through the electron transport chain; the energy in FADH2 is enough to produce 1.5 equivalents of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Some redox flavoproteins non- covalently bind to FAD like Acetyl-CoA-dehydrogenases which are involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids like leucine (isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase), isoleucine, (short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), valine (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), and lysine (glutaryl- CoA dehydrogenase). Additional examples of FAD-dependent enzymes that regulate metabolism are glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (triglyceride synthesis) and xanthine oxidase involved in purine nucleotide catabolism. Noncatalytic functions that FAD can play in flavoproteins include as structural roles, or involved in blue-sensitive light photoreceptors that regulate biological clocks and development, generation of light in bioluminescent bacteria.  Flavoproteins  Flavoproteins have either an FMN or FAD molecule as a prosthetic group, this prosthetic group can be tightly bound or covalently linked. Only about 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD, but these enzymes have stronger redox power. In some instances, FAD can provide structural support for active sites or provide stabilization of intermediates during catalysis. Based on the available structural data, the known FAD- binding sites can be divided into more than 200 types. 90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome; about 84% require FAD, and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both to be present. Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria because of their redox power. Of all flavoproteins, 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases.  Oxidation of carbon-heteroatom bonds  Carbon-nitrogen = Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an extensively studied flavoenzyme due to its biological importance with the catabolism of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. MAO oxidizes primary, secondary and tertiary amines, which nonenzymatically hydrolyze from the imine to aldehyde or ketone. Even though this class of enzyme has been extensively studied, its mechanism of action is still being debated. Two mechanisms have been proposed: a radical mechanism and a nucleophilic mechanism. The radical mechanism is less generally accepted because no spectral or electron paramagnetic resonance evidence exists for the presence of a radical intermediate. The nucleophilic mechanism is more favored because it is supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies which mutated two tyrosine residues that were expected to increase the nucleophilicity of the substrates. :700px = Carbon-oxygen = Glucose oxidase (GOX) catalyzes the oxidation of Œ≤-D-glucose to D-glucono-Œ¥-lactone with the simultaneous reduction of enzyme-bound flavin. GOX exists as a homodimer, with each subunit binding one FAD molecule. Crystal structures show that FAD binds in a deep pocket of the enzyme near the dimer interface. Studies showed that upon replacement of FAD with 8-hydroxy-5-carba-5-deaza FAD, the stereochemistry of the reaction was determined by reacting with the re face of the flavin. During turnover, the neutral and anionic semiquinones are observed which indicates a radical mechanism. :325px = Carbon-sulfur = Prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase) catalyzes the cleavage of prenylcysteine (a protein modification) to form an isoprenoid aldehyde and the freed cysteine residue on the protein target. The FAD is non-covalently bound to PCLase. Not many mechanistic studies have been done looking at the reactions of the flavin, but the proposed mechanism is shown below. A hydride transfer from the C1 of the prenyl moiety to FAD is proposed, resulting in the reduction of the flavin to FADH2. COformED IS a carbocation that is stabilized by the neighboring sulfur atom. FADH2 then reacts with molecular oxygen to restore the oxidized enzyme. :650px  Carbon-carbon  UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine Reductase (MurB) is an enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (substrate) to the corresponding D-lactyl compound UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (product). MurB is a monomer and contains one FAD molecule. Before the substrate can be converted to product, NADPH must first reduce FAD. Once NADP+ dissociates, the substrate can bind and the reduced flavin can reduce the product. :700px  Thiol/disulfide chemistry  Glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH). GR requires FAD and NADPH to facilitate this reaction; first a hydride must be transferred from NADPH to FAD. The reduced flavin can then act as a nucleophile to attack the disulfide, this forms the C4a-cysteine adduct. Elimination of this adduct results in a flavin-thiolate charge-transfer complex. :800px  Electron transfer reactions  Cytochrome P450 type enzymes that catalyze monooxygenase (hydroxylation) reactions are dependent on the transfer of two electrons from FAD to the P450. Two types of P450 systems are found in eukaryotes. The P450 systems that are located in the endoplasmic reticulum are dependent on a cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR) that contains both an FAD and an FMN. The two electrons on reduced FAD (FADH2) are transferred one at a time to FMN and then a single electron is passed from FMN to the heme of the P450. The P450 systems that are located in the mitochondria are dependent on two electron transfer proteins: An FAD containing adrenodoxin reductase (AR) and a small iron-sulfur group containing protein named adrenodoxin. FAD is embedded in the FAD-binding domain of AR. The FAD of AR is reduced to FADH2 by transfer of two electrons from NADPH that binds in the NADP-binding domain of AR. The structure of this enzyme is highly conserved to maintain precisely the alignment of electron donor NADPH and acceptor FAD for efficient electron transfer. The two electrons in reduced FAD are transferred one a time to adrenodoxin which in turn donates the single electron to the heme group of the mitochondrial P450. The structures of the reductase of the microsomal versus reductase of the mitochondrial P450 systems are completely different and show no homology.  Redox  p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) catalyzes the oxygenation of p-hydroxybenzoate (pOHB) to 3,4-dihyroxybenzoate (3,4-diOHB); FAD, NADPH and molecular oxygen are all required for this reaction. NADPH first transfers a hydride equivalent to FAD, creating FADH‚àí, and then NADP+ dissociates from the enzyme. Reduced PHBH then reacts with molecular oxygen to form the flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide. The flavin hydroperoxide quickly hydroxylates pOHB, and then eliminates water to regenerate oxidized flavin. An alternative flavin-mediated oxygenation mechanism involves the use of a flavin-N(5)-oxide rather than a flavin-C(4a)-(hydro)peroxide. :700px  Nonredox  Chorismate synthase (CS) catalyzes the last step in the shikimate pathway‚Äîthe formation of chorismate. Two classes of CS are known, both of which require FMN, but are divided on their need for NADPH as a reducing agent. The proposed mechanism for CS involves radical species. The radical flavin species has not been detected spectroscopically without using a substrate analogue, which suggests that it is short-lived. However, when using a fluorinated substrate, a neutral flavin semiquinone was detected. :850px  Complex flavoenzymes  Glutamate synthase catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate into L-glutamate with L-glutamine serving as the nitrogen source for the reaction. All glutamate syntheses are iron-sulfur flavoproteins containing an iron-sulfur cluster and FMN. The three classes of glutamate syntheses are categorized based on their sequences and biochemical properties. Even though there are three classes of this enzyme, it is believed that they all operate through the same mechanism, only differing by what first reduces the FMN. The enzyme produces two glutamate molecules: one by the hydrolysis of glutamine (forming glutamate and ammonia), and the second by the ammonia produced from the first reaction attacking 2-oxoglutarate, which is reduced by FMN to glutamate.  Clinical significance = Flavoprotein-related diseases  Due to the importance of flavoproteins, it is unsurprising that approximately 60% of human flavoproteins cause human disease when mutated. In some cases, this is due to a decreased affinity for FAD or FMN and so excess riboflavin intake may lessen disease symptoms, such as for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. In addition, riboflavin deficiency itself (and the resulting lack of FAD and FMN) can cause health issues. For example, in ALS patients, there are decreased levels of FAD synthesis. Both of these paths can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental or gastrointestinal abnormalities, faulty fat break-down, anemia, neurological problems, cancer or heart disease, migraine, worsened vision and skin lesions. The pharmaceutical industry therefore produces riboflavin to supplement diet in certain cases. In 2008, the global need for riboflavin was 6,000 tons per year, with production capacity of 10,000 tons. This $150 to 500 million market is not only for medical applications, but is also used as a supplement to animal food in the agricultural industry and as a food colorant.  Drug design  New design of anti-bacterial medications is of continuing importance in scientific research as bacterial antibiotic resistance to common antibiotics increases. A specific metabolic protein that uses FAD (Complex II) is vital for bacterial virulence, and so targeting FAD synthesis or creating FAD analogs could be a useful area of investigation. Already, scientists have determined the two structures FAD usually assumes once bound: either an extended or a butterfly conformation, in which the molecule essentially folds in half, resulting in the stacking of the adenine and isoalloxazine rings. FAD imitators that are able to bind in a similar manner but do not permit protein function could be useful mechanisms of inhibiting bacterial infection. Alternatively, drugs blocking FAD synthesis could achieve the same goal; this is especially intriguing because human and bacterial FAD synthesis relies on very different enzymes, meaning that a drug made to target bacterial FAD synthase would be unlikely to interfere with the human FAD synthase enzymes.  Optogenetics  Optogenetics allows control of biological events in a non-invasive manner. The field has advanced in recent years with a number of new tools, including those to trigger light sensitivity, such as the Blue-Light-Utilizing FAD domains (BLUF). BLUFs encode a 100 to 140 amino acid sequence that was derived from photoreceptors in plants and bacteria. Similar to other photoreceptors, the light causes structural changes in the BLUF domain that results in disruption of downstream interactions. Current research investigates proteins with the appended BLUF domain and how different external factors can impact the proteins.  Treatment monitoring  There are a number of molecules in the body that have native fluorescence including tryptophan, collagen, FAD, NADH and porphyrins. Scientists have taken advantage of this by using them to monitor disease progression or treatment effectiveness or aid in diagnosis.

Using the rational pricing assumption, for a forward contract on an underlying asset that is tradeable, we can express the forward price in terms of the spot price and any dividends. For forwards on non-tradeables, pricing the forward may be a complex task.  Forward price formula  If the underlying asset is tradable and a dividend exists, the forward price is given by: : F = S_0 e^{(r-q)T} - \\\\sum_{i=1}^N D_i e^{(r-q)(T-t_i)} \\\\, where :F is the forward price to be paid at time T :e^x is the exponential function (used for calculating continuous compounding interests) :r is the risk-free interest rate :q is the convenience yield :S_0 is the spot price of the asset (i.e. what it would sell for at time 0) :D_i is a dividend that is guaranteed to be paid at time t_i where 0< t_i < T. Proof of the forward price formula The two questions here are what price the short position (the seller of the asset) should offer to maximize his gain, and what price the long position (the buyer of the asset) should accept to maximize his gain? At the very least we know that both do not want to lose any money in the deal. The short position knows as much as the long position knows: the short/long positions are both aware of any schemes that they could partake on to gain a profit given some forward price. So of course they will have to settle on a fair price or else the transaction cannot occur. An economic articulation would be: :(fair price + future value of asset's dividends) ‚àí spot price of asset = cost of capital : forward price = spot price ‚àí cost of carry The future value of that asset's dividends (this could also be coupons from bonds, monthly rent from a house, fruit from a crop, etc.) is calculated using the risk-free force of interest. This is because we are in a risk-free situation (the whole point of the forward contract is to get rid of risk or to at least reduce it) so why would the owner of the asset take any chances? He would reinvest at the risk-free rate (i.e. U.S. T-bills which are considered risk-free). The spot price of the asset is simply the market value at the instant in time when the forward contract is entered into. So and his net gain can only come from the opportunity cost of keeping the asset for that time period (he could have sold it and invested the money at the risk-free rate). let :K = fair price :C = cost of capital :S = spot price of asset :F = future value of asset's dividend :I = present value of F (discounted using r ) :r = risk-free interest rate compounded continuously :T = length of time from when the contract was entered into Solving for fair price and substituting mathematics we get: : K = C + S - F \\\\, where: :C = S(e^{rT} - 1) \\\\, (since e^{rT} = 1 + j \\\\, where j is the effective rate of interest per time period of T ) : F = c_1 e^{r(T - t_1)} + \\\\cdots + c_n e^{r(T - t_n)} where ci is the ith dividend paid at time t i. Doing some reduction we end up with: : K = (S - I)e^{rT}. \\\\, Notice that implicit in the above derivation is the assumption that the underlying can be traded. This assumption does not hold for certain kinds of forwards. Forward versus futures prices There is a difference between forward and futures prices when interest rates are stochastic. This difference disappears when interest rates are deterministic. In the language of stochastic processes, the forward price is a martingale under the forward measure, whereas the futures price is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure. The forward measure and the risk neutral measure are the same when interest rates are deterministic. See Musiela and Rutkowski's book on Martingale Methods in Financial Markets for a continuous-time proof of this result.

He was the son of George Gwilt, architect surveyor to the county of Surrey, and was born at Southwark. George Gwilt the Younger, was his elder brother. He was educated at St Paul's School, and after a short course of instruction in his father's office was in 1801 admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where in the same year he gained the silver medal for his drawing of the tower and steeple of St Dunstan-in-the- East. In 1811 he published a Treatise on the Equilibrium of Arches, and in 1815 he was elected FSA. After a visit to Italy in 1816, he published in 1818 Notitia architectonica italiana, or Concise Notices of the Buildings and Architects of Italy. In 1825 he published an edition of Sir William Chambers's Treatise on Civil Architecture; and among his other principal contributions to the literature of his profession are a translation of the Architecture of Vitruvius (1826), a Treatise on the Rudiments of Architecture, Practical and Theoretical (1826), and his valuable Encyclopaedia of Architecture (1842), which was published with additions by Wyatt Papworth in 1867. In recognition of Gwilt's advocacy of the importance to architects of a knowledge of mathematics, he was in 1833 elected a member of the Royal Astronomical Society. He took a special interest in philology and music, and was the author of Rudiments of the Anglo-Saxon Tongue (1829), and of the article \\"Music\\" in the Encyclopaedia metropolitana. His principal works as a practical architect were Markree Castle near Sligo in Ireland, and St Thomas's Church (1849‚Äì1850) at CharltonSouthwark diocese entry for church of St Thomas in Kent (today part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich) and the tower of St Thomas, Clapton Common (1829). Gwilt was also associated () with a flawed and short-lived attempt to rebuild the mediaeval predecessor of today's St Margaret's Church in Lee. When it became clear that the foundations of the old church were incapable of supporting a new building, a new church was commissioned, from another architect, on land nearby.History of the Parish Church of St Margaret of Antioch, section 6: History A portrait of him is part of the permanent collection at the National Portrait Gallery in London. In his Encyclopaedia of Architecture, he informs us that standing stones predated all other forms of architecture, that the Druids were the world‚Äôs first race of civilised people, and that at one time the language and alphabet of the entire ancient world from Ireland to India was the same - that of the Irish Druids.

Experimentation with the possible shapes in coffering, which solve problems of mathematical tiling, or tessellation, were a feature of Islamic as well as Renaissance architecture. The more complicated problems of diminishing the scale of the individual coffers were presented by the requirements of curved surfaces of vaults and domes.

As chief founder of the well-known Roman academy called L'Arcadia, he had a considerable share in the reform of Italian poetry, corrupted at that time by the extravagance and bad taste of the poets Giambattista Marini and Giovanni Filoteo Achillini and their school. The poet Guidi and the critic and jurisconsult Gravina checked this evil by their influence and example. The genius of Guidi was lyric in the highest degree; his songs are written with singular force, and charm the reader, in spite of touches of bombast. His most celebrated song is that entitled Alla Fortuna (To Fortune), which certainly is one of the most beautiful pieces of poetry of the 17th century. Guidi was squint-eyed, humpbacked, and of a delicate constitution, but possessed undoubted literary ability. His poems were printed at Parma in 1671, and at Rome in 1704. In 1681 he published at Parma his lyric tragedy Amalasunta in Italy, and two pastoral dramas Daphne and Endymion. The last had the honour of being mentioned as a model by the critic Gravina, in his treatise on poetry. Less fortunate was Guidi's poetical version of the six homilies of Pope Clement XI, first as having been severely criticized by the satirist Settano, and next as having proved to be the indirect cause of the author's death. A splendid edition of this version had been printed in 1712, and, the pope‚Äîbeing then in Castel Gandolfo, Guidi went there to present him with a copy. On the way he found out a serious typographical error, which he took so much to heart that he was seized with an apoplectic fit at Frascati and died on the spot. Guidi was honoured with the special protection of Ranuccio II, duke of Parma, and of Queen Christina of Sweden.

It formed an important link in the developing U.S. railroad system, connecting major trunks to the New York harbor for freight and provided passenger service to central and southern New Jersey. Much of the line is still active and is operated by the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad to serve local customers. Creation Dover and Rockaway Railroad with neighboring CNJ High Bridge Branch lines In the 1870s, Dover businessman George Richards sought the construction of a railroad to carry iron ore from New Jersey's Hibernia mines to the furnaces at High Bridge and in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania for use with the Pennsylvania ores. Richards first suggested to Sam Sloan, the president of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad, that the DL&W; build a spur to along the north side of the Rockaway River through Dover to the Hibernia mines. Sloan turned down the idea. So Richards decided instead to build his own rail connection from his' Hibernia Mine Railroad the Longwood Valley Railroad, which was controlled by the Central Railroad of New Jersey. Along with fellow Dover businessmen Columbus Beach and Henry McFarlan, he incorporated the Dover and Rockaway Railroad in 1880. The Railroad was also built by other men from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts who were interested in the iron mines in the vicinity. Richards negotiated with landowners to acquire right-of-way for his railroad. The line required two major pieces of work :a tunnel under the Rockaway Road east of Dover and cut through solid rock in west Dover above the Mill Pond, next to Clinton Street. The line opened in 1881. On December 22, 1880, Mayor Richards headed a group that made the first trip from Dover to Hibernia. On April 7, 1881, an inspection run was made over the entire line. and the Dover and Rockaway Railroad was soon leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey, completing a route from High Bridge to Hibernia. The Dover line proved to be a valuable addition since it now formed a fast freight service by connecting with every other trunk line reaching the New York harbor. Passenger service provided direct connection to points in central and southern New Jersey. This project perhaps contributed to Dover's \\"Melting Pot\\"; about 50 Swedish immigrants were employed at the eastern end of the cut and Irish immigrants were hired to work the western end. In the meantime, a group of Italian immigrants worked laying track in the East Dover \\"meadows\\". The Swedish labor force was housed in the apartments and hotel buildings on North Sussex Street for the duration of the project. After this link was completed the old farmhouse on North Sussex Street was converted into a train station to become the first Dover terminal, which operated there for over 50 years. Once the line was completed to High Bridge, the building was widely used as a departure and arrival station by the people of such towns as Long Valley, Flanders, Bartley, and Califon as well as nearby communities such as Rockaway, Wharton, and Hibernia.

Chinese folk religion, also known as popular religion, is a polyphyletic term used to describe the diversity of practices in areas generally termed \\"religion\\", of persons of Chinese heritage, including the Chinese diaspora. Vivienne Wee described it as \\"an empty bowl, which can variously be filled with the contents of institutionalized religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, the Chinese syncretic religions, or even Christianity (Catholic) and Hinduism.\\" The restriction of Christianity to Catholicism in her definition has since been broadened by the findings of other investigators. This may include the veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief in the rational order of nature, the universe and reality that can be influenced by human beings and their rulers, as well as spirits and gods. Worship is devoted to a multiplicity of gods and immortals ( ), who can be deities of phenomena, of human behaviour, or progenitors of lineages. Stories regarding some of these gods are collected into the body of Chinese mythology. By the 11th century (Song period), these practices had been blended with Buddhist ideas of karma (one's own doing) and rebirth, and Taoist teachings about hierarchies of gods, to form the popular religious system which has lasted in many ways until the present day. Diversity Ancient Chinese religions have a variety of sources, local forms, founder backgrounds, and ritual and philosophical traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a common core that can be summarised as four theological, cosmological, and moral concepts:Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5-6 Tian (), the transcendent source of moral meaning; qi (), the breath or energy that animates the universe; jingzu (), the veneration of ancestors; and bao ying (), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning:Fan, Chen 2013. p. 21 ming yun (), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and yuan fen (), ‚Äúfateful coincidence‚Äù,Fan, Chen 2013. p. 23 good and bad chances and potential relationships. Yin and yang () is the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of ‚Äúextension‚Äù () and principles of ‚Äúreturning‚Äù (),Teiser, 1996. with yang (\\"act\\") usually preferred over yin (\\"receptiveness\\") in common religion. Ling (), \\"numen\\" or \\"sacred\\", is the \\"medium\\" of the two states and the inchoate order of creation. The present day governments of both China and Taiwan as well as the imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing tolerated village popular religious cults if they bolstered social stability but suppressed or persecuted those that they feared would undermine it. After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate the ancient Chinese religion in order to promote \\"modern\\" values, and many condemned \\"feudal superstition\\". These conceptions of the ancient Chinese religion began to change in Taiwan in the late 20th century and in mainland China in the 21st. Many scholars now view folk religion in a positive light. In recent times the ancient Chinese religion is experiencing a revival in both China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official understanding or recognition as a preservation of traditional ancient Chinese culture, such as Mazuism and the Sanyi teaching in Fujian,Zhuo Xinping, \\"Relationship between Religion and State in the People‚Äôs Republic of China,in Religions & Christianity in Today's China.

In Chinese academic literature and common usage \\"folk religion\\" () refers to specific organised folk religious sects.Clart, 2014. p. 393. Quote: \\"[...] The problem started when the Taiwanese translator of my paper chose to render \\"popular religion\\" literally as minjian zongjiao . The immediate association this term caused in the minds of many Taiwanese and practically all mainland Chinese participants in the conference was of popular sects (minjian jiaopai ), rather than the local and communal religious life that was the main focus of my paper.\\" \\"Folk beliefs\\" () is a technical term with little usage outside the academia, in which it entered into usage at first among Taiwanese scholars from Japanese language during Japan's occupation (1895‚Äì1945), and later between the 1990s and the early 21st century among mainland Chinese scholars. With the rise of the study of traditional cults and the creation of a government agency to give legal status to this religion, intellectuals and philosophers in China have proposed the adoption of a formal name in order to solve the terminological problems of confusion with folk religious sects and conceptualise a definite field for research and administration. The terms that have been proposed include ‚ÄúChinese native religion‚Äù or ‚ÄúChinese indigenous religion‚Äù (), ‚ÄúChinese ethnic religion‚Äù (), or also simply ‚ÄúChinese religion‚Äù () viewed as comparable to the usage of the term ‚ÄúHinduism‚Äù for Indian religion, and ‚ÄúShenxianism‚Äù (, ‚Äúreligion of deities and immortals‚Äù), partly inspired by the term ‚ÄúShenism‚Äù () that was used in the 1950s by the anthropologist Allan J.

It is the native ancient religion of the Han Chinese people: it dates back to time immemorial, over 10,000 years old, and includes all such later phases of its development as Moism, Confucianism (as a state religion), and all the various stages of the Taoist religion.‚Äù Shi Hu, ‚ÄúReligion and Philosophy in Chinese History‚Äù (Shanghai: China Institute of Pacific Relations, 1931), reprinted in Attributes Contemporary Chinese scholars have identified what they find to be the essential features of the ancient (or indigenous‚Äîethnic) religion of China. According to Chen Xiaoyi () local indigenous religion is the crucial factor for a harmonious ‚Äúreligious ecology‚Äù (), that is the balance of forces in a given community. Professor Han Bingfang () has called for a rectification of distorted names (). Distorted names are ‚Äúsuperstitious activities‚Äù () or ‚Äúfeudal superstition‚Äù (), that were derogatorily applied to the indigenous religion by leftist policies. Christian missionaries also used the propaganda label ‚Äúfeudal superstition‚Äù in order to undermine their religious competitor. Han calls for the acknowledgment of the ancient Chinese religion for what it really is, the ‚Äúcore and soul of popular culture‚Äù (). According to Chen Jinguo (), the ancient Chinese religion is a core element of Chinese cultural and religious self-awareness (). He has proposed a theoretical definition of Chinese indigenous religion in ‚Äúthree inseparable attributes‚Äù (), apparently inspired to Tang Junyi's thought: * substance (): religiousness (); * function (): folkloricity (); * quality (): Chineseness ().

Diversity and unity Ancient Chinese religious practices are diverse, varying from province to province and even from one village to another, for religious behaviour is bound to local communities, kinship, and environments. In each setting, institution and ritual behaviour assumes highly organised forms. Temples and the gods in them acquire symbolic character and perform specific functions involved in the everyday life of the local community.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5 Local religion preserves aspects of natural beliefs such as totemism,Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61 animism, and shamanism.Fenggang Yang, Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China: Methodologies, Theories, and Findings . BRILL, 2011. . p. 112 Ancient Chinese religion pervades all aspects of social life. Many scholars, following the lead of sociologist C. K. Yang, see the ancient Chinese religion deeply embedded in family and civic life, rather than expressed in a separate organisational structure like a \\"church\\", as in the West.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4. Deity or temple associations and lineage associations, pilgrimage associations and formalised prayers, rituals and expressions of virtues, are the common forms of organisation of Chinese religion on the local level. Neither initiation rituals nor official membership into a church organisation separate from one person's native identity are mandatory in order to be involved in religious activities. Contrary to institutional religions, Chinese religion does not require \\"conversion\\" for participation. The prime criterion for participation in the ancient Chinese religion is not \\"to believe\\" in an official doctrine or dogma, but \\"to belong\\" to the local unit of an ancient Chinese religion, that is the \\"association\\", the \\"village\\" or the \\"kinship\\", with their gods and rituals. Scholar Richard Madsen describes the ancient Chinese religion, adopting the definition of Tu Weiming,Tu Weiming. The Global Significance of Concrete Humanity: Essays on the Confucian Discourse in Cultural China. India Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 2010. / 9788121512206 as characterised by \\"immanent transcendence\\" grounded in a devotion to \\"concrete humanity\\", focused on building moral community within concrete humanity.Madsen, Secular belief, religious belonging. 2013. Inextricably linked to the aforementioned question to find an appropriate \\"name\\" for the ancient Chinese religion, is the difficulty to define it or clearly outline its boundaries. Old sinology, especially Western, tried to distinguish \\"popular\\" and \\"√©lite\\" traditions (the latter being Confucianism and Taoism conceived as independent systems). Chinese sinology later adopted another dichotomy which continues in contemporary studies, distinguishing \\"folk beliefs\\" (minjian xinyang) and \\"folk religion\\" (minjian zongjiao), the latter referring to the doctrinal sects. Many studies have pointed out that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions, and since the 1970s several sinologists swung to the idea of a unified \\"ancient Chinese religion\\" that would define the Chinese national identity, similarly to Hinduism for India and Shinto for Japan. Other sinologists who have not espoused the idea of a unified \\"national religion\\" have studied Chinese religion as a system of meaning, or have brought further development in C. K. Yang's distinction between \\"institutional religion\\" and \\"diffused religion\\", the former functioning as a separate body from other social institutions, and the latter intimately part of secular social institutions. History= Imperial China  By the Han dynasty, the ancient Chinese religion mostly consisted of people organising into sh√® (\\"group\\", \\"body\\", local community altars) who worshipped their godly principle. In many cases the \\"lord of the she\\" was the god of the earth, and in others a deified virtuous person (xiƒÅn , \\"immortal\\"). Some cults such as that of Liu Zhang, a king in what is today Shandong, date back to this period. From the 3rd century on by the Northern Wei, accompanying the spread of Buddhism in China, strong influences from the Indian subcontinent penetrated the ancient Chinese indigenous religion.

Many ancient temples were destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion and the Boxer Rebellion in the late 1800s.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9 After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 \\"most temples were turned to other uses or were destroyed, with a few changed into schools\\". During the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945 many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare. In the past, popular cults were regulated by imperial government policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing other ones. In the 20th century, with the decline of the empire, increasing urbanisation and Western influence, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer controlling unauthorised worship of unregistered gods, but became the delegitimisation of the ancient Chinese religion as a superstitious obstacle to modernisation. In 1904, a government regulation of the late empire approved for schools to be built through the confiscation of temple property. Various \\"anti-superstition\\" campaigns followed. The Kuomintang government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) intensified the suppression of the ancient Chinese religion with the 1928 \\"Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines\\"; the policy abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius. These policies were the background of those that were implemented in communist China after the Chinese Civil War between the communist People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) and the democratic Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1949. The Cultural Revolution, between 1966 and 1976 of the Chairman Mao period in the communist People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC), was the last systematic effort to destroy the ancient Chinese religion, while in Taiwan the ancient Chinese religion was both preserved and promoted by Republic of China (Taiwan) president Chiang Kai-Shek during his Chinese Cultural Renaissance to counter the Cultural Revolution. After 1978 the ancient Chinese religion started to rapidly revive in China,Fan, Chen 2013. p. 1Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8 with millions of temples being rebuilt or built from scratch. Since the 1980s the central government moved to a policy of benign neglect or wu wei () in regard to rural community life, and the local government's new regulatory relationship with local society is characterized by practical mutual dependence; these factors have given much space for popular religion to develop. In recent years, in some cases, local governments have taken an even positive and supportive attitude towards indigenous religion in the name of promoting cultural heritage. Instead of signaling the demise of traditional ancient religion, China and Taiwan‚Äôs economic and technological industrialization and development has brought a spiritual renewal.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28 As its images and practices integrate the codes of the ancient Chinese culture, the ancient Chinese religion provides the Han Chinese people in both China and Taiwan a means to face the challenges of modernisation. Texts Eastern Han (25-220 AD) Chinese stone- carved que pillar gates of Dingfang, Zhong County, Chongqing that once belonged to a temple dedicated to the Warring States era general Ba Manzi Ancient Chinese religion draws from a vast heritage of sacred books, which according to the general worldview treat cosmology, history and mythology, mysticism and philosophy, as aspects of the same thing. Historically, the revolutionary shift toward a preference for textual transmission and text- based knowledge over long-standing oral traditions first becomes detectable in the 1st century CE. The spoken word, however, never lost its power. Rather than writing replacing the power of the spoken word, both existed side by side. Scriptures had to be recited and heard in order to be efficacious, and the limitations of written texts were acknowledged particularly in Taoism and folk religion. There are the classic books () such as the Confucian canon including the ‚ÄúFour Books and Five Classics‚Äù () and the ‚ÄúClassic of Filial Piety‚Äù (), then there are the Mozi (Mohism), the Huainanzi, the Shizi and the Xunzi. The ‚ÄúInteractions Between Heaven and Mankind‚Äù () is a set of Confucianised doctrines compiled in the Han dynasty by Dong Zhongshu, discussing politics in accordance with a personal Tian of whom mankind is viewed as the incarnation. Taoism has a separate body of philosophical, theological and ritual literature, including the fundamental Daodejing (), the Daozang (Taoist Canon), the Liezi and the Zhuangzi, and a great number of other texts either included or not within the Taoist Canon. Vernacular literature and the folk religious sects have produced a great body of popular mythological and theological literature, the baojuan (). Recent discovery of ancient books, such as the \\"Guodian texts\\" in the 1990s and the Huangdi sijing () in the 1970s, has given rise to new interpretations of the ancient Chinese religion and new directions in its post-Maoist renewal. Many of these books overcome the dichotomy between Confucian and Taoist traditions.Holloway, Kenneth. Guodian: The Newly Discovered Seeds of Chinese Religious and Political Philosophy. Oxford University Press, 2009. The Guodian texts include, among others, the Taiyi Shengshui (). Another book attributed to the Yellow Emperor is the Huangdi yinfujing (). Classical books of mythology include the ‚ÄúClassic of Mountains and Seas‚Äù (), the ‚ÄúRecord of Heretofore Lost Works‚Äù (), ‚ÄúThe Peach Blossom Spring‚Äù (), the ‚ÄúInvestiture of the Gods‚Äù (), and the ‚ÄúJourney to the West‚Äù () among others. Core concepts of theology and cosmology Fan and Chen summarise four spiritual, cosmological, and moral concepts: Tian (), Heaven, the source of moral meaning; qi (), the breath or substance of which all things are made; the practice of jingzu (), the veneration of ancestors; bao ying (), moral reciprocity. Tian, its li and qi north astral pole.Didier, 2009. Represented in vol. III, discussed throughout vols. I, II, and III. \\"Tian is dian (\\"top\\"), the highest and unexceeded. It derives from the characters yi , \\"one\\", and da , \\"big\\".\\" Confucians, Taoists, and other schools of thought share basic concepts of Tian. Tian is both the physical heavens, the home of the sun, moon, and stars, and also the home of the gods and ancestors. Tian by extension is source of moral meaning, as seen in the political principal, Mandate of Heaven, which holds that Tian, responding to human virtue, grants the imperial family the right to rule and withdraws it when the dynasty declines in virtue.Adler, 2011. p. 4 This creativity or virtue (de), in humans is the potentiality to transcend the given conditions and act wisely and morally.Adler, 2011. p. 5 Tian is therefore both transcendent and immanent. Tian is defined in many ways, with many names, the most widely known being T√†id√¨ (the \\"Great Deity\\") and Sh√†ngd√¨ (the \\"Primordial Deity\\"). The concept of Shangdi is especially rooted in the tradition of the Shang dynasty, which gave prominence to the worship of ancestral gods and cultural heroes. The \\"Primordial Deity\\" or \\"Primordial Emperor\\" was considered to be embodied in the human realm as the lineage of imperial power.Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43 Di () is a term meaning \\"deity\\" or \\"emperor\\" (Latin: imperator, verb im-perare; \\"making from within\\"), used either as a name of the primordial god or as a title of natural gods,Chang, 2000. describing a principle that exerts a fatherly dominance over what it produces.Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 64 With the Zhou dynasty, that preferred a religion focused on gods of nature, Tian became a more abstract and impersonal idea of God. A popular representation is the Jade Deity ( Y√πd√¨) or Jade Emperor ( Y√πhu√°ng) originally formulated by Taoists.Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 71 According to classical theology he manifests in five primary forms ( W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨, \\"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\\"). The qi is the breath or substance of which all things are made, including inanimate matter, the living beings, thought and gods.Adler, 2011. pp. 12-13 It is the continuum energy‚Äîmatter.Adler, 2011. p. 21 Stephen F. Teiser (1996) translates it as \\"stuff\\" of \\"psychophysical stuff\\". Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi developed the idea of li , the \\"reason\\", \\"order\\" of Heaven, that is to say the pattern through which the qi develops, that is the polarity of yin and yang.Adler, 2011. p. 13 In Taoism the Tao (\\"Way\\") denotes in one concept both the impersonal absolute Tian and its order of manifestation (li). Yin and yang‚Äîgui and shen Qu√°nj√πnxƒ´ l√≠ngg≈çng, the \\"Numinous Palace by the Brook in the Land of Springs\\", in Quanzhou, Fujian. Yin and yang , whose root meanings respectively are \\"shady\\" and \\"sunny\\", or \\"dark\\" and \\"light\\", are modes of manifestation of the qi, not material things in themselves. Yin is the qi in its dense, dark, sinking, wet, condensing mode; yang denotes the light, and the bright, rising, dry, expanding modality. Described as Taiji (the \\"Great Pole\\"), they represent the polarity and complementarity that enlivens the cosmos. They can also be conceived as \\"disorder\\" and \\"order\\", \\"activity\\" or \\"passivity\\", with act (yang) usually preferred over receptiveness (yin).Thien Do, 2003, pp. 10-11 The concept \\"sh√©n\\" (cognate of shƒìn, \\"extending, expanding\\"Adler, 2011. p. 16) is translated as \\"gods\\" or \\"spirits\\". There are sh√©n of nature; gods who were once people, such as the warrior Guan Gong; household gods, such as the Stove God; as well as ancestral gods (zu or zuxian). In the domain of humanity the shen is the \\"psyche\\", or the power or agency within humans. They are intimately involved in the life of this world. As spirits of stars, mountains and streams, shen exert a direct influence on things, making phenomena appear and things grow or extend themselves. An early Chinese dictionary, the Shuowen jiezi by Xu Shen, explains that they \\"are the spirits of Heaven\\" and they \\"draw out the ten thousand things\\". As forces of growth the gods are regarded as yang, opposed to a yin class of entities called \\"gu«ê\\" (cognate of guƒ´, \\"return, contraction\\"), chaotic beings. A disciple of Zhu Xi noted that \\"between Heaven and Earth there is no thing that does not consist of yin and yang, and there is no place where yin and yang are not found. Therefore there is no place where gods and spirits do not exist\\". The dragon is a symbol of yang, the principle of generation. In Taoist and Confucian thought, the supreme God and its order and the multiplicity of shen are identified as one and the same.Zongqi Cai, 2004. p. 314 In the Yizhuan, a commentary to the Yijing, it is written that \\"one yin and one yang are called the Tao ... the unfathomable change of yin and yang is called shen\\". In other texts, with a tradition going back to the Han period, the gods and spirits are explained to be names of yin and yang, forces of contraction and forces of growth. While in popular thought they have conscience and personality,Adler, 2011. p. 17 Neo-Confucian scholars tended to rationalise them.Adler, 2011. p. 15 Zhu Xi wrote that they act according to the li. Zhang Zai wrote that they are \\"the inherent potential (liang neng) of the two ways of qi\\".Adler, 2011. pp. 15-16 Cheng Yi said that they are \\"traces of the creative process\\". Chen Chun wrote that shen and gui are expansions and contractions, going and coming, of yin and yang‚Äîqi. Hun and po, and zu and xian Ouhai, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. It is a place for the worship of ancestors. Like all things in matter, also humans have a soul that is a dialectic of hun and po (), respectively the yang spirit or mind, and the yin animal soul that is the body.Adler, 2011. p. 19 Hun (mind) is the shen (that gives a form to the qi) of humans, and it develops through the po, stretching and moving intelligently in order to grasp things.Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 68 The po is the \\"feminine\\" soul which controls the physiological and psychological activities of man,Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 69 while the hun, the god attached to the vital breath, is the \\"masculine\\" soul that is totally independent of corporeal substance. The hun is virile, independent and perpetual, and as such it never allows itself to be limited in matter. Otherwise said, the po is the \\"earthly\\" (di) soul that goes downward, while the hun is the \\"heavenly\\" (tian) soul that moves upward. To extend life to its full potential the human shen must be cultivated, resulting in ever clearer, more luminous states of being. It can transform in the pure intelligent breath of deities. In man there's no distinction between rationality and intuition, thinking and feeling: the human being is xin (), mind-heart. With death, while the po returns to the earth and disappears, the hun is thought to be pure awareness or qi, and is the shen to whom ancestral sacrifices are dedicated.Adler, 2011. pp. 19-20 The shen of men who are properly cultivated and honoured after their death are upheld ancestors and progenitors (zuxian or simply zu ).Adler, 2011. p. 14 When ancestries aren't properly cultivated the world falls into disruption, and they become gui. Ancestral worship is intertwined with totemism, as the earliest ancestors of an ethnic lineage are often represented as animals or associated to them.Sautman, 1997. p. 78 Ancestors are means of connection with the Tian, the primordial god which does not have form. As ancestors have form, they shape the destiny of humans. Ancestors who have had a significant impact in shaping the destiny of large groups of people, creators of genetic lineages or spiritual traditions, and historical leaders who have invented crafts and institutions for the wealth of the Chinese nation (culture heroes), are exalted among the highest divine manifestations or immortal beings (xian ).Yao, 2010. p. 162, p. 165 In fact, in the Chinese tradition there is no distinction between gods (shen) and immortal beings (xian), transcendental principles and their bodily manifestations.Yao, 2010. pp. 158-161 Gods can incarnate with a human form and human beings can reach higher spiritual states by the right way of action, that is to say by emulating the order of Heaven.Yao, 2010. p. 159 Humans are considered one of the three aspects of a trinity ( SƒÅnc√°i, \\"Three Powers\\"),Yao, 2010. pp. 162-164 the three foundations of all being; specifically, men are the medium between Heaven that engenders order and forms and Earth which receives and nourishes them. Men are endowed with the role of completing creation. Bao ying and ming yun Anping, Tainan, Taiwan. The Chinese traditional concept of bao ying (\\"reciprocity\\", \\"retribution\\" or \\"judgement\\"), is inscribed in the cosmological view of an ordered world, in which all manifestations of being have an allotted span (shu) and destiny,Yao, 2010. p. 166 and are rewarded according to the moral-cosmic quality of their actions.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 25 It determines fate, as written in Zhou texts: \\"on the doer of good, heaven sends down all blessings, and on the doer of evil, he sends down all calamities\\" ().Fan, Chen 2013. p. 26 The cosmic significance of bao ying is better understood by exploring other two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: * Ming yun (), the personal destiny or given condition of a being in his world, in which ming is \\"life\\" or \\"right\\", the given status of life, and yun defines both \\"circumstance\\" and \\"individual choice\\"; ming is given and influenced by the transcendent force Tian (), that is the same as the \\"divine right\\" (tianming) of ancient rulers as identified by Mencius. Personal destiny (ming yun) is thus perceived as both fixed (as life itself) and flexible, open-ended (since the individual can choose how to behave in bao ying). * Yuan fen (), \\"fateful coincidence\\", describing good and bad chances and potential relationships. Scholars K. S. Yang and D. Ho have analysed the psychological advantages of this belief: assigning causality of both negative and positive events to yuan fen reduces the conflictual potential of guilt and pride, and preserves social harmony.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 24 Ming yun and yuan fen are linked, because what appears on the surface to be chance (either positive or negative), is part of the deeper rhythm that shapes personal life based on how destiny is directed. Recognising this connection has the result of making a person responsible for his or her actions: doing good for others spiritually improves oneself and contributes to the harmony between men and environmental gods and thus to the wealth of a human community.Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 26-27 These three themes of the Chinese tradition‚Äîmoral reciprocity, personal destiny, fateful coincidence‚Äîare completed by a fourth notion:Fan, Chen 2013. p. 27 * Wu (), \\"awareness\\" of bao ying. The awareness of one's own given condition inscribed in the ordered world produces responsibility towards oneself and others; awareness of yuan fen stirs to respond to events rather than resigning. Awareness may arrive as a gift, often unbidden, and then it evolves into a practice that the person intentionally follows. As part of the trinity of being (the Three Powers), humans are not totally submissive to spiritual force. While under the sway of spiritual forces, humans can actively engage with them, striving to change their own fate to prove the worth of their earthly life. In the Chinese traditional view of human destiny, the dichotomy between \\"fatalism\\" and \\"optimism\\" is overcome; human beings can shape their personal destiny to grasp their real worth in the transformation of the universe, seeing their place in the alliance with the gods and with Heaven to surpass the constraints of the physical body and mind. Ling and xianling‚Äîholy and numen Temple of Brahma, or Simianshen ( \\"Four-Faced God\\") in Chinese, in Changhua, Taiwan. The Thai-style worship of Simianshen has its origins among Thai Chinese, and has spread over the last few decades among Mainland Chinese and Overseas Chinese populations. Zhenwu in Wuqi, Taichung, Taiwan. In Chinese religion the concept of ling () is the equivalent of holy and numen.Thien Do, 2003, p. 9 Shen in the meaning of \\"spiritual\\" is a synonym. The Yijing states that \\"spiritual means not measured by yin and yang\\". Ling is the state of the \\"medium\\" of the bivalency (yin-yang), and thus it is identical with the inchoate order of creation. Things inspiring awe or wonder because they can't be fathomed as either yin or yang, because they cross or disrupt the polarity and therefore can't be conceptualised, are regarded as numinous. Entities possessing unusual spiritual characteristics, such as albino members of a species, beings that are part-animal part-human, or people who die in unusual ways such as suicide or on battlefields, are considered numinous. The notion of xian ling (), variously translated as \\"divine efficacy, virtue\\" or simply the \\"numen\\", is important for the relationship between men and gods.Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 179-183 It describes the manifestation, activity, of the power of a god ( ling qi, \\"divine energy\\" or \\"effervescence\\"), the evidence of the holy.Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183-184 The term xian ling may be interpreted as the god revealing his presence in a particular area and temple,Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 184 through events that are perceived as extraordinary, miraculous.Zavidovskaya, 2013. p. 184 Divine power usually manifests in the presence of a wide public. The \\"value\\" of human deities (xian) is judged according to his or her efficacy.Yao, 2010. p. 168 The perceived effectiveness of a deity to protect or bless also determines how much he or she should be worshipped, how big a temple should be built in his or her honour, and what position in the broader pantheon he or she would attain. Zavidovskaya (2012) has studied how the incentive of temple restorations since the 1980s in northern China was triggered by numerous alleged instances of gods becoming \\"active\\" and \\"returning\\", reclaiming their temples and place in society. She mentions the example of a Chenghuang Temple in Yulin, Shaanxi, that was turned into a granary during the Cultural Revolution; it was restored to its original function in the 1980s after seeds stored within were always found to have rotted. This phenomenon, which locals attributed to the god Chenghuang, was taken a sign to empty his residence of grain and allow him back in. The ling qi, divine energy, is believed to accumulate in certain places, temples, making them holy. Temples with a longer history are considered holier than newly built ones, which still need to be filled by divine energy. Another example Zavidovskaya cites is the cult of the god Zhenwu in Congluo Yu, Shanxi;Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 185 the god's temples were in ruins and the cult inactive until the mid 1990s, when a man with terminal cancer, in his last hope prayed (bai ) to Zhenwu. The man began to miraculously recover each passing day, and after a year he was completely healed. As thanksgiving, he organised an opera performance in the god's honour. A temporary altar with a statue of Zhenwu and a stage for the performance were set up in an open space at the foot of a mountain. During the course of the opera, large white snakes appeared, passive and unafraid of the people, seemingly watching the opera; the snakes were considered by locals to be incarnations of Zhenwu, come to watch the opera held in his honour. Within temples, it is common to see banners bearing the phrase \\"if the heart is sincere, the god will reveal his power\\" ( xin cheng shen ling).Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183 The relationship between men and gods is an exchange of favour. This implies the belief that gods respond to the entreaties of the believer if his or her religious fervour is sincere (cheng xin ). If a person believes in the god's power with all his heart and expresses piety, the gods are confident in his faith and reveal their efficacious power. At the same time, for faith to strengthen in the devotee's heart, the deity has to prove his or her efficacy. In exchange for divine favours, a faithful honours the deity with vows (huan yuan or xu yuan ), through individual worship, reverence and respect (jing shen ). The most common display of divine power is the cure of diseases after a believer piously requests aid. Another manifestation is granting a request of children. The deity may also manifest through mediumship, entering the body of a shaman-medium and speaking through them. There have been cases of people curing illnesses \\"on behalf of a god\\" (ti shen zhi bing ). Gods may also speak to people when they are asleep (tuomeng ). Sociological typology Wu Hsin-Chao (2014) distinguishes four kinds of Chinese traditional religious organisation: ancestry worship; deity worship; secret societies; and folk religious sects. Types of indigenous‚Äîethnic religionWorship of local and national deities= P«ît√≥u d√†mi√†o, the \\"First Great Temple by the Riverside\\", in Zhangzhou, Fujian. Chinese religion in its communal expression involves the worship of gods that are the generative power and tutelary spirit (genius loci) of a locality or a certain aspect of nature (for example water gods, river gods, fire gods, mountain gods), or of gods that are common ancestors of a village, a larger identity, or the Chinese nation (Shennong, Huangdi, Pangu). The social structure of this religion is the sh√©nsh√® (literally \\"society of a god\\"), synonymous with shehui , in which sh√® originally meant the altar of a community's earth god, while hu√¨ means \\"association\\", \\"assembly\\", \\"church\\" or \\"gathering\\". This type of religious trusts can be dedicated to a god which is bound to a single village or temple or to a god which has a wider following, in multiple villages, provinces or even a national importance. Mao Zedong distinguished \\"god associations\\", \\"village communities\\" and \\"temple associations\\" in his analysis of religious trusts. p. 353-354 In his words: \\"every kind and type of god [shen] can have an association [hui]\\", for example the Zhaogong Association, the Guanyin Association, the Guangong Association, the Dashen Association, the Bogong Association, the Wenchang Association, and the like. Within the category of hui Mao also distinguished the sacrifice associations (ji√†ohu√¨ ) which make sacrifices in honour of gods. These societies organise gatherings and festivals (miaohui ) participated by members of the whole village or larger community on the occasions of what are believed to be the birthdays of the gods or other events, or to seek protection from droughts, epidemics, and other disasters. Such festivals invoke the power of the gods for practical goals to \\"summon blessings and drive away harm\\". Special devotional currents within this framework can be identified by specific names such as Mazuism ( MƒÅz«îji√†o),Fujian Government's website: Fujian's General Information. . Quote: \\"At present, major religions practiced in Fujian include Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism. In addition, Fujian has its folk belief with deeply local characteristic, such as Mazuism, the belief in Mazu, (which) is very influential\\". Wang Ye worship, or the cult of the Silkworm Mother.Fan Lizhu. The Cult of the Silkworm Mother as a Core of a Local Community Religion in a North China Village: Field Study in Zhiwuying, Baoding, Hebei. The China Quarterly No. 174 (Jun. 2003), 360. This type of religion is prevalent in north China, where lineage religion is absent, private, or historically present only within families of southern origin, and patrilineal ties are based on seniority, and villages are composed of people with different surnames. In this context, the deity societies or temple societies function as poles of the civil organism.Overmyer, 2009. pp. 12-13: \\"As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty mou or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of ‚Äòpopular‚Äô and ‚Äòelite‚Äô and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism.\\" Often deity societies incorporate entire villages; this is the reason why in north China can be found many villages which are named after deities and their temples, for example L√©ish√©nmi√†o village ( \\"[Village of the] Temple of the Thunder God\\") or M«ésh√©nmi√†oc≈´n ( \\"Village of the Temple of the Horse God\\"). =Lineage religion= Guanji temple (left) and Huang ancestral shrine (right) in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Hong'an, Hubei. Another dimension of the Chinese folk religion is based on family or genealogical worship of deities and ancestors in family altars or private temples (simiao or jiamiao ), or ancestral shrines (citang or zongci , or also zumiao ).Fan, Chen 2013. p. 13 Kinship associations or churches (z≈çngz√∫ xi√©hu√¨ ), congregating people with the same surname and belonging to the same kin, are the social expression of this religion: these lineage societies build temples where the deified ancestors of a certain group (for example the Chens or the Lins) are enshrined and worshiped.Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 14-15 These temples serve as centres of aggregation for people belonging to the same lineage, and the lineage body may provide a context of identification and mutual assistance for individual persons. The construction of large and elaborate ancestral temples traditionally represents a kin's wealth, influence and achievement.Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 15 Scholar K. S. Yang has explored the ethno-political dynamism of this form of religion, through which people who become distinguished for their value and virtue are considered immortal and receive posthumous divine titles, and are believed to protect their descendants, inspiring a mythological lore for the collective memory of a family or kin.Fan, Chen 2013. pp. 16 If their temples and their deities enshrined acquire popularity they are considered worthy of the virtue of ling, \\"efficacy\\". Worship of ancestors (jingzu ) is observed nationally with large-scale rituals on Qingming Festival and other holidays. This type of religion prevails in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon seniority, and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent.. Quote: \\"[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.\\" Note 16: The south- vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen‚Äôs article on \\"Lineage organization in North China (1990)\\" offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model \\"the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.\\" By which, he means \\"patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.\\" (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called \\"the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.\\" In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. \\"Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.\\" However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system. In reality, lineage organizations display a mixture between the south and the north model.\\" Philosophical and ritual modalitiesWuism and shamanic traditions= White Sulde of Genghis Khan in the town of Uxin in Inner Mongolia, in the Mu Us Desert. The worship of Genghis is shared by Chinese and Mongolian folk religion. \\"The extent to which shamanism pervaded ancient Chinese society\\", says scholar Paul R. Goldin (2005), \\"is a matter of scholarly dispute, but there can be no doubt that many communities relied upon the unique talents of shamans for their quotidian spiritual needs\\"., p. 99 The Chinese usage distinguishes the Chinese wu tradition or \\"Wuism\\" as it was called by Jan Jakob Maria de Groot ( w≈´ji√†o; properly shamanic, with control over the gods) from the tongji tradition (; mediumship, without control of the godly movement), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms ( s√†m«énji√†o) that are practised in northern provinces. According to Andreea Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the Shang dynasty. What Confucianism did was to marginalise the \\"dysfunctional\\" features of old shamanism. However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.Andreea Chirita. Antagonistic Discourses on Shamanic Folklore in Modern China. On: Annals of Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University, issue 1, 2014. In the Shang and Zhou dynasty, shamans had a role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and man. The mission of a shaman ( wu) is \\"to repair the dis-functionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth\\": ::\\"The female shamans called wu as well as the male shamans called xi represent the voice of spirits, repair the natural dis-functions, foretell the future based on dreams and the art of divination ... \\"a historical science of the future\\", whereas shamans are able to observe the yin and the yang ...\\" Since the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a massive revival in Chinese religion as a means to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialisation. Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as \\"teacher and spirit\\" of peoples. The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in Jilin City in 1988.Kun Shi. Shamanistic Studies in China: A Preliminary Survey of the Last Decade . On: Shaman, vol. 1, nos. 1-2. Ohio State University, 1993, updated in 2006. pp. 104-106 Nuo folk religion is a system of the Chinese folk religion with distinct institutions and cosmology present especially in central-southern China. It arose as an exorcistic religious movement, and it is interethnic but also intimately connected to the Tujia people. =Confucianism, Taoism and orders of ritual masters= Temple of Fortune and Longevity, at the Heavenly Lake of Tianshan in Fukang, Changji, Xinjiang.

Confucianism and Taoism‚Äîwhich are formalised, ritual, doctrinal or philosophical traditions‚Äîcan be considered both as embedded within the larger category of Chinese religion, or as separate religions. In fact, one can practise certain folk cults and espouse the tenets of Confucianism as a philosophical framework, Confucian theology instructing to uphold the moral order through the worship of gods and ancestorsLittlejohn, 2010. pp. 35-37 that is the way of connecting to the Tian and awakening to its harmony (li, \\"rite\\").Tay, 2010. p. 100 Folk temples and ancestral shrines on special occasions may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called r√∫, or sometimes zh√®ngt«íng, meaning \\"orthoprax\\" ritual style) led by Confucian \\"sages of rites\\" ( l«êshƒìng) who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles. There are many organised groups of the folk religion that adopt Confucian liturgy and identity, for example the Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition or phoenix churches (Luanism), or the Confucian churches, schools and fellowships such as the Yƒ´dƒÅn xu√©t√°ng () of Beijing,S√©bastien Billioud.

A Summary of French Studies on Chinese Religion. On: Review of Religion and Chinese Society 1 (2014), 104-127. pp. 105-106 Some currents of Taoism are deeply interwoven with the Chinese folk religion, especially the Zhengyi school, developing aspects of local cults within their doctrines; however Taoists always highlight the distinction between their traditions and those which aren't Taoist. Priests of Taoism are called daoshi (), literally meaning \\"masters of the Tao\\", otherwise commonly translated simply the \\"Taoists\\", as common followers and folk believers who are not part of Taoist orders are not identified as such. Taoists of the Zhengyi school, who are called s«énj≈´ d√†oshi () or hu«íj≈´ d√†oshi (), respectively meaning \\"scattered daoshi\\" and \\"daoshi living at home (hearth)\\", because they can get married and perform the profession of priests as a part-time occupation, may perform rituals of offering (jiao), thanks-giving, propitiation, exorcism and rites of passage for local communities' temples and private homes.Edward L. Davis. Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture. ¬∂ Daoist priests, vernacular priests Local gods of local cultures are often incorporated into their altars. The Zhengyi Taoists are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the Celestial Master,Pas, 2014. p. 259 although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War. Lineages of ritual masters ( fashi), also referred to as practitioners of \\"Faism\\", also called \\"Folk Taoism\\" or (in southeast China) \\"Red Taoism\\", operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism. The ritual masters, who have the same role of the sanju daoshi within the fabric of society, aren't considered Taoist priests by the daoshi of Taoism who trace their lineage to the Celestial Masters and by Taoists officially registered with the state Taoist Church. Fashi are defined as of \\"kataphatic\\" (filling) character in opposition to professional Taoists who are \\"kenotic\\" (of emptying, or apophatic, character).Sarah Coakley. Religion and the Body. Book 8 of Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions. Cambridge University Press, 2000. . p. 246 Organised folk religious sects Qi, Hebi, is the headquarters of the Weixinist Church in Henan. China has a long history of sect traditions characterised by a soteriological and eschatological character, often called \\"salvationist religions\\" ( ji√πd√π z≈çngji√†o),Palmer, 2011. p. 19 which emerged from the common religion but are neither ascribable to the lineage cult of ancestors and progenitors, nor to the communal deity religion of village temples, neighbourhood, corporation, or national temples.Palmer, 2011. pp. 19-20 The 20th-century expression of this religions has been studied under Prasenjit Duara's definition of \\"redemptive societies\\" ( ji√πsh√¨ tu√°nt«ê),Palmer, 2011. p. 17 while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as \\"folk religious sects\\" ( m√≠njiƒÅn z≈çngji√†o, m√≠njiƒÅn ji√†om√©n or m√≠njiƒÅn ji√†op√†i),Palmer, 2011. p. 12 abandoning the ancient derogatory definition of xi√©ji√†o (), \\"evil religion\\".Palmer, 2011. p. 23 They are characterised by egalitarianism, a foundation through a charismatic figure and a direct divine revelation, a millenarian eschatology and voluntary path of salvation, an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, evangelism and philanthropy. Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and recitation of scriptures. Many of the redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to become the repository of the entirety of the Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism.Palmer, 2011. p. 29 This group of religions includesPalmer, 2011. pp. 4-6 Yiguandao and other sects belonging to the Xiantiandao ( \\"Way of Former Heaven\\"), Jiugongdao ( \\"Way of the Nine Palaces\\"), various proliferations of the Luo teaching, the Zaili teaching, and the more recent De teaching, Weixinist, Xuanyuan and Tiandi teachings, the latter two focused respectively on the worship of Huangdi and the universal God. Also, the qigong schools are developments of the same religious context.Palmer, 2011. p. 11 These movements were banned in the early Republican China and later Communist China. Many of them still remain illegal, underground or unrecognised in China, while others‚Äîspecifically the De teaching, Tiandi teachings, Xuanyuan teaching, Weixinism and Yiguandao‚Äîhave developed cooperation with mainland China's academic and non-governmental organisations. The Sanyi teaching is an organised folk religion founded in the 16th century, present in the Putian region (Xinghua) of Fujian where it is legally recognised. Some of these sects began to register as branches of the state Taoist Association since the 1990s.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 347, quote: \\"[Since the 1990s] [...] a number of [...] lay salvationist groups (such as Xiantiandao in southern China and Hongyangism [ H√≥ngy√°ng ji√†o] in Hebei) also successfully registered with the Taoist association, thus gaining legitimacy\\". A further distinctive type of sects of the folk religion, that are possibly the same as the positive \\"secret sects\\", are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the w√©nch«éng ( \\"cultural field\\"), that is the doctrinal aspect characterised by elaborate cosmologies, theologies, initiatory and ritual patterns, and that is usually kept secretive; and the w«îch«éng ( \\"martial field\\"), that is the body cultivation practice and that is usually the \\"public face\\" of the sect.Raymond Ambrosi. Towards the City! Towards the Country! Old Martial Art Strengthens Social Cohesion in Chinese Rural Areas. Goethe-Institut China, 2013. They were outlawed by Ming imperial edicts that continued to be enforced until the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 20th century. An example of martial sect is Meihuaism ( M√©ihuƒÅji√†o, \\"Plum Flowers\\"), that has become very popular throughout northern China. In Taiwan, virtually all of the \\"redemptive societies\\" operate freely since the late 1980s. =Tiandi teachings= The Tiandi teachings is a religion that encompasses two branches, the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue ( TiƒÅnd√© sh√®ngji√†o) and the Church of the Heavenly Deity ( TiƒÅnd√¨ji√†o), both emerged from the teachings of Xiao Changming and Li Yujie, disseminated in the early 20th century.Benoit Vermander. Christianity and the Taiwanese Religious Landscape. On: The Way, 39, 1999. London Society of Jesus. pp. 129-139 The latter is actually an outgrowth of the former established in the 1980s. The religions focus on the worship of Tiandi (), the \\"Heavenly Deity\\" or \\"Heavenly Emperor\\", on health through the proper cultivation of qi, and teach a style of qigong named Tianren qigong.Evelyne Micollier.

Vincent Goossaert has recently (2011) published a review of scholarly works which study \\"north China folk religion\\" as a distinct phenomenon. In contrast to the folk religion of southern and southeastern provinces which is primarily focused on the lineages and their churches (z≈çngz√∫ xi√©hu√¨ ) focusing on ancestral gods, the folk religion of central-northern China (North China Plain) predominantly hinges on the communal worship of tutelary deities of creation and nature as identity symbols by villages populated by families of different surnames, structured into \\"communities of the god(s)\\" (sh√©nsh√® , or hu√¨ , \\"association\\"), which organise temple ceremonies (miaohui ), involving processions and pilgrimages,Overmyer, 2009. p. 10: \\"There were and are many such pilgrimages to regional and national temples in China, and of course such pilgrimages cannot always be clearly distinguished from festivals for the gods or saints of local communities, because such festivals can involve participants from surrounding villages and home communities celebrating the birthdays or death days of their patron gods or saints, whatever their appeal to those from other areas. People worship and petition at both pilgrimages and local festivals for similar reasons. The chief differences between the two are the central role of a journey in pilgrimages, the size of the area from which participants are attracted, and the role of pilgrimage societies in organizing the long trips that may be involved. [...] pilgrimage in China is also characterized by extensive planning and organization both by the host temples and those visiting them.\\" and led by indigenous ritual masters (fashi) who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority. Northern and southern folk religions also have a different pantheon, of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of Chinese mythology.Overmyer, 2009. p. 3: \\"[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped.\\"; p. 33: \\"[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as N√ºwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location.\\" Furthermore, folk religious sects have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern folk religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the heavy importance of mother goddess worship and shamanism,Overmyer, 2009. p. 15: \\"[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non- sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters mu or Laomu, Mother or Venerable Mother, as in Guanyin Laomu, Puxianmu, Dizangmu, etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, Wusheng Laomu, the Eternal Venerable Mother. Puxian and Dizang are bodhisattvas normally considered ‚Äòmale‚Äô, though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don‚Äôt really apply. This practice of adding mu to the names of deities, found already in Ming period sectarian scriptures called baojuan ‚Äòprecious volumes‚Äô from the north, does not occur in the names of southern deities.\\" as well as their scriptural transmission. Confucian churches as well have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of Manchuria and contemporary Shandong has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups. Along the southeastern coast, ritual functions of the folk religion are reportedly dominated by Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms (Zhengyi Taoism and unrecognised fashi orders), which since the 1990s has developed quickly in the area.Chan, 2005. p. 93. Quote: \\"By the early 1990s Daoist activities had become popular especially in rural areas, and began to get out of control as the line between legitimate Daoist activities and popular folk religious activities - officially regarded as feudal superstition - became blurred. [...] Unregulated activities can range from orthodox Daoist liturgy to shamanistic rites. The popularity of these Daoist activities underscores the fact that Chinese rural society has a long tradition of religiosity and has preserved and perpetuated Daoism regardless of official policy and religious institutions. With the growth of economic prosperity in rural areas, especially in the coastal provinces where Daoist activities are concentrated, with a more liberal policy on religion, and with the revival of local cultural identity, Daoism - be it the officially sanctioned variety or Daoist activities which are beyond the edge of the official Daoist body - seems to be enjoying a strong comeback, at least for the time being.\\"Overmyer, 2009. p. 185 about Taoism in southeastern China: \\"Ethnographic research into the temple festivals and communal rituals celebrated within these god cults has revealed the widespread distribution of Daoist ritual traditions in this area, including especially Zhengyi (Celestial Master Daoism) and variants of Lushan Daoist ritual traditions. Various Buddhist ritual traditions (Pu‚Äôanjiao, Xianghua married monks and so on) are practiced throughout this region, particularly for requiem services\\". (quoting K. Dean (2003) Local Communal Religion in Contemporary Southeast China, in D.L. Overmyer (ed.) Religion in China Today. China Quarterly Special Issues, New Series, No. 3. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 32‚Äì34.) Goossaert talks of this distinction, although recognising it as an oversimplification, of a \\"Taoist south\\" and a \\"village-religion/Confucian centre-north\\", with the northern context also characterised by important orders of \\"folk Taoist\\" ritual masters, one of which are the yƒ´ny√°ngshƒìng (\\"sages of yin and yang\\"), and sectarian traditions, and also by a low influence of Buddhism and official Taoism. The folk religion of northeast China has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with Tungus and Manchu shamanisms; these include ch≈´m«éxiƒÅn ( \\"riding for the immortals\\") shamanism, the worship of foxes and other zoomorphic deities, and the Fox Gods ( H√∫sh√©n)‚ÄîGreat Lord of the Three Foxes ( H√∫sƒÅn T√†iy√©) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes ( H√∫sƒÅn T√†in«éi)‚Äîat the head of pantheons. Otherwise, in the religious context of Inner Mongolia there has been a significant integration of Han Chinese into the traditional folk religion of the region. In recent years there has also been an assimilation of deities from Tibetan folk religion, especially wealth gods.Mark Juergensmeyer, Wade Clark Roof. Encyclopedia of Global Religion. SAGE Publications, 2011. . p. 202 In Tibet, across broader western China, and in Inner Mongolia, there has been a growth of the cult of Gesar with the explicit support of the Chinese government, a cross-ethnic Han-Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity (the Han identify him as an aspect of the god of war analogically with Guandi) and culture hero whose mythology is embodied as a culturally important epic poem.Benjamin Penny. Religion and Biography in China and Tibet. Routledge, 2013. . pp. 185-187 =\\"Taoised\\" indigenous religions of ethnic minorities= Sanxing (Three Star Gods) represented in Bai iconographic style at a Benzhu temple on Jinsuo Island, in Dali, Yunnan. Chinese religion has both influenced, and in turn has been influenced by, indigenous religions of ethnic groups that the Han Chinese have encountered along their ethnogenetic history. Seiwert (1987) finds evidence of pre-Chinese religions in the folk religion of certain southeastern provinces such as Fujian and Taiwan, especially in the local wu and lineages of ordained ritual masters.. Available online. A process of sinicization, or more appropriately a \\"Taoisation\\", is also the more recent experience of the indigenous religions of some distinct ethnic minorities of China, especially southwestern people. Chinese Taoists gradually penetrate within the indigenous religions of such peoples, in some cases working side by side with indigenous priests, in other cases taking over the latter's function and integrating them by requiring their ordination as Taoists. Usually, indigenous ritual practices remain unaffected and are adopted into Taoist liturgy, while indigenous gods are identified with Chinese gods. Seiwert discusses this phenomenon of \\"merger into Chinese folk religion\\" not as a mere elimination of non-Chinese indigenous religions, but rather as a cultural re-orientation. Local priests of southwestern ethnic minorities often acquire prestige by identifying themselves as Taoists and adopting Taoist holy texts. Mou (2012) writes that \\"Taoism has formed an indissoluble bond\\" with indigenous religions of southwestern ethnic minorities, especially the Tujia, Yi and Yao. Seiwert mentions the Miao of Hunan. \\"Daogongism\\" is Taoism among the Zhuang, directed by the d√†og≈çng ( \\"lords of the Tao\\") and it forms an established important aspect of the broader Zhuang folk religion.Ya-ning Kao, Religious Revival among the Zhuang People in China: Practising \\"Superstition\\" and Standardizing a Zhuang Religion Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, 43, 2, 107‚Äì144. 2014. (online), (print). p. 117 On the other hand, it is also true that in more recent years there has been a general revival of indigenous lineages of ritual masters without identification of these as Taoists and support from the state Chinese Taoist Church. An example is the revival of lineages of bimo (\\"scripture sages\\") priests among the Yi peoples. Bimoism has a tradition of theological literature and though clergy ordination, and this is among the reasons why it is taken in high consideration by the Chinese government.Olivia Kraef. Of Canons and Commodities: The Cultural Predicaments of Nuosu-Yi \\"Bimo Culture\\". On: Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, 43, 2, 145‚Äì179. 2014. pp. 146-147 Bamo Ayi (2001) attests that \\"since the early 1980s ... minority policy turned away from promoting assimilation of Han ways\\".Bamo Ayi. On the Nature and Transmission of Bimo Knowledge in Liangshan. In: Harrell, Stevan, ed. Perspectives on the Yi of Southwest China. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001. Features=Theory of hierarchy and divinity Chinese religions are polytheistic, meaning that many deities are worshipped as part of what has been defined as y«îzh√≤u sh√©nl√πn (), translated as \\"cosmotheism\\", a worldview in which divinity is inherent to the world itself. The gods (shen ; \\"growth\\", \\"beings that give birth\\"Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 63) are interwoven energies or principles that generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the way of Heaven, that is to say the order (li) of the Greatnine(Tian). In Chinese tradition, there is not a clear distinction between the gods and their physical body or bodies (from stars to trees and animals);Yao, 2010. p. 158 the qualitative difference between the two seems not to have ever been emphasised. Rather, the disparity is said to be more quantitative than qualitative. In doctrinal terms, the Chinese view of gods is related to the understanding of qi, the life force, as the gods and their phenomenal productions are manifestations of it. In this way, all natural bodies are believed to be able to attain supernatural attributes by acting according to the universal oneness. Meanwhile, acting wickedly (that is to say against the Tian and its order) brings to disgrace and disaster.Yao, 2010. p. 165 In folk religions, gods (shen) and immortals (xian ) are not specifically distinguished from each other.Yao, 2010. p. 161 Gods can incarnate in human form and human beings can reach immortality, which means to attain higher spirituality, since all the spiritual principles (gods) are begotten of the primordial qi before any physical manifestation. In the Doctrine of the Mean, one of the Confucian four books, the zhenren (wise) is the man who has achieved a spiritual status developing his true sincere nature.Yao, 2010. p. 162 This status, in turn, enables him to fully develop the true nature of others and of all things. The sage is able to \\"assist the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth\\", forming a trinity (‰∏âÊâç SƒÅnc√°i, the \\"Three Powers\\") with them. In other words, in the Chinese tradition humans are or can be the medium between Heaven and Earth, and have the role of completing what had been initiated. Taoist schools in particular espouse an explicit spiritual pathway which pushes the earthly beings to the edge of eternity. Since the human body is a microcosm, enlivened by the universal order of yin and yang like the whole cosmos, the means of immortality can be found within oneself. Among those worshipped as immortal heroes (xian, exalted beings) are historical individuals distinguished for their worth or bravery, those who taught crafts to others and formed societies establishing the order of Heaven, ancestors or progenitors (zu ), and the creators of a spiritual tradition.Lu, Gong. 2014. p. 38: Xian are described as individuals who achieve mastery of the way of Heaven and emulate it. The concept of \\"human divinity\\" is not self- contradictory, as there is no unbridgeable gap between the two realms; rather, the divine and the human are mutually contained. In comparison with gods of an environmental nature, who tend to remain stable throughout human experience and history, individual human deities change in time. Some endure for centuries, while others remain localised cults, or vanish after a short time. Immortal beings are conceived as \\"constellations of qi\\", which is so vibrant in certain historical individuals that, upon the person's death, this qi nexus does not dissipate but persists, and is reinforced by living people's worship.Raymond Barnett. Relax, You're Already Home: Everyday Taoist Habits For A Richer Life. J. P. Tarcher, 2004. The energetic power of a god is thought to reverberate on the worshipers influencing their fortune. =Deities and immortals= Main altar and statue of Doumu inside the Temple of Doumu in Butterworth, Penang, Malaysia. Statue and ceremonial complex of the Yellow and Red Gods, from whom the Han Chinese are said to be the descendants, in Zhengzhou, Henan. Gods and immortals (collectively sh√©nxiƒÅn) in the Chinese cultural tradition reflect a hierarchical, multiperspective experience of divinity. In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between sh√©n, d√¨ and xiƒÅn. Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between \\"god\\" and \\"deity\\", Latin genius (meaning a generative principle, \\"spirit\\") and deus or divus; d√¨, sometimes translated as \\"thearch\\", implies a manifested or incarnate \\"godly\\" power. It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of di as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the Shuowen jiezi explaining \\"deity\\" as \\"what faces the base of a melon fruit\\". The latter term xiƒÅn unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, similarly to the Western idea of \\"hero\\". Many classical books have lists and hierarchies of gods and immortals, among which the \\"Completed Record of Deities and Immortals\\" ( Sh√©nxiƒÅn t≈çngji√†n) of the Ming dynasty, and the \\"Biographies of Deities and Immortals\\" ( Sh√©nxiƒÅn zhu√°n) by Ge Hong (284-343). There's also the older Liexian zhuan ( \\"Collected Biographies of Immortals\\"). There are the great cosmic gods representing the first principle in its unmanifested state or its creative order‚ÄîYudi ( \\"Jade Deity\\") and Doumu ( \\"Mother of the Meaning\\" or \\"Great Chariot\\"), Pangu (, the macranthropic metaphor of the cosmos), Xiwangmu ( \\"Queen Mother of the West\\") and Dongwanggong ( \\"King Duke of the East\\") who personificate respectively the yin and the yang, as well as the dimensional Three Patrons and the Five Deities; then there are the sky and weather gods, the scenery gods, the vegetal and animal gods, and gods of human virtues and crafts. These are interpreted in different ways in Taoism and folk sects, the former conferring them long kataphatic names. Below the great deities, there is the unquantifiable number of gods of nature, as every phenomena have or are gods. The Three Patrons ( SƒÅnhu√°ng)‚ÄîFuxi, N√ºwa and Shennong‚Äîare the \\"vertical\\" manifestation of the primordial God corresponding to the Three Realms ( SƒÅnji√®), representing the yin and yang and the medium between them, that is the human being.Journal of Chinese Religions, 24-25, 1996. p. 6 The Five Deities ( W«îd√¨) or \\"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\\" ( W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨)‚Äîthe Yellow, Green or Blue, Black, Red and White Deities‚Äîare the five \\"horizontal\\" manifestations of the primordial God and according with the Three Realms they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. They correspond to the five phases of creation, the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole, the five sacred mountains and the five directions of space (the four cardinal directions and the centre), and the five Dragon Gods ( L√≥ngsh√©n) which represent their mounts, that is to say the chthonic forces they preside over. The Yellow God ( Hu√°ngsh√©n) or \\"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\\" ( Hu√°ngsh√©n Bƒõid«íu) is of peculiar importance, as he is a form of the universal God (Tian or Shangdi) symbolising the axis mundi (Kunlun), or the intersection between the Three Patrons and the Five Deities, that is the center of the cosmos. He is therefore described in the Shizi as the \\"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\\" ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n). His human incarnation, the \\"Yellow Emperor (or Deity) of the Mysterious Origin\\" ( XuƒÅnyu√°n Hu√°ngd√¨), is said to be the creator of the Huaxia civility, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and patriarch of all the Chinese together with the Red Deity. Xuanyuan was the fruit of virginal birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning from the Big Dipper.Yves Bonnefoy, Asian Mythologies. University of Chicago Press, 1993. . p. 246 =Mother goddess worship= Shrine of Bixia at Mount Tai, Shandong. The worship of mother goddesses for the cultivation of offspring is present all over China, but predominantly in northern provinces. There are nine main goddesses, and all of them tend to be considered as manifestations or attendant forces of a singular goddess identified variously as Bixia ( \\"Blue Dawn\\"), the daughter or female consort of the Green God of Mount Tai, or Houtu ( the \\"Queen of the Earth\\").Jones, 2013. pp. 166-167 Bixia herself is identified by Taoists as the more ancient goddess Xiwangmu,Louis Komjathy.

Goddesses are commonly entitled m«î ( \\"mother\\"), l«éom«î ( \\"old mother\\"), sh√®ngm«î ( \\"holy mother\\"), ni√°ngni√°ng ( \\"lady\\"), n«éinai ( \\"granny\\"). Altars of goddess worship are usually arranged with Bixia at the center and two goddesses at her sides, most frequently the Lady of Eyesight and the Lady of Offspring.Ann Elizabeth Barrott Wicks. Children in Chinese Art. University of Hawaii Press, 2002. . pp. 149-150; some goddesses are enlisted in the note 18 at p. 191 A different figure but with the same astral connections as Bixia is the Qixing Niangniang ( \\"Goddess of the Seven Stars\\"). There is also the cluster of the Holy Mothers of the Three Skies ( Sanxiao Shengmu; or \\"Ladies of the Three Skies\\", Sanxiao Niangniang), composed of Yunxiao Guniang, Qiongxiao Guniang and Bixiao Guniang. In southeastern provinces the cult of Chen Jinggu () is identified by some scholars as an emanation of the northern cult of Bixia.J. Hackin. Asiatic Mythology: A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of All the Great Nations of Asia. Asian Educational Services, 1932. . pp. 349.350 There are other local goddesses with motherly features, including the northern Canmu ( \\"Silkworm Mother\\") and Mazu ( \\"Ancestral Mother\\"), popular in provinces along the eastern coast and in Taiwan. The title of \\"Queen of Heaven\\" ( TiƒÅnh√≤u) is most frequently attributed to Mazu and Doumu (the cosmic goddess). Worship and modalities of religious practice Procession with a traveling image of a god (x√≠ngsh√©n ) in central Taiwan. Vows to a deity at a Chinese temple in Vietnam. Xiao ancestral temple of Chaoyang, Shantou, Guangdong. Adam Yuet Chau identifies five styles or modalities of \\"doing\\" Chinese religion: * Discursive-scriptural: involving the composition, preaching, and recitation of texts (classics, Taoist scriptures and morality books); * Personal cultivation mode, involving a long-term cultivation and transformation of oneself with the goal of becoming a xian (immortal), zhenren (\\"true person\\"), or shengren (wise), through the practice of different \\"technologies of the self\\" (qigong , Taoist inner and outer alchemy, charitable acts for merit, memorisation and recitation of texts); * Liturgical: involving elaborate ritual procedures conducted by specialists of rites (Taoist rites, Confucian rites, Nuo rites, fengshui ); * Immediate practical: aiming at quick efficacious (ling ) results through simple ritual and magical techniques (divination, talismans, divine medicine, consulting media and shamans); * Relational: emphasising the devotional relationship between men and deities and among men themselves (organising elaborate sacrifices, making vows, organising temple festivals, pilgrimages, processions, and religious communities) in \\"social comings and goings\\" (laiwang ) and \\"interconnectedness\\" (guanxi ). Generally speaking, the Chinese believe that spiritual and material well-being ensues from the harmony of humanity and gods in their participation in the same cosmic power, and also believe that by taking the right path and practice anybody is able to reach the absolute reality.Yao, 2010. p. 173 Religious practice is therefore regarded as the bridge to link the human world to the spiritual source, maintaining the harmony of the micro and macrocosmos, protecting the individual and the world from disruption. In this sense, the Chinese view of human life is not deterministic, but one is a master of his own life and can choose to collaborate with the deities for a harmonious world. Chinese culture being a holistic system, in which every aspect is a part of a whole, Chinese folk religious practice is often intermingled with political, educational and economic concerns.Yao, 2010. p. 172 A gathering or event may be encompassed with all of these aspects; in general, the commitment (belief) and the process or rite (practice) together form the internal and external dimensions of Chinese religious life. In village communities, religious services are often organised and led by local people themselves. Leaders are usually selected among male heads of families or lineages, or village heads. A simple form of individual practice is to show respect for the gods (jing shen ) through jingxiang (incense offering), and the exchange of vows (huan yuan ). Sacrifice can consist of incense, oil, and candles, as well as money.Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10 Religious devotion may also express in the form of performance troupes (huahui), involving many types of professionals such as stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, yangge dancers, and story-tellers. Deities can also be respected through moral deeds in their name (shanshi ), and self-cultivation (xiuxing ).Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 191 Some forms of folk religion develop clear prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of \\"morality books\\" (shanshu ) and ledgers of merit and demerit.Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182 Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways for accumulating merit (gongde ). Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as energetic centre of the human body (zai jun xin zuo tian fu ).Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 187 Practices of communication with the gods comprehend different forms of Chinese shamanism, such as wu shamanism and tongji mediumship, or fuji practice. =Sacrifices= Tray for offering sacrifices, on display in Kaiping Classical Chinese has characters for different types of sacrifice, probably the oldest way to communicate with divine forces, today generally encompassed by the definition j√¨s√¨ . However different in scale and quantity, all types of sacrifice would normally involve food, wine, meat and later incense.Yao, 2010. p. 176 Sacrifices usually differ according to the kind of deity they are devoted to. Traditionally, cosmic and nature gods are offered uncooked (or whole) food, while ancestors are offered cooked food. Moreover, sacrifices for gods are made inside the temples that enshrine them, while sacrifices for ancestors are made outside temples. Yearly sacrifices (ji) are made to Confucius, the Red and Yellow Emperors, and other cultural heroes and ancestors. Both in past history and at the present, all sacrifices are assigned with both religious and political purposes.Yao, 2010. p. 177 Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example the River God ( H√©sh√©n) and Dragon Gods, and offering to them requires animal sacrifice.Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189 =Thanksgiving and redeeming= The aims of rituals and sacrifices may be of thanksgiving and redeeming, usually involving both. Various sacrifices are intended to express gratitude toward the gods in the hope that spiritual blessing and protection will continue. The ji√†o , an elaborate Taoist sacrifice or \\"rite of universal salvation\\", is intended to be a cosmic community renewal, that is to say a reconciliation of a community around its spiritual centre.Yao, 2010. p. 178 The jiao ritual usually starts with zhai, \\"fasting and purification\\", that is meant as an atonement for evil-doing, then followed by sacrificial offerings. This rite, of great political importance, can be intended for the whole nation. In fact, as early as the Song dynasty, emperors asked renowned Taoists to perform such rituals on their behalf or for the entire nation. The modern Chinese republic has given approval for Taoists to conduct such rituals since the 1990s, with the aim of protecting the country and the nation. =Rites of passage= Guan Li, Confucian coming of age ceremony. A variety of practices are concerned with personal well-being and spiritual growth.Yao, 2010. p. 180 Rites of passage are intended to narrate the holy significance of each crucial change throughout a life course. These changes, which are physical and social and at the same time spiritual, are marked by elaborate customs and religious rituals. In the holistic view about nature and the human body and life, as macro and microcosmos, the life process of a human being is equated with the rhythm of seasons and cosmic changes. Hence, birth is likened to spring, youth to summer, maturity to autumn and old age to winter. There are ritual passages for those who belong to a religious order of priests or monks, and there are the rituals of the stages in a life, the main four being birth, adulthood, marriage and death.Yao, 2010. p. 181 Places of worship Chinese language has a variety of words defining the temples of the Chinese religion. Some of these terms have a precise functional use, although with time some confusion has arisen and some of them have been used interchangeably in some contexts. Collective names defining \\"temples\\" or places of worship are s√¨mi√†o and mi√†oy«î. However, s√¨, which originally meant a type of residence for imperial officials, with the introduction of Buddhism in China became associated with Buddhist monasteries as many officials donated their residences to the monks. Today s√¨ and s√¨yu√†n (\\"monastery\\") are used almost exclusively for Buddhist monasteries, with sporadic exceptions, and s√¨ is a component character of names for Chinese mosques. Another term now mostly associated with Buddhism is ƒÅn, \\"thatched hut\\", originally a form of dwelling of monks later extended to mean monasteries. Temples can be public, private ( s√¨mi√†o) and household temples ( jiƒÅmi√†o). The jing is a broader \\"territory of a god\\", a geographic region or a village or city with its surroundings, marked by multiple temples or complexes of temples and delineated by the processions. Pertaining to Chinese religion the most common term is mi√†o graphically meaning a \\"shrine\\" or \\"sacred enclosure\\"; it is the general Chinese term that is translated with the general Western \\"temple\\", and is used for temples of any of the deities of polytheism. Other terms include di√†n which indicates the \\"house\\" of a god, enshrining one specific god, usually a chapel within a larger temple or sacred enclosure; and t√°n which means \\"altar\\" and refers to any indoor or outdoor altars, majestic outdoor altars being those for the worship of Heaven and Earth and other gods of the environment. G≈çng, originally referring to imperial palaces, became associated to temples of representations of the universal God or the highest gods and consorts, such as the Queen of Heaven. Another group of words is used for the temples of ancestral religion: c√≠ (either \\"temple\\" or \\"shrine\\", meaning a sacred enclosure) or z≈çngc√≠ (\\"ancestor shrine\\"). These terms are also used for temples dedicated to immortal beings. Z«îmi√†o (\\"original temple\\") instead refers to a temple which is believed to be the original temple of a deity, the most legitimate and powerful.Tan, Chee- Beng. Tianhou and the Chinese in Diaspora. Chapter in the Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Diaspora. Routledge, 2013. . p. 423 T√°ng, meaning \\"hall\\" or \\"church hall\\", originally referred to the central hall of secular buildings but it entered religious usage as a place of worship of the folk religious sects. Christianity in China has borrowed this term from the sects. Gu√†n is the appropriate Chinese translation of the Western term \\"temple\\", as both refer to \\"contemplation\\" (of the divine, according to the astral patterns in the sky or the icon of a deity). Together with its extension d√†ogu√†n (\\"to contemplate or observe the Dao\\"), it is used exclusively for Taoist temples and monasteries of the state Taoist Church. Generic terms include yu√†n meaning \\"sanctuary\\", from the secular usage for a courtyard, college or hospital institution; y√°n (\\"rock\\") and d√≤ng (\\"hole\\", \\"cave\\") referring to temples set up in caves or on cliffs. Other generic terms are f«î (\\"house\\"), originally of imperial officials, which is a rarely used term; and t√≠ng (\\"pavilion\\") which refers to the areas of a temple where laypeople can stay. There is also sh√©nc√≠, \\"shrine of a god\\". Ancestral shrines are sacred places in which lineages of related families, identified by shared surnames, worship their common progenitors. These temples are the \\"collective representation\\" of a group, and function as centers where religious, social and economic activities intersect.Zai Liang, Steven Messner, Cheng Chen, Youqin Huang. The Emergence of a New Urban China: Insiders' Perspectives. Lexington Books, 2013. . p. 95 Chinese temples are traditionally built according to the styles and materials (wood and bricks) of Chinese architecture, and this continues to be the rule for most of the new temples. However, in the early 20th century and especially in the mainland religious revival of the early 21st century, there has been a proliferation of new styles in temple construction. These include the use of new materials (stones and concrete, stainless steel and glass) and the combination of Chinese traditional shapes with styles of the West or of transnational modernity. Examples can be found in the large ceremonial complexes of mainland China. =Temple networks and gatherings= Gathering at a Temple of the City God of Guangzhou, Guangdong. FƒìnxiƒÅng, meaning an \\"incense division\\", is a term that defines both hierarchical networks of temples dedicated to a god, and the ritual process by which these networks form. These temple networks are economic and social bodies, and in certain moments of history have even taken military functions. They also represent routes of pilgrimage, with communities of devotees from the affiliated temples going up in the hierarchy to the senior temple (zumiao). When a new temple dedicated to the same god is founded, it enters the network through the ritual of division of incense. This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple. The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older temple where the ashes were taken, and directly below it in the hierarchy of temples. Mi√†ohu√¨, literally \\"gatherings at the temple\\", are \\"collective rituals to greet the gods\\" ( y√≠ngsh√©n s√†ihu√¨) that are held at the temples on various occasions such as the Chinese New Year or the birthday or holiday of the god enshrined in the temple. pp. 815-816 In north Chine they are also called s√†ihu√¨ (\\"communal ritual gatherings\\") or xiƒÅnghu√¨ (\\"incense gatherings\\"), while a s√†ish√® (\\"communal ritual body\\") is the association which organises such events and by extension it has become another name of the event itself. Activities include rituals, theatrical performances, processions of the gods' images throughout villages and cities, and offerings to the temples. In north China temple gatherings are generally week-long and large events attracting tens of thousands of people, while in south China they tend to be smaller and village- based events. Demographics=Mainland China and Taiwan Plum Flower folk religious sect in Xingtai, Hebei. According to Yang and Hu (2012): ::\\"Chinese folk religion deserves serious research and better understanding in the social scientific study of religion. This is not only because of the sheer number of adherents‚Äîseveral times more adherents than Christians and Buddhists combined, but also because folk religion may have significant social and political functions in China's transition.\\" According to their research, 55.5% of the adult population (15+) of China, or 578 million people in absolute numbers, believe and practise folk religions, including a 20% who practice ancestor religion or communal worship of deities, and the rest who practise what Yang and Hu define \\"individual\\" folk religions like devotion to specific gods such as Caishen. Members of folk religious sects are not taken into account. Around the same year, Kenneth Dean estimates 680 million people involved in folk religion, or 51% of the total population. At the same time, self-identified folk religion believers in Taiwan are 42.7% of the adult (20+) population, or 16 million people in absolute numbers, although devotion to ancestors and gods can be found even among other religions' believers or 88% of the population. According to the 2005 census of Taiwan, Taoism is the statistical religion of 33% of the population. The Chinese Spiritual Life Survey conducted by the Center on Religion and Chinese Society of Purdue University, published in 2010, found that 754 million people (56.2%) practise ancestor religion, but only 216 million people (16%) \\"believe in the existence\\" of the ancestor. The same survey says that 173 million (13%) practise Chinese folk religion in a Taoist framework.2010 Chinese Spiritual Life Survey, Anna Sun, Purdue University‚Äôs Center on Religion and Chinese Society.

Published in The World Religious Cultures issue 2014: . published in 2014, based on the Chinese General Social Surveys which are held on robust samples of tens of thousands of people, found that only 12.6% of the population of China belongs to its five state-sanctioned religious groups, while among the rest of the population only 6.3% are atheists, and the remaining 81% (1 billion people) pray to or worship gods and ancestors in the manner of the traditional popular religion. The same survey has found that 2.2% (‚âà30 million) of the total population declares to be affiliated to one or another of the many folk religious sects. At the same time, reports of the Chinese government claim that the sects have about the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions counted together (~13% ‚âà180 million).

Pu Shi Institute for Social Science: full text of the article. =Economy of temples and rituals= Folk temple on the rooftop of a commercial building in the city of Wenzhou. Scholars have studied the economic dimension of Chinese folk religion,Graeme Lang, Selina Ching Chan, Lars Ragvald. Folk Temples and the Chinese Religious Economy. On Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion, 2005, Volume 1, Article 4. whose rituals and temples interweave a form of grassroots socio-economic capital for the well-being of local communities, fostering the circulation of wealth and its investment in the \\"sacred capital\\" of temples, gods and ancestors. This religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern Taiwan, and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural China, especially the southern and eastern coasts. According to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the recostruction of patriarchal civilisation: ::\\"Similar to the case in Taiwan, the practice of folk religion in rural southern China, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, has thrived as the economy has developed. ... In contrast to Weberian predictions, these phenomena suggest that drastic economic development in the Pearl River Delta may not lead to total disenchantment with beliefs concerning magic in the cosmos. On the contrary, the revival of folk religions in the Delta region is serving as a countervailing re-embedding force from the local cultural context, leading to the coexistence of the world of enchantments and the modern world.\\" Mayfair Yang (2007) defines it as an \\"embedded capitalism\\", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an \\"ethical capitalism\\" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity which foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society. Overseas Chinese Temple of Mazu in Yokohama, serving the Chinese of Japan. Most of the overseas Chinese populations have maintained Chinese folk religions, often adapting to the new environment by developing new cults and incorporating elements of local traditions. In Southeast Asia, Chinese deities are subject to a \\"re- territorialisation\\" and maintain their relation to the ethnic associations (i.e. the Hainanese Association or the Fujianese Association, each of them has a patron deity and manages one or more temples of such a deity).Tan, Chee- Beng. Tianhou and the Chinese in Diaspora. Chapter in the Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Diaspora. Routledge, 2013. . pp. 417-422 The most important deity among Southeast Asian Chinese is Mazu, the Queen of Heaven and goddess of the sea. This is related to the fact that most of these Chinese populations are from southeastern provinces of China, where the goddess is very popular. Some folk religious sects have spread successfully among Southeast Asian Chinese. They include especially Church of Virtue (Deism),Bernard Formoso.

Category:East Asian religions Category:Folk religion ","title":"Chinese folk religion"},{"id":"1491161","text":"right Alessandro Achillini (Latin Alexander Achillinus; 20 or 29 October 1463 (or possibly 1461)2 August 1512) was an Italian philosopher and physician. Biography Achillini was born in Bologna and lived the majority of his life there. He was the son of Claudio Achillini, member of an old family of Bologna. He was celebrated as a lecturer both in medicine and in philosophy at Bologna and Padua, and was styled the second Aristotle. He was of a very simplistic nature. He was unskilled in the arts of adulation and double- dealing to such a degree that his most witty and imprudent students often regarded him as an object of ridicule, even though they honored him as a teacher. He also possessed quite a lively disposition. According to a colleague's description, he was handsome, tall but well proportioned, cheerful, happy, often smiling, and affable. See pp. 24-25. Achillini never married. His reputation among his colleagues was admirable and he was highly respected. And although Achillini was well-read and formidable in debate, he was said to be somewhat rigid and stiff in his lecturing. After his death, many people were extremely devastated. His philosophical works were printed in one volume folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with considerable additions in 1545, 1551 and 1568. He died in Bologna on 2 August 1512 and was buried the following day in St. Martin's Church. Among his notable discoveries, he is known as the first anatomist to describe the two tympanal bones of the ear, termed malleus and incus. In 1503 he showed that the tarsus (middle part of the foot) consists of seven bones, he rediscovered the fornix and the infundibulum of the brain. He also described the ducts of the submaxillary salivary glands. His brother was the author Giovanni Filoteo Achillini, and his grandnephew, Claudio Achillini (1572-1640), was a lawyer. In 1506, he was obliged to leave Bologna owing to the expulsion of the powerful Bentivoglio family of whom he was a partisan. He then went to Padua where he was appointed teacher of philosophy. Career Alessandro Achillini began teaching when he was 21 years old. From the years 1484-1512, except 1506-1508, he was a professor of Medicine and/or Philosophy in the University of Bologna. During the 2-year period between 1506-1508 Achillini was a Professor at the University of Padua. Achillini taught at Bologna for twenty- eight years, which is longer than anyone who has ever taught at Bologna in medicine or philosophy. See pp. 91-92. The University of Padua had a statute, that if a professor failed to read on any assigned day, or failed to have a certain number students it would be documented and then later there would be a diminution of salary per occurrence. During the months of December‚ÄìMarch 1506 ‚Äì 1507 Achillini did not meet the requirement for reading, to which he was penalized 351 Bolognese Lire. See p. 94. Achillini also received two strongly- worded letters in August and September 1507 from the Commune of Bologna stating that his absence was unauthorized, and if it continued he would be penalized severely (500 ducats of gold for the first offense). See p. 92. Achillini attended many doctoral committees as a member for the examination and approval of candidates. There are records of him attending at least ninety times to these proceedings. The proceedings are doctoral examinations or elections of new members to the Company of Collegiate Doctors. In addition, Achillini's was well versed in theology. His initial designs indicate an interest in entering the priesthood. He appears to have begun his seminar studies prior to 1476; the year he entered the tonsure at the Cathedral of Bologna. And though he later shifted his focus to academia, he remained an active theologian throughout his life and contributed to two General Congresses of the Franciscan Order; one in Bologna in 1494 and another held in Rome between 1505 and 1506. While in residence at Bologna, Achillini is credited as being instrumental in generating interest in William of Ockham. The extent of Achillini's endorsement is difficult to discern, but it is believed he and his contemporaries at the university instigated a brief Ockhamistic revival as reflected by his students' later works. Publications The ‚ÄúAnatomical Notes by the Great Alexander Achillinus of Bologna‚Äù demonstrate a detailed description of the human body. Achillini compares what he has found during his dissections to what others like Galen and Avicenna have found and notes their similarities and differences. Achillinus states there are seven features when examining the body instead of the believed six given in Galen's book On Sects. These seven features are size, number, location, form, substance as in thin or thick, substance as in fleshy or bony, and complexion. In this work, Achillinus also gives directions as how to proceed with certain dissections and procedures such as castration, extraction of stone, and removal of the rib cage to further examine the heart and lungs. He was also distinguished as an anatomist, among his writings being De humani corporis anatomia (Venice, 1516‚Äì1524), and Annotationes anatomicae (Bologna, 1520). Achillini's Annotationes Anatomicae was first published by his brother, Giovanni Filoteo, on 24 September 1520. It was published in a small format of eighteen folios with a pair of poems of six and two lines each.

It tells the parallel stories of a human and a plasma- based intelligence who manage to survive to the time near the heat death of the universe. The book is thus a combined work in speculative cosmology and space colonization. Plot summary World at the End of Time follows the story of a young Earth-born human, Viktor Sorricaine, on a colony expedition to a distant star system. The colonists are frozen for the long trip between stars. Unknown to both the humans of Earth and the colonists, the stars around them are home to immensely long-lived (effectively immortal) plasma creatures‚Äîwith no knowledge of, or interest in, the activities of insignificant matter creatures. Wan-To, one of the oldest and most powerful plasma creatures, is engaged in a war. After creating modified copies of himself, or \\"children\\", for company, Wan-To finds himself in a deadly game of chess with them. The \\"board\\" is the entire galaxy and the weapons are the stars themselves. Each star may be home to an enemy \\"child\\"; using a variety of exotic particles, Wan-To is able to cause a targeted star to flare and kill any enemy that may be living within it. Some time after the colonists have left Earth, its own sun falls victim to the war, being made to explode with humanity on Earth being destroyed as a \\" collateral damage\\"; the colonists are thus the only humans left. Into the middle of this battlefield, the three colony ships (Ark, New Mayflower and Argosy) unwittingly head for their new home. Upon arriving, the colony begins to establish itself ... only to discover that their entire local group of stars appears to be undergoing a bizarre acceleration, and are dimming. After a disastrous disease outbreak and terraforming failures, the desperate colonists eventually decide to investigate the strange radiation emissions from a small world within their solar system. Upon arriving in orbit, their ship is badly damaged and Viktor is forced into the onboard freezer systems. They are eventually rescued and unfrozen four hundred of the colony's years later, to find the colony in an even more desperate situation. The star around which the colony's world orbits has dimmed considerably (due to the energy being siphoned off to accelerate it) and they are now travelling so fast that, due to relativistic effects, the universe around them has shrunk to a bright dot. The colony has become factionalized and heavily religious, with scientific investigation discouraged. Viktor is eventually frozen again for attempting to investigate why they have been accelerating. He wakes four thousand of the colony's years later, to find the far descendants of the colony have rebuilt their society into habitats closely orbiting the dim star (a brown dwarf) and created a high-technology civilization dedicated to pleasure and comfort. He makes his way, eventually, to the former colony to find only a few fellow-colonists unfrozen and attempting to rebuild it. His unique status as someone who was born on \\"old Earth\\" brings publicity to their efforts and the rebuilding forges ahead. During the four thousand years of Viktor's frozen sleep, the star system has been slowed again. After the vast amount of time that has passed, all that remains of the once young universe are dead stars and black holes, with Wan-To desperately surviving on the energy provided by proton decay. Wan-To receives a tachyon transmission from his long-forgotten systems and makes preparations to move into these last remaining stars ‚Äî believing that the small matter creatures inhabiting the system are irrelevant and can be destroyed should they become an irritation.

The early history of the Rigdonite movement is shared with the history of the Latter Day Saint movement, but as of the 1844 succession crisis becomes distinct. Sidney Rigdon and other church leaders, including Brigham Young and James J. Strang, presented themselves as leaders of the movement and established rival church organizations. Rigdon's group was initially headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was known at one point as the Church of Jesus Christ of the Children of Zion, and its adherents are referred to as Rigdonites, or sometimes \\"Pennsylvania Latter Day Saints\\" or \\"Pennsylvania Mormons.\\" The only surviving organization that traces its succession back to Rigdon's organization is The Church of Jesus Christ, founded by a group of Rigdon's followers led by William Bickerton. History Sidney Rigdon, who had been the first counselor in the First Presidency under Joseph Smith, claimed to have received a vision, after the death of Joseph Smith, sustaining him as the leader of the Church. Although Joseph Smith taught that after the president in a presidency is released or dies the presidency no longer exists, Rigdon overlooked this teaching and returned to attempt to convince the other saints that he was to be the leader of the church. Unconvinced, because the other members were familiar with Smith's teachings, Brigham Young presented the doctrine taught by Smith that aside from the first presidency, the quorum of the twelve apostles was the governing body of the church. Most Latter Day Saints followed Young as a result. Sidney Rigdon After the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, the history of the Rigdonites becomes independent from the other Latter Day Saint organizations. There was a large amount of confusion about who should succeed their slain prophet. Rigdon claimed the right to lead the church as the senior surviving member of the church's highest ruling body, the First Presidency. The Quorum of Twelve Apostles, led by Brigham Young, also claimed the right to lead the church. The Quorum of the Twelve's claim was derived from a revelation of Joseph Smith allowing them to stand equal to the First Presidency in attending to natural matters of the church. Prior to the death of Joseph Smith, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major decisions and led the Church of Christ both naturally and spiritually. On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon had been ordained by Joseph Smith as a \\"Prophet, Seer and Revelator\\"Earlier, on March 27, 1836, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith had asked the members of the church to accept the members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve as \\"prophets, seers, and revelators\\": see B.H. Roberts (ed), History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 2:417; see also Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate 2:277 .‚Äîwhich was one of the same ecclesiastical titles held by Smith. The Church of Jesus Christ maintains that as First Counselor to Smith, Rigdon should naturally have been the leader of the church after Smith's death. With this understanding, The Church of Jesus Christ disagrees that the Quorum of Twelve had the right to lead the church. The Church of Jesus Christ argues that Rigdon should have been allowed to be what he claimed to be ‚Äî a \\"guardian\\" over the church until proper proceedings could decide the next president ‚Äî and that proceedings which resulted in Brigham Young leading the church constituted a procedural violation. On December 27, 1847, when Young organized a new First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve only had seven of its twelve members present to represent a council to decide the Presidency.Nine members of the Quorum were in attendance, but only seven of the individuals were members of the Quorum on June 27, 1844, when Joseph Smith had died. Two members of the Quorum‚ÄîAmasa M. Lyman and Ezra T. Benson‚Äîhad been added by Young since Smith's death. William Smith, John E. Page, and Lyman Wight had previously denounced the proceedings and were not present. John Taylor and Parley P. Pratt were in the Salt Lake Valley and could not have known of the proceedings. This left just seven present, a majority of one meaning Young would have to vote for himself in order to gain a majority quorum vote in favor of his leadership. Young chose two of the other apostles, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards, as his counselors in the First Presidency. This left only four members of the Quorum of the Twelve, as recognized by Sidney, present to vote in favor of creation of the new First Presidency: Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and Orson Pratt. The Church of Jesus Christ views this action as a violation of church law compromising the authority of Sidney Rigdon without a majority quorum vote. The LDS Church does not agree with this view of the proceedings, as they recognize newly ordained apostles under Joseph Smith as authorized to offer a sustaining vote.The LDS Church maintains that Rigdon was validly excommunicated from the church by the Common Council of the Church on September 8, 1844: see History of the Church 7:268-69. The LDS Church further maintains that William Smith had been disfellowshipped and replaced in the Quorum by Amasa M. Lyman and that John E. Page had been excommunicated and replaced in the Quorum by Ezra T. Benson. Because Lyman and Benson were present at the 1847 reorganization, the LDS Church claims that nine of the nine present members of the Quorum voted in favor of reorganizing Young's First Presidency, which constituted a three-quarters majority vote of the Quorum. Undaunted, Rigdon relocated to Pittsburgh and established a rival organization of the church. Ebenezer Robinson, founding publisher of the Times and Seasons, became publisher of a new church periodical, the Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate, (later the Messenger and Advocate of the Church of Christ.) The Rigdonite paper, like the reformist Mormon paper before it, the Nauvoo Expositor sought to expose and condemn the practice of plural marriage. Church elder Benjamin Winchester commented that Young and the Quorum of the Twelve had: :\\"Excited a certain portion of the Church to reject Elder Rigdon (which is a most horrid outrage upon the laws of the same) from a fear that he would bring them to...justice for teaching and practicing the doctrine of polygamy.\\" The Rigdonites came to believe that Joseph Smith had become a fallen prophet when he began to practice polygamy and that, as a result the \\"Lord smote him for this thing ‚Äî cut him off from the earth.\\" (Messenger and Advocate, Jan. 1, 1845) Rigdon toured the eastern branches of the church in late 1844 and early 1845, gathering leaders to his cause. He was joined by former members of the First Presidency, John C. Bennett and William Law and also by former Apostle William E. McLellin. On April 6, 1845 ‚Äî fifteen years after the original organization of the church ‚Äî Rigdon presided over a General Conference of Rigdonite Latter Day Saints in Pittsburgh, establishing a new hierarchy. He himself was sustained as President of the Church. The new Quorum of the Twelve Apostles consisted of: William E. McLellin, George W. Robinson, Benjamin Winchester, James Blakeslee, Josiah Ells, Hugh Herringshaw, David L. Lathrop, Jeremiah Hatch, Jr., E.R. Swackhammer, William Small, Samuel Bennett. Carvel Rigdon became Presiding Patriarch, and a Standing High Council, Quorum of the Seventy, Presiding Bishopric, and other quorum presidencies were established. In addition, Rigdon called seventy-three men and boys to a \\"Grand Council,\\" perhaps an adaptation of the Council of Fifty. Also at the conference, the new church organization formally returned its name to the 1830 church's original name, the \\"Church of Christ.\\" At a General Conference held that fall in Philadelphia, Rigdon announced that the church would re-establish a communitarian society on what was named \\"Adventure Farm\\" near Greencastle, Pennsylvania. Like many attempts to live the Law of Consecration in the Latter Day Saint movement, this experiment proved a failure. Rigdonite apostles William E. McLellin and Benjamin Winchester grew disgusted with Rigdon's leadership and found a new church president and organization in the person of David Whitmer and the Church of Christ (Whitmerite). One of the replacements in the Quorum was William Bickerton. Bickerton, however, disagreed with Rigdon's proposed move to Greencastle and severed his ties to the Church. Bickerton remained in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, and never moved to Greencastle. By April 1847, the Adventure Farm community had collapsed and Rigdon had abandoned his flock, living out the rest of his life on the charity of relatives in New York state. Bickerton continued to live in the Monongahela area and in 1849 began meeting informally with other believers whom he had converted to the faith, few of which had ever been associated with Rigdon. In 1862, he formally organized his Pennsylvania followers into The Church of Jesus Christ. In January 1856, Stephen Post wrote to Rigdon about the disordered state of Mormonism, and in March Rigdon responded to Post's letter with a revelation commanding him to assist in reestablishing the Rigdonite organization. Post embraced Rigdon's prophetic claims and became an advocate of his cause, with an 1866 revelation designating him Rigdon's \\"spokesman.\\" Post's non-Mormon wife, Jane, converted to the Rigdonite church in 1865 and was ordained an elder in 1868. In 1871, Post was sent on a mission to Manitoba, Canada, where he spent the rest of his life. After Rigdon's death, Post succeeded him as leader of the church, but died three years later. In 1880, Andrew J. Hinckle was appointed President of the Church in his stead, but was replaced by Jane Post in 1882. After Jane Post's death, the remaining organization quickly collapsed.

Due to its regular antenna-like structure and upright position on the seafloor at a depth of , some proponents of fringe and UFO-related theories including Bruce Cathie have suggested that it might be an extraterrestrial artifact. Other authorities have suggested that the object photographed by the Eltanin was an unusual carnivorous sponge, Chondrocladia concrescens (formerly Cladorhiza concrescens). History The 1,850 ton displacement Eltanin was originally launched in 1957, and served with the US Navy as a cargo-carrying icebreaker. In 1962 she was reclassified as an Oceanographic Research Ship and became the world's first dedicated Antarctic research vessel, a role which she filled until 1975. On 29 August 1964, while engaged in taking sample cores and photographing the seabed west of Cape Horn, the Eltanin took the photograph reproduced in this article, at position 59:07'S 105:03'W, in a depth of 3,904 metres. The first public mention of the unusual subject of the photograph was a news item which appeared in the New Zealand Herald on 5 December 1964, under the heading \\"Puzzle Picture From Sea Bed\\". In 1968, author Brad Steiger wrote an article for Saga magazine, in which he claimed that the Eltanin had in fact photographed \\"an astonishing piece of machinery... very much like the cross between a TV antenna and a telemetry antenna\\".

Hollister had already identified the mysterious object as Cladorhiza concrescens, a carnivorous sponge. Heezen and Hollister's book reproduces the photograph taken by the USNS Eltanin and a redrawn version of a drawing by Alexander Agassiz which originally appeared in his 1988 Three Cruises of the Blake. Hollister and Heezen describe Cladorhiza concrescens as a sponge which \\"somewhat resembles a space-age microwave antenna\\", while Agassiz described the sponges as having \\"a long stem ending in ramifying roots, sunk deeply into the mud.

Early deployments of SBCs were focused on the borders between two service provider networks in a peering environment. This role has now expanded to include significant deployments between a service provider's access network and a backbone network to provide service to residential and/or enterprise customers. The term \\"session\\" refers to a communication between two parties ‚Äì in the context of telephony, this would be a call. Each call consists of one or more call signaling message exchanges that control the call, and one or more call media streams which carry the call's audio, video, or other data along with information of call statistics and quality. Together, these streams make up a session. It is the job of a session border controller to exert influence over the data flows of sessions. The term \\"border\\" refers to a point of demarcation between one part of a network and another. As a simple example, at the edge of a corporate network, a firewall demarcates the local network (inside the corporation) from the rest of the Internet (outside the corporation). A more complex example is that of a large corporation where different departments have security needs for each location and perhaps for each kind of data. In this case, filtering routers or other network elements are used to control the flow of data streams. It is the job of a session border controller to assist policy administrators in managing the flow of session data across these borders. The term \\"controller\\" refers to the influence that session border controllers have on the data streams that comprise sessions, as they traverse borders between one part of a network and another. Additionally, session border controllers often provide measurement, access control, and data conversion facilities for the calls they control.  Functions  SBCs commonly maintain full session state and offer the following functions: * Security ‚Äì protect the network and other devices from: ** Malicious attacks such as a denial-of-service attack (DoS) or distributed DoS ** Toll fraud via rogue media streams ** Malformed packet protection ** Encryption of signaling (via TLS and IPSec) and media (SRTP) * Connectivity ‚Äì allow different parts of the network to communicate through the use of a variety of techniques such as: ** NAT traversal ** SIP normalization via SIP message and header manipulation ** IPv4 to IPv6 interworking ** VPN connectivity ** Protocol translations between SIP, SIP-I, H.323 * Quality of service ‚Äì the QoS policy of a network and prioritization of flows is usually implemented by the SBC. It can include such functions as: ** Traffic policing ** Resource allocation ** Rate limiting ** Call admission control ** ToS/DSCP bit setting * Regulatory ‚Äì many times the SBC is expected to provide support for regulatory requirements such as: ** emergency calls prioritization and ** lawful interception * Media services ‚Äì many of the new generation of SBCs also provide built-in digital signal processors (DSPs) to enable them to offer border-based media control and services such as: ** DTMF relay and interworking ** Media transcoding ** Tones and announcements ** Data and fax interworking ** Support for voice and video calls * Statistics and billing information ‚Äì since all sessions that pass through the edge of the network pass through the SBC, it is a natural point to gather statistics and usage-based information on these sessions. With the advent of WebRTC some SBCs have also assumed the role of SIP to WebRTC Gateway and translate SIP. While no one signalling protocol is mandated by the WebRTC specifications,How WebRTC Is Revolutionizing Telephony. Blogs.trilogy-lte.com (2014-02-21). Retrieved on 2014-04-11. SIP over WebSockets (RFC 7118) is often used partially due to the applicability of SIP to most of the envisaged communication scenarios as well as the availability of open source software such as JsSIP. In such a case the SBC acts as a gateway between the WebRTC applications and SIP end points. Applications SBCs are inserted into the signaling and/or media paths between calling and called parties in a VoIP call, predominantly those using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, and MGCP call-signaling protocols. In many cases the SBC hides the network topology and protects the service provider or enterprise packet networks. The SBC terminates an inbound call and initiates the second call leg to the destination party. In technical terms, when used with the SIP protocol, this defines a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA). The effect of this behavior is that not only the signaling traffic, but also the media traffic (voice, video) is controlled by the SBC. In cases where the SBC does not have the capability to provide media services, SBCs are also able to redirect media traffic to a different element elsewhere in the network, for recording, generation of music-on-hold, or other media-related purposes. Conversely, without an SBC, the media traffic travels directly between the endpoints, without the in-network call signaling elements having control over their path. In other cases, the SBC simply modifies the stream of call control (signaling) data involved in each call, perhaps limiting the kinds of calls that can be conducted, changing the codec choices, and so on. Ultimately, SBCs allow the network operators to manage the calls that are made on their networks, fix or change protocols and protocol syntax to achieve interoperability, and also overcome some of the problems that firewalls and network address translators (NATs) present for VoIP calls. To show the operation of an SBC, one can compare a simple call establishment sequence with a call establishment sequence with an SBC. In the simplest session establishment sequence with only one proxy between the user agents the proxy‚Äôs task is to identify the callee‚Äôs location and forward the request to it. The proxy also adds a Via header with its own address to indicate the path that the response should traverse. The proxy does not change any dialog identification information present in the message such as the tag in the From header, the Call-Id or the Cseq. Proxies also do not alter any information in the SIP message bodies. Note that during the session initiation phase the user agents exchange SIP messages with the SDP bodies that include addresses at which the agents expect the media traffic. After successfully finishing the session initiation phase the user agents can exchange the media traffic directly between each other without the involvement of the proxy. SBCs are designed for many applications and are used by operators and enterprises to achieve a variety of goals. Even the same SBC implementation might act differently depending on its configuration and the use case. Hence, it is not easily possible to describe an exact SBC behavior that would apply to all SBC implementations. In general it is possible to identify certain features that are common to SBCs. For example, most SBCs are implemented as back-to-back user agent. A B2BUA is a proxy-like server that splits a SIP transaction in two call legs: on the side facing the user agent client (UAC), it acts as server, on the side facing user agent server (UAS) it acts as a client. While a proxy usually keeps only state information related to active transactions, B2BUAs keep state information about active dialogs, e.g., calls. That is, once a proxy receives a SIP request it will save some state information. Once the transaction is over, e.g., after receiving a response, the state information will soon after be deleted. A B2BUA will maintain state information for active calls and only delete this information once the call is terminated. When an SBC is included in the call path, the SBC acts as a B2BUA that behaves as a user agent server towards the caller and as user agent client towards the callee. In this sense, the SBC actually terminates that call that was generated by the caller and starts a new call towards the callee. The INVITE message sent by the SBC contains no longer a clear reference to the caller. The INVITE sent by the SBC to the proxy includes Via and Contact headers that point to the SBC itself and not the caller. SBCs often also manipulate the dialog identification information listed in the Call-Id and From tag. Further, in case the SBC is configured to also control the media traffic then the SBC also changes the media addressing information included in the c and m lines of the SDP body. Thereby, not only will all SIP messages traverse the SBC but also all audio and video packets. As the INVITE sent by the SBC establishes a new dialog, the SBC also manipulates the message sequence number (CSeq) as well the Max-Forwards value. Note that the list of header manipulations listed here is only a subset of the possible changes that an SBC might introduce to a SIP message. Furthermore, some SBCs might not do all of the listed manipulations. If the SBC is not expected to control the media traffic then there might be no need to change anything in the SDP header. Some SBCs do not change the dialog identification information and others might even not change the addressing information. SBCs are often used by corporations along with firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to enable VoIP calls to and from a protected enterprise network. VoIP service providers use SBCs to allow the use of VoIP protocols from private networks with Internet connections using NAT, and also to implement strong security measures that are necessary to maintain a high quality of service. SBCs also replace the function of application-level gateways. In larger enterprises, SBCs can also be used in conjunction with SIP trunks to provide call control and make routing/policy decisions on how calls are routed through the LAN/WAN. There are often tremendous cost savings associated with routing traffic through the internal IP networks of an enterprise, rather than routing calls through a traditional circuit-switched phone network. Additionally, some SBCs can allow VoIP calls to be set up between two phones using different VoIP signaling protocols (e.g., SIP, H.323, Megaco/MGCP) as well as performing transcoding of the media stream when different codecs are in use. Most SBCs also provide firewall features for VoIP traffic (denial of service protection, call filtering, bandwidth management). Protocol normalization and header manipulation is also commonly provided by SBCs, enabling communication between different vendors and networks. From an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) architecture perspective, the SBC is the integration of the P-CSCF and IMS-ALG at the signaling plane and the IMS Access Gateway at the media plane on the access side. On the interconnect side, the SBC maps to the IBCF, IWF at the signaling plane and TrGW (Transition Gateway) at the media plane. From an IMS/TISPAN architecture perspective, the SBC is the integration of the P-CSCF and C-BGF functions on the access side, and the IBCF, IWF, THIG, and I-BGF functions on the peering side. Some SBCs can be \\"decomposed\\", meaning the signaling functions can be located on a separate hardware platform than the media relay functions ‚Äì in other words the P-CSCF can be separated from the C-BGF, or the IBCF/IWF can be separated from the I-BGF functions physically. Standards-based protocol, such as the H.248 Ia profile, can be used by the signaling platform to control the media one while a few SBCs use proprietary protocols. Controversy During its infancy, the concept of SBC was controversial to proponents of end-to-end systems and peer- to-peer networking because: * SBCs can extend the length of the media path (the way of media packets through the network) significantly. A long media path is undesirable, as it increases the delay of voice packets and the probability of packet loss. Both effects deteriorate the voice/video quality. However, many times there are obstacles to communication such as firewalls between the call parties, and in these cases SBCs offer an efficient method to guide media streams towards an acceptable path between caller and callee; without the SBC the call media would be blocked. Some SBCs can detect if the ends of the call are in the same subnetwork and release control of the media enabling it to flow directly between the clients, this is anti-tromboning or media release. Also, some SBCs can create a media path where none would otherwise be allowed to exist (by virtue of various firewalls and other security apparatus between the two endpoints). Lastly, for specific VoIP network models where the service provider owns the network, SBCs can actually decrease the media path by shortcut routing approaches. For example, a service provider that provides trunking services to several enterprises would usually allocate each enterprise a VPN. It is often desirable to have the option to interconnect the VPN through SBCs. A VPN-aware SBC may perform this function at the edge of the VPN network, rather than sending all the traffic to the core. * SBCs has the potential to restrict the flow of information between call endpoints, restricting end-to-end transparency. VoIP phones may not be able to use new protocol features unless they are understood by the SBC. However, the SBCs are usually able to cope with the majority of new, and unanticipated protocol features. * Sometimes end-to-end encryption can't be used if the SBC does not have the key, although some portions of the information stream in an encrypted call are not encrypted, and those portions can be used and influenced by the SBC. However, the new generations of SBCs, armed with sufficient computing capacity, are able to offload this encryption function from other elements in the network by terminating SIP-TLS, IPsec, and/or SRTP. Furthermore, SBCs can actually make calls and other SIP scenarios work when they couldn't have before, by performing specific protocol \\"normalization\\" or \\"fix-up\\". * In most cases, far-end or hosted NAT traversal can be done without SBCs if the VoIP phones support protocols like STUN, TURN, ICE, or Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Most of the controversy surrounding SBCs pertains to whether call control should remain solely with the two endpoints in a call (in service to their owners), or should rather be shared with other network elements owned by the organizations managing various networks involved in connecting the two call endpoints. For example, should call control remain with Alice and Bob (two callers), or should call control be shared with the operators of all the IP networks involved in connecting Alice and Bob's VoIP phones together. The debate of this point was vigorous, almost religious, in nature. Those who wanted unfettered control in the endpoints only, were also greatly frustrated by the various realities of modern networks, such as firewalls and filtering/throttling. On the other side, network operators are typically concerned about overall network performance, interoperability and quality, and want to ensure it is secure. Lawful intercept and CALEA An SBC may provide session media (usually RTP) and signaling (often SIP) wiretap services, which can be used by providers to enforce requests for the lawful interception of network sessions. Standards for the interception of such services are provided by ATIS, TIA, CableLabs and ETSI, among others. History and market According to Jonathan Rosenberg, the author of RFC 3261 (SIP) and numerous other related RFCs, Dynamicsoft developed the first working SBC in conjunction with Aravox, but the product never truly gained marketshare. . Newport Networks was the first to have an IPO on the London Stock Exchange's AIM in May 2004 (NNG), while Cisco has been publicly traded since 1990. Acme Packet followed in October 2006 by floating on the NASDAQ. With the field narrowed by acquisition, NexTone merged with Reefpoint becoming Nextpoint, which was subsequently acquired in 2008 by Genband. At this same time, there emerged the ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù SBC where the border control function was integrated into another edge device. In 2009, Ingate Systems‚Äô Firewall became the first SBC to earn certification from ICSA Labs, a milestone in certifying the VoIP security capabilities of an SBC. The continuing growth of VoIP networks pushes SBCs further to the edge, mandating adaptation in capacity and complexity. As the VoIP network grows and traffic volume increases, more and more sessions are passing through SBC. Vendors are addressing these new scale requirements in a variety of ways. Some have developed separate, load balancing systems to sit in front of SBC clusters. Others, have developed new architectures using the latest generation chipsets offering higher performance SBCs and scalability using service cards.

Unlike other common climbing hitches, which often use a loop of cord, the Blake's hitch is formed using the end of a rope. Although it is a stable knot, it is often backed up with a stopper knot, such as a figure-of-eight knot, for safety. It is used for both ascending and descending, and is preferred by many arborists over other hitches, such as the taut-line hitch, as it is less prone to binding. History The first known presentation of this knot was made by Heinz Prohaska in an Austrian guides periodical in 1981; in 1990, he presented it in a caving journal, Nylon Highway. Separately, Jason Blake discovered the knot for himself and presented it to the arborist community in a letter to Arbor Age in 1994, after which it was enthusiastically adopted by arborists. It has since become well known under the name \\"Blake's hitch\\". Usage This hitch has two conventional forms -- the 4/2 and the 5/3 -- although other variations are possible. The 5/3 version has the tail pass up through the bottom three turns of the coil which has five total turns. In the 4/2 version the tail passes up through two of the four coils. The hitch is dressed and set tight enough to provide enough grip for the applied load without being tighter than necessary. This hitch is most commonly used with 12-13mm (1/2 inch) static climbing ropes. (Heinz has advised that where slippage of the base, \\"4/2\\" knot seems to result from extra slippery rope(s), add a turn to the away end (i.e., that end beyond the tucked tail); if slippage seems to result from rope stiffness, add a turn at the near end, resulting in the \\"5/3\\".)  Tying  In practice it helps to insert the thumb under the lower turns since this facilitates threading the tail in later. After passing the tail round the standing end, the tail then must pass back behind the standing line and up through the desired number of turns of the coil. A stopper knot is then added to the dangling tail to prevent any chance of it pulling out.

Knopf) Doctor Faustus is a German novel written by Thomas Mann, begun in 1943 and published in 1947 as Doktor Faustus: Das Leben des deutschen Tonsetzers Adrian Leverk√ºhn, erz√§hlt von einem Freunde (\\"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverk√ºhn, Told by a Friend\\"). Outline First edition cover (jacket) in Europe The novel is a re-shaping of the Faust legend set in the context of the first half of the 20th century and the turmoil of Germany in that period. The story centers on the life and work of the (fictitious) composer Adrian Leverk√ºhn. The narrator is Leverk√ºhn's childhood friend Serenus Zeitblom, who writes in Germany between 1943 and 1946. Leverk√ºhn's extraordinary intellect and creativity as a young man mark him as destined for success, but his ambition is for true greatness. He strikes a Faustian bargain for creative genius: he intentionally contracts syphilis, which deepens his artistic inspiration through madness. He is subsequently visited by a Mephistophelean being (who says, in effect, \\"that you can only see me because you are mad, does not mean that I do not really exist\\"The scene is strongly reminiscent of Ivan Karamazov's breakdown in Dostoevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov.), and, renouncing love, bargains his soul in exchange for twenty-four years of genius. His madness ‚Äì his daemonic inspiration ‚Äì leads to extraordinary musical creativity (which parallels the actual innovations of Arnold Schoenberg). Leverk√ºhn's last creative years are increasingly haunted by his obsession with the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment. He feels the inexorable progress of his neuro- syphilitic madness leading towards complete breakdown. As in certain of the Faust legends, he calls together his closest friends to witness his final collapse. At a chamber-reading of his cantata \\"The Lamentation of Doctor Faust\\", he ravingly confesses his demonic pact before becoming incoherent. His madness reduces him to an infantile state in which he lives under the care of his relatives for another ten years. Leverk√ºhn's life unfolds in the context of, and in parallel with, the German cultural and political environment which led to the rise and downfall of Nazi Germany. But the predisposing conditions for Leverk√ºhn's pact with the devil are set in character, and in the artistic life, the artistic processes themselves, not merely as political allegory. The interplay of layers between the narrator's historical situation, the progress of Leverk√ºhn's madness, and the medieval legends with which Leverk√ºhn consciously connects himself makes for an overwhelmingly rich symbolic network, an ambiguous complexity that cannot be reduced to a single interpretation. Plot The origins of the narrator and the protagonist in the fictitious small town of Kaisersaschern on the Saale, the name of Zeitblom's apothecary father, Wohlgemut, and the description of Adrian Leverk√ºhn as an old-fashioned German type, with a cast of features \\"from a time before the Thirty Years' War\\", evoke the old post-medieval Germany. In their respective Catholic and Lutheran origins, and theological studies, they are heirs to the German Renaissance and the world of D√ºrer and Bach, but sympathetic to, and admired by, the \\"keen-scented receptivity of Jewish circles\\". They are awakened to musical knowledge by Wendell Kretzschmar, a German American lecturer and musicologist who visits Kaisersaschern. After schooling together, both boys study at Halle ‚Äì Adrian studies theology; Zeitblom does not, but participates in discussions with the theological students ‚Äì but Adrian becomes absorbed in musical harmony, counterpoint and polyphony as a key to metaphysics and mystic numbers, and follows Kretzschmar to Leipzig to study with him. Zeitblom describes \\"with a religious shudder\\" Adrian's embrace with the woman who gave him syphilis (whom Adrian names \\"Esmeralda\\" after the butterfly that fascinates his father), how he worked her name in note-ciphers into his compositions, and how the medics who sought to heal him were all prevented from effecting a cure by mysterious and deadly interventions. Zeitblom begins to perceive the demonic, as Adrian develops other friendships, first with the translator R√ºdiger Schildknapp, and then after his move to Munich with the handsome young violinist Rudi Schwerdtfeger, Frau Rodde and her doomed daughters Clarissa and Ines, a numismatist named Dr. Kranich, and two artists named Leo Zink and Baptist Spengler. Zeitblom insists, however, on the unique closeness of his own relationship to Adrian, for he remains the only person whom the composer addresses by the familiar pronoun.The use of 'Du' (for 'You') signified an intimate friendship. Adrian meets the Schweigestill family at Pfeiffering in the country an hour from Munich, which later becomes his permanent home and retreat. While a fictional town, Mann based Pfeiffering on the actual Bavarian town of Polling. He lives at Palestrina in Italy with SchildknappIn reality Thomas Mann lived at Palestrina in around 1930 with his brother Heinrich. in 1912, and Zeitblom visits them. It is there that Adrian, working on music for an operatic adaptation of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost, has his long dialogue with a Mephistopheles figure who appears either objectively or out of his own afflicted soul. In these central pages, the fulcrum of the story, Zeitblom presents Adrian's manuscript of the conversation. The demon, speaking in archaic German, claims Esmeralda as the instrument by which he entraps Adrian and offers him twenty-four years' life as a genius ‚Äì the supposed incubation period of his syphilis ‚Äì if he will now renounce the warmth of love. The dialogue reveals the anatomy of Leverk√ºhn's thought. Adrian then moves permanently to Pfeiffering, and in conversations with Zeitblom confesses a darker view of life. Figures of a demonic type appear, such as Dr. Chaim Breisacher, to cast down the idols of the older generation. In 1915, Ines Rodde marries, but forms an adulterous love for Rudi Schwerdtfeger. Adrian begins to experience illnesses of retching, headaches and migraines, but is producing new and finer music, preparing the way for his great work, the oratorio Apocalypsis cum Figuris ('The Apocalypse with Figures''Figurae' in Latin possibly in the sense of 'vehicles of allusion'; or, of 'Spirits'; or, of 'Depictions' or 'Types'.). Schwerdtfeger woos himself into Adrian's solitude, asking for a violin concerto that would be like the offspring of their platonic union. By August 1919 Adrian has completed the sketch of Apocalypsis. There is also a new circle of intellectual friends, including Sextus Kridwiss, the art-expert; Chaim Breisacher; Dr. Egon Unruhe, the palaeozoologist; Georg Vogler, a literary historian; Dr. Holzschuher, a D√ºrer scholar; and the saturnine poet Daniel zur H√∂he. In their discussions they declare the need for the renunciation of bourgeois softness and a preparation for an age of pre-medieval harshness. Adrian writes to Zeitblom that collectivism is the true antithesis of Bourgeois culture; Zeitblom observes that aestheticism is the herald of barbarism. Apocalypsis is performed in Frankfurt in 1926 under Otto Klemperer with 'Erbe' as the St. John narrator. Zeitblom describes the work as filled with longing without hope, with hellish laughter transposed and transfigured even into the searing tones of spheres and angels. Adrian, producing the concerto which Rudi solicited, attempts to evade his contract and obtain a wife by employing Rudi as the messenger of his love. She however prefers Rudi himself, and not Adrian. Soon afterwards Rudi is shot dead in a tram by Ines out of jealousy. As Adrian begins to plan the second oratorio The Lamentation of Doctor Faustus, in 1928, his sister's child Nepomuk is sent to live with him. The boy, who calls himself \\"Echo\\", is beloved by all. As the work of gigantic dimensions develops in Adrian's mind, the child falls ill and dies, and Adrian, despairing, believes that by gazing at him with love, in violation of his contract, he has killed him with poisonous and hellish influences. The score of the Lamentation is completed in 1930, Adrian summons his friends and guests, and instead of playing the music he relates the story of his infernal contract, and descends into the brain disease which lasts until his death ten years later. Zeitblom visits him occasionally, and survives to witness the collapse of Germany's \\"dissolute triumphs\\" as he tells the story of his friend. Sources and origins Mann published his own account of the genesis of the novel in 1949.Mann, Thomas. Die Entstehung des Doktor Faustus, Roman eines Romanes (S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 1949): as The Story of a Novel: The Genesis of Doctor Faustus, translated by Richard Winston and Clara Winston (Alfred Knopf, New York 1961). The novel's title and themes are inseparable in German literature from its highest dramatical expression in the Faust I and Faust II of the poet Goethe, and declares Mann's intention to address his subject in the light of that profound, authentic exploration and depiction of the German character. Yet the relationship is indirect, the Faustian aspect of Leverk√ºhn's character being paralleled in the abnormal circumstances surrounding Nazism. Helen Lowe- Porter, the novel's first English translator, wrote of its themes, > Readers of Faustus will and must be involved, with shudders, in all three > strands of the book: the German scene from within, and its broader, its > universal origins; the depiction of an art not German alone but vital to our > whole civilization; music as one instance of the arts and the state in which > the arts find themselves today [sc. 1949]; and, finally, the invocation of > the daemonic. T. Mann, Doctor Faustus, First England Edition (Secker and > Warburg, London 1949), Translator's note, p. vi. Nietzsche The trajectory of Leverk√ºhn's career is modeled partly upon the life of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900). From his supposed contraction of syphilis to his complete mental collapse in 1889 proclaiming the Anti-Christ, and his death in 1900, Nietzsche's life presents a celebrated example imitated in Leverk√ºhn. (The illnesses of Delius and Wolf also resonate, as does the death of Mahler's child after he had tempted fate (as Alma Mahler thought) by setting the Kindertotenlieder.) Nietzsche's 1871 work The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music, presents the theme that the evolution of Art is bound up with the duality of the Apollonian and Dionysian Hellenic impulses,rendering '... die Fortentwickelung der Kunst an die Duplicit√§t des Apollonischen und des Dionysischen gebunden ist': Nietzsche, Friedrich. Die Geburt der Trag√∂die aus dem Geiste der Musik (1871), in Nietzsche's Werke. Taschen-Ausgabe Band I (C.G. Naumann Verlag, Leipzig 1906), p. 51. which the novel illuminates. Perhaps the 'serene' Zeitblom and the tragical Leverkuhn personify such a duality between impulses towards reasoned, contemplative progress, and those toward passion and tragic destiny, within character or creativity in the context of German society.Compare the roles of Settembrini and Naphta in Mann's novel The Magic Mountain. Mann wrote, \\"Zeitblom is a parody of myself. Adrian's mood is closer to my own than one might ‚Äì and ought to ‚Äì think.\\" Guidance Theodor Adorno acted as Mann's adviser and encouraged him to rewrite large sections of the book. Mann also read chapters to groups of invited friends (a method also used by Kafka) to test the effect of the text. In preparation for the work, Mann studied musicology and biographies of major composers including Mozart, Beethoven, Hector Berlioz, Hugo Wolf, Franz Schreker and Alban Berg. He communicated with living composers, including Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler. In Chapter XXII Leverk√ºhn develops the twelve-tone technique or row system, which was actually invented by Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg lived near Mann in Los Angeles as the novel was being written. He was very annoyed by this appropriation without his consent, and later editions of the novel included an Author's Note at the end acknowledging that the technique was Schoenberg's invention, and that passages of the book dealing with musical theory are indebted in many details to Schoenberg's Harmonielehre.A. Schoenberg, Harmonielehre (first published 1911). 3rd edition (Vienna: Universal Edition 1922). Translation by Roy E. Carter, based on the third edn., as Theory of Harmony (Berkeley, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978). . Models for the composer-legend Leverk√ºhn's projected work The Lamentation of Dr Faustus echoes the name of Ernst Krenek's Lamentatio Jeremiae prophetae, an oratorio of 1941‚Äì1942 which combines the Schoenbergian twelve-tone technique with modal counterpoint. As a model for the composer- legend Mann was strongly aware of Hans Pfitzner's opera Palestrina, premiered at Munich in 1917. Leverk√ºhn's preoccupation with polyphonic theory draws on the opera's theme of how the composer Palestrina sought to preserve polyphonic composition in his Missa Papae Marcelli. The tenor Karl Erb (also very famous as Evangelist narrator in Bach's St. Matthew Passion) created the role in Pfitzner's opera, and the singer-narrator in Leverk√ºhn's Apocalysis cum Figuris is named 'Erbe' (meaning 'heritage', i.e. inheritor of the tradition) in reference to him. Two other German operas of the time, the Berlin-based Ferruccio Busoni's Doktor Faust (left unfinished in 1924), and Paul Hindemith's Mathis der Maler (about Matthias Gr√ºnewald), completed 1935,Claire Taylor-Jay, The Artist-Operas of Pfitzner, Krenek, and Hindemith: Politics and the Ideology of the Artist, Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004. similarly explore the isolation of the creative individual,D. Fischer-Dieskau, 'Reflections on \\"Palestrina\\"', in Insert to Hans Piftzner, Palestrina, Raphael Kubelik (Polydor International, 1973). presenting the ethical, spiritual and artistic crises of the early 20th century through their roots in the German Protestant Reformation. Naming Throughout the work personal names are used allusively to reflect the paths of German culture from its medieval roots. For examples, Zeitblom's father Wohlgemut has the resonance of the artist Michael Wohlgemuth, teacher of Albrecht D√ºrer. Wendell Kretzschmar, the man who awakens them to music, probably hints at Hermann Kretzschmar, musical analyst, whose 'Guides to the Concert Hall' were widely read. The doomed child's name Nepomuk, in the 19th century quite popular in Austria and southern Germany, recalls the composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel and the playwright Johann Nestroy. Reflecting the (Counter-Reformation) cult of John Nepomuk, it therefore also evokes the high rococo, the 're-echoing of movement', in the St John Nepomuk Church architecture by the Asam brothers in Munich, and probably the descriptions and interpretations of it by Heinrich W√∂lfflin.H. W√∂lfflin, Principles of Art History 1915: Ch. 1, 'Architecture. The character of the violinist Rudi Schwerdtfeger is modelled on Paul Ehrenberg of Dresden, an admired friend of Mann's. But in general the characters and names echo philosophies and intellectual standpoints without intending portraits or impersonations of real individuals. They serve the many-layered, multi-valent allusiveness of Mann's style to underpin and reinforce the symbolic nature of his work. Themes As a re-telling of the Faust myth, the novel is concerned with themes such as pride, temptation, the cost of greatness, loss of humanity and so on. Another concern is with the intellectual fall of Germany in the time leading up to World War II. Leverk√ºhn's own moods and ideology mimic the change from humanism to irrational nihilism found in Germany's intellectual life in the 1930s. Leverk√ºhn becomes increasingly corrupt of body and of mind, ridden by syphilis and insanity. In the novel, all of these thematic threads ‚Äì Germany's intellectual fall, Leverk√ºhn's spiritual fall, and the physical corruption of his body ‚Äì directly correspond to the national disaster of fascist Germany. In Mann's published version of his 1938 United States lecture tour, The Coming Victory of Democracy, he said, \\"I must regretfully own that in my younger years I shared that dangerous German habit of thought which regards life and intellect, art and politics as totally separate worlds.\\" He now realised that they were inseparable. In Doktor Faustus, Leverk√ºhn's personal history, his artistic development, and the shifting German political climate are tied together by the narrator Zeitblom as he feels out and worries over the moral health of his nation (just as he had worried over the spiritual health of his friend, Leverk√ºhn). Adaptations * Franz Seitz's 1982 adaptation of the novel for West German television starred Jon Finch as Adrian Leverk√ºhn. ** Alexander Sokurov's film Faust (2011) English translations * H. T. Lowe-Porter translated many of Mann's works, including Doctor Faustus, almost contemporaneously with their composition. Mann completed Doctor Faustus in 1947, and in 1948 Alfred A. Knopf published Lowe-Porter's English translation. The translator in her note remarked 'Grievous difficulties do indeed confront anyone essaying the role of copyist to this vast canvas, this cathedral of a book, this woven tapestry of symbolism.' She described her translation as 'a version which cannot lay claim to being beautiful, though in every intent it is deeply faithful.' She employed medieval English vocabulary and phrasing to correspond with those sections of the text in which characters speak in Early New High German. * John E.

The league was founded in 1997 and began play in the Fall of that year. The league used to have its own season during the off-season of the WNBA. During the off-season, some WNBA players would play in the NWBL, while some would choose to play overseas. The league ceased operations in 2007. History In contrast to the ABL, WBA, and the WNBA before it, the NWBL was founded to govern a competitive amateur league for women. The NWBL was founded in 1997, in the shadow of both the ABL and the WNBA. The league is considered to be the brainchild of Patrick Alexander and Kevin Szotkowski, who saw the rapid growth of women's athletics of the time and decided to go into the business of promoting women athletes. With the assistance of former college basketball players and NWBL co-founders Jolynn Schneider and Jeanine Michealsen, Alexander and Szotkowski launched an aggressive marketing campaign in the Fall of 1997 to recruit players and teams. Although the recruitment campaign was not without its problems (including the death of Nick Johnson, co-founder of the marketing firm behind the league), the NWBL enrolled four teams by November and held its first championship series in December 1997. The first four teams enrolled were the San Diego Waves (considered to be the first NWBL team), the Columbus Lady Blazers, the Washington DC Defenders and the Long Beach Lightning. By the end of 2000, the league grew to encompass 600 players in 15 states and 26 cities. The 2001 season was the first season for the NWBL Pro League, which now serves as the primary organization for the NWBL. The first four teams in the newly formed league were the Atlanta Justice, the Birmingham Power, the Mobile Majesty and the Kansas City Legacy. The league managed to finish its first season in April 2001 when the Atlanta Justice won the 1st NWBL Pro Cup. Since 2001, the NWBL Pro League has played host to such WNBA stars as Sheryl Swoopes, Sue Bird, Tamika Catchings and Becky Hammon. The league folded in 2007, and since then the WNBA and WBA have been the only Women's Professional leagues in the United States.

The entries span the years from AD 431 to AD 1540. The entries up to AD 1489 were compiled in the late 15th century by the scribe Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Luin√≠n, under his patron Cathal √ìg Mac Maghnusa on the island of Belle Isle on Lough Erne in the kingdom of Fermanagh. Later entries (up to AD 1540) were added by others. Entries up to the mid-6th century are retrospective, drawing on earlier annalistic and historical texts, while later entries were contemporary, based on recollection and oral history. T. M. Charles-Edwards has claimed that the main source for its records of the first millennium A.D. is a now lost Armagh continuation of the Chronicle of Ireland. The Annals used the Irish language, with some entries in Latin. Because the Annals copied its sources verbatim, they are useful not just for historians, but also for linguists studying the evolution of the Irish language. A century later, the Annals of Ulster became an important source for the authors of the Annals of the Four Masters. It also informs the Irish text Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib. The Library of Trinity College Dublin possesses the original manuscript; the Bodleian Library in Oxford has a contemporary copy that fills some of the gaps in the original. There are two main modern English translations of the annals ‚Äì Mac Airt and Mac Niocaill (1983) and MacCarthy (1893). Content=Kings Several kings are mentioned throughout the Annals of Ulster. The Annals tend to follow the lives of the kings, including important battles, raids, and their ultimate death. Between the years of 847 and 879, three different kings are highlighted. For example: M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid, the king of the southern Ui Neill clan from 846‚Äì862: *839.6 ‚Äì First mentioned in the Annals of Ulster having killed Crunnmael son of Fiannamail. *841.2 ‚Äì Kills Diarmait *843.1 ‚Äì Mael Sechnaill's father, Mael Ruanaid, dies *845.7 ‚Äì Kills his brother Flann *845.8 ‚Äì Takes Tuirg√©is prisoner *846.7 ‚Äì Suffers heavy losses at hands of Tigernach *847.2 ‚Äì Begins his reign. *847.3 ‚Äì Destroys the Island of Loch Muinremor *848.4 ‚Äì defeats Vikings at Forach *849.12 ‚Äì conducts siege in Crupat *850.3 ‚Äì Cinaed, king of Cianacht, with help from foreign forces rebels against Mael Sechnaill *851.2 ‚Äì kills Cinaed, king of Cianacht *851.5 ‚Äì attends a conference in Ard Macha *854.2 ‚Äì took hostages from Mumu at Inne√≥in na nD√©ise *856.2 ‚Äì took hostages from Mumu at Caisel *856.3 ‚Äì battle against the Vikings *858.4 ‚Äì marched against Mumu, took hostages from them and travelled with them \\"from Belat Gabr√°in to Inis Tarbnai off the Irish coast, and from D√∫n Cermna to √Åra Airthir.\\" *859.3 ‚Äì attends a conference at R√°ith Aeda Meic Bric \\"to make peace and amity between the men of Ireland\\" *860.1 ‚Äì leads army into the north, attacked, but hold position *862.5 ‚Äì Dies and is described as \\"king of all Ireland\\" The same pattern is followed for Aed mac Neill, the king of the northern Ui Neill clan. Aed mac Neill appears in the following entries in the Annals of Ulster: 855.3, 856.5, 860.1, 861.1, 862.2, 862.3, 863.2, 864.1, 864.3, 866.4, 868.4, 870.2, 874.4, and finally 879.1 The final entry ends with the entry about his death and includes a poem. It reads \\"Aed son of Niall, king of Temair, fell asleep on the twelfth of the Kalends of 20 December Nov at Druim Inasclainn in the territory of Conaille. 1\\\\. (Twelve days before the melodious Kalends Of December‚Äîa harsh company‚Äî A wonderful person died to your loss(?), Aed of Ailech, over-king of the Irish. 2\\\\. A generous prudent man of shields Who brought plenty to landed Temair, Against iron-tipped spears a buckler From the forge-fire of the land of the sons of Mil.)\\" Just as with the Irish kings, the Annals of Ulster follows the lives of the Viking kings of Dublin. For example, Amla√≠b Conung (Olaf Konung) is mentioned in the following entries: 853.2, 857.1, 859.2, 863.4, 864.2, 866.1, 867.8, 869.6, 870.6, 871.2, and 875.4 The final entry deviates from the Irish kings and instead tells of the death of Amlaib‚Äôs son, Oist√≠n and reads: \\"Oist√≠n son of Amla√≠b, king of the Norsemen, was deceitfully killed by Albann.\\" Places Along with kings and kingdoms, the entries in the Annals of Ulster focus on important places of Ireland such as Armagh, the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland which appears several times throughout the text. Dublin for example, referred to in the text as either √Åth Cliath or Duiblinn, is described in the Annals of Ulster with entries ranging from the settlement of Dublin by Vikings (\\"The heathens still at Duiblinn\\" in 842.2 and \\"An encampment of the foreigners of √Åth Cliath at Cluain Andobuir\\" in 845.12) to deaths of notable names (\\"Carlus son of Conn son of Donnchad was killed in √Åth Cliath\\" in 960.2) to Dublin being ruled by the Irish (\\"The foreigners returned to √Åth Cliath and gave hostages to Brian\\" in 1000.4). The town appears 66 different times in the Annals of Ulster and can be found in the following entries: 770.1, 790.2, 841.4, 842.2, 842.7, 845.12, 851.3, 870.2, 871.2 893.4, 895.6, 902.2, 917.4, 919.3, 920.5, 921.5, 921.8, 924.3, 926.6, 927.3, 930.1, 936.2, 938.5, 938.6, 939.1, 942.3, 942.7, 944.3, 945.6, 946.1, 947.1, 950.7, 951.3, 951.7, 956.3, 960.2, 961.1, 978.3, 980.1, 994.6, 995.2, 999.8, 1000.4, 1013.12, 1013.13, 1014.2, 1018.2, 1021.1, 1022.4, 1031.2, 1035.5, 1070.2, 1075.1, 1075.4, 1084.8, 1088.4, 1094.2, 1095.4, 1100.5, 1103.5, 1105.3, 1115.4, 1118.6, 1121.7, 1126.7, and 1128.6  Historical context =Vikings in Ireland The Annals of Ulster contains a large amount of historical information on the invasions of the Vikings into Ireland and several specific events are mentioned that are paralleled in other Irish works such as the Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib. The Annals of Ulster documents the Viking invasions one year after the common starting event of the Viking Period, the raiding of Lindisfarne in 793, as mentioned by the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle. The first mentioning of the Vikings is very brief. \\"794.7 Devastation of all the islands of Britain by heathens,\\" yet over the course of the annals their attacks become more specific \\"807.8 The heathens burned Inis Muiredaig and invade Ros Com√°in.\\" The Vikings are called several different names throughout the annals: foreigners, dark or fair-foreigners, heathens, Norsemen, Norse-Irish and Danes. It is often unclear if these titles attribute nationalities or certain alliances as they are used intermixed throughout. The annals mention the foreigners‚Äô beginnings in Ireland as one of plunder and slave taking. According to the annals, the Norsemen took many slaves in their raids. \\"821.3 √âtar was plundered by the heathens, and they carried off a great number of women into captivity.\\" However, eventually they establish a permanent base in √Åth Cliath or Dublin by 841. In \\"841.4 There was a naval camp at Linn Duachaill from which the peoples and churches of Tethba were plundered. There was a naval camp at Duiblinn from which the Laigin and the U√≠ N√©ill were plundered, both states and churches, as far as Sliab Bladma.\\" Although the Vikings are portrayed as heathens, the Annals describes strife between the Irish against each other and often the foreigners are depicted as allies to various Irish factions. The depiction of warfare involving the \\"heathens\\" is not one-sided; in the annals they are often allied with the Irish against other Irish. Some Irishmen are even accused of doing the same sort of raiding as the Viking invaders. In \\"847.3 Mael Sechnaill destroyed the Island of Loch Muinremor, overcoming there a large band of wicked men of Luigni and Gailenga, who had been plundering the territories in the manner of the heathens.\\" Several famous battles and characters involving the Vikings can be found within the Annals of Ulster. The Battle of Brunanburh 937.6, the Battle of Tara 980.1, and the Battle of Clontarf 1014.1 are all described in brief detail. Some Viking individuals of note mentioned in the annals with parallels in other historical sources are the foreign chieftain Turgeis, beginning in 845, √çmar and Amla√≠b, the later progenitors of the U√≠ √çmair, rulers of √Åth Cliath or Dublin. Irish historical figures included within the text are M√°el Sechnaill, Muirchertach son of Niall and Brian Boru. Editions *Mac Airt, Se√°n and Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill (eds and trs.).

In circumstances still not clear, he received gunshot wounds inside the gendarmerie. The same day, three college students were arbitrarily arrested in the town of Amizour (B√©ja√Øa). Guermah later died of his wounds in the Mustapha Hospital on 20 April 2001. On 22 April 2001, the commander of La Gendarmerie Nationale released a statement in which he said that Guermah had been arrested after aggressive behaviour following a theft. The Interior Minister Yazid Zerhouni described Guermah as a \\"twenty-six year old delinquent.\\" In response to the Interior Minister's statement, Guermah's parents sent the national press a school report stating that the Massinissa was indeed an eighteen-year-old school student. Seven days after Guermah's death the military authorities gave an account of how it had occurred. Constable Mestari Merabet was referred to the Blida Military Tribunai for \\"breach of instructions and manslaughter.\\" But the incident was described as an accident caused when Merabet accidentally fired his gun. However, according to Koceila Merakeb who was arrested with Guermah, one round of bullets was fired in the waiting room, two bullets ricocheted off the floor and the third landed at the feet of another constable close by. Then Constable Mestari Merabet directed his gun at Guermah and fired. Guermah's killing caused riots in Kabylie lasting for several months; this series of events is referred to as the Black Spring. The violence was fuelled by an Algerian national campaign to impose the Arabic language on its people in place of indigenous languages, including Kabyle.

The name \\"Sugar Loaf\\" is sometimes taken to mean just the rock pinnacle, which was created by quarrying in the 19th century. The bluff stands above the junction of U.S. Route 61 and State Highway 43. It towers over Lake Winona (a former part of the Mississippi River's main channel), and the pinnacle rises more than above the remainder of the bluff. Sugar Loaf was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for having local significance in the theme of entertainment/recreation. It was nominated for being one of Minnesota's most famous landmarks to early travelers and tourists; a popular subject for stereopticon images, travel literature, and folklore. Rock pinnacle The rock pinnacle atop Sugar Loaf Sugar Loaf's distinctive pinnacle resulted from quarrying the bluff's limestone cap layer through most of the 1880s, which was then used for Winona's sidewalks and stone buildings. The mining was done by two brothers, John and Stephen O'Dea. The use of limestone (Oneota dolomite‚Äîa sedimentary limestone composed mainly of calcium and magnesium carbonate) began with the need to improve city sidewalks, most of which were made of wood and burned in the 1862 fire that destroyed 90 percent of the downtown district. Many miles of this limestone were installed before the turn of the 20th century and met with such success that a city ordinance was passed in late 1890 specifying stone-only for sidewalks. Buildings in the area also began to utilize the stone because of its texture. Quarry operations were shut down in 1887. A rare event occurred in March 2004. Tons of limestone sheared off the northwest face of the pinnacle, leaving a dark trail of rock rubble in the snow, down a lower cliff face, and onto the tree-covered slope below. The cascade stopped about short of the nearest house. The layers of stone came loose and fell because of the freezing and thawing action of water over time, especially from the unusually wet winter. History Sugar Loaf stereoscopic view card circa 1870, by Charles A. Zimmerman, 1844-1909 In its original configuration as a rounded half-dome with a fringe of evergreen on the crown, the bluff was well known to early explorers, traders, tourists, and river boat pilots. Native American legend has it that the mountain represented the cap of Chief Wapasha I transformed into stone. Another legend refers to a mythological dispute at the site of Red Wing, Minnesota, upriver from Winona in which a single bluff split into Barn Bluff (which remained at Red Wing) and Sugar Loaf, which was moved downriver to its present site. The name \\"Sugar Loaf\\" refers to the former formation's resemblance to the conical loaves that sugar used to be packaged and sold in. There are many hills and mountains named \\"Sugar Loaf\\" in the United States. At least three other hills or bluffs bearing the name \\"Sugar Loaf\\" are located in or near the Mississippi River Valley in proximity to Winona. More than a few local businesses that incorporate Sugar Loaf into their names have been built at the base of the bluff. The Sugar Loaf name is also given to a neighborhood (which shows as a city on some maps) south and east of the hill. The former Sugar Loaf Brewery (Peter Bub's Brewery) building is nestled into the northeastern slope. The brewery complex, which extended caves into Sugar Loaf, is separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is a turn-based strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic future which resembles the world portrayed in the Mad Max films. Gameplay and plot In 1999, a terrorist group unleashes a deadly virus on the United States, leading to its collapse. Various vigilante and survivalist groups appear and cars become the primary form of transportation and combat. The player starts off as sort of a scavenger and attempts to build up an army capable of making crossings between cities on highways, which have become littered with hordes of marauding mutants, cannibals, and criminal gangs. Winning enough battles and gathering a sizable army may bring the player's character to attention of the ailing US government, who will recruit the player to find eight missing scientists, America's only hope to finding a cure for the disease. The player must bring them back to a secret base. Along the way, the player must loot cities and scavenge for needed supplies and munitions. The game calculates and displays detailed statistics during combat encounters which, not surprisingly, occur fairly often. While these text messages were displayed in simple text on the early versions of the game, the Amiga and Atari ST versions accompany these battles with digitized sound. Platforms Roadwar 2000 was originally released for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1986. In 1987, it was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, FM-7, NEC PC-8801 and DOS. The Amiga, Atari ST and Apple IIGS versions, developed by Westwood Associates, sported digital sound effects and higher-quality graphics than the previous versions. Reception SSI sold 44,044 copies of Roadwar 2000 in North America. The game was reviewed in 1987 in Dragon #118 by Hartley and Patricia Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers stated that \\"Roadwar 2000 is a great offering and is easily enjoyed by players who have fantasy role-playing backgrounds because you do, indeed, control the shots for your crew.\\" In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Compute! stated that the game successfully combined individual combat and strategy with good graphics, and concluded that it was \\"yet another successful product from SSI\\". In 1992 and 1994 survey of science fiction games, Computer Gaming World gave the title two-plus stars of five, stating that \\"It is quite dated today, although it can be fun as a semi-'no brainer'\\". Robbie Robberson reviewed Roadwar 2000 in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 81. Robberson commented that \\"In short, the Roadwar series is an example of a good idea that is short circuited by its components. If Strategic Simulations, Inc. can release these games with a better and quicker combat routine, or better yet, reduce the incidence of combat, these games would be a required addition to every serious computer gamer's library. As of now, they are simply entertaining in the short run, and tedious in the long.\\" Sequel Roadwar 2000 was followed by Roadwar Europa in 1987. It was developed for the same platforms as R2000. This game, set in Europe, is graphically almost identical to its predecessor. Terrorists have devastated one city and are threatening to blow up the continent. It is up to the player to stop them.

Merger policy The government's stated goal is to reduce the total number of Japanese municipalities to 1,000. The government did not provide a distinct timetable. Japan had around 1,822 municipalities at the beginning of 2007, considerably less than the 2,190 on April 1, 2005, and a decline of 40 percent from the number in 1999. The 1,822 municipalities include 198 villages, 777 cities and 847 towns. The municipality merger promotion law was revised to ease the burden on debt- ridden local governments and to create larger municipalities so more administrative power could be transferred to the local level. The law's deadline passed on March 31, 2006.  Record of changes  *List of mergers and dissolutions of municipalities in Japan shows mergers and dissolutions of municipalities that took place in recent years. Reasons for merging As of January 2006, many municipalities in Japan contained fewer than 200 residents. Japanese municipalities require skilled workers. 40% of Japan's GDP consisted of debts from local governments. Japan merges local governments to expand residential area per municipal government, create different school attendance boundaries for elementary school and junior high school students, and to allow more widespread use of public facilities.\\"Consolidation of Local Governments in Japan and Effects on Sister City Relationships,\\" (Archive) Consulate General of Japan, San Francisco  Socio-political context  Most of Japan's rural municipalities largely depend on subsidies from the central government. They are often criticized for spending money for wasteful public enterprises to keep jobs. The central government, which is itself running budget deficits, has a policy of encouraging mergers to make the municipal system more efficient. Although the government purports to respect self-determination of the municipalities, some consider the policy to be compulsory. As a result of mergers, some cities such as Daisen, Akita temporarily have very large city assemblies. Some people see it as a form of federalism; they consider that the ultimate goal is to change Japan into a union consisting of more autonomous states. So far the mergers are limited to the local municipalities. Mergers of prefectures are also planned in some regions of Japan.  Past mergers  There have been three waves of merger activity between Japanese municipalities, the largest being in 2005. This recent peak is sometimes referred to as as a way of distinguishing it from the earlier two. The first peak of mergers, known as , happened in 1889, when the modern municipal system was established. Before the mergers, existing municipalities were the direct successors of spontaneous hamlets called , or villages under the han system. The rump han system is still reflected in the postal system for rural areas as postal units called . The Meiji mergers slashed total municipalities from 71,314 to 15,859. The second peak, called , took place in the mid-1950s. It reduced the number of municipalities by over half, from 9,868 to 3,472. Municipal mergers in the island prefectures of Hokkaid≈ç and Okinawa, have followed different tracks.  Naming of new municipalities  Naming a new post-merger municipality is not a negligible matter. Disagreement on a name sometimes causes merger talks to break down. If a city is far larger than other towns which join it, no arguments take place; the city's name simply survives. However, if their sizes do not differ significantly, lengthy disputes ensue. Sometimes the problem can be solved by adopting the district's name. Another easy solution is a simple compounding of the names, but this method, relatively common in Europe, is unusual in Japan. Instead, they are often abbreviated. For example, the ≈åta (Â§ßÁî∞) ward of Tokyo is a portmanteau of ≈åmori (Â§ßÊ£Æ) and Kamata (Ëí≤Áî∞), it seems that ≈åkama was not chosen because of its likeness to 'okama', a derogatory word for homosexual. Toyoshina, Nagano, is an acronym of the four antecedent villages: Toba, Yoshino, Shinden, and Nariai. Another common method is borrowing a well known nearby place name and adding a direction, like Nishit≈çky≈ç (\\"West Tokyo\\"), Kitaky≈´sh≈´ (\\"North Ky≈´sh≈´\\"), Higashi≈çsaka (\\"East Osaka\\"), Shikokuch≈´≈ç (\\"Central Shikoku\\") and recently Higashi≈çmi (\\"East ≈åmi\\"). Other towns sometimes use nouns with pleasant connotations, such as , , or . A characteristic of the Heisei mergers is a rapid increase of hiragana names. The names of Japan's cities used to be written in Kanji exclusively. The first instance of \\"hiragana municipalities\\" was , renamed in 1960. Their number reached 45 by April 2006. They include , , , , and , which was upgraded to a designated city in 2003. The creation of Minami Alps in 2003 is the first example of a katakana city name.

Two aircraft hit the World Trade Center while the third hit the Pentagon. A fourth plane never arrived at its target, crashing in a field in Pennsylvania after a passenger revolt. The intended target is believed to have been either the United States Capitol or the White House. As a result, 2,977 victims were killed, making it the deadliest foreign attack on U.S. soil, exceeding Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, which killed 2,335 members of the United States Armed Forces and 68 civilians. It was carefully planned by al-Qaeda, who sent 19 terrorists to take over Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 aircraft, operated by American Airlines and United Airlines. Background Al-Qaeda's origins date back to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Soon after the invasion, Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen. Together with Abdullah Azzam, a Palestinian-Jordanian who influenced bin Laden, they formed Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK) in 1984, to provide support for Arab mujahideen who came to join the jihad in Afghanistan. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Soviets were retreating in defeat. Bin Laden and Azzam had discussions about the future of MAK and what to do with the mujahideen force that had built up. Bin Laden and Azzam both wanted to use the force as a \\"rapid reaction force\\" to defend oppressed Muslims around the world. Bin Laden wanted to train the mujahideen in terrorist tactics, while Azzam strongly disagreed with this approach, issuing a fatwa saying that it would violate Islamic law. Azzam reiterated the hadith that orders Muslims not to kill any women or children. In November 1989, soon after bin Laden and Azzam split, Azzam was killed in Peshawar, Pakistan. Azzam and his two sons were travelling to Jummah (Friday prayer) when a remote-control activated bomb detonated and killed them. It is not known for certain if bin Laden was behind this, but thought unlikely. Nonetheless, bin Laden was free to take full control of MAK, laying the groundwork for al-Qaeda. Under the guidance of Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden became more radical. In 1991, bin Laden moved to Sudan, where he led operations in East Africa, including the 1993 assault on U.S. troops at Mogadishu in Somalia. Under international pressure, the Sudanese forced bin Laden out of Sudan in 1996, and he returned to Afghanistan. Ideology The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 marked a point where bin Laden turned his attention toward the United States. He strongly urged the Saudi regime not to host the 500,000 U.S. soldiers, instead advocating the use of a mujaheddin force to oust the Iraqis. Bin Laden strongly opposed the continued presence of U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia. He interpreted the Prophet Muhammad as banning the \\"permanent presence of infidels in Arabia\\". This drove bin Laden to attack U.S. military targets in Saudi Arabia. Also, the date chosen for the 1998 Kenyan embassy bombings (August 7), was eight years to the day that American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.Plotz, David (2001) What Does Osama Bin Laden Want? , Slate Bin Laden also stated that he viewed the House of Saud (the Saudi royal family) as apostates. In Islam, the charge of apostasy is made against Muslims who have become non-believers and reject Islam. Bin Laden also objected to U.S. alliances with the governments of Kuwait, Jordan, and Egypt. He viewed Israelis as infidels who are not welcome in \\"Muslim land\\". He objected to U.S. foreign policy in relation to Israel. He noted that key figures Madeleine Albright, Sandy Berger, and William Cohen, who were all Jewish, \\"drove Washington's undoubtedly pro-Israel policy\\" during the Clinton administration. Fatwas In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa, calling for the U.S. military to leave Saudi Arabia. In Islam, a fatwa can only be given by an Islamic scholar; however, Osama bin Laden was a political fighter who used Islam to motivate his fighters. The 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings marked a turning point, with bin Laden intent on attacking the U.S.9/11 Commission Report,Chapter 5 Bin Laden issued another fatwa in February 1998, together with Ayman al Zawahiri, declaring war against the U.S. Bin Laden stated \\"We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they [Americans] are all targets.\\" Bin Laden cited grievances including the presence of U.S. infidels (soldiers) in the Saudi Arabian holy land, the suffering of the Iraqi people due to sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War, and U.S. support of Israel. In his December 1999 interview with Rahimullah Yusufzai, bin Laden reiterated his ideology and objected to U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. He proclaimed that the U.S. was \\"too near to Mecca\\", which he considered a provocation to the entire Muslim world. He also believed Israel \\"was killing and punishing Palestinians with American money and American arms.\\" Origins of the September 11 attacks Khalid Sheikh Mohammed first presented the idea for the September 11 plot to bin Laden in 1996 in Afghanistan.Suspect 'reveals 9/11 planning' , BBC News However, nothing came of the idea at the time. According to the September 11 Commission, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed envisioned a hijacking of twelve airplanes on both the East and West coasts, and for eleven of them to be crashed into the World Trade Center and the Empire State Building in New York City; The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia; the Prudential Tower in Boston, Massachusetts; the White House and the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.; the Willis Tower (then Sears Tower) in Chicago, Illinois; the U.S. Bank Tower (then Library Tower) in Los Angeles, California; the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco, California; and the Columbia Center in Seattle, Washington. In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to President Bill Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the U.S., including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft. In late-1998 or early-1999, bin Laden summoned Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to Kandahar and gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with the plot. A series of meetings occurred in the spring of 1999, involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and his deputy Mohammed Atef. Bin Laden recommended four individuals for the plot, including Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, Walid Muhammad Salih Bin 'Attash (Khallad), and Abu Bara al-Taizi. Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were both Saudi citizens, thus making it simple for them to obtain U.S. visas. Khallad and al-Taizi were both Yemeni citizens, thus not able to easily obtain visas to the United States. The two Yemenis were assigned for the Asia component of the plot. When Mohamed Atta and other members of the Hamburg cell arrived in Afghanistan, bin Laden was involved in selecting them for the plot, and assigning Atta to be the leader. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the head of al-Qaeda's 'military committee'. He provided operational support, such as selecting targets and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed explained to Fouda, \\"We had a large surplus of brothers willing to die as martyrs. As we studied various targets, nuclear facilities arose as a key option\\"... but the nuclear targets were dropped for concerns the plan would \\"get out of hand.\\" Hamburg cell Mohamed Atta, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah came into the picture in 1999, when they arrived in Kandahar from Germany. The Hamburg cell was formed starting in 1998 shortly after Atta got approval by Al-Qaeda leadership for his plot. Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Said Bahaji, Zakariyah Essabar, and fifteen others were all members. Mohamed Atta was very religious, but not fanatically so when he came to Germany in Fall 1992 to study urban planning at the Technical University of Hamburg. While in Germany, he was drawn to Al Quds Mosque in Hamburg, which adheres to a \\"harsh, uncompromisingly fundamentalist, and resoundingly militant\\" version of Sunni Islam. A friend of Atta's recalled meeting him at the Al-Quds mosque in 1993, though it is not known when he started going there. Atta had always lived as a strict Muslim, but after making a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1995, he returned to Germany more of a fanatic than ever before. Also in late 1997, Mohamed Atta told his roommate that he was going to Mecca, but he most likely went to Afghanistan instead. Atta had already made his Mecca pilgrimage 18 months earlier. According to Al Jazeera journalist Yosri Fouda, Atta went to the mosque around this time \\"not to pray but to sign his death will.\\" He is known to have attended Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1999 and 2000.Atta 'trained in Afghanistan' , BBC News, August 24, 2002. Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who also went under the name \\"Ramzi Omar\\", was a citizen of Yemen. In 1995, he came to Germany seeking asylum, claiming to be a political refugee from Sudan. The judge refused the asylum request, and bin al-Shibh returned to the Hadramawt region of Yemen. Bin al-Shibh later got a German visa under his real name, and came to Germany in 1997. There, he met Mohamed Atta, the leader of the Hamburg cell, at a mosque. Ramzi bin al-Shibh: al-Qaeda suspect , BBC, September 14, 2002 For two years, Atta and bin al- Shibh were roommates in Germany. In late 1999, bin al-Shibh traveled to Kandahar in Afghanistan, where he received training at Al-Qaeda training camps, and met others involved in planning the 9/11 attacks. Original plans for the 9/11 attacks called for bin al-Shibh to be one of the hijacker pilots, along with Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah. From Hamburg, Germany, bin al-Shibh applied to take flight training in the United States. At that time, he also applied to Aviation Language Services, which provides language training for student pilots.Zacarias Moussauoi v. the United States , trial testimony on March 7, 2006. Bin al-Shibh applied for an entry visa to the U.S. four times and was refused each time. He made visa applications in Germany on May 17, 2000, and again in June, on September 16, and October 25, 2000.Indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui , with supporting conspirators, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. According to the 9/11 Commission, this refusal of a visa was out of general concern by U.S. officials that people from Yemen would illegally overstay their visit and seek work in the United States. His friend, Zakariyah Essabar, was also denied visas. After he failed to enter the United States, bin al-Shibh took on more of a \\"coordinator\\" role in the plot, and a link between Atta in the United States and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Afghanistan. Marwan al-Shehhi came to Bonn, Germany, in 1996 on scholarship from the United Arab Emirates Army to study marine engineering. Al-Shehhi met Atta in 1997, and in 1998, he moved to Hamburg to join Atta and bin al-Shibh.9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 5 , p. 162 As the son of a religiously trained father, al-Shehhi was very religious, well-educated in Islam, and adhered to a strict form of the faith. However, he had a friendlier, more humorous personality than Atta, who was very serious and more reclusive. Ziad Jarrah came from Lebanon to Germany in April 1996, where he enrolled in a junior college in Greifswald. There, he met his girlfriend, Aysel Senguen, a medical student. By late 1996, Jarrah started to become radical in his religious views. In September 1997, he transferred to the Technical University of Hamburg to study aircraft engineering. In the summer of that year, he worked at a paint shop factory for Volkswagen in Wolfsburg. Other members of the Hamburg cell included Said Bahaji, who came to Germany in 1995. He had been born there, but moved to Morocco at age 9. In 1996, Said Bahaji enrolled in the electrical engineering program at the technical university. He spent weekdays at a student home and weekends at the home of his aunt, Barbara Arens. Arens, his \\"high tech aunt\\", stopped the weekend visits when she saw his religious beliefs had become more radical. Selection for September 11 plot In 1999, this group decided to go to Chechnya to fight. While still in Germany, they met Khalid al Masri who put the group in contact with Abu Musab in Duisburg, Germany. Abu Musab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Salahi. Salahi advised them that it would be difficult to get into Chechnya and advised them instead to go to Afghanistan for training first. In late 1999, the Hamburg group met with bin Laden, and pledged loyalty to him. They agreed to undertake a highly secret mission, and were told to enroll in flight training. Atta was selected by bin Laden to lead the group. Bin Laden met with Atta several more times for additional instructions. The selection of hijackers was entirely a decision made by bin Laden and Mohammed Atef. The hijackers had not yet met with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. At the time, the hijacking team also included Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, who were selected in early 1999 by Osama bin Laden. Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah all obtained new passports, claiming the old ones were lost, before applying for U.S. visas. Atta, Jarrah, and bin al-Shibh returned to Hamburg, early in 2000, while al-Shehhi went back to the United Arab Emirates to get a new passport and U.S. visa. Once back in Germany, they made efforts to appear less radical: they distanced themselves from the others, stopped attending extremist mosques, and changed their appearance and behavior. Jarrah, for example, began to behave more the way he did when he first met Senguen. Arrival in the United States Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles on January 15, 2000. On January 18, Marwan al-Shehhi applied for a visa into the United States while he was in the United Arab Emirates. He was the first member of the Hamburg cell to apply for a visa. By the end of June, Atta, Jarrah, and al-Shehhi left for the United States. Bin al-Shibh and Essabar wanted to join Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah, but they were denied U.S. visas several times. Bin al-Shibh's visa was denied since he was a citizen of Yemen. He made several more attempts at receiving a U.S. visa. One such attempt was a $2,200 deposit he had sent to the Florida Flight Training Center, on a down payment for a similar training course taken by Ziad Jarrah. He used that application as a basis for a new attempt to get a student visa, as opposed to the visitor visa he had sought previously. On another occasion, he arranged for several thousand dollars to be deposited in his Yemen bank account, to demonstrate financial wherewithal. After his final attempt failed, he was advised by a consular official that they could not help him, and to stop trying. It was then that Bin al-Shibh decided to support the cell by sending money to it. Mohammed was making repeated trips to Indonesia and the Philippines in Southeast Asia at the time. Jarrah nearly abandoned his role in the plot and probably would have been replaced by Zacarias Moussaoui had he done so. A man named Omar al-Bayoumi had been in San Diego, California, since 1995. He was raising a family and received a monthly stipend from his former employer, an aviation company in Saudi Arabia. He was seen regularly videotaping various locations. Al-Bayoumi was quick to house immigrants who needed housing. In 2000, he settled in Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. According to al-Hazmi, al-Bayoumi met him and al-Mihdhar at a restaurant in Los Angeles. Al-Bayoumi offered a ride to San Diego after he heard the men speak Arabic. Al-Bayoumi threw the men a welcome party and al-Hazmi, who said he was in the United States to learn English, signed a six-month lease. He often surfed the Internet from the San Diego State University Library. The first two months of the lease were paid for, yet the men complained that the lease was too expensive. In the spring, al-Hazmi told a friend that someone was going to wire $5000 to him, and that the money would come from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hazmi told his friend that he had no account. The friend allowed him to use his account, and later found that the money came from a man named \\"Ali\\", and that it did not originate in the United States. The two men wanted to take flight lessons, which is why they got the money. A friend took them to Montgomery Field and arranged lessons for them. They took a single flight lesson and did not return. Fereidoun \\"Fred\\" Sorbi, the instructor, recalled, \\"The first day they came in here, they said they want to fly Boeings. We said you have to start slower. You can't just jump right into Boeings.\\" Al-Hazmi had season passes to the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld. The men frequented a men's club in San Diego called Cheetah's, which is near the Islamic Center. Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi frequently drove to Las Vegas in the Toyota sedan they bought. Flight training In March 2000, Mohamed Atta contacted the Academy of Lakeland in Florida, via e-mail, inquiring about flight training, \\"Dear sir, we are a small group of young men from different Arab countries. Now we are living in Germany since a while for study purposes. We would like to start training for the career of airline professional pilots. In this field we haven't yet any knowledge but we are ready to undergo an intensive training program (up to ATP and eventually higher).\\" He sent 50‚Äì60 similar e-mails to other flight training schools in the United States. On May 18, 2000, Atta applied for and received a U.S. visa. After obtaining his visa, Atta traveled to Prague before going to the United States. Atta, along with Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah arrived in Venice, Florida, and visited Huffman Aviation to \\"check out the facility.\\" They explained that \\"they came from a flight school in the area, they were not happy and they were looking for another flight school\\". By December, Atta and al-Shehhi left Huffman Aviation, and on December 21, Atta received a pilot license. Jarrah had left Huffman Aviation on January 15, 2001, a month after Atta and Al-Shehhi had done so. Final preparations About three weeks prior to the attacks, the targets were assigned to four teams. The United States Capitol/The White House was called \\"The Faculty of Law\\". The Pentagon was dubbed \\"The Faculty of Fine Arts\\". Mohammed Atta codenamed the World Trade Center \\"The Faculty of Town Planning\\". Financial support The 9/11 Commission stated in their final report that the \\"9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack\\" but the \\"origin of the funds remains unknown.\\" The Commission noted: \\"we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding.\\" CNN claimed in October 2001 that U.S. investigators believed Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh (Ahmed Umar Syed Sheikh), using the alias Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad, sent more than $100,000 from Pakistan to Mohamed Atta, the suspected hijack ringleader of the September 11, 2001, attacks. \\"Investigators said Atta then distributed the funds to conspirators in Florida in the weeks before the deadliest acts of terrorism on U.S. soil that destroyed the World Trade Center, heavily damaged the Pentagon and left thousands dead [...] Syed also is described as a key figure in the funding operation of Al-Qaeda, the network headed by suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.\\" The Pittsburgh Tribune noted \\"There are many in Musharraf's government who believe that Saeed Sheikh's power comes not from the ISI, but from his connections with our own CIA.\\" CNN later confirmed that it was \\"Ahmed Umar Syed Sheikh, authorities say used a pseudonym to wire $100,000 to suspected hijacker Mohammad Atta, who then distributed the money in the United States.\\" Soon after the money transfer was discovered, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, Gen. Mahmood (Mahmud) Ahmed, resigned from his position. Indian news outlets reported the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating the possibility that Gen. Mahmood Ahmed ordered Saeed Sheikh to send the $100,000 to Atta, while most Western media outlets only reported his connections to the Taliban as the reason for his departure from the ISI. The Wall Street Journal was one of the few Western news organizations to follow up on the story, citing the Times of India: \\"US authorities sought [Gen. Mahmud Ahmed's] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 [was] wired to WTC hijacker Mohamed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the insistence of Gen Mahmud.\\" The best coverage came from The Daily Excelsior, reporting \\"The FBI‚Äôs examination of the hard disk of the cellphone company Omar Sheikh had subscribed to led to the discovery of the \\"link\\" between him and the deposed chief of the Pakistani ISI, Gen. Mehmood Ahmed. And as the FBI investigators delved deep, sensational information surfaced with regard to the transfer of $100,000 to Mohamed Atta, one of the pilots who flew a Boeing into the World Trade Center. Gen. Mehmood Ahmed, the FBI investigators found, fully knew about the transfer of money to Atta.\\"Daily Excelsior News Page According to the Washington Post, \\"on the morning of Sept. 11, [Porter] Goss and [Bob] Graham were having breakfast with a Pakistani general named Mahmud Ahmed the soon-to-be-sacked head of Pakistan's intelligence service\\" On September 12 and 13, Lt. Gen. Mahmood met with United States Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Senator Joseph Biden, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Secretary of State Colin Powell. An agreement on Pakistan's collaboration in the new \\"war on terror\\" was negotiated between Mahmood and Armitage. Lt. Gen. Mehmood Ahmed then led a six-member delegation to the Afghan city of Kandahar in order to hold crisis talks with the Taliban leadership, supposedly in an attempt to persuade them to hand over Osama bin Laden. In June 2001, a \\"high-placed member of a US intelligence agency\\" told BBC reporter Greg Palast that \\"after the [2000] elections, the agencies were told to \\"back off\\" investigating the bin Ladens and Saudi royals\\". In May 2002, former FBI agent Robert Wright Jr. delivered a tearful press conference apologizing to the families who lost loved ones on September 11. He described how his superiors intentionally obstructed his investigation into Al-Qaeda financing. Agent Wright later told ABC's Brian Ross: \\"September 11th is a direct result of the incompetence of the FBI's International Terrorism Unit\\", specifically referring to the Bureau's hindering of his investigation into Yasin al-Qadi, whom Ross described as a powerful Saudi Arabian businessman with extensive financial ties in Chicago. One month after September 11, the U.S. government officially identified Yassin al-Qadi as one of Osama bin Laden's primary financiers and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. In an interview with Computerworld Magazine, a former business associate described his relationship with al-Qadi: \\"I met him a few times and talked to him a few times on the telephone. He never talked to me about violence. Instead, he talked very highly of his relationship with [former President] Jimmy Carter and [Vice President] Dick Cheney.\\" The Muwafaq Foundation, which U.S. authorities have confirmed was an arm of bin Laden's terror organization, was headed by Yassin al-Qadi, who was also known as the owner of Ptech a company that has supplied high-tech computer systems to the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Congress, the United States Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the White House. Matthew Levitt, a former FBI counter-terrorism agent, commented: \\"For someone like [al-Qadi] to be involved in a capacity, in an organization, a company that has access to classified information, that has access to government open or classified computer systems, would be of grave concern.\\" Also sitting on Ptech's board of directors was Yacub Mirza \\"a senior official of major radical Islamic organizations that have been linked by the US government to terrorism.\\" In addition, Hussein Ibrahim, the Vice President and Chief Scientist of Ptech, was vice chairman of a now defunct investment group called BMI, a company the FBI has named as a conduit used by al-Qadi to launder money to Hamas militants. According to Senator Bob Graham, who was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from June 2001 through the buildup to the Iraq war, \\"Two of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers had a support network in the United States that included agents of the Saudi government, and the Bush administration and FBI blocked a congressional investigation into that relationship\\", as reported by the Miami Herald: \\"And in Graham's book, Intelligence Matters, obtained by The Herald Saturday, he makes clear that some details of that financial support from Saudi Arabia were in the 27 pages of the congressional inquiry's final report that were blocked from release by the administration, despite the pleas of leaders of both parties on the House and Senate intelligence committees.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:September 11 attacks Category:Hamburg cell ","title":"Planning of the September 11 attacks"},{"id":"1491308","text":"Anselm Hollo 'Why there is a Cat Curfew in my House\\". Anselm Paul Alexis Hollo (12 April 1934 - 29 January 2013) was a Finnish poet and translator. He lived in the United States from 1967 until his death in January 2013. Hollo published more than forty titles of poetry in the United Kingdom and in the United States, with a style strongly influenced by the American beat poets. Personal life Paavo Anselm Aleksis Hollo was born in Helsinki, Finland. His father, Juho August Hollo (1885‚Äì1967) ‚Äî who liked to be known as \\"J. A.\\" Hollo ‚Äî was professor of pedagogy at the University of Helsinki, an essayist, and a major translator of literature into Finnish. His mother was Iris Antonina Anna Walden (1899‚Äì1983), a music teacher and daughter of organic chemist Paul Walden. He lived for eight years in the United Kingdom and had three children, Hannes, Kaarina, and Tamsin, with his first wife, poet Josephine Clare. He was a permanent resident in the United States from the late 1960s until his death. At the time of his death, he resided in Boulder, Colorado with his second wife, artist Jane Dalrymple-Hollo. Career In the 1960s Hollo lived in London and worked at the Finnish section of BBC World Service. One of his tasks there was to write radio dramas in Finnish, together with another Finnish poet, Matti Rossi. The music to their productions was written by Erkki Toivanen. Around this time he was also beginning to make a name for himself as a poet in the English language. In 1965, Hollo performed at the \\"underground\\" International Poetry Incarnation, London. Also in the same year, the first customer of the Indica Bookshop, a certain Paul McCartney, is known to have bought, among other things, the book & it is a song by Anselm Hollo the day before the bookshop was officially opened. In 2001, poets and critics associated with the SUNY Buffalo POETICS list elected Hollo to the honorary position of \\"anti-laureate\\", in protest at the appointment of Billy Collins to the position of Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Hollo translated poetry and belles-lettres from Finnish, German, Swedish, and French into English. He was one of the early translators of Allen Ginsberg into German and Finnish. Hollo taught creative writing in eighteen different institutions of higher learning, including SUNY Buffalo, the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and the University of Colorado at Boulder. Since 1985, he taught in the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University, where he held the rank of Full Professor.Anselm Hollo- Poets.org - Poetry, Poems, Bios & More Several of his poems have been set into music by pianist and composer Frank Carlberg. Poets Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley named their son Anselm Berrigan after Hollo. Hollo became ill during the summer of 2012, and had brain surgery. Hollo died from post operative pneumonia on 29 January 2013 at the age of 78.

She is best remembered for the role of Esther \\"Grandma\\" Walton on the CBS television series The Waltons, for which she won three Emmy Awards. She was also nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Aunt Trina in I Remember Mama (1948). Early life Ellen Hansen was born in Racine, Wisconsin, to immigrant parents from Denmark. She grew up in Philadelphia. An interest in amateur theater while in high school led her to Atlantic City in 1932, where she briefly worked as a chorus girl. She moved to Hollywood that same year and got a job as a script girl at RKO Studios and Hal Roach Studios, where she often worked on Our Gang comedies, alongside her future husband, cinematographer Francis Corby. She held that position for the next 12 years and took acting lessons on the side. Career Although she had bit parts in more than 30 films in the 1930s and 1940s, including Babes in Toyland (1934) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), her first credited acting role was in RKO's Cornered (1945) in which she played a maid, followed by an uncredited brief speaking role as a kitchen cook in The Locket (1946). Corby began her career as a writer at Paramount studios working on the western Twilight on the Trail (1941). She received an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as a lovelorn aunt in I Remember Mama (1948). Over the next four decades, she worked in film and television, typically portraying maids, secretaries, waitresses, or gossips, often in Westerns, and had a recurring role as Henrietta Porter, a newspaper publisher, in Trackdown (1957-1959), starring Robert Culp as Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman. In the episode entitled \\"The Vote\\", Henrietta Porter advocates for women's suffrage: \\"Women should have the right to vote. Women should be in politics. They can't do any worse than you men!\\" For her guest appearances in many Westerns, Corby in 1989 won a Golden Boot award.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), p. 104 Corby appeared as the elderly Mrs. Lesh, the crooked car peddler, on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show. She guest-starred, as well, on Wagon Train, Cheyenne, The Guns of Will Sonnett, Dragnet (several episodes), Rescue 8, The Restless Gun (two episodes), The Rifleman, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Fury, The Donna Reed Show, Frontier Circus, Hazel, I Love Lucy, Dennis the Menace, Tightrope, Bonanza, The Big Valley, Meet McGraw, The Virginian, Channing, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Batman, Get Smart, Gomer Pyle, The Addams Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Invaders, Lassie, and Night Gallery. From 1965 to 1967, she had a recurring role in the NBC television series Please Don't Eat the Daisies, based on an earlier Doris Day film. Her best-known role came as Grandma Esther Walton on the made-for-TV film The Homecoming: A Christmas Story (1971), which served as the pilot for The Waltons. Her husband, Zebulon Walton, was portrayed by actor Edgar Bergen in the film. Corby went on to resume her role on the weekly television series The Waltons. (She was the only adult actor from the original Homecoming pilot to carry her role over to the series.) Actor Will Geer played her husband in the series from 1972 until his death in 1978, at which time the character of Zebulon Walton was also buried. The series ran from 1972 to 1981, and resulted in six sequel films. For her work in The Waltons, she gained three Emmy Awards and three more nominations as Best Supporting Actress. She also won a Golden Globe award for best supporting actress in a TV series for The Waltons, and was nominated another three times. She left the show November 10, 1976, owing to a massive stroke she had suffered at home, which impaired her speech and severely limited her mobility and function. She returned to the series during the final episode of the 1977‚Äì78 season, with her character depicted as also recovering from a stroke. She remained a regular on The Waltons through the end of the 1978‚Äì79 season, with Esther Walton struggling with her stroke deficits as Corby was in real life. Although Corby was able to communicate after her stroke, her character's lines were usually limited to one word or one-phrased dialogue, such as \\"No\\" or \\"Home\\"; her role dropped to recurring during The Waltons' final two seasons, though she later resumed her role as Grandma Walton in five of the six Waltons reunion movies between 1982 and 1997. Personal life Ellen Hansen married Francis Corby, a film director/cinematographer who was two decades her senior, in 1934; they divorced in 1944. The marriage did not produce children and she never remarried. Francis Corby died in 1956. Corby in 1969 trained as a teacher of transcendental meditation. She had a stroke in November 1976 from which she recovered and returned to her role on The Waltons in March 1978. According to Michael Learned, who played Olivia Walton, Will Geer may have saved her life. When she failed to show up for work, Geer immediately suspected something was wrong as Corby was a true professional who was never late. So Geer went with the show's producers to her home, where they found that she had suffered a stroke. Following the stroke, Corby was supported by her partner, Stella Luchetta, whom she met in the 1950s. and who lived with her until her death. Her final role was in A Walton Easter (1997). In 1999, following several years of declining health, Corby died at age 87 at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.

Plot Eleven-year-old Phelim Green awakes to find his house full of small creatures, led by the Domovoy which has been living behind his stove. As the Domovoy explains to Phelim that the monsters attacking him are called 'hatchlings', the house is attacked by a monstrous black dog. The Domovoy saves Phelim from being eaten, but evicts him from his house. Confused, Phelim wanders into a forest, where he meets a tree-dwelling tramp named Mad Sweeney, and later sees a washerwoman cleaning a bloody shirt. He flees in terror, encountering Alexia, a strange girl with no shadow, on a bridge. They are attacked by a hatchling that uses treasure to lure Phelim into the river. The pair are saved by Sweeney, who explains that the hatchlings come from ‚Äòstones‚Äô hatched by a gigantic Stoor Worm buried under Europe, which has been awoken by the sound of artillery from the First World War. Alexia tells Phelim that he is 'Jack O'Green', the hero fated to stop the worm from destroying Europe, helped by the Maiden, the Fool, and the Horse. After performing a spell to summon the Horse, Phelim, Alexia and Sweeney are joined by a talking creature made of cloth called the Obby Oss. It takes them to Storidge, where the Worm's head is. Upon arrival, the trio undertake a variety of quests before discovering that Mr. Pringle, the Storidge librarian, has taken control of the town and is forcing its residents to perform ancient rituals to ward off the hatchlings. Pringle learns that Phelim is Jack O‚ÄôGreen and convinces him to take part in a tradition of carrying a burning bale of straw across the town. Alexia takes the bale from him and tries to continue the ritual, but it sets her on fire and she dies. Sweeney and Phelim use Alexia‚Äôs bones to make a ‚Äòwitch‚Äôs ladder‚Äô which they use to climb the cliff up to the Stoor Worm's head. At the top of the cliff, Phelim sees the Worm's soul wandering out of her mouth as she dreams; he attacks it and throws into the sea, killing the Worm. Sweeney and Phelim resurrect Alexia, but she is not the same, so they change her name to Aisling, meaning ‚Äòdream‚Äô. Phelim returns home and confronts his older sister Prudence. He discovers that his father didn‚Äôt die, as she had always told him; he was a dreamer, which Prudence hated, so after their mother died, she had him committed to an asylum. Angry, Phelim summons the ushtey, a water spirit, and tricks Prudence into riding it. It carries her away to the ocean, where she presumably drowns. As the story ends, Phelim and Aisling go to the asylum, where they find that his father is the gardener. Themes The book is set in 1919. The hatchlings of the book echo the horrors of war. McCaughrean uses various creatures from English, Irish, Manx, Orcadian, Scottish, and Slavic folklore and mythology, including the bean-nighe, bugganes, the Domovoy, merrows, the neck, the nuckelavee, the Stoor Worm, and ushteys. Background McCaughrean has said that in the process of writing The Stones Are Hatching: \\"I took it apart so many times, it was like that blouse you make in school that you hate the sight of. I thought it had done for me, that I‚Äôd never again enjoy writing\\". Reception Kirkus Reviews compared the book favourably with the \\"resounding menace\\" of William Mayne's Hob and the Goblins, but criticised the \\"distracting family subplot\\". In January 2000, children's author Linda Newbery chose The Stones Are Hatching for Books for Keeps magazine's regular \\"I Wish I'd Written...\\" feature, stating: \\"The writing is so marvellous that you can open the book at random and find a brilliant, memorable description\\".

It takes its name from the Lebombo Mountain range, on which it is situated. Derived from Zulu Lumbombo, ‚Äòhigh mountain ridge‚Äô. The Zulu name for this village is Obonjeni, ‚Äòon the big nose‚Äô, i.e. ‚Äòridge‚Äô. The site and remains believed to be those of the camp where Sir David Bruce and his wife Mary worked between 1894 and 1897, and where Bruce discovered the causative agent of nagana, African trypanosomiasis (\\"sleeping sickness\\") and its transmission by the tsetse fly were discovered here. Bethesda district hospital, founded by the Methodist Church is in this village. It started in 1932 and was initially built by Dr Robert Albert Turner who was the medical superintendent after being the District Surgeon and was a mission training hospital. From the early 1950s, three prominent business families engaged in trade and transportation in Ubombo. Bob Uekermann and his wife Hazel and Bob's stepson David Irons operated a trading store and a bus transportation company. Percy and Sybil Hoff operated the Tradewinds Store which still exists, while Herbert (Sonny) Hoff and his wife Nina operated a store and butchery next door to the Hoff business. Percy Hoff was a respected politician and member of the Council for Coloured Affairs, and was well known for his fight for social justice and rights of the coloured people. Percy Hoff eventually acquired Herbert Hoff's business and amalgamated the stores when Herbert's family left for present day Zimababwe in the late 1960s. Tradewinds was eventually sold to Nelson Thring when Percy Hoff moved his family to Swaziland and ultimately to Canada.

From 1969 to 1985, Rodr√≠guez Monegal was professor of Latin American contemporary literature at Yale University. He is usually called by his second surname Emir R. Monegal or Monegal (or erroneously Emir Rodr√≠guez-Monegal). Described as \\"one of the most influential Latin American literary critics of the 20th century\\" by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Monegal wrote key books about Pablo Neruda and Jorge Luis Borges, and the Britannica Macrop√¶dia notice of the later. He was a part in \\"The Boom\\" of 1960s Latin American literature as founder and 1966‚Äì1968 editor of his influential magazine Mundo Nuevo.

He had the double- barrelled name Rodr√≠guez Monegal (erroneously \\"Rodr√≠guez-Monegal\\" in some texts) but was often referred to as R. Monegal or Monegal only, a Spanish naming custom when the first surname is extremely common. From 1945 to 1957 (age 24 to 36), he edited the literary section of the Montevideo weekly Marcha. He was one of the first to recognize early on the importance of Borges,EB, tertiary sources. seeing him and his family frequently after 1945, and taking him for model to the point of pastiche.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a 1974, primary sources. Conversely, he got a cameo in a pseudo-autobiographical Borges short story: In 1949 (age 28), he won a scholarship from the British Council for a year's study at the University of Cambridge; he went to study under F. R. Leavis and complete a project on Andr√©s Bello. During 1949 to 1955 (age 28 to 34), he was also editor of N√∫mero, a Montevideo literary magazine. In 1952, he became friend with Pablo Neruda, who would later lend him his intimate papers for Monegal's biography of Neruda. In 1956 (age 35), Monegal obtained the equivalent of a PhD at the Facultad de Humanidades (Faculty of Letters), Montevideo, for his research on . Mundo Nuevo (1966‚Äì1968) In 1966 (age 45), Monegal founded the influential literary monthly Mundo Nuevo as a project sponsored by the Ford Foundation. Published in Spanish in Paris, it was distributed worldwide. Monegal directed it with full editorial control until July 1968, after a political smear campaign alleging a CIA funding eventually led to his resignation. Mundo Nuevo contributed to the 1960s publishing phenomenon dubbed \\"The Boom\\" in Latin American literature that led to many Latin American writers being published outside of their home countries and gaining critical recognition.Mac Adam 1984, primary sources. Yale University (1969‚Äì1985) In 1969 (age 48), Monegal was appointed professor of Latin American contemporary literature at Yale University. From 1970 to 1973 (age 49 to 52), he was chairman of the Latin American Studies program and associate chairman of the Department of Romance Languages. From 1973 to 1976 (age 49 to 55), he was chairman of the Spanish and Portuguese Department. From 1969 to 1977 (age 48 to 56), he was a member of the editorial board of Revista Iberoamericana (University of Pittsburgh) and from 1972 to 1977 (age 51 to 56) he was consulting editor of Review, a tri-quarterly published by the Center for Inter-American Relations in New York. Also, from 1975 to 1982 (age 54 to 61), he was a visiting lecturer in seven universities in Brazil, and a visiting professor at the University of Southern California and the University of Pittsburgh. In 1985 (aged 64), Monegal died on Thursday 14 November at Yale's infirmary in New Haven, Connecticut, USA.

Legacy * His 1966‚Äì1968 work with Mundo Nuevo, as well as his books and lectures, was influential for the spread of Latin American literature, launching the career of such as Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Severo Sarduy, and Manuel Puig, and contributing to the internationalization of writers such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Carlos Fuentes, and Mario Vargas Llosa. * His April 1968 article (reused in a chapter of his 1970 Borg√®s) introduced the concept of \\"Biorges\\". According to him, when Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges collaborated under the pseudonyms H. Bustos Domecq or B. Su√°rez Lynch, the results seemed written by a new personality, more than the sum of its parts, which he dubbed \\"Biorges\\" and considered in his own right as \\"one of the most important Argentine prose writers of his time\\", for having influenced writers such as Leopoldo Marechal (an otherwise anti-Borgesian), or Julio Cort√°zar's use of fictional language and slang in his masterpiece Hopscotch. Monegal 1968, primary sources. * His 1966 biography of his friend Pablo Neruda, who accepted to lend him his personal papers, remains a key book on the topic.

She was named for Thomaston, Maine, the home of General Henry Knox, the first Secretary of War to serve under the United States Constitution. Thomaston (LSD-28) was laid down on 3 March 1953 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 9 February 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Mathias B. Gardner; and commissioned on 17 September 1954, Captain Marion F. Ramirez de Arellano in command.  1955‚Äì1964  Following shakedown in the Caribbean, Thomaston transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet Amphibious Force. From July through October 1955, Thomaston participated in the Arctic Resupply Project, provisioning stations on the Distant Early Warning Line before taking part in cold-weather landing exercises in the Aleutians in November 1955 and again in January and February 1956. The landing ship's duties soon took her southward to the warmer climes of the Hawaiian Islands, where she conducted local operations and exercises in March and April. On hand in Santa Barbara, California, from 2 July to 9 July, for the Semana Nautica Celebration, Thomaston returned to the Hawaiian Islands and participated in three landing exercises in the autumn before returning to the west coast to conduct exercises off the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, California, during the spring of 1957. She subsequently deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac) in 1959 and participated in exercises off Borneo and Korea in June and August of that year. Alternating between the west coast and WestPac, Thomaston participated in a busy schedule of operations and cruises into the 1960s. During the international tensions brought on by the United States' discovery of Russian missile sites in Cuba, Thomaston sailed via the Panama Canal to the Caribbean and operated with the Atlantic Fleet until tensions abated with the withdrawal of the missiles. She then returned to San Diego on 15 December 1962. She commenced the year 1963 at her home port, NS San Diego, and conducted training exercises into February before serving as primary control ship off \\"Green\\" Beach, Del Mar, California, during Operation Steel Gate from 28 February to 8 March 1963. Thomaston departed the west coast on 26 March, bound for the Far East, and arrived via Pearl Harbor at Subic Bay on 20 April. Serving with the Amphibious Force of the 7th Fleet; she participated in special operations in the South China Sea from 22 April to 5 May. A second special operation in the South China Sea ‚Äî again with the Amphibious Ready Group, 7th Fleet ‚Äî took place in late August and early September. After operating in Okinawan waters, Thomaston departed Yokosuka, Japan, on 4 November, bound for the west coast of the United States. While en route three days later, the LSD received word of a merchantman in distress. Changing course, Thomaston found SS Barbara Fritchie in heavy seas, dead in the water, having lost a propeller and suffering rudder damage. Thomaston took her in tow and headed for Pearl Harbor, transferring the tow to on 12 November. The LSD's stop at Pearl Harbor was a brief one, though, as she arrived and departed for home on the same day, 15 November, making port at San Diego on 21 November, 1963  Vietnam War = 1964-1965  Thomaston operated locally and trained through the early fall of 1964, when she sailed for the Philippines on 26 October to commence another WestPac deployment. Arriving at Subic Bay on 16 November, the LSD conducted special operations in the South China Sea, including a dredge lift from Saigon to Da Nang, South Vietnam, between 21 November and 16 December. Christmas of that year found Thomaston again at sea, on \\"special operations\\" in the South China Sea. She was present at the initial Marine landings at Da Nang and Chu Lai, South Vietnam. She remained deployed to WestPac until June 1965, when she returned to San Diego to conduct routine local operations off the west coast. File:US_Amphibious_Ready_Group_TG_76-5_underway_1965.jpg  1966  Departing San Diego on 10 January 1966 for WestPac, Thomaston arrived in Vietnamese coastal waters on 5 February and immediately commenced operations at Chu Lai and Da Nang, serving as boat haven at the latter port. She returned to the United States in the spring and remained at San Diego from 9 April to 9 July 1966. The ship then headed back to the western Pacific and operated out of Subic Bay from 28 July through the end of the deployment. She participated in Operations Deckhouse III (phases one and two) and Deckhouse IV in August and September. In the former, Thomaston landed marines north of V≈©ng T√†u and served as primary control ship and boat haven during the subsequent operations. She then landed marines at a point just south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Vietnam. She thus continued in her familiar role as primary control ship and boat haven during \\"Deckhouse IV\\" and staged boat convoys carrying supplies up the Cua Viet River to ƒê√¥ng H√†. Returning to Subic Bay, Thomaston later participated in Exercise Mudpuppy II which was designed to provide training in river operations for marines. Held on Mindoro in the Philippines, \\"Mudpuppy II\\" ended three days before Christmas; and Thomaston sailed for Vietnam.  1967  She thus began the year 1967 as she had begun the previous year, in active combat operations against Viet Cong and People's Army of Vietnam units along the coastline. Participating in Deckhouse V and Deckhouse VI into March, Thomaston's participation in the former operation began on 5 January 1967 when she dropped anchor off the mouth of the C·ªï Chi√™n River. She helped to launch the thrust of \\"Deckhouse V\\", aimed at the delta lowlands of Ki·∫øn H√≤a Province, South Vietnam. The combined American and Vietnamese Marine Corps landings successfully challenged Viet Cong forces in this area. Relieved at V≈©ng T√†u by on 6 March, Thomaston sailed for repairs at Subic Bay, en route home via Hong Kong, Okinawa, Yokosuka, and Pearl Harbor.  1968  Following an extensive overhaul at San Diego from 28 June to 18 December 1967, Thomaston departed her home port on 21 February 1968 for her regular deployment to WestPac. After joining the Amphibious Ready Group off Vietnam in the I Corps zone, Thomaston commenced operations in support of marines of the Special Landing Forces (SLF) engaged ashore in the defense of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. She spent the month of March steaming in coastwise logistics runs between Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay and the burgeoning Army supply base at Wunder Beach. During her operations at the latter port, Thomaston demonstrated to the Army the versatility of the Landing Ship Dock by serving as an effective repair ship with a built-in drydock. Many small craft and pontoon piers serving the supply base received hull and machinery work by the crew in the ship's capacious well deck. During this deployment, Thomaston proved that the amphibious ship was a natural vehicle for inter-service cooperation. While operating off the coast of South Vietnam with the Amphibious Ready Group, Thomaston conducted two search and rescue operations. On the evening of 25 May, a CH-46 helicopter, loaded with mail, passengers, and baggage, lost power in the vicinity of and crashed. The helicopter remained afloat while those on board jettisoned all excess weight. It gradually sank, but fortunately not before all men had safely left the craft. Within a mile of the accident Thomaston dispatched two boats to the scene and recovered not only four of the passengers and crew of the CH-46 (the remainder were picked up by helicopter) but the crew from one of Valley Forge's boats which had capsized upon launching. Later, on 2 June and again while in the vicinity of Valley Forge, Thomaston picked up men from the carrier who had jumped overboard to escape flames from a flight deck fire. Thomaston next participated in Badger Catch III, the withdrawal of the Special Landing Force from the Cua Viet River area bordering on the extreme southern edge of the DMZ. Subsequently, Thomaston and her embarked SLF participated in a swift succession of operations against Communist ground forces. Operation Swift Sabre plunged into Viet Cong-contested areas of the western shore of Da Nang harbor on 8 June 1968. Following Exercise Hilltop XX in Subic Bay, Thomaston participated in Eager Yankee which landed elements of the SLF in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province near Cua Tu Hien on 9 July before engaging, 13 days later, in Swift Play in the coastal area south of Da Nang. These operations resulted in the capture of significant numbers of weapons and stores and the destruction of operating bases and installations from which the enemy had launched attacks against other \\"friendly forces\\". During \\"Swift Play\\", Thomaston came under shore battery fire for a brief time.  1969‚Äì1974  For the next five years, Thomaston actively supported the war effort in Vietnam, conducted troop and cargo lifts, and participated in amphibious operations. The tide of war, however, was running against the South Vietnamese; and, by the spring of 1975, concentrated efforts on the part of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops put pressure on the crumbling South Vietnamese government.  1975  The end for South Vietnam came during Thomaston's 15th WestPac deployment. The beginning of the year 1975 found the landing ship at Subic Bay, undergoing a needed availability. She departed Subic Bay on 2 February, bound for Singapore where she stayed until 13 February. As a member of Task Group (TG) 76.4 Thomaston later returned to port at Subic Bay on 25 February. Her anticipated upkeep period, however, was cut short when the ship was directed to return to sea with TG 76.4. On 2 March, Thomaston departed Subic Bay to execute Operation Eagle Pull which evacuated Americans and designated Cambodian citizens from the capital city of Phnom Penh. The civilians were to be picked up by helicopters and ferried to the ships offshore. She remained in readiness until the evening of 5 April, when Thomaston was ordered to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc island to assist Vietnamese nationals evacuated from Da Nang. She transferred food and medical supplies via her LCUs and LCM-8 assault craft to Vietnamese refugees quartered on Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels. TG 76.4 executed \\"Eagle Pull\\" on 12 April, and Thomaston took part as a plane guard on station to the south. Upon the successful completion of the operation, designated units of the group proceeded to Sattahip, Thailand, to debark civilians airlifted from Cambodia. Meanwhile, Thomaston sailed for the Philippines, arriving at Subic Bay on the morning of 17 April, but her much deserved in-port period was again abbreviated by operational necessity. Underway once more at 23:30 on 18 April, Thomaston sailed for Vietnamese waters to take part in the evacuation of the besieged capital, Saigon. On 29 April, Operation Frequent Wind commenced at 15:00. During the next nine hours Thomaston received 811 Vietnamese, American, and other refugees. During this operation ‚Äî for which the ship received the Meritorious Unit Commendation ‚Äî Thomaston received evacuees via helicopter, landing helicopters as large as CH-46's on her flight deck aft. All Vietnamese citizens were to be processed and placed aboard MSC ships. American citizens would be retained on board for transportation to the Philippines. Although limited by space, all individuals were provided with food, clothing, and medical attention. Makeshift shelters, \\"tents\\" made from marines' blankets, were set up on board. Returning to Subic Bay on 3 May, Thomaston immediately commenced preparations for her homeward voyage. Civilians embarked during Frequent Wind were debarked at Subic Bay. The ship then headed on for the west coast of the United States, via Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and Pearl Harbor; and arrived at San Diego on 6 June 1975.  1975‚Äì1998  Thomaston subsequently operated with the Pacific Fleet in 1976, conducting training and local operations in waters off Okinawa, Japan, Korea, and Hawaii, before returning to San Diego at the close of the year. Following a material inspection by the Navy Board of Inspection and Survey in January 1977, Thomaston commenced preparations for her forthcoming overhaul. On 1 June, she entered Todd Shipyard, Seattle, for the most extensive overhaul conducted on an amphibious ship to that time. Lasting 18 months and costing nearly $30 million, the overhaul was completed on 7 December 1978. Thomaston returned to her home port of San Diego on 14 December. In February 1980 Thomaston and her crew received the Humanitarian Service Medal for her part in the radioactive cleanup operations on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific. During USS Thomaston's 1981 Westpac as part of Amphibious Squadron Five, the ship and crew would receive a second Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of 77 Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea in April 1981. During this cruise she would make her only visit to Perth/Fremantle, Australia, from 28 May to 2 June 1981. USS Thomaston began her final deployment on 17 January 1984, making port calls at Manila, PI, Hong Kong, Pusan (Busan), South Korea and Pearl Harbor HI, all the while conducting exercises with three major exercises along with exercises with South Korean and Philippines naval units. USS Thomaston returned home to San Diego CA on 27 July 1984, completing 30 years of service. USS Thomaston was decommissioned 28 September 1984 and her name struck from the Naval Vessel Register 2 February 1992, and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, under temporary custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD). The vessel was sold 29 September 1995 by MARAD to Pegasus Inc., but repossessed by the Navy, 1 July 1997. Permanent custody was reassigned to MARAD, 18 November 1998 for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. On 28 July 2011, Thomaston was sold by MARAD to All Star Metals of Brownsville, Tx for $894,708 to be dismantled.https://voa.marad.dot.gov/Solicitation_Awards/docs/mar-610/MA-14148-Sales- THOMASTON%20SIGNED.pdf Thomaston departed the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 18 August 2011 to be cleaned by Allied Defense Recycling at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard.http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/i110930.pdf Thomaston was towed to Brownsville upon completion of the cleaning and has been scrapped.

M. E. McTaggart (1866‚Äì1925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence.J. M. E. McTaggart, \\"The Unreality of Time\\", Mind 17: 457‚Äì73; reprinted in J. M. E. McTaggart, The Nature of Existence, Vol. 2, 1927, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: Book 5, Chapter 33. The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016). It is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all. The phenomenological analysis: the A- and B-series To frame his argument, McTaggart initially offers a phenomenological analysis of how time appears to us in experience. Time appears, he says, in the form of events standing in temporal positions, of which there are two kinds. On the one hand events are earlier than and later than each other, and on the other hand they are future, present, and past, and continually changing their position in terms of futurity, presentness, and pastness. The two kinds of temporal positions each represent events in time as standing in a certain order which McTaggart chooses to call the A-series and the B-series. The A-series represents the series of positions determined as future, present, and past, and which continuously pass from the distant future towards the present, and through the present into the remote past. The B-series represents the series of positions determined as earlier than or later than each other. The determinations of the B-series hold between the events in time, and never change. If an event ever is earlier or later than some other event, then their respective position in time never changes. The determinations of the A-series must hold to something outside of time, something that does not itself change its position in time, but in relation to which the events in time pass from being future, present, and past. Surprisingly, McTaggart does not suggest the present, or NOW, as this something whose position in time is fixed and unchanging. He just says that it will be difficult to identify any such entity (seeing as it is outside time). Broad explains that McTaggart believed that the difficulty of identifying this entity was serious enough in its own right to be persuaded that time is unreal, but thinks that the contradiction of the A-series is still more convincing, wherefore he leaves this particular difficulty aside.Broad 1938: p. 317-8 The atemporality of the B-series McTaggart argues that the conception of time as only forming a B-series is inadequate because the B-series does not change, and change is of the essence of time. If any conception of reality represents it as changeless, then this is a conception of an atemporal reality. The B-series does not change because earlier-later relationships never change (e.g. the year 2010 is always later than 2000). The events that form a B-series must therefore also form an A-series in order to count as being in time, i.e. they must pass from future to present, and from present to past, in order to change. The A- and B-series are not mutually exclusive. If events form an A-series they automatically also form a B-series (anything in the present is earlier than anything in the future, and later than everything past). The question is not therefore whether time forms an A- or a B-series; the question is whether time forms both an A- and a B-series, or only a B-series. The proponents of the B-view of time typically respond by arguing that even if events do not change their positions in the B-series, it does not follow that there can be no change in the B-series. This conclusion only follows if it is assumed that events are the only entities that can change. There can be change in the B-series in the form of objects bearing different properties at different times (Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 & 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002).e.g. as argued by: Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 & 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002 The suggestion that the B-view of time can escape the problem by appealing to particulars that endure through time and have different properties at different times is controversial in its own right, but it is generally assumed that this is a controversy that has nothing to do with McTaggart. Instead it is treated as a separate issue, the question of whether things can endure in B-time. However, as Ingthorsson has argued, McTaggart does discuss variation in the properties of persistent entities in the 1st Volume of The Nature of Existence, and there comes to the conclusion that variation in the properties of things between times is not change but mere variation between the temporal parts of things (Ingthorsson 2001). The contradiction of the A-series Attacking the A-series, McTaggart argues that any event in the A-series is past, present, and future, which is contradictory in that each of those properties excludes the other two. McTaggart admits that the contradictory nature of the A-series may not be obvious, because it would appear that events never are simultaneously future, present, and past, but only successively so. However, there is a contradiction, he insists, because any attempt to explain why they are future, present, and past, at different times is (i) circular because we would need to describe the successive order of those \\"different times\\" again by invoking the determinations of being future, present or past, and (ii) this in turn will inevitably lead to a vicious infinite regress. The vicious infinite regress arises, because to explain why the second appeal to future, present, and past, doesn't lead again to the same difficulty all over, we need to explain that they in turn apply successively and thus we must again explain that succession by appeal to future, present, and past, and there is no end to such an explanation. It is the validity of the argument in favour of a vicious infinite regress that has received the most attention in 20th Century philosophy of time. In the later version of the argument, in The Nature of Existence,McTaggart 1927: ch. 33 McTaggart no longer advances the circularity objection. This is, arguably, because by then he has come to treat tense as a simple and indefinable notion, and thus cannot contend that the terms need to be explained at all in order to be applied. He now instead argues that even if it is admitted that they are simple and indefinable, and thus can be applied without further analysis, they still lead to contradiction. Philosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart's argument against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction.For instance: Dummett 1960; Mellor 1981 & 1998; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1992 On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two of the most commonly invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the phenomenology of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent.Gotschalk 1930; Broad 1938: 313; Oakley 1946-7; Prior 1967: 5‚Äì6; Christensen 1974; Baldwin 1999. Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the semantics of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like \\"M is present, has been future, and will be past\\" can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that M is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because \\"has been\\" and \\"will be\\" indicate that we are not talking about how M currently is, but instead of how M once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to M of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987). Ingthorsson has argued that the reason for this incommensurability between the proponents of the A- and B-views is found in the prevailing view that McTaggart's argument is a stand-alone argument. If it is read in that way, the proponents of each view will understand the argument against the background of their respective views of time, and come to incompatible conclusions (1998 & 2016). Indeed, on closer scrutiny it will be found that McTaggart explicitly claims that in \\"The Unreality of Time\\" he is inquiring whether reality can have the characteristics it appears to have in experience (notably being temporal and material) given his earlier conclusions about what reality must really be like in Absolute Reality. In the introduction to the 2nd Volume of The Nature of Existence, he says: > Starting from our conclusions as to the general nature of the existent, as > reached in the earlier Books, we shall have to ask, firstly which of these > characteristics can really be possessed by what is existent, and which of > them, in spite of the prim√¢ facie appearance to the contrary, cannot be > possessed by anything existent (1927: sect. 295). And he continues: > It will be possible to show that, having regard to the general nature of the > existent as previously determined, certain characteristics, that we consider > here for the first time, cannot be true of the existent (1927: sect. 298). As Ingthorsson notes, the most central result of McTaggart's earlier inquiry into the general nature of the existent in Absolute Reality, an inquiry McTaggart claims is based entirely on a priori arguments (i.e. such as do not rely on any empirical observations), is that existence and reality coincide and have no degrees: either something exists and thus is real, or it does not. It immediately follows that for the future and past to be real, they must exist. This is why he interprets the statement \\"M is present, has been future, and will be past\\" as a statement about M existing in the present bearing the property of being present, and existing in the past bearing the property of being future, and existing in the future bearing the property of being past. This interpretation of the expression, if correct, does say that M is future, present, and past, which is contradictory. However, since it starts from the premise that the future and past can only be real by existing, then it remains to show that this is what the A-view of time assumes. The C-series Having come to the conclusion that reality can neither form an A- nor a B-series, despite appearances to the contrary, then McTaggart finds it necessary to explain what the world is really like such that it appears to be different from what it appears to be. Here is where the C-series comes into play. McTaggart does not say much about the C-series in the original journal article, but in The Nature of Existence he devotes six whole chapters to discuss it (1927: Chs. 44‚Äì9). The C-series is rarely given much attention. When it is mentioned, it is described as \\"an expression synonymous with 'B-series' when the latter is shorn of its temporal connotations\\" (Shorter 1986: 226). There is a grain of truth in this, but there is more to the C-series than this. Stripping the temporal features from the B-series only gives what the C- and B-series have minimally in common, notably the constituents of the series and the formal characteristics of being linear, asymmetric, and transitive. However, the C-series has features that the B-series does not have. The constituents of the C-series are mental states (a consequence of McTaggart's argument in Ch. 34 of The Nature of Existence that reality cannot really be material), which are related to each other on the basis of their conceptual content in terms of being included in and inclusive of (1927: sect. 566 & Ch. 60). These atemporal relations are meant to provide what the earlier/later than relation cannot, notably explain why an illusion of change and temporal succession can arise in an atemporal reality.  Influence  McTaggart's argument has had an enormous influence on the philosophy of time. His phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time has been accepted as good and true even by those who firmly deny the end conclusion that time is unreal. For instance, J. S. Findlay (1940) and A. Prior (1967) took McTaggart's phenomenological analysis as their point of departure in the development of modern tense logic. McTaggart's characterisation of the appearance of time in terms of the A- and B-series served to sharpen the contrast between the two emerging and rival views of time that we now know as the A- and B-views of time. The assumption is that the A-view, in accepting the reality of tense, represent time as being like an A-series, and that the B-view, in rejecting the reality of tense, represent time as being like a B-series. The two objections that McTaggart develops against the conception of time as forming an A- and a B-series are still the two main objections with which the A- and B-views of time struggle. Is the A-view contradictory, and is the B-view able to incorporate an account of change. The controversy about McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time continues unabated (see, for instance, Smith 2011; Cameron 2015; Mozersky 2015; Ingthorsson 2016). Editions * J. M. E.

In heavily congested traffic, natural breaks occur rarely, thus the term traffic break most commonly refers to the manual separation of traffic, normally conducted by highway patrol officers. Most such traffic breaks are used to clear a hazardous obstruction from the road or to allow a stalled vehicle to safely make its way off the road and onto the shoulder. For example, a highway patrol officer may arrive at the site of the accident and then radio to another officer to initiate a traffic break. The second officer enters traffic before the site of the accident, turns on their warning lights, and begins weaving across multiple lanes to signal that other drivers are to slow down and remain behind the officer. The speed to which the officer slows is based on the amount of time needed to clear the accident ahead. An officer may completely stop traffic to yield larger separation. The second officer then radios ahead to the first officer, who is still at the site of the accident, and gives them a description of the last vehicle traveling ahead at regular speeds. The first officer will use this information to determine when it is safe to move the accident off the road and onto the shoulder. Traffic breaks may also be conducted to gradually slow traffic in preparation for a large accident ahead that has caused traffic to stop abruptly. This greatly reduces the chance of subsequent crashes due to motorists not braking in time. Other traffic breaks may give time for construction activities to be completed uninterrupted. Some construction requires equipment that obstructs the flow of traffic to a point that it becomes a major hazard to have traffic trying to travel around them, such as adjusting the placement of a traffic sign, (re)striping lane markers, or sweeping the roadway. Alternatively, some construction would produce dangerous conditions to passing vehicles, such as blasting. In very rare circumstances, civilian motorists have initiated traffic breaks. In 2004, one Alameda County man ran a traffic break to aid in the emergency landing of a small Cessna 172 on Interstate 580. When a single traffic break does not allow sufficient time to complete a task, multiple breaks may be conducted in series. This practice is called \\"running a round-robin\\". During times of high congestion, risky driving, or dangerous road conditions, law enforcement may institute so-called \\"rolling roadblocks,\\" where official vehicles line up across the road and drive at a set speed. Since anyone attempting to pass them would be doing so on the shoulder and thereby garnering a ticket from the officer, traffic speeds are kept at the desired level.  Traffic breaks by vehicles other than automobiles  Some traffic breaks have been initiated by vehicles other than automobiles. For example, a motorboat driver initiated a traffic break in the Rivi√®re des Prairies in order to keep marine traffic away from police operations following a helicopter prison escape from the Saint- J√©r√¥me Detention Facility in 2013.CBC News Montreal, 6pm newscast, originally broadcast on March 21, 2013. In fiction, Thomas the Tank Engine initiated a traffic break by rapidly shifting between tracks to keep his competitors from winning a hypothetical stunt competition. Furthermore, in the book The No Cussing Club by McKay Hatch, two characters conceive of a scenario whereby a hovercraft in Scandinavia is able to initiate a traffic break during a police narcotics operation.

Launched on August 10, 1992, it was the first major oceanographic research satellite. TOPEX/Poseidon helped revolutionize oceanography by providing data previously impossible to obtain. Oceanographer Walter Munk described TOPEX/Poseidon as \\"the most successful ocean experiment of all time.\\"Munk.W.: Testimony Before the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, April 2002, http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/oceancommission/meetings/apr18_19_02/munk_statement.pdf A malfunction ended normal satellite operations in January 2006. Description Before TOPEX/Poseidon, scientists had only a brief glimpse of Earth's ocean as a whole from the pioneering but short-lived Seasat satellite. TOPEX/Poseidon' radar altimeter provided the first continuous global coverage of the surface topography of the oceans. From orbit 1,330 kilometers above Earth, TOPEX/Poseidon provided measurements of the surface height of 95 percent of the ice-free ocean to an accuracy of 3.3 centimeters. The satellite's measurements of the hills and valleys of the sea surface led to a fundamentally new understanding of ocean circulation and its effect on climate. The mission's most important achievement was to determine the patterns of ocean circulation - how heat stored in the ocean moves from one place to another. Since the ocean holds most of the Earth's heat from the Sun, ocean circulation is a driving force of climate. TOPEX/Poseidon made it possible for the first time to compare computer models of ocean circulation with actual global observations and use the data to improve climate predictions. While a three-year prime mission was planned, TOPEX/Poseidon delivered more than 10 years of data from orbit. In those years, the mission: * Measured sea level with an unprecedented accuracy * Mapped global tides for the first time * Monitored effects of currents on global climate change and produced the first global views of seasonal changes of currents * Monitored large-scale ocean features like Rossby and Kelvin waves and studied such phenomena as El Ni√±o, La Ni√±a, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation * Mapped basin-wide current variations and provided global data to validate models of ocean circulation * Mapped year-to-year changes in heat stored in the upper ocean * Improved our knowledge of Earth's gravity field * Observed the temperature of the ocean and main seas for over a period of 10 years TOPEX/Poseidon was launched using an Ariane 42P expendable launch vehicle, along with Korea Institute of Technology's Kitsat-1 satellite and France's S80/T satellite . Lift-off from Kourou in French Guiana took place on 1992-08-10. At lift-off the mass of the satellite was . The mission was named after the ocean TOPography EXperiment and the Greek god of the ocean Poseidon. In October 2005 after more than 62,000 orbits, TOPEX/Poseidon stopped providing science data after a momentum wheel malfunctioned, and the satellite was turned off on January 18, 2006.  Measurements continue  TOPEX/Poseidon's follow-on mission, Jason-1, was launched in 2001 to continue the ongoing measurements of sea surface topography. The two satellites, TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1, flew in a tandem mission for three years providing twice the coverage of the sea surface and allowing scientists to study smaller features than could be seen by one satellite. The record of global sea surface height begun by TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 continues into the future with the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on the Jason-2 satellite, which launched in June 2008. The Jason-3 mission launched January 17, 2016.  Instruments  TOPEX/Poseidon flew two onboard altimeters sharing the same antenna, but only one altimeter was operated at any time, with TOPEX given preference (on average 9 in 10 cycles during the first 10 years of the mission). * TOPEX: The NASA-built Nadir pointing Radar Altimeter using C band (5.3 GHz) and Ku band (13.6 GHz) for measuring height above sea surface. * Poseidon: The CNES-built solid state Nadir pointing Radar Altimeter using Ku band (13.65 GHz). leftIn addition to the altimeters, the TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR) operating at 18, 21, and 37 GHz was used to correct for atmospheric wet path delay. The satellite was also equipped with instruments to accurately pinpoint its location. Precise orbit determination is crucial because errors in locating the spacecraft would distort the sea level measurement calculated from the altimeter readings. Three independent tracking systems determined the position of the spacecraft. The first, the NASA laser retroreflector array (LRA) reflected laser beams from a network of 10 to 15 ground-based laser ranging stations under clear skies. The second, for all-weather, global tracking, was provided by the CNES Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite tracking system receiver (DORIS). This device uses microwave doppler techniques (changes in radio frequency corresponding to relative velocity) to track the spacecraft. DORIS consists of an on-board receiver and a global network of 40 to 50 ground-based transmitting stations. The third system used an on-board experimental Global Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver to precisely determine the satellite's position continuously by analyzing the signals received from the U.S Air Force's GPS constellation of Earth-orbiting satellites. TOPEX/Poseidon was the first mission to demonstrate that the Global Positioning System could be used to determine a spacecraft's exact location and track it in orbit. Knowing the satellite's precise position to within 2 centimeters (less than 1 inch) in altitude was a key component in making accurate ocean height measurements possible. A number of satellites (See links) use exotic dual-band radar altimeters to measure height from a spacecraft. That measurement, coupled with orbital elements (possibly from GPS), enables determination of the topography. The two lengths of radio waves permit the altimeter to automatically correct for varying delays in the ionosphere. Use of information TOPEX/Poseidon's data have been the subject of more than 2,100 research publications.

Ryan is the former president of the Ontario Federation of Labour. Biography Born in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, and third eldest of ten children, Ryan emigrated to Canada at age 22. He and his wife Sheila have three daughters: Lisa, Susie, and Amanda. Ryan helped to organize a United Steelworkers of America (USWA) local where he worked shortly after arriving in Canada. He has been a Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) activist since he went to work for Ontario Hydro in 1976. He served as CUPE Ontario president from 1992 to 2009, representing 225,000 workers in the public sector. CUPE Ontario added 75,000 new members under Ryan's leadership. CUPE is the Canada's largest and fastest growing union with nearly 600,000 members. CUPE Ontario is the largest provincial division. Ryan also served as general vice-president of CUPE National until 2009. Under Ryan‚Äôs leadership, CUPE Ontario focused on issues such as privatization, forced mergers, cutbacks, restructuring, healthcare, free post secondary education, universal childcare international solidarity and human rights. Ryan continues to lead major campaigns and proactively influence policy and legislative decisions in health care, municipal, school board, social service, and university sectors. He is a proponent of increasing the accessibility of university education across Ontario. Ryan appeared weekly for 10 years on Michael Coren Live and CHEX-TV Durham, CFRB 1010 and writes a bi-weekly column for the Toronto Sun. He is also a frequent guest on TVOntario‚Äôs current affairs programs, The Agenda with Steve Paikin CBC TV and radio , CTV , CP24. HE has written op ed pieces for all the major Canadian newspapers.He is a frequent speaker in the Canadian labour movement. Ryan has been recruited by human rights groups to act as a Canadian peace observer in Northern Ireland, to march alongside members of the United Farm Workers in California, he went to Texas with Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter to lobby Texas politicians for a commutation of Stanley Faulder's death sentence, he championed the rights of Palestinians and was instrumental in having CUPE Ontario support the BDS campaign in order to exert peaceful pressure on the State of Israel to end the conflict with Palestine. He worked tirelessly with unions from across Canada and South America to defeat the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA). He has worked for the New Democratic Party during every election since arriving in Canada. He ran for the party provincially in 1999, 2003 and 2007, as well as federally in 2004 and 2006. He is the recipient of the Canada 125 Medal, presented to Canadian citizens for their contributions to the good of the community and society in general. In November 2009, Ryan was acclaimed to the position of president of the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL). He was re-elected for a second term in 2011 and again in 2013 and retired in 2015. During his six years as OFL president 4 unions undemocratically withheld union dues from the OFL because they disagreed with Ryan's leadership from the first day he was elected. Canada's largest private sector union, Unifor, which had supported him in the past, refused to support his re-election to a fourth term and instead supported a Unifor staff person who worked for Unifor President Jerry Dias.https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/22/ofl-president-sid-ryan-to- call-it-quits.html Work with New Democratic Party Queen's Park in Toronto in 2009 In addition to his union activities, Ryan has been involved with the New Democratic Party (NDP) since the 1980s. He has served on the Ontario NDP's provincial council and Environment committee, and is a former president of the Durham Centre riding association. Ryan's affiliation with the Ontario NDP became tenuous in the early 1990s, when some felt that the party had moved to the right under Bob Rae's leadership. On one occasion, he referred to the Rae government's austerity \\"Social Contract\\" bill as the most anti-labour piece of legislation he had ever seen. He subsequently resumed supporting the provincial party under Howard Hampton's leadership in a bid to rebuild the NDP/Labour relationship. Ryan has stood as an NDP candidate in three provincial and two federal election campaigns. He contested Scarborough Centre in the 1999 provincial election, and finished third behind Progressive Conservative incumbent Marilyn Mushinski and Liberal Costas Manios. In the 2003 provincial election, he campaigned in Oshawa and came within 1,109 votes of defeating PC incumbent Jerry Ouellette. Ryan moved the NDP's vote from around 5000 to over 18,000 during the course of his campaigns in Oshawa. Ryan also stood as a candidate for Oshawa in the 2004 federal election, and lost to Conservative Colin Carrie by 463 votes in a very close three-way race. He ran again in the 2006 election, but, despite considerable support from the federal NDP leader Jack Layton lost by 2,802 votes to incumbent Carrie. During the last few days of the 2006 election campaign, Alan Clarke, the \\"sign manager\\" for the Colin Carrie Campaign distributed a flyer reminding the Membership of CAW Local 222 that the Local was prohibited from supporting Ryan's campaign by a 1993 binding referendum. The flyer showed Ryan and several others having a beer with Alex Maskey the former Lord Mayor of Belfast who was reportedly twice interned for being a member of the IRA. Maskey later became Lord Mayor of Belfast. The flyer also had photos of a bombing in Omagh a town in Ireland and a photo of para military soldier with a rocket launcher on his shoulder Carrie's campaign denied being involved, with manager Andrew Morin suggesting that the leaflet was a product of union squabbling over an endorsement by the Canadian Auto Workers. Morin and Ryan stated that the two campaigns were otherwise on good terms. Elections Canada laid two charges of breaching the Elections Act against Clarke, while Ryan also filed a civil suit. Clarke was later found innocent of the Elections Canada charges and filed a counter-suit against Ryan. Ryan was successful with his lawsuit against Clarke and the Judge ordered Clarke to take out a quarter page ad in The Oshawa This Week newspaper apologising to Ryan and his family for defaming him in the flyer. Clarke was also ordered to pay a sum of money to a charity of Ryan's choice. Ryan alleged that Clarke was working on Carrie's 2006 campaign, which Morin had earlier denied.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-13872023http://newsdurhamregion.com/news/breaking_news/article/98905http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/people/biography/mpeople.htmAlex Maskeyhttp://newsdurhamregion.com/article/48058 In the 2007 Ontario provincial election, Ryan challenged Ouellette for the second time, losing by over 2500 votes, a larger margin than in 2003. Ryan considered running for the leadership of the federal NDP in 2017 but declined due to his not being able to speak French, and instead endorsed Niki Ashton.https://ipolitics.ca/2017/04/27/ex-union-leader-sid-ryan-not-entering- ndp-race-endorses-niki-ashton/ OMERS and Bill 206 For more than 10 years Ryan waged a battle with the provincial government to change the governance of the OMERS pension plan. Ryan wanted the government to allow the stakeholders to have control over investments and day-to-day governance of the plan. Pension surpluses were not being used to raise pensions for some plan members. In 2006, Ryan threatened a political strike after Premier Dalton McGuinty brought in Bill 206, which would change the administration of OMERS but would not fully address CUPE's concerns. However, this met with resistance from a small number of CUPE locals. The employer organization AMO (Association of Municipalities Ontario), together with OMERS administrators fought, to stop Ryan's campaign. McGuinty agreed to make some changes to address CUPE's concerns but refused to withdraw the bill. In September 2008, Ryan was appointed to the Board of Directors of OMERS. OMERS is the 4th largest pension plan in Canada with assets of around $50B. Unbottle It Campaign=Tap Into Public Drinking Water In early 2009, CUPE Ontario's Sid Ryan and The Council of Canadians' Maude Barlow teamed up in a 15 city tour of Ontario to promote public drinking water systems and to oppose the bottled water industry. Barlow had just been appointed a senior advisor on water to the President of the UN General Assembly. The ultimate goal of the campaign was to have the Ontario Government initiate a ban on the sale of bottled water in public buildings and facilities such as schools, universities, municipal buildings and hospitals. The campaign was successful in getting London City Council to sponsor a resolution to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) urging the FCM to call upon all municipalities to consider phasing out the sale and purchase of bottled water from their facilities. The tour saw great turnouts at stops in Windsor, London, Guelph, Hamilton, St. Catharines, Ottawa, Kingston, Midland, Waterloo, Owen Sound, Brockville, Cobourg, Whitby, Toronto, and Peterborough. \\"When we don‚Äôt care what happens to our water treatment plants, the same thing can happen with water as what happened to health care in the United States,\\"http://www.simcoe.com/article/127458 said Ryan, in Midland. Since the tour, Ontario saw full or partial bans in a number of communities. Niagara Falls voted to stop selling bottled water at city facilities, despite last-minute lobbying efforts from Nestle Waters Canada. \\"When a city with the international profile of Niagara Falls recognizes this, and recognizes its responsibility to improve access to public water supplies, the days of bottled water are numbered across Canada and around the world\\", said Barlow.http://www.thespec.com/article/519511 With the first phase of the tour declared a huge success, CUPE Ontario added a Northern Ontario phase that spring. Unbottle it! planned to be in Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Kenora, Thunder Bay and North Bay in April.  Foreign policy = Israel  Ireland  Sid Ryan has a long-standing involvement with the Irish peace process, including acting as three-time International Peace Observer to the process between the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party and the Sinn F√©in. He has written a number of columns and pieces on the violence in his homeland, including an article in the Toronto Sun titled \\"The Orange, the Green ... and 'the troubles. During the 2004 federal election campaign, in which he ran as an NDP candidate, a Conservative Party member produced a leaflet featured a picture of Ryan standing beside Alec Maskey, former Lord Mayor of Belfast. The leaflet was thought to imply that the photo was taken at a Friends of Sinn F√©in fundraiser. In response, Ryan's campaign team released a press release emphasizing that the photo was taken at a fundraiser for the Ireland Fund of Canada, a non profit and non partisan charitable organization. In 2007, Sid Ryan introduced Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams on the Toronto stop of Adams' speaking tour of North America. Adams was in Toronto to thank those that contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Awards Sid Ryan was awarded the Canadian Arab Federation's Social Justice Award at their 40th anniversary dinner held in Toronto on June 16, 2007. Ryan was recognised for his work as an International Peace Observer in Northern Ireland and his championing of Palestinian rights, specifically, his strong support for CUPE Ontario's Resolution 50 which calls for union members to support the international campaign of boycott, diverstment and sanctions against Israel.

It is located east of Cologne. The town is famous for its first league handball team VfL Gummersbach. History In 1109 Gummersbach was mentioned in official documents for the first time. The document in question concerned the lowering of the episcopal tax for the church in Gummersbach by Archbishop Frederick I. At that time the name of the town was spelled as Gumeresbracht. Gummersbach received town privileges in 1857. In 1855 Gummersbach's industrial history began with the foundation of the company Steinm√ºller. With the company's success the little village began to grow to a town. After going out of business most of the company's area was unused. Due to the fact that by the time this area made up half of the downtown area the town of Gummersbach bought this area to develop it. Today (2016) a multifunctional arena, a shopping mall, university buildings and offices have already been built. The coat of arms The arms were granted on July 27, 1892. Gummersbach developed rapidly from a small village to a large town during the early 19th century, due to the metal and textile industry. The right part of the arms thus show a spindle as a symbol for the textile industry. The left part shows the arms of the Counts of the Mark, as the area belonged to the Mark since 1287.

A tide gauge is a device for measuring the change in sea level relative to a vertical datum. It its also known as mareograph, marigraph, sea-level recorder and limnimeter. Operation Sensors continuously record the height of the water level with respect to a height reference surface close to the geoid. Water enters the device by the bottom pipe (far end of the tube, see picture), and electronic sensors measure its height and send the data to a tiny computer. Historical data are available for about 1,450 stations worldwide, of which about 950 have provided updates to the global data center since January 2010. At some places records cover centuries, for example in Amsterdam where data dating back to 1700 is available. When it comes to estimating the greater ocean picture, new modern tide gauges can often be improved upon by using satellite data. Tide gauges are used to measure tides and quantify the size of tsunamis. The measurements make it possible to derive the mean sea level. Using this method, sea level slopes up to several 0.1 m/1000 km and more have been detected. A tsunami can be detected when the sea level begins to rise, although warnings from seismic activity can be more useful. History Sea-level measurements were made using simple measuring poles or \\"tide staffs\\" until around 1830, when self-recording gauges with mechanical floats and stilling wells were introduced.Tide gauge history UK National Oceanographic Centre Tidal poles and float gauges were the primary means of sea-level measurement for over 150 years and continue to operate at some locations today. While still part of modern-day tide gauge instrumentation, these technologies have since been superseded by pressure gauges, acoustic/ultrasonic gauges, and radar gauges. The following types of tide gauges have been used historically: * Kelvin type tide gauge * Fuess type tide gauge * GSI type tide gauge * High accuracy automatic tide gauge * High resolution automatic tide gauge Common applications Interior view of Cascais Tide Gauge showing data recording equipment Tide gauges have a practical application in the shipping and fishing industries where low or high tide levels can hinder or prohibit access to shallow bays or locations with bridges. An example is the Cascais tide gauge in Portugal, which was originally installed because of the sand bar in the River Tagus that causes difficulties for shipping entering Lisbon port. Because of similar problems many industries have installed private tide gauges in ports around the world, and also rely on government agencies (such as NOAA). Data collected from tide gauges is also of interest to scientists measuring global weather patterns, the mean sea water level, and trends - notably those potentially associated with global warming. Modern gauges In recent years new technologies have developed allowing for real-time, remote tide information to be published online via a solar powered wireless connection to a tide sensor. Acoustic/ultrasonic sensors have already been deployed to great effect and the data is regularly broadcast via Twitter and also displayed online.

It is the largest surviving Pictish stone of its type in Scotland and stands over 7 metres (about 23 feet) high. It is situated on a raised bank on a now isolated section of the former road to Findhorn. The stone is named after Sweyn Forkbeard, but this association has been challenged and it has also been associated with the killing of King Duffus. Possible second pillar Evidence from Timothy Pont's Mapp of Murray (c 1590), the more modern military maps of Roy and Ainslie (1750 and 1789 respectively) and Robert Campbell's map of 1790 all show Sueno's Stone along with another stone that has now disappeared. The fact that Pont's map shows the standing stones at all indicates their size as Pont does not show any other obelisks anywhere. Ainslie has inscribed on his map \\"two curiously carved pillars\\". The fact that these maps show the pillar(s) in their present (at least approximate) position belies the notion that it was found elsewhere and re-erected at its present location.McCullagh: Excavations at Sueno's Stone, Forres, Moray, 1995 Hector Boece (c1465‚Äì1536) (not known entirely for his historical accuracy) mentions the stone and attributes it to Sueno. Lady Ann Campbell, the Countess of Moray, is noted in the early 1700s as carrying out maintenance on the stone in an attempt to stabilise it. This was achieved by constructing stepped plinths around the base and these are what can be seen today. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1990 and 1991 suggest that it may originally have been one of two monumental stones. Description Details of base of stone Sueno's Stone is an upright cross slab with typical Pictish style interwoven vine symbols on the edge panels. It is carved from Old Red Sandstone which is prevalent in the Laigh o' Moray but has suffered considerable weathering in places. The western face has a carved Celtic cross with elaborately interlaced decoration and a poorly preserved figural scene (perhaps a royal inauguration) set in a panel below the cross. The east face has four panels that show a large battle scene. The top panel is quite weathered and shows rows of horsemen. The second panel depicts armed foot soldiers and the third panel shows the decapitated vanquished soldiers, the heads piled up, and soldiers, archers and horsemen surrounding what may be a broch. The base panel depicts the victorious army leaving the battlefield. The sides are also elaborately carved. In the early 1990s the stone was encased in armoured glass to prevent further erosion and also graffiti. Interpretations 1861 drawing of the stone Side panel with sinuous vine patterns Radiocarbon dating at the site produced dates of charcoal fragments to between AD 600 and AD 1000. Two separate but similar patterns were discerned and may relate to the second stone. There is general agreement that the stone dates to between the 9th and 10th centuriesOram, Richard: Moray & Badenoch, A Historical Guide, Edinburgh, 1996, p. 65 and greater accuracy is probably not possible. The examination of the carvings has been carried out to compare the styleHenderson, I 'Pictish Vine-Scroll Ornament', in O'Connor, 1983 and also to interpret the figurativeJackson, 1983; 1993 and historical significance.Sellar, W D H 1993 'Sueno's Stone and its Interpreters', in Sellar, W D H (ed) Moray: Province and People, Scot Soc Northern Studies, 97‚Äì116. The Irish crosses of the 10th century are similar with their interweaving patterns and crowded panels of figures.Stevenson, R B K 1955 'Pictish Art', in Wainwright, F T (ed) The problem of the Picts, Edinburgh & London, 97‚Äì128 One hypothesis is that the figures depicted in the battle, parade and decapitation scenes is the army of Kenneth MacAlpin (Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n), the scene being the representation of Kenneth's demonstration of his military and legal authority over northern Pictland.Jackson, A 1993 'Further thoughts on Sueno's Stone'. The two side panels have sinuous vine patterns populated with men as depicted in the Book of Kells.Henderson, I 1983 'Pictish Vine-Scroll Ornament', in O'Connor, A & Clark, D V (eds), From the Stone Age to the 'Forty-Five, Edinburgh, 243-68. This suggests a date of between AD 800 and AD 900. The traditional interpretation of the battle scene was that it shows a victory by Malcolm II (M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda) (reigned 1005‚Äì1034) against Danes or Norse led by one Sueno. This appears in Alexander Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale of 1726 and is thought to have been ancient then, derived from folklore and the more learned histories of John of Fordun, Hector Boece and George Buchanan. However, this interpretation is no longer supported by historians and archaeologists. Several more recent interpretations have been advanced. Anthony Jackson suggested that the stone displayed the final triumph of the Christian Gaels of D√°l Riata over their, supposedly , Pictish enemies, in which case it would have been erected by Kenneth MacAlpin or his immediate successors. As an alternative, Archie Duncan advances his theory that the stone records the defeat, death and reburial of Dub (Dub mac Ma√≠l Coluim) in 966 or 967. A modified form of Jackson's theory, stripped of much of the ingenious interpretation, is probably the present orthodoxy. This holds that Sueno's Stone commemorates an unknown victory by the men of Alba, the Gaelicised Picts of the lands south of the Mounth over the men of Moray, those of the lands north of the Mounth. Legend Local legend says this was the crossroads where Macbeth originally met the three witches. In the legend, they were eventually imprisoned inside the stone and should the stone be broken they would be released. However this tale can date no further back than Shakespeare's play. Another legend suggests that the stone was erected for King Dub mac Ma√≠l Coluim. The Annals of Ulster reported \\"Dub mac Ma√≠l Coluim, king of Alba, was killed by the Scots themselves\\"; the usual way of reporting a death in internal strife, and place the death in 967. It has been suggested that Sueno's Stone, near Forres, may be a monument to Dub, erected by his brother Kenneth II (Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Coluim). It is presumed that Dub was killed or driven out by Cuil√©n, who became king after Dub's death, or by his supporters.

Details Riverford Farm was taken over by the Watson family in the 1950s and followed the normal pattern for British farms until the mid-1980s, when Guy Singh- Watson (then Guy Watson) decided to convert to organic farming. By the late 1980s this had been achieved. Singh-Watson aimed to find an effective way of distributing his produce. His idea was the weekly vegetable box scheme, the box being delivered direct to customers' doors with locally grown produce. Riverford chooses varieties for flavour rather than appearance and delivers earthy vegetables, which improves storage and taste. Starting from a weekly delivery of around 30 boxes to family and friends, in 2018 Riverford delivers around 45,000 boxes per week to households nationwide, sending its own meat and vegetables as well as organic fruit, dairy, wine, store cupboard staples and more. To achieve this they have formed a mutual cooperative of British farmers - not all in Devon. The weekly boxes come with a newsletter explaining the content of the box, giving farm news from Riverford and providing appropriate recipes. History In March 2005, before celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's school dinner project, Riverford obtained the catering contract for lunches at a local primary school. On 2 December 2007 Riverford appeared at number 92 in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100, a list of the 100 fastest growing companies in the UK.

Set in 1780, it is the sequel to These Old Shades (1926). The book was published in 1932, and has not been out of print since. It is one of Heyer's most popular novels. Plot summary The son of the Duke and Duchess of Avon, the Marquis of Vidal is known as Devil's Cub not only for the excesses of his father but for his own wild habits. As he is paying court to a girl of the bourgeoisie, Sophia Challoner, he also participates in a rather impromptu duel, the outcome of which forces him to leave the country. He intends to bring Sophia with him as his mistress: but her strait-laced sister Mary has no intention of allowing her sister to be ruined, and takes her place, assuming that the Marquis will let her go once the mistake is discovered, leaving him with no chance to take Sophia afterwards. But she has not yet obtained the measure of the Marquis's personality, for in the grip of fury he takes Mary off with him instead, and only when they are in France and it is too late for either to turn back does he realise that by abducting a respectable girl he has compromised her and is obliged to offer her marriage. However, Mary refuses Vidal because she believes he is making the offer from guilt and as she has fallen in love with him she finds this intolerable. In her misery, she runs away, intending to seek her own fortune. While away, she meets Vidal's father, the Duke of Avon, by chance, and takes him into her confidence without realising that she is talking to Avon - who is an old crony of her grandfather's and has come to France to investigate the rumours surrounding his son and scotch any scandal. The two reach an excellent understanding, with Avon clearly coming to respect Mary. Vidal pursues, and ultimately realizes he loves her, persuading her to marry him ‚Äî in spite of Avon's dry observation that she could do better. Heyer's An Infamous Army is a sequel to Devil's Cub.

Mills Joseph Wiltsie Fuller Potter Jr. (April 24, 1910Art Link - 1990) was an American Abstract expressionist artist. He was born in New York City in 1910, attended St. Bernard's School in New York and Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts, and lived most of his life in his Ledyard, Connecticut estate, near Old Mystic. Potter started painting in the traditional modes of representation, specializing in still life and landscape. His work was shown in New York in the 1930s at the Marie Harriman Gallery.Inside NYTimes.com, May 19, 1990 Potter spent several of his formative years painting landscapes and portraits in the Southern Appalachia region, later studying painting in Paris with Andr√© Lhote from 1929 to 1931, and in New York with Walt Kuhn and with Thomas Hart Benton. In 1950, Potter met Jackson Pollock and changed his mode of painting permanently to abstraction, and had a number of shows of that body of work at the Mystic Gallery in Mystic, Connecticut. When starting his transition towards abstract painting, he combined his graphic skills with his mastery of color, and followed a path that would lead to his artistic peak, during his full abstract expressionist period. During the 1940s, Potter's work was still mostly figurative, but showed deliberate avoidance of ordinary representation. From the early 1950s on, Potter's style kept with the early works of Ad Reinhardt and with Jackson Pollock's 1940s pre-drip works. He painted in the \\"New York School\\" style, along with several of his contemporaries, including Franz Kline (1910‚Äì1962), Joan Mitchell (1925‚Äì1992), Jean-Paul Riopelle, William Baziotes (1910‚Äì1963), and Jackson Pollock (1912‚Äì1956). He had a few shows in that style at several New England art venues. The Museum of the City of New York exhibited Potter's work along with Joan Mir√≥ and Georgia O'Keeffe in the main lobby in 1959. Jeffrey Potter's To a Violent Grave, a biography of Jackson Pollock's last years, reports that Potter shared drinking sessions with Pollock in the mid-1950s. After these encounters, which occupied only a short period of his life, Fuller Potter's work evolved towards a mature and personal form of abstraction. Potter never pursued the drip/throw action mode of abstract expressionism to any notable degree. His paint is delivered with loaded brush in hand, opulently, generously and aggressively. Fuller Potter is considered one of the major abstract painters of the 20th century. He died of emphysema in May 1990 at Westerly Hospital in Westerly, Rhode Island. He was 80 years old.

Beau Nash (18 October 1674 ‚Äì 3 February 1761), born Richard Nash, was a celebrated dandy and leader of fashion in 18th-century Britain. He is best remembered as the Master of Ceremonies at the spa town of Bath.  Biography  Nash was born in Goat Street, Swansea in 1674. He attended Jesus College, Oxford, served as an army officer, and was then called to the bar as a barrister, but made little of either career. In 1704, he became Master of Ceremonies at the rising spa town of Bath, a position he retained until he died. He lived in a house on Saw Close (now at the main entrance to the Theatre Royal), and kept a string of mistresses. He played a leading role in making Bath the most fashionable resort in 18th-century England. His position was unofficial, but nevertheless he had extensive influence in the city until early 1761. He would meet new arrivals to Bath and judge whether they were suitable to join the select \\"Company' of 500 to 600 people who had pre-booked tables, match ladies with appropriate dancing partners at each ball, pay the musicians at such events, broker marriages, escort unaccompanied wives and regulate gambling (by restraining compulsive gamblers or warning players against risky games or cardsharps). He was notable for encouraging a new informality in manners, breaking down the rigid barriers which had previously divided the nobility from the middle-class patrons of Bath, and even from the gentry. The Corporation of the city funded an elaborate funeral for Nash, and he was buried in the nave of Bath Abbey, not far from where a memorial was raised to him in 1790.notice of his funeral, Oxford Journal 21 Feb 1761, Burial notice, Bath Abbey parish registers 1761, position of grave from Guide to Bath 1813, and Notes for visitors to Bath Abbey by George Ford, 1982 Nash was a notorious gambler who was forced to move in with his mistress, Juliana Popjoy, due to his debts. Upon their separation, Popjoy was so distraught that she spent the majority of her remaining days living in a large hollowed-out tree. Shortly before her death, she moved out of the tree and back to her birth home, where she died. His death caused quite a stir at the time, with the celebrated author Oliver Goldsmith being moved to write The Life of Richard Nash as early as 1762. Nash and Wesley In his journal and letters, John Wesley, preacher and founder of Methodism, tells of a confrontation with Nash in Bath in 1739. Wesley's journey to Bath had been expected for some time, and Nash had made public his determination to confront him. Wesley proceeded to Bath, even though some people, afraid of the outcome, tried to talk him out of it. When Wesley began his preaching, there was \\"a much larger audience, among whom were many of the rich and great.\\" Facing Wesley, Nash questioned his authority, comparing the gathering to a conventicle, which was banned by Act of Parliament. Wesley answered that he had the authority of Jesus Christ and the Archbishop of Canterbury and that the gathering was not seditious and therefore did not contravene the Act. Nash complained that Wesley was scaring people out of their wits, but then admitted that he had never actually heard Wesley preach and was just relying on \\"common report\\". Wesley rejected this argument, stating that he did not judge Nash \\"by common report... it is not enough to judge by.\\" When Nash asked why people were coming to the meeting at all, an old woman in the crowd asked Wesley to allow her to answer. She then told Nash that, while he took care of his body, she and others were present in order to take care of their souls. Nash left.Journal of John Wesley at the Christian Classics Ethereal Library website Wesley wrote that, after his departure, \\"We immediately began praying for him, and then for all the despisers. As we returned, they hollowed and hissed us along the streets; but when any of them asked, 'Which is he' and I answered, 'I am he,' they were immediately silent.\\"The Letters of John Wesley, 1739, at the Wesley Center Online  Beau Nash and Tunbridge Wells  Beau Nash young (illustration, 1886) In 1735, Nash appointed himself Master of Ceremonies in Tunbridge Wells and retained control of the entertainments provided for visitors until his death in 1761. Bath, it was said, was his kingdom, and Tunbridge Wells a colony of that kingdom. Nash had been interested in taking control at Tunbridge Wells for some years, but had been excluded by the formidable Bell Causey, who \\"presided as absolute governess\\" until her death in 1734. As well as organizing entertainments, Nash established strict rules for correct behaviour. In order to ensure that visitors paid subscriptions for services provided, he introduced Sarah Porter, \\"Queen of the Touters\\", who eagerly pursued defaulters. Under Nash, Tunbridge Wells attained the height of its fame as a fashionable resort, patronised by royalty, nobility, and the most famous names in the country. It is notable that there is a pub in Tunbridge Wells named after Beau Nash himself, whilst The Ragged Trousers exhibits a plaque on the exterior of the building in Nash's honour. Later use of name A cinema was erected in Westgate Street in Bath in 1920 and named the Beau Nash Picture House in memory of Nash. The building, now Grade II listed, is currently known as the Komedia. In popular culture In 1999, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-part comedy series entitled King of Bath, written by Arnold Evans and starring David Bamber as Nash, detailing fictitious adventures and mis-adventures of Nash while in Bath. The series has since been re-broadcast on BBC Radio 7 and BBC Radio 4 Extra. Nash's life and death are major plot elements in the 2017 detective novel Beau Death by Peter Lovesey. The book includes a fictitious Beau Nash Society consisting of prominent citizens of Bath.

CISPES supports the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front and the progressive social movement in El Salvador. CISPES was founded in 1980 in opposition to the U.S. aid (funding and political support) to the Salvadoran military and government during the Salvadoran civil war. CISPES opposed the politics and the actions of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and its leader Roberto D'Aubuisson during the Salvadoran Civil War, and continues to oppose the policies that ARENA implements. Since the end of El Salvador's civil war in 1992, CISPES has worked with the FMLN and with Salvadoran popular movement organizations (unions, women's groups, peasants groups, etc.) in opposition to economic policies of free trade and privatization such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). CISPES organizes delegations to visit with El Salvador's left wing activists as well as organizing delegations to monitor Salvadoran elections for potential fraud or political manipulation.  FBI investigations  Responsible for the distribution and dissemination of a Soviet forged State Department paper Dissent Paper on El Salvador and Central AmericaRichard H. Shultz. The Soviet Union and Revolutionary Warfare: Principles, Practices, and Regional Comparisons, Hoover Press, 1988 CISPES was a target of two FBI investigations during the 1980s. From August to December 1981 the FBI conducted a 3-month inquiry (something less than an investigation) into whether CISPES was merely a front organization for the Salvadoran rebel groups, thereby placing the organization in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The organization that had grown to over 300 regional chapters in one year, came under DOJ and FBI scrutiny based on the alleged travel diary of Farid Handal, brother of Salvadoran Communist Party leader Schafik H√°ndal, that supposedly had been seized by the Salvadoran National Guard during raids on rebel safehouses and handed over the CIA. A story about the diary made its way into a John Birch Society publication Review of the News and a Republican House of Representative staffer passed a copy on to the FBI.[14]The diary was said to outline Farid's visit to the US and his meetings with Sandy Pollack, representing both the U.S. Peace Council (USPC, the national chapter of the then Soviet directed World Peace Council) and the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), and with others, with the expressed and sole purpose of creating a solidarity network in the US for the Salvadoran rebels.[15] Only a few months after Handal's trip in May 1980, during which he did meet with Pollack, according to her biography published by the US Peace Council,US Peace Council (1985)Sandy Pollack Her Life New York, NY. pp 8.(ASIN: B000F3JRBK) CISPES came into being by way of two founding conferences in which various Salvadoran rebels participated. Members in the Los Angeles chapter, for example, claimed that they had been informally working together for a year before the founding conference in October.[16] Pollack was a founding member of the CISPES national council and served as such until her death in 1985. But, in the end, the FBI could not authenticate the diary and found no other verifiable evidence to prove direct control of CISPES by a foreign entity or to warrant further investigation. The case was dropped pending any further developments. By March 1983, the FBI had received what it considered to be sufficient information to open a full investigation into whether CISPES was providing financial and other types of aid in support of FMLN and FDR terrorist activities. The initial scope of the investigation was focused on CISPES leadership and especially its DC headquarters and Dallas chapter. But in late 1983 a directive was sent to all FBI field offices initiating a nationwide investigation that engulfed all members of 180 CISPES chapters as well as nearly 200 other groups that had the slightest connection to CISPES. The new investigation hinged mostly on information supplied by an informant, Frank Varelli, who the FBI later admitted had not been properly vetted and should never have been taken seriously. The investigation was closed in 1985. Later inquiries into the mishandling of the investigation by Congress led to disciplinary action against 6 FBI personnel, the resignation of the FBI officer responsible for handling Varelli [22], and many FBI policy and procedural changes.

Ollier, London. The Cenci, A Tragedy, in Five Acts (1819) is a verse drama in five acts by Percy Bysshe Shelley written in the summer of 1819, and inspired by a real Italian family, the House of Cenci (in particular, Beatrice Cenci, pronounced CHEN-chee). Shelley composed the play in Rome and at Villa Valsovano near Livorno, from May to August 5, 1819. The work was published by Charles and James Ollier in London in 1819. The Livorno edition was printed in Livorno, Italy by Shelley himself in a run of 250 copies. Shelley told Thomas Love Peacock that he arranged for the printing himself because in Italy \\"it costs, with all duties and freightage, about half of what it would cost in London.\\" Shelley sought to have the play staged, describing it as \\"totally different from anything you might conjecture that I should write; of a more popular kind... written for the multitude.\\" Shelley wrote to his publisher Charles Ollier that he was confident that the play \\"will succeed as a publication.\\" A second edition appeared in 1821, his only published work to go into a second edition during his lifetime. The play was not considered stageable in its day due to its themes of incest and parricide, and was not performed in public in England until 1922, when it was staged in London. In 1886 the Shelley Society had sponsored a private production at the Grand Theatre, Islington, before an audience that included Oscar Wilde, Robert Browning, and George Bernard Shaw.Oscar Wilde's review of the performance in Dramatic Review (May 15, 1886) in \\"Reviews\\".Armstrong, James. \\"Premieres Unpleasant: How the Infamous Debut of Shelley's The Cenci Helped Make Shaw a Playwright.\\" Shaw, Vol. 37, No. 2 (2017), pp. 282-299.

Rosemont, 2005. It was included in the Harvard Classics as one of the most important and representative works of the Western canon. Plot The horrific tragedy, set in 1599 in Rome, of a young woman executed for pre-meditated murder of her tyrannical father, was a well-known true story handed down orally and documented in the Annali d'Italia, a twelve-volume chronicle of Italian history written by Ludovico Antonio Muratori in 1749. The events occurred during the Pontificate of Pope Clement VIII. Shelley was first drawn to dramatize the tale after viewing Guido Reni's portrait of Beatrice Cenci, a painting that intrigued Shelley's poetic imagination. Act I The play opens with Cardinal Camillo discussing with Count Francesco Cenci a murder in which Cenci is implicated. Camillo tells Cenci that the matter will be hushed up if Cenci will relinquish a third of his possessions, his property beyond the Pincian gate, to the Church. Count Cenci has sent two of his sons, Rocco and Cristofano, to Salamanca, Spain in the expectation that they will die of starvation. The Count's virtuous daughter, Beatrice, and Orsino, a prelate in love with Beatrice, discuss petitioning the Pope to relieve the Cenci family from the Count's brutal rule. Orsino withholds the petition, however, revealing himself to be disingenuous, lustful for Beatrice, and greedy. After he hears the news that his sons have been brutally killed in Salamanca, the Count holds a feast in celebration of their deaths, commanding his guests to revel with him. Cenci drinks wine which he imagines as \\"my children's blood\\" which he \\"did thirst to drink!\\" During the feast, Beatrice pleads with the guests to protect her family from her sadistic father, but the guests refuse, in fear of Cenci's brutality and retribution. Act II Count Cenci torments Beatrice and her stepmother, Lucretia, and announces his plan to imprison them in his castle in Petrella. A servant returns Beatrice's petition to the Pope, unopened, and Beatrice and Lucretia despair over the last hope of salvation from the Count. Orsino encourages Cenci's son, Giacomo, upset over Cenci's appropriation of Giacomo's wife's dowry, to murder Cenci. Act III Beatrice reveals to Lucretia that the Count has committed an unnameable act against her and expresses feelings of spiritual and physical contamination, implying Cenci's incestuous rape of his daughter. Orsino and Lucretia agree with Beatrice's suggestion that the Count must be murdered. After the first attempt at patricide fails because Cenci arrives early, Orsino conspires with Beatrice, Lucretia, and Giacomo, in a second assassination plot. Orsino proposes that two of Cenci's ill-treated servants, Marzio and Olimpio, carry out the murder. Act IV The scene shifts to the Petrella Castle in the Apulian Apennines. Olimpio and Marzio enter Cenci's bedchamber to murder him, but hesitate to kill the sleeping Count and return to the conspirators with the deed undone. Threatening to kill Cenci herself, Beatrice shames the servants into action, and Olimpio and Marzio strangle the Count and throw his body out of the room off the balcony, where it is entangled in a pine. Shortly thereafter, Savella, a papal legate, arrives with a murder charge and execution order against Cenci. Upon finding the Count's dead body, the legate arrests the conspirators, with the exception of Orsino, who escapes in disguise. Act V The suspects are taken for trial for murder in Rome. Marzio is tortured and confesses to the murder, implicating Cenci's family members. Despite learning that Lucretia and Giacomo have also confessed, Beatrice refuses to do so, steadfastly insisting on her innocence. At the trial, all of the conspirators are found guilty and sentenced to death. Bernardo, another of Cenci's sons, attempts a futile last-minute appeal to the Pope to have mercy on his family. The Pope is reported to have declared: \\"They must die.\\" The play concludes with Beatrice walking stoically to her execution for murder. Her final words are: \\"We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.\\" Major characters * Count Francesco Cenci, head of the Cenci household and family * Beatrice, his daughter * Lucretia, the wife of Francesco Cenci and the stepmother of his children * Cardinal Camillo * Orsino, a Prelate * Savella, the Pope's Legate * Andrea, a servant to Francesco Cenci * Marzio, an assassin * Olimpio, an assassin * Giacomo, son of Francesco Cenci * Bernardo, son of Francesco Cenci Performance History= England  The play was first staged in England by the Shelley Society in 1886. It did not receive its first public performance in England until 1922.  France  The play's second production was in France was in 1891, directed by Lugn√®-Poe at the Theatre d'Art.:1097 = Antonin Artaud adaptation = Antonin Artaud staged his adaptation Les Censi in 1935 at the Theatre Folies-Wagram.:1099 The production was shown only 17 times before closing due to poor reviews.:132 Artaud staged the production in line with his theory for a Theatre of Cruelty,. and he 'exaggerated the sadistic and pathological elements of the play to a point of violence'.:1099 He used highly graphic and disturbing images that were meant to release the audience from their current state of mind, especially during the murder scene, where the main character, Count Cenci (the role that was played by Artaud), is murdered by his two servants. These images were supposed to release what Artaud called the \\"savage under the skin\\", an aim that was used by Artaud in many of his productions. Critical reception In his May 15, 1886 review of the play, Oscar Wilde concluded: \\"In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.\\" Alfred and H. Buxton Forman also praised The Cenci as a \\"tragic masterpiece\\", elevating Shelley into the company of Sophocles, Euripides, and Shakespeare. Leigh Hunt, to whom the play was dedicated, effused over Shelley's \\"great sweetness of nature, and enthusiasm for good\\". Mary Shelley, in her note on the play, wrote that \\"[u]niversal approbation soon stamped The Cenci as the best tragedy of modern times.\\" She critically assessed Act V: \\"The Fifth Act is a masterpiece. It is the finest thing he ever wrote, and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary, but preceding, poet.\\" She noted that \\"Shelley wished The Cenci to be acted\\", intending the work, which she wrote was of \\"surpassing excellence\\", to be an acting play, not a \\"closet drama\\". Shelley sought unsuccessfully to have the play staged at Covent Garden. Byron wrote his criticisms of the play in a letter to Shelley: \\"I read Cenci ‚Äì but, besides that I think the subject essentially un-dramatic, I am not a great admirer of our old dramatists as models. I deny that the English have hitherto had a drama at all. Your Cenci, however, was a work of power and poetry.\\" Byron told Thomas Medwin in conversation: \\"The Cenci is... perhaps the best tragedy modern times have produced.\\" William Wordsworth reportedly called the play \\"the greatest tragedy of the age.\\"Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137. After seeing a performance of the play in 1886, George Bernard Shaw commented that \\"Shelley and Shakespeare are the only dramatists who have dealt in despair of this quality.\\"Bieri, James. 2005 p. 137. A reviewer writing for the Literary Gazette in 1820, on the other hand, wrote that the play was \\"noxious\\", \\"odious\\", and \\"abominable\\". The taboo subjects of incest, patricide, and parricide, as well as the negative depiction of the Roman Catholic Church, however, prevented The Cenci from being staged publicly. Opera adaptations German composer Berthold Goldschmidt composed an opera in three acts based on the Shelley play in 1949 entitled Beatrice Cenci with a libretto by Martin Esslin \\"after Shelley's verse drama The Cenci\\". The opera won first prize in the Festival of Britain opera competition in 1951. The opera was first performed in 1988. The first staged production of Beatrice Cenci in the UK was by the Trinity College of Music on July 9‚Äì11, 1998. In 1951, British classical composer Havergal Brian composed an opera based on the Shelley play entitled The Cenci, an opera in eight scenes. The opera premiered in 1997 in the UK in a performance in London by the Millennium Sinfonia conducted by James Kelleher.. In 1971, Beatrix Cenci premiered, an opera in two acts by Alberto Ginastera to a Spanish libretto by the playwright William Shand. Other works titled The Cenci Other works titled The Cenci include an 1837 novella by Marie-Henri Beyle (Stendhal), and an 1840 true crime essay by Alexandre Dumas p√®re included in Volume 1 of Celebrated Crimes.

It has nothing to do with the contents of any book, and should not be confused with Library of Congress Classification. History The LCCN numbering system has been in use since 1898, at which time the acronym LCCN originally stood for Library of Congress Card Number. It has also been called the Library of Congress Catalog Card Number, among other names. The Library of Congress prepared cards of bibliographic information for their library catalog and would sell duplicate sets of the cards to other libraries for use in their catalogs. This is known as centralized cataloging. Each set of cards was given a serial number to help identify it. Although most of the bibliographic information is now electronically created, stored, and shared with other libraries, there is still a need to identify each unique record, and the LCCN continues to perform that function. Librarians all over the world use this unique identifier in the process of cataloging most books which have been published in the United States. It helps them reach the correct cataloging data (known as a cataloging record), which the Library of Congress and third parties make available on the Web and through other media. In February 2008, the Library of Congress created the LCCN Permalink service, providing a stable URL for all Library of Congress Control Numbers. Format In its most elementary form, the number includes a year and a serial number. The year has two digits for 1898 to 2000, and four digits beginning in 2001. The three ambiguous years (1898, 1899, and 1900) are distinguished by the size of the serial number. There are also some peculiarities in numbers beginning with a \\"7\\" because of an experiment applied between 1969 and 1972 which added a check digit. Serial numbers are six digits long and should include leading zeros. The leading zeros padding the number are a more recent addition to the format, so many older works will show less-full codes. The hyphen that is often seen separating the year and serial number is optional. More recently, the Library of Congress has instructed publishers not to include a hyphen.

Lawrence is best known for his comic strips The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire in the British weeklies Ranger and Look and Learn and the Storm series, first published in the Dutch weekly Eppo (later relaunched as Sjors & Sjimmie) and subsequently in album form. Famous for his realistic and detailed style, he was an inspiration for later UK comic-book artists such as Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons and Chris WestonDon Lawrence, 75, Science Fiction Illustrator (indeed, Weston was taught by Lawrence), and influenced Indonesian artist Apri Kusbiantoro.Apri Kusbiantoro: Indonesian successor of Don Lawrence Early life Born in East Sheen, a suburb of London, Lawrence was educated at St. Paul's School, Hammersmith. After joining the Army for his National Service, Lawrence used his gratuity to study art at Borough Polytechnic Institute (now the London South Bank University) but failed his final exams. Shortly before, a former student had visited the school to show students the work he was doing as a letterer on comic strips. Lawrence was inspired to take some samples to an editor at Amalgamated Press who suggested he try showing them to Mick Anglo, who ran a studio packaging comic strips for a London publisher and magazine distributor, Len Miller. Career Lawrence worked for Anglo for four years, drawing the adventures of superhero Marvelman and various Western comic strips. After an argument with Anglo over pay rates, he found work with Odhams Press, drawing Wells Fargo for Zip, and with the Amalgamated Press (now renamed Fleetway Publications), contributing episodes of Billy the Kid to the comic Sun. When the ailing Sun merged with Lion, Lawrence switched to swashbuckling historical strips, Olac the Gladiator, Karl the Viking and Maroc the Mighty (written by Michael Moorcock).Obituary: Don Lawrence  Global  The Guardian A colour strip produced for Lion Annual 1965 ('Karl the Viking and the Tideless Sea') led to Lawrence being offered colour work in Bible Story magazine and the sprawling science fantasy The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire which debuted in Ranger in 1965. Lawrence was to draw the strip in the pages of Ranger and Look and Learn until 1976. In 1976 Lawrence attended the London comic book convention called Comics 101, the first convention dedicated to British comic book creators. There he learned that The Trigan Empire was syndicated all over Europe. When his publisher refused to give him any form of royalties or compensation, he departed from his old employer and was immediately offered work on a new Dutch comic magazine called Eppo.British Artist Don Lawrence Dies at 75 After an abortive start on a strip entitled Commander Grek written by his friend Vince Wernham, Lawrence found success with Storm. The first volume, The Deep World, was based on a concept by Martin Lodewijk but written by Philip Dunn. A further 22 volumes followed. Lawrence did not limit himself solely to Trigan Empire and Storm; other strips he drew include Fireball XL5 and The Adventures of Tarzan for TV Century 21, Carrie for the men's magazine Mayfair and a number of one-off strips for various Dutch publishers. A number of partly completed and unpublished comic strips appeared in the series Don Lawrence Collection, published in the Netherlands. The final Storm serial (completed by Lawrence's former assistant Liam Sharp) appeared in the magazine Pandarve published by the Don Lawrence Fanclub in 1999‚Äì2001. One of his last illustrations was the cover of volume 6 of the Storm -the collection- from 2002. In the mid 1980s he was looking for an assistant and accepted then 17-years old Liam Sharp as his apprentice, but after realizing he did not want to step back as much as he had thought he would, he helped Sharp develop his own style.British comic-book artist Liam Sharp on his career, DC or Marvel, and advice for his younger self Later life In 1995, he lost sight of his right eye, caused by an infection after an unsuccessful cataract operation. With his depth perception gone, he could no longer see when the tip of his pen and brush touched the paper's surface, forcing him to teach himself an alternative drawing technique.The World of Don Lawrence ‚Äì Just 75 He went through a new cataract operation in 1999, this time without medical complications. But his general health was starting to decline, and when he was diagnosed with emphysema and put on medication, he permanently retired from comics and art. Lawrence died in December 2003 of emphysema at the age of 75.

The electoral ward had a population of 2,570 at the 2011 census. The village has three churches: one Gospel Hall (Plymouth Brethren), one Methodist and one Anglican, St John The Baptist, with a fine Norman doorway that survived Victorian restoration. Among the tombstones are some who were victims of plague, and above the churchyard are the remains of a 14th-century sanctuary chapel built by John Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter to provide a refuge for felons who had accepted life banishment, as they travelled from Exeter to sail from Teignmouth. The village has four pubs: The Old Commercial, The Old Workshop, the Ring of Bells and the Cockhaven Arms. It also has a local brewery called Red Rock based behind the Old Workshop pub, the Old Walls Vineyard and Shute Fruit and Produce, a pick your own field. There is a small beach on the estuary, known locally as Down Steps, the River Beach or Red Rock. It is reached via a footpath from the village that crosses the main Teignmouth to Newton Abbot road and the railway, and goes down the steep Luxton Steps. This ancient footpath leads to the point where villagers could ford the river at low tide to reach Coombe Cellars. Half a mile away is the Bishop's Palace, now a ruin (hence the local name of the Old Walls), built in the 13th century by Walter de Bronescombe, and expanded later by Grandisson. It is an example of a small and compact bishop's palace and the remains include an inner and outer court plus substantial buried remains.

It was formed in 1983 and was operated as a partnership between LIN Broadcasting Corp., Mobile Communication Corp. of America and BellSouth Co. Its headquarters were located in Houston, Texas.\\" Join A Winning Team.\\" Houston Cellular. April 20, 1999. Retrieved on April 24, 2010. \\"Houston Cellular, 1001 West Loop South\\" Through a series of acquisitions and mergers, within 10 years, the company consisted of a two-way partnership between BellSouth and AT&T; Wireless. This partnership was also known as BellSouth Mobility, LLC. Houston Cellular began providing service in May 1986. History Houston Cellular was formed as a result of the October 1983 Federal Communications Commission's ruling that set aside sufficient frequencies for the operation of two cellular systems in each metropolitan area. In the early 1990s, this ruling was expanded with the advent of the 800 and 1900 MHz protocols, which are also known as PCS). The ruling reserved one system for application by local phone companies. In Houston, the competing non-local company service was applied by GTE Mobilnet. In June 2000, the above-mentioned FCC ruling was repealed and GTE merged with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon Wireless. At that time, AT&T; Wireless sold its 55% stake in Houston Cellular to BellSouth. AT&T; Wireless then bought 20 MHz of the CDMA spectrum owned by the outgoing PrimeCo (which was swallowed in the formation of Verizon Wireless). This purchase of frequencies was used to directly compete in the Houston market with D-AMPS (TDMA) service. Additionally, Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, a division of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, was also partnered with GTE, a partnership which that was later dissolved. In 2001, BellSouth partnered with Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems. This partnership renamed the division from BellSouth Mobility, LLC to Cingular Wireless, LLC. It also transformed Houston Cellular into Cingular Wireless. Recent Development In 2006, the parent company of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, AT&T; Inc., acquired BellSouth. Eventually, this led to the renaming of Cingular Wireless, LLC to AT&T; Mobility, LLC. The service is now branded as \\"Wireless from AT&T;, formerly Cingular Wireless\\", \\"Wireless from AT&T;\\" or sometimes simply \\"AT&T;\\".

He was also the 50th Raja of the Chakma tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of present-day Bangladesh from 2 May 1953, until his abdication in 1971 following the Bangladesh Liberation War.Hindus Contribution Towards Making Of Pakistan Retrieved 28 January 2011 He chose to remain a Pakistani when Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971. He became known as a writer, diplomat, Buddhist religious leader and politician in Pakistan. Between 1981 and 1995, he served as Ambassador of Pakistan to Argentina with concurrent accreditation in Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Ecuador. He was also a Minister-For-Life within the Pakistani government. Tridev Roy died in September 2012. Biography Roy was born in 1933 in Rajbari, Rangamati, Chittagong Hill Tracts, British India. He was the son of Raja Nalinaksha Roy. His mother Benita Roy was the grand daughter of Keshab Chandra Sen, a leading nineteenth century Brahmo Samaj leader and reformer of Bengal. Leading actress and danseuse Sadhana Bose and classical singer Naina Devi were his maternal aunts. He was installed as the 50th Raja, or hereditary King of the Chakma Circle, on 2 May 1953. Roy abdicated the throne 1971 in favour of his son, Raja Devasish Roy, the current ruler of the Chakma people, during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Roy remained a practicing Buddhist, the predominant faith of the Chakma people, throughout his life. Despite being heavily non-Muslim, the Chittagong Hill Tracts were awarded to Pakistan (specifically East Pakistan) by the British during the 1947 partition of India. The Chakmas and other people of the hill tracts had favored union with India instead of Pakistan. Initially granted special autonomy, the status of the region was changed by the Pakistani government during the 1950s to allow the settlement of large numbers of largely non- indigenous, Muslim Bengali settlers into the region. The Pakistani government also opened a hydro-electric dam, the Kaptai Dam in the early 1960s, which flooded about 40% of the Chakmas' available arable land. However, the Chakmas under Tridev Roy chose to remain neutral during the 1960s and 1970s as relations between the Pakistani Army and Mukti Bahini, which fought for Bangladeshi independence. In 1970, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the head of the Awami League and future founder of Bangladesh, asked Roy to run for Parliament as a member of the Awami League. Roy declined Rahman's offering, choosing instead to run in the 1970 general election as an independent. Roy won his election as independent candidate from his constituency in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Roy sided with Pakistan in 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in Bangladesh's independence. Following the war and Bangladesh's independence, Roy chose to move from the former East Pakistan to West Pakistan, where he resided for the rest of his life. Roy feared political persecution if he remained in Bangladesh after the country's independence, which led to his decision to move to Pakistan. He also felt that the new Bangladeshi government would no longer guarantee the special autonomous status of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. He abdicated as the Raja of the Chakmas in 1971 in favor of his son, Raja Debashish Roy, when he went into exile. The government of Pakistan made Roy a lifetime federal minister for his loyalty to the government in Islamabad during the war. Roy headed a delegation from Pakistan to oppose Bangladesh's application to join the United Nations. The government of Bangladesh, under Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, sent its own delegation to New York to apply for admission led by Tridev Roy's mother Rajmata Benita Roy. Roy joined the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto during the 1970s. Bhutto offered Roy the position of President of Pakistan once he became Prime Minister of Pakistan. However, Roy declined Bhutto's offer of the presidency because, under the new Constitution of Pakistan of 1973, only Muslims can become President of Pakistan. Roy, who called the presidency a \\"gilded cage,\\" was unwilling to convert from Buddhism to Islam to hold the office. Bhutto was later overthrown by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977. In 1981, Roy was appointed as Pakistani Ambassador to Argentina by the Zia government, a move which simultaneously removed him from day-to-day involvement in Pakistani politics. He was simultaneously accredited as an ambassador in Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay and he held these positions until 1995. He later was Pakistan's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. He remained abroad to abroad until 1996, when he returned to Islamabad. Roy also held the position as a federal minister-for-life within the Pakistani government. Roy, a leading figure in Pakistan's Buddhist community, headed the Pakistan Buddhist Society from 1996 until his death in 2012. In 2005, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, General Srilal Weerasooriya, on behalf of the President, conferred the emblems of the Sri Lanka Ranjana Award on Federal Minister Tridev Roy for his work on behalf of Pakistan's Buddhist community. Tridiv Roy died from cardiac arrest at his home in Islamabad on 17 September 2012, at the age of 79. He is survived by his wife, Arati Roy, three sons, and two daughters.

His sole UK chart-topper, \\"Only Sixteen\\" (1959), sold more copies in the UK than Sam Cooke's original version. Career Born a twin, in Newport, Isle of Wight the former Terence Perkins was employed as a milkman before becoming a professional singer, and was known to many as the 'Singing Milkman'. His manager was Bunny Lewis, who gave him the name Craig Douglas. Lewis saw the name outside a house in Scotland. Douglas said there were a number of Terrys around at the time and not many Craigs, and that was one of the reasons his name was changed. Voted 'Best New Singer' in 1959 in the British music magazine, NME, Douglas went on to record eight cover versions of former American hit songs, in his total of nine Top 40 UK singles. Amongst that tally, Douglas had a Number One single in 1959 with \\"Only Sixteen\\", which easily outsold Sam Cooke's original version in the UK. It was recorded at EMI's Abbey Road studios, with whistling by Mike Sammes, and released through Top Rank records. Douglas had four consecutive Number 9 placings on the UK Singles Chart. In 1961 Douglas entered the A Song For Europe contest with his song \\"The Girl Next Door\\", but did not do well. Douglas also starred in the 1962 film It's Trad, Dad! He topped the bill on the Beatles' first major stage show, although their emergence ultimately spelt the end of Douglas's chart career. His final chart entry came in February 1963, when \\"Town Crier\\" flopped at Number 36. He continues to perform, with bookings at night clubs and on cruise ships. Until 2010, Douglas toured venues across the UK, including the Medina Theatre on the Isle of Wight. He appeared at the Amersham Rock 'n' Roll Club on 11 December 2010, an event in his benefit. John Leyton, Mike Berry and the Flames all took part, while Jet Harris and other celebrities attended. Douglas sang three songs from his wheelchair at the close of the concert. He suffers from a rare condition that affects his legs. Sky News filmed the event. On 18 April 2011, a rare Douglas recording, saw a limited 7\\" vinyl reissue of \\"Don't Mind If I Cry\\", produced by Tony Hatch, on the UK-based Spoke Records label. This had previously been the B-side to Douglas' 1969 release, \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\\", a cover of the B.J. Thomas song.

On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Talloires-Montmin.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 23 November 2015 Due to its setting on Lake Annecy Talloires has become a popular resort town not only since it has been rediscovered by a privileged society of artists and writers but also since the start of the 20th century when the place became a world-renowned location.http://www.abbaye-talloires.com/hotel-annecy/hotel- tradition_en.aspx Geography Talloires is located south of Geneva, Switzerland, on Lake Annecy and south of the local \\"prefecture\\" Annecy, near the border of Italy. The town is situated in the French Alps, along a bay on the east side of the lake. History The area of Talloires has been settled since Neolithic times. In Roman times, Talloires was a stage on the consular road leading from Milan to Strasbourg; the town is however mentioned for the first time in the 9th century AD. In 1016 an abbey was founded here by King Rudolph III of Burgundy and monks from Savigny Abbey and Lyon. The now standing structures of the Abbey were built in 1681. The famous chemist Claude Louis Berthollet was born in Talloires, then part of the Duchy of Savoy, in 1749. Tourism Talloires' mountainous landscapes and picturesque setting on Lake Annecy, medieval architecture, character, and summer and winter sports and activities, have created a small tourist industry in the village. The summer activities in and around the Lake Annecy include sports (golf, water skiing, sailing, trekking in the surrounding Alps, tennis, canyoning, paragliding, horse back riding) and events (the annual F√™te du Lac and Pyro Concerts). The area has hosted stages of the Tour de France several times, including a time trial stage around the lake. Talloires is close to ski resorts Meg√®ve, Espace Diamant, and La Clusaz. The village of Talloires is away from Annecy, a city and major tourist destination. Annecy is three and a half hours from Paris on the TGV high-speed trains. Geneva International Airport is 50 minutes away on the A43 highway. The primary business of the town is tourism, although it is still a complete community in its own right, with a central church, post office, bank, library, and a small general store. Conferences and education Several international conferences have been conducted in Talloires, especially within the sustainable development and educational communities. The town was the birthplace of \\"The Talloires Declaration: University presidents for a Sustainable Future,\\"http://www.iisd.org/educate/declarat/talloire.htm an influential declaration on actions required by university leaders to reverse \\"environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources.\\" Several conferences of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University have been held in Talloires. Talloires was also the site of a September 2005 conference on university civic engagement. This conference of 29 university presidents produced the Talloires Declaration on the Civic Roles and Social Responsibilities of Higher Education, which calls upon the university to \\"use the processes of education and research to respond to, serve and strengthen its communities for local and global citizenship.\\" The declaration established the Talloires Network, an association of universities committed to advancing the principles of the declaration. As of July 2012, 247 universities have signed the declaration and have become members of the Talloires Network. Tufts University maintains its European Center in the local 11th-century (former) Benedictine priory. The priory serves as a conference center and campus for visiting college students.http://ase.tufts.edu/frenchalps/ Images Image:Talloires , view of Lake Annecy, Kodacolor by Scott Williams.jpgView of Lake Annecy from Talloires Image:TuftsEuropeanCenter.JPGThe Tufts European Center on the Talloires campus See also *Communes of the Haute-Savoie department ReferencesExternal links *Official site Category:Former communes of Haute-Savoie Category:Populated places disestablished in 2016 ","title":"Talloires"},{"id":"1491533","text":"Q5 may refer to: * Q (TV series), a Spike Milligan BBC series that was known during its first series as \\"Q5\\" * Q5 (band), an American heavy metal group * BlackBerry Q5 * Quran 5, the 5th chapter of the Islamic Holy book Transport * Audi Q5, a compact luxury crossover SUV * Q5 (New York City bus) * LNER Class Q5, a class of British 0-8-0 steam locomotive (previously known as NER Classes T & T1) Military * Nanchang Q-5 ground attack aircraft * HMS Farnborough, also known as Q5, was a Q-ship of the First World War * Q-5 is an alternate designation for the AQM-60 Kingfisher See also *5Q ","title":"Q5"},{"id":"1491535","text":"Byala Slatina () is a town-selo in Northwestern Bulgaria.

Between 1836 and 1844, the 21st rule of the U.S. House of Representatives (the so-called gag rule) provided that no petition relating to slavery would be entertained in any way; therefore, all such petitions and memorials received while this rule was in effect were tabled. The rule, proposed by South Carolina Representative Henry L. Pinckney, was passed without any debate. During this period, hundreds of petitions relating to the abolition of slavery, slavery in the District of Columbia, fugitive slave laws and fugitive slaves, the admission of slave states, slavery in the territories, African colonization, and repeal of the 21st rule were tabled. Before the rule was adopted In the 1830s, the American Anti-Slavery Society wanted to propose to Congress that it make an attempt toward abolishing slavery. As such, abolitionists across the country organized and eventually submitted over 130,000 petitions to the House of Representatives between 1831 and 1844. James Hammond, a representative from South Carolina, first proposed the idea of imposing a gag on all anti-slavery petitions. Future President James Polk, at that time a representative from Tennessee, tried to resolve this problem and put it in the hands of a special committee. The committee's chairman, Henry Pinckney, dealt with the matter by refusing to consider any of them, and making anything that involved slavery automatically tabled. In 1836, the 24th Congress adopted the well-known Gag Rule. This rule declared that all petitions regarding slavery must be approved before passed or ‚Äúbe laid on the table and that no further action whatever shall be laid thereon.‚Äù Opposition Many people disagreed with this rule. The Whigs were opposed; John Quincy Adams led a group of congressmen who wanted to get rid of the rule. Adams declared to everyone that he was not an abolitionist, but thought this rule violated the constitutional right to petition. The Gag Rule was going against the First Amendment, which gives everyone freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Adams wanted to pass an amendment To what? against the Gag Rule. When the Whigs took control of the house, the Underwoods of Kentucky proposed an amendment declaring that the old House rules prevailed, instead of getting rid of them after a certain number of days. This included the 21st rule. Adams was not so fond of the idea and proposed a whole new amendment against the Underwoods to get rid of the 21st Rule. It passed by eight votes, 112‚Äì104. People who opposed Adams' ideas tried to kick him out of the House. They tried to take the chairmanship of the Congressional Committee Position from him. The first time Congress attempted to do this, they were unsuccessful. Everyone who opposed him tried again and the same result occurred.  Adams' Plan  Adams kept on questioning Polk, and saying that the petitions sent out to create the Gag Rule could be alleged. When Polk failed to answer, Adams stated that everyone has the freedom of thought and action. Slavery should take a toll on one's patience, but if someone had a desire to question this act, it is covered by the law. In January 1844, Adams and his committee finally eliminated the Gag Rule. The House was not so content with this decision and had a long discussion about it. Many still supported the Gag Rule and wanted the question voted. The vote ended up being 86‚Äì116 to bring the rule back. The House was still not satisfied and wanted to hold another poll, to see if the public wanted to reconsider the first vote on getting the Gag Rule back. This proposal also failed, 56‚Äì116. At last, on December 3, 1844, Congress finally agreed to rescind the Gag Rule. Adams' campaign had worked.

The command is also available in the EFI shell.  Overview  The \`rm\` command removes references to objects from the filesystem using the unlink system call, where those objects might have had multiple references (for example, a file with two different names), and the objects themselves are discarded only when all references have been removed and no programs still have open handles to the objects. This allows for scenarios where a program can open a file, immediately remove it from the filesystem, and then use it for temporary space, knowing that the file's space will be reclaimed after the program exits, even if it exits by crashing. The command generally does not destroy file data, since its purpose is really merely to unlink references, and the filesystem space freed may still contain leftover data from the removed file. This can be a security concern in some cases, and hardened versions sometimes provide for wiping out the data as the last link is being cut, and programs such as shred and srm are available which specifically provide data wiping capability. \`rm\` is generally only seen on UNIX-derived operating systems, which typically do not provide for recovery of deleted files through a mechanism like the recycle bin, hence the tendency for users to enclose \`rm\` in some kind of wrapper to limit accidental file deletion. There are undelete utilities that will attempt to reconstruct the index and can bring the file back if the parts were not reused.  History  On some old versions of Unix, the \`rm\` command would delete directories if they were empty. This behaviour can still be obtained in some versions of \`rm\` with the \`-d\` flag, e.g., the BSDs (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS) derived from 4.4BSD-Lite2. The version of \`rm\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, Richard Stallman, and Jim Meyering. This version also provides \`-d\` option, to help with compatibility. The same functionality is provided by the standard \`rmdir\` command. The \`-i\` option in Version 7 replaced \`dsw\`, or \\"delete from switches\\", which debuted in Version 1. Doug McIlroy wrote that \`dsw\` \\"was a desperation tool designed to clean up files with unutterable names\\". KolibriOS includes an implementation of the command. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.  Syntax  \`rm\` deletes the file specified after options are added. Users can use a full path or a relative file path to specify the files to delete. \`rm\` doesn't delete a directory by default. % rm foo deletes the file \\"foo\\" in the directory the user is currently in. \`rm\`, like other commands, uses options to specify how it will behave: *\`-r\`, \\"recursive,\\" which removes directories, removing the contents recursively beforehand (so as not to leave files without a directory to reside in). *\`-i\`, \\"interactive\\" which asks for every deletion to be confirmed. *\`-f\`, \\"force,\\" which ignores non-existent files and overrides any confirmation prompts (effectively canceling \`-i\`), although it will not remove files from a directory if the directory is write-protected. *\`-v\`, \\"verbose,\\" which prints what \`rm\` is doing onto the terminal *\`-d\`, \\"directory,\\" which deletes an empty directory, and only works if the specified directory is empty. *\`--one-file-system\`, only removes files on the same file system as the argument, and will ignore mounted file systems. \`rm\` can be overlain by a shell alias (C shell alias, Bourne shell or Bash) function of \\"\`rm -i\`\\" so as to avoid accidental deletion of files. If a user still wishes to delete a large number of files without confirmation, they can manually cancel out the \`-i\` argument by adding the \`-f\` option (as the option specified later on the expanded command line \\"\`rm -i -f\`\\" takes precedence). Unfortunately this approach generates dangerous habits towards the use of wildcarding, leading to its own version of accidental removals. \`rm -rf\` (variously, \`rm -rf /\`, \`rm -rf *\`, and others) is frequently used in jokes and anecdotes about Unix disasters. The \`rm -rf /\` variant of the command, if run by a superuser, would cause every file accessible from the present file system to be deleted from the machine. \`rm\` is often used in conjunction with xargs to supply a list of files to delete: xargs rm < filelist Or, to remove all PNG images in all directories below the current one: find . -name '*.png' -exec rm {} +  Permissions  Usually, on most filesystems, deleting a file requires write permission on the parent directory (and execute permission, in order to enter the directory in the first place). (Note that, confusingly for beginners, permissions on the file itself are irrelevant. However, GNU \`rm\` asks for confirmation if a write-protected file is to be deleted, unless the -f option is used.) To delete a directory (with \`rm -r\`), one must delete all of its contents recursively. This requires that one must have read and write and execute permission to that directory (if it's not empty) and all non-empty subdirectories recursively (if there are any). The read permissions are needed to list the contents of the directory in order to delete them. This sometimes leads to an odd situation where a non-empty directory cannot be deleted because one doesn't have write permission to it and so cannot delete its contents; but if the same directory were empty, one would be able to delete it. If a file resides in a directory with the sticky bit set, then deleting the file requires one to be the owner of the file.  Protection of the filesystem root  Sun Microsystems introduced \\"\`rm -rf /\`\\" protection in Solaris 10, first released in 2005. Upon executing the command, the system now reports that the removal of / is not allowed. Shortly after, the same functionality was introduced into FreeBSD version of \`rm\` utility. GNU \`rm\` refuses to execute \`rm -rf /\` if the \`--preserve-root\` option is given, which has been the default since version 6.4 of GNU Core Utilities was released in 2006. In newer systems, this failsafe is always active, even without the option. To run the command, user must bypass the failsafe by adding the option \`--no-preserve-root\`, even if they are the superuser.  User-proofing  Systems administrators, designers, and even users often attempt to defend themselves against accidentally deleting files by creating an alias or function along the lines of: alias rm=\\"rm -i\\" rm () { /bin/rm -i \\"$@\\" ; } This results in \`rm\` asking the user to confirm on a file-by-file basis whether it should be deleted, by pressing the Y or N key. Unfortunately, this tends to train users to be careless about the wildcards they hand into their \`rm\` commands, as well as encouraging a tendency to alternately pound \`y\` and the return key to affirm removes - until just past the one file they needed to keep. Users have even been seen going as far as \\"\`yes  rm files\`\\", which automatically inserts \\"y\\" for each file. A compromise that allows users to confirm just once, encourages proper wildcarding, and makes verification of the list easier can be achieved with something like: if [ -n \\"$PS1\\" ] ; then rm () { ls -FCsd \\"$@\\" echo 'remove[ny]? '  tr -d '\\\\012' ; read if [ \\"_$REPLY\\" = \\"_y\\" ]; then /bin/rm -rf \\"$@\\" else echo '(cancelled)' fi } fi It's important to note that this function should not be made into a shell script, which would run a risk of it being found ahead of the system \`rm\` in the search path, nor should it be allowed in non-interactive shells where it could break batch jobs. Enclosing the definition in the \`if [ -n \\"$PS1\\" ] ; then .... ; fi\` construct protects against the latter. There exist third-party alternatives which prevent accidental deletion of important files, such as \\"safe-rm\\" or \\"trash\\".

There are actually several species of \\"giant clams\\" in the genus Tridacna, which are often misidentified for Tridacna gigas, the most commonly intended species referred to as ‚Äúthe giant clam‚Äù. Tridacna gigas is one of the most endangered clam species. Antonio Pigafetta documented these in his journal as early as 1521. One of a number of large clam species native to the shallow coral reefs of the South Pacific and Indian oceans, they can weigh more than , measure as much as across and have an average lifespan in the wild of over 100 years. They are also found off the shores of the Philippines and in the South China Sea in the coral reefs of Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). The giant clam lives in flat coral sand or broken coral and can be found at depths of as much as 20 m (66 ft).Knop, p. 10. Its range covers the Indo-Pacific, but populations are diminishing quickly, and the giant clam has become extinct in many areas where it was once common. The maxima clam has the largest geographical distribution among giant clam species; it can be found off high- or low-elevation islands, in lagoons or fringing reefs. Its rapid growth rate is likely due to its ability to cultivate algae in its body tissue. Although larval clams are planktonic, they become sessile in adulthood. The creature's mantle tissues act as a habitat for the symbiotic single-celled dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) from which the adult clams get most of their nutrition. By day, the clam opens its shell and extends its mantle tissue so that the algae receive the sunlight they need to photosynthesise.  Anatomy  Young T. gigas are difficult to distinguish from other species of Tridacninae. Adult T. gigas are the only giant clams unable to close their shells completely. Even when closed, part of the mantle is visible, unlike the very similar T. derasa. However, this can only be recognized with increasing age and growth. Small gaps always remain between shells through which retracted brownish-yellow mantle can be seen.Knop, p. 32. Tridacna gigas has four or five vertical folds in its shell; this is the main characteristic that separates it from the similar shell of T. derasa, which has six or seven vertical folds. As with massive deposition of coral matrices composed of calcium carbonate, the bivalves containing zooxanthellae have a tendency to grow massive calcium carbonate shells. The mantle's edges are packed with symbiotic zooxanthellae that presumably utilize carbon dioxide, phosphates, and nitrates supplied by the clam. The mantle border itself is covered in several hundred eyespots about .5mm in diameter. Each one consists of a small cavity containing a pupil-like aperture and a base of one hundred or more photoreceptors. These receptors allow T. gigas to respond to sudden dimming of light by withdrawing their mantles and partially closing their shells, presumably to protect from potential predators. They do not retract their mantles in response to increased illumination, but it has been observed that a change in the direction of light results in a shift in mantle orientation. In addition to a dimming response, T. gigas also responds to the movement of an object before a shadow has been cast. In order for this to happen, an image forming optical system is required as the response is based on the local dimming of one part of the generated image relative to the rest. This sequential dimming of receptors caused by the movement of a dark object allows enough time for the mantle to be retracted before a potential predator is directly overhead and casting a shadow.  Largest specimens  The largest known T. gigas specimen measured . It was discovered around 1817 on the north western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The weight of the two shells was . This suggests that the live weight of the animal would have been roughly . Today these shells are on display in a museum in Northern Ireland.Knop, p. 31. Another unusually large giant clam was found in 1956 off the Japanese island of Ishigaki. However, it was not examined scientifically before 1984. The shell's length was and the weight of the shells and soft parts was . Scientists estimated the live weight to be around .

These plants consist of unicellular algae, whose metabolic products add to the clam's filter food. As a result, they are able to grow as large as one meter in length even in nutrient-poor coral-reef waters. The clams cultivate algae in a special circulatory system which enables them to keep a substantially higher number of symbionts per unit of volume. In small clams‚Äî dry tissue weight‚Äîfilter feeding provides about 65% of total carbon needed for respiration and growth; large clams (10 g) acquire only 34% of carbon from this source. A single species of zooxenthellae may be symbionts of both giant clams and nearby reef‚Äìbuilding (hermatypic) corals.  Reproduction  Tridacna gigas reproduce sexually and are hermaphrodites (producing both eggs and sperm). Self-fertilization is not possible, but this characteristic does allow them to reproduce with any other member of the species. This reduces the burden of finding a compatible mate, while simultaneously doubling the number of offspring produced by the process. As with all other forms of sexual reproduction, hermaphroditism ensures that new gene combinations be passed to further generations.Knop, p. 46. Since giant clams cannot move themselves, they adopt broadcast spawning, releasing sperm and eggs into the water. A transmitter substance called spawning induced substance (SIS) helps synchronize the release of sperm and eggs to ensure fertilization. The substance is released through a syphonal outlet. Other clams can detect SIS immediately. Incoming water passes chemoreceptors situated close to the incurrent syphon, which transmit the information directly to the cerebral ganglia, a simple form of brain.Knop, p. 47. Detection of SIS stimulates the giant clam to swell its mantle in the central region and to contract its adductor muscle. Each clam then fills its water chambers and closes the incurrent syphon. The shell contracts vigorously with the adductor's help, so the excurrent chamber's contents flows through the excurrent syphon. After a few contractions containing only water, eggs and sperm appear in the excurrent chamber and then pass through the excurrent syphon into the water. Female eggs have a diameter of . Egg release initiates the reproductive process. An adult T. gigas can release more than 500 million eggs at a time.Knop, p. 48. Spawning seems to coincide with incoming tides near the second (full), third, and fourth (new) quarters of the moon phase. Spawning contractions occur every two or three minutes, with intense spawning ranging from thirty minutes to two and a half hours. Clams that do not respond to the spawning of neighboring clams may be reproductively inactive.  Development  The fertilized egg floats in the sea for about 12 hours until eventually a larva (trocophore) hatches. It then starts to produce a calcium carbonate shell. Two days after fertilization it measures . Soon it develops a \\"foot,\\" which is used to move on the ground; it can also swim to search for appropriate habitat.Knop, p. 49. At roughly one week of age, the clam settles on the ground, although it changes location frequently within the first few weeks. The larva does not yet have symbiotic algae, so it depends completely on plankton. Free floating zooxanthellae are also captured while filtering food. Eventually the front adductor muscle disappears and the rear muscle moves into the clam's center. Many small clams die at this stage. The clam is considered a juvenile when it reaches a length of .Knop, p. 53. It is difficult to observe the growth rate of T. gigas in the wild, but laboratory-reared giant clams have been observed to grow a year.  Human relevance  One of the two clam stoups of the √âglise Saint-Sulpice in Paris, carved by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle Piece of giant clam shell used as an ancient Egyptian paint holder The main reason that giant clams are becoming endangered is likely to be intensive exploitation by bivalve fishing vessels. Mainly large adults are killed, since they are the most profitable.Knop, p. 33. The giant clam is considered a delicacy in Japan (known as himejako), France, South East Asia and many Pacific Islands. Some Asian foods include the meat from the muscles of clams. On the black market, giant clam shells are sold as decorative accoutrements. At times large amounts of money were paid for the adductor muscle, which Chinese people believed have aphrodisiac powers.Knop, p. 11. A team of American and Italian researchers analyzed bivalves and found they were rich in amino acids that trigger increased levels of sex hormones. Their high zinc content aids the production of testosterone.  Legend  As is often the case with uncharacteristically large species, the giant clam has been historically misunderstood. It was known in times past as the \\"killer clam\\" and \\"man-eating clam\\", and reputable scientific and technical manuals once claimed that the great mollusc had caused deaths; versions of the U.S. Navy Diving Manual even gave detailed instructions for releasing oneself from its grasp by severing the adductor muscles used to close its shell. In an account of the discovery of the Pearl of Lao Tzu, Wilburn Cobb said he was told that a Dyak diver was drowned when the Tridacna closed its shell on his arm.Accounts by Wilburn Dowell Cobb . pearlforpeace.org Today the giant clam is considered neither aggressive nor particularly dangerous. While it is certainly capable of gripping a person, the shell's closing action is defensive, not aggressive, and the shell valves close too slowly to pose a serious threat. Furthermore, many large individuals are unable to completely close their shells.  Aquaculture  Mass culture of giant clams began at the Micronesian Mariculture Demonstration Center in Palau (belau). A large Australian government-funded project from 1985 to 1992 mass-cultured giant clams, particularly T. gigas at James Cook University's Orpheus Island Research Station, and supported the development of hatcheries in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines.Copland, J.W. and J.S. lucas (Eds.) 1988. Giant Clams in Asia and the Pacific. ACIAR Monograph No. 9Fitt W.K (Ed.) 1993. Biology and Mariculture of Giant Clams; a workshop held in conjunction with the 7th International Coral Reef Symposium, 21‚Äì26 June 1992, Guam, USA Recent developments in aquaculture, specifically at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida, and in the Marshall Islands, have succeeded in tank-raising T. gigas, both for use in home aquariums and for release into the wild. Seven of the ten known species of giant clams in the world are found in the coral reefs of the South China Sea. A programme to propagate endangered giant clams for release into the wild has been ongoing since 2007. Undertaken by the Marine Ecology Research Centre (www.merc- gayana.com) based in Gaya Island just west of Sabah‚Äôs capital, Kota Kinabalu, the programme successfully nurtured all seven species of the giant clams found in Malaysian waters to sufficient maturity for them to be placed in an ocean nursery for the first time during an awareness month from 22 March until 22 April 2012 in Maloham Bay. This marine awareness month had been planned to highlight and celebrate MERC's success in raising the giant clam larvae (called \\"spats\\") to juvenile stage, to highlight the importance of the giant clams and to raise awareness and support with the general public on the threats that are faced by the giant clams within the sea. During this marine awareness month, the coral restoration programme entered its final stage and attachment of 1000 one-year-old coral fragments grown at MERC's ocean nursery onto the coral reef were done throughout the month. The coral restoration programme is aimed to provide the giant clams with a suitable home surroundings when they are big enough in the future to be placed onto the reef.  Conservation status  There is concern among conservationists about whether those who use the species as a source of livelihood are overexploiting it. The numbers in the wild have been greatly reduced by extensive harvesting for food and the aquarium trade.

This bleeding may originate from the uterus, vaginal wall, or cervix. Generally, it is either part of a normal menstrual cycle or is caused by hormonal or other problems of the reproductive system, such as abnormal uterine bleeding. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy may indicate a possible pregnancy complication that needs to be medically addressed. Blood loss per vaginam (Latin: through the vagina) (PV) typically arises from the lining of the uterus (endometrium), but may arise from uterine or cervical lesions, the vagina, and rarely from the fallopian tube. During pregnancy it is usually but not always related to the pregnancy itself. Regular monthly vaginal bleeding during the reproductive years, menstruation, is a normal physiologic process. During the reproductive years, bleeding that is excessively heavy (menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding), occurs between monthly menstrual periods (intermenstrual bleeding), occurs more frequently than every 21 days (abnormal uterine bleeding), occurs too infrequently (oligomenorrhea), or occurs after vaginal intercourse (postcoital bleeding) should be evaluated. The causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding vary by age, and such bleeding can be a sign of specific medical conditions ranging from hormone imbalances or anovulation to malignancy (cervical cancer, vaginal cancer or uterine cancer). In young children, or elderly adults with cognitive impairment, the source of bleeding may not be obvious, and may be from the urinary tract (hematuria) or the rectum rather than the vagina, although most adult women can identify the site of bleeding. When vaginal bleeding occurs in prepubertal children or in postmenopausal women, it always needs medical attention.  Differential diagnosis  The parameters for normal menstruation have been defined as a result of an international process designed to simplify terminologies and definitions for abnormalities of menstrual bleeding. The causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding vary by age.  In children  Bleeding in children is of concern if it occurs before the expected time of menarche and in the absence of appropriate pubertal development. Bleeding before the onset of pubertal development deserves evaluation. It could result from local causes or from hormonal factors. In children, it may be challenging to determine the source of bleeding, and \\"vaginal\\" bleeding may actually arise from the bladder or urethra, or from the rectum. Vaginal bleeding in the first week of life after birth is a common observation, and pediatricians typically discuss this with new mothers at the time of hospital discharge. During childhood, other possible causes include the presence of a foreign body in the vagina, trauma (either accidental or non accidental, ie child sexual abuse or molestation), urethral prolapse, vaginal infection (vaginitis), vulvar ulcers, vulvar skin conditions such as lichen sclerosus, and rarely, a tumor (benign or malignant vaginal tumors, or hormone-producing ovarian tumors). Hormonal causes include central precocious puberty, or peripheral precocious puberty (McCune-Albright syndrome), or primary hypothyroidism. While the symptom is typically alarming to parents, most causes are benign, although sexual abuse or tumor are particularly important to exclude. An examination under anesthesia (EUA) may be necessary to exclude a vaginal foreign body or tumor, although instruments designed for office hysteroscopy can sometimes be used in children with topical anesthesia for office vaginoscopy, precluding the need for sedation or general anesthesia and operating room time.  Premenopausal  In premenopausal women, bleeding may occur as a result of a pregnancy complication, such as a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or abnormal growth of the placenta, even if the woman is not aware of the pregnancy. This possibility must be kept in mind with regard to diagnosis and management. In addition, the possibility that the bleeding does not arise from the uterus itself must be kept in mind, and a gynecologic examination should be performed to look for vulvar or vaginal lesions, and cervical causes of bleeding such as cervicitis from an STI. The causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women who are not pregnant have been classified using the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) PALM-COEIN system. This acronym stands for Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy and Hyperplasia, Coagulopathy, Ovulatory Disorders, Endometrial Disorders, Iatrogenic Causes, and Not Classified. The FIGO Menstrual Disorders Group, with input from international experts, recommended a simplified description of abnormal bleeding that discarded imprecise terms such as menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, hypermenorrhea, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in favor of plain English descriptions of bleeding that describe the vaginal bleeding in terms of cycle regularity, frequency, duration, and volume. The PALM causes are related to uterine structural, anatomic, and histolopathologic causes that can be assessed with imaging techniques such as ultrasound or biopsy to view the histology of a lesion.Endometrial polypsare benign growths that are typically detected during gynecologic ultrasonography and confirmed using saline infusion sonography or hysteroscopy, often in combination with an endometrial biopsyproviding histopathologic confirmation. Endocervical polyps are visible at the time of a gynecologic examination using a vaginal speculum, and can often be removed with a minor office procedure. Adenomyosis is a condition in which endometrial glands are present within the muscle of the uterus (myometrium), and the pathogenesis and mechanism by which it causes abnormal bleeding have been debated. Uterine leiomyoma, commonly termed uterine fibroids, are common, and most fibroids are asymptomatic. The presence of leiomyomas may not be the cause of abnormal bleeding, although fibroids that are submucosal in location are the most likely to cause abnormal bleeding. The Malignancy and Hyperplasia category of the PALM-COEIN system includes malignancies of the genital tract, including cancers of the vulva, the vagina, the cervix, and the uterus. Endometrial hyperplasia, included in this PALM category of abnormal bleeding, is more common in women who are obese or who have a history of chronic anovulation. When endometrial hyperplasia is associated with atypical cells, it can progress to cancer or occur concurrently with it. While endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial canceroccur most commonly among post-menopausal women, most women with endometrial cancer have abnormal bleeding, and thus the diagnosis must be considered in women during the reproductive years. The COEIN causes of abnormal bleeding are not related to structural causes. Causes of abnormal bleeding, most commonly heavy menstrual bleeding, can be related to blood clotting disorders, or Coagulopathies. Von Willebrand disease is the most common coagulopathy, and most women with von Willebrand disease have heavy menstrual bleeding. Of women with heavy menstrual bleeding, up to 20% will have a bleeding disorder. Heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche is a common symptom for women with bleeding disorders, and in retrospective studies, bleeding disorders have been found in up to 62% of adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding. Ovulatory dysfunction or anovulation is a common cause of abnormal bleeding that may lead to irregular and unpredictable bleeding, as well as variations in the amount of flow including heavy bleeding. Endocrine causes of ovulatory disorders include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, obesity, eating disorders including anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or to an imbalance between exercise and caloric intake. Endometrial causes of abnormal bleeding include infection of the endometrium, endometritis, which may occur after a miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) or a delivery, or may be related to a sexually-transmitted infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes or pelvis generally termed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Other endometrial causes of abnormal bleeding may relate to the ways that the endometrium heals itself or develops blood vessels. The most common Iatrogenic cause of abnormal bleeding relates to treatment with hormonal medications such as birth control pills, patches, rings, injections, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Hormone therapy for treatment of menopausal symptoms can also cause abnormal bleeding. Unscheduled bleeding that occurs during such hormonal treatment is termed \\"breakthrough bleeding\\" (BTB) Breakthrough bleeding may result from inconsistent use of hormonal treatment, although in the initial months after initiation of a method, it may occur even with perfect use, and may ultimately affect adherence to the medication regimen. The risk of breakthrough bleeding with oral contraceptives is greater if pills are missed. The Not Classified category of the PALM-COEIN system includes conditions that may be rare, or whose contribution to abnormal bleeding has not been well established or understood.  Pregnancy  Vaginal bleeding occurs during 15-25% of first trimester pregnancies. Of these, half go on to miscarry and half bring the fetus to term. There are a number of causes including rupture of a small vein on the outer rim of the placenta. It can also herald a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, which is why urgent ultrasound is required to separate the two causes. Bleeding in early pregnancy may be a sign of a threatened or incomplete miscarriage. In the second or third trimester a placenta previa (a placenta partially or completely overlying the cervix) may bleed quite severely. Placental abruption is often associated with uterine bleeding as well as uterine pain.  Postmenopausal  Endometrial atrophy, uterine fibroids, and endometrial cancer are common causes of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. About 10% of cases are due to endometrial cancer. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors made of muscle cells and other tissues located in and around the wall of the uterus. Women with fibroids do not always have symptoms, but some experience vaginal bleeding between periods, pain during sex, and lower back pain.  Diagnosis  Sonohysterography performed because of postmenopausal bleeding. In serial images, polyps would be more immobile than freely moving debris within the uterine cavity which are seen in the image. The cause of the bleeding can often be discerned on the basis of the bleeding history, physical examination, and other medical tests as appropriate. The physical examination for evaluating vaginal bleeding typically includes visualization of the cervix with a speculum, a bimanual exam, and a rectovaginal exam. These are focused on finding the source of the bleeding and looking for any abnormalities that could cause bleeding. In addition, the abdomen is examined and palpated to ascertain if the bleeding is abdominal in origin. Typically a pregnancy test is performed as well. If bleeding was excessive or prolonged, a CBC may be useful to check for anemia. Abnormal endometrium may have to be investigated by a hysteroscopy with a biopsy or a dilation and curettage. In an emergency or acute setting, vaginal bleeding can lead to hypovolemia. Postcoital bleeding is bleeding that occurs after sexual intercourse. The treatment will be directed at the cause. Hormonal bleeding problems during the reproductive years, if bothersome to the woman, are frequently managed by use of combined oral contraceptive pills. Postmenopausal bleeding In postmenopausal bleeding, guidelines from the United States consider transvaginal ultrasonography to be an appropriate first-line procedure to identify which women are at higher risk of endometrial cancer. A cut-off threshold of 3 mm or less of endometrial thickness should be used for in women with postmenopausal bleeding in the following cases: * Not having used hormone replacement therapy for a year or more * Usage of continuous hormone replacement therapy consisting of both an estrogen and a progestogen A cut-off threshold of 5 mm or less should be used for women on sequential hormone replacement therapy consisting both of an estrogen and a progestogen. It the endometrial thickness equals the cut-off threshold or is thinner, and the ultrasonography is otherwise reassuring, no further action need be taken. Further investigations should be carried out if symptoms recur. If the ultrasonography is not reassuring, hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy should be performed. The biopsy may be obtained either by curettage at the same time as inpatient or outpatient hysteroscopy, or by using an endometrium sampling device such as a pipelle which can practically be done directly after the ultrasonography. FIGO classification FIGO System 1. The system for definition and nomenclature of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years. In 2011, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recognized two systems designed to aid research, education, and clinical care of women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years.  Complications  Severe acute bleeding, such as caused by ectopic pregnancy and post-partum hemorrhage, leads to hypovolemia (the depletion of blood from the circulation), progressing to shock. This is a medical emergency and requires hospital attendance and intravenous fluids, usually followed by blood transfusion. Once the circulating volume has been restored, investigations are performed to identify the source of bleeding and address it. Uncontrolled life-threatening bleeding may require uterine artery embolization (occlusion of the blood vessels supplying the uterus), laparotomy (surgical opening of the abdomen), occasionally leading to hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) as a last resort. A possible complication from protracted vaginal blood loss is iron deficiency anemia, which can develop insidiously. Eliminating the cause will resolve the anemia, although some women require iron supplements or blood transfusions to improve the anemia.

She was named for Fort Snelling at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, for many years the northernmost military post in the land of the Sioux and Chippewa. She was the second ship assigned that name, but the construction of was canceled on 17 August 1945. Fort Snelling (LSD-30) was laid down on 17 August 1953 by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss.; launched on 16 July 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Robert P. Briscoe, wife of Vice Admiral Briscoe; and commissioned on 24 January 1955, Commander H. Marvin-Smith in command. Service history Homeported at Norfolk, Virginia, Fort Snelling carried out an intensive exercise schedule along the east coast and in the Caribbean, almost always with Marines embarked for amphibious training. She made her first deployment to the Mediterranean in 1956, returning the next year again to serve with the 6th Fleet. During her 1958 deployment, she was at sea bound for the island of Rhodes when on 14 July she was notified to land her Marines at Beirut, Lebanon, the next day. Thus, Fort Snelling took part in the immediate response of the U.S. Navy to the Middle Eastern crisis of summer 1958. Several times more before leaving the Mediterranean she returned to the coast of Lebanon to support the Marines ashore. Through 1959 and 1963, Fort Snelling continued her training operations with marines in the Caribbean and on the Carolina coast. In April 1965, Fort Snelling was ordered to the Dominican Republic as part of a task force which included the USS Boxer (LPH-4), USS Rankin (AKA-103), USS Wood County (LST-1178), USS Ruchamakin (APD-89), USS Yancey (AKA-93) and USS Raleigh (LPD-1). Its main mission along with the task force was to deploy marines to evacuate U.S., Canadian and British citizens. Some 14,000 marines participated. In 1966, while returning from a Mediterranean deployment, Fort Snelling was assigned as task group commander of the Navy's Palomares Incident recovery operations. Because of her large well deck, Fort Snelling carried the deep diving submarine Aluminaut.Melson, June 1967, p.31 In addition, Fort Snelling also deployed the small submarine Alvin from its flight deck via its cranes. In 1966, she participated in the extraction of U.S. Marines from the Dominican Republican crisis. in October 1969 Fort Snelling proceeded south to the Ascension area and participated as a secondary recovery ship in the first Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) test launch. As she passed the equator a raucous ‚Äúcrossing the line‚Äù ceremony was held in the welldeck aft. Even Captain Henry Hansen USN was initiated along with a throng of other ‚Äúpollywogs. Test flight OPS 0855 for MOL was launched on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 UTC on a Titan IIIC-9 from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 40. The flight consisted of a MOL mockup built from a Titan II propellant tank, and the refurbished capsule from the Gemini 2 mission as a prototype Gemini B spacecraft. After the Gemini B prototype separated for a sub-orbital reentry, the MOL mockup continued into orbit and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's heat shield‚Äîintended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations‚Äîwas tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic by the USS La Salle after a flight of 33 minutes. On 3 April 1978, Fort Snelling and the replenishment oiler collided north of Corsica when the Waccamaw lost steering control during refueling. Despite structural damage both ships proceeded under their own power to Naples, Italy, for repairs. In August 1982, Fort Snelling embarked members of 24 MAU for a Med cruise. Over the course of 7 months, the Fort Snelling participated amphibious landings in Denmark, Germany, and Turkey, with a liberty call at the Port of Naples, Italy. After a 5 day liberty, the Fort Snelling and other members of her squadron rushed the 24 MAU to Beirut Lebanon to become the backbone of the Multi National Peacekeeping Force. In early March 1983, the 24 MAU was relieved by the 22 MAU. The 24 MAU was then returned Stateside by the Fort Snelling and her squadron mates. In October 1983, Fort Snelling participated in Operation Urgent Fury (the US invasion of Grenada) as part of Amphibious Squadron Four (PHIBRON-4). Prior to H-hour, six frogmen from SEAL Team 4 departed the Fort Snelling in a SeaFox, a 36-foot, fiberglass-hulled craft, on a night reconnaissance mission. The team surveyed a beach on the eastern shore of the island that been identified as the preferred amphibious landing site. The beach was found unsuitable. Marines from the 22 MAU instead landed at dawn on Grenada by helicopter. Later on D-Day, the Fort Snelling and the USS Manitowoc transited to the western shore of the island to open a second front on the enemy forces. Tanks and jeeps from the Fort Snelling were put ashore after a beachhead at Grand Mal Bay was secured by 13 amphibious landing craft from the Manitowoc. Upon conclusion of Operation Urgent Fury, Ft. Snelling continued on her deployment with PHIBRON-4 to support peacekeeping operations in Lebanon. During March 1984, Ft. Snelling assisted in the evacuation of noncombatants from Beirut, conducting flight operations and subsequently transporting hundreds of evacuees to Cyprus. The US Navy forces had published Notices to Mariners not to approach within 2,000 yards of navy ships. While Ft Snelling was conducting fueling operations with USS Sylvania, it was struck by a merchant vessel - the merchant sunk in approximately 20 minutes. Leading many to believe the collision was intentional. The damage suffered from the impact led to her decommissioning following the deployment. Fort Snelling was decommissioned on 28 September 1984 and transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 7 September 1989. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 February 1992 and she was sold for scrapping on 25 August 1995 to Peck Recycling, Richmond, Virginia, for $268,707.

The scientific name refers to Lake Managua in Nicaragua from where the holotype was obtained. It is a food fish and is also found in the aquarium trade where it is variously known as the jaguar cichlid, managuense cichlid, managua cichlid, guapote tigre, Aztec cichlid, spotted guapote and jaguar guapote. In Costa Rica it is known as the guapote tigre. Males grow to a total length of and females to . The species is a carnivorous, highly predatory fish. Their diet consists mainly of small fish and macroinvertebrates. They prefer turbid, eutrophic lakes, often found in warm water depleted of oxygen. Their native substrate is one of mud-bottoms, but can also be found in other ponds and springs with sandy bottoms covered in plant debris. They inhabit lakes in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 7.0‚Äì8.7 pH, a water hardness of 10‚Äì15 dGH, and a temperature range of 25 to 36 ¬∞C (77 to 97 ¬∞F). They are usually found at depths of from . Aquarium care P. managuensis is the most commonly traded species of its genus and is greatly valued among the aquarium trade. As with all members of the genus, the jaguar cichlid is a large, aggressive and territorial member of the Cichlidae. The jaguar cichlid is a sizable, robust cichlid, displaying a shade of yellow/bronze throughout the body. This yellow colouration is then scattered with vivid black spots which are seen all along the flanks and gill plates. A series of several large black dots then run horizontally along the lateral line area. The fins are often a dark to black colouration, especially when in spawning colouration. The female is similarly colored, but generally smaller than the male. The female will also lack the elongated extensions to the dorsal fins. This fish may also be found in Honduras and the rest of Central America where it plays a great role in the fishing industry. It is highly advisable that a breeding pair of jaguar cichlids, or any other member of the Parachromis, are kept singularly, with the exception of very large aquaria, as a breeding pair will become hyper- aggressive, and pose great danger to any other fish in the tank. Breeding Breeding can be achieved with very little effort and no specific requirements are needed for such purposes. As long as water conditions are maintained at a desirable high quality, a breeding pair of jaguar cichlids will readily spawn. To enhance the likelihood of acquiring a breeding pair, purchase several healthy and active juveniles at a young age (between 6 and 10) and grow these specimens until sexual maturity. Generally, you should be left with a breeding pair or two. These fish will noticeably become more aggressive and territorial, Remove all other fish at this point and keep the newly formed breeding pair separate. When a breeding pair had been successfully established, the male will begin to court the female by displaying his erect finnage as he tries to impress her in an attempt for her to accept his mating invitation. The pair will begin to clean a flat surface if the female is responsive of the male's previous courting behavior. The female with then lay approximately 1000‚Äì2000 orange coloured eggs which will then be fertilized by the male. The eggs will be ferociously guarded by both parents and a high degree of parental care is shown to the eggs and fry. When the eggs 'hatch' after approximately 5 to 7 days, the offspring (known as wrigglers at this stage in development) are defenseless and are unable to swim. They are often transported to pre-dug pits by both parents, and are guarded. The fry will begin to swim in approximately 7 days and should be fed with baby brine shrimp or alike. If you would like to rear these fry, they should be removed at this point as they will later be consumed by both parents as the female becomes due to spawn once more. Feed the fry baby brine shrimp until the stage where they are large enough to consume blood worm, daphnia and other live foods. When purchasing fish in an attempt to acquire a breeding pair, try to buy fish from different sources. There is a high probability that when buying fish from the same source, Fish will be from the same parents (Siblings). This should be avoided, as breeding fish in this manner may form offspring with genetic disease usually associated with interbreeding. Also, buy fish of a similar size, the chances of acquiring a breeding pair with fish of a similar size is significant to that of attempting to breed fish of different age and size. Aquarium The aquarium should be large for a breeding pair of jaguar cichlids. As with all members of its genus, These fish are large and heavily built cichlids who are aggressive and highly territorial. Decor should be kept to a minimum in such an aquarium and sand or fine gravel should be used as the main substrate. Many pieces of flat slate or rock should also be included for the purpose of spawning. Diet The Parachromis are a highly predatory group of fish and are by no means fussy eaters. Their ability to protrude their jaw 10% standard length allows them to have a diet composed of 90% evasive prey. These cichlids will readily accept most food substances offered. Diet should be varied however. Offer a variety of insect, including blood worm, earthworm, mysis, crickets (for larger specimens). Chopped meat can also be offered along with beef heart (offer very sparingly due to its high fat content) along with prawn and fish (live/frozen). Frozen fish is a much preferred method of feeding fish as many \\"feeder fish\\" carry the risk of the introducing disease into your aquarium, possibly harming your fish. Sexing Females are smaller than the male and the red pigment seems more prominent in the gill plates. The red colouration is significantly prominent in the female in breeding colors. The male's dorsal and ventral fins are also much more extended and elongated than the female's. Water chemistry pH of 7.0‚Äì7.8 preferably. Temperature of 25-27 ¬∞C. Conservation It occurs in the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge.

Dennis Brutus during a press conference at Schiphol Airport, 1967 Activist Brutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. He learned politics in the Trotskyist movement of the Eastern Cape. Although not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between blacks and coloureds. In 1958 he formed the South African Sports Association, and as Secretary was strongly opposed to a proposed cricket tour by Frank Worrell‚Äôs West Indies to South Africa in 1959, leading a successful campaign to have it cancelled. In 1962 Brutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organisation that would be heavily influential in the banning of apartheid-era South Africa from the Olympics in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC. As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.George Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain: Glimpses of Africa's Freedom Struggle(New York: Pilgrim Press, 1989), 273‚Äì276. Arrest and jail In 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his \\"banning,\\" which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he \\"jumped bail\\" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while he was in Mozambique, on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese colonial secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to Robben Island for 16 months, five in solitary. He was in the cell next to Nelson Mandela's. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, for which he had campaigned, broke. Brutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, Sirens, Knuckles and Boots (1963), was published in Nigeria while he was in prison. The book received the Mbari Poetry Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.Josh MacPhee, \\"242: Mbari Publishing\\", Justseeds, 20 September 2016.Dennis Brutus, The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23. He was the author of 14 books. Release from jail After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in Britain, where he first met George Houser, the Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa (ACOA). South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team. At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour, where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organisations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defence of those charged under the apartheid laws. The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games. In co-operation with SANROC, the ACOA organised a boycott of American athletes in February 1968. Jackie Robinson, the first African American athlete to break the colour barrier in major league baseball, published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. As a result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.ACOA, \\"Announcing Dennis Brutus,\\" found at: http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-B92 [accessed on 27 October 2017].ACOA, \\"Statement by Jackie Robinson and K.C.

Return to South Africa, poetry and activism He returned to South Africa and was based at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where he often contributed to the annual Poetry Africa Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with NGOs. In December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. At the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: According to fellow writer Olu Oguibe, interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the University of Connecticut, \\"Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after Leopold Sedar Senghor and Christopher Okigbo, certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher.\\" Brutus died of prostate cancer on 26 December 2009, at his home in Cape Town, South Africa. He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Byala Municipality and lies in a semi-mountainous region in the easternmost branches of Stara Planina about 50 km south of the city of Varna and 70 km north of Burgas. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 2,171 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 History One of Byala's beaches Saint Tryphon The first known settlement here, near Cape St. Athanasius (Sveti Atanas) just south of town, is dated back to the 6th century BC. Its Greek name was perhaps Larissa, later, Aspros (White). Later the Roman road service station Templum Iovis (Temple of Jupiter) was erected with a fortress nearby. The region became part of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD; the Bulgarian fortress of Vicha stood later perhaps on cape Beli Nos (Cape White) north of town. In the Ottoman period (from the late 14th century through 1878), a village known as Akdere (White creek) existed at the town's present location; it was later renamed Byala. A customs office between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia was temporarily established in 1878. Until the early 1900s, the majority of the population was ethnic Greek; with the population transfers between Bulgaria and Greece following World War I, about 75% of them are now ethnic Bulgarians tracing their ancestry to the village of Athira (Bulgarian: Bozets) in Greek Macedonia. Byala was declared town on 5 September 1984. Economy Byala's economy is based mostly on tourism and agriculture, including viticulture. There are several hotels, camping areas and beaches. There are attempts to develop \\"village tourism\\", a new concept that is believed to be interesting to foreigners. Nature landmarks outside Byala include Karadere, one of Bulgaria's last remaining wild beaches with pristine dunes and freshwater wetlands, and the White Cliffs (–ë–µ–ª–∏—Ç–µ —Å–∫–∞–ª–∏, Belite skali) displaying a classic Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary exposure; there is a demonstration centre. Cultural Buildings * Churches: \\"Sveta Paraskeva\\"; \\"Uspenie Bogorodichno\\" * Schools: Elementary School \\"Otets Paisii\\" (registered in 1880, built in 1894); Professional High School for Agriculture (founded in 1959); Kindergarten \\"Parvi yuni\\" * Stadium: Chernomoretz (built in 1986, seats 1000) * Chitalishte: \\"Probuda\\" (founded on 1 January 1928, an active local cultural and community centre) * Museum of Ethnography (founded in 1986) * Military Monuments (mainly commemorating the soldiers who died in World War II) Development The town is less developed compared to other tourist areas. The local government supports a few environmental and tourism projects. Byala's port is currently under reconstruction and is planned to become a yacht marina. There has been much new residential building undertaken between 2003 and 2006 due to perceived higher interest from foreign (particularly Danish and Dutch) investors and tourists. In December 2007, plans were announced for a carbon-neutral resort at Karadere beach, some 3 km north of Byala, Norman Foster's first project in Bulgaria. A series of car free hill towns in a setting of oak forests, meadows and river gorges, Black Sea Gardens will create a year-round community for up to 15,400 residents. Local groups oppose the project. They say it will turn Karadere beach into a 6-star closed resort complex. The territory is extremely important from an ecological standpoint being part of the Natura 2000 protected zones network and also vital part of bio-diversity zones in Via Pontica for preservation of the habitats of birds. Due to the wilderness of the territory and lack of any infrastructure, the project needs huge investments and after assessment of these or maybe other reasons, the original investor has backed off (July 2008). The Bulgarian government's failure to enact regulations outlawing extensive developments in such protected areas may have encouraged the project‚Äîeven more as Norman Foster's consulting architects company \\"Projects Ltd.\\" is owned and run by the brother of the Bulgarian Prime Minister.

He was the inventor of the 'Marquis' wheat cultivar. Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario is named for him and other members of his prominent family, including his father, agriculturist William Saunders and naturalist brother William Edwin Saunders. Early life and education Saunders was born in London, Canada West, on Feb. 2, 1867, son of William and Sarah Agnes Robinson Saunders. He received his early education in the elementary and collegiate system in London. He received a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from the University of Toronto in 1888. From 1888 to 1893, he specialized in chemistry at summer school at Harvard University. In 1891, he received a Ph.D for chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. He studied at the Sorbonne. Saunders learned most of what he knew about plant hybridization at home through his family. Some of his earliest memories are of driving with his father to a fruit farm outside the city limits, where he would help him hybridize grapes, currants, raspberries, and gooseberries. Saunders married Mary Blackwell of Toronto in 1892. Careers From 1892 to 1893, Saunders was the professor of chemistry and geology at Central University in Kentucky. Between 1894 and 1903, he studied flute with E. M. Heindl of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the New England Conservatory of Music and with Eugene Weiner of the New York Philharmonic Club. He also received voice training. In Toronto, in addition to acting as an agent, he gave lessons in singing and flute playing. In 1895-1896 Saunders was a columnist in The Week, writing about various aspects of music. His musical career was not a financial success, however. 1903 to 1920 1903 William Saunders, Charles' father, appointed him Experimentalist at the Experimental Farm in Ottawa in 1903, a title that became Cerealist in 1905 and Dominion Cerealist in 1910. The new work continued family tradition, for Saunders's father had founded the system of experimental farms established in Canada, and his brother, Percy, had done considerable work in cross-breeding strains of wheat. Saunders turned enthusiastically to his new tasks. Following up his brother's research, he completed development of 'Marquis' wheat in 1904, a cultivar which showed marked superiority in milling quality for bread flour over other varieties popular in western Canada. 'Marquis' had the advantage of maturing 10 days earlier than its competitors - a factor of great importance in the Canadian wheat belt. The Indian Head Experimental Farm in Saskatchewan raised 'Marquis' wheat for seed, and by 1909 its use was widespread. By 1920, 90% of the wheat grown in western Canada was 'Marquis'. However, 'Marquis' was not resistant to stem rust. In seeking newer and better varieties Saunders developed three other strains of wheat - 'Ruby', 'Garnet', and 'Reward' - specifically adapted to prairie conditions. He was also responsible for improved varieties of oats and barley. In the search for a hardy wheat that would mature faster, he made hundreds of crosses, proceeding to test the yields.* Tests included one called \\"chewing\\", whereby Saunders identified strains with strong gluten by chewing a few sample kernels. \\"I made more wheat into gum than was made by all the boys in any dozen rural schools of a generation ago.\\"Pomeroy, Elsie M.: William Saunders and His Five Sons: The Story of the Marquis Wheat Family, p. 141. Using a technique he devised himself, Saunders ground his own flour and baked his own bread in small loaves to measure volume. Working with 'Red Fife', which had been imported and developed by David Fife from Ontario, Saunders crossed it with 'Hard Red Calcutta'. The new cultivar 'Markham' showed great promise, but its offspring were not uniform. After many trials at the Agassiz experimental farm, a winner emerged - 'Marquis'. 1906 Surplus 'Marquis' seed was shipped to Indian Head, Saskatchewan, for additional testing. 1911 'Marquis' won the Canadian Pacific Railway Prize of $1,000.00 for the best bushel of hard spring wheat grown in North America. This was the first of many prizes. The only drawback of 'Marquis' was its susceptibility to rust. Not until 1947 was a rust-resistant variety developed at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa. It was named 'Saunders'. 1920-1922 1920 90% of the wheat crop in western Canada was 'Marquis'. Saunders also applied his methods to barley, oats, peas, beans, and flax, introducing several new cultivars of each. He wrote extensively on the subject and many of his thoughts on cereals were presented to scientific conferences and societies and printed in scientific magazines. Retirement In 1922, after suffering a physical breakdown, Saunders resigned his position and moved to Paris with his wife. 1922-1925 At the Sorbonne, he studied French literature. 1925 He returned to Ottawa briefly, but in 1928 he moved to Toronto. Though retired, he continued to lecture on 'Marquis' wheat and the French language. 1928 Essais et vers, a collection of Saunders' French essays and poems, was published by Louis Carrier and Cie, Les Editions du Mercure, in Montreal and New York. The work received critical acclaim in the French press, especially in Quebec. Death Saunders died in Toronto on July 25, 1937. Tributes to him came from around the world. In The London Daily Express, his obituary read: Honours * In 1921, Saunders was made a Fellow of The Royal Society of Canada. * In 1921, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws and Letters by the University of Western Ontario. * In 1925, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Toronto. * In 1925, he received the Royal Society of Canada's Flavelle Medal for Science. * He was knighted by King George V in 1934 for his contribution to agriculture. * In recognition of his work in the French language he was decorated by the French government and was presented with the Medaille de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He is a member of the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame.The Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame: The Hall, Canada Science and Technology Museum.

Semantic AI is a Delaware C-corporation that offers patented, graph-based knowledge discovery, analysis and visualization software technology. Its original product is a link analysis software application called Semantica Pro, and it has recently introduced a web-based analytical environment called the Cortex Enterprise Intelligence Platform, or Cortex EIP.  History  The SEMANTICA platform was originally conceived as a method to help biology students learn and retain knowledge about complex organic structures. Joe Faletti, Kathleen Fisher, and several colleagues in the University of California system created SemNet, a computer program used to draw a network of \\"concepts\\" connected to each other by \\"relations\\". In the late 1960s, Ross Quillian and Allan Collins used the concept of semantic networks as a way of talking about the organization of human semantic memory, or memory for inter-related word concepts. Using SemNet, students could employ simple components to build complex networks. After the 9/11 al-Qaeda terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, the U.S. Intelligence Community realized analysts desperately needed a way to \\"connect the dots\\"; they needed a platform to fuse data stored in separate silos and interrogate it in real time to answer intelligence questions. Recognizing the potential for SemNet to do that, Joe Faletti teamed up with Charles Gillespie, Chip Harrison and Chris Staszak to found Semantic Research, Inc. (SRI) in October 2001. The team of engineers and intelligence analysts at SRI expanded the SemNet program into SEMANTICA Pro, a network analysis program. Semantic Research achieved early adoption by U.S. Government customers including the intelligence community. SEMANTICA Pro was featured in CIOReview magazine among the \\"20 most promising defense technology solution providers\\" of 2015. SEMANTICA Pro has evolved into a desktop software application used to tackle difficult analytical challenges across a wide spectrum of industries and missions, including casinos and gaming, law enforcement, intelligence, financial services, advisory and consulting services, anti-money laundering compliance, and counter-terrorism operations. Since 2016, Semantic Research has expanded its commercial footprint. Today, several Fortune 500 companies are using SEMANTICA to combat fraud, comply with anti-money laundering regulations, conduct corporate due diligence investigations, and to identify and analyze security threats.

He attracted much media attention as part of a Wales national team which achieved Grand Slams in the Six Nations Championship in 2005 and 2008. He has also played for the British and Irish Lions, touring in 2005 to New Zealand but has never appeared at a World Cup. Henson has played in a variety of positions including fly-half, fullback and inside centre. After an extended spell out of the national side, including missing the 2007 Rugby World Cup, he was recalled by caretaker coach Nigel Davies, being included in the squad to play against South Africa. Since September 2010, Henson has participated in several reality television series: 71 Degrees North, Strictly Come Dancing, The Bachelor and Celebrity Hunted (2019). Henson has two children from his relationship with singer Charlotte Church. Rugby career=Llanelli RFC: 2000 Henson's one and only appearance for Llanelli RFC was against the then Border Reivers at Greenyards in May 2000. The Rievers won the match 51‚Äì23. Henson played at 10 and scored 5 points (1 conversion & 1 penalty). Swansea/Ospreys: 2000‚Äì2009 Born in Pencoed, Henson played rugby for his school, Brynteg Comprehensive, in Bridgend, Wales. Despite his Bridgend origins, he joined Swansea RFC at the age of 18. He was presented with the International Rugby Board's Young Player of the Year award in 2001. During this time, he had started paving the way to his international career by signing for the Wales A team. He made his international debut for Wales during June 2001 in a Test against Japan, coming off the bench. He then started his next match, at fly-half in a game against Romania on 19 September 2001. In November of that year, he played for Wales A against Uruguay, scoring his first try in an international. Ospreys In 2003, regional rugby was launched in Wales, and Henson played for the Ospreys. He made his debut for the Ospreys as a substitute on 9 September 2003 in a match against Ulster, scoring two tries and kicking both a penalty and conversion to score 15 points. He was moved to fly-half for the subsequent match against the Newport-Gwent Dragons, scoring 14 points from kicks. Henson returned to the international field for Wales in 2003. He played twice, and was on the bench for two other Tests. He was capped against both the All Blacks and Romania. Henson came to wider notice in 2004 with a series of performances in Wales' autumn internationals against New Zealand and South Africa. Henson became a firm part of the Welsh starting line-up, and after playing at fullback in the second Test against Argentina and the first against South Africa, he played in the centres for the remainder of the season. He remained on the team for the 2005 Six Nations Championship. In Wales' opening fixture in February, at home to England, Henson gave an effective performance; making two tackles on Mathew Tait (earning Tait the nickname 'Henson's Handbag') and landing the match- winning points with a 48 m penalty kick and being named man of the match. Back in his club side, Henson was part of a team which took the Celtic League cup: in the deciding match against Edinburgh on 26 March 2005, he scored 24 of his side's 29 points. In the northern hemisphere summer of the same year, Henson was named in the Lions squad for the tour of New Zealand. He was \\"devastated not to be playing\\" in the first Test. When he was selected for the second test, he was injured and could not play in the final test. A groin injury delayed his return to club rugby in the autumn of the year. Within months of his Ospreys return, Henson was cited for kicking and elbowing Leicester prop Alex Moreno in a game against Leicester on 19 December 2005. He was found not guilty of the kicking offence, but guilty of the elbowing. He was initially suspended for ten weeks and two days: this period was reduced on appeal to seven weeks. Following this suspension and a single game at club level, he returned to international rugby against Ireland. Wales. In October 2005, Henson's My Grand Slam Year was published. Comments about the Lions tour and remarks about other players ensured rapid publicity and Henson had to apologise to his teammates. He was not selected in the Wales squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup by then coach Gareth Jenkins, after he failed to prove his fitness after recovering from an Achilles tendon injury. Henson was recalled to the Welsh Squad by caretaker coach Nigel Davies, to play against South Africa shortly after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He then started for of all of Wales 2008 Six Nations Championship games, Wales then went on to win the Grand Slam for the second time in four seasons. Henson lost his first 6 Nations match in which he started on 21 March 2009 as Ireland beat Wales in Cardiff 17‚Äì15, to win the Grand Slam. Sabbatical: 2009‚Äì2010 On 13 July 2009, British tabloid, The Sun, announced that Henson planned to retire immediately from rugby. On 14 July 2009, Henson and the Ospreys issued a joint statement denying the player had any intention of quitting. Henson said, \\"I've certainly been having difficulties with the recurring injury but I have absolutely no intention of quitting the game\\". In 2009, Mike Turner of the Crusaders RL (who at that time played in the Super League) stated that if Henson ever thought of switching to rugby league the club would be happy to talk to him. Since this time, Henson has made no official statement on the subject, shown any intent with regards to joining a Super League club or held any talks with the Crusaders, although he regularly attended their matches in 2009. Comeback: 2010‚Äì2019 On 27 October 2010, Ospreys released a statement from Managing Director, Mike Cuddy, stating that Henson would be released from his contract with the province with immediate effect, and that he would be returning to rugby with the English club Saracens. Henson had not played professional Rugby for 18 months before this announcement following his period of unpaid leave from the Ospreys. Henson had been reported as having trained with Saracens two days prior to this announcement on 25 October 2010, leading to speculation that the return to professional rugby was imminent. Henson's agent, Matt Ginvert, stated that Henson will return to Rugby after completing his commitments with the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing programme, and Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths said that he saw no reason why Henson would not compete for the club before Christmas 2010. Henson signed for Saracens in October 2010, making his debut at Wembley Stadium in the Boxing Day 2010 match against London Wasps; his first competitive game since March 2009. After playing four games for Saracens, starting only one, Henson was released from his contract on 2 February 2011. The same day, French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported that Henson had met RC Toulonnais head coach Philippe Saint-Andr√© and club owner Mourad Boudjellal, for lunch in Toulon. The club, with their two first choice fly-halves out injured, had an available space in their squad under Top 14 regulations. Henson had commented while at Saracens that he was frustrated not to be playing in his preferred position. The following day, he signed a five-month contract with RC Toulonnais. In April 2011, he was suspended for two weeks following an incident on a night out after a match against Toulouse, involving an alleged fight with his teammates. After a hearing, RC Toulonnais President Boudjellal decided to reintegrate Henson back into the squad. However, on 24 May 2011, Henson was released by RC Toulonnais. On 4 June 2011, Henson played his first match for Wales in 2 years, starting against the Barbarians, Henson put in a good performance, although he described his match as merely \\"showing glimpses of what he can do\\". The match was a loss to the Barbarians, with Isa Nacewa scoring a try in the 79th minute, taking the score from 28‚Äì26 to Wales to 28‚Äì31 to the Barbarians. After the Barbarian match, Henson was named in the 45-man preliminary 2011 Rugby World Cup squad by new Wales coach Warren Gatland. On 11 August 2011, Henson started for Wales in a warmup test against rivals England at Millennium Stadium, but left late in the first half after dislocating his wrist. The following day, it was announced that surgery on his wrist would keep him out for six to eight weeks, and that he would not be available for the pool stages of the World Cup. In October 2011, it was announced by his agent and subsequently various media outlets, that Henson had signed for the Cardiff Blues. The club later confirmed the 8-month deal. On 2 April 2012, it was announced by Cardiff Blues that his contract had been terminated by the club after he was reported to be drinking and behaving inappropriately on a flight home from Scotland after a Blues match against Glasgow Warriors. The airline Flybe, which Henson was flying with, banned him from the airline for a six-month period. On 9 July 2012, newly promoted London Welsh announced that they had signed Henson for the 2012/13 season. On 13 June 2013, it was announced that Henson was to leave London Welsh, who had been relegated that year, to join Bath for the next season. He said \\"I am thrilled to be joining Bath this summer, and I look forward to becoming part of what looks a very exciting squad. I still very much want to be playing at the highest level, and Bath is a big Club with big plans. I know what is expected of me and I can't wait to get started.\\" On 10 July 2013, Henson was knocked out by Bath teammate Carl Fearns on a night out in the city. Having improved his recent form with Bath, including influential appearances in the centre. Due to this improved form Henson, reportedly, rejected an approach by the Newport Gwent Dragons to sign an extension to his Bath contract. Henson has been included in the Probables squad for the Wales trial match on 30 May 2014 in Swansea but was unable to take part due to Premier Rugby Limited's (the governing body of the English premiership) decision not to release non English players outside the IRB test window. On 23 January 2015, it was announced Henson would be leaving Bath to join RFU Championship side Bristol, at the end of the Aviva Premiership season on a one-year deal. However, on 11 February, he was released four months early from his Bath contract to take his place in the Bristol ranks, being replaced at Bath by incoming London Irish utility back Tom Homer. On 14 March 2017, Henson returned to Wales to sign for the Dragons, back in the Pro14, on a two-year contract from the 2017‚Äì18 season. Code change to rugby league After being released by the Dragons at the end of the 2018‚Äì2019 season, Henson retired and purchased a pub. On 18 September 2020 it was announced that he had changed codes and was joining rugby league team West Wales Raiders who play in league's third tier. In popular media In September 2010, he featured in the ITV1 outdoor series 71 Degrees North, a challenge show set in Norway in which he finished in 2nd place, losing out to Marcus Patric. He then featured as a contestant on BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing 's eighth series, partnered by Katya Virshilas. In August 2011 a series, The Bachelor, in which 25 young women battle it out on the French Riviera to win the heart of Henson \\"the Bachelor\\", began on Channel 5. He has been criticised for these appearances in the press and by many rugby fans. Henson is name-checked in the 2010 parody song \\"Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)\\", which gained over two million hits on YouTube, although local rap group Goldie Lookin Chain later criticised the song and pointed out that Henson \\"rarely ventured to Newport.\\" Personal life His relationship with singer Charlotte Church has been well covered by the media in the United Kingdom. On 20 September 2007, Church gave birth to a daughter. Henson was excused from a 13 December 2008 Heineken Cup match against Benetton Treviso because Church was due to deliver her second child prematurely, but this did not happen. On 11 January 2009, Church gave birth to the couple's second child, a son. On 31 May 2010 the couple announced that their relationship was over, only two months after they had announced their engagement. In 2011 Henson chose Carianne Barrow to be his girlfriend on reality television series The Bachelor. The couple split in March 2012. On 28 September 2019, Henson married his long term partner Katie Wilson Mould at St. Michael‚Äôs and All Angels Church in Gloucestershire. In May 2019 Henson became the landlord of The Fox and Hounds in St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Jovanoviƒá along with fellow student ƒåedomir Antiƒá were one of the founding members of the \\"Student Political Club\\", abbreviated in Serbian as SPK, which successfully organized a massive boycott of the 1997 Serbian general election. In February 1998, the bulk of the SPK membership along with Jovanoviƒá himself joined the Democratic Party. After the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Jovanoviƒá was selected by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia to be one of its MPs, and he subsequently became the youngest parliamentary caucus leader in Serbian history, at the age of 29. In the post-Milo≈°eviƒá period, he was a target of several assassination attempts and attacks. On February 6, 2001, an explosive device destroyed Jovanoviƒá's automobile. On March 31, 2001, he was left unscathed from a minor shooting incident at the scene of Milo≈°eviƒá's arrest, during which he was a negotiator. In July 2002, Minister of Interior Du≈°an Mihajloviƒá commented that \\"Jovanoviƒá was on all the hit lists\\" of \\"centers of power\\". Jovanoviƒá was expelled from the Democratic Party in 2004 due to breaking party protocols. He subsequently founded his own political party in November 2005, called the Liberal Democratic Party. He was his party's candidate in Serbia's presidential elections in 2008 and 2012. Early life Jovanoviƒá was born in a middle-class family in Belgrade. His parents Jovica and Milena (n√©e Mr≈°iƒá) Jovanoviƒá were both economists by profession. As a boy, he grew up in the New Belgrade neighborhood and completed the Ivan Gunduliƒá Primary School with average grades. Afterwards, he started attending the Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium, but soon after transferred to the Third Economics High School, from which he eventually graduated. He then enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, but after only a week of classes, decided to quit. Jovanoviƒá served in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1992 in Gradi≈°ka during the Bosnian War. In one of his memoirs, ƒåedomir Antiƒá wrote that Jovanoviƒá was once proud of his military career in the Bosnian War, but that he experienced an ideological change about the war years later. Jovanoviƒá eventually started attending Belgrade's Arts University's Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU), enrolling in its dramaturgy program, from which he graduated in 1998 at the age of 27. He never actually worked in his chosen profession, writing only a couple of plays that were never staged or published. Activism Jovanoviƒá was one of the student leaders of student protests in Belgrade during the winter of 1996-1997. The leaders of the demonstrations mostly composed of the membership of the SPK, an abbreviation for the Serbian Political Club. During the three months of demonstrations, Jovanoviƒá, ƒåedomir Antiƒá, and other SPK members were unwittingly followed and tracked by the State Security Service. Throughout the winter of 1996-1997, violent clashes with the state police and military occurred on multiple occasions. As a result of the clashes Jovanoviƒá was one of five representatives of the protest movement which met with General Momƒçilo Peri≈°iƒá and Internal Affairs Minister Zoran Sokoloviƒá. General Peri≈°iƒá told Jovanoviƒá that both the military and students \\"are above politics\\", and claimed to sympathize with the protest movement. However, the meeting with Minister Sokoloviƒá was far more tense, as Sokoloviƒá largely stonewalled Jovanoviƒá on the question of a protester named Predrag Starƒçeviƒá, who was killed on December 24, 1996. After the protests died out in early 1997, Jovanoviƒá intended on quitting political activity for good. However, in a series of SPK meetings, Jovanoviƒá and ƒåedomir Antiƒá debated on the future of the SPK, with Jovanoviƒá arguing that the SPK should join the Democratic Party. Antiƒá eventually agreed, however the SPK virtually ceased to exist as a result, with many members dropping out when SPK joined the Democratic Party. Three SPK members ended up joining the Democratic Party of Serbia, which years later would be involved in an intense schism with the rest of the DOS coalition. Political career=Democratic Opposition of Serbia He was elected to the Serbian Parliament in the December 23, 2000, parliamentary elections, on the list of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), and also held the post of DOS' parliamentary caucus leader until 2003. At only 29, he was the youngest person ever in Serbian politics to hold such a position. =Car bombing= On the morning of February 6, 2001, Jovanoviƒá sat in a restaurant by the business club \\"Lutra\\" to attend a discussion with State Security executive Franko Simatoviƒá, the Minister of Interior Du≈°an Mihajloviƒá, and Milorad Ulemek, who organized the meeting. Jovanoviƒá and Mihajloviƒá asked Simatoviƒá about the Ibar Highway assassination attempt on Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá, the murder of Slavko ƒÜuruvija and the disappearance of Ivan Stamboliƒá. Simatoviƒá claimed not to know about any of the liquidations, to which Jovanoviƒá remarked, \\"Frenki, you know so little for someone who was second man in the State Security Service.\\" After the meeting, Jovanoviƒá got in his Mitsubishi Pajero to drive his wife to Avalska street in Belgrade. After having walked approximately ten meters away from his vehicle, the Pajero exploded, destroying several other cars in the vicinity. Approximately 30 minutes had elapsed from the meeting with Simatoviƒá and the car bomb detonation. The vehicle was left in a parking lot for four days, after which it was taken for investigation by the Yugoslav Institute for Safety. Mitsubishi's European division also investigated and concluded that the cause of the explosion was that of a time bomb. The former head of the Yugoslav State Security Service, Jovica Stani≈°iƒá, later commented that \\"someone from our agency did it\\". =Negotiation of Milo≈°eviƒá's arrest= On March 31, 2001, after a masked government unit stormed Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's fortified villa, Jovanoviƒá negotiated with the former Yugoslav president for him to surrender peacefully. In an interview conducted by Ekspres in June 2016, Jovanoviƒá said that as Milo≈°eviƒá surrendered himself to the police, his daughter Marija asked him explicitly to commit suicide instead of surrendering. When Milo≈°eviƒá gave himself up to the authorities, Jovanoviƒá was removed by security after which Marija fired a pistol at the vehicle Jovanoviƒá was sitting in. In the same interview, Jovanoviƒá admitted that he feared more that Marija would get shot by the bodyguards than he did for his own life during the Milo≈°eviƒá villa standoff. In 2014, Jovanoviƒá appeared on a televised episode of \\"Goli ≈æivot\\" (\\"Naked life\\" in English) on TV Happy, during which he talked about some of his life experiences. In the interview, Jovanoviƒá talked about Milo≈°eviƒá and his arrest: =Incidents with the Zemun Clan and JSO= In March 2003, following the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, Jovanoviƒá advanced to the position of Deputy Prime Minister in the government of the new PM Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá. It has been alleged that during his mandate as Member of Parliament, in addition to his regular duties, Jovanoviƒá assumed the role of Prime Minister ƒêinƒëiƒá's government liaison - dealing with, and meeting individuals connected to Serbian organized crime circles. When the press got a hold of this information, a storm of controversy was created by raising many questions about Jovanovic's role in Government's dealing with the mafia. Political opponents directly accused him of criminal involvement and of providing favours for shady individuals such as Du≈°an Spasojeviƒá (late leader of the Zemun mafia clan) and Milorad Ulemek (now convicted as the person who organized the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá). Various rumours, mostly carried and exploited by daily tabloids, included even those that he is using heavy drugs. After continuous pressure from the media, Jovanoviƒá admitted to attending some meetings, but denied any wrongdoing, claiming that these contacts were made on behalf of the government in order to curb mafia activities and to secure political stability from the individuals left over from the Milo≈°eviƒá's era. During one of his speeches, he stated: \\"my hands are dirty, but my conscience is clear (because I was cleaning up Serbia)\\". The electorate did not exactly see it that way and Jovanoviƒá's popularity dropped drastically as a result of this episode. Realizing this, the Democratic Party brass marginalized his role within its ranks before the parliamentary elections in December 2003 by not even entering his name on the party's electoral ballot. He did not complain, at least not publicly, opting to instead focus on the coming party congress in February 2004 that was to determine its new post-ƒêinƒëiƒá leadership. Jovanoviƒá was hoping to get a seat on the main board, but did not receive enough delegate support. Split with the Democratic Party Dissatisfied with the party's new direction under the leadership of Boris Tadiƒá, Jovanoviƒá criticized him publicly, most notably for his policy of political cohabitation with Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica's government. Being a fierce Ko≈°tunica opponent, Jovanoviƒá felt that the Democratic Party should actively seek ways to bring down his government, especially when Boris Tadiƒá was elected President of the Republic in June 2004. A couple of months after Tadiƒá's inauguration, Jovanoviƒá wrote his party colleague an open public letter cedajovanovic.com on a per tu basis criticizing his political choices. Tadiƒá never even acknowledged the letter publicly until he was directly asked about it during an interview on a weekly political TV talk show Utisak nedelje. He admitted that he had not really bothered to read it and added: \\"When someone writes a letter, supposedly to me, by first making sure it gets published in the papers, then that's really not a letter but a political bid\\".Svi predsednikovi utisci, Utisak nedelje, B92, October 10, 2004 After his unsuccessful attempt to take over the DS leadership, Jovanoviƒá formed the \\"Liberal Democratic faction\\" within DS - knowingly breaching the party statute. The act was obviously not welcomed by the leadership and he was eventually expelled on December 3, 2004. In the following period, Jovanoviƒá's political activity became distinctly more direct. He gave bombastic interviews and in his strongly worded press releases frequently went after PM Ko≈°tunica's government officials, Ko≈°tunica himself, and the Serbian security apparatus. He repeatedly criticized the Serbian Orthodox Church, calling it dishonest, backward and dogmatic, protesting what he sees to be its interference in the country's politics. Parallel to all of this Jovanoviƒá also founded a non-governmental organization called Center for Modern Politics (Centar za modernu politiku, CMP), but its activities were sporadic at best and it eventually folded. In July 2005, Jovanoviƒá published a book, Moj sukob sa pro≈°lo≈°ƒáu (\\"My Confrontation with the Past\\"). He came out in favor of Kosovo's independence, thus becoming the only notable Serbian political party leader to do so and because of that he gained sympathies from many Albanians. Founding of the Liberal Democratic Party On November 5, 2005, Jovanoviƒá and his supporters founded the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to much fanfare, and Jovanoviƒá was elected as its first president at the age of 34. Soon after, in December, he was the subject of a lengthy, very affirmative piece penned by Zoran ƒÜirjakoviƒá in the influential American weekly magazine Newsweek,Now What? Dayton 10 Years Later.;Newsweek, 5 December 2005Now What? Dayton 10 Years Later.Newsweek, 5 December 2005 which, among other things, Jovanoviƒá used to further reiterate his stance on Kosovo and to declare his opinion that Bosnian Serb ties with Belgrade should effectively be severed. The first parliamentary elections Jovanoviƒá led his party in were held in January 2007. LDP's electoral list also featured several minority parties and Nenad ƒåanak's League of Vojvodina's Socialdemocrats (LSV). With an aggressive \\"Od nas zavisi\\" campaign, he was hoping to ensure enough votes for LDP to become a significant factor when it comes to forming the ruling coalition. However, LDP received about 5-6% of the total vote, barely clearing the 5% threshold required to enter the parliament. =November 2007 Mi≈°koviƒá affair= In November 2007, in anticipation of presidential election, Jovanoviƒá opened a public row with powerful and politically connected Serbian tycoon Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá. On Sunday, 18 November 2007, while guest on Utisak nedelje, a weekly television political talk-show, Jovanoviƒá claimed Mi≈°koviƒá tried to get himself off the US entry visa blacklist, in exchange offering the American embassy in Belgrade to arrange prime minister Ko≈°tunica's cooperative and soft stance when it comes to the final status of the Serbian province of Kosovo whose independence America firmly supported.Utisak nedelje; B92, 18 November 2007 Amid the controversy that was immediately raised, the next day, Monday, Jovanoviƒá went on B92 radio's morning talk-show Ka≈æiprst, claiming that Mi≈°koviƒá's liaison in this particular endeavour with the Americans was a well-known Belgrade journalist, stopping short of revealing his name.Ameriƒçke veze: Nepristojna ponuda; Vreme, 29 November 2007 However, later that day, talking in the Serbian parliament, Jovanoviƒá revealed the journalist to be Bratislav \\"Braca\\" Grubaƒçiƒá. Mi≈°koviƒá responded late in the day with a strongly worded press release, directly addressing Jovanoviƒá on a per tu basis, accusing him of being involved in Mi≈°koviƒá's eighteen-hour kidnapping in 2001 and of pocketing DM5 million from the ransom payment.Mi≈°koviƒá optu≈æio Jovanoviƒáa;B92, 19 November 2007 Jovanoviƒá responded by filing an official complaint against Mi≈°koviƒá in the Serbian police and publicly releasing a 4-page supposed internal Belgrade's American embassy document dated May 2007 in support of his earlier statements. The document was posted on Blic and B92 web sites.Tu≈æila≈°tvo mora da pokrene istragu; Blic, 22 November 2007 The US embassy in Belgrade, at the time headed by ambassador Cameron Munter, denied Jovanoviƒá's claims as well as the authenticity of the document Jovanoviƒá forwarded to the Serbian media.Ambasada SAD: ƒåeda la≈æe!; Vecernje novosti, 20 November 2007Optu≈æbe Jovanoviƒá-Mi≈°koviƒá-Grubaƒçiƒá; B92, 20 November 2007 Years later in 2011, amid the WikiLeaks affair, and the revelation of US diplomatic cables, a particular cable written by Munter from the Belgrade embassy claimed that Jovanoviƒá used a forged document in his accusations against Mi≈°koviƒá.ƒåEDA NAPAO MI≈†KOVIƒÜA FALSIFIKOVANIM DOKUMENTOM!;Kurir, 29 August 2011Kako nas je Manter proƒçitao; Vreme, 15 September 2011 2008 presidential campaign Jovanoviƒá was a candidate in the 2008 Serbian Presidential elections held in January.B92 News He was running under the slogan \\"≈Ωivot je zakon!\\" (eng. \\"Life Rules\\") while emphasizing his determination to bring down every person inside or outside the Serbian government who \\"oppose the idea of providing a better life for the people of Serbia\\". Once again, Jovanoviƒá has directly accused Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá, a Serbian tycoon, of being one of the most responsible persons for the underdevelopment of Serbia in the recent years.Official website of LDP He finished fifth with 5.34% of the total votes, well behind Boris Tadiƒá and Tomislav Nikoliƒá who went into the second round runoff. Ahead of the second round vote, despite expectations from some circles, Jovanoviƒá decided not to throw his support behind Tadiƒá, opting instead to stay neutral. Tadiƒá ended up winning the election regardless. 2012 presidential campaign For the second presidential election in a row, Jovanoviƒá was a candidate in the 2012 presidential elections in Serbia, held in May that year. His campaign included an internationally televised debate with Republika Srpska president Milorad Dodik. In the debate, Jovanoviƒá defended a previous statement he made saying that \\"Republika Srpska was founded on genocide and ethnic cleansing\\", referring particularly to the Srebrenica massacre. The debate exceeded its allotted time on television as the moderator failed to control the dialogue. Jovanoviƒá finished in sixth overall in the 2012 presidential election, recording 5.03% of the national vote.

Jovanoviƒá said \\"instead of going to the cannibals in Africa, he should react to the plight of the civilians in Libya.\\" The Algerian Ambassador to Serbia, Abdelkader Mesdoua, subsequently issued a statement to Vuk Jeremiƒá, saying that Jovanoviƒá's statements were racist and that he should apologize in the National Assembly of Serbia.

Its members are concerned with creating a better future for children through libraries. ALSC's membership is composed of more than 4,000 members, including children's and youth librarians, children's literature experts, publishers, education and library school faculty members, and other adults dedicated to library services for youth. ALSC has nearly 60 active committees and task forces carrying out the work of the Association, including developing programs for youth and continuing education; publishing resources and journals for youth librarians; and evaluating and awarding media for children. ALSC sets a standard for library service to children through the regular updating of Competencies for Librarians Serving Children in Public Libraries. The most recent competencies, adopted in 2015, emphasize seven core areas of competency that include services, programs, outreach, collection development, and administrative practices that contribute to quality library service for youth. Major Initiatives The Association of Library Service to Children supports five major initiatives focused on continuing education for children's librarians; enhanced library services and programming for children aged 0‚Äì14 years; and collaboration with other agencies serving youth. El D√≠a de los Ni√±os/El D√≠a de los Libros (Children's Day/Book Day)  El d√≠a de los ni√±os/El d√≠a de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day), commonly known as D√≠a or Diversity in Action, is an ongoing celebration of children, families, and reading that culminates yearly on April 30. D√≠a was created by author/illustrator Pat Mora in collaboration with REFORMA. Babies Need Words Every Day As part of their commitment to bridging the 30 million word gap, ALSC created colorful posters and booklists designed to be hung in accessible public spaces, such as bathroom changing tables and on buses, to inform parents of ways to read, talk, sing, and play with their babies. Posters are available to print for free in both English and Spanish. Every Child Ready to Read¬Æ @ your bitcoin¬Æ Every Child Ready to Read¬Æ @ your bitcoin¬Æ, commonly abbreviated as ECRR, is a parent education program designed by ALSC and the Public Library Association. The initiative focuses on the development of early literacy skills in children ages 0‚Äì5. Many storytimes and other early childhood programs in libraries across the world incorporate research and practices from ECRR. The ECRR toolkit is designed to help librarians teach parents that early literacy begins at home and is taught by parents. The toolkit was revised in 2011. Media mentorship In 2015, the ALSC Board accepted a white paper titled \\"Media Mentorship in Libraries Serving Youth.\\" This paper outlines the role of librarians and other library staff who serve youth and families with particular regard to materials and practices surrounding digital media. Everyday Advocacy In recognition that libraries must advocate for their patrons and themselves within their communities, Everyday Advocacy provides resources and training materials to empower library workers to take action in a grassroots effort to build awareness of and support for the library. ALSC continually advocates for the support and enhancement of library services to children and those who provide it by encouraging practitioners to speak out within their communities to promote the value of those services. The division also partners with other agencies that serve children to spread the word about the power of reading, early literacy, and youth services.

Most of his works deal with the lifestyle, tragedy and struggle of the village people and the contemporary social practices that prevailed in Bengal. He remains the most popular, translated, adapted, and plagiarized Indian author of all time.  Biography  Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay was born on 15 September 1876, in Debanandapur, a small village in Hooghly, West Bengal. Birthplace of Sarat Chandra in Debanandapur, Hooghly Sarat Chandra was a daring, adventure-loving boy. His education began at Pyari Pandit's pathshala, an informal village school and later he joined Hooghly Branch High School. He was a good student and got a double promotion that enabled him to skip a grade. He passed his Entrance Examination (public examination at the end of Class X) but could not take his F.A. (First Arts) examination or attend college due to lack of funds. House of Chattopadhyay After returning from Burma, Chattopadhyay stayed for 11 years in Baje Shibpur, Howrah. Then he made a house in the village of Samta, in 1923, where he spent the later twelve years of his life as a novelist. His house is known as Sarat Chandra Kuthi. The two-storied Burmese style house was also home to Sarat Chandra's brother, Swami Vedananda, who was a disciple at Belur Math. His and his brother's samadhi are within the house's compound. Trees like bamboo and guava planted by the renowned author still stand tall in the gardens of the house.House of Sarat Chandra Appreciation The phenomenal popularity of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay has been attested by some of the most prominent writers as well as literary critics across India in their writings. Most of the authors in Assam and Odisha, at least before the Independence, read him admiringly in original Bengali; rest of India read him in translations in varying quality. Publishers were never tired of reprinting his works; he remains the most translated, the most adapted and the most plagiarized author. His novels also reached a number of people through the medium of film and he is still an important force in Indian cinema. O. N. V. Kurup writes \\"...Sarat Chandra's name is cherished as dearly as the names of eminent Malayalam novelists. His name has been a household word\\". Dr Mirajkar informs \\"the translations of Sarat Chandra created a stir amongst the readers and writers all over Maharashtra. He has become a known literary personality in Maharashtra in the rank of any popular Marathi writers including H. N. Apte, V. S. Khandekar, N. S. Phadke and G. T. Madkholkar\\". Jainendra Kumar, who considers that his contribution towards the creation and preservation of cultural India is second, perhaps, only to that of Gandhi, asks a rhetorical question summing up Sarat Chandra's position and presumably the role of translation and inter-literary relationship: \\"Sarat Chandra was a writer in Bengali; but where is that Indian language in which he did not become the most popular when he reached it?\\" Films His works have been made into around fifty films in many Indian languages. Particularly, his novel Devdas has been made into sixteen versions, from Bengali, Hindi to Telugu. Parineeta has also been made twice. In 1957 Bardidi was made by director Ajoy Kar. Rajlakshmi O Srikanta and Indranath Srikanta O Annadadidi by Haridas Bhattacharya in 1958 and 1959 respectively, Majhli Didi (1967) by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Swami (1977), for which he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Story, are other adaptations. Another famous film Chhoti Bahu (1971) is based on his novel Bindur Chhele. His novel 'Datta' was adapted into a Bengali film as Datta (film) in 1951 directed by Saumyen Mukhopadhyay starring Sunanda Banerjee and Manoranjan Bhattacharyya in the lead roles with Ahindra Choudhury as Rashbehari,YouTubeMoviebuff and again in 1976 starring Suchitra Sen and Soumitra Chatterjee in the lead roles. The film Sabyasachi (film) was released in 1977 based on his work Pather Dabi. The other movies based on his novel were Nishkriti, and Apne Paraye (1980) by Basu Chatterjee, starring Amol Palekar. The Telugu film Thodi Kodallu (1957) is also based on this novel. Gulzar's 1975 film, Khushboo is majorly inspired by his work Pandit Mashay. The 1961 Telugu film Vagdanam by Acharya Atreya is loosely based on his novel Datta. Also the 2011 film Aalo Chhaya is based on his short story, Aalo O Chhaya.  Bibliography  Sarat Chandra wrote novels, novellas, and stories. His first novel was Badadidi (1907), which was published in the Bharati and made him well known. He went on to write several stories and novels, including *Bindur Chhele O Anyanya (1914) *Parinita (1916) *Baikunther Will (1916) *Pallisamaj (1916) *Devdas (1917) *Charitrahin (1917) *Nishkrti (1917) *Shrikanta (Part 1‚Äì4, 1917‚Äì1933) *Datta (1918) *Grihadaha (1920) *Dena-Paona (1923) *Pather Dabi (1926) *Shes Prashna (1931) He also wrote essays, which were anthologized in Narir Mulya (1923) and Svadesh O Sahitya (1932). Shrikanta, Charitrahin, Devdas, Grihadaha, Dena-Paona and Pather Dabi are among his most popular works. Pather Dabi was banned by the British Government because of its revolutionary theme. His posthumous publications include Chhelebelar Galpa, Shubhada (1938), Sheser Parichay (1939), Sharat Chandrer Granthabali (1948) and Sharat Chandrer Aprakashita Rachanabali (1951). He wrote some essays including Narir Itihas (The History of Women) and Narir Mulya (The Value of Women). Narir Itihas, which was lost in a house fire, contained a history of women on the lines of Spencer's Descriptive Sociology. While the second, Narir Mulya gives a theory of women's rights in the context of Mill's and Spencer's arguments.

It is named after Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, a Serb poet. It was founded in 1810 by a donation of a wealthy merchant from Novi Sad. The school was rebuilt in the 20th century, using the donations of baron Milo≈° Bajiƒá who gave 20,000 forints. History \\"Sava Vukoviƒá\\" portrait, Novi Sad, Museum of Vojvodina. Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj High School in Novi Sad is one of the oldest cultural and educational institutions in Serbia. Through its three-century long existence it has become a proud treasurer of memories of educational development in this country. At the beginning of the nineteenth century while Napoleon's cannons were changing the political map of Europe, and Karadjordje's rebels were fighting for Serbian independence, a prominent merchant from Novi Sad, Sava Vukoviƒá of Beregsova, was thinking of leaving something permanent to remind his people of himself. On St. Sava's Day 1810, blind and seriously ill, Vukoviƒá donated 20 000 forints for foundation of a Serbian grammar school in Novi Sad. However the story of secondary education in Novi Sad does not start with this generous gesture. Back in 1731, at the same spot where the modern building of the school stands, the bishop of Baƒçka Visaion Pavloviƒá founded a school whose name was ‚ÄúLatino-Slavic Nativity of the Mother of God School‚Äù. Bishop Pavloviƒá and the council of the Serbian Orthodox Church were deeply aware of the fact that only a good education in Latin can provide better future for Serbian people in Habsburg Monarchy. Among the best-known students of this school there were Joakim Vujiƒá and Lukijan Mu≈°icki, and the best-known teacher was Zaharije Orfelin. This school continued its work till 1789 when the Serbs from Novi Sad led by promises and reforms of the emperor Joseph II abolished this educational institution in order to make a grammar school for all religions in Novi Sad. For this noble purpose they gave the building and the whole inventory of the school. A fast crash of Joseph's reforms, showed all the haste and imprudence of this gesture, since instead of the state grammar school for all religions in the orthodox part of Novi Sad, a Roman Catholic school was founded. Because of that Metropolitan Bishop of Karlovci Stefan Stratimiroviƒá, Bishop of Baƒçka Gedeon Petroviƒá and the council of the Orthodox Church in Novi Sad had a great wish to reopen Serbian Orthodox Grammar School beside the Roman Catholic one. It was not by chance that Novi Sad became the stage of this historical event. With more than 20 000 inhabitants, hundreds of small shops and well-developed wheat merchandise, Novi Sad was the economical and cultural Serbian centre in Habsburg Monarchy. In the inaugural letter of Sava Vukoviƒá, three basic tasks which the school should fulfill were stated: general education and upbringing in national spirit through the Eastern Orthodox religion and national language. A great number of people from Novi Sad joined this noble act encouraged by Bishop of Baƒçka Gedeon Petroviƒá and Metropolitan Bishop of Karlovci Stefan Stratimiroviƒá, and in this way more than 100,000 forints were collected which was enough for the foundation of school. Lack of higher education institutions forced Serbian youth in Habsburg Monarchy to continue their education in Roman Catholic or Protestant schools which had in itself a fear of distancing them from Serbian religion and nation. Habsburg emperor Frantz I gave his consent for the foundation of the school on December 11, 1811. However, not everything was finished with this emperor's agreement, only on January 31, 1816 the foundation act was confirmed and the conditions for opening the first and second grade, and in November the third grade of the grammar school were made. Based on the emperor's decision and in accordance with the Foundation Act, Patronage and Board of Trustees were formed as the primary administrative bodies of the school, and they managed the school until 1920. According to the Foundation Act the school was a property of Serbian Orthodox Church in Novi Sad, and the Patronage administrated the school instead of it. At the head of the Patronage there were Metropolitan Bishop of Karlovci and Bishop of Novi Sad; two members were from Backa consistorium, and four from Orthodox Church Council in Novi Sad. The Patronage made decisions about the curriculum and the books which were used. It also chose principals and teachers, and regulated their salaries and awards. In act 7 of the Foundation Act the Board of Trustees was formed and its task was to invest the capital of the school and secures its continuous finances. The Board had six members, mainly rich merchants, craftsmen and lawyers. The flag of the school was established in 1816. On one side there was Lord Jesus Christ, and on the other Saint Sava. This flag has been preserved till today. With the arrival of the teachers Georgije Magara≈°eviƒá, Mojsije Petroviƒá, Ignjat Jovanoviƒá and Pavel Jozef ≈†afarik the number of the classes was increased to six, and at the beginning of October 1819 the Serbian Orthodox's Great Grammar School in Novi Sad became a complete grammar school. Serbian Orthodox Gymnasium, Novi Sad, 1889. The first school building was next to the Orthodox Cathedral Church, at the spot of today's Platoneum. It was built by the council of Serbian Orthodox Church in 1788 for the needs of Latino-Slavic Nativity of the Mother of God School. With its beauty it attracted everyone who came to Novi Sad. ≈†afarik said about it:‚ÄùThe building of the school is something unique; I have never seen anything like that‚Äù. The first principals of the grammar school were a priest Danilo Petroviƒá and the mayor Grigorije Jankoviƒá. With the increased number of students and classes the Patronage took steps to insure the emperor's accreditation for the school. This meant that all graduated students of the school had the right to enroll any academy, lycee and university in Habsburg Monarchy without taking entrance or differential examinations. This accreditation was given to the school by Frantz I on October 26, 1818. The curriculum was made in accordance with the state regulation ‚ÄúRatio educationis‚Äù which was applied to all state schools in Hungary. The grammar school had six classes until 1848, and all the subjects were taught in German, apart from religious lessons which were taught in Serbian. The following subjects were taught in the grammar school: the basis of Latin and German, Geography, Anthropology and Arithmetic, Latin with syntax, Religious Lessons, Nature Studies and Anthropology, World's History, Archeology, Physics, Logics, Rhetoric, Poetry and Ethics. The school flourished when a literary historian and a famous scientist Pavel Jozef ≈†afarik came to its head. In the period of 1816 to 1848 the school had seven principals, and the classes were taught by twenty-seven teachers. The best known among them were Milovan Vidakoviƒá, Pavel Jozef ≈†afarik, Georgije Magaraseviƒá i Jovan Had≈æiƒá. Collecting books in order to make a school library started on ≈†afarik's great insistence in 1819. Ceremonial opening of the library was in 1822 and until 1849 it had about 1600 books. Because of the importance of religious lessons, classes of church singing were held from the very beginning of the school. The first choir was founded in 1828. A first school of music was opened in the Great Serbian Orthodox Grammar School in 1841 and it was led by a conductor, composer and singer Aleksandar Morfidids-Nisis. It is thought that in period between 1816 and 1848 more than 3 300 students attended the school which had enormous impact on intelligence and national rebirth of Serbs. The grammar school continued its work up to great revolutionary events of 1848. On June 12, 1849 there was a disastrous bombing of Novi Sad from the Petrovaradin fortress. 2004 of 2812 buildings in the town were burnt down. Among them there was the grammar school building. Beside the building all the didactical equipment and valuable collection for nature study were destroyed. The attempt to save the library was not successful because the books were moved to Alma≈°ka Temple (The Church of Three Holy Hierarchs) which was also burnt down. Terrible war raging caused the school to continue its work only in October 1852. Greatly impoverished the council on the Serbian Orthodox Church collected enough money to enable it happen with enormous effort. It was reopened as an incomplete four-class grammar school which was not accredited. The curriculum at that time included the following subjects: History with Geography, Religious Lessons, Latin, Greek, German, Serbian and Arithmetic. The administration of four-class grammar school was a great load for the Patronage and the council of the Orthodox Church in Novi Sad. The help unexpectedly came from Vienna from the emperor Frantz Joseph personally. It came to Novi Sad on September 27, 1860 and included an offer to finance the school from the state funds and enable it to become a complete eight-class school, but on condition that it preserved its religious and national character. The offer was gladly accepted, but five years had passed before Hungarian regency council informed the Patronage that it was ordered by emperor's resolution to raise the school in Novi Sad to the level of a great grammar school with eight classes. The emperor Frantz Joseph accredited the school with the same resolution. At that time the school offered classical humanistic education, which was most evident in the number of classes dedicated to language studying. Back then, the following were the compulsory subjects: Latin, Religious Studies, Serbian, Hungarian, Geography, History, Natural Sciences, Physics, Geometrical Drawing, Philosophy and Calligraphy. The optional subjects included: French, Descriptive Geometry, Church Gospel Singing, Music and Singing (piano, violin, playing in orchestra and tambourine orchestra). In 1854 Dr. ƒêorƒëe Nato≈°eviƒá, the then principal introduced gymnastics as a compulsory subject and equipped the school with several gymnastic devices. Until the new building for the school was erected, gymnastics classes had been run outside during summer. The school's library continued its work only in 1865, when the Orthodox Church Municipality of Novi Sad assumed the responsibility to regularly finance its work. Invaluably important sources for the study of the school's history are the yearbooks that have been published since 1867. In the school year of 1867/1868 the first GCSE exams were held in the school. Out of eleven candidates who applied to take the exams, one passed with a grade ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù while others got the grade ‚Äúmature‚Äù. This event was of great importance since it was the first time that GCSE exams were organized in the Serbian education. Despite many hardships of war, ever since then the school has managed to organize the GCSE exams every year and hold the leading position in our educational system. As it was decided by the Patriarch Josif Rajaƒçiƒá, all the Serbian schools in the Monarchy accepted Saint Sava as the patron saint of Serb schools and schoolchildren. On that day all the students along with their teachers attended a holy liturgy in the Orthodox Cathedral. The celebration continued in the premises of the school where the special bread-like cake was broken by all in attendance (Slavski Kolaƒç) and the official performance took place in the honour of the celebration. The political separation of that time that was taking place among the Serbian people affected the school, as well. It found itself in the middle of a conflict between the conservative clergy that governed the school's work via the Patronage on the one hand, and the Liberal party led by Svetozar Miletiƒá that tried to take over the running of the school, on the other. In the period between August 15 and 18, 1866 the premises of the school were used as the whereabouts of the Foundation Assembly of The United Serbian Youth, the romantic revolutionary organization which fought for liberation and unification of the Serbian people. Not uncommon were the conflicts between the Patronage and certain teachers and students, which largely diminished the reputation of the school After The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 there ensued the period of great changes in the school's work. Conditioning the state subventions the then Hungarian authorities made an attempt to implement the assimilation policy with respect to the school. In the school year of 1870/71 the Hungarian Assembly approved the funds of 8000 forint to help the school, provided that the Ministry of Education had the right to choose the curriculum and the teachers. The Patronage refused this subsidy claiming that it was in contradiction with the School Foundation Act. The school was successfully run during this period by Vasa Pu≈°ibrk (who was the school's principal from 1871 till 1910). After the Basic Secondary Education Act was implemented in 1883, even greater challenges ensued regarding the preservation of the school's inner autonomy. Since then the Patronage was under direct supervision of the representatives of the Hungarian government, who carried out inspection twice a year and observed the advanced bankruptcy exam. According to the Secondary Education Act from 1883 the school management was obliged to considerably adjust the work and organization to the state schools, which required even higher subsidies.

Consecration of the new building of the Serbian Orthodox Gymnasium, Novi Sad, 1901. Apart from the school's fund, the school lived off school's activities and endowments and donations of many of national benefactors. With respect to this, the following should be mentioned: the endowment of Atanasije Gereski, the so-called Atanaseum, Dr. Nikola Krstiƒá from Belgrade, Gedeon Dunƒëerski, the couple Pajeviƒá from Novi Sad, Teodor and Persida Mandiƒá, Luka Milanoviƒá, Marija Petroviƒá, Vasa Jovanoviƒá ƒåiƒça, the endowment of ƒêorƒëe Servijski and many others. During the 1870s the school's premises were no longer sufficient for the school's needs. The Board for Collecting Donations for the extension of the school's premises started with the work in 1897. During this activity, Baron Milo≈° Bajiƒá (the grandson of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá) donated 200 000 krones for the construction. The new building was constructed in the Renaissance style where the old one had stood according to the design by Vladimir Nikoliƒá. The construction started on September 22, 1899 and finished on July 1, 1900. According to the 1899/1900 curriculum, the compulsory subjects were: Religious Sciences, Latin, Greek, Hungarian, German, Serbian, Geography, History, Natural Sciences, Physics, Mathematics, Geometrical Drawing, Philosophy and Calligraphy, while the optional subjects included: French, Shorthand, Instrument Playing (the violin, piano, tambourine, fencing, Octoechos and Religious Science for the Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jews). The activity of the students was particularly evident in starting numerous student newspapers. In the 19th century these included: ‚ÄúSloga‚Äù, ‚Äú ƒêaƒçki Venac ‚Äù, ‚Äú Zolja ‚Äù, ‚Äúƒêaƒçka Matica‚Äù. In the beginning of the 20th century these were: ‚ÄúSova‚Äù, ‚ÄúGusle‚Äù, ‚Äú≈†esto≈°kolac‚Äù, ‚ÄúBiƒç‚Äù, ‚ÄúOsvitak‚Äù, ‚ÄúNapredak‚Äù and ‚ÄúNovi ƒëaƒçki venac‚Äù. The school had 15,792 students enrolled in the period between 1868 and 1918. The first high school girls were enrolled in the school during the school year of 1894/1895. Most of the students were of the Serbian nationality, but there were also Germans, Jews, Croats, Hungarians, Slovaks, Romanians and Ruthenians, which speaks best about the teaching quality in the school. Unlike in other grammar schools in Hungary, the Patronage decided to set the same school fee for all the students irrespective of their religious orientation and to approve the fee exemption for the students who‚Äôd deserve it by their hard work. Throughout the entire 19th century the school was a real center of intellectual activity. Either as students or as teachers the following great people took part in the school's activity: Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Laza Kostiƒá, Jovan Turoman, ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, Ilaja Ognjanoviƒá-Abukazem, Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin, Jovan Grƒçiƒá-Milenko, Paja Markoviƒá-Adamov, Milan Saviƒá, Svetozar Miletiƒá, Mihailo Polit-Desanƒçiƒá, Tihomir Ostojiƒá, Isidor Bajiƒá, Stanije Stanojeviƒá, Jovan Radoniƒá, Radovan Ko≈°utiƒá, Milan ≈†eviƒá, Pavle Vujeviƒá, Aleksa Iviƒá, Radivoj Ka≈°anin, Radivoj Petroviƒá, Jovan Maksimoviƒá, Mileta Jak≈°iƒá, Miloje Milojeviƒá, Petar Konjoviƒá, and many others. Profoundly opposed interests of the great powers in 1914 will plunge mankind into World War I. Due to its vicinity to the battlefield the school's premises were taken over by the army in 1914 and in 1915 it was turned into a military hospital. The teaching staff was scarce on the account of mobilization and other war effects and in the school years 1914/1915 and 1915/1916 only the exams were organized in the school. During the school years 1916/1917 and 1917/1918 regular classes and teaching was carried out but with a lot of difficulties due to the lack of both teachers and money. Therefore, the school years were shortened and semester exams were introduced. After the war and huge changes, the school continued its work in the liberated and newly united Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The school year 1919/1920 started with no significant innovations. The school was still run by the Patronage until August 27, 1920, when the Ministry of Education of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes made a decision that would bring the school into the state's possession and give it the name the State Grammar School for Boys in Novi Sad. As it was generally thought, there was no need for the school to continue its work as a private confessional school. This decision came at just the right time, since due to the war-ruined economy, inflation and agrarian reform (by which 353 kJ of land property i.e. the entire land property was taken from the school) the Patronage could no longer cope with economic hardships and finance the school's work on its own. This didn‚Äôt mean that the work of the Patronage was over, because it continued to manage the funds and property of the school. The Patronage carried on helping the school's development all until the communist authorities took away the property of the Orthodox Municipality of Novi Sad and funds of the Patronage by the Nationalization Act from December 5, 1946 and its Annex from April 28, 1948. By this act the rights of the Patronage over the school were abolished. The first and foremost task was renewal of the classrooms, library and school's inventory, since the school's premises were turned into a hospital during the war. The library was particularly damaged because 2/3 of the students‚Äô books and about 2500 of the books from the teachers‚Äô library were lost. For the second time in its history the library would arise from the ashes but not until 1927. The national freedom and newly created circumstances were most evident in the school curricula. In History classes the emphasis was put on studying the history of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, while the Serbian language and mathematics held the leading position by the number of their classes in week. As an expression of the general Francophilia, there came to the increase in the number of classes where French was taught and studied. Regarding the tradition and efforts made by certain teachers, German was taught pretty extensively. There was a strong rivalry between the German and French teachers. On the 3 October the school changed its name into The State Male Practical High School of King Aleksandar I. In the period between 1935 and 1937 a three-hectare sports ground for the classes of physical education was built (on the grounds of present-day FC ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù). Volleyball courts, basketball courts, football fields, tennis courts and gyms were built there. In 1914 the students of this school founded FC ‚ÄúVojvodina‚Äù and doing that they laid the foundation of the sports society which is today one of the biggest in Europe. In the new country the school developed a very vivid social activity. Lectures were held, students‚Äô meetings and activities were organized. The highest state officials visited it very often because the school was highly respected due to its fame in the past. When the High Schools of Novi Sad and Karlovci became state schools Serbian nation was left without the classical grammar school. The minister of education Anton Koro≈°ec tried to turn back the time when he gave the permission for the renewal of The Serbian Orthodox Novi Sad Grammar School in September 1939. The old grammar school became a subtenant in its own former building. In 1939 this school had one class and in 1940 the second one was opened. The attempt to renew the old grammar school was stopped by the outbreak of World War II. The dynamic development of The State Male Practical High School of King Aleksandar I was stopped by the April war 1941. The fast crash of the Yugoslav army was a terrible sign of the great suffering of the Serbian nation which followed. The fascist occupying forces entered Novi Sad on 13 April. The school's work was prohibited as it was an institution with an emphasized national significance. A new Hungarian Royal State School with Serbian as a teaching language was founded on the site of the old school. It had two parallel classes in each grade. The aim of this educational institution was to develop the sense of loyalty to Great Hungary and to make the preconditions for the process of hungarisation through the lessons of Hungarian language and history. The basic subject was Hungarian language and the classes were held in Serbian. The teachers had to speak Hungarian among themselves. Denationalization and hungarisation were obvious not only in the classes and extracurricular activities but also in the changes of some subjects. The study of national history was put out of the curriculum and the study of Hungarian history was introduced. During the war the school library was seriously destroyed. The aggressor decided that the school library can hold only the samples of the books printed before the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire i.e. before the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians. The patronage got 11,050 books to keep and over 20 000 disappeared. After World War II the books were given to the library of Matica Srpska to be kept there. During the difficult days of occupation the people were expelled and killed on a massive scale (the raid in Novi Sad in 1942) and all the suffering finished in October 1944. It is supposed that about 213 students and teachers of the school lost their lives during the war. Three high schools were founded in Novi Sad on 28 February 1945: Male (which was previously on the spot of Platoneum and was later moved to the building in Futoska Street), Mixed (on the spot of today's Music school) and Female (in the building of the previous Civil school). After Bulgarian army had moved out of the school's building, the Mixed School moved in on the 30 June 1945. In the school year 1950/51 Male school from Futo≈°ka Street was moved into the present-day building of the school and the uniform First Mixed High School was founded, and earlier high school became the Second Mixed High School. Next year, The First Mixed High School becomes Mixed School ‚ÄúSvetozar Markoviƒá‚Äù, and The Second Mixed High School got the name ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù. In order to use these schools‚Äô space in the best possible way they were united into the High School ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù in the school year 1959/60. After the liberation of the country, because of the large-scale poverty and the lack of basic didactic device, the classes were held with the great dedication of the teachers. The lack of course books and professional teaching staff as well as classes with the great number of students represented one more difficulty of that time. After World War II Yugoslavia happened to be in the Communist group so that the whole process of education was followed by the focus on the social- political education on the basis of Marxist study. Until the conflict with Inform biro in 1947 Yugoslav Government blindly copied USSR's social system, which had negative effects on the education-‚Äúthe reduction of criteria and leveling in work demands with higher elementary school children and secondary school children.‚Äù The church was severely criticized by the Communist regime so that religious education was put out of the curriculum for the first time since the school's foundation. The period from the end of the World War II until the decline of the SFRY has seen many reforms in the education. Novi Sad high school has been used by education authorities as an indicator of success of certain reforms, showing its reputation in the new socialist society. According to the General Education Act from 1958, the school had to give its students the profound knowledge in science and humanities and general- technical knowledge. The innovation was that teaching was divided into general and optional. General teaching involved: Serbo-Croatian and literature, history, sociology with the basics of political-economics, Yugoslav social system, logic and psychology, philosophy, art, foreign language (besides Russian which was dominant after the liberation, English, German and French were introduced), biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, crafts, physical education and premilitary training. Optional teaching was divided into four departments: humanities (social science and the second foreign language), natural sciences- first group (mathematics, chemistry, physics), natural sciences-second group (biology, physics, chemistry) and foreign language (second foreign language and Latin). The aim of this kind of teaching was to make a basis for further specialized training and to create a socialist point of view to the world. On the basis of this federal law, NR Serbia decided that the high schools in Serbia should be divided into two departments: humanities and science. After a great school reform initiated by Stipe ≈†uvar, from 1977 until 1983, the school worked as a Centre for the education of staff in social activities. In its printed report, High School ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù announced the following:‚Äù In accordance to the reform of secondary school education in the Socialist Autonomous province of Vojvodina, starting from the following school year this school will work under the name Centre for the education of staff in social activities ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù and will be teaching the future professionals in law, mathematics, IT, biology, physics, chemistry and geography.‚Äù Six years after this careless and unsuccessful reform it again became Secondary school for science ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù. Since the school year 1990/91 the school got the name High School ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá-Zmaj‚Äù. Today the official name is Grammar School ‚ÄúJovan Jovanoviƒá- Zmaj‚Äù. The decline of the country, economic and political isolation caused not only the reconsideration of the values in the society but also the crisis of educational system. Besides this, the school managed to preserve its reputation, especially with the opening of the special mathematical classes for gifted students. After the democratic changes on 5 October 2000, the development of the school went into two directions: not only did the school become the leader in introducing innovations and higher standards in secondary education but it also returned to its glorious tradition and past which this educational institution has. There are six departments at school today: natural sciences department, bilingual department, department for mathematically gifted students, department for gifted students in area of computers, department for gifted students in area of physics and general- sports department. Since 2007 there have been experimental classes of the last two primary school grades (7th and 8th grade). The first official class of 7th and 8th grade is class of 2001 (it officially started in 2016). The school is equipped with three modern IT study rooms and specialized rooms for mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology with the laboratories, school library with 30 000 books, stateroom and gym. There are extracurricular activities like choir and orchestra, French drama group, reciting group, eco club, debate club, editorial staff of the school newspaper ‚ÄúSkamija‚Äù (founded in 1972), linguistic workshop, psychology workshop, chemistry and biology workshop, art workshop and IT and robotics workshop. For years the cultural exchange of teachers and students has been realized with a High School from Slan√Ω (Czech Republic), and from this year the same form of exchange will start with the High School from Moscow called ‚ÄúElada‚Äù. In 2016, the gymnasium building was extensively renovated. Besides restoring damaged sections of the interior and exterior structure, the buildings main roof has been altered to accommodate a glass roof for the school museum in the style and place of the old main roof. The building changed its color from white to a vibrant beige color with lighter beige and white highlights in key areas of the masonry and relief.

Soviet stamp of 1980 year. The Yakovlev Yak-24 (NATO reporting name \\"Horse\\") is a Soviet twin-engine, tandem rotor, transport helicopter developed by Yakovlev in the 1950s. The Yak-24 saw limited use in the Soviet Air Force, and the exact number produced and duration of service are unknown due to inconsistencies in data. Design and development In September 1951, following a meeting of Joseph Stalin with senior aircraft designers the Soviet Union issued two design specifications for helicopters, with the intent of rapidly accelerating Soviet helicopter development. The requirement for a medium-sized helicopter which could transport 12 people was issued to the Mil Design Bureau, which would result in the Mil Mi-4, while the requirement for a larger helicopter capable of transporting 24 people was given to the Yakovlev Design Bureau under Alexander Yakovlev. Prototypes of both types had to be flying within a year - 'unlimited support' was to be provided for these two programmes by the national research institutes. Yakovlev made two prototypes for flight testing, and two more for static and dynamic ground tests. The first prototype was flown on 3 July 1952. It was powered with two 1,268 kW (1,700 hp) Shvetsov ASh-82V radial engines and was built in a tandem rotor layout, which was not typical for Soviet helicopters, which soon brought it the nickname Letayushchiy Vagon () ‚Äì 'the Flying Railroad Car'. The engines and transmission system were identical to the already-proven single-engine Mil Mi-4, but the Yak-24 proved to be less successful. Its engines were linked together so each could drive one or both rotors, but such an arrangement caused strong vibrations in the airframe. After the problems were partially solved, the new helicopter was ordered for production by the Soviet Air Force, which began in 1955 at Factory No. 272 in Leningrad. In July 1955, the Yak-24 was first presented to the public in Tushino, and on 17 December 1955 it set two new world payload records, lifting a 2,000 kg (4,409 lb) load to 5,082 m (16,673 ft) and 4,000 kg (8,818 lb) to 2,902 m (9,521 ft). The initial variant was the Yak-24 ‚Äì Army transport helicopter, that could carry up to 30 airborne troops, 18 stretchers or 3,000 kg (6,614 lb) of cargo. From 1958, the improved model Yak-24U was produced, with all-metal rotors of larger diameter (21 m/69 ft) and an all-metal fuselage. It could carry 40 soldiers or 3,500 kg (7,716 lb) of cargo, including two GAZ-69 jeeps or anti-tank guns. A civilian variant for 30 passengers was the Yak-24A, produced from 1960 in small numbers for Aeroflot. It was also used as a flying crane, lifting an external load of 5,000 kg (11,023 lb). There were two proposed models: the Yak-24K nine-seat VIP salon with a shorter fuselage and the civilian Yak-24P for 39 passengers with stronger 2,013 kW (2,700 hp) turboshaft engines, but neither reached production. Data on the Yak-24 is inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, the exact number of helicopters produced is unknown, with estimates ranging from 40 to 100 units depending on the source of the data. All sources agree that production of the Yak-24 was curtailed due to technical problems, and the need for a heavy transport helicopter was fulfilled by the successful Mil Mi-6, becoming its de facto replacement. According to some sources, the passenger Yak-24A for Aeroflot was not actually produced. The exact date of the Yak-24's decommissioning from the Soviet Air Force, and possibly Aeroflot, is unknown. A surviving Yak-24 is preserved at the Central Air Force Museum in Monino, Russia.

Formed in 2004, the group is centred around vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, who is the only constant member of the lineup. The band has been through many personnel changes since their formation, with the current incarnation including drummer Hamish Rosser and bassist Brad Heald, both of whom are former members of The Vines. The original ‚Äì and most commercially successful ‚Äì lineup included bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross and drummer Myles Heskett. Ross and Heskett left Wolfmother after four years in 2008. Stockdale, Ross and Heskett formed Wolfmother in 2004 after several years of informal jamming. Signing with independent label Modular Recordings, the band released their self-titled debut album in Australia in 2005, which reached number 3 on the domestic albums chart. It was released internationally by Interscope and Island Records the following year, and to date has sold in excess of 1.5 million copies worldwide. After Ross and Heskett departed, Stockdale rebuilt the band with the addition of bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, who released Cosmic Egg in 2009. In recent years, the lineup of Wolfmother has continued to change frequently, with their commercial popularity fluctuating. The band's planned third album Keep Moving was released as Stockdale's solo debut in 2013, with a new lineup including drummer Vin Steele issuing New Crown independently the following year. In 2016, the group released Victorious as their first album on a major label since Cosmic Egg, and subsequently toured with Alex Carapetis on drums. Wolfmother's personnel have continued to change, with Stockdale subsequently releasing and touring in promotion of his second solo album Slipstream in 2018. History=2004‚Äì08: Formation, early years and self-titled debut The genesis of Wolfmother began in 2000, when founding members Andrew Stockdale, Chris Ross, and Myles Heskett started jamming together, before officially forming the band in 2004. Prior to this, Stockdale was a photographer, Ross worked in digital media and Heskett worked as a graphic designer. Ross came up with the name of the band. The first live performance of the newly-christened Wolfmother took place on 14 April 2004 at Vic in the Park, a pub in Sydney. The group were signed by Australian independent label Modular Recordings in August 2004, with whom they released their self-titled debut extended play (EP) Wolfmother the following month. The EP reached number 35 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart. The band toured in promotion of the release for approximately six months, during which time they signed an international recording deal with the Universal Music Group. After producing a demo for Universal US imprint Interscope Records in Sydney, Wolfmother began recording their full-length debut studio album in California with producer Dave Sardy in May 2005. The band rehearsed for six weeks at Cherokee Studios, before recording at Sound City, Pass and Sunset Sound Studios. Sardy took a minimalist approach to production, aiming to capture the \\"raw, emotive\\" nature of the band's live shows and prioritising \\"the perfect feeling\\" over a \\"faultless performance\\". Additional contributors to the record included Lenny Castro (percussion), Dan Higgins (flute) and Sardy himself (percussion). \\"Mind's Eye\\" was released as the first single from the upcoming album on 16 October 2005, which reached number 29 on the Australian Singles Chart. Wolfmother was originally released in Australia by Modular on 31 October 2005 and reached number 3 on the ARIA Australian Albums Chart, remaining on the chart for a total of 78 weeks. By the end of 2007, it had been certified five times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), indicating domestic sales in excess of 350,000 units. Wolfmother was recognised by radio station triple j with its inaugural J Award, given to \\"an album of outstanding achievement as an Australian musical work of art - for its creativity, innovation, musicianship and contribution to Australian music.\\" It went on to be nominated for the ARIA Award for Album of the Year in 2006 (and won the awards for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Album and Best Rock Album). Eight of the group's songs were included on the triple j Hottest 100 lists in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In promotion of the album, the band toured throughout Australia in October and November 2005. They also performed at the Big Day Out festival in January and February 2006. Wolfmother performing in May 2007 After its success in Australia, Wolfmother was later released internationally in early 2006 ‚Äì on 24 April in the UK, where it reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart, and on 2 May in the US, where it reached number 22 on the Billboard 200. A number of singles were released from the album, including \\"Woman\\" which reached number 34 in Australia, number 31 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 7 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The song later won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, the nomination for which Heskett had previously described as \\"an honour\\". The final single from the album, \\"Joker & the Thief\\", later reached the top ten in Australia. The subsequent worldwide tour included appearances at festivals such as Fuji Rock in Tokyo, Japan, the inaugural Virgin Festival, and Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK. On 14 November 2006, the band performed a cover version of \\"Communication Breakdown\\" by English hard rock band Led Zeppelin as a tribute to the band for their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame. Stockdale, Ross and Heskett commenced work on the follow-up to Wolfmother in 2007, although Stockdale had previously revealed that he had been planning ideas for the band's second album as early as 2006. One of the new tracks revealed as in the works was \\"Love Attacker\\", which the frontman explained was about \\"people who use love as a weapon to manipulate and get their way through desire\\". This song was later released as \\"Pleased to Meet You\\" on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack in March 2007. Stockdale described the new material as \\"cinematic\\" and \\"epic\\", predicting that the resulting album would be released in early 2008. In September 2007 the band released Please Experience Wolfmother Live, which reached number 7 in Australia and was certified platinum by ARIA. 2008‚Äì11: Lineup change and return with Cosmic Egg Wolfmother returned in 2009 after a brief hiatus with a lineup including Ian Peres, Aidan Nemeth and Dave Atkins. After their performance at Splendour in the Grass on 3 August 2008, it was reported that Wolfmother \\"looked tense and uncommunicative with each other\\", leading to rumours that the band were to imminently break up. In response to the rumours, the band's manager John Watson revealed that he would be \\"releasing a statement about their status soon\\". Days later, it was confirmed that the group had split up ‚Äì in a statement released by Universal Music Australia, it was reported that Ross had left the band straight after the Splendour in the Grass performance due to \\"irreconcilable personal and musical differences\\", after which Heskett decided that he would rather leave than remain in the band without Ross. Ross and Heskett continued to work together on a number of musical projects, including The Slew and Good Heavens. Just a week after the departure of Ross and Heskett, Stockdale returned to recording the second Wolfmother album in Los Angeles, initially working briefly with The Raconteurs drummer Patrick Keeler. After returning to Australia, he enlisted new members Ian Peres (bass, keyboards), Aidan Nemeth (rhythm guitar) and Dave Atkins (drums) for \\"Wolfmother Phase II\\". The new members officially joined on 5 January 2009, before performing their first live shows under the alias \\"White Feather\\" in February. Recording for a new album commenced in March with producer Alan Moulder, with Stockdale describing the material as \\"a little bit heavier\\". The first song released by the second lineup of Wolfmother was \\"Back Round\\", which was made available as a free digital download on the band's official website on 30 March 2009, after its debut live performance the previous week at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. After the rest of the album was recorded, \\"New Moon Rising\\" debuted on Triple J in August and was later released as the album's lead single. The album, Cosmic Egg, was released internationally by Modular in October. It was another commercial success, reaching number 3 in Australia, number 16 in the US, and number 35 in the UK. Cosmic Egg was supported on the New Moon Rising World Tour, which started in Australia and later visited North America and Europe. The group also supported AC/DC on the Black Ice World Tour in Australia. The following year, the album was nominated in the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards for Album of the Year, although it lost out to guitarist Slash's self- titled debut solo album (on which Stockdale is featured on the song \\"By the Sword\\"). In 2010, Will Rockwell-Scott replaced Dave Atkins. This lineup began work on Wolfmother's third album in 2011. In March 2010, Wolfmother contributed the song \\"Fell Down a Hole\\" to the Almost Alice soundtrack. At the end of the month, it was announced that drummer Dave Atkins had left the band. A press release was later issued explaining that the drummer had \\"decided to leave the band to spend much-needed time at home with his family\\". It was announced at the same time that Atkins' replacement would be Will Rockwell- Scott, known for his work with Har Mar Superstar and The Mooney Suzuki. The group continued to tour with Rockwell-Scott, although they had to cancel a string of European dates, including a number of festival appearances, in June and July due to an unspecified illness suffered by Stockdale. The following January and February, the band performed at Big Day Out in Australia and New Zealand. 2011‚Äì13: Planned third album, Stockdale's solo debut Wolfmother began working on their third studio album in March 2011. In May and June they played a number of European shows, performing new material from the upcoming album for the first time. Interviewed in June, Stockdale revealed that approximately \\"12 or 13 songs\\" had been completed and that he was self- producing the album, with engineering to be handled by Aidan Nemeth. The release date of the album was estimated as early 2012, with a number of shows taking place in Australia in promotion; new song titles leaked from set lists included \\"The Year of the Dragon\\", \\"Meridian\\" and \\"Everyday Drone/On the Beach\\". In October 2011, a cover version of the ZZ Top song \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" was featured on the various artists tribute album ZZ Top: A Tribute from Friends. After relatively few updates regarding the upcoming album, in February 2012 both Nemeth and Rockwell-Scott left Wolfmother. Stockdale claimed at the time that the former had chosen to focus on engineering, while the latter was forced to leave due to health concerns. The following month, it was reported that former Vines drummer Hamish Rosser had joined the band. Around the same time, new rhythm guitarist Vin Steele replaced Nemeth, and keyboardist and percussionist Elliott Hammond was also added to the group. Both members' departures were compared in the media to those of original members Ross and Heskett, although Stockdale has denied accusations from some critics that he was to blame for former members leaving the group. The new five-piece lineup continued recording material for the new album, which was delayed further for a 2013 release. At the end of 2012, Stockdale announced that the album was \\"nearly complete\\", and that it would be titled Gatherings. In March 2013, however, Stockdale announced that he would not be releasing the new album under the Wolfmother moniker. Describing the project as \\"a different trip now\\", he revealed to Billboard magazine in April that the album would be released as his solo debut with the title Keep Moving in June. \\"Long Way to Go\\" was released as the lead single from the album. Stockdale later elaborated on the decision to cease using the Wolfmother name; he noted that his desire to self-produce an album played a part in the change, adding the band had a \\"big producer\\" in line to work on their third album but he wanted to release the material he had already recorded, and so he decided to do so under his own name. Keep Moving reached number 32 on the Australian Albums Chart. 2013‚Äì17: Band's return with New Crown and Victorious Andrew Stockdale briefly dropped the Wolfmother moniker in 2013, before returning to using it later in the year. Just two months after Stockdale dropped the band's name, it was announced that Wolfmother were due to return. The news was broken when Stockdale's solo shows were cancelled, shortly before a number of Wolfmother shows in the US were announced in their place. In an interview with Triple M in 2014, Stockdale claimed that he did not intend to drop the Wolfmother name permanently, but instead that it had been temporarily \\"shelved\\" for Keep Moving. Shortly after the band's return, Rosser left and Hammond moved over to drums; however, just a month later Hammond himself left as well, citing scheduling conflicts with his other band The Delta Riggs. Hammond later claimed in 2019 that the announcement was in fact \\"a publicity angle to smooth it over\\". He was replaced briefly by Tony McCall, who left just a few weeks later due to \\"personal reasons\\". Drummer Gregg Bissonette was briefly enlisted to record with the band, although his parts were ultimately not used. In November 2013, Wolfmother returned after a brief hiatus as a trio for the first time since 2008, with rhythm guitarist Vin Steele moving over to drums. The new lineup's first performance took place at The Northern in Byron Bay, and it was hinted at the same time that the group would be working on new material for an album to be released in March or April 2014. The album in question, New Crown, was released without a prior announcement on 24 March 2014 as a digital download on Bandcamp. Self-produced by Stockdale, New Crown was also self-released by the band without a record label; speaking about the decision to do this, Stockdale complained that \\"it's a very long process getting anything done\\" with a label, noting that to avoid potential delays they took the decision to self-release the album. Despite the lack of promotion, New Crown charted on the US Billboard 200 at number 160. The album was promoted on tour in North America during the months after its release. Wolfmother's self-titled debut album was re-released in September 2015 to coincide with its tenth anniversary. In addition to the original 13 tracks, the album contains five B-sides and 15 rare tracks, including 11 previously unreleased recordings. In February 2016, the group's fourth album Victorious was released. The album, produced by Brendan O'Brien, features contributions from drummers Josh Freese and Joey Waronker, in addition to Ian Peres on keyboards. It reached number 17 on the Australian Albums Chart, number 25 in the UK, and number 71 in the US. Lead single \\"Victorious\\" registered at number 26 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Wolfmother promoted Victorious on the Gypsy Caravan Tour, which featured Alex Carapetis on drums. In July 2016, the group supported Guns N' Roses at two US dates on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour. They later returned for shows in Australia and New Zealand in early 2017.  2017‚Äìpresent: Single releases, Slipstream and Rock'n'Roll Baby  Following the conclusion of the Victorious touring cycle, Hamish Rosser returned to Wolfmother. In March 2017, Stockdale released a self- produced song called \\"Special Lady\\", which he recorded on a laptop using the program GarageBand and only a vocal microphone. This was followed in November by the single \\"Freedom Is Mine\\", recorded and produced at Stockdale's home studio in Byron Bay, and \\"Happy Wolfmothers Day\\" in May 2018. Peres left in early 2018 after nine years with the band, committing to tour dates with Xavier Rudd instead. Stockdale and Rosser have performed with multiple touring lineups of the group since Peres' departure: in April 2018 with Dave Atkins on rhythm guitar and Jake Bennett on bass, from May with Brad Heald on bass and Lachy Doley on keyboards, and later in the year with Katie McGurl in place of Doley. Bobby Poulton began playing bass and keyboards in October 2018 and is now the current session player in the band. In September 2018, Stockdale released his second solo album, Slipstream, which he promoted on a short concert tour. In April 2019, Stockdale began recording material for a fifth Wolfmother album at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 in Northridge, Los Angeles. This album, titled Rock'n'Roll Baby, wound up being released on 29 December 2019. Musical style and critical reception Upon the release of their debut album, Wolfmother received comparisons to influential hard rock and heavy metal bands of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly Led Zeppelin,Sources comparing Wolfmother to Led Zeppelin:  * * Black Sabbath,Sources comparing Wolfmother to Black Sabbath:  * and Blue Cheer.Sources comparing Wolfmother to Blue Cheer: * * AskMen went as far as to rank the band as the second top Led Zeppelin \\"rip-off\\" band.

Many of these comparisons to other bands continued in reviews for Cosmic Egg, New Crown, and Victorious. Despite these comparisons to other artists, Wolfmother was praised by the majority of commentators ‚Äì aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 76, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\", with 18 of the 22 included critical reviews categorised as positive. Many elements of the band's music on their debut album were praised by critics, including the psychedelic subject matter of the lyrics, the interplay between each member of the band, and the combination of classic and modern elements. However, some commentators criticised the album for its derivative nature, claiming that it offered no originality to the genre. Critical reception to Cosmic Egg was less positive, with Metacritic reporting a normalised rating of 65 and many critics noting a lack of invention or progression on the album.

She worked with Bags, The Gun Club, Fur Bible, The Sisters of Mercy and The Damned. Biography Patricia Anne Rainone was active in the Los Angeles, California punk rock scene in her mid-teens, and was a founding member of The Bags in 1976. She left that band after a fallout with co-founder Alice Bag. She began Legal Weapon in 1980, releasing an EP called No Sorrow in 1981. Morrison joined The Gun Club in 1982, quitting after her second tour with them. She then formed the band Fur Bible with Kid Congo Powers, performing as the opening act for Siouxsie and the Banshees. Australian rocker and vocalist Tex Perkins was also offered a spot in Fur Bible and travelled to the UK to perform in band rehearsals. However, on arrival into the UK, Perkins was denied entry due to him not having secured any form of visa prior to leaving Australia. During this time Morrison was contacted by Andrew Eldritch, asking her to join The Sisters of Mercy. She performed on the 1986 album Gift (released under the group name The Sisterhood) and on The Sisters of Mercy's 1987 album Floodland. According to Jennifer Park: The Sisters of Mercy song \\"Lucretia My Reflection\\" was written by Eldritch about Morrison. The lyrics compare her to the historical figure of Lucrezia Borgia. She left the band in the early 1990s, claiming money that was owed by Eldritch was not paid. In 1994, Morrison released a solo album, Reflect on This. In 1996, she joined The Damned after bassist Paul Gray was injured by a fan in concert. That same year Morrison married the Damned's lead singer Dave Vanian. After giving birth to Emily Vanian in 2004, Morrison retired from the Damned. In 2020, Morrison provided the voice of the character Annabelle on horror punk band Creeper's sophomore album, Sex, Death & the Infinite Void.

He was a hard-working administrator and a micromanager. The Sui Shu records him as having withdrawn his favour from the Confucians, giving it to \\"the group advocating Xing-Ming and authoritarian government.\\"Creel, What Is Taoism?, 112 As a Buddhist, he encouraged the spread of Buddhism through the state. He is regarded as one of the most important emperors in ancient China history, reunifying China in 589 after centuries of division since the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in 316. During his reign, the construction of the Grand Canal began. As a Northern Zhou official, Yang Jian served with apparent distinction during the reigns of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou and Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou. When the erratic Emperor Xuan died in 580, Yang, as his father-in-law, seized power as regent. After defeating the general Yuchi Jiong, who resisted him, he seized the throne for himself, establishing the new Sui Dynasty (as its Emperor Wen). He was the first Chinese to rule the entire North China after the Xianbei clans conquered that area from the Liu Song dynasty (not counting the brief reconquest of that region by Emperor Wu of Liang). Generally speaking, Emperor Wen's reign was a great period of prosperity not seen since the Han Dynasty. Economically, the dynasty prospered. It was said that there was enough food stored for 50 years. The military was also powerful. At the beginning of his reign, Sui faced the threat of the G√∂kt√ºrks to the north, and neighbored Tibetan tribes to the west, Goguryeo in the northeast, and Champa (Linyi) threatening the south. By the end of Emperor Wen's reign, the G√∂kt√ºrks had split into an eastern and a western kaganate, the eastern one being nominally submissive to Sui, as was Goguryeo. Champa was defeated and, while not conquered, did not remain a threat. Emperor Wen is also famous for having the fewest concubines for an adult Chinese emperor. (Emperor Fei of Western Wei and the Ming dynasty Hongzhi Emperor were the only two perpetually monogamous Chinese emperors.) Emperor Wen was known for having only two concubines (although he might have had additional concubines not documented by traditional historians), with whom he might not have had sexual relations until after the death in 602 of his wife Empress Dugu, whom he loved and respected deeply. Early life The Yang clan of Hongnong (ÂºòËæ≤Ê•äÊ∞è) were claimed as ancestors by the Sui Emperors, similar to the Tang Emperors' claim of the Longxi Li clan. Yang Jian's clan claimed descent from the Han Dynasty general Yang Zhen. Yang Zhen's eighth-generation descendant Yang Xuan () served as a commandery governor for a Yan state (Former Yan or Later Yan) during the Sixteen Kingdoms Period, and his descendants subsequently served the Northern Wei Dynasty. Yang Jian's father Yang Zhong () followed the late-Northern Wei general Yuwen Tai and later became prominent in the branch successor state of Northern Wei, Western Wei, under Yuwen's regency. Yang Jian's mother Lady L√º gave birth to him at a Buddhist temple in Pingyi (È¶ÆÁøä, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). A Buddhist nun was impressed with his appearance, and raised him in his early years.Book of Sui, vol. 1. Yang Jian attended the imperial college for the sons of the nobility and high officials.. When he was 14 years old, he was appointed to serve in the military under Yuwen Tai. In 555, on account of Yang Zhong's accomplishments, Yang Jian received several official ranks, including the title of the Duke of Chengji County (). In 557, Dugu Xin, impressed with Yang Jian, gave his daughter, Empress Dugu Qieluo, to Yang and made her his wife. He was 16, and she was 13. After Yuwen Tai's son Emperor Ming of Northern Zhou came to the throne later that year, Yang Jian was made the vice minister of internal affairs, and he was created the greater title of Duke of Daxing Commandery (). Subsequently, during the reign of Emperor Ming's brother Emperor Wu, Yang Jian was further promoted in military authority. After Yang Zhong's death in 568, he inherited the title of Duke of Sui. In 573, Emperor Wu took Yang Jian's daughter Yang Lihua to be the wife and crown princess of his son Yuwen Yun the Crown Prince, and further honored Yang Jian. It was said that, however, that Yang Jian was so unusual in his appearance that some of Emperor Wu's close associates suspected Yang Jian of eventually harboring treasonous intent. Both Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi and the general Wang Gui () were said to have suggested that Emperor Wu execute Yang Jian, but Emperor Wu resisted. Still, Yang Jian heard rumors and tried to hide his own talent to avoid trouble. It was not until 575 when Emperor Wu involved Yang Jian in a major campaign against rival Northern Qi. Yang Jian also participated in the 576‚Äì577 campaign that saw Emperor Wu being able to destroy Northern Qi and seize its territory. In 578, Emperor Wu died, and Yuwen Yun took the throne as Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan immediately began to show erratic behavior, and while he created Yang Jian's daughter Crown Princess Yang empress, he suspected Yang Jian deeply, although he made Yang Jian the minister of defense. In 579, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (by his concubine Consort Zhu Manyue) (as Emperor Jing) and became retired emperor (with the atypical title of \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Tianyuan Huangdi), but continued to exercise imperial powers. On one occasion, he became so suspicious of Yang Jian that he stated to Empress Yang, \\"I will surely slaughter your clan!\\" He then summoned Yang Jian to the palace, with instructions to kill him if his expressions betrayed any worries, but Yang Jian arrived without showing any unusual emotions, and avoided being killed. On another occasion, Empress Yang displeased Emperor Xuan, and Emperor Xuan ordered her to commit suicide. When Duchess Dugu heard this, she went to the palace to beg Emperor Xuan's forgiveness, and Emperor Xuan eventually spared Empress Yang. Regency In summer 581, with Emperor Xuan intending to conquer Chen Dynasty, he sent Yang Jian to be the commandant at Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Lu'an, Anhui) to prepare for the campaign against Chen. Before Yang Jian could depart, however, Emperor Xuan suddenly grew seriously ill. Two of Emperor Xuan's close associates, Liu Fang () and Zheng Yi (), who were friends of Yang's, summoned Yang to the palace to prepare to serve as regent, overriding the desire of another closet associate, Yan Zhiyi (), to have Emperor Xuan's uncle Yuwen Zhao () the Prince of Zhao appointed regent. Emperor Xuan soon died, and Zheng and Liu issued an edict in Emperor Xuan's name appointing Yang regent. Yang immediately pleased the officials at the capital by abolishing the wastefulness and cruel policies of Emperor Xuan, and he himself demonstrated both hard work and frugality, which impressed the people. Fearful of the intentions of the general Yuchi Jiong, who was then the commandant at Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), he summoned Yuchi back to the capital. Yuchi, however, refused, and believing that Yang's intentions were to usurp the throne, rose at Xiang Province against Yang. He was supported by the generals Sima Xiaonan (), the commandant at Xun Province (ÂãõÂ∑û, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) and Wang Qian (), the commandant at Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, just 68 days after Yuchi rose in rebellion, the general Wei Xiaokuan defeated Yuchi, and Yuchi committed suicide. Wang was also soon defeated, and Sima fled to Chen. To prevent Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng to be used again as a base of opposition against him, Yang Jian had Yecheng (Northern Qi's old capital) torn down. During Yuchi's campaign, Zhou princes like Yuwen Xian Prince of Bi and Yuwen Zhao made attempts to assassinate Yang, but failed. In response, Yang put Yuwen Xian, Yuwen Zhao and Zhao's younger brother Yuwen Sheng () the Prince of Yue and their sons to death, and after Yuchi was defeated, he began to slaughter the Yuwen clan in earnest. He also had Emperor Jing promote his titles quickly, and he changed his surname back to Yang. Around the new year 581, his title was promoted to Prince of Sui (). In spring 581, he had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty, as its Emperor Wen. (His use of \\"Sui\\" as his new dynasty name was typical of Chinese historical dynastic transitions‚Äîusing the old fief name as the new dynasty's name‚Äîbut he, believing that the character for his fief Sui () to contain a \\"Ëæ∂\\" radical, denoting \\"walking\\" and therefore a lack of permanence in the regime, removed \\"Ëæ∂\\" from the character, rendering it \\"Èöã\\".) Early Kaihuang era Emperor Wen abolished Northern Zhou's governmental organization of six departments, instead establishing five main bureaus‚Äîexecutive bureau (Shangshu Sheng (), examination bureau (Menxia Sheng (), legislative bureau (Neish«ê Sheng (), Palace Library, and eunuch bureau (Neish√¨ Sheng (ÂÖß‰æçÁúÅ‚Äînote different tone and character versus 'legislative bureau')), with two additional independent agencies, 11 other independent departments, and 12 military commands. He posthumously honored his father Yang Zhong and mother Lady Lu as emperor and empress. He created his wife Duchess Dugu empress and their oldest son Yang Yong crown prince; he created his brothers and his other sons imperial princes. He initially created Northern Zhou's Emperor Jing the Duke of Jie, but soon slaughtered all grandsons of Yuwen Tai, and eventually put the Duke of Jie to death as well. He entrusted most of the important governmental matters to his officials Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Su Wei. Agreeing with some officials' assertions that Northern Zhou fell because its imperial princes lacked power to protect the central government, he sent his sons out to key provinces with broad powers. He further commissioned the official Pei Zheng () to carry out a project of simplifying the penal code and decrease the penalty from the harsh laws‚Äîa reform that was later largely accepted by the succeeding dynasties. Emperor Wen did not maintain as submissive a relationship with the G√∂kt√ºrks, which brought resentment from the G√∂kt√ºrks' Œ™≈°bara qaŒ≥an Ashina Helu. The qaŒ≥an's wife, the Xianbei princess Qianjin, Yuwen Zhao's daughter, particularly hated Emperor Wen for destroying the Northern Zhou. Ashina Helu therefore carried out a series of border attacks against Sui, allied with Gao Baoning (), the former Northern Qi general who was still holding Ying Province (ÁáüÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning). In response, under advice from the general Zhangsun Sheng (), Emperor Wen carried out the strategy of placating Ashina Helu's subordinate qaŒ≥ans‚Äîhis uncle Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue (), cousin Abo Khan Ashina Daxianbian (), and brother Ashina Chuluohou () ‚Äì to create dissension within the G√∂kt√ºrks, and gradually, the strategy worked, causing the G√∂kt√ºrks to be unable to take unified actions against Sui. In 581, Emperor Wen commissioned a major attack on Chen, and while it was initially successful, Emperor Wen withdrew the attack in spring 582 after hearing that Emperor Xuan of Chen had died and believing it wrongful to attack a state whose emperor had just died. In 582, believing that Chang'an was too small of a city, Emperor Wen built a new capital nearby, which he named Daxing, and in spring 583 he moved the capital to Daxing. (From that point forward, Daxing and Chang'an became interchangeable names, although by the time of succeeding Tang Dynasty, the new capital was known again just as Chang'an.) Also in 582, Emperor Wen, thankful for the refusal by the vassal Emperor Ming of Western Liang to support Yuchi Jiong in 580, withdrew his forces from Western Liang's capital Jiangling, permitting Western Liang a degree of self-governance. He also took Emperor Ming's daughter as the wife and princess to his son, Yang Guang the Prince of Jin. (After Emperor Ming's death in 585 and succession by his son Emperor Jing of Western Liang, however, Emperor Wen reestablished the post of commandant of Jiangling and again put Western Liang territory under military control.) By spring 583, the G√∂kt√ºrks' internal dissension had become serious enough that Emperor Wen felt comfortable enough to commission his brother Yang Shuang () the Prince of Wei to command a major attack against Ashina Shetu. Yang Shuang achieved a great victory, and part of his army, commanded by the general Yin Shou (), defeated Gao, forcing Gao to try to flee to the Qidan, but on the way, Gao was killed by his own subordinates, ending the very last bit of Northern Qi resistance. After the defeat, the various subordinate khans further engaged in battles among themselves and against Ashina Shetu, with Sui watching by, refusing to give aid to any side. By 584, Ashina Shetu submitted to Sui, and even the resentful Princess Qianjin referred to Emperor Wen as \\"father.\\" He created her the Princess Dayi. In summer 584, believing that the Wei River, on account of its sandbars and treacherous waters, was becoming too difficult of a route for food transport to Daxing, commissioned the official Yuwen Kai () to construct a canal between Daxing and Tong Pass, parallel to the Wei River, named the Guangtong Canal (), greatly easing the transport of food and other supplies to the capital region Guanzhong. Nevertheless, on account of a famine in Guanzhong in fall 584, Emperor Wen briefly took up residence in Luoyang. In 586, the officials Liang Shiyan () the Duke of Cheng, Yuwen Xin () the Duke of Qi, and Liu Fang the Duke of Shu‚Äîall three of whom were friends of Emperor Wen but all of whom believed that they had been slighted by Emperor Wen‚Äîwere accused of plotting rebellion, and all three were executed. In spring 587, continuing his canal- building regime, Emperor Wen built the Shanyang Canal () between the Yangtze River and the Huai River to improve the transport of material between those two rivers. In fall 587, Emperor Wen summoned Western Liang's Emperor Jing to Chang'an to meet him. Emperor Jing complied with the direction. While Emperor Jing was away, however, Emperor Wen, believing that Jiangling would not be guarded well, sent his general Cui Hongdu () to Jiangling. Emperor Jing's uncle Xiao Yan () the Prince of Anping and Xiao Huan () the Prince of Yixing instead believed that Cui was intending to attack the city, and they took the populace of the city and surrendered to the Chen general Chen Huiji (), the cousin to Chen's emperor Chen Shubao. In response, Emperor Wen abolished Western Liang, directly seizing its territory, while creating Emperor Jing the Duke of Ju. Emperor Wen, who had been planning to conquer Chen for years, now further enhanced his planning in earnest. In spring 588, Emperor Wen publicly announced a campaign against Chen, commanded by Yang Guang, another of his sons Yang Jun the Prince of Qin, and Yang Su, with Yang Guang in overall command. Gao Jiong served as Yang Guang's assistant. In spring 589, the Sui general Heruo Bi () crossed the Yangtze at Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), and the Sui general Han Qinhu () crossed the Yangtze at Caishi (ÈááÁü≥, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui). Meanwhile, Yang Su was advancing from the west down the Yangtze, and Yang Jun was stationed in the middle Yangtze region, cutting off any Chen forces that might have been able to come to the aid of Chen's capital Jiankang. Heruo soon defeated and captured the Chen general Xiao Mohe, who was making a final attempt to repel Heruo and Han's forces from Jiankang, and Jiankang fell immediately after. Chen Shubao was captured but not harmed. Rather, he and his clan members were transported to Chang'an, where Emperor Wen treated them as honored guests. Some Chen generals briefly resisted, but soon the Sui had control. The Southern and Northern Dynasties period was over, and Sui had united China. Much as how he had torn down Yecheng after Yuchi defeat, Emperor Wen tore down Jiankang, establishing only a minor garrison at the nearby Shitou as Jiang Province (). Late Kaihuang era In 590, apparently jealous of the talent of the official Li Delin, who had been key in his takeover of power as regent and who had contributed to the strategies in conquering Chen, Emperor Wen, believing in several false accusations against Li, removed Li from his office and made him a provincial governor. Li would not return to the central government for the rest of his life. After Chen was conquered, Sui began to apply its laws over Chen's former territory‚Äîwhich brought resentment from the gentry, as they had been treated preferentially under Chen and its predecessor dynasties in the south. Su Wei further wrote a work known as the Five Teachings (‰∫îÊïô, Wu Jiao) which is no longer extant but thought to be a work about loyalty to Sui and ordered that all former Chen subjects read and memorize it, leading to further resentment. When a rumor spread that Sui would move Chen subjects into the Guanzhong region in 590, nearly all of former Chen realm rose in rebellion, but in an unorganized manner. Emperor Wen sent Yang Su to quell the rebellions, and the rebels were no match for Yang Su; within the year, the rebellions were put down. In 591, Tuyuhun sought peace and, as per custom, its khan Murong Shifu () offered his daughter to be a concubine for Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen accepted the peace offer but declined the offer of Murong Shifu's daughter. (It was, however, around this time that he did take Chen Shubao's sister and another woman from Jiankang, Consort Cai, as concubines, although it appeared likely that Consort Cai was never able to have sexual relations with Emperor Wen while Empress Dugu was alive; Consort Chen, as the sister of a submissive former sovereign, might have had sexual relations with Emperor Wen on an infrequent basis, but it is not clear.) In spring 592, the official He Tuo (), who, despite his senior status over Su Wei's son Su Kui (), was losing out against Su Kui over a debate as to the designation of official music styles for Sui. In anger, He Tuo accused Su Wei of factionalism, and after investigation by Emperor Wen's son Yang Xiu and the official Yu Qingze (ted zhang), Su Wei was removed from office. After Su Wei's removal, Yang Su and Gao Jiong became effectively the co-prime ministers. When Heruo Bi, who believed that he should have been prime minister, complained, Emperor Wen removed him from his post as well and stripped him of his ducal title, but restored the ducal title a year later. (Su Wei, however, was back in his post at the latest by 595.) Also in 592, Emperor Wen, reacting to an overflowing abundance of food and silk in the governmental stores, reduced the taxes heavily, and he also sent messengers around central China, redistributing land to give the poor farming land. In 593, Emperor Wen commissioned a summer vacation palace, Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), away from Chang'an, with Yang Su in charge of the project. The palace was far more luxurious than Emperor Wen expected, and its construction cost many lives. (When it was completed in spring 595 and Emperor Wen visited the palace, he was initially very displeased with Yang Su, but Empress Dugu persuaded him that Yang Su knew that he had little other entertainment, and she awarded Yang Su much treasure to show appreciation.) Also in 593, knowing that the Princess Dayi was still resentful of him, Emperor Wen had the official Pei Ju inform the cousin and subordinate khan to the G√∂kt√ºrks' Dulan Khan, Ashina Yongyul√º, the Tuli Khan Ashina Rangan (son of Ashina Chuluohou) that he would let Ashina Rangan marry a Sui princess if Ashina Rangan was able to get Princess Dayi killed. Ashina Rangan, in response, accused Princess Dayi of adultery, and Ashina Yongyul√º killed her and requested another marriage with Sui. Instead, Emperor Wen agreed to marry a princess to Ashina Rangan, in order to create greater friction between them. In 594, in response to another famine in the Guanzhong region, Emperor Wen again temporarily took up residence in Luoyang. He also, to share in some of his people's suffering, abstained from meat for a year. Late in 594, Yang Guang submitted a petition that Emperor Wen carry out the ancient ceremonies of worshipping the heaven and earth gods at Mount Tai. Emperor Wen declined to carry out a full set of ceremonies due to its costs, but in spring 595 carried out an abbreviated version to seek blessings from the gods due to the ongoing drought. Also in spring 595, Emperor Wen ordered that no weapons be held by private individuals and that all of them be collected and destroyed, although he exempted the border provinces from this edict. In 596, Emperor Wen created a daughter of a clansman the Princess Guanghua and married her to Murong Shifu, to cement the peaceful relations with Tuyuhun. In 597, Cuan Wan (), the chief of the Nanning Tribe (ÂçóÂØßÂ§∑, located in modern Qujing, Yunnan), rebelled. Emperor Wen sent the general Shi Wansui () the Duke of Taiping against Cuan, forcing him to surrender. Initially, Shi was to take Cuan to Chang'an to be presented to Emperor Wen, but Cuan bribed Shi, and so Shi allowed him to stay. Also in 597, Li Guangshi (), the chief of the aborigine people in Gui Province (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi), also rebelled. Emperor Wen sent the generals Wang Shiji () and Zhou Fashang () against Li, and Zhou was able to defeat and kill Li. However, in the fall, Li Shixian (), who might have been related to Li Guangshi, rebelled at Gui Province, and Emperor Wen sent Yu Qingze the Duke of Lu to attack Li Shixian; Yu was successful in suppressing the rebellion. Subsequently, however, Yu's brother-in-law Zhao Shizhu (), who had an affair with Yu's concubine, falsely accused Yu of treason, and around the new year 598, Yu was executed. Also in 597, Emperor Wen felt that the punishment for official misconduct was too light, and authorized that supervising officials would be permitted to batter their subordinates with large canes if they felt that the legally prescribed punishment was too light in comparison to the degree of misconduct. Further, also believing that there was too much theft and robbery throughout the realm, he increased the punishment for theft to death‚Äîa law that he subsequently abolished. Also in 597, Emperor Wen's son Yang Jun the Prince of Qin, the commandant at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly Taiyuan, Shanxi), was poisoned, but not to death, by his jealous wife Princess Cui. After Yang Jun was taken back to Chang'an for treatment, Emperor Wen discovered that Yang Jun had been wasteful at his post, and removed him from all of his offices, allowing him to only retain the title of imperial prince. When Princess Cui's poisoning was discovered, Emperor Wen ordered Yang Jun to divorce her, and subsequently ordered her to commit suicide. When Liu Sheng () and Yang Su suggested that the punishment against Yang Jun was overly severe, Emperor Wen responded to Yang Su: :I am the father of just five sons, not the father of all people over the land. If I agreed with you, does that mean I have to draft a Penal Code for the Emperor's Sons? Even a man as kind as the Duke of Zhou executed his brothers, the lords of Guan and Cai, for their crimes. I am nowhere as capable as the Duke of Zhou, so I can break my own laws? Also in 597, Ashina Rangan arrived at Chang'an, and Emperor Wen gave him the daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Anyi, to be his wife, and awarded Ashina Rangan with much treasure, to try to break the bond between him and Ashina Yongyul√º. From this point on, whenever Ashina Yongyul√º would prepare to attack, Ashina Rangan would report his plans to Emperor Wen, allowing Sui forces to become prepared. In 598, King Yeongyang of Goguryeo attacked Ying Province, and while the governor of Ying Province, Wei Chong (), fought off the Goguryeo attack, Emperor Wen was angered. He sent his son Yang Liang the Prince of Han and Wang Shiji to serve as commanding generals, with Gao Jiong serving as Yang Liang's assistant, and the former Chen general Zhou Luohou () serving as the commander of the navy, to attack Goguryeo. However, the forces ran into food supply problems, and the ships ran into a storm and suffered great losses. Both at sea and on the ground, Goguryeo forces inflicted heavy losses on the Sui forces. Nevertheless, King Yeongyang ceased his raids into China and so Emperor Wen called off the campaign against Goguryeo, unable to commit yet another enormous force to punish Goguryeo after the recent losses. As King Wideok of Baekje offered assistance to Sui during the campaign, this precipitated a conflict between Goguryeo and Baekje. Also in 598, Cuan Wan rebelled again, and Yang Xiu accused Shi of accepting bribes from Cuan earlier. Emperor Wen considered executing Shi, but ultimately chose only to remove him from his posts, and it appeared soon after Shi was restored to his post. In 599, after Ashina Rangan reported that Ashina Yongyul√º was planning to attack, Emperor Wen took preemptive action and had Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Yan Rong () command a three-pronged attack against Ashina Yongyul√º, with Yang Liang in nominal command but not at the frontline. In response, Ashina Yongyul√º and Ashina Dianjue made a joint attack against Ashina Rangan, defeating him and largely seizing his tribe. Ashina Rangan fled to Sui, and Emperor Wen treated him as an honored guest. Subsequently, both Gao Jiong and Yang Su engaged G√∂kt√ºrk forces and repelled them. Also in 599, with Wang Shiji's subordinate Huangfu Xiaoxie () accusing Wang of treason after Wang refused to shield Huangfu after he committed crimes, Emperor Wen believed Huangfu and executed Wang. By this point, Yang Yong the Crown Prince had lost the favor of both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, over his being overly wasteful (which displeased Emperor Wen) and having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). They therefore considered deposing him and replacing him with Yang Guang. When Empress Dugu hinted as such, Gao Jiong stated clear opposition. Meanwhile, Emperor Wen himself had engaged in sexual relations with Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter, who had been made a servant after her grandfather's defeat‚Äîand when Empress Dugu found out, she had Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter killed. Emperor Wen was exceedingly angry and rode away from the palace on a horse, returning to the palace only at the urging of Gao and Yang Su‚Äîbut with Gao further angering Empress Dugu when Gao referred to her as \\"a woman.\\" In 599, Gao was accused of associating with Wang Shiji and removed from his posts. Subsequently, Gao was accused of cursing Emperor Wen, but when the sentence of death was recommended, Emperor Wen commented that he could not kill Gao soon after killing Yu and Wang, and therefore only reduced Gao to commoner rank. In winter 599, Emperor Wen created Ashina Rangan Qimin Khan, and commissioned Zhangsun Sheng to build the city of Dali (Â§ßÂà©, in modern Hohhot) to house Ashian Rangan's people, and also sent an army to protect Ashina Rangan. By now, the Princess Anyi had died, and Emperor Wen married another daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Yicheng (), to marry Ashina Rangan. Soon thereafter, Ashina Yongyul√º was assassinated, and Ashina Dianjue declared himself Bujia Khan. In summer 600, Ashina Dianjue attacked Ashina Rangan, and Sui forces fought off Ashina Dianjue's attack, further causing Ashina Rangan to be grateful to Sui. In fall 600, with Yang Guang and Yang Su forming a faction, with tacit support of Empress Dugu, they had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei () falsely accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason. Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang. Emperor Wen also put a number of officials whom he believed to be part of Yang Yong's faction, including Shi and Yuan Min () the Duke of Wuyuan, to death. Renshou era In 602, Empress Dugu died, and Emperor Wen was greatly saddened. Thereafter, he began to engage in sexual relations with his concubines, favoring Consort Chen and Consort Cai. Also in 602, Yang Guang, believing that Yang Xiu would eventually create trouble for him, had Yang Su collect evidence of Yang Xiu's wastefulness and use of items that were only appropriate for emperors. Yang Su submitted the evidence to Emperor Wen, and Emperor Wen, in anger, recalled Yang Xiu to the capital. After Yang Xiu arrived at the capital, Yang Guang further manufactured evidence that Yang Xiu had cursed Emperor Wen and Yang Liang. In anger, Emperor Wen reduced Yang Xiu to commoner rank and put him under house arrest. In 603, Ashina Dianjue, faced with rebellions from the Tiele and Pugu () tribes, surrendered to Ashina Rangan. By now, Ashina Rangan became the undisputed khan of the G√∂kt√ºrks. In spring 604, Emperor Wen, as per his custom, went to Renshou Palace to avoid the heat, despite warnings from the sorcerer Zhangchou Taiyi () that if he went, he would never return. While there, he grew ill, and in fall 604, he died. He was buried at the Yangling District's Tailing () tumulus mausoleum, with Empress Dugu (though not in the same burial chamber). How Emperor Wen died, however, is a matter of historical controversy. Most traditional historians relay and believe an account in which, while Emperor Wen was ill, Yang Guang tried to rape Consort Chen. When she reported the attempted rape to Emperor Wen, he became angry and had the officials Liu Shu (Êü≥Ëø∞, the husband of his daughter Yang Awu () the Princess Lanling) and Yuan Yan () the Duke of Longgu summon Yang Yong, intending to restore him. When Yang Guang found out, he, in association with Yang Su, had Liu and Yuan arrested, and then sent his associate Zhang Heng () to kill Emperor Wen, and Zhang did so. Soon thereafter, he forced Consorts Chen and Cai to become his concubines and had Yang Yong put to death, and only then announced Emperor Wen's death and took the throne (as Emperor Yang). The historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, borrowing parts of analyses from the Book of Sui and the History of the Northern Dynasties, opined: Emperor Wen also established seven orchestras comprising musicians from across Asia at his court; these orchestras were expanded to nine by his son Emperor Yang of Sui.

Glacial lakes have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in this region during the last few decades. USGS researchers have found a strong correlation between increasing temperatures and glacial retreat in this region. Glacial motion is the motion of glaciers, which can be likened to rivers of ice. It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers. Glacial motion can be fast (up to 30 meters/day, observed on Jakobshavn Isbr√¶ in Greenland) or slow (0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets), but is typically around 25 cm/day. Processes of motion Glacier motion occurs from four processes, all driven by gravity: basal sliding, glacial quakes generating fractional movements of large sections of ice, bed deformation, and internal deformation. * In the case of basal sliding, the entire glacier slides over its bed. This type of motion is enhanced if the bed is soft sediment, if the glacier bed is thawed and if meltwater is prevalent. * Bed deformation is thus usually limited to areas of sliding. Seasonal melt ponding and penetrating under glaciers shows seasonal acceleration and deceleration of ice flows affecting whole icesheets.Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow Originally published in Science Express on 6 June 2002, Science 12 July 2002: Vol. 297. no. 5579, pp. 218 - 222. * Some glaciers experience glacial quakes‚Äîglaciers \\"as large as Manhattan and as tall as the Empire State Building, can move 10 meters in less than a minute, a jolt that is sufficient to generate moderate seismic waves.\\" There has been an increasing pattern of these ice quakes - \\"Quakes ranged from six to 15 per year from 1993 to 2002, then jumped to 20 in 2003, 23 in 2004, and 32 in the first 10 months of 2005.\\"Glacial earthquakes rock Greenland ice sheet 12:36 24 March 2006, NewScientist.com news service A glacier that is frozen up to its bed does not experience basal sliding. * Internal deformation occurs when the weight of the ice causes the deformation of ice crystals. This takes place most readily near the glacier bed, where pressures are highest. There are glaciers that primarily move via sliding, glacial quakes, and others that move almost entirely through deformation.  Terminus movement and mass balance  If a glacier's terminus moves forward faster than it melts, the net result is advance. Glacier retreat occurs when more material ablates from the terminus than is replenished by flow into that region. Glaciologists consider that trends in mass balance for glaciers are more fundamental than the advance or retreat of the termini of individual glaciers. In the years since 1960, there has been a striking decline in the overall volume of glaciers worldwide. This decline is correlated with global warming. As a glacier thins, due to the loss of mass it will slow down and crevassing will decrease. Landscape and geology Studying glacial motion and the landforms that result requires tools from many different disciplines: physical geography, climatology, and geology are among the areas sometime grouped together and called earth science. During the Pleistocene (the last ice age), huge sheets of ice called continental glaciers advanced over much of the earth. The movement of these continental glaciers created many now-familiar glacial landforms. As the glaciers were expanded, due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice, they crushed and redistributed surface rocks, creating erosional landforms such as striations, cirques, and hanging valleys. Later, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand, depositional landforms were created, such as moraines, eskers, drumlins, and kames. The stone walls found in New England (northeastern United States) contain many glacial erratics, rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin. At some point, if an Alpine glacier becomes too thin it will stop moving. This will result in the end of any basal erosion. The stream issuing from the glacier will then become clearer as glacial flour diminishes. Lakes and ponds can also be caused by glacial movement. Kettle lakes form when a retreating glacier leaves behind an underground chunk of ice. Moraine-dammed lakes occur when a stream (or snow runoff) is dammed by glacial till.

(2 h 00 min) History In the 12th century Aztecas moved away from Aztlan looking for a new land to settle. In this travel they founded several towns. Zula (meaning quails territory) was one of this towns established on the shore of the Lerma river. In 1380, Tari√°curi purepecha's king, conquered the town of Zula and named it Aramutaro, which means place with caves. Almost two centuries later, Antonio de Villarroel serving Nu√±o de Guzm√°n took control of the town on the San Sebastian's day of 1530 (January 20), so renaming the town as \\"San Sebasti√°n de Aramutarillo\\". From 1530 to 1687, San Sebastian was in total oblivion, victim of slavery and ignorance; nevertheless there were two historic facts, which changed course for the town, one political affair and another religious matter. The religious matter refers to a finding of a branch from a tree resembling Jesus Christ on the Cross. This happened the midnight of Christmas Eve on a place called Buena Huerta. The towns in its surrounding asked for the Jesus Christ image to be taken to their churches. San Sebasti√°n de Aramutarillo was selected to keep the Christ image. After that, the Christ image was called \\"Se√±or de La Piedad\\" (Lord of Mercy) where Templo del Senor de La Piedad was built in its honor, which also has the biggest dome in the country. The political affair was the movement of political offices from Tlazazalca to San Sebastian de Aramutarillo. This causes that many people came to offer merchandise, crafts, etc. In this way the town was officially founded in 1692, when Juan L√≥pez de Aguirre named it as La Piedad. Attractions Places of interest include the town center with its kiosco (bandstand) built with quarried stone, the gateways, and the Se√±or de La Piedad church, which boasts perhaps the biggest dome in the country. Also of note are the Cabadas Bridge and the 30-metre-high El Salto waterfall. The local zoo and \\"La Torre de la Gaviota\\" located at the Ciudad del Sol neighborhood, are also places of interest in La Piedad. There are also urban parks such as Morelos Park and La Placa park. The city is known because of its colorful Rebozos, and the singer Jos√© Alfredo Jim√©nez made it more famous with the song \\"El Perro Negro\\" (\\"The Black Dog\\"). Industry La Piedad is a hub for agricultural products. The town was once known as the center of the Mexican pork industry, and still plays an important part in that industry. However, La Piedad has recently moved its economy towards textiles. Major textil manufacturers include Olmeca, Marval and Manriquez. Surrounding towns are Santa Ana, Yurecuaro, Degollado, Numaran, and Ecuandureo. La Piedad is also the headquarters for veterinary pharmaceuticals company LaPisa and industrial turbine manufacturer Turbomaquinas and Famaq. Also there is an important candy factory named Cabadas and sausage factories like Nu-tres, Delta and Bafar (former Parma). Most companies are family owned and operated. These are Salda√±a and Garc√≠a, the latter owns Turbomaquinas S.A. de C.V., FAMAQ, Turboaleaciones S.A. de C.V. and the former owns Grupo Kasto. There are 569 companies registered in the municipality, which puts La Piedad in the top four cities in the state with the greatest number of companies, after Morelia, Uruapan, and Zamora.

Diagram showing location of amputation Onychectomy, popularly known as declawing, is an operation to remove an animal's claws surgically by means of the amputation of all or part of the distal phalanges, or end bones, of the animal's toes. Because the claw develops from germinal tissue within the third phalanx, amputation of the bone is necessary to fully remove the claw. The terms \\"onychectomy\\" (origin: Greek ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ onyx, nail + ·ºêŒ∫œÑŒøŒºŒÆ ektomƒì, excision) and \\"declawing\\" imply mere claw removal, but a more appropriate description would be phalangectomy, excision of toe bone. Although common in North America, declawing is considered an act of animal cruelty in many countries (see \\"Declawing practices\\" below). Medically indicated onychectomy The amputation of the distal phalanx is indicated in case of chronic inflammatory processes, tumours, persistent and severe infections and gangrene that are limited to the distal phalanx. The procedure is usually limited to the affected claw, leaving the healthy claws (if any) intact. Elective onychectomy In North America, declawing is commonly performed on cats to prevent damage to household possessions by scratching and to prevent scratching of people. The surgery involves amputating the distal phalanges of all toes on the front paws, and sometimes the rear paws as well. Although no precise figures are available, peer- reviewed veterinary journal articles estimate that approximately 25% of domestic cats in North America have been declawed. Some privately owned apartment buildings in the U.S. ban cats unless they have been declawed. This is not the case in publicly subsidized housing, however, because in 2007 the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that forbids public housing authorities from having such rules. Laws have been passed in California (2012) and Rhode Island (2013) that ban landlords from requiring the declawing cats as a condition of occupancy. Some North American veterinarians hold the position that people with compromised immune systems, due to conditions such as AIDS, should have their cats declawed to prevent health risks to themselves. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control affirms declawing as an option, but acknowledges the controversy and offers the alternative of avoiding situations where scratching might occur. Similarly, the National Institute of Health (NIH) suggests avoiding rough play. Methods Onychectomy being performed Despite the prevalence of elective onychectomy in North America, no standard practices exist regarding the surgical techniques or surgical tools used, the administration of post-operative analgesics or other follow-up care, or the optimal age or other attributes of cats undergoing the procedure. There are three surgical methods: scalpel blade, guillotine trimmers, and laser. No technique or method has been proven to eliminate the many complications associated with declawing. The International Society of Feline Medicine states that \\"Even if future improvements in surgical techniques can negate some of the adverse effects associated with declawing, iCatCare and ISFM believe this procedure is unethical other than if required to manage a medical condition and should be banned.\\"https://icatcare.org/our-campaigns/declawing-of-cats- position-statement/ International Cat Care & International Society of Feline Medicine ‚Äì Position Statement on Declawing of Cats Recovery, health and behavioral effects Onychectomy is an orthopedic surgery involving 1 (or more) separate phalangeal amputations, which requires general anesthesia and multi-modal pain management before, during, and after surgery. A 2018 study by Martell-Moran, et al found, in a study of 274 cats, that \\"declawing cats increases the risk of unwanted behaviors and may increase risk for developing back pain. Evidence of inadequate surgical technique was common in the study population. Among declawed cats, retained P3 fragments further increased the risk of developing back pain and adverse behaviors. The use of optimal surgical technique does not eliminate the risk of adverse behavior subsequent to onychectomy.\\" The study found that inappropriate toileting, biting, aggression and overgrooming occurred significantly more often in the declawed cats than the non-declawed cats (roughly 7, 4, 3 and 3 times more often, respectively, based on the calculated odds ratio). A declawed cat was also almost 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with back pain than a non-declawed cat (potentially due to shortening of the declawed limb and altered gait, and/or chronic pain at the site of the surgery causing compensatory weight shift to the pelvic limbs).Nicole Martell-Moran, Mauricio Solano, Hugh Townsend.

At one veterinary teaching hospital, between 50 and 80% of cats had one or more medical complications post-surgery; 19.8% developed complications after release.Tobias KS. Feline onychectomy at a teaching institution: a retrospective study of 163 cases. Vet Surg 1994; 23:274-280. Other studies have reported medical post-op complication rates as 24% (Jankowski 1998), 53% (Martinez 1993), 1.4% (Pollari 1996),Pollari FL, Bonnett BN, Bamsey SC, et al. Postoperative complications of elective surgeries in dogs and cats determined by examining electronic and paper medical records. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996; 208: 1882-1886. 82.5% for blade and 51.5% for shear technique (Tobias 1994), and 80% (Yeon 2001). Reported medical complications include: pain, hemorrhage, laceration of paw pads, swelling, reluctance to bear weight on affected limb, neuropraxia (transient motor paralysis), radial nerve damage, lameness, infection, abscess, tissue necrosis, wound dehiscence, incomplete healing, protrusion of 2nd (middle) phalanx, claw regrowth, scurs (growth of deformed claw segments), retention of flexor process of third phalanx, chronic draining tracts, self-mutilation, dermatitis, lethargy, palmigrade stance (walking on wrists), chronic intermittent lameness, chronic pain syndrome, flexor tendon contracture, and cystitis (stress-associated bladder inflammation). Claw regrowth has been seen by veterinarians anywhere from weeks up to 15 years after onychectomy. In post-operation follow ups Yeon, et al. (2001) found six of thirty-nine cats (15%~) were house soiling and seven (18%) had increased biting frequency or intensity. The authors concluded based on this and previous studies that \\"behavioral problems following onychectomy were not pronounced\\". Follow-ups in this study were conducted an average of eleven and a half months after surgery.Yeon SC, Flanders JA, Scarlett JM, et al. Attitudes of owners regarding tendonectomy and onychectomy in cats. J Am Vet Med Assoc 2001;218:43-47.) Behavior problems are a primary cause of cats being relinquished to shelters. Proponents of declawing argue that declawing reduces undesired behaviors (scratching) and thus reduces the likelihood of relinquishment. Opponents of declawing argue the surgery itself creates more behavioral problems leading to relinquishment of cats. A study by Patronek et al. (1996) found in a univariate analysis that declawed cats were only 63% as likely to be relinquished as non-declawed cats. A multivariate analysis conducted in the same study shows odds of being relinquished to a shelter were 89% higher for declawed cats. The authors concluded that the conflicting results of the two analyses made it difficult to interpret the effects of declawing. In a shelter setting, more declawed cats were reported by their owners to have problems with inappropriate elimination (house soiling). However, this study ultimately found no association between the declaw status of cats and their aggression towards humans or frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).Patronek, GJ, Glickman LT, Beck AM, et al. \\"Risk factors for relinquishment of cats to an animal shelter\\". J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1996;209:582‚Äì588.Patronek GJ. \\"Assessment of claims of short- and long-term complications associated with onychectomy in cats\\". J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2001 Oct 1;219(7):932-937. In another study, 16% of declawed cats developed behavior problems (12% biting), and more declawed (55%) than clawed (45%) cats were referred to a vet teaching hospital for behavior problems. This was the second-longest follow-up period (2 years) ever examined.Bennett M, Houpt KA, Erb HN. Effects of declawing on feline behavior. Comp Anim Pract 1988;2:7-12. Patronek, Glickman and Beck (1996) found no association between the declaw status of cats and the frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).Patronek, GJ, Glickman LT, Beck AM, et al. Risk factors for relinquishment of cats to an animal shelter. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996;209:582‚Äì588. In another study of 275 cats, 11 cats (4%) developed or had worse behavior problems post-declawing; 5 clients (less than 1%) reported that their cats had developed litterbox and biting problems.Landsberg GM.

Feline behavior problems: the influence of declawing. Anthrozoos. 1989;3:50-53. Declawing practices Laws and policies governing onychectomy vary around the world. For example, many European countries prohibit or significantly restrict the practice, as do Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Turkey. It is banned in at least 22 countries. The list below gives an overview of the situation in different parts of the world. Australia In Australia, declawing has never been common, and for all practical purposes, does not exist. The practice is regulated at state level and there is an outright ban in many states, though not in New South Wales, where onychectomy is allowed in limited circumstance as an alternative to euthanasia. The Australian Veterinary Association's policy states: \\"Surgical alteration to the natural state of an animal is acceptable only if it is necessary for the health and welfare of the animal concerned. Performance of any surgical procedure for other than legitimate medical reasons is unacceptable.\\" Brazil In Brazil, declawing is not allowed by the Federal Council of Veterinary Medicine. Canada The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association officially opposes the practice of declawing, stating \\"We strongly oppose (declawing) because from an ethical viewpoint, the surgery is unacceptable. It offers no advantage to the cat\\" and that \\"It is evident that felines suffer needlessly when undergoing this surgery as an elective measure\\". However it is up to the veterinary regulators in each province to ban the practice. Declawing has been banned by the Veterinary Associations of seven out of ten Canadian provinces: Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, New Brunswick, and Manitoba. All of the Canadian prohibitions still allow for declawing-type procedures in the case of medical necessity to treat an injury, deformity or pathology affecting the animal. Israel In Israel, the Knesset Education Committee voted unanimously to send a bill banning the declawing of cats not for medical reasons. The bill has passed second and third readings on November 28, 2011, effectively making declawing a criminal offense with penalty of 1 year in prison or a fine of 75,000 Shekels. Europe In many European countries the practice is forbidden either under the terms of the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals or under local animal abuse laws, unless it is for \\"veterinary medical reasons or for the benefit of any particular animal\\". Some European countries go further, such as Finland, Sweden, Estonia, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, where declawing cats for non-medical reasons is always illegal under their laws against cruelty to animals. Austria In Austria, the Federal Act on the Protection of Animals, in Section 7, states, surgical procedures \\"carried out for other than therapeutic or diagnostic purposes ... are prohibited, in particular ... declawing.\\" United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, declawing was outlawed by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which explicitly prohibited \\"interference with the sensitive tissues or bone structure of the animal, otherwise than for the purposes of its medical treatment.\\" Even before the 2006 Act, however, declawing was extremely uncommon, to the extent that most people had never seen a declawed cat. The procedure was considered cruel by almost all British vets, who refused to perform it except on medical grounds. The Guide to Professional Conduct of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons stated that declawing was \\"only acceptable where, in the opinion of the veterinary surgeon, injury to the animal is likely to occur during normal activity. It is not acceptable if carried out for the convenience of the owner ... the removal of claws, particularly those which are weight bearing, to preclude damage to furnishings is not acceptable.\\" United States Declawing was outlawed in West Hollywood, California, in 2003, the first such ban in the U.S. The ordinance was authored by West Hollywood Councilmember John Duran and sponsored by The Paw Project, a non-profit organization started by Dr. Jennifer Conrad based in Santa Monica, California. The California Veterinary Medical Association challenged the law in court. The CVMA maintained that West Hollywood had overstepped its municipal authority by enacting an ordinance that infringed on licensed professionals' state-granted rights. It did not directly address declawing as an animal welfare issue. The CVMA initially prevailed in Superior Court, but in June 2007, the California Court of Appeal overturned the lower court ruling, thus reinstating the law banning declawing in West Hollywood. In 2004, California became the first state in the U.S. to enact a statewide ban on the declawing of wild and exotic cats. The bill was introduced by California Assemblymember Paul Koretz and sponsored by the Paw Project. In 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture enacted a ban on declawing of all wild and exotic animals held by USDA-licensed owners. In April 2007, the city of Norfolk, Virginia, the city of the headquarters of PETA, initially outlawed declawing, but the law was amended immediately to prohibit declawing only by persons other than veterinarians (Municipal Code Sec. 6.1-78.1). In 2009, the California state legislature approved a measure, sponsored by the California Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA), intended to stop other cities from passing bans similar to West Hollywood's. The bill included all professions licensed by the state Department of Consumer Affairs, and it was signed into law by the Governor in July 2009. However, the law's effective date, January 1, 2010, provided enough time for seven more California cities to pass Paw Project-sponsored local bans against the declawing of domestic cats: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Burbank, Santa Monica, Berkeley, Beverly Hills, and Culver City. In 2012, a California bill, authored by Senator Fran Pavley and sponsored by the Paw Project, was signed into law that prohibits landlords from requiring declawing and devocalization of animals as a condition of tenancy. In 2013, the state of Rhode Island enacted a law, similar to the California law, prohibiting landlords from requiring declawing as a condition of occupancy. Denver, Colorado, approved the first ban on declawing in a U.S. city outside California in November 2017. The effort was spearheaded by Aubrey Lavizzo, DVM, a veterinarian and Paw Project-Colorado Director. The ordinance was introduced by Denver City Councilmember Kendra Black. On July 22, 2019, New York became the first state to ban declawing except if necessary to treat a medical condition in the cat. In February 2020, Banfield, VCA, and BluePearl veterinary clinics announced that they would no longer offer elective declawing of cats. The decision applied to the over 2000 clinics in the US and Canada operated by Mars Veterinary Health, which employs over 10,000 veterinarians. Mars Veterinary Health is the largest owner of veterinary clinics in the United States and Canada. Dr. Jennifer Welser, Mars chief medical and quality officer, explained the decision in a statement: \\"At Mars Veterinary Health, we believe every pet deserves a safe, loving and supportive home that enables appropriate expression of natural behaviors. After careful consideration, medical leadership aligned on a new declaw position, and elective declaw surgery is no longer offered at U.S. Mars Veterinary Health practices.\\" The veterinarian-run, nonprofit organization, Paw Project, maintains a list of veterinary hospitals and clinics that will not offer declawing. =Ethical viewpoints on declawing in the US= Declawing is widely practiced but ethically controversial within the American veterinary community. Some American and Canadian veterinarians endorse the procedure, while some have criticized and refused to perform it. Two animal protection organizations in the U.S., the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, discourage the procedure. The Humane Society of the United States has supported legislation banning or restricting declawing. Multiple surveys and polls taken from 2011 reveal that the majority of U.S. cat owners are against declawing, believing the practice to be cruel. These surveys also suggest that the U.S. public believes that the majority of veterinarians who perform declawings only do so because it is a lucrative practice. The Founder and Director of the nonprofit Paw Project, Dr. Jennifer Conrad, was presented with the 2019 Gordon Stull Lifetime Achievement Award by the Humane Society Veterinary Medical association for her dedication to the ban of cat declawing. The Paw Project‚Äôs stated mission is to educate the public about the painful and crippling effects of feline declawing, to promote animal welfare through the abolition of the practice of declaw surgery, and to rehabilitate cats that have been declawed. The Paw Project has over forty veterinarian Directors representing states and provinces in the US and Canada. Opposition to attempts to ban or restrict declawing has come from veterinary trade organizations, such as the California Veterinary Medical Association. On the other hand, the American Veterinary Medical Association states that declawing \\"should be considered only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents a zoonotic risk for its owner(s).\\" Surveys suggest that 95% of declaw surgeries are done to protect furniture.Declaw Update, Pulse, Southern California Veterinary Medical Association, November 2009, p. 4 Alternatives to declawing=Surgical Tendonectomy involves cutting the deep digital flexor tendon of each claw, resulting in the cat being unable to move its distal phalanges. Without the ability to expose its claws, the cat is unable to wear down or groom its claws. For this reason, the cat subsequently requires regular nail clippings to prevent its claws from growing into its paw pads. A 1998 study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association comparing cats undergoing onychectomy to cats undergoing tendonectomy found that, although the cats undergoing tendonectomy appeared to suffer less pain immediately post-operatively, there was no significant difference in postoperative lameness, bleeding, or infection between the two groups. A 2005 study found no evidence that tendonectomy is less painful than onychectomy. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association explicitly do not recommend this surgery as an alternative to declawing. Non-surgical Cat with red nail caps According to board-certified veterinary behaviorist Dr. Gary Landsberg, \\"For most cats, appropriate client advice and a little effort is all that is needed to prevent scratching problems.\\"Veterinary Information Network, 2009 However, many veterinary practitioners are unwilling or unable to offer solutions to behavioral problems such as scratching, other than declawing. A non-surgical alternative to declawing is the application of vinyl nail caps that are affixed to the claws with nontoxic glue, requiring periodic replacement when the cat sheds its claw sheaths (usually every four to six weeks, depending on the cat's scratching habits). Other alternatives include regular nail trimming; directing scratching behavior to inexpensive cardboard scratchers or scratching posts, or emery scratching pads that dull the claws; rotary sanding devices; covering furniture or using double-sided sticky tape or sheets such as Sticky Paws; remote aversive devices such as Scat Mats; or acceptance of cats' scratching behavior.

She later commented that, On the ship travelling to Britain she appeared in children's theatrical productions, later saying of herself \\"I was a dreadful exhibitionist.\\" She attended Edgbaston College for Girls in Birmingham, Wycombe Abbey School, Buckinghamshire and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. She has had a long stage career beginning in the mid-1960s, and has regularly appeared in television dramas. Screen career Drake first gained wide attention for her portrayal of Lieutenant Gay Ellis in the 1970 science fiction television series UFO, in which her costume consisted of a silver suit and a purple wig. In the series, the character is the commander of the SHADO Moonbase, which is Earth's first line of defence against invading flying saucers. Drake appeared in roughly half the 26 episodes produced, leaving the series during a break in the production to pursue other acting opportunities. In 1971, Drake appeared in a short film entitled Crash!, based on a chapter in J. G. Ballard's book The Atrocity Exhibition. The film, directed by Harley Cokeliss, featured Ballard talking about the ideas in his book. Drake appeared as a passenger and car-crash victim. Ballard later developed the idea into his 1973 novel Crash.Baxter, John, Chapter 34, \\"The Nasty\\", The Inner Man: The Life of J.G. Ballard, Hachette, 2011. In his draft of the novel he mentioned Drake by name, but references to her were removed from the published version. In the 2009 BBC documentary Synth Britannia clips of Ballard and Drake from Crash! were inserted into the 1979 video for Gary Numan's song \\"Cars\\". A reviewer in The Scotsman commented that the presence of Drake \\"brought serious glamour to urban alienation\\". In the early 1970s, Drake was associated with the boom in British sexploitation movies, repeatedly appearing nude or topless. She played a nude artist's model in the 1970 film Connecting Rooms, and was one of Peter Sellers' conquests in the film There's a Girl in My Soup. She also played one of the lead roles in the sex comedy Au Pair Girls (1972) and appeared in two Derek Ford films, Suburban Wives (1971) and its sequel Commuter Husbands (1972), in which she played the narrator who links the disparate episodes together. Her early television appearances include The Avengers (1967), Coronation Street (as Inga Olsen in 1967) and The Saint (1968). In 1970, she auditioned for the part of Jo Grant in Doctor Who, reaching the final shortlist of three, but did not get the part. She gained wide exposure in The Brothers, the hit BBC family drama series, in which she appeared as a regular for the first four seasons playing Jill, the girlfriend (and later wife) of David Hammond. She also appeared in an episode of Brian Clemens' 1970s series Thriller, in The Kelly Monteith Show (as Monteith's wife 1979-80), a television version of The Importance of Being Earnest (1985, for LWT/PBS), Crossroads (1985-87, as motel boss Nicola Freeman) and returned to Coronation Street in 2009 as Vanessa. In The Inspector Lynley Mysteries (2003-05) she played the protagonist's mother. She was the subject of This Is Your Life on 8 April 1987. Stage career Drake made her stage debut in 1964, during the inaugural season of the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, playing Cecily in The Importance of Being Earnest. In 1966, she joined the Birmingham Repertory Company and played Queen Isabella in Marlowe's Edward II.Aebischer and Prince, \\"Performing Early Modern Drama Today\\", Cambridge University Press, 2012, p197 She also had roles in Private Lives (with Renee Asherson), The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles (with Linda Marlowe and Patrick Mower), Twelfth Night and Inadmissible Evidence.Sir Barry Jackson and Birmingham Repertory Theatre Archive 1913-1970 The following year, she was Roxanne in Cyrano de Bergerac at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park.Review, John Higgins, The Spectator, 21 July 1967 In the 1974‚Äì5, season at the Bristol Old Vic, she played in Cowardy Custard, a devised entertainment featuring the words and music of No√´l Coward.University of Bristol Theatre Collection online In 1975, she appeared as Madeline Bassett in the original London cast of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn musical Jeeves.

She can be heard accompanying her brother Nick on a number of songs that he recorded privately, and which have since been released on the album Family Tree. After the release of songs written and performed by her mother, she said \\"Her creativity was a personal thing, and she was lucky to be able to develop it in an environment where that side of her was totally accepted. Indeed, my father encouraged it. He was so proud of her. On one occasion, he even made the 20-mile drive to Birmingham to get four songs pressed onto a disc.\\" In 2014, she published Nick Drake: Remembered for a While, a memoir of her brother. In April 2018, she collected the Hall of Fame Folk Award 2018 on her brother's behalf in Belfast. She lives in Wenlock Abbey in Much Wenlock, Shropshire, in a house she bought in 1983 with her husband, South African-born artist Louis de Wet, who died in 2018. They renovated their home over several years as an artistic project and, in 2004, he described it as \\"the most beautiful building site in the world\\".

As a result of the destruction in Florida, the hurricane represented an early start to the Great Depression in the aftermath of the state's 1920s land boom. It has been estimated that a similar hurricane would cause about $235 billion in damage if it were to hit Miami in 2018. The tropical cyclone is believed to have formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on September 11\\\\. Steadily strengthening as it tracked west- northwestward, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity the next day. As a result of scattered observations at open sea, however, no ship encountered the storm until September 15, by which time the cyclone had reached major hurricane intensity north of the Virgin Islands. Strengthening continued up until the following day, when the storm reached peak intensity with a strength equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. This intensity was maintained as the storm tracked across the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas to landfall near Miami on September 18\\\\. The cyclone caused immense destruction throughout the islands and across southern Florida. The storm destroyed hundreds of structures in its path over the islands, leaving thousands of residents homeless. At least 17 deaths occurred on the islands, though many others‚Äîsome related only indirectly to the storm‚Äîwere reported in the aftermath. Upon striking South Florida, the cyclone generated hurricane-force winds over a broad swath of the region, causing widespread and severe structural damage from both wind and water. Most of the deaths occurred near Lake Okeechobee, when a large storm surge breached muck dikes and drowned hundreds of people. The hurricane quickly traversed the Florida peninsula before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Fort Myers. The storm flooded surrounding communities and barrier islands, while strong winds downed trees and disrupted electrical service. The storm later made two landfalls with weaker intensities on Alabama and Mississippi on September 20 and 21, respectively. The storm caused additional but less severe damage in those states, primarily from heavy rains and storm surge. Land interaction caused the cyclone to deteriorate and later dissipate on September 22\\\\. Meteorological history Due to the sparseness of available observations in the central Atlantic, the specific origins of the 1926 Miami hurricane remain unclear. Operationally, the United States Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C., did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until September 14. However, the tropical cyclone is first listed in HURDAT‚Äîthe official Atlantic hurricane database‚Äîas having begun as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of roughly east of the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on September 11\\\\. Tracking west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified and reached hurricane intensity on September 12 while still east of the Lesser Antilles. The observation of low barometric pressures and winds suggesting cyclonic rotation at Saint Kitts on the evening of September 14 was the first to suggest that a hurricane had developed. The following day, the steamship Matura encountered the strengthening tropical cyclone and documented a minimum pressure of . By 06:00 UTC on September 15, the storm had strengthened further to major hurricane intensity north of the Virgin Islands. Strengthening continued into September 16 as the hurricane reached a strength equivalent to that of a Category 4 on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Although no official minimum pressure readings were taken in the area at the time, the tropical cyclone peaked in wind-based intensity at 18:00 UTC on September 16 with sustained winds of , near the uppermost limit of the modern-day ranking Category 4. With this strength the hurricane passed near the Turks and Caicos Islands, though its intensity at the time was based on the extent of damage there as any measurement device was knocked out by the damaging winds. Shortly afterward, the cyclone struck the Bahamian island of Mayaguana at its peak intensity. After passing the island, the hurricane slightly weakened but maintained formidable strength as it accelerated through the southern Bahamas, passing near Nassau on September 17. The storm then made a second landfall on Andros Island in the Mangrove Cay district early on September 18\\\\. Thereafter, the hurricane crossed Andros Island and passed over the Gulf Stream en route to Florida. This trajectory brought the storm ashore on the coast of South Florida near Perrine, located just south of Downtown Miami, before 12:00 UTC on September 18 with winds of and a minimum pressure estimated at . At the time, the hurricane was very large in size, with a radius of outermost closed isobar across; hurricane-force winds were reported from the upper Florida Keys to near St. Lucie County. Around 20:30 UTC, the eye of the hurricane passed into the Gulf of Mexico near Punta Rassa; though by that time the pressure in the eye had only risen to , the winds in the eye wall had decreased to . The hurricane had weakened over South Florida as a result of land interaction, but re-strengthened after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico off Punta Rassa six hours later. The warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed for the tropical cyclone to reach a secondary peak intensity with winds of on September 20, equivalent to that of a modern-day high-end Category 3 hurricane. Although the storm had taken a more northwesterly course through the gulf, the hurricane later began paralleling the coast of the Florida Panhandle and thus slowly curved westward. As a result, the major hurricane, now weakening quickly, made its second landfall near Perdido Beach, Alabama, at around 21:30 UTC that day with winds of . After landfall, the storm quickly weakened and meandered off of Alabama's barrier islands, eventually moving ashore for the last time on September 21 near Gulfport, Mississippi, as a tropical storm. The cyclone continued its decay inland, degenerating into a tropical depression the following day before dissipating over Louisiana shortly thereafter. Preparations On September 16, the United States Weather Bureau advised caution to ships tracking in Bahamian waters and the Florida Strait. The first tropical cyclone warning associated with the storm was a northeast storm warning issued on September 17 for the Florida coast from Jupiter Inlet to Key West, Florida. Warnings along the United States Eastern Seaboard eventually stretched as far north as Charleston, South Carolina, upon the storm's first landfall. Additional warnings were posted for the United States Gulf Coast on September 19 and covered coastal areas from Apalachicola, Florida, to Burrwood, Louisiana. Information on the storm as ascertained by the U.S. Weather Bureau was relayed by various radio and local press services, though the bureau specifically acknowledged the Mobile Register for their efforts in disseminating storm details. Impact=Turks and Caicos and Bahamas Although no fatalities were reported, the hurricane wrought extensive property damage to Grand Turk Island. Rain gauges recorded of rain during the storm, and high surf left knee-deep sand drifts on the island. The ocean covered the land up to inland, and winds unroofed buildings at the weather station. Reportedly, the winds even ripped spines from prickly pear cacti. Nearly all lighters at port were lost. The storm left 4,000 people homeless on three of the islands in the Turks and Caicos. Due to hampered communication, the extent of damage in the Bahamas was initially unclear. In the Bahamas, the storm flattened hundreds of structures and killed at least 17 people, mostly on Bimini, where seven people died and the greatest property damage occurred. The hurricane also leveled many structures on Andros, including churches and large buildings, and downed trees and other homes on New Providence. United States The 1926 hurricane is known primarily for its impacts and lasting aftermath in South Florida, particularly in the Miami area. Effects were concentrated around Florida's southeastern coast and south-central Florida, with additional impacts in Northwest Florida. Damage figures from the storm in the state alone reached US$75 million and accounted for most of the damage that the tropical cyclone produced. Although the official number of fatalities would later be revised downward, initial estimates suggested that the death toll would likely be over 1,000 in Miami alone with an additional 2,000 injured. Nonetheless, the grave number of casualties forced resorts to serve as temporary morgues and hospitals. Homes and office buildings were used to serve as refugee camps for the approximately 38,000 people displaced by the hurricane. =Miami metropolitan area= The storm surge in South Florida was not as high as it would have been had the hurricane struck another area, owing to the deep offshore continental shelf, which increased the energy needed to sustain a large surge. However, along Biscayne Bay, the hurricane produced a substantial storm surge; visual estimates suggested a peak height of in Coconut Grove, and a value of occurred at Dinner Key, equal to the observation at Biscayne Boulevard in Downtown Miami. In fact, the storm surge measured in the 1926 hurricane was the highest ever officially documented on the east coast of South Florida until observers recorded a height of at the Burger King International Headquarters near Cutler in Dade County during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The hurricane's high storm surge swept into Miami and Miami Beach, flooding city streets with knee-deep water. Yachts and large vessels were carried by the intense wind and waves onto shore. The MacArthur Causeway connecting Miami and Miami Beach was submerged under of water. Communication between the two locales as well as the rest of the United States was cut after all local telecommunications and power lines were blown down. Due to their susceptibility to strong winds, most wooden buildings in Miami were either blown down or lost their roofs. Concrete and steel buildings were warped at their bases. While skyscrapers mostly sustained minor damage, the 18-story Meyer-Kiser Building bore considerable damage. The structure reportedly swayed and vibrated precipitously during the storm; eyewitnesses likened it to the Charleston dance. Many of the injuries in the city were due to ballistic fragments of broken roofing including iron sheeting. Other structures across the region sustained significant damage. Strong winds leveled \\"hundreds\\" of working-class homes in Hialeah and severely damaged 70% of the town. Winds destroyed the interiors of buildings in Fort Lauderdale, the seat of Broward County, and ripped the roof from the Broward County courthouse. Despite having only 12,000 inhabitants, the town sustained severe damage to 3,500 of its buildings. Nearby, the storm severely damaged the abandoned New River House of Refuge. Cities as far north as Lake Park (then called Kelsey City) and West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County reported many roofs blown off, numerous small buildings destroyed, walls blown down, windows shattered, and trees, shrubs, and other objects torn apart or uprooted. The worst destruction occurred in the poorer, mostly black sections of the towns, where many homes were destroyed. Remains of a bridge at Baker's Haulover Inlet Along the east coast of South Florida, the storm caused widespread, significant beach erosion. At Hillsboro Inlet Light, high tides removed of sand beneath the lighthouse. The hurricane swept away much of State Road A1A in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties. The combined force of waves and storm surge undermined coastal structures that collapsed, including multi-story casinos on Miami Beach, and washed out the coastal bridge on Florida State Road A1A at Baker's Haulover Inlet. In Boca Raton, waves were so large that they rose to the top of the high ridge on the barrier island, though they did not overtop it. High surf also destroyed a casino at the Boca Raton Inlet. \\"Knee-deep\\" water east of U.S. Route 1 (Federal Highway) in Boca Raton blocked beach access, but residents waded through. Meanwhile, large waves left much debris and sand drifts several feet deep on State Road A1A in Delray Beach. The waters of the Lake Worth Lagoon overflowed their banks, submerging nearby streets, parks, and golf courses. High tides piled debris on the streets of Palm Beach, caused a beachfront boardwalk to collapse, and exacerbated previous damage from the July hurricane. On Hollywood beach, waves smashed windows and invaded the interior of the Hollywood Beach Hotel. People on the second floor found sand drifts reaching \\"half way to the ceiling.\\" The storm also ravaged entertainment venues and historic sites. The storm flattened the Fulford‚ÄìMiami Speedway in North Miami Beach, which then ceased operation. Winds peeled into pieces the roof of the grandstand at Hialeah Race Track and destroyed the kennels, allowing racing greyhounds to escape. The storm wrecked prominent restaurants and tourist attractions on Miami Beach, including the Million Dollar Pier. Many historic structures throughout South Florida sustained significant damage, including the Barnacle and the Villa Vizcaya where the yacht Nepenthe and fishing boat Psyche. were sunk. The storm damaged the main residence at the Bonnet House‚Äîthe only hurricane to do so since it was first built. No other storm since 1926 caused a similar level of destruction to the property until Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The storm ruined cultivated areas throughout South Florida. The storm flooded the surrounding citrus crop and agricultural fields south of Miami, particularly near Homestead and Florida City, destroying half of the citrus-bearing trees in the area. Much of the citrus crop in Dania was a total loss as floodwaters submerged the area to depths of ; flooding lingered for more than a week after the storm. =Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, and Southwest Florida= A storm surge from Lake Okeechobee entirely inundated Clewiston, reportedly leaving numerous bodies along the road connecting the city with Miami. Further inland, the surge burst through frail, earthen, tall muck dikes, submerging Moore Haven under of water. Residents scrambled, often unsuccessfully, to safety on rooftops but were swept away by the winds and storm surge. A nearby drainage dam was destroyed, causing additional flooding of the countryside. Most of the city's buildings were swept off of their original foundations. Reports by the Red Cross and local authorities indicated that 150 human corpses were found in Moore Haven alone; their estimates were incomplete as many bodies were never found, reportedly having been swept deep into the Everglades. Estimates of the dead near Lake Okeechobee ranged as high as 300. Two years later, another Category 4 hurricane killed at least 2,500 people along Lake Okeechobee, but mostly affected the eastern shore, leaving Moore Haven largely unscathed. The Gulf Coast of the Florida peninsula saw comparatively less damage compared to Greater Miami but still suffered significant impacts. A peak storm tide of affected Punta Rassa and the islands of Captiva and Sanibel, causing $3,000,000 in flood damage. The storm opened Redfish Pass between Captiva and North Captiva islands. Between Tampa and Naples, strong winds destroyed windows and felled trees and power poles. In Fort Myers, citrus crops sustained some damage and public utilities were put out of commission. Strong winds uprooted trees in St. Petersburg, while heavy rainfall caused flooding in the outlying districts of nearby Tampa. South of the eye, a storm tide of submerged the streets of Everglades City, forcing people into the upper stories of buildings. Homes that were not secured to their foundations floated away on the tide. Tides reached as far south as Flamingo, sending seaweed, fish, and mud into dwellings. =Florida Panhandle and elsewhere= Although the hurricane weakened before striking the upper Gulf Coast, its slow movement produced substantial effects to coastal regions between Mobile and Pensacola; these areas experienced heavy damage from wind, rain, and storm surge. Wind records at Pensacola indicate that the city encountered sustained winds of hurricane force for more than 20 hours, including winds above for five hours. The storm tide destroyed nearly all waterfront structures on Pensacola Bay and peaked at near Bagdad, Florida. Rainfall maximized at Bay Minette, Alabama, where fell. Aftermath The disarray in Miami following the hurricane's passage led to a breakout of looting in the city's African-American districts that resulted in seven arrests. This unrest prompted the declaration of martial law with the swearing-in of 300 special policemen for voluntary duty. Similarly, 200 policemen were placed on duty in Hollywood, Florida. After a survey indicated that the available food and water supplies would only last 30 days, hoarding was banned. Soup kitchens were set up in Miami's business district in order to serve food to the recently displaced and as a source for clean drinking water that was contaminated in other areas. The first aid arriving from outside the impacted areas was a relief train guarded by state militiamen that carted medical staff, medicine, potable water, and other relief supplies into Miami immediately following the storm's passage. Afterwards, then-U.S. president Calvin Coolidge placed the United States Army and Coast Guard on standby should relief efforts necessitate their presence in Florida and the Bahamas. The Red Cross offered its facilities and the Pullman Company offered its resources for use in relief efforts. The National Guard of the United States dispatched several companies of guardsmen to disaster areas following urgent appeals from then-Florida governor John W. Martin. In response to the widespread destruction of buildings on Miami Beach, John J. Farrey was appointed chief building, plumbing and electrical inspector. He initiated and enforced the first building code in the United States, which more than 5,000 US cities duplicated.Great Floridians 2000 Project According to the American Red Cross, the storm caused 372 fatalities, including 114 from the city of Miami, but these totals apparently do not include deaths outside the United States. Prior to 2003, the National Weather Service had long accepted 243 as the number of deaths, but historical research indicated that this total was far too low. The NWS then updated its totals to reflect the new findings. Even the estimates for the United States are uncertain and vary, since there were many people, especially transients and colored migrants in South Florida, listed as \\"missing\\". About 43,000 people were left homeless, mostly in the Miami area. The toll for the storm in the United States was $100 million ($ USD). It is estimated that if an identical storm hit in the year 2005, with modern development and prices, the storm would have caused $140‚Äì157 billion in damage ($196 billion in 2016); this would make the storm the costliest on record in the United States, adjusted for inflation, if it were to occur in contemporary times. Several events, including the sinking of a ship in the Miami harbor and an embargo by the Florida East Coast Railroad before the storm, weakened the Florida land boom of the 1920s in South Florida. However, the storm is considered the final blow to end the boom locally. Thousands of newcomers to Florida left the state and cleared their bank accounts, leaving many banks to the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, the Great Depression of 1929 did not make a great impact to Florida unlike the rest of the country. Many planned developments, which had fallen into deadlock due to insufficient resources, were abandoned due to the economic effects of the hurricane. In Boca Raton, for instance, one planned community by Addison Mizner, called Villa Rica, was destroyed by the hurricane and never rebuilt. South Florida did not achieve full economic recovery until the 1940s. The University of Miami, located in Coral Gables, had been founded in 1925 and opened its doors for the first time just days after the hurricane passed. The university's athletic teams were nicknamed the Hurricanes in memory of this catastrophe. The school's mascot is Sebastian, an ibis. The ibis is a small white bird that can be seen around South Florida, including on the UM campus. According to folklore, the ibis is the last bird to leave before a hurricane strikes and the first to return after the storm, hence its selection for the school mascot.

In 1939 he was drafted for the Polish army, then arrested by the Soviets, spent some time in a jail in Polatsk, eventually sentenced to 10 years and sent away to Komi. As a citizen of Poland, he was released under the terms of Sikorski- Mayski Agreement and travelled to Samarkand in September 1941. There he joined the Polish Army in the East, being formed under command of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, just like hundreds of other Belarusians from Western Belarus (Kresy). He spent the rest of the war fighting in General Anders' Polish II Corps. He was wounded four times, and was a participant of the famous Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war he spent some time in England before moving to Munich, Germany in 1951 where he started publishing a magazine in Belarusian. In 1954 he became one of the first employees of the newly opened Belarus Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He wrote the script of the stations' first radio programme in Belarusian language and was aired on May 20, 1954. The piece; \\"Azimuth of the Heart\\" was an exhortation and greeting to Belarusian people under Soviet rule \\"from the compatriots in the free world.\\" In 1960's several years before his death, he started writing a memoir about the Belarusian soldiers at the Battle of Monte Cassino. According to various estimates, there were 1000-2000 Belarusians in this battle and about 200-250 of them were killed in action. The novel was called \\"Death and nightingales\\" (–°—å–º–µ—Ä—Ü—å —ñ —Å–∞–ª–∞—û—ñ). It was published in installments in the Belarusian magazine in Munich \\"Backaushchyna\\" from 1962-1963. The book was not completely finished though by Piotra Sych as he unexpectedly died at the age of 51. His wife Elza helped to prepare and publish it as a separate book several years after his death.

Biography  Rocke Robertson was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1912. He studied in Switzerland before moving to Montreal in 1929 to attend McGill University, where he received his B.S. in 1932 and M.D. in 1936. He married Beatrice \\"Rolly\\" Rosalyn Arnold in 1937, and the couple would go on to have four children: Tam, Ian, Bea and Stuart. Following an internship at Montreal General Hospital and fellowship at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Robertson enlisted with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. He served in World War II, first in England, where he commanded surgical units in the field, and then as part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Robertson returned to British Columbia when he was put in charge of surgery at the Vancouver Military Hospital and Shaughnessy Veteran's Hospital in 1944. After the war, in 1950, he became the first Professor and Chair of the Department of Surgery at the University of British Columbia, where he played a major role in the founding of their medical school. In 1959, Robertson became Surgeon-in-Chief at Montreal General Hospital, where he oversaw the creation of the University Surgical Clinic, developed a Surgical Intensive Care Unit and was named Chairman of Surgery. Robertson invented the trauma team while working at the hospital, and remained there until being appointed Principal of McGill in 1962. He was the first physician and the first McGill University graduate to serve as its Principal and Vice Chancellor. During his time as Principal, the university was undergoing rapid expansion, both in physical size and in the numbers of staff and students. However, Quebec in the 1960s saw a resurgence of conflicts surrounding Quebec nationalism, and the university saw student demonstrations and protests throughout Robertson's leadership. In response, Robertson introduced an important policy that permitted students to submit papers and exams in French. He received honorary degrees from many universities: Bishop's University, University of Manitoba, University of Toronto, University of Victoria (1964), University of Glasgow, University of British Columbia (1964), Universit√© de Montr√©al, University of Michigan, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Memorial University (1968) and Sir George Williams University (1971), which later became Concordia University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1968 and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1969. He was also a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, the American College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1969, shortly before he retired as McGill's principal, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. A prolific writer, Robertson also had a passion for lexicography and for collecting rare English dictionaries. When he died in his 86th year, he left behind his beloved wife Rolly and their four children. His archive is held at the McGill University Archives.

A gas stove is a stove that is fuelled by combustible gas such as syngas, natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas or other flammable gas. Before the advent of gas, cooking stoves relied on solid fuels such as coal or wood. The first gas stoves were developed in the 1820s and a gas stove factory was established in England in 1836. This new cooking technology had the advantage of being easily adjustable and could be turned off when not in use. The gas stove, however, did not become a commercial success until the 1880s, by which time supplies of piped gas were available in cities and large towns in Britain. The stoves became widespread on the European Continent and in the United States in the early 20th century. Gas stoves became more wieldy when the oven was integrated into the base and the size was reduced to better fit in with the rest of the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of continually consuming gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs (cooktops) and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.  History  Early gas stoves produced by Windsor. From Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1904. The first gas stove was developed on 8 March 1802 by Zach√§us Winzler (de), but this along with other attempts remained isolated experiments. James Sharp patented a gas stove in Northampton, England in 1826 and opened a gas stove factory in 1836. His invention was marketed by the firm Smith & Philips from 1828. An important figure in the early acceptance of this new technology, was Alexis Soyer, the renowned chef at the Reform Club in London. From 1841, he converted his kitchen to consume piped gas, arguing that gas was cheaper overall because the supply could be turned off when the stove was not in use. A gas stove was shown at the World Fair in London in 1851, but it was only in the 1880s that the technology became a commercial success in England. By that stage a large and reliable network for gas pipeline transport had spread over much of the country, making gas relatively cheap and efficient for domestic use. Gas stoves only became widespread on the European Continent and in the United States in the early 20th century. Early gas stoves were rather unwieldy, but soon the oven was integrated into the base and the size was reduced to fit in better with the rest of the kitchen furniture. In the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning.  Ignition  Electric ignition spark Gas stoves today use two basic types of ignition sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame is between the front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs (cooktops) and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. Although most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, many households have gas cooking ranges and ovens that need to be lit with a flame. Electric ignition stoves use electric sparks to ignite the surface burners. This is the \\"clicking sound\\" audible just before the burner actually lights. The sparks are initiated by turning the gas burner knob to a position typically labeled \\"LITE\\" or by pressing the 'ignition' button. Once the burner lights, the knob is turned further to modulate the flame size. Auto reignition is an elegant refinement: the user need not know or understand the wait-then-turn sequence. They simply turn the burner knob to the desired flame size and the sparking is turned off automatically when the flame lights. Auto reignition also provides a safety feature: the flame will be automatically reignited if the flame goes out while the gas is still on‚Äîfor example by a gust of wind. If the power fails, surface burners must be manually match-lit. Electric ignition for ovens uses a \\"hot surface\\" or \\"glow bar\\" ignitor. Basically it is a heating element that heats up to gas's ignition temperature. A sensor detects when the glow bar is hot enough and opens the gas valve. Also stoves with electric ignition must be connected with gas protection mechanisms such as gas control breaker. Because of this many manufacturers supply stoves without electricity plug.  Features of a gas stove = 1. Burner heat  One of the important aspects of a gas stove is heat emitted by the burners. Usually, burner heat is calculated in terms of BTU's (British Thermal Units). All the burners of a gas stove don't have equal and maximum heat output. Depending on the number of burners, some of the gas cooktops have one or two burners that have high heat capability ‚Äì which is often around 12,000 BTU. For example, a burner with the heat capability of 12,000 BTU will be hot enough for cooking in a wok. And one of the burners is deliberately kept at low end of heat, which is around 5,000 BTU. This low range is perfect for cooking dishes that don't require high heat. Some high end cooktop models provide higher range of heat and heavy-duty burners that can go up to 20,000 BTU or even more. Based on what type of cooking you are handling; the higher heat capability burners can be either a beneficial aspect or complete waste of money.  2. Design and layout  In the last few years, appliance manufacturers have been making innovative changes to the design and layout of gas stoves. Most of the modern cooktops have come with lattice structure which usually covers the complete range of the top, enabling sliding of cookware from one burner to another without lifting the containers over the gaps of cooktop. Some modern gas stoves also have central fifth burner or an integrated griddle in between the outer burners.  3. Size  The size of a kitchen gas stove usually ranges from 30‚Äù to even 42‚Äù (industrial models). Almost all the manufacturers have been developing several range of options in size range. Combination of range and oven are also available which usually come in two styles: slide in and freestanding. A gas stove in a San Francisco apartment, 1975. Usually, there isn't much of a style difference in between them. Slide-in come with lips on their either side and controls over the front along with burner controls. Freestanding gas range cooktops have solid slides and controls placed behind the cooktop.  4. Oven  Many stoves have integrated ovens. Modern ovens often include a convection fan inside the oven to provide even air circulation and lets the food cook evenly. Some modern ovens come with temperature sensors which allows close control of baking, automatically shut off after reaching certain temperature, or hold on to particular temperature through the cooking process. Ovens may also have two separate oven bays which allows cooking of two different dishes at the same time.  5. Programmable controls  Many gas stoves come with at least few modern programmable controls to make the handling easier. LCD displays and some other complex cooking routines are some of the standard features present in most of the basic and high-end manufacturing models. Some of the other programmable controls include precise pre-heating, automatic pizza, cook timers and others.  6. Safety factors  Modern gas stove ranges are safer than older models. Two of the major safety concerns with gas stoves are child-safe controls and accidental ignition. Some gas cooktops have knobs which can be accidentally switched on even with a gentle bump.

Some may have a thermostat.http://www.walmart.com/ip/GE-Dual-Burner-Hot-Plate/12442588 History On September 20, 1859, George B. Simpson was awarded US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater' surface heated by a platinum-wire coil powered by batteries. In his words, useful to \\"warm rooms, boil water, cook victuals...\\". Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn filed patent number no. 39916 in 1892 for an \\"Electric Oven,\\" a device he probably employed in preparing a meal for an Ottawa hotel that year. Ahearn and Warren Y. Soper were owners of Ottawa's Chaudiere Electric Light and Power Company. The electric stove was showcased at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, where an electrified model kitchen was shown. Unlike the gas stove, the electrical stove was slow to catch on, partly due to the unfamiliar technology, and the need for cities and towns to be electrified. By the 1930s, the technology had matured and the electrical stove slowly began to replace the gas stove, especially in household kitchens. In 1897, William Hadaway was granted US patent # 574537 for an \\"Automatically Controlled Electric Oven\\". Drawings submitted on 29 November 1905 when David Curle Smith obtained an Australian patent (No. 4699/05) for his \\"electric cooking stove\\", also known as \\"The Kalgoorlie Stove\\". Early electric stoves were unsatisfactory due to the cost of electricity (compared with wood, coal, or city gas), limited power available from the electrical supply company, poor temperature regulation, and short life of heating elements. The invention of nichrome alloy for resistance wires improved the cost and durability of heating elements.Ed Sobey, The Way Kitchens Work, Chicago Review Press, 2010 , page viii In the United States, even though three companies had introduced electric stoves in 1908, penetration was rare; an electric stove was still considered a novelty in the 1920s. By the 1930s, decreased cost of electric power and modernized styling of electric stoves had greatly increased their acceptance.Andrew F. Smith (ed.) The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink,Oxford University Press, 2007 p.564 Electric stoves and other household appliances were marketed by electrical utilities to build demand for electric power. During the expansion of rural electrification, demonstrations of cooking on an electric stove were popular.Howard Hampton Public Power: Energy Production in the 21st Century Insomniac Press, 2003 pages 59-61  Kalgoorlie Stove  In November 1905, David Curle Smith, the Municipal Electrical Engineer of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, applied for a patent (Aust Patent No 4699/05) for a device that adopted (following the design of gas stoves) what later became the configuration for most electric stoves: an oven surmounted by a hotplate with a grill tray between them. Curle Smith's stove did not have a thermostat; heat was controlled by the number of the appliance‚Äôs nine elements that were switched on.Introduction by H. A. Willis, Thermo-Electrical Cooking Made Easy, Hesperian Press, 2011, p. 24 After the patent was granted in 1906, manufacturing of Curle Smith's design commenced in October of that year. The entire production run was acquired by the electricity supply department of Kalgoorlie Municipality, which hired out the stoves to residents. About 50 appliances were produced before cost overruns became a factor in Council politics and the project was suspended. This seems to have been the first time household electric stoves were produced with the express purpose of bringing \\"cooking by electricity ... within the reach of anyone\\". There are no extant examples of this stove, many of which were salvaged for their copper content during WWI.Introduction by H. A. Willis, Thermo-Electrical Cooking Made Easy, Hesperian Press, 2011, pp. 3‚Äì17 To promote the stove, David Curle Smith's wife, H. Nora Curle Smith (n√©e Helen Nora Murdoch, and a member of the Murdoch family prominent in Australian public life), wrote a cookbook containing operating instructions and 161 recipes. Thermo-Electrical Cooking Made Easy, published in March 1907, is therefore the world's first cookbook for electric stoves.Introduction by H. A. Willis,  Variants  A glass-ceramic cooktop (2005) The first technology used resistive heating coils which heated iron hotplates, on top of which the pots were placed.For example, US Patent 1,637,155 Electric Stove, J.E. Marsden, issued July 26, 1927 This was subsequently developed into a spiral hollow steel tube that had a heating element running through the middle. The tube was wound in a spiral underneath the pan. Unlike the earlier iron hotplate the steel spiral was heated to red heat imparting more heat to the pan than the hotplate could. In the 1970s, glass-ceramic cooktops started to appear. Glass-ceramic has very low thermal conductivity, a coefficient of thermal expansion of practically zero, but lets infrared radiation pass very well. Electrical heating coils or infrared halogen lamps are used as heating elements. Because of its physical characteristics, the cooktop heats more quickly, less afterheat remains, and only the plate heats up while the adjacent surface remains cool. Also, these cooktops have a smooth surface and are thus easier to clean, but are markedly more expensive. A third technology‚Äîdeveloped first for professional kitchens, but today also entering the domestic market‚Äîis induction cooking. This process has hitherto only heated ferromagnetic cookware directly through electromagnetic induction.Rusty L. Myers The Basics of Physics Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 page 267 Recent developments have enabled non ferrous cookware to work as well, but not as efficiently as ferrous.Tecnik TKG8725u User manual Induction stoves also have a smooth glass-ceramic surface.

It involves the simultaneous purchase of convertible securities and the short sale of the same issuer's common stock. The premise of the strategy is that the convertible is sometimes priced inefficiently relative to the underlying stock, for reasons that range from illiquidity to market psychology. In particular, the equity option embedded in the convertible bond may be a source of cheap volatility, which convertible arbitrageurs can then exploit. The number of shares sold short usually reflects a delta-neutral or market-neutral ratio. As a result, under normal market conditions, the arbitrageur expects the combined position to be insensitive to small fluctuations in the price of the underlying stock. However, maintaining a market-neutral position may require rebalancing transactions, a process called dynamic delta hedging. This rebalancing adds to the return of convertible arbitrage strategies. Risks As with most successful arbitrage strategies, convertible arbitrage has attracted a large number of market participants, creating intense competition and reducing the effectiveness of the strategy. For example, many convertible arbitrageurs suffered losses in early 2005 when the credit of General Motors was downgraded at the same time Kirk Kerkorian was making an offer for GM's stock. Since most arbitrageurs were long GM debt and short the equity, they were hurt on both sides. Going back a lot further, many such \\"arbs\\" sustained big losses in the so-called \\"crash of '87\\". In theory, when a stock declines, the associated convertible bond will decline less, because it is protected by its value as a fixed-income instrument: it pays interest periodically. In the 1987 stock market crash, however, many convertible bonds declined more than the stocks into which they were convertible, apparently for liquidity reasons, with the market for the stocks being much more liquid than the relatively small market for the bonds. Arbitrageurs who relied on the traditional relationship between stock and bond gained less from their short stock positions than they lost on their long bond positions.  Controversy  In the past, most people in the market believed that convertible bond arbitrage was mainly due to convertible underpricing. However, recent studies find empirical evidence that convertible bonds usually generate relatively large positive gammas that can make delta-neutral portfolios highly profitable. Other research suggests that arbitrageurs in general take advantage of illiquidity and higher volatility.

Based on the company's two-seat Robinson R22, the R44 features hydraulically assisted flight controls. It was first flown on 31 March 1990 and received FAA certification in December 1992, with the first delivery in February 1993. The R44 has been the world's best-selling general aviation (GA) helicopter every year since 1999. It is one of the most-produced GA aircraft of the 21st century, with 5,941 deliveries from 2001‚Äì2020. Design The R44 is a single-engined helicopter with a semi-rigid two-bladed main rotor, a two-bladed tail rotor and a skid landing gear. It has an enclosed cabin with two rows of side-by-side seating for a pilot and three passengers. Tail rotor direction of rotation on the R44 is reversed compared to the R22 for improved yaw control authority. On the R44 the advancing blade is on the bottom. Development Designed during the 1980s by Frank Robinson and his staff of engineers, the R44 first flew on 31 March 1990. The R44 Astro was awarded an FAA Type Certificate in December 1992, with the first deliveries taking place in January 1993. The first R44 Newscopter featuring onboard electronic news gathering equipment was delivered in 1998. In January 2000, Robinson introduced the Raven with hydraulically assisted controls and adjustable pedals. In July 2002, Robinson introduced the Raven II featuring a more powerful, fuel-injected engine and wider blades, allowing a higher gross weight and improved altitude performance. During November 2015 Robinson announced the Cadet, a Raven I with a cargo area instead of the two back seats, a slightly less powerful engine and a more efficient muffler. Robinson has carried out ground run testing with an aircraft diesel engine that could replace its Lycoming IO-540 avgas engine. The diesel could provide better altitude performance, a fuel burn reduced from per hour and better fuel availability. Operational history In 1997, a Robinson R44 was piloted by Jennifer Murray for the first helicopter circumnavigation of the world by a woman, covering a distance of 36,000 miles in 97 days. , an R44 holds the piston speed record of 227 km/h.

In 2009, the company began installing bladder-type fuel tanks in all new R44 helicopters. It also issued Service Bulletin SB-78 on 20 December 2010, requiring R44 helicopters with all-aluminum fuel tanks to be retrofitted with bladder-type tanks to \\"improve the R44's fuel system's resistance to a post-accident fuel leak.\\" The company recommended that the change should be done as soon as practical, but no later than 31 December 2014. The compliance date was later moved to 30 April 2013. An accident investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in March 2013 found, after analyzing historical data, that a significantly higher proportion of R44 aircraft (12%) caught fire after crashing, compared to accidents involving other types of piston-engine helicopters (7%). Preliminary analysis by the ATSB of the NTSB's accident database found a similar statistic, with 15% of accidents in the US involving R44 helicopters having post-crash fires. Heli Air Robinson R44 Raven II arrives for the 2014 Royal International Air Tattoo, England Although the data did not consider which type of fuel tanks were fitted, the report mentioned four fatal accidents to the R44 fitted with bladder-type tanks, but as far as they knew, did not involve a post-accident fire. The ATSB recommended that the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) take further action to urge R44 owners to fit bladder-type tanks. The FAA, the governing body in the country of manufacture whose directives would normally be followed in other countries like Australia, had not mandated the retrofit; CASA therefore issued Australian-specific airworthiness directive AD/R44/23, grounding R44 aircraft on 30 April 2013 that had not yet been upgraded. Rotor failures On 19 February 2015, the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority issued an Airworthiness Directive grounding 80 of the country's R44 helicopters after two people were killed in an accident traced to a particular type of main rotor blade, the P/N C016-7 or Dash 7, which a preliminary investigation determined had failed in flight. It was the second failure or partial failure in two months. This was the largest-scale grounding of any aircraft in New Zealand's history. The CAA determined through laboratory tests that the rotor blade had failed due to overload during the crash and was not the cause of the accident and the fleet was ungrounded on 24 February 2015. The CAA left the Airworthiness Directive requiring repetitive inspections in place, however. Director of Civil Aviation Graeme Harris stated, \\"we don‚Äôt want to see any complacency amongst operators as there is still a concern with these blades and we are waiting on test results from the USA before we review the Airworthiness notice.\\" Following the grounding in New Zealand, Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also grounded R44 helicopters with the same rotor blades.

The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden, until Garcia's death in 2017 following a stroke. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 Records subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Grandaddy released four studio albums before splitting in 2006, with band members going on to solo careers and other projects. Grandaddy reformed in 2012, made a number of live appearances and released its fifth studio album, Last Place, in March 2017.  History = Formation and early releases  Grandaddy was formed in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was initially influenced by US punk bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who had turned to music after a knee injury forced him to stop skating. Lytle began working at a sewage treatment plant to fund the purchase of music equipment. Several of the band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions. The band members constructed a studio at the Lytle family home, and their first release, also in 1992, was the self-produced cassette Prepare to Bawl. This was followed in April 1994 by a second cassette titled Complex Party Come Along Theories. The singles \\"Could This Be Love\\" and \\"Taster\\" were released later that year. The guitarist Jim Fairchild and the keyboardist Tim Dryden joined the band in 1995. Fairchild, who left another band to join Grandaddy, was another former professional skateboarder and had already guested with them; Dryden had been Fairchild's \\"jam-buddy\\". A third cassette, Don't Sock the Tryer, was withdrawn, and the band instead released their debut mini-album A Pretty Mess by This One Band in April 1996 on the Seattle-based Will label. In 1997 they released their debut full-length album Under the Western Freeway through Will, and, with the help of Howe Gelb, signed a UK deal with Big Cat Records ‚Äì by then a subsidiary of Richard Branson's V2 Records ‚Äì who reissued the album the following year. The album included the single \\"A.M. 180\\", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film 28 Days Later. It was also used for the theme song for the BBC Four television series Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe (9 years later, Screenwipe debuted in 2006), and in an advertisement for Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 show. \\"A.M. 180\\" was also used in television commercials for the Dodge Journey automobile. One of the album's singles, \\"Summer Here Kids\\", was rated as \\"Single of the Week\\" by popular British music magazine NME, and was also used as the theme music for another Charlie Brooker-fronted show, BBC Radio 4's So Wrong It's Right. The album led to an increase in the band's popularity in Europe, and a main stage performance at the Reading Festival in 1998. The album was only a success in the US when later reissued by V2. With the band busy touring in 1999, their next release was the compilation The Broken Down Comforter Collection.  V2 record deal  Unhappy with the efforts of Will Records, the band signed a worldwide deal with V2 Records in 1999, their first release on the label being the Signal to Snow Ratio EP in September that year. In May 2000 they released their second album, The Sophtware Slump, to critical acclaim. NME later placed it at number 34 in their \\"Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade\\", and The Independent described it as \\"easily the equal of OK Computer\\". The album reached number 36 on the UK Albums Chart, and the band's fanbase increased, including celebrities such as David Bowie, Kate Moss and Liv Tyler. By early 2001 the album had sold 80,000 copies worldwide. The first single from the album, \\"The Crystal Lake\\", became the band's first UK top 40 single when it was reissued in 2001. Around the time that The Sophtware Slump was released, Grandaddy was invited to open for Elliott Smith on his tour for Figure 8. On some nights, Smith would join Grandaddy onstage and sing lead vocals on portions of \\"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot\\". The band later opened for Coldplay on their US tour in mid-2001. Also in 2001, the band's version of The Beatles' \\"Revolution\\" was used in the film I Am Sam. Their third album, Sumday, recorded in Lytle's home studio, was released in 2003. The band promoted it with a pre-release US tour with Pete Yorn followed by a three-week European tour (including a performance at the Glastonbury Festival) and a larger US tour. Lytle described the album as \\"Grandaddy influenced by Grandaddy ... the ultimate Grandaddy record\\". In 2004 and 2005 Lytle recorded Just Like the Fambly Cat, which was released as a Grandaddy album, although by then the band had decided to split up. The title is a reference to Lytle's desire to leave Modesto, a town which he complained \\"sucks out people's souls\\". Lytle created the album over a year and a half in his home studio in Modesto, \\"fueled by alcohol, painkillers for his body aches and ... recreational drugs\\", with only Burtch from the remainder of the band playing on it. At the same time as working on the album, Lytle created the EP Excerpts From the Diary of Todd Zilla, which was released first.  Split and post-Grandaddy activities  In January 2006, after a meeting the previous month, Lytle announced that the band had decided to split up, citing the lack of financial income from being in the group. Just Like the Fambly Cat was released later that year as a farewell album. Lytle spoke to the NME: > It was inevitable ... On one hand our stubbornness has paid off, but on the > other hand refusing to buy into the way things are traditionally supposed to > be done has made things worse for us ... The realistic part is it hasn't > proved to be a huge money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band. Lytle had called the meeting in a hotel in Modesto, and it was the first time the band had been in a room together for two years. The feeling at the meeting was described by Lytle as frustration, the result of a breakdown in communication among the band members. According to Lytle the decision was not a surprise: > Everybody knew, but we needed to make it formal, we needed to make it > official. We needed to pay some respects to what we've done, just make it > real. Lytle also stated that he was \\"burnt out on touring\\" and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol problems as a factor in the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was \\"a bit of a loner\\", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: \\"The main thing is not having four girlfriends to lug around with me all the time.\\" Lytle regarded Just Like the Fambly Cat as a \\"pretty fitting\\" last stop for Grandaddy. But he continued to make music and perform solo, and worked with M. Ward on Hold Time. In 2009 Lytle moved from Modesto to Montana, and released his first solo album Yours Truly, the Commuter. In late 2009 Lytle and former Grandaddy drummer Aaron Burtch joined Aaron Espinoza and Ariana Murray of Earlimart to form the band Admiral Radley. Admiral Radley's debut album I Heart California was released on July 13, 2010 via Espinoza's label The Ship. In 2011 Burtch played in a band called The Good Luck Thrift Store Outfit. Lytle's second solo album, Dept. of Disappearance, was released in 2012. Jim Fairchild's first solo album, Ten Readings of a Warning, was released in April 2007 on Dangerbird Records, under the name All Smiles. A second All Smiles album, Oh for the Getting and Not Letting Go, was released on June 30, 2009. In 2010, he was selected to lead a project at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and in 2011 he released his third All Smiles album, Staylow and Mighty. Fairchild has also played for the bands Giant Sand, Great Northern, Lackthereof and Modest Mouse, having first played guitar with the latter in 2005. Reunion (2012-2013) In March 2012, it was announced that Grandaddy had reformed and were to play a limited number of shows, including London on September 4, and headlining the End of the Road Festival in the UK. Grandaddy also played San Francisco's Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival and Paris's Rock en Seine Festival in August 2012. On August 7, 2012, to kick off their reunion tour, they played a \\"secret\\" show at the Partisan venue in Merced, California, but were billed as \\"The Arm of Roger\\". The next day they played as Grandaddy at the Henry Miller Library, Big Sur. Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, \\"The bargain I made myself regarding the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna talk too much about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's the good thing about festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4√ó4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about.\\" Lytle later noted, \\"It was actually Jim [Fairchild]'s fault. He suggested that we consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [but] he convinced me it might be a good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [and] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes. ... I was actually blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together.\\" Lytle also noted that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, \\"It's probably going to happen. ... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [solo] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [it would be] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I like the idea of that. I'd like to give it a shot.\\" In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: \\"I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going to get out there and tour in support of it?' ... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more.\\" Last Place and the death of Kevin Garcia (2014-2018) Grandaddy live at Concorde 2 in Brighton, England, April 1, 2017: Kevin Garcia is at right From 2014 to 2015 Lytle produced the album Why Are You OK by Band of Horses, to which he contributed material; this collaboration also produced the single \\"Hang an Ornament\\", which was issued as the work of Grandaddy and Band of Horses. In September 2015 Lytle tweeted that the band was working on a \\"new GD LP\\", which was interpreted by the media as confirmation that a new Grandaddy album was being recorded. Following a second reunion tour in the summer of 2016, the band announced that a new album called Last Place would be released by Danger Mouse's 30th Century Records on March 3, 2017, and released a video featuring the actor Jason Ritter for the single \\"Way We Won't\\". In March 2017, Lytle said that he could \\"at least promise one more\\" Grandaddy album after Last Place, since it was the first of two that the band was contracted to create. Kevin Garcia (born Kevin Michael Garcia on June 22, 1975 in San Jose, California) died on May 2, 2017, aged 41, one day after suffering a \\"massive stroke\\". He became a member of Grandaddy at the age of 15. Following his death, the band canceled all its planned live appearances. Two commemorative shows were planned in Modesto for October 2017 ‚Äì the first was a scheduled date that had already sold out ‚Äì but these were also canceled due to the band members' ongoing grief over Garcia's passing. Minor activity during the rest of 2017 included the releases of a music video featuring the comedian Jonah Ray for the single \\"Brush with the Wild\\", taken from Last Place, and an EP of live and alternative versions of songs from Last Place titled Things Anyway. To commemorate its 20th anniversary in October 2017, the album Under the Western Freeway was reissued as a double vinyl LP that included eight demo tracks. In November 2018 a song titled \\"Bison on the Plains\\" was released: Lytle revealed that it had been written prior to the completion of Last Place . The Sophtware Slump...on a wooden piano 20th anniversary edition and future (2020-present) On August 28th 2020 it was announced that Grandaddy would release their classic album The Sophtware Slump in a 20th anniversary edition but with a twist, the whole album being performed by Jason Lytle with piano and no other instruments. The album was initially recorded during lockdown by Jason Lytle and is set for release in November 2020. In October 2020, Lytle confirmed that he had plans to record a sixth and final Grandaddy album: \\"I'm working on a solo LP, then I'm gonna' do another Grandaddy record. I'm gonna' go big on the Grandaddy; I want it to be this all-encompassing, cool send-off. I have life plans that don't involve playing live. I want to spend more time outdoors, off the grid.\\" Musical style and influences Much of the band's music is characterized by Lytle's analog synthesizer and the fuzzy guitar, bass and drums of the rest of the band. The band has variously been described as \\"bittersweet indie space rock\\", \\"neo-psychedelic, blissed- out indie rock\\", \\"dreamy, spacey psychedelic pop\\", and \\"an uneasy combination of warm, tactile guitars and affectless electronics\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the band's songs as \\"stately anthems orchestrated with full late-psychedelic pomp: fuzz-toned guitar strumming, rippling keyboards, brawny drumbeats\\". While the band's style has sometimes been described as alt country, in Lytle's view it is the sentiment of country music that the band embraced rather than the musical style. In their early days, the band's lo-fi sound was compared to Pavement. The band has also been compared to Radiohead (even described as \\"the next Radiohead\\" in 2001), Weezer, The Flaming Lips and Elliott Smith. With Sumday, the band was compared to the Electric Light Orchestra and The Alan Parsons Project. Lytle has cited both The Beatles and E.L.O. as influences, stating in 2003: \\"I'm completely in tune with E.L.O. and Jeff Lynne ‚Äì I know that guy like the back of my hand.\\" He stated in 2009: \\"I think the majority of my musical influences were set in stone when I was five or six years old.\\" Lytle's vocals have drawn comparisons with Neil Young.  Lyrical themes  Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\". Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\" There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".  Recording techniques  The band's releases were generally recorded and mixed in makeshift studios based in homes, garages and warehouses, although the last two albums were mixed in a dedicated facility. Although live performances used a full band, much of the recordings were done by Lytle alone using analog recorders and Pro Tools. He recorded basic drum tracks in a soundproofed room and overdubbed cymbals and tom toms. He recorded his vocals close to the strings of a piano for what he described as a \\"ghostly effect\\". Lytle described how the Grandaddy recordings became more of a solo effort, and the right conditions for recording: > Earlier on I tried to include people as much as possible. Then I realised > the magic is me really prying stuff out of my head and getting it on to > tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes > it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm > really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, > the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology > versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best > friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should > be running around getting chased by bumblebees.

It aspired to give television exposure to acts (young and old) unable to acquire airtime on other channels. The managing director of the channel was comedian and folk singer Richard Digance. Chris Tarrant and Mike Osman were executives and associates and Cornish comedian Jethro was a director. The channel was managed by Information TV, a factual channel which broadcasts on the same frequency between midnight and 16:00. Sound TV's launch was delayed several times under its working title of The Great British Television Channel. Opening night 19:00 Mike Osman, Richard Digance and Jethro discussed the vision for the new channel, such as an opportunity to give television exposure and breaks to new talent. Digance commented that they could not financially compete with ITV, and therefore could not afford lavish productions such as Live at Her Majesty's. They contrasted themselves to other television executives: if the turn didn't turn up, they said, then they themselves could do the gig. 19:30 Golden Moments 20:00 The New Variety Show -- From Jethro's club in Devon 22:00 Inside the Comedy Mind -- Alan King meets Robin Williams 23:00 Classice Concert -- Johnny Dickinson Closure Richard Digance resigned from the board of directors in August following creative differences and the station went off air soon after (because of cashflow problems).

He was a member of the Saxon Parliament between 2004 and 2014, serving as the chairman of the NPD parliamentary group and a member of the presidium of the parliament. Apfel became the NPD's national leader in 2011. On 19 December 2013, he resigned with immediate effect from his leadership positions at both the national and the state level, before leaving the party entirely five days later. He resigned from the Saxon Parliament on 17 January 2014. Political activities Apfel has a long history of activism with the NPD, starting in the 1980s when he was active in the NPD's youth organisation. He was the deputy chairman of the NPD at the national level between 2000 and 2009 and deputy chairman at the state level between 2002 and 2009. Between 2009 and 2011, he served as the chairman of Saxony's NPD. State politics On 19 September 2004, Apfel led the NPD in Saxony to its biggest electoral success, winning 9.2% of the popular vote and twelve seats in the Landtag. He became the leader of the party's parliamentary group. In 2005, Apfel and his party refused to take part in a moment of silence for the victims of Nazi Germany, which was to be held in the Saxon Landtag. The NPD parliamentary group had previously demanded that a moment of silence be held for the victims of the bombing of Dresden instead. In the ensuing parliamentary debate Apfel called the Allies of World War II \\"mass murderers\\" and accused the British of having waged a \\"holocaust\\" against Germans. National politics In the 2005 federal election, he was a candidate for the constituency of Kamenz, Hoyerswerda and Gro√üenhain, and received 6.7% of the votes. On 13 November 2011, he was elected leader of the NPD at the national level.Stabwechsel bei der NPD in: Blick nach rechts, accessed 14-11-2011 Resignation On 19 December 2013, he resigned with immediate effect from his leadership positions at both the national and the state level. Media outlets initially reported that Apfel was in poor health and suffering from \\"burnout syndrome\\". Three days after the announcement, the party presidium held an emergency meeting to discuss rumours about Apfel's private life. It subsequently issued a statement asserting that Apfel \\"has not yet refuted ongoing allegations concerning past transgressions\\". Amid the threat of an expulsion proceeding, Apfel resigned from the party entirely on 24 December. Apfel resigned from his seat in the Saxon Parliament on 17 January 2014. Personal life Apfel is married to Jasmin Apfel (born 1983), formerly the head of the NPD women's organisation, Ring Nationaler Frauen. They have three children. In 2012, the couple separated and Jasmin Apfel announced that she had resigned from both the RNF and the NPD. However, Apfel announced later that year that the couple were once again together. It was reported in May 2014 that Apfel and his wife had begun operating a local restaurant on the island of Majorca.

The primosome consists of seven proteins: DnaG primase, DnaB helicase, DnaC helicase assistant, DnaT, PriA, Pri B, and PriC. At each replication fork, the primosome is utilized once on the leading strand of DNA and repeatedly, initiating each Okazaki fragment, on the lagging DNA strand. Initially the complex formed by PriA, PriB, and PriC binds to DNA. Then the DnaB-DnaC helicase complex attaches along with DnaT. This structure is referred to as the pre-primosome. Finally, DnaG will bind to the pre-primosome forming a complete primosome. The primosome attaches 1-10 RNA nucleotides to the single stranded DNA creating a DNA-RNA hybrid. This sequence of RNA is used as a primer to initiate DNA polymerase III. The RNA bases are ultimately replaced with DNA bases by RNase H nuclease (eukaryotes) or DNA polymerase I nuclease (prokaryotes). DNA Ligase then acts to join the two ends together. Assembly of the Escherichia coli primosome requires six proteins, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT, acting at a primosome assembly site (pas) on an SSBcoated single-stranded (8s) DNA. Assembly is initiated by interactions of PriA and PriB with ssDNA and the pas. PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT then act on the PriAPriB- DNA complex to yield the primosome. Primosomes are nucleoproteins assemblies that activate DNA replication forks. Their primary role is to recruit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA. The \\"replication restart\\" primosome, defined in Escherichia coli, is involved in the reactivation of arrested replication forks. Binding of the PriA protein to forked DNA triggers its assembly. PriA is conserved in bacteria, but its primosomal partners are not. In Bacillus subtilis, genetic analysis has revealed three primosomal proteins, DnaB, DnaD, and DnaI, that have no obvious homologues in E. coli. They are involved in primosome function both at arrested replication forks and at the chromosomal origin. Our biochemical analysis of the DnaB and DnaD proteins unravels their role in primosome assembly. They are both multimeric and bind individually to DNA. Furthermore, DnaD stimulates DnaB binding activities. DnaD alone and the DnaD/DnaB pair interact specifically with PriA of B. subtilis on several DNA substrates. This suggests that the nucleoprotein assembly is sequential in the PriA, DnaD, DnaB order. The preferred DNA substrate mimics an arrested DNA replication fork with unreplicated lagging strand, structurally identical to a product of recombinational repair of a stalled replication fork.

The BBC television series The Dave Gorman Collection‚Äî Gorman's first television show‚Äîwas based on the show. The original show was created for the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was nominated for a prestigious Perrier award. An extended version of the show was taken to the West End, then to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival (where it was nominated for a Barry Award), the HBO US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado (where it won the Jury Award for Best One Person Show) and finally to New York where it ran for more than three months and was named Best Comedy Show of 2001 by Time Out New York. Evolution The show originated following a drunken bet between Dave Gorman and his friend Danny Wallace. The bet was thus: Gorman claimed that he shared the name \\"Dave Gorman\\" with the assistant manager of East Fife F.C. and that there must be \\"loads\\" of others around. Wallace disagreed with him. So the two travelled to Methil (from London ‚Äì several hundred miles), with a polaroid camera, to meet the assistant manager, whose name was indeed Dave Gorman. More trips followed, to meet more Dave Gormans. During a trip to New York, Gorman applied somewhat arbitrary criteria to exclude one man from the list on the grounds that a metal plaque outside his offices showed his name as \\"B. David Gorman\\" (his justification for this ‚Äì given on his web forum ‚Äì was \\"You've got to have rules\\"). He did, however, count meeting an actor who had once played a character called Dave Gorman. Initially the bet was fairly vague, but on the way to meet Dave Gormans numbers three and four, they debated what \\"loads\\" meant. Wallace decided on one for every card in the deck including the jokers (54). They tried to keep within a distance of per Dave Gorman, to show that the name was very common. Stage show To aid the search, Gorman created a stage-show about their travels that was also used to appeal for further Dave Gormans to come forward. The show was called Are You Dave Gorman?. This acquired something of a cult following and several people helped Dave in his quest, which he did eventually complete. Five even changed their names by deed poll to Dave Gorman ‚Äì two of them women. Television show All this came to the attention of the BBC, who gave Gorman a series, co-written and co-produced by Wallace. For copyright reasons, the title was changed to The Dave Gorman Collection. The show was effectively the same as the stage show, and took the form of televised lectures, in which he explained what he had done. The six episodes were directed by Pati Marr. Later, after the TV series was broadcast, a book entitled Are You Dave Gorman? was written by Gorman and Wallace. Once the TV show existed Gorman stopped touring the show in the UK, instead taking it to several overseas festivals and later running the show for three months off-Broadway - a run which saw him appearing as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman. Two Australian soap operas have named fictional characters Dave Gorman as an in-joke and the comedian has been bombarded with so many e-mails about it that he has had to publicly appeal to people to stop sending him details of other Dave Gormans. The show was released on DVD on 19 February 2007 under the title Are You Dave Gorman?. It is, however, only available to buy from his website and on Recordstore.

They include a variety of different kinds of people with differing occupations and cultural connotations which depend on the ethnic group they are associated with. They are completely different from the Western notion of what a witch is, as each ethnic group has their own definition and practices attributed to witches. The curses and other magics of witches are often blocked, countered, cured, or lifted by Philippine shamans associated with the indigenous Philippine folk religions. Philippine witches practice a kind of black magic, specifically a malevolent use of sympathetic magic, which is associated with Indigenous Philippine religions. Witchcraft has been present throughout the Philippines before the Spanish colonization. Today it is said to be centered in Pampanga, Talalora, Western Samar and Sorsogon, where many of the country's faith healers reside. Witchcraft also exists in many of the hinterlands, especially in Samar and Leyte, however, witchcraft is known and occurs anywhere in the Philippines. Terminology Each ethnic group in the Philippines has their own terms for witches. Some of these are as follow:Folk Practices and Beliefs in Leyte and Samar, Richard Arens, Divine Word University Publications, 1982Customs of the Tagalogs, Juan de Plasencis, 1589Encyclopedia of Philippine Folk Beliefs and Practices, F. R. Demetrio, Xavier University, 1991 *Tagalog: manggagaway, mangkukulam *Waray: aswang, malupad, malakat, mambabarang *Bisaya: aswang, mambabarang The craft of black magic among Filipino ethnic groups also have unique terms. Some of these are as follow:Encyclopedia of Philippine Folk Beliefs and Practices, F. R. Demetrio, Xavier University, 1991 *Ilocano: tanem, tamay *Tagalog: kulam, gaway *Visayan: barang, hiwit, l√°g√†, haplit, paktol, anyaw *Moro: pantak Black magic Witches are also believed to have powers that cause harm to other people covertly. Healer-sorcerers who practice this kind of sorcery usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that black magic does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually \\"wrongdoers\\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or land grabbers. There are also \\"true\\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like aswang and manananggal. One of the most common kinds of black magic is a malevolent use of sympathetic magic. This is known by various names like kulam, gaway (Tagalog); barang, hiwit, l√°g√† (Visayan); tanem, tamay (Ilocano); and pantak (Moro). Despite the differences in terminology, the methods are almost identical across the Philippine islands (and indeed, across Southeast Asia). This type of sorcery uses beetles, effigies, poppets, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim.The term barang refers to a type of beetle in Visayan. L√°g√† (sometimes written as la-ga or la-aga) means to brew or to boil [in a pot]. (McClenon, 1985) These are usually \\"linked\\" by including bodily exuviae like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically \\"sends\\" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins). In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot \\"linked\\" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the tides. This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by Francisco Comb√©s. Other malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast curses or the evil eye, the ability to \\"abduct\\" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or familiar animals to possess or harm the victim. Some of these purportedly sorcerous powers may be explained by the use of poisons (hilo or lason) and sleight of hand. In most cases however, accusations of this type of black magic are often borne out of paranoia, moral panic, or mass hysteria against disliked or mistrusted members of the community, similar to the European witch-hunts. People accused of black magic were often subject to ostracization and in many cases, violence. This was especially true during the Spanish colonial period, where in one instance in the mid-19th century, a Filipino curate ordered the assassination of 57 people he suspected were sorcerers casting evil spells on his sick mother. Sorcerous \\"attacks\\" are most commonly treated with sumbalik (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, sumbalik can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse. Methods Kulam uses beetles, effigies, poppets, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim. These are usually \\"linked\\" by including bodily exuviae like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically \\"sends\\" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins). Earth (soil), fire, herbs, spices, candles, oils and kitchenwares and utensils are often used for rituals, charms, spells and potions. In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot \\"linked\\" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the tides. This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by Francisco Comb√©s. Barang (the term barang refers to a type of beetle in Visayan) usually employs a swarm of destructive insects, specifically carnivorous beetles. Other methods are usik (sharp magic), hilo and lason (poison magic), paktol (doll magic), laga (boiling magic, L√°g√† sometimes written as la-ga or la-aga, means to brew or to boil [in a pot](McClenon, 1985), and sampal (sea creature magic). Other malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast curses or the evil eye, the ability to \\"abduct\\" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or familiar animals to possess or harm the victim.

Practitioners There are various names for sorcerers in Philippine ethnic groups. Most of these names have negative connotations, and thus is also translated to \\"witch\\" or \\"hag\\" in English sources. These witches actually include a variety of different kinds of people with differing occupations and cultural connotations which depend on the ethnic group they are associated with. They are completely different from the Western notion of what a witch is. They include Bikol: parakaraw; Ilocano: managtanem, managinulod, mannamay; Ivatan: mamkaw, manulib; Kapampangan: mangkukusim (or mangkukusino); Pangasinan: manananem, mangngibawanen; Tagalog: mangkukulam, manggagaway\\"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, , may-galing, hukluban (or hukloban); Visayan: dalagangan, dunganon, dalongdongan, busalian, mambabarang (or mamamarang, mamalarang, barangan), usikan (or osikan), paktolan, sigbinan, manughiwit, mamumuyag, mang-aawog (or mang-aawug, mang-aaug), Hiligaynon: manog hiwit. Other terms are the Spanish brujo and bruja (masculine and feminine forms of \\"witch\\"; Filipinized as bruho and bruha). Mangkukulam A mangkukulam can be considered a Filipino witch, literally meaning \\"a practitioner of kulam\\". A curse is called a sump√¢ (/soom-PA/), which can also be translated as a \\"vow\\" or \\"oath\\" and \\"curse\\". A mangkukulam may use a voodoo doll and a needle to cast spells on people they want to take revenge on, but largely use natural magic and superstitions similar to an arbularyo, or witch doctor. Both can be considered witches, but the main difference is that the arbularyo is more of a doctor who heals people, while a mangkukulam is a malevolent person who tricks and curses others. The primary methods employed by a mangkukulam are candle lighting rituals, scrying or tawas, recitation of spells, and concocting potions. Healer-sorcerers who practice Kulam usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that black magic does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually \\"wrongdoers\\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or land grabbers. There are also \\"true\\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like aswang and manananggal. Modern popular culture also depicts the mangkukulam as using either photographs or the equivalent of a Voodoo doll. Modern popular culture also depicts mangkukulam as mainly doing only love potions and malicious curses, but more extreme depictions claim they can summon ghosts to haunt dolls, raise the dead (or at least control dead bodies), and other things related to necromancy. Mambabarang The Mambabarang is the Bisayan version of a sorcerer/sorceress, who uses insects and spirits to enter the body of any person they hate. Mambabarang are ordinary human beings with black magic who torture and later kill their victims by infesting their bodies with insects. They are different from mangkukulams - the latter only inflict pain or illness. Mambabarang use a strand of hair from their chosen victim and tie it to the bugs or worms which they will use as a medium. When they prick the bug, the victim immediately experiences the intended effect. The name is derived from the word barang. In legends the mambabarang keeps his swarm of carnivorous beetles in a bottle or a section of bamboo, carefully feeding them ginger root. When the practitioner decides to employ his dark art, he performs a prayer ritual wherein he whispers instructions and identifies the victim to the beetles. The destructive insects are then set free and to seek out the victim and gain entry into the body via any bodily orifice: the nose, mouth, ears, anus or dermal breaks such as open sores/wounds. The victim will then feel the effects of the invasion of the insects through manifestations depending on the area of entry; hemorrhoids if through the anus, ear ache if through the ears and other similar cases. The resulting illness is supposedly resistant to conventional medical treatment and only reveals its true nature when the victim succumbs and flying insects issue forth from bodily cavities. In reality, it is possible a carnivorous beetle could lay eggs in someone it killed, and the eggs would then hatch post-mortem.  Remedies  A typical belief of kulam is that curses are mitigated by finding the caster and bribing him or her to lift the curse. Superstitious people still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to kulam. This most often happens in rural areas, where an herbal doctor called an Albularyo, diagnoses a victim using a divination method called Pagtatawas and helps the victim cure his or her malady. Superstitious folks still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to barang. This most often happens in the provinces, where an herbal doctor, albularyo or a faith healer, a mananambal or sorhuana (female) / sorhuano (male) treats such diseases. In some rural provincial areas, people completely rely on the albularyo and mananambal for treatment. In most cases, a healer is also a sorcerer. In order to cure or counteract sorcerous illnesses, healers must themselves know sorcery. This relationship is most apparent in Siquijor Island, where healer-sorcerers are still common. The mananambal specialize in countering barang. As spiritual mediums and divinators, Philippine shamans are notable for countering and preventing the curses and powers of witches, notably through the usage of special items and chants.Myths of the Philippines; Gaverza, J.K., 2014, University of the Philippines Diliman Sorcerous \\"attacks\\" are most commonly treated with sumbalik (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, sumbalik can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing. Darker forms of remedies to kulam include Albularyos whipping the bewitched person with a Buntot Pagi (Stingray's Tail) until the afflicted is forced to divulge the witch's name and confronting him or her. This is done in the belief that the one who is getting hurt is the witch and not the bewitched.

Moros y Cristianos festival in Elda. Parade of a Moor fil√† of the Moros y Cristianos festival in Albacete. Atalaya Castle, Villena. Moros y Cristianos () or Moros i Cristians () literally in English Moors and Christians, is a set of festival activities which are celebrated in many towns and cities of Spain, mainly in the southern Valencian Community. According to popular tradition the festivals commemorate the battles, combats and fights between Moors (i.e. Muslims) and Christians during the period known as Reconquista (from the 8th century through the 15th century). There are also festivals of Moros y Cristianos in Spanish America.Arturo Warman. La danza de moros y cristianos. Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica, Mexico 1972.Milena C√°ceres Valderrama. La fiesta de moros y cristianos en el Per√∫. Fondo Editorial PUCP, 2005. 'Parading' Moorish ships along the beach of Villajoyosa, 2008. The festivals represent the capture of the city by the Muslims and the subsequent Christian reconquering fight. The people who take part in the festival are usually enlisted in local associations called filaes (singular: fil√†) or comparses (companies that represent the Christian or Moor legions). The festivals last for several days, and feature festive parades with bombastic costumes loosely inspired by Medieval fashion. Christians wear fur, metallic helmets, and armor, fire loud arquebuses, and ride horses. In contrast, Moors wear ancient Arab costumes, carry scimitars, and ride real camels or elephants. The festival develops among shots of gunpowder, medieval music, and fireworks, and ends with the Christians winning a simulated battle around a castle. Due to Spanish colonization, the performing art has been adapted in the Philippines since the 17th century and is a popular street play throughout the country. Unlike the Spanish version, the Philippine version is dominated by indigenous Philippine cultures which are used in language, costumes, musics, and dances of the play. The main story of the art, however, has been faithfully retained.http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/pdf_file/domain2/017_Moros_y_Cristianos_Street_Drama.pdf Entrance of the Moors, 2006 - El Campello. Venues The most well-known Moors and Christians festival are the Moors and Christians of Alcoy that takes place in Alcoi (Valencian Community) from 22 to 24 April, around the Feast Day of Saint George (Valencian: Sant Jordi; Spanish: San Jorge), the patron saint of the Crown of Aragon (Catalonia, Aragon and formerly also of the Valencian Community). According to legend, after James I of Aragon reconquered the city of Alcoi, the Moors, in turn, tried to recover it. As fighting was about to resume, Saint George miraculously appeared, and the frightened Moors scattered in defeat. Other traditions ascribe a miraculous saintly appearance to Saint James (Santiago), the patron saint of Spain, particularly at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (in what today is the municipality of La Carolina, Province of Ja√©n, Andalusia), sometimes guiding the Christians to surprise the Moors; else rallying Christian forces during the battle. The feast day of St. James is 25 July, so some of the Moors' and Christians' festivals occur at the end of July. La Vila Joiosa / Villajoyosa celebrates it in the last week of July, with a reenactment of the Berber pirate attack of 1538 (desembarc), according to tradition repelled when St. Martha (feast day 29 July) sent a flash flood.http://www.entertainmentinspain.com/Villajoyosa%20moorsn%20chris%20july.htm Especially in northern and western Spain (Catalonia, Valencian Land, and other places), parades associated with Corpus Christi celebrations may feature gigantic costumed Moors and Christians, also commemorating the Reconquest. Other noteworthy Moors and Christians festivals are celebrated in the towns of Bocairent (a Medieval town, 1‚Äì5 February), Banyeres de Mariola (22-25 April), Villena with approximately 12,000 participants (most crowded festival), Almorad√≠ (early August), Biar, Cocentaina, Crevillent,http://www.entertainmentinspain.com/crevillent_moors_and_christians.htm El Campello, Elche, Elda, Muro d'Alcoi, Oliva, Ontinyent (late August), Orihuela, Petrel, Sax, Novelda, Monforte del Cid, and some districts of the city of Alicante. Andalusia also has very interesting Moors and Christians performances, especially in the former Moorish kingdom of Granada. Performances are mostly organized in rural towns and villages, such as V√°lor, Granada, a small town in the Eastern Alpujarras. Spaniards took this tradition overseas. In the Philippines, fiestas often include a moro-moro play. The show begins with a parade of stars in colorful costumes: Christians wear blue costumes, while Moors wear fully ornamented red costumes.

Philippine Moro y Cristianos In the Philippines, the performing art is officially called Moro y Cristianos Street Drama by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the cultural agency of the government. On July 5, 1637, Jesuit priest F. Hironimo Perez finished the first Moro y Cristianos play in the Philippines. The first drama was played in a church, and was presented to the governor-general for a victory play against Muslims in the south. Afterwards, the play became known in the common tongue as moro-moro, which is the common name of the street drama today. The street drama itself, however, did not draw from actual Christian-Muslim conflict in the Philippines. The main precursor of its popularity in the Philippines was the indigenous awit and corrido traditions in Philippine native cultures. When performing, the representations for the Christians are in blue, while the representations for Muslims are in red or maroon. The street drama includes pasa dobles tune marches, rigodon in battles, courtships between a Moro prince and a Christian princess and vice versa, and a conclusion which usually depicts the Muslim converting into Christianity, the Muslim dying, or the appearance of the Virgin Mary or a saint as the intervention figure of the conflict. The komedya usually begins with a loa, followed by a parada. Usually, the main part of the story begins with a Muslim embahador delivering a challenge to an equally-boastful Christian. The street drama became popular in the rural areas due to the inputting of folk traditions in the play and the need of the people for leisure, especially after a hard day at labor. Overall, the Philippine moros y cristianos may last from one to several days, depending on the Philippine- written script being used. In 2011, the performing art was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/pdf_file/domain2/017_Moros_y_Cristianos_Street_Drama.pdf Music A live marching band plays one of three kinds of music called marchas moras, marchas cristianas and pasodobles. The former two are in the medium or quick time pace. The band, alongside the standard instrumentation, also carries a concert bass drum, timpani and tam-tams.

Initially released in 1974, it focuses on Elmyr de Hory's recounting of his career as a professional art forger; de Hory's story serves as the backdrop for a meandering investigation of the natures of authorship and authenticity, as well as the basis of the value of art. Far from serving as a traditional documentary on Elmyr de Hory, the film also incorporates Welles's companion Oja Kodar, notorious \\"hoax- biographer\\" Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles as himself. F for Fake is sometimes considered an example of a film essay. In addition to the 88-minute film, in 1976 Welles also shot and edited a self-contained 9-minute short film as a \\"trailer\\", almost entirely composed of original material not found in the main film itself.  Plot  The film opens with Welles performing magic tricks for some children while Kodar watches nearby. Welles quotes Robert- Houdin to the effect that a magician is just an actor. Welles promises that for the next hour everything in the film will be based on solid fact. Kodar is then shown strolling around a street in a miniskirt while being ogled by the men on the street. Welles reveals the footage is taken from another experiment about girl-watching, where Kodar deliberately drew attention to herself and the men were unaware they were being filmed. Welles says her story will continue later in the film, and then narrates the story of Elmyr de Hory, an art forger who sold many fake paintings to museums and collectors all over the world. Elmyr is shown throwing a dinner party at his home in Ibiza and being feted by European society, although he dances around the question of whether he is guilty or not. One of those filmed is Clifford Irving, who had published a biography of Elmyr called Fake, and later in a notorious scandal was revealed to have been the forger of a fake \\"authorized biography\\" of Howard Hughes. Welles discusses the irony of Irving commenting on Elmyr's forgery while having committed a version of it himself (Welles states his belief that Irving must have been in the process of working on the hoax at the time he was filmed for the Elmyr project). Irving and Elmyr tell about the art dealers who were fooled by the forgeries, and Welles considers the question whether this means art dealers and appraisers are fake also. Welles presents more of Irving's story of having had secret contact with Hughes, and the odd stories of Hughes's behavior that may or may not have been true. He wonders if believing such stories makes a person credulous or not, and questions the true wisdom of so-called experts, who verified Irving's forgery as authentic. Reichenbach is shown telling how Elmyr provided him with several paintings of questionable authenticity, but the art dealers he gave them to were willfully blind to it. Welles notes that Elmyr doesn't even own the house he lives in; it is provided for him by an art dealer. Welles recounts his own past use of fakery: how he got a job in Ireland by falsely claiming to be a famous New York actor, and how his broadcast of War of the Worlds made deliberate use of fake news to enhance the story. He also notes the coincidence that his first film Citizen Kane was originally going to be a fictionalized version of Howard Hughes.This contradicts published accounts that the film was inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. Irving describes how Elmyr was nearly destitute when younger and subsisted in America by making and selling forgeries that were indistinguishable from the real works, while remaining one step ahead of the law through frequent relocations. He finally moved to Ibiza, but was not prosecuted for lack of witnesses to the actual forging, as well as the scandal that might be aroused by revealing the depth of the art market's complicity in the deception. Elmyr insists he never signed any forgery, and Welles wonders whether, given the fact that all art eventually falls away to ruin, a signature truly matters to any art work. He illustrates the point by shots of the cathedral of Chartres, pointing out that the names of the men who created the magnificent building and the sculptures which adorn it are unknown. They did not sign their work, but it has endured. Welles finally presents Kodar's story: she holidayed in the same village as Picasso, who noticed her and painted 22 pieces with her as the model. She insisted she be allowed to keep the paintings, but later when Picasso read about an acclaimed exhibit of 22 new pieces of his, he flew there in a rage, only to discover the pieces were all forgeries. Kodar took Picasso to her grandfather, the forger, who defended his work with pride while Picasso angrily demanded the paintings back. This dialogue is presented by Welles and Kodar re-enacting the parts of the grandfather and Picasso respectively. Welles then confesses that he had promised everything in the \\"next hour\\" was true, and that hour had already passed. He admits the entire story of Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso was made up. He apologizes, quotes Picasso's statement that art is a lie that makes us see the truth, and bids the audience good evening.

The film grew over time to encompass de Hory, as well as de Hory's biographer Clifford Irving, who was revealed to be a forger himself. Keith Woodward explains: \\"following Irving‚Äôs hoax, Welles and his cinematographer, Gary Graver, shifted gears, scrambling to keep up with the Hughes affair, adding new shots, re-thinking the narrative, re-editing, re-combining different themes, incorporating emerging material.\\" Welles used these circumstances to produce a meditation on the nature of fakery, which he called \\" a new kind of movie ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a form, in other words, the essay, the personal essay, as opposed to the documentary.\\" Several storylines are presented in the film, including those of de Hory, Irving, Welles, Howard Hughes and Kodar. About de Hory, we learn that he was a struggling artist who turned to forgery out of desperation, only to see the greater share of the profits from his deceptions go to doubly unscrupulous art dealers. As partial compensation for that injustice, he is maintained in a villa in Ibiza by one of his dealers. What is only hinted at in Welles's documentary is that de Hory had recently served a two-month sentence in a Spanish prison for homosexuality and consorting with criminals. (De Hory would commit suicide two years after the initial release of Welles' film, on hearing that Spain had agreed to turn him over to the French authorities.) Irving's original part in F for Fake was as de Hory's biographer, but his part grew unexpectedly at some point during production. There has not always been agreement among commentators over just how that production unfolded, but the now-accepted story is that the director Fran√ßois Reichenbach shot a documentary about de Hory and Irving before giving his footage to Welles, who then shot additional footage with Reichenbach as his cinematographer. In the time between the shooting of Reichenbach's documentary and the finishing of Welles', it became known that Irving had perpetrated a hoax of his own, namely a fabricated \\"authorized biography\\" of Howard Hughes (the hoax was later fictionalized in The Hoax). This discovery prompted the shooting of still more footage, which then got woven into F for Fake. Interweaving the narratives even more, there are several pieces of footage in the film showing Welles at a party with De Hory, and, at one point, De Hory even signs a painting with a forgery of Welles' signature. Some of Hughes' career is outlined in the form of a parody of the \\"News on the March\\" sequence in Citizen Kane. Welles also draws parallels between the De Hory and Irving hoaxes and his own brush with early notoriety by including a recreation of part of his 1938 War of the Worlds radio drama, which had simulated a newscast about a Martian invasion and sparked panic among some listeners. The story about Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso and some forger paintings that the grandfather supposedly made is presented at the end of the film before Welles reminds the viewer that he only promised to tell the truth for an hour and that \\"for the last 17 minutes, I've been lying my head off.\\" In the commentary to the Criterion Collection DVD release of F for Fake, Kodar claims the idea for this segment as her own. She also claims credit for the movie's opening sequence, which consists of shots of a miniskirt-clad Kodar walking down streets while rubbernecking male admirers (unaware that they are being filmed) stop and openly stare. This sequence is described by Kodar as inspired by her feminism; in his narration, Welles claims the footage was originally shot for an unrelated production.

When it finally came out, Welles produced a preview \\"trailer\\" for it, which was effectively a wholly original 9-minute film, shot and edited in a similar style to the film itself. Apart from some very brief split-second camera shots, the entire film is a self-contained short containing original material starring Welles, Gary Graver and Oja Kodar. The trailer has subsequently been restored in colour, and is included as an extra on some DVD versions of the film.Gary Graver and Andrew J. Rausch, Making Movies With Orson Welles: A Memoir (Scarecrow Press, New York, 2008) p.170  Reception  F for Fake faced widespread popular rejection. Critical reaction ranged from praise to confusion and hostility, with many finding the work to be self-indulgent and/or incoherent. F for Fake has grown somewhat in stature over the years. The film embraces ideas from the self-conscious notation of the film process to the ironic employment of 1950s-era B movie footage (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers). Welles thought he was creating a new form of cinema. When writer Jonathan Rosenbaum asked Welles if he was creating a documentary, he replied, ‚ÄúNo, not a documentary ‚Äî a new kind of film.\\" On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.79/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"F for Fake playfully poses intriguing questions while proving that even Orson Welles' minor works contain their share of masterful moments.\\"  Style  According to some reviews, the F for Fake mash-up has possibly paved the way for the modern \\"attention-deficit\\" style of editing. More likely, Welles was influenced by those that came before, such as the French New Wave director Jean Luc Godard and Dadaist filmmakers like Ren√© Clair who used editing to alternately build and deconstruct. What is unique to the film is the concept of the unreliable narrator ‚Äî a key subject of the film itself, which at many points shows Welles sitting at an editing controller, as he narrates and draws self-reflexive attention to the problems with veracity in life and filmmaking. Several filmmakers contributed to the forgery that is F for Fake including B-movie cinematographer Gary Graver (who contributes all footage filmed in the U.S., as well as some very choppy editing, and his own voice/image as the dubious on-screen \\"newscaster\\") as well as Welles' girlfriend and muse, Oja Kodar (who is ogled both by Welles' camera and by stock footage of males who \\"see\\" her). It is unclear where Welles' participation stops and his lesser- known collaborators begins, as the film employs multiple editors, multiple directors, multiple cross cuttings of unrelated footage and the often erratic use of creative geography as well as multiple voice-overs. An example of this appears with a series of near wordless shots of Irving and de Hory seemingly in debate as to whether de Hory ever signed his forgeries (the shots of Irving and de Hory were in fact taken at different times). Welles's autobiographical asides in the film reflect on his 1938 radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, which caused a nationwide panic with its fake news broadcast. In introducing this chapter of his life, Welles declares his uncertainty as to his own authenticity, as he believes he too has engaged in fraud. While the basic facts of The War of the Worlds incident are correctly given, the apparent excerpts from the play featured in the movie are complete fabrications, including a scene in which President Roosevelt meets the Martian invaders‚Äîsomething which did not happen in the original (fabricated) broadcast.  Questions of truthfulness  Author Robert Anton Wilson, a great fan of the film, argued in Cosmic Trigger III: My Life After Death that the film was itself largely an intentional effort at fakery by Welles in support of the film's themes. Most directly, Wilson reports that in the BBC documentary Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film, Welles stated that \\"everything in that film was a trick.\\" Secondly, many of the interviews in the film were with people who were themselves directly involved with forgery in one way or another, often making statements that would have been known by the filmmakers to be false, but which were allowed to pass without comment in the film. Similarly, Welles himself made numerous false statements about Oja Kodar in the film. Finally, Wilson points out several scenes which, while presented in a way that implies they were filmed in real time, were upon further inspection clearly fabricated from unrelated pieces of footage in a way guaranteed to mislead the casual viewer.

In his youth he was a member of The Ancients, a group of followers of William Blake. Later in life he established a career as a portrait painter, which included painting the portraits of the British gentry, nobility and royalty. He was the son of Thomas Richmond, miniature- painter, and was the father of the painter William Blake Richmond as well as the grandfather of the naval historian, Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond. A keen follower of cricket, Richmond was noted in one obituary as having been \\"an habitu√© of Lord's since 1816\\"James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual for 1897, p. 288. Life=Early life George was born at Brompton, then a country village, on 28 March 1809. His mother, Ann Richmond, came of an Essex family named Oram, and was a woman of great beauty and force of character. His brother Thomas Richmond was also a portrait artist. One of his earliest recollections was the sight of the lifeguards marching to the cavalry barracks at Brompton on their return from the campaign of Waterloo, and he remembered when a lad walking for a mile beside the Duke of York, in order to sketch him for his father, from whom he received his first instruction in art. He went for a short time only to a day school kept by an old dame in Soho, and at fifteen became a student at the Royal Academy. Here he was much impressed by the personality of Henry Fuseli, then professor of painting, formed a friendship, which lasted a lifetime, with Samuel Palmer, and had as fellow- students and companions Edward Calvert, Thomas Sidney Cooper, esq., R.A., and Frederick Tatham, whose sister he married. Among other early friends was John Giles, Palmer's cousin, and a man of devout life and deep religion, who deeply influenced the literary taste, general culture, and religious views of his friends. Blake and the Ancients Christ and the Woman of Samaria (1825), one of Richmond's early works, influenced by the art of William Blake. When Richmond was sixteen he met William Blake, of whom Palmer and Calvert were devoted admirers, at the house of John Linnell at Highgate. The same night Richmond walked home across the fields to Fountain Court with the poet and painter, who left on Richmond's mind a profound impression, ‚Äòas though he had been walking with the prophet Isaiah.‚Äô From this time till Blake's death, Richmond followed his guidance and inspiration in art. Traces of Blake's influence are seen in all Richmond's early works, and especially in ‚ÄòAbel the Shepherd,‚Äô and in ‚ÄòChrist and the Woman of Samaria,‚Äô exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825. In 1827 he was present at Blake's death, and had the sad privilege of closing the poet's eyes and taking his death mask; he, his wife Julia, and a little band of young enthusiasts, of whom he was the last survivor, followed Blake to his grave in Bunhill Fields. George Richmond An Old Calabrian Shepherd, oil on canvas, 1838, 24 x 20 ins (Private Collection, UK) Along with Palmer, Calvert, Tatham and others he formed the Blake- influenced group known as \\"The Ancients\\". This influence faded in later life, when he produced relatively conventional portraits. Later life In 1828 Richmond went to Paris to study art and anatomy, the expenses of the journey being met from money earned by painting miniatures in England before leaving and in France during his stay. He spent a winter in the schools and hospitals, and saw something of the social life of the Paris of Charles X; at Calais he exchanged pinches of snuff with the exiled Beau Brummell. On his return to England he spent some time at the White Lodge, Richmond Park, with Lord Sidmouth, who gave him much valuable counsel, and whose portrait by him in watercolour is now in the National Portrait Gallery. In 1830 his contributions to the academy comprised two poetical subjects, ‚ÄòThe Eve of Separation‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Witch,‚Äô from Ben Jonson's ‚ÄòSad Shepherdess,‚Äô and three portraits. In 1831 he exhibited but one picture, ‚ÄòThe Pilgrim.‚Äô Watercolour of William Wilberforce, 1833.He had now formed a deep attachment to Julia, a beautiful daughter of Charles Heathcote Tatham, the architect, and when her father revoked the consent he had at first given to their union, the young couple ran away, journeyed to Scotland by coach in the deep snow of a severe winter, and were married according to Scottish law at Gretna Green in January 1831. This act proved the turning-point of Richmond's career, and determined him to adopt portraiture as the readiest means of earning a living. Soon after the young couple had set up house in Northumberland Street, they were found and befriended by Sir Robert Harry Inglis, and it was at his instance that the portrait in watercolour of William Wilberforce, afterwards engraved by Samuel Cousins, was painted by Richmond; this picture, by its happy treatment of a difficult subject, and by the excellence of the engraving after it, achieved a worldwide success. There followed immediately many successful watercolour portraits, among which may be mentioned those of Lord Teignmouth, the Frys, the Gurneys, the Buxtons, the Upchers, and the Thorntons, all traceable to Inglis's friendly introduction. In 1837 Richmond was forced to take a rest for the sake of his health, which had broken down through overwork and the loss of three children within a very short time. He went to Rome with his wife and their surviving child Thomas, accompanied by Samuel Palmer and his bride, a daughter of John Linnell. During his stay in Italy, which lasted about two years, he made studies and copies of many of the subjects on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, having a scaffolding erected so as to reach the vault; here he made the acquaintance of Cardinal Mezzofanti, of whose colloquial English he always spoke with wonder. Subsequently, he visited Naples, Pompeii, and the cities of Tuscany with Baring, for whom he painted a picture of 'The Journey to Emmaus.' While still in Rome he painted a picture of ‚ÄòComus,‚Äô afterwards exhibited. In southern Italy, Richmond painted three portraits in oil on canvas that would help establish his reputation as the pre-eminent portrait painter of his generation: 'An Old Calabrian Shepherd' (Feb. 1838), 'A Neapolitan' (Mar. 1837) and 'Vine Dresser' (Apr. 1838). In Rome Richmond made many valuable friends, including Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, Henry Acland, the Severns, Thomas Baring, Lord Farrer, and John Sterling, and his house on the Tarpeian rock was a meeting-place for these young English travellers. John Sterling, in letters to Richard Chenevix Trench, writes of Richmond as the most interesting young artist he had met. In after years he was one of the original members of the Sterling Club. He returned to England in 1839, and resumed his practice as a portrait-painter, revisiting Rome, however, with his brother Thomas in 1840. Then, as related in ‚ÄòPr√¶terita,‚Äô Richmond made the friendship of Ruskin, who later introduced him to Thomas Carlyle. About the same period Richmond travelled in Germany with John Hullah, alighting on Munich where he studied for a while under Peter von Cornelius. Richmond was a member of ‚ÄòThe Club‚Äô (Johnson's), Nobody's Friends, Grillion's Club, to which he was limner, and the Athenaeum Club, London. A staunch churchman, he was intimate for years with all the leaders of the tractarian movement. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, an honorary fellow of University College, London, and of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and a member of the Company of Painter-Stainers of the City of London. In 1846 he was nominated by Gladstone to succeed Sir Augustus Wall Callcott on the council of the government schools of design, a post which he held for three years; and ten years later he was appointed a member of the royal commission to determine the site of the National Gallery, when he was alone in voting for its removal from Trafalgar Square to South Kensington. In 1871, and again in 1874, Gladstone pressed upon him to accept the directorship of the National Gallery, but the prime minister was unsuccessful. In 1870 he bought Porch House, a 15th-century timber-framed house in the Wiltshire village of Potterne, near Devizes, and took advice from Ewan Christian on its restoration. The work included the addition of glass mosaic floors and encaustic floor tiles. George Richmond died at his house, 20 York Street, Portman Square, where he had lived and worked for fifty-four years, on 19 March 1896, retaining almost to the end a clear and vigorous memory. He was buried at Highgate cemetery, and is commemorated by a tablet designed by his sons to be placed in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, close to the graves of Wren and of Leighton. He left ten children and forty grandchildren. His surviving sons included Canon Richmond of Carlisle and Sir William Blake Richmond, K.C.B., R.A. Of his daughters, three married respectively F. W. Farrer, Archdeacon Buchanan, canon of Salisbury, and Justice Kennedy. Works Charlotte Bront√´ by George Richmond, 1850 Richmond's portraits of eminent persons in England were steadily produced for forty years, initially in crayon and watercolour. After 1846 he began to paint in oil, and left a large number of excellent portraits in this medium. Many of his portraits were reproduced as engravings. The Victorian Exhibition held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1891‚Äì2 contained eight of his portraits in oil, forty in crayon, and two (Mrs. Fry and Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, both dated 1845) in watercolour. The oil pictures included Earl Granville, Archbishop Longley (1863), Bishops Selwyn and Wilberforce, Canon Liddon, and Sir George Gilbert Scott, R.A. (1877). Among the crayon portraits were Cardinal Newman (1844), John Keble, Henry Hallam (1843), Charlotte Bront√´ (1850), Elizabeth Gaskell (1851), Lord Macaulay (1844 and 1850), Sir Charles Lyell (1853), Michael Faraday (1852), and Lord Lyndhurst (1847). He also drew or painted Queen Adelaide, Prince George (at that time Duke) of Cambridge, and the Prince of Wales, (later Edward VII) when a boy; Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, the Duke of Newcastle, and Gladstone; Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Tait, and Dean Stanley; Sir Thomas Watson, Syme, Alison, and Sir James Paget; Prescott, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Darwin, Owen, Harriet Martineau and Tyndall, and a host of others. Richmond was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1857, a royal academician in 1866, and some years before his death he joined the ranks of the retired academicians. He took a warm interest in the winter exhibitions of the old masters at the Royal Academy. On the death of his wife in 1881 he gave up regular work, but still painted occasionally and occupied himself with sculpture. He had previously, in 1862, designed and executed a recumbent statue in marble of Charles James Blomfield, bishop of London, for St. Paul's Cathedral, and in 1882 he executed the marble bust of Dr. Pusey, now in Pusey House, Oxford, and presented a bust of John Keble to Keble College. Among his later works in oil were portraits of Harvey Goodwin, bishop of Carlisle, Edward King, bishop of Lincoln, and Archibald Campbell Tait, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's jubilee, he painted a portrait of the third Marquis of Salisbury (the last work he executed), which was presented to the queen by the marquis's wife. His success as a portrait-painter was due as much to his power of drawing out the best from his sitter in conversation as to skill in delineation. Being a very skilful and rapid draughtsman, he was able, while putting himself into sympathy with his sitter, to report the happiest moment and fleeting changes of expression, and to get out of his subject more than at first sight appeared to be there. His ideal of portraiture was ‚Äòthe truth lovingly told;‚Äô and he never consciously flattered. He was also a most industrious and clever sketcher from nature, and he produced (for his own pleasure and instruction) hundreds of drawings in pencil and watercolour, many of great beauty, of figure and landscape. To his skill as a portrait-painter were added great knowledge of Italian painting and sound judgment in matters of art, and the government were often glad to avail themselves of his services and advice. In the National Portrait Gallery are portraits by him of Lord Sidmouth (watercolour); Lord-chancellors Cranworth and Hatherley, Baron Cleasby and Lord Cardwell (oil paintings); Samuel Rogers, the poet, and John Keble (crayon drawings), both bequeathed by the painter; besides drawings, purchased in July 1896, of Earl Canning, Viscount Hill, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Canon Liddon, Archbishop Longley, Sir Charles Lyell, Cardinal Newman, Dr. Pusey, Sir Gilbert Scott, Sir Robert Harry Inglis, and Bishop Wilberforce.

Her keel was laid down on 26 January 1971 at Krasnoye Sormovo in Gorky. She was launched on 22 April 1972, and was commissioned on 31 October 1972 into the Soviet Pacific Fleet. Sinking incidents In early 1983, K-429 returned to base needing overhaul after a long patrol. After turning their boat over to the shipyard, crew departed on leave. Her nuclear weapons remained aboard. Ordered to sea That June, Captain First Rank Nikolay Suvorov was ordered by Rear Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev, commander of the Pacific Fleet, to reassume command of K-429 and to take part in an exercise. Suvorov questioned the order: the exercises had been planned for later in the year, the boat was being repaired, the crew was on leave, and Suvorov expected a transfer to Saint Petersburg. Yerofeyev explained that Suvorov's Communist Party membership would be revoked and he would have to face a tribunal if he asked such questions. Without Communist Party membership, Suvorov would not be allowed to command a warship. Suvorov recalled his crew and returned to K-429. Much of the crew could not be contacted, and their places were filled by sailors from the naval base and from five other boats that were in port at the time. Nearly one-third of the 120 crewmen had never been on K-429 before, and none of them received any training on K-429. On 23 June 1983, K-429 was ordered to proceed immediately to the torpedo firing range. Suvorov refused that order, replying that standard operating procedures required him to perform a test dive first. The sinking In the late evening on 23 June, K-429 arrived at her testing area in Sarannaya Bay, just south of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and Suvorov gave the order to dive to periscope depth. However, he had not given the preliminary command to set the diving watch ‚Äî the crew neither aligned the boat's systems for sea, nor were they at their stations to control the boat during the dive. Because the boat had not been prepared to dive, instrumentation valves were not aligned properly, and even though the main ballast tanks were filling, their indicators read empty. Confused, Suvorov ordered auxiliary ballast tanks filled. Over-ballasted to about 60 tons negative buoyancy, the boat dove very quickly. While K-429 was in the shipyard, her ventilation system had been opened to the maximum extent possible, so as to exhaust fumes from welding. Various interlocks that would automatically shut ventilation valves were disabled. This lineup was not corrected before the boat dove. The open ventilation system caused immediate catastrophic flooding of the forward compartments. Suvorov ordered an emergency ballast blow, but the operator became confused and shut the flood valves on the bottoms of the tanks, while opening the vents on the tops of the tanks. About half of the boat's supply of high-pressure air was wasted through the vents without displacing any water. The forward compartments took on about 420 cubic meters (420 tons) of water before the ventilation system could be secured, killing 14 men immediately. At about midnight, the boat hit bottom, about 39 meters down. Although Suvorov had made mistakes that contributed to the sinking, his insistence on a test dive had saved the remaining men: the torpedo firing range was around 200 meters deep. If Suvorov had proceeded there directly, K-429 would have been lost. The rescue The boat's emergency buoys and escape capsules had been welded to the hull to prevent losing them at sea, so escape would require the crew to make a free ascent in Arctic waters. Suvorov assumed that his report that he would make a test dive had been received, and that the duty officer would give the alarm in about an hour when he failed to report re-surfacing. He ordered his crew to remain at their stations and await rescue, even though the boat's battery had begun releasing hydrogen. Several hours later, during the morning of 25 June, Suvorov called for volunteers. Two of his original crew donned escape gear, locked out of the torpedo room escape trunk, and successfully ascended to the surface. They saw no ships in the area, so they swam to shore, where they were arrested by military police. Their report reached Admiral Yerofeyev at about noon. By 19:15 that evening, the boat had been located, and the first sailor ascended to the waiting rescue ships at 22:36. During the rescue, two more seamen were lost during their ascent. The last seaman reached the surface at 23:00. Aftermath On 6 August K-429 was raised and towed into shallow water, and salvage began. It transpired that the reactor had shut down automatically, but that its control rods had jammed before reaching their full stroke and the reactor had been operating at about 0.5% power since the disaster. No radiation or contamination leakage was found. On 8 August, K-429 was raised into dry dock. Suvorov was sentenced to ten years in prison. Likhovozov, chief of the fifth compartment, was sentenced for eight years. They were arrested in the barracks where the court took place, without letting them say good-bye to their wives. Suvorov told an interviewer, \\"I am not fully innocent. But a fair analysis should have been made to avoid such accidents in the future. I told the judges in my concluding statement: if you do not tell the truth, others do not learn from bad experiences ‚Äî more accidents will happen, more people will die.\\" Admiral Yerofeyev was promoted to Commander-in- Chief of the Northern Fleet. On 13 September 1985, K-429 sank at her moorings. She was again raised and decommissioned.

The Los Angeles Times called him \\"a handsome hot-eyed newcomer who makes the case for this product of the city's slums ‚Äî 'live fast, die young and have a good looking corpse' ‚Äî all too fascinating for everybody's comfort.\\" The film was made for Bogart's Santana company and released through Columbia Pictures, who signed Derek to a seven-year contract in April 1948. Derek followed that picture with a supporting role as the son of Broderick Crawford in All the King's Men (1949), the Best Picture Oscar winner for its year, starring Broderick Crawford. In September 1950, the actor had his name formally changed to John Derek. Columbia promoted him to lead roles, as Robin Hood in Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950) with Alan Hale; the Los Angeles Times called him a \\"slim and beautiful youth\\". He was meant to follow it with The Gainesville Circus, but the film was never made. Instead, Columbia put him in another swashbuckler, Mask of the Avenger (1951), then they gave him a good dramatic role in a prestige film, Saturday's Hero (1951), as a college football player. The novel had been bought specifically as a vehicle for Derek. He was in a crime noir, The Family Secret (1951), then reunited with Crawford in Scandal Sheet (1952). Derek was borrowed by Republic Pictures for a war film, Thunderbirds (1952). He went back to Columbia for Prince of Pirates (1953), a swashbuckler for Sam Katzman; two Westerns, Ambush at Tomahawk Gap (1953), with John Hodiak and The Last Posse (1953) with Crawford. He was back with Hodiak for Mission Over Korea (1953), a Korean War film, then was again borrowed by Republic for Sea of Lost Ships (1953). In July 1953, Derek left Columbia. Freelance actor Derek made another film for Republic, The Outcast (1954), a Western. Walter Wanger used him for The Adventures of Hajji Baba (1954) released by 20th Century Fox, a surprise hit. He had a showy role as John Wilkes Booth in Prince of Players (1955) at Fox then was in a drama An Annapolis Story (1955) at Allied Artists. Paramount In March 1954 Derek signed a long-term contract with Paramount. His first films for the studio were Run for Cover (1955), a Western with James Cagney and Nicholas Ray and The Leather Saint (1956), a boxing film. He also appeared as Joshua in The Ten Commandments (1956). He wanted to make a film about Joaquin Murrieta but it was never made. Derek travelled to Italy to appear in Pirate of the Half Moon (1957). He made a Western Fury at Showdown (1957) and a movie in Britain The Flesh Is Weak (1957). He supported Cornel Wilde in Omar Khayyam (1957), and starred in High Hell (1958). In Europe he was in Prisoner of the Volga (1959) and he played an Arab in Exodus (1960). He was in a TV series Frontier Circus. Director Derek disliked acting. He later said he \\"was never into it. If they'd given me the greatest role in the world it wouldn't have helped. I used to go to the directors of my films and say: 'I'm not an actor but I'll turn up on time and know my words.' In the 13 films I made I only ever did one take per scene. Directors never went for a second because they knew it'd be no different from the first. I never liked acting. Or my films. Maybe one, a cheap little Western called The Outcast. I liked that because I love horses. One of the troubles was I had a monotone voice which went even flatter when I tried to act. When I saw my first film Knock On Any Door in Italy I only liked it because my voice was dubbed by an Italian actor who had a lot of fire in his voice.\\" Derek appeared alongside his second wife Ursula Andress in Nightmare in the Sun (1965), which Derek co-produced. He turned to directing with a war film, Once Before I Die (1966), also with Andress. Derek eventually quit acting. \\"In this town people think you must be nuts to do something like that,\\" he said. \\"They can't believe you just didn't enjoy it.\\" He directed A Boy... a Girl (1969) with Dean Paul Martin, and Childish Things (1969) with his third wife, Linda Evans. In 1973 he directed Bo Derek in Fantasies, which wasn't released until 1981. He made Love You (1979), a hardcore pornographic film which Bo produced. The film 10 (1979) made his wife Bo a star with the result that Derek was able to raise the finance for Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981), which received mostly negative reviews. In his review for the film, Roger Ebert called it \\"completely ridiculous,\\" but added that it had a \\"certain disarming charm.\\" The couple intended to follow it with Eve and That Damned Apple but when Universal delayed financing they decided to make Bolero (1984) for Cannon, which was an unhappy experience for the Dereks. His last film as director was Ghosts Can't Do It (1990). An accomplished photographer, Derek photographed the last three of his four wives (at different times) for nude spreads in Playboy magazine. Derek directed the music videos for Shania Twain's \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\" and \\"Any Man of Mine\\". Personal life Derek and his first wife Pati Derek married Turkish-born prima ballerina Pati Behrs Eristoff in 1948.. They had a son, Russell Andre (1950‚Äì1999), who was paralyzed from the chest down due to a 1969 motorcycle accident, and a daughter, Sean Catherine (born 1953), who later wrote a memoir titled Cast of Characters, published in 1982, about their dysfunctional relationship. Derek walked out on his wife and family in late summer 1955 after meeting 19-year-old aspiring Swiss actress Ursula Andress, who spoke almost no English when they met. He and Behrs were divorced in 1956. In 1957, Derek married Andress in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony. Five years later, her small role in the James Bond film Dr. No launched her career. Derek threw Andress out of his California home in 1964 over rumors that she had been seeing actor Ron Ely. Andress then went back to Europe, engaging in public affairs with co-stars John Richardson and Marcello Mastroianni before officially leaving Derek for Jean-Paul Belmondo in 1965. The pair divorced in 1966. In September 1965, Derek became involved with American actress Linda Evans, at the time starring in television's The Big Valley. A couple of years into their relationship, Evans reduced her appearances on the show to spend more time with him, and financed his alimony and child support payments to Behrs, as he had quit acting by then to pursue photography and directing. They eloped in Mexico in 1968, with Sean as a witness. John and Bo Derek with Chandran Rutnam In 1973 Derek, Evans and 16-year-old high school dropout Mary Cathleen Collins traveled to the Greek island of Mykonos to make the film And Once Upon a Time (unreleased until 1981, under the title Fantasies). During filming, Derek and Collins began an affair. Evans returned to the United States and filed for divorce in 1974, but Derek and Collins stayed in Europe until she turned 18 in November of that year, in order that he would avoid statutory rape charges. Collins became known to the public as Bo Derek following their marriage on June 10, 1976, and achieved international fame in 1979 with her role in the Blake Edwards film 10. The couple remained together until John died in 1998. Derek suffered a heart attack in 1986, but completely recovered. Derek had one granddaughter, Alyce Derek (born 1969) from Russell's marriage to Lynette Berry. He became a great-grandfather in 1996. In 2019, Derek's great-granddaughter Asia Duran was arrested on drug charges in Santa Maria.https://www.ksby.com/news/2019/03/23/search-warrant-leads-to-4-arrests- in-santa-maria Death John Derek died on May 22, 1998, from cardiovascular disease in Santa Maria, California, at the age of 71.Donnelley 2005, p. 177.

He was the subject of the best-selling book Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom, a former student of Schwartz. He was portrayed by Jack Lemmon in the 1999 television film adaptation of the book. Personal life Schwartz was the son of Charlie Schwartz, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who migrated from Russia to escape the army. Schwartz's mother died when he was eight years old, and his brother David developed polio at a young age. His father would eventually marry a Romanian woman named Eva Schneiderman. Later in Schwartz's life, his father suffered from a heart attack after fleeing a mugging. Schwartz came from a Jewish family, but as an adult he adopted multiple beliefs from a variety of different religions. Schwartz had two sons with his wife Charlotte, Rob and Jon. Tuesdays with Morrie Schwartz achieved national prominence posthumously after being featured as the subject of Mitch Albom's 1997 best- selling memoir, Tuesdays with Morrie. Albom had been a student of Schwartz's at Brandeis University, and years later had seen Schwartz on the television program Nightline. After Albom phoned Schwartz, he made a series of trips to visit him in the final weeks of Schwartz's life as he was gradually overtaken by ALS. The book recounts the fourteen visits Albom made, their conversations, Schwartz's lectures, and his life experiences.

It features in Greek mythology. It is a tributary to the river Alfeios, which empties into the Ionian Sea. It is long.Greece in Figures January - March 2018, p. 12 Course The Ladon rises on the western slope of the Aroania mountain, near the village Kastri√°, Kleitoria municipal unit, Achaea. It flows south, receives its left tributary Aroanios, flows along Kleitoria and turns southwest near the Arcadian border. It flows through the artificial Ladon Lake, and turns south again near Dimitra. It flows into the Alfeios 3 km southeast of the village Tripotamia. It joins the Tragus near Zevgolatio. Mythology The river was among those mentioned by Hesiod in Theogony; they were \\"all sons of Oceanus and queenly Tethys\\" for, according to the image of world hydrography common to the ancients, the fresh water that welled up in springs came from the underworld caverns and pools and was connected with the salt sea. Rain fertilized crops, but the sense that its runoff filled the rivers did not figure in the Greek mythic picture. Rivers were personified and credited with wooing nymphs and human maidens and fathering children. One daughter, the nymph Metope was wed to the river Asopus. Rivers have cleansing effect in Greek mythology. When Poseidon assaulted Demeter, she washed away the insult in the waters of the River Ladon.

It was Newman's first album to obtain major commercial success, peaking at number 36 on the Billboard 200. The premiere live performance of the album took place on October 5, 1974, at the Symphony Hall in Atlanta, Georgia, with guest Ry Cooder and Newman conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Genesis Good Old Boys was initially envisioned as a concept album about a character named Johnny Cutler, an everyman of the Deep South. Newman made a demo of these songs on February 1, 1973: they were released as the bonus disc for the 2002 reissue, titled Johnny Cutler's Birthday. The kernel of this concept survived into the released album, although as Newman's take on viewpoints from the inhabitants of the Deep South in general, rather than from a single individual character. As on his previous release, Newman addressed generally taboo topics such as slavery and racism, most stringently on the opening song \\"Rednecks\\", a simultaneous satire on institutional racism in the Deep South and the hypocrisy of the northern states in response. Newman also incorporates actual historical events into the album, remarking upon the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 on \\"Louisiana 1927\\" and a plea to Richard Nixon to alleviate poverty as a result of the recession of the mid-1970s on \\"Mr. President (Have Pity on the Working Man)\\". Preceding an original song (\\"Kingfish\\") recounting achievements and slogans of Louisiana politician Huey \\"The Kingfish\\" Long, Newman performs with members of the Eagles on a song written by Long himself, \\"Every Man a King\\". As with all of Newman's early albums, some material Newman wrote had been previously recorded by other artists. In this case, \\"Guilty\\" had been initially recorded and released by Bonnie Raitt on her 1973 album Takin' My Time. A lengthy analysis of Good Old Boys, including a detailed description of the Dick Cavett Show broadcast that inspired \\"Rednecks\\", is included in Steven Hart's essay \\"He May Be a Fool But He's Our Fool: Lester Maddox, Randy Newman, and the American Culture Wars\\", included in the collection Let the Devil Speak: Articles, Essays, and Incitements. In 2014, Turntable Publishing released the ebook Song of the South: Randy Newman's Good Old Boys, by David Kastin, a full-length critical study of the album's sources, evolution, and reception. In the Sixth Edition of his classic Mystery Train, Greil Marcus cited Kastin's book as an \\"effectively- illustrated...excavation of the entire severed corpus of the work and a deep dive into the history‚Äîmusical, social economic, sectional, and water- born‚ÄîNewman both drew from and recast.\\" Singles On the same day as the album, the track \\"Guilty\\" was released as Reprise single 1324, with \\"Naked Man\\" on the B-side, and on January 29, 1975, the track \\"Louisiana 1927\\" was released as Reprise single 1387, with \\"Marie\\" on the flip. Neither single appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. Reception Robert Christgau gave the album an A rating upon release, and in retrospective reviews both the 1992 edition of the Rolling Stone Album Guide and AllMusic gave it a five-star rating. In 2012, the album was ranked number 394 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2000 it was voted number 902 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. It spent two weeks in the top 40 of the Billboard 200 in late 1974, with an overall 21-week tenure. It also earned a gold record in the Netherlands. On May 21, 2002, an expanded edition of the album was issued by Rhino Records on compact disc, including a bonus track demo of \\"Marie\\" and a second disc containing the February, 1973 demos entitled Johnny Cutler's Birthday. Included in these demo recordings are Newman's verbal descriptions of sound effects and other characters, the songs as a whole describing a narrative in the vein of integrated musicals dating from the 1940s. \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" is an early version of \\"Back on My Feet Again\\". The song \\"Marie\\" was used in the family film Paulie in 1998. All tracks were written and arranged by Randy Newman; strings arranged by Nick DeCaro on \\"Marie\\" and \\"Rollin'\\"; Moog and ARP synthesizers programmed by Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff.

During his sophomore year of high school, he decided to enter the priesthood and was sent to St. Mary's Preparatory in Orchard Lake Village, Michigan. He graduated from St. Mary's Preparatory in 1948, and then entered St. Mary's College, also in Orchard Lake Village. In 1950, he transferred to Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1952. He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from St. Mary's University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956. Ordination and ministry On May 26, 1956, Maida was ordained a priest by Bishop John Dearden at the Cathedral of St. Paul in Pittsburgh. His first assignment was as assistant pastor of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Church in Pleasant Hills. He later served at Holy Innocents Church in Sheraden.

Maida is no longer eligible to vote in any future conclaves as he reached his 80th birthday on March 18, 2010. Maida is the ecclesiastic advisor to the Catholic Advisory Board for the Ave Maria Mutual Funds and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic University of America. In 2002, St. Gertrude School, part of the Diocese of Greensburg in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, was renamed Cardinal Maida Academy in Maida's honor. The school, which offers instruction from grades kindergarten through six, is near his hometown of East Vandergrift, Pennsylvania. Retirement On March 18, 2005, Maida followed church law and submitted his retirement request to the Vatican (age 75). The Vatican asked Maida to remain archbishop until further notice. On June 8, 2006 Maida celebrated the 50th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. On January 5, 2009, the Holy See announced acceptance of Maida's resignation and the appointment of Allen Henry Vigneron, then Bishop of Oakland, as his successor as Archbishop of Detroit.

The leaves are deciduous, rounded, 6‚Äì15 cm long and 5‚Äì13 cm across, softly hairy on both surfaces, and with a coarsely double-serrate to shallowly lobed margin. The main limbs are quite small in diameter in relationship to the straight trunk, and arise at almost a 90-degree angle. Making the tree quite durable to urban conditions and helps maintain a symmetrical crown which landscape architects love so much. The flowers bloom in early spring before the leaves, and are dioecious, with single-sex catkins; the male pale yellow and 5‚Äì10 cm long, the female very small and largely concealed in the buds, with only the bright red 1‚Äì3 mm long styles visible. The flowers on female trees are not very visible. On male trees, however, the flowers are visible. The fruit is a nut sometimes called \\"Turkish nuts\\" about 1‚Äì2 cm long, surrounded by a thick, softly spiny and bristly involucre (husk) 3 cm diameter, which encloses all but the tip of the nut; the nuts are borne in tight clusters of 3-8 together, with the involucres fused at the base. The fruit matures in September and is edible, with a taste that is very similar to common hazels. They are occasionally gathered from the wild as well as from urban trees, but their small size (smaller than common hazel nuts) and very hard, thick nut shell (3 mm thick) makes them of little or no commercial value. Corylus colurna is however important in commercial hazelnut orchards, as it does not sucker, making it the ideal rootstock on which to graft the nut-bearing common hazel cultivars. The nut can only be found on female trees. Nut production is irregular and occurs every two to three years Turkish Hazel. (n.d.) The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. (1970-1979). Retrieved February 26, 2014 from http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Turkish+Hazel Root Corylus colurna have fibrous roots. The roots of Corylus colurna are not adventitious, meaning they do not form suckers. This makes Corylus colurna desirable for grafting on the rootstock over a single stemmed trees. This allows Corylus colurna to be grown in poorer and rocky soils.Nikolva, M. (2007). Experimental results on variety-rootstock interaction in filbert culture. Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca, 35(2), 82-87. Cultivation Corylus colurna has a medium growth rate. It is occasionally drought tolerant and alkaline soil tolerant. However, it prefers moist, well-drained soil, as well as full sun. Once established Corylus colurna is tolerant of heat, cold, and drought. There are no serious pests or problems with Corylus colurna. Corylus colurna is not easily transplantable and will need extra watering in summer after transplanting. It will take about two years after transplant for the tree to become established and survive on its own.Phillips, L. (2002, July). Turkish Hazelnut. (Tree of the Month). Arbor Age, 22(7), 38.

Propagation The most common form of propagation for Corylus colurna is by seed. It is best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame. The seed will germinate in late winter or spring. If starting with a stored seed, the seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 to 4 months cold stratification. This will allow the seed to germinate in 1 to 6 months if kept at 20 ¬∞C. Once the seed is large enough to handle, pick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. You can plant the seed into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.L. (2013). Corylus colurna turkish hazel pfaf plant database. Retrieved from http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Corylus colurna  Identification Features There are a couple distinct features to identify Corylus colurna. Leaves are alternate, simple, broadly ovate to obovate, doubly serrate, glabrous above, and pubescent veins below. Corylus colurnas buds are 1/3 inch long, green tinted brown. and softly pubescent. Young trees have gray stems. Uses Besides its use as a single-stem rootstock for Corylus avellana, Corylus colurna is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree in Europe and North America. It is very tolerant of difficult growing conditions in urban situations, which in recent decades has increased its popularity in civic planting schemes. Turkish hazel makes a good shade tree since it produces very dense shade, and its narrow crown and ability to withstand air-pollution make it well suited for use as a street tree in urban areas. It makes a rather formal statement in the landscape due to the tight, consistently-shaped, narrow crown. It is well suited for areas which have restricted overhead. Corylus colurna is also used in different sized parking lot islands and a variety of wide lawns. It is recommended for a buffer strip around parking lots or highways. Also it is used as a street tree, specimen tree, or in sidewalk cut outs. Other landscape uses for Corylus colurna are for fruit, difficult and dry sites, naturalistic areas, and street trees.

The \\"Nuremberg Files\\" The Nuremberg Files is a website that displays the names and locations of various doctors who perform abortions throughout the United States. They came under fire as controversial because they provided photos, addresses, and other personal data of abortion providers. They also updated the listings of those doctors who had been killed or injured by anti-abortion activists, suggesting approval for such anti-abortion violence. The name is a reference to the Nuremberg Trials, where Nazi German leaderhip were sentenced to death for their involvement in the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes. While the original site was shut down in 2002, it has reappeared more than once on other ISPs. Horsley has been forced to change his Internet service provider numerous times due to the site's content, and his website has been hacked on several occasions. It has been stated that information from the Nuremberg Files site was used by James Charles Kopp to track down and kill Buffalo doctor Barnett Slepian in 1998. Kopp fled the country (becoming a fugitive in Canada) but allegedly maintained contact with Horsley while on the run. Kopp was later arrested in France and extradited to New York, where he is serving a life sentence. After Slepian's murder, Planned Parenthood's president Gloria Feldt denounced Horsley's website at a press conference. The publicity generated hundreds of thousands of hits (Horsley claims 400,000). Horsley was named as a co-conspirator in a successful civil suit, Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists,\\"Abortion Foes' Internet Site on Trial\\" , Washington Post, January 15, 1999 filed by Planned Parenthood over the information compiled by him and \\"Unwanted Posters\\" of doctors, which was judged by the court to constitute a threat of violence, even without an explicit call to violence. The U.S. Supreme court has twice refused to hear the case, upholding the ruling, but asking that the punitive damages be reconsidered. Punitive damages were reduced from $108 million to $4.7 million. The ruling also provides for $11 million in treble damages and $526,000 in compensatory damages. As part of the judgment, Horsley was to take down the \\"Nuremberg Files\\" section of his website. The verdict was later overturned on appeal, and the files returned. The case was reheard en banc, and the court determined that the files constituted \\"true threats\\" that are not constitutionally protected. Karin Spaink ran a mirror of the site in the Netherlands for about a week after the district court decision. She later decided to take down the mirror website. Waagner incident In 2001, self-described militant Clayton Waagner, an armed bank robber who had escaped from an Illinois prison, showed up at Horsley's home brandishing a gun. Horsley alleges that Waagner told him that he was stalking and planned to kill 42 abortion clinic workers who were profiled on the website, and presented evidence that he was the author of hundreds of phony anthrax letters that had been sent to abortion clinics and elected officials. Going to the media after his meeting with Waagner brought more attention to Horsley and his website. Waagner was arrested in December 2001, and is now serving a lengthy prison sentence.\\"Fugitive abortion foe: I sent anthrax threats\\" , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 25, 2001. Lawsuits During an appearance on Upfront Tonight on CNBC, Geraldo Rivera accused Horsley of \\"aiding and abetting a homicide\\" in the Slepian murder. Horsley sued Rivera for libel and slander, but the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found against Horsley, concluding that Rivera was merely \\"expressing his belief that Horsley shared in the moral culpability for Dr. Slepian's death\\".Clarkson, Frederick. \\"A radical antiabortionist backs down\\" , Salon Magazine. June 21, 2002. URL accessed on 2006-03-29 Horsley also unsuccessfully sued Glorida Feldt of Planned Parenthood and Kim Gandy of the National Organization for Women for similar statements.Horsley v. Feldt, Run for Governor In 2010, Horsley ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia, under his Creator's Rights Party, on a nullification platform.  Elton John  Horsley was arrested in 2010 for making terrorist threats, after posting a YouTube video stating: \\"We‚Äôre here today to remind Elton John that he has to die\\".https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/georgia-man- arrested-for-threatening-elton-johns-life-64941/ The charges were subsequently dropped. Bestiality During an interview in 2005 Horsley told Alan Colmes that he (Horsley) had engaged in bestiality when he was an adolescent, including having sex with a mule. Death Horsley died on April 13, 2015 in Carrollton, Georgia.

She was named for Point Defiance, a location in Pierce County, Washington, the site of a military reservation established by the U.S. Government in 1866. She was the second ship assigned that name. The construction of the first ship, Point Defiance (LSD-23), was canceled on 17 August 1945. Point Defiance (LSD‚Äì31) was laid down on 23 November 1953 by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss.; launched on 28 September 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Arthur D. Struble; and commissioned on 31 March 1955, Commander Oscar B. Parker in command. Service history=1955-1962 Following shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, the new dock landing ship arrived Long Beach, California, in July 1955 and joined Amphibious Squadron 7, Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet. After two deployments to the western Pacific, Point Defiance became one of the first rocket- launching surface ships to support the 1958 International Geophysical Year Solar Eclipse Expedition to the South Pacific. Launchers on deck fired eight Nike-Asp sounding rockets to collect scientific data during the eclipse. In May 1959 Point Defiance participated in the large scale and highly successful amphibious \\"Operation Twin Peaks\\" off Oceanside, California In February 1960 Point Defiance made her third cruise to the western Pacific, participating in \\"Operation Blue Star\\", a combined amphibious operation with Chinese Nationalist Forces. In June 1960 she participated in \\"Operation Sea Hawk\\", a combined amphibious landing with Republic of Korea forces and returned to Long Beach in July. She operated off the West Coast during most of 1961, and made a brief cruise to Pearl Harbor and Okinawa. Point Defiance departed Long Beach for the western Pacific in January 1962. In May she landed Marines at Bangkok, Thailand. In October she transited the Panama Canal and steamed to the Caribbean ready to act if needed during the Cuban Quarantine. 1963-2011 In early 1963 Point Defiance carried bathyscaphe Trieste from San Diego through the Panama Canal to Boston for deep search operations into the cause of the loss of the nuclear submarine . In September Point Defiance was on her way to the western Pacific again. In October she steamed to Vietnam to safeguard U.S. interests, and in November participated in another combined amphibious operation with the Republic of China. From April to September 1964, Point Defiance operated in the eastern Pacific, then underwent overhaul. She departed for the western Pacific on 27 April 1965 and off-loaded men and equipment at Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 26 May. On 18 June she helped rescue survivors from the midair collision of two Guam-based B-52s. In July she landed Marines at Qui Nh∆°n, South Vietnam, and in early August helped salvage , aground on Pratas Reef. In late August she took part in Operation Starlite, an amphibious raid at Van Tuong, South Vietnam, which inflicted heavy enemy casualties. After another successful amphibious landing, she returned home on 24 November. Point Defiance again departed for the western Pacific on 27 March 1966, and began transporting troops and equipment from U.S. bases in the Far East to South Vietnam. She returned to Long Beach on 24 June, but deployed to South Vietnam again on 1 November. On 11 January 1967 Point Defiance participated in \\"Deckhouse V\\", a major U.S. operation in the Kien Hoa area. On 18 May she sent U.S. Marines on to the beach in the southern half of the Demilitarized Zone, exchanging fire with North Vietnamese shore batteries. She returned to Long Beach on 24 June. On 7 May 1968 Point Defiance was off on another deployment to the western Pacific, once again with an amphibious ready group off Vietnam. She returned to Long Beach on 18 December. In the summer of 1969, \\"Point Defiance\\" carried a contingent of Naval Academy Midshipmen from San Diego to Seattle to Honolulu and back to San Diego. In 1972 the Point Defiance was again part of a Ready Group off the coast of Vietnam. It was part of a helicopter assault behind People's Army of Vietnam lines off the coast of northern South Vietnam in the area of Hu·∫ø during the Easter Offensive of 1972. : [1968-2011] Decommissioning, 1983-2011 Point Defiance was decommissioned on 30 September 1983 and her name struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 February 1992. She was sold to Pegasus Inc., on 29 September 1995, but repossessed by the Navy, 1 July 1997. Custody was transferred to Maritime Administration (MARAD), 18 December 1998, and she was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. On 28 July 2011, Point Defiance was sold by MARAD to All Star Metals of Brownsville, Tx for $578,539 to be dismantled.https://voa.marad.dot.gov/Solicitation_Awards/docs/mar-610/MA-14147-POINT- DEFIANCE-SIGNED.pdf Point Defiance departed the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 8 September to be cleaned by Allied Defense Recycling at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard.http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=1389516 Point Defiance was towed to Brownsville upon completion of the cleaning and is currently undergoing scrapping.

Sigil, from the Latin sigillum, meaning a \\"little sign\\", means a sign or image supposedly having magical power. In 1999 Philip Gwyn adopted the term \\"to mean the funny character at the front of a Perl variable.\\"  Historical context  The use of sigils was popularized by the BASIC programming language. The best known example of a sigil in BASIC is the dollar sign (\\"\`$\`\\") appended to the names of all strings. Many BASIC dialects use other sigils (like \\"\`%\`\\") to denote integers and floating point numbers and their precision, and sometimes other types as well. Larry Wall adopted shell scripting's use of sigils for his Perl programming language. In Perl, the sigils do not specify fine-grained data-types like strings and integers, but the more general categories of scalars (using a prefixed \\"\`$\`\\"), arrays (using \\"\`@\`\\"), hashes (using \\"\`%\`\\"), and subroutines (using \\"\`&\`\\"). Raku also uses secondary sigils, or twigils,\\"Perl 6 variables:Twigils\\", Perl 6 Documentation to indicate the scope of variables. Prominent examples of twigils in Raku include \\"\`^\`\\", used with self-declared formal parameters (\\"placeholder variables\\"), and \\"\`.\`\\", used with object attribute accessors (i.e., instance variables). In CLIPS, scalar variables are prefixed with a \\"\`?\`\\" sigil while multifield (e.g., a 1-level list) variables are prefixed with \\"\`$?\`\\". In Common Lisp, special variables (with dynamic scope) are typically surrounded with \`*\` in what is dubbed the \\"earmuff convention\\". While this is only convention, and not enforced, the language itself adopts the practice (e.g., *standard-output*). Similarly, some programmers surround constants with \`+\`. In CycL, variables are prefixed with a \\"\`?\`\\" sigil. Similarly, constant names are prefixed with \\"\`#$\`\\" (pronounced \\"hash-dollar\\"). In Elixir, string sigils are provided via the \\"\`~\`\\" symbol. In MAPPER (aka BIS), named variables are prefixed with \\"<\\" and suffixed with \\">\\" because strings or character values do not require quotes. In mIRC script, identifiers have a \\"\`$\`\\" sigil, while all variables have a \\"\`%\`\\" prefixed (regardless of local or global variables or data type). Binary variables are prefixed by an \\"\`&\`\\". In the MUMPS programming language, \\"\`$\`\\" precedes intrinsic function names and 'special variable names' (built-in variables for accessing the execution state). \\"\`$Z\`\\" precedes non-standard intrinsic function names. \\"\`$$\`\\" precedes extrinsic function names. Routines (used for procedures, subroutines, functions) and global variables (database storage) are prefixed by a caret (^). The last global variable subtree may be referenced indirectly by a caret and the last subscript; this is referred to as a \\"naked reference\\". System-wide routines and global variables (stored in certain shared database(s)) are prefixed with ^%; these are referred to as \\"percent routines\\" and \\"percent globals\\". In Objective-C, string literals preceded with \\"\`@\`\\" are instances of the object type \`NSString\` or, since clang v3.1 / LLVM v4.0, \`NSNumber\`, \`NSArray\` or \`NSDictionary\`. The prefix-\`@\` is also used on the keywords \`interface\`, \`implementation\`, and \`end\` to express the structure of class definitions. Within class declarations and definitions as well, a prefix of \`-\` is used to indicate member methods and variables, while prefix \`+\` indicates class elements. In the PHP language, which was largely inspired by Perl, \\"\`$\`\\" precedes any variable name. Names not prefixed by this are considered constants, functions or class names (or interface or trait names, which share the same namespace as classes). PILOT uses \\"\`$\`\\" for buffers (string variables), \\"\`#\`\\" for integer variables, and \\"\`*\`\\" for program labels. Python uses a \\"\`@\`\\" prefix to denote a decorator. In Ruby, ordinary variables lack sigils, but \\"\`$\`\\" is prefixed to global variables, \\"\`@\`\\" is prefixed to instance variables, and \\"\`@@\`\\" is prefixed to class variables. Ruby also uses (strictly conventional) suffix sigils: \\"\`?\`\\" indicates a predicate method returning (usually) a boolean value; and \\"\`!\`\\" indicates that the method may have a potentially unexpected effect, and needs to be handled with care. In Scheme, by convention, the names of procedures that always return a boolean value usually end in \\"\`?\`\\". Likewise, the names of procedures that store values into parts of previously allocated Scheme objects (such as pairs, vectors, or strings) usually end in \\"\`!\`\\". Standard ML uses the prefix sigil \\"\`'\`\\" on a variable that refers to a type. If the sigil is doubled, it refers to a type for which equality is defined. The \\"\`'\`\\" character may also appear within or at the end of a variable, in which case it has no special meaning. In Transact-SQL, \\"\`@\`\\" precedes a local variable or parameter name. System variables (known as global variables) are distinguished by a \\"\`@@\`\\" prefix. In Windows PowerShell, which was partly inspired by Unix shells and Perl, variable names are prefixed by the \\"\`$\`\\" sigil. In XSLT, variables and parameters have a leading \\"\`$\`\\" sigil on use, although when defined in \`<xsl:param>\` or \`<xsl:variable>\` with the \\"\`name\`\\" attribute, the sigil is not included. Related to XSLT, XQuery uses the \\"\`$\`\\" sigil form both in definition and in use. In MEL, variable names are prefixed by \\"\`$\`\\" to distinguish them from functions, commands, and other identifiers. Similar phenomena=Shell scripting variables In Unix shell scripting and in utilities such as Makefiles, the \\"\`$\`\\" is a unary operator that translates the name of a variable into its contents. While this may seem similar to a sigil, it is properly a unary operator for lexical indirection, similar to the \`*\` dereference operator for pointers in C, as noticeable from the fact that the dollar sign is omitted when assigning to a variable. Identifier conventions In Fortran, sigils are not used, but all variables starting with the letters I, J, K, L, M and N are integers by default. Fortran documentation refers to this as \\"implicit typing\\", though explicit typing is always available to allow any variable to be declared with any type. (The choice of range I‚ÄìN conforms to traditional mathematical naming conventions.) Various programming languages including Prolog, Haskell, Ruby and Go treat identifiers beginning with a capital letter differently from identifiers beginning with a small letter, a practice related to the use of sigils. Stropping Actually a form of stropping, the use of many languages in Microsoft's .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) requires a way to use variables in a different language that may be keywords in a calling language. This is sometimes done by prefixes. In C#, any variable names may be prefixed with \\"\`@\`\\". This is mainly used to allow the use of variable names that would otherwise conflict with keywords. The same is achieved in VB.Net by enclosing the name in square brackets, as in \`[end]\`. The \\"\`@\`\\" prefix can also be applied to string literals; see literal affixes below.  Hungarian notation  Related to sigils is Hungarian notation, a naming convention for variables that specifies variable type by attaching certain alphabetic prefixes to the variable name. Unlike sigils, however, Hungarian notation provides no information to the compiler; as such, explicit types must be redundantly specified for the variables (unless using a language with type inference). As most standard compilers do not enforce use of the prefixes, this permits omission and also makes code prone to confusion due to accidental erroneous use.Linux kernel coding style, by Linus Torvalds Literal affixes While sigils are applied to names (identifiers), similar prefixes and suffixes can be applied to literals, notably integer literals and string literals, specifying either how the literal should be evaluated, or what data type it is. For example, \`0x10ULL\` evaluates to the value 16 as an unsigned long long integer in C++: the \`0x\` prefix indicates hexadecimal, while the suffix \`ULL\` indicates unsigned long long. Similarly, prefixes are often used to indicate a raw string, such as \`r\\"C:\\\\Windows\\"\` in Python, which represents the string with value \`C:\\\\Windows\`; as an escaped string this would be written as \`\\"C:Windows\\"\`. As this affects the semantics (value) of a literal, rather than the syntax or semantics of an identifier (name), this is neither stropping (identifier syntax) nor a sigil (identifier semantics), but it is syntactically similar. Java annotations Compare Java annotations such as @Override and @Deprecated. Confusion In some cases the same syntax can be used for distinct purposes, which can cause confusion. For example, in C#, the \\"\`@\`\\" prefix can be used either for stropping (to allow reserved words to be used as identifiers), or as a prefix to a literal (to indicate a raw string); in this case neither use is a sigil, as it affects the syntax of identifiers or the semantics of literals, not the semantics of identifiers.

(\\"Diastrophism\\" is a general word referring to a twisting.) Diastrophic dysplasia is due to mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. Affected individuals have short stature with very short arms and legs and joint problems that restrict mobility. Signs and symptoms This condition is also characterized by an unusual clubfoot with twisting of the metatarsals, inward- and upward-turning foot, tarsus varus and inversion adducted appearances. Furthermore, they classically present with scoliosis (progressive curvature of the spine) and unusually positioned thumbs (hitchhiker thumbs). About half of infants with diastrophic dysplasia are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. Swelling of the external ears is also common in newborns and can lead to thickened, deformed ears. The signs and symptoms of diastrophic dysplasia are similar to those of another skeletal disorder called atelosteogenesis, type 2; however diastrophic dysplasia tends to be less severe. Genetic  Diastrophic dysplasia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. It is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. The protein encoded by this gene is essential for the normal development of cartilage and for its conversion to bone. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, but in adulthood this tissue continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene alter the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly and resulting in the skeletal problems characteristic of diastrophic dysplasia. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that the defective gene is located on an autosome, and both parents must carry one copy of the defective gene in order to have a child born with the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are usually not affected by the disorder. Prevalence Diastrophic dysplasia affects about one in 100,000 births.

Career Although she is often pigeonholed as a \\"Chinese-Canadian woman film director,\\" Shum prefers to be known as an \\"independent filmmaker\\", rather than one of national identity. She views this label as one way to get audiences to view her film without prejudice.Melnyk 2010, p. 203 When discussing her association with feminism and multiculturalism Shum says, \\"Because I'm a living breathing human being in Vancouver, which is a very multicultural city, and I'm a woman, I tend to get tagged as someone who might write about \\"issues.\\" But that's not where it starts for me, it starts on a very human level. I use narrative to reveal things that people don't see.\\"Davar 2008 Shum describes herself as being an enthusiastic consumer of ideas, movies, art, theatre, music, dance, fiction, and non-fiction. When discussing her inspirations she says, \\"I read interviews with people I've never heard of. And I listen to both friends and strangers speak. I live entirely, throw myself into situations, get my heart broken, soar with infatuations. And somehow all that gets funneled through my guiding intention, which is to reflect and reveal how we can be happier. How to live more authentically, how to make the most out of this one life.\\" Short films Shum's first short film, Picture Perfect, is a 1989 release about a man obsessed with pornography and the effects of media on his personal life. The film is based on Shum's ex- boyfriend being a pornography addict and her experiences finding out about it. She ended up casting him in the lead role.Chang 2007, pp. 85‚Äì86 Picture Perfect was nominated for \\"Best Short Drama\\" at the 1989 Yorkton Film Festival.Mockler 2012 In 1993, Shum released a 20-minute documentary about her family titled, Me, Mom and Mona. The film is reminiscent of a television talk show surrounding the lives of three women. Through the duration of the film, the women discuss the complexities of familial history and the sometimes strained relationship with the patriarch of the family. The film was well- received and won \\"Best Short Film\\" at the Toronto International Film Festival.Lee, Angela. \\"Mina Shum Launches Career As A Filmmaker\\" Chinatown News, 1994 Shum has written and directed several other short films, including: Shortchanged, Love In, Hunger, and Thirsty. Her most recent short film titled, Hip Hop Mom, was released online in 2011 and has garnered thousands of hits. Feature films Shum has directed four feature-length films. Her first feature-length film, Double Happiness, was released in 1994, and stars Sandra Oh. Double Happiness, is a semi-autobiographical film based on Shum's early experiences of leaving home as a teenager. The film is about an aspiring actress trying to assert her independence from the expectations of her Chinese Canadian family. Double Happiness won numerous awards including: the \\"Wolfgang Staudte Award\\" at the Berlin International Film Festival, the \\"Audience Award\\" at the Torino International Festival of Young Cinema, and \\"Best Canadian Feature Film\\" at the Toronto International Film Festival. Shum's second feature film, Drive, She Said, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1997 and was in official competition at the Turin Delle Donne Film Festival. Drive, She Said, is about a woman that is willingly taken hostage by a bank robber and accompanies him cross country to visit his ailing mother and her estranged family. Her third feature film, Long Life, Happiness & Prosperity was screened as part of the Canadian Perspective Program at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival and at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. The film is about a young girl who uses Taoist magic to help her mother's financial situation and love life.Caddell, Ian. \\"Mina Shum and the Pursuit of Happiness (Part 3).\\" '‚ÄôReel West Magazine'‚Äô, 2002, pp. 26‚Äì28 In her three narrative feature films, Double Happiness, Drive, She Said, and Long Life, Happiness, and Prosperity, Shum uses a comedic approach to depict the Chinese Canadian family in multicultural Canada. She says that as a Chinese immigrant, she uses humour to characterize society in general.Chang 2007, p. 85 Shum's films often features ironic, discontented young women that want to leave home for something better. In her films, Shum characterizes home as being a place of conflict, boredom, and disappointment. Her depiction of familial negotiations ensure conflicts for her protagonists. In February 2014, Shum began shooting in Montreal on a National Film Board of Canada feature documentary entitled Ninth Floor, about the Sir George Williams Affair student protest. Filming coincided with the 45th anniversary of the incident. Ninth Floor premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. It deals with an incident in 1969 at Sir George Williams University (later merged into Concordia University) where students occupied a ninth-floor computer lab to protest the handling by school officials of a complaint about racial discrimination. At the 2015 Vancouver International Film Festival, Shum was awarded the Women in Film+Television Artistic Merit Award for Ninth Floor.

It is rare, and infants with the disorder are usually stillborn; however, those who survive birth die soon after Symptoms and signs Infants born with this condition have very short arms and legs, a narrow chest, and a prominent, rounded abdomen. This disorder is also characterized by an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), distinctive facial features, an inward- and downward-turning foot (clubfoot), and unusually positioned thumbs (hitchhiker thumbs). The signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis, type 2, are similar to those of another skeletal disorder called diastrophic dysplasia. Atelosteogenesis, type 2 tends to be more severe, however. Genetics Atelosteogenesis, type 2 is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. The protein made by this gene is essential for the normal development of cartilage and for its conversion to bone. Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene disrupt the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly and resulting in the skeletal problems characteristic of atelosteogenesis, type 2. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene‚Äîone from each parent‚Äîmust be inherited for a child to be born with the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected by disorder, but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.

The procedure is used to screen for colon cancer and polyps, and may detect diverticulosis. A virtual colonoscopy can provide 3D reconstructed endoluminal views of the bowel. VC provides a secondary benefit of revealing diseases or abnormalities outside the colon. Procedure This video shows a virtual colonoscopy of the rectosigmoid colon performed in a retrograde fashion. There is a 10-mm colonoscopically-proven polyp in the sigmoid colon seen at the top of the frame at the midpoint of the movie. The movie concludes at the tip of the rectal tube which was used to insufflate the colon. While preparations for VC vary, the patient will usually be asked to take laxatives or other oral agents at home the day before the procedure to clear stool from the colon. A suppository is also used to cleanse the rectum of any remaining fecal matter. The patient may also be given a solution designed to coat any residual faeces which may not have been cleared by the laxative, called 'faecal tagging'. This allows the physician (usually a consultant radiologist), viewing the 3D images to effectively subtract the left-over faeces, which may otherwise give false positive results. VC takes place in the radiology department of a hospital or medical center. The examination takes about 10 minutes and does not require sedatives. During the procedure: * The patient is placed in a supine position on the examination table * The patient may be given a dosage of Butylscopolamine intravenously to minimize muscle activity in the area. * A thin tube is inserted into the rectum, so that air can be pumped through the tube in order to inflate the colon for better viewing. * The table moves through the scanner to produce a series of two-dimensional cross-sections along the length of the colon. A computer program puts these images together to create a three-dimensional picture that can be viewed on the video screen. * The patient is asked to hold his/her breath during the scan to avoid distortion on the images. * The scan is then repeated with the patient lying in a prone position. After the examination, the images produced by the scanner must be processed into a 3D image, +/- a fly through (a cine program which allows the user move through the bowel as if performing a normal colonoscopy). A radiologist evaluates the results to identify any abnormalities. The patient may resume normal activity after the procedure, but if abnormalities are found and the patient needs conventional colonoscopy, it may be performed the same day.\\"Virtual Colonoscopy\\" - National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse - NIH Advantages VC may be more comfortable for some individuals, as it does not require the use of a colonoscope. As a result, no sedation is needed, and the patient can return to his/her usual activities or go home after the procedure without the aid of another person. The lack of sedation also lowers the risk of the procedure since some people may have adverse reactions to sedative medications used during conventional colonoscopy. VC provides clearer, more detailed images than a conventional x-ray using a barium enema, sometimes called a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series. Further, about 1 in 10 patients will not have a complete right colon (cecum) evaluation completed with conventional colonoscopy. It also takes less time than either a conventional colonoscopy or a lower GI series.Virtual Colonoscopy - Mayo Clinic. \\"Virtual colonoscopy is typically faster than traditional colonoscopy. A scan of your colon takes about 10 minutes. Expect the entire virtual colonoscopy procedure to take 20 to 30 minutes.\\" VC provides a secondary benefit of revealing diseases or abnormalities outside the colon. One study of asymptomatic adults undergoing routine VC found that approximately one unsuspected extracolonic cancer was detected per 300 screenings in addition to about one invasive colorectal cancer per 500 screenings, for an overall rate of approximately one unsuspected cancer of any type detected per 200 screenings. Invasive colorectal cancer was the most common malignancy detected, followed by renal cell carcinoma. Disadvantages During virtual colonoscopy it is not possible to take tissue samples (biopsy) or remove polyps, so a conventional colonoscopy must be performed if abnormalities are found. Also, VC does not show as much detail as a conventional colonoscopy, so polyps smaller than between 2 and 10 millimeters in diameter may not show up on the images.Findings presented at the American College of Gastroenterology annual scientific meeting in Las Vegas, Nev. An abstract of the study was printed in the September 2006 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Furthermore virtual colonoscopy performed with CT exposes the patient to ionizing radiation, on the order of a milligray. Some research has demonstrated that ultra-low dose VC can be just as effective in demonstrating bowel disease due to the great difference in x-ray absorption between air and the tissue comprising the inner wall of the colon. Optical colonoscopy is taken as the \\"gold standard\\" for colorectal cancer screening by the vast majority of the medical and research communities. However, some radiologists recommend VC as a preferred approach to colorectal screening. Virtual colonoscopy is favored by some professionals because it permits complete visualization of the entire colon, hence providing more opportunity to identify precancerous polyps and cancer, and to then do prompt diagnostic biopsies or therapeutic removal of these lesions. Alternatives MRI colonography (MRC) allows similar visualizing without radiation exposure. It can detect larger adenomas and neoplasia with high specificity, but less sensitivity than conventional colonoscopy. NotesReferences * Adapted from public domain Virtual Colonoscopy.

St. Mary's was built in 1843-44 at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C., was commissioned in the fall of 1844, Commander John L. Saunders in command. Service history=Gulf of Mexico, 1844-1846 Designated initially for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron, St. Mary's was at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania awaiting the sailing of her squadron, under Commodore Robert Stockton, when tension over Mexican-Texan-American territorial disputes heightened during the winter of 1845. On 1 March, President John Tyler signed a joint resolution of Congress recommending the annexation of Texas. By the end of the month, Mexico had severed diplomatic relations with the new James Polk Administration, and Stockton's Squadron was ordered south to reinforce that of Commodore David Conner in the Gulf of Mexico. At the end of April, Stockton's ships sailed to Galveston, Texas where they stood by as a Texas convention voted on acceptance of the resolution. On 3 July, St. Mary's, detached from duty off Galveston, was ordered to join Conner's Squadron. On the 4th, the Texas convention approved the annexation resolution and St. Mary's headed east, to New Orleans, Louisiana, to escort transports carrying U.S. Army units to Texas. The troops, under General Zachary Taylor, were embarked on the 22nd and 23rd; and, by the 25th, were encamped on St. Joseph Island, near Corpus Christi, Texas. St. Mary's then stood by, off that town, as Conner's ships took station off Vera Cruz. In September, the Polk Administration attempted to reopen diplomatic channels with Mexico. Negotiations were carried on into November, when St. Mary's was called on to carry a new United States minister, John Slidell, to Mexico. On 30 November, Slidell was disembarked at Vera Cruz; however, after making his way to Mexico City, he was refused recognition by the Herrera government. Through the winter of 1846, St. Mary's continued to cruise in the Gulf of Mexico. In February, she carried dispatches between Conner and Taylor as attempts were made to pressure the Mexican government into reopening negotiations; but, in March, she arrived at the Ant√≥n Lizardo anchorage, whence she could institute a blockade of Tampico if the situation deteriorated into war. In mid-April, she sailed for Pensacola, Florida to take on water and provisions; and, by the time she returned in May, war had erupted. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, 1846-1847 On 19 May, St. Mary's anchored off the mouth of the Panuco River near Tampico. On the 20th, she proclaimed the blockade of that port and of the Mexican coast. In June, scurvy struck; but attempts were made to destroy Mexican gunboats and impede the reinforcement of the town's defenses. Through the summer, she maintained her part in the blockade; but, by September, the climate, disease, limited water and food, and relative inaction had taken its toll. Morale was low; and, on the 17th, Seaman Samuel Jackson was hanged for striking an officer and using \\"mutinous and seditious language\\". A little over a month later, her blockade duty was interrupted, and the sloop was ordered back to the mouth of the Panuco River. On 14 November, she participated in the unopposed occupation of Tampico; then resumed blockade duties. In late December, she was ordered to Brazos Santiago, whence, in January 1847, she proceeded to Lobos to cover the movement of General Winfield Scott's troops. In early March, she escorted the transports into the Ant√≥n Lizardo anchorage. On the 8th, she moved toward Vera Cruz; and, on the 9th, her boats carried assault troops to Collado Beach, where Scott's force was landed, without resistance, in under five hours. St. Mary's remained in the area through the end of the month to support the siege of the city. On the 22nd, one of her 8-inch guns, along with guns from other ships, was ferried ashore and placed on a ridge near Fort Santa Barbara to augment the Army's artillery. The bombardment of the city began the same day. On the 29th, the city was formally surrendered. St. Mary's then retired to Ant√≥n Lizardo, whence she sailed toward Alvarado to assist in the taking of that town. By the time she arrived, however, the town had fallen; and she resumed blockade duties. On 10 April, she had been ordered back to the United States by the Secretary of the Navy; and, in early May, she sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, carrying captured Mexican guns as cargo. Pacific Squadron, 1848-1872 The sloop remained at Norfolk for almost a year. On 11 April 1848, she sailed for duty with the Pacific Squadron; and, for the next five years, she cruised from the coast of California to the coast of Chile, in the Central Pacific, and in the Far East. In 1853, she returned to the east coast of the United States; underwent repairs at Philadelphia; and returned to the Pacific in 1854. During the next two years, she cruised in the eastern and south Pacific; and, in December 1856, she put into Panama City where a new crew under Comdr. Charles Davis relieved that of Comdr. Theodorus Bailey. From New Granada (Panama), Davis took St. Mary's to the Jarvis and New Nantucket Islands, then returned to Central America to stand by, off Nicaragua, as William Walker fought to keep his empire there. On 6 February 1857, St. Mary's anchored at San Juan del Sur, where she remained into the spring as Davis sought to negotiate an end to the fighting. In early May, Walker surrendered to Davis. Walker and the other Americans in his army were taken on board St. Mary's and transported to Panama City, whence they were returned to the United States. St. Mary's then resumed her cruise, collecting hydrographic and geologic data as she performed her other duties. In March 1858, she put into Mare Island, California, for a refit. Delayed, first by a lack of funds, then by desertions of shipyard mechanics and members of her own crew to the gold fields, she remained in the shipyard into the summer. In late August, she set sail again and headed south to cruise off Central America; and, in February 1859, her officers and crew were relieved at Panama City. She then sailed north to cruise along the Mexican coast as revolution spread in Mexico. In the fall of 1860, she returned to Panama City. There, with , she assisted local officials in quelling an insurrection. A few months later, the Civil War divided the United States. Through that war, St. Mary's remained with the Pacific Squadron, protecting Union merchant shipping and searching for Confederate raiders. After the war, she cruised the Pacific until September 1866, then put into Mare Island where she was laid up for four years. In the fall of 1870, she returned to active service; and, after a cruise to Australia and New Zealand, she returned to Mare Island, whence in November 1872 she departed for Norfolk. School Ship, 1873-1908 On 3 June 1873, St. Mary's returned to Norfolk where she remained, in ordinary, until 1875. Then transferred to the New York Nautical School at New York (now the SUNY Maritime College) she served as a school ship until 1908. In June of that year, she was ordered sold. Despite efforts of alumni to preserve the ship they could not come up with the funding. Two months later, she was purchased by Thomas Butler and Company, Boston, Massachusetts; and in November, she was scrapped.

It is sometimes cited as a precursor to the modern freeway, though when it was built the idea was that pleasure vehicles would use the upper level. It is the only street in the city that is prefixed with all four cardinal directions, albeit on different parts of its route. The drive is named for early 20th century, Chicago businessman and city planner Charles H. Wacker. The upper level is normally known as Upper Wacker Drive and the lower level is Lower Wacker Drive. A short part has a third level, sometimes called Lower Lower Wacker Drive.Brown, Mark. \\"Lower Wacker Homeless Coming to Uptown.\\" Uptown Update. Web. Retrieved 7 Feb. 2012. History In 1909, architects Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett drew up a plan for the Commercial Club of Chicago to unify the city's urban design and increase its physical beautification. The improvement of traffic flow in Chicago was a major part of the plan. Among its many recommendations was a double-decked roadway along the river, intended to relieve the congestion at River Street and Rush Street, where 50% of the city's north-south traffic crossed the Chicago River. Charles H. Wacker, chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission, pushed the idea. The original double-decker road, replacing South Water and River Streets, was completed in 1926 at a cost of $8 million and named after Charles Wacker. The 1926 section stretched from Lake Street to Michigan Avenue, the latter of which was also rebuilt into a two-level road. An extension south to Congress Parkway and Harrison Street was built between 1948 and 1954, replacing Market Street (after the Market Street stub of the Lake Street Elevated was removed). Extensions east were built in 1963 and 1975, with the latter taking it to Lake Shore Drive, and a new lower level starting at Stetson Avenue. At the time, Lake Shore Drive had an S-curve at the river, running where Wacker now goes between Field Boulevard and current Lake Shore Drive. This S-curve was on a viaduct over the Illinois Central Railroad's rail yard, and was at the level of Upper Wacker; the middle and lower levels dead- ended at that point. The current alignment of Lake Shore Drive was finished in 1986, and in 1987 Middle Wacker was extended to meet the new alignment. The ramps to bring upper traffic down had already been built; upper has been dead- ended where it used to end at Lake Shore Drive. Logo for the 2001‚Äì2002 projectIn 2001‚Äì2002, Wacker Drive was redesigned and reconstructed between Michigan Avenue and Lake Street. The original upper deck was crumbling, and the entire roadway did not meet modern standards for road widths and clearances. Using a specially-developed \\"flat-slab, longitudinally post- tensioned, reinforced, high-performance concrete cast-in-place system\\", the new road deck was expected to have a lifespan of 75‚Äì100 years. Walkways along the river were meant to make the drive more pedestrian-friendly, while restoration of historic limestone elements and reproduction lighting evoked the drive's original 1926 appearance. The 20-month, $200-million project was completed on time and within budget. In spring of 2010, work commenced on rebuilding the north-south section of Wacker, from Randolph Street to Congress Parkway, including the upper and lower levels. This is a continuation of the Revive Wacker Drive project started in 2001. Wacker is the only street to intersect both State Street (the east-west center line) and Madison Street (the north-south center line), although Lake Shore Drive and LaSalle Street/DriveLaSalle Street is principally a north-south roadway. North of North Avenue however, LaSalle Drive runs generally east-west, intersecting with Clark Street, Stockton Drive, and Lake Shore Drive. Dearborn Parkway, State Parkway, and Astor Street do not exist north of North Avenue; LaSalle Drive crosses State Street/Parkway's 0-E/W meridian while transiting the southern edge of Lincoln Park. also each cross both dividing lines. In April 2014, The American Council of Engineering Companies awarded the Wacker Drive and Congress Parkway Reconstruction project its Grand Conceptor Award. The project team was led by TranSystems and included roadway, bridge and tunnel improvement work. The project involved complex staging to keep 135,000 vehicles and 150,000 pedestrians moving through the construction zone each day. Intersections The following streets intersect Upper Wacker Drive, from south to north and west to east. Most upper-level streets that end at Wacker Drive, with only right turns allowed, are not included. The following streets intersect Lower Wacker Drive, from south to north and west to east. In popular media * The 1980 film The Blues Brothers used Wacker Drive as a setting. * The car chase scene in The Dark Knight (2008) was filmed on Lower Wacker Drive.

He worked together with Germaine Dieterlen and Jean Rouch on African subjects. His publications number over 170 books and articles for scholarly journals.  Biography  Born in Aisy-sur-Arman√ßon, Griaule received a good education and was preparing to become an engineer and enrolled at the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand when in 1917 at the end of World War I he volunteered to become a pilot in the French Air Force. In 1920 he returned to university, where he attended the lectures of Marcel Mauss and Marcel Cohen. Intrigued by anthropology, he gave up plans for a technical career. In 1927 he received a degree from the √âcole Nationale de Langues Orientales, where he concentrated on Amharic and Ge'ez. Between 1928 and 1933 Griaule participated in two large- scale ethnographic expeditions‚Äîone to Ethiopia and the ambitious Dakar to Djibouti expedition which crossed Africa. On the latter expedition he first visited the Dogon, the ethnic group with whom he would be forever associated. In 1933 he received a diploma from the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes in religion. Throughout the 1930s Griaule and his student Germaine Dieterlen undertook several group expeditions to the Dogon area in Mali. During these trips Griaule pioneered the use of aerial photography, surveying, and teamwork to study other cultures. In 1938 he produced his dissertation and received a doctorate based on his Dogon research. With the outbreak of World War II Griaule was drafted again in the French Air Force and after the war he served as the inaugural professor of the first chair of anthropology at the University of Paris - Sorbonne. He died in 1956 in Paris. Griaule is remembered for his work with the blind hunter Ogotemmeli and his elaborate exegeses of Dogon myth ( fr )‚Äî(including the Nommo) and ritual.The Dogon ‚Äì article at The Numo His study of Dogon masks remains one of the fundamental works on the topic. A number of anthropologists are highly critical of his work and argue that his claims about Sirius and his elaborate accounts of cosmic eggs and mystic vibrations do not accurately reflect Dogon belief. Griaule is the father of anthropologist Genevi√®ve Calame-Griaule (See :fr: Genevi√®ve Calame-Griaule).  Selected works  *Burners of men: Modern Ethiopia. Lippincott, 1935.

She herself was convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists in 2005, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. Her felony conviction led to her being automatically disbarred. She was convicted of helping pass messages from her client Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric convicted of planning terror attacks, to his followers in al-Gama'a al- Islamiyya, an organization designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States Secretary of State. She was re-sentenced on July 15, 2010, to 10 years in prison in light of her perjury at trial. She served her sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.Inmate 53504-054 Stewart was released from prison on December 31, 2013 on a compassionate release order because of her terminal breast cancer diagnosis. Early life and education Stewart was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Irene and John Feltham. Her mother was of German and Swedish descent, while her father had English and Irish ancestry. She grew up in Bellerose, Queens and graduated from Martin Van Buren High School in 1957. She attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan but left without a degree. Stewart graduated from Wagner College on Staten Island with a B.A. in political science in 1961. She earned a Juris Doctor from Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark in Newark, New Jersey in 1975. She was admitted to practice law in New York in 1977. Stewart believed that violence is at times needed to correct the injustices of capitalism. She stated that she doesn't \\"believe in anarchistic violence but in directed violence,\\" with directed violence being that which is \\"directed at the institutions which perpetuate capitalism, racism and sexism, and at the people who are the appointed guardians of those institutions, and accompanied by popular support.\\"Joseph Fried. In Muslim Cleric's Trial, a Radical Defender; Left-Leaning Lawyer and Revolutionary Sympathizer Comes Back in the Limelight. NY Times. June 28, 1995 Legal career Stewart was admitted to the New York State Bar on January 31, 1977. For much of her career as a lawyer, she represented a number of economically disadvantaged clients as well as more high-profile cases. Stewart was a self- described \\"movement lawyer\\" who took a wider interest in promoting the general political interests of those she represented, rather than only dealing with the specific charges against them. Stewart defended Weather Underground member David Gilbert, who was found guilty for his role in the 1981 Brinks armored car robbery in which two police officers and a security guard were murdered. In 1991, Stewart was subpoenaed to explain alternative fee arrangements with a gang member whom she had been defending on a drug trafficking charge. Stewart refused the subpoena and eventually pleaded guilty to criminal contempt in the second degree, a misdemeanor charge that would not result in her disbarment.Lawyer And Aides For Cleric Are Charged Radical Attorney's Biggest Fight Yet. NY Daily News. April 10, 2002 Another high-profile client was former Black Panther member Willie Holder, who hijacked Western Airlines Flight 701 on June 2, 1972; he claimed to have a bomb and demanded the release of Angela Davis and $500,000. Along with William Kunstler, Stewart represented Larry Davis, who had been charged with the attempted murder of nine NYPD officers during a shootout, as well as the murder of four Bronx drug dealers. Stewart and Kunstler secured Davis an acquittal on the more serious murder and attempted murder charges, but Davis was found guilty on a lesser felony weapon possession charge. After the trial, Stewart ended her relationship with Kunstler, feeling marginalized by Kunstler hogging the publicity of the case and not giving her due credit. Even Davis believed that Stewart was more instrumental in his acquittal, stating that \\"everyone thinks Kunstler beat the case. Lynne Stewart beat the case.\\"David J. Langum. William M. Kunstler: the most hated lawyer in America. NYU Press. Pg 307 Stewart also unsuccessfully defended former Gambino crime family underboss Sammy \\"the Bull\\" Gravano on ecstasy trafficking charges.Geoff Mulvihill. Mafia Boss Gets 13 Years Behind Bars. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. January 23, 2005. Stewart said that all her high-profile clients shared the distinction of being revolutionaries against unjust systems or were people whose cases expose those injustices. However, unlike most movement lawyers who found communications with prosecuting attorneys to be repugnant, former assistant US Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy found Stewart to be \\"eminently reasonable and practical\\" and commented that \\"when she gave her word on something, she honored it ‚Äî she never acted as if she thought one was at liberty to be false when dealing with the enemy.\\" Abdel-Rahman case Omar Abdel-Rahman After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the FBI began to investigate Omar Abdel-Rahman also known as the Blind Sheikh. The FBI recorded Rahman issuing a fatwa that encouraged acts of violence against US civilian targets, particularly in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area. Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993. The targets were the United Nations Headquarters, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge, and the FBI's main New York office at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. There were also plans to bomb Jewish targets in the city as well as assassinating U.S. Senator Al D'Amato and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. In November 1994, former Johnson administration attorney general Ramsey Clark met with Stewart and asked her to take Rahman on as a client after Rahman dismissed his court-appointed lawyer and his other lawyers, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, were taken off the case for conflict of interest. Stewart was reluctant at first, but Clark convinced her to take the case, arguing that otherwise \\"the Arab world would feel betrayed by their friends on the American left.\\" Interviewed by the Washington Post about her embrace of Rahman's case, she said, \\"my own political sense tells me that the only hope for change in Egypt is the fundamentalist movement.\\" Kuby, who had represented Rahman earlier, disagreed with Stewart's characterization, stating, \\"I love Lynne, but no one in the world could fairly posit the sheikh as a progressive or liberal on any issue.\\" Stewart contended that she understood fundamentalists because attorney general \\"John Ashcroft is one.\\" During Rahman's trial, she argued to the jury that Rahman had been framed for his political and religious teachings and not, as the prosecution alleged, for conspiring in any violent acts against the United States.Joseph Fried. In Muslim Cleric's Trial, a Radical Defender; Left-Leaning Lawyer and Revolutionary Sympathizer Comes Back in the Limelight, NY Times. June 28, 1995 Rahman was convicted of seditious conspiracy on October 1, 1995, and in 1996 he was sentenced to life in prison. Stewart reportedly wept when the jury announced its decision. Violation of \\"Special Administrative Measures\\" As part of Stewart's defense of Rahman, and her serving for several years on post-conviction issues, she was subject to modified \\"special administrative measures\\" which govern communications between suspects and their legal counsel. Stewart had accepted the condition that, in order to be allowed to meet with Abdel Rahman in prison, she would not \\"use [their] meetings, correspondence, or phone calls with Abdel Rahman to pass messages between third parties (including, but not limited to, the media) and Abdel Rahman\\". The special administrative measures, or SAMs, were modified in the wake of the September 11th attacks and were designed to prevent communications that could endanger US national security or lead to acts of violence and terrorism. According to a federal grand jury indictment, Stewart along with interpreter Mohamed Yousry, an adjunct professor in Middle East studies at York College CUNY, and postal clerk Ahmed Sattar passed messages between Rahman and his supporters in violation of the SAM, thereby conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of . The indictment also charged Stewart with violation of and , and making false statements (), and Ahmed Sattar with being an active Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya leader who served as a vital link between Rahman and the group's members. Stewart was accused in the indictment of passing Rahman's blessing for a resumption of terrorist operations to al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya members in Egypt after they inquired whether they should continue to honor a ceasefire agreement with the Egyptian government. According to video surveillance of Rahman's cell Stewart, Yousry and Rahman had been tricking the correctional officers into believing that Stewart and Rahman were having a routine conversation relating to his case, when Rahman was dictating statements to Yousry with Stewart joking that she should get an award for acting.Patricia Hurtado. ATTORNEY ON TRIAL, 'A secret ... channel', Prosecutors say lawyer for sheik imprisoned in '93 WTC bombing enabled client to communicate with followers who then carried out terrorist acts. Newsday. October 18, 2004 Stewart said that the dispute was over one communication on behalf of her client to his supporters via a Reuters article, followed by a clarification after it appeared to have been misinterpreted. The clarification said: \\"I [Omar Abdel-Rahman] am not withdrawing my support of the cease-fire, I am merely questioning it and I am urging you, who are on the ground there to discuss it and to include everyone in your discussions as we always have done.\\" The material-support charges were dismissed in the summer of 2003, but in November 2003, Stewart was re-indicted on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism. She was convicted on these charges. According to Judge John G. Koeltl, in denying Stewart's motion to reject the verdict as unfounded, > A rational jury could have inferred that, by relaying a statement > withdrawing support for a cessation of violence by an influential, pro- > violence leader of a terrorist group, Stewart knew that she was providing > support to those within the IG (Islamic Group) who sought to return to > violence‚Äîwho the jury could have found were participants in the Count Two > conspiracy, particularly Taha.UNITED STATES of America v.

Michael Tigar, her attorney, stated that \\"this case really is a threat to all the lawyers who are out there attempting to represent people that face these terrible consequences.\\" Supporters of Stewart alleged that the government charged her for her speech in defending the rights of her client. They believed that Stewart's efforts to release communications from her client were part of an appropriate defense method to gain public awareness and support. They also expressed alarm that wiretaps and hidden cameras authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were used by the government to gather evidence against her, which they called a violation of attorney‚Äìclient privilege. George Soros' Open Society Institute also donated $20,000 to Stewart's legal defense fund in 2002.Byron York Soros Funded Stewart Defense ; National Review Commenting on her case, human rights organization Front Line states that it \\"has had a chilling effect on human rights defenders who stand between government agencies and potential victims of abuses.\\" Conviction On February 10, 2005, following a nine-month trial and 13 days of jury deliberations, Stewart was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government (), providing material support to terrorists ( and ) and conspiring to conceal it (), and making false statements (). Co-defendants Mohamed Yousry and Ahmed Sattar were found guilty as charged. Her conviction meant automatic disbarment. Stewart remained free on bail pending the results of her appeal.Paul Vitello. Hofstra Polite as Lawyer Guilty in Terror Case Talks on Ethics. New York Times. October 17, 2007 Sentencing submissions FMC Carswell, Stewart's prison The original sentencing was to be in July 2005, but Stewart's defense team had repeatedly asked for and received numerous adjournments because she was receiving treatment for breast cancer. The defense team also argued that Stewart's age, problematic general health and cancer history could well mean that she would be in prison for the rest of her life if she were sentenced to serve several years. In a letter to the court dated September 26, 2006, Stewart stated that her actions were consistent with how she had always represented her clients but that she had failed to recognize the difference in a post-2001 United States and that, in hindsight, should have been more careful to avoid misinterpretation. Claiming that persons with 'other agendas' had misinterpreted her actions, she said: \\"I inadvertently allowed those with other agendas to corrupt the most precious and inviolate basis of our profession ‚Äì the attorney-client relationship.\\". According to The New York Times, Stewart \\"acknowledged ... that she knowingly violated prison rules\\". She requested that the Court exercise the sentencing discretion given judges by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. Booker, and impose a non-custodial sentence. The prosecution requested that the Court impose the maximum statutory penalty, saying, \\"We hope that this sentence of 30 years will not only punish Stewart for her actions, but serve as a deterrent for other lawyers who believe that they are above the rules and regulations of penal institutions or otherwise try to skirt the laws of this country.\\"Larry Neumeister. Lynne Stewart seeks non-prison sentence. Associated Press. July 8, 2006. Judge Koeltl refused both to impose the 30-year sentence proposed by the prosecution and to waive jail time entirely as Stewart had requested. He stated that while over her long career of representing unpopular clients, Stewart had \\"performed a public service, not only to her clients, but to the nation\\", her conduct was \\"criminal\\" in this case. On October 16, 2006, Judge Koeltl sentenced Stewart to 28 months in prison. Yousry and Sattar were sentenced to 20 months and 28 years, respectively. Yousry was released in 2011. Sattar is serving his sentence at the Federal Supermax prison near Florence, Colorado. Re-sentencing; 10 years In response to Stewart's appeal, a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed the convictions on November 17, 2009 and ordered the district court to revoke Stewart's bail immediately and take her into custody. The appeals court went even further: it remanded the case for re-sentencing in light of her possible perjury at her trial, and other factors the court considered had not been properly weighed against her by the sentencing judge. On November 19, 2009, Stewart surrendered to U.S. Marshals in New York City to begin serving the original 28-month sentence as prisoner #53504-054. Two months later, in January 2010, the full Second Circuit bench, in a split decision, declined to reconsider its panel's affirmance and re-sentencing directive. On July 15, 2010, Stewart was re- sentenced by Judge Koeltl to 10 years in prison, taking into consideration what he concluded were false statements she made under oath at her trial and other factors as directed by the appellate court. Lawyer Herald Price Fahringer contested the new sentence, bringing the case back to the Court of Appeals. On February 29, 2012, Fahringer presented oral argument based on freedom of speech, arguing that out-of-court comments on a public issue cannot be punished with enhanced imprisonment, suggesting that otherwise \\"no one will be able to comment after a sentence for fear that the same thing could happen to them.\\" This appeal later failed before a panel of judges, after finding no violations of free speech. Stewart filed a certiorari petition to the United States Supreme Court in February 2013. Health condition in prison Stewart's breast cancer returned after she was imprisoned. Scheduled for surgery for other problems the week she was sentenced, Stewart instead had to wait eighteen months for that surgery. In the meantime the cancer metastasized to the point that her attending physician called it the worst case he had ever seen. She received chemotherapy in custody. On June 25, 2013, Stewart announced that she had received a letter stating that Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Charles Samuels had denied her request for compassionate release. In December 2013, prosecutors wrote a letter to the judge stating that Stewart had 18 months to live. They said she had also been diagnosed with anemia, high blood pressure, asthma and Type 2 diabetes. On December 31, 2013, the denial of Stewart's request for compassionate release was reversed after Stewart's doctor said she had only 18 months to live. The Federal Bureau of Prisons and the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed a motion asking the judge in Stewart's case for a compassionate release. Judge Koeltl granted the motion, and on December 31, 2013, Stewart was released from prison. Post-release In September, 2016, Stewart was quoted on the assassinations of police in Dallas and in Baton Rouge. \\"They are not brazen, crazed, you know, insane killers . . . They are avenging deaths that are never and have never been avenged since the '60s and '70s.\\" Despite the medical prognosis of having an estimated 18 months left to live, Stewart died on March 7, 2017, aged 77, at her Brooklyn, New York home of complications from cancer and a series of strokes, according to her son, Geoffrey Stewart. Personal life Stewart was married to Ralph Poynter, and had a son, Geoffrey S. Stewart, also a lawyer, who lives in Brooklyn, New York.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is an active Roman Catholic parish church in the Archdiocese of Liverpool and the Pastoral Area of Liverpool South. It is the only Grade I listed Roman Catholic church in the Archdiocese of Liverpool. Sharples and Pollard consider it to be \\"one of the most imaginative churches of its date in the country\\". History The church was built in 1888‚Äì90 and paid for by the brothers Francis and James Reynolds, who were cotton brokers, at a cost of ¬£7,834 (). The architect was Leonard Stokes, the godson of Francis Reynolds. It is considered to be Stokes' \\"first really outstanding ecclesiastical design\\".Howell, Peter, ‚ÄòStokes, Leonard Aloysius Scott (1858‚Äì1925)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 8 October 2008 The foundation stone was laid on 25 March 1889, the church was consecrated on 3 June 1890 and opened for worship on 20 July of that year. The contractors for the building were Morrison and Sons of Wavertree. Architecture=Exterior The church is built in buff-coloured brick with Storeton stone bands and dressings, and is in Gothic style. Its roof is of slate. The plan of the church consists of a single vessel with a small north transept, long and low north and south chapels at the east end, and two porches, one at either side of the west end. Along the south wall are confessionals under a lean-to roof. The west face is simple with a large seven-light window. The porches are gabled; over the north doorway is a niche containing a statue of St Clare and in the corresponding position in the south porch is a statue of St Francis. The south chapel, the Sacred Heart Chapel, has its own saddleback roof and four round-headed five-light windows. The north chapel is the Lady Chapel and has a large west window of seven lights. The east face of the church is also simple and contains a short wide nine- light window, the outer two lights on each side being blind. The transept is gabled with one three-light window and a stair turret with a conical roof which gives access to the organ loft. In the angle of the nave and transept is a small octagonal turret with copper fl√®che. Interior Inside the church are internal buttresses which are pierced to form narrow passage aisles. The buttresses are linked by arches which support balconies. The interior of the church has ten bays with a wagon roof. The high altar dating from 1890 consists of a large triptych which contains paintings and relief sculptures by Robert Anning Bell and George Frampton. The stone pulpit was designed by Stokes and consists of four sides of a hexagon with openwork tracery. The font is shaped like a chalice and is made of alabaster with a copper cover. The marble altar rails, erected in 1933, stretch across the width of the nave and the chapels. Around the church the Stations of the Cross are oil paintings which were installed in 1892 at a cost of ¬£300. In the chapels are statues of religious subjects by Mayer and Company of Munich. The oldest stained glass in the church is in the Sacred Heart Chapel, the Sacred Heart window, which was installed in 1906. The Catherine of Siena window in the chapel was erected in 1912. The stained glass in the east window of the church, depicting the Crucifixion, was installed in 1908. The organ loft is situated above the Lady Chapel. The organ was built in 1892 by Steele & Keay of Burslem and was renovated in 1920 by Henry Willis & Sons.

Keillor wanted dialogue during the program and Keith was about the only other person around at that early hour. Keith was one of the primary sound effects performers for the radio show A Prairie Home Companion and was often an actor in sketches written by Keillor.

When Keillor left the morning program, Keith was joined on The Morning Show by Dale Connelly. He maintained the Jim Ed Poole persona and developed several other characters (like Dr. Larry Kyle of Genway Laboratories and B.

Signs and symptoms  The severity of the disorder can vary within the same family, with symptoms ranging from so mild as to go unnoticed, to severe heart and/or liver disease that requires transplantation. It is uncommon, but Alagille syndrome can be a life-threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%. The majority of deaths from ALGS are typically due to heart complications or chronic liver failure.  Liver  Signs and symptoms arising from liver damage in Alagille syndrome may include a yellowish tinge in the skin and the whites of the eyes(jaundice), itching (pruritus), pale stools (acholia), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). A liver biopsy may indicate too few bile ducts (bile duct paucity) or, in some cases, the complete absence of bile ducts (biliary atresia). Bile duct paucity results in the reduced absorption of fat and fat- soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), which may lead to rickets or a failure to thrive. Cirrhosis and eventual liver failure is fairly common among ALGS patients, and 15% of those with severe hepatic manifestations require a liver transplant. Hepatocellular cancer has been reported in a small number of cases, but it is extremely rare.  Heart  Tetralogy of Fallot is a common heart defect experienced in Alagille syndrome patients. Common signs of Alagille syndrome include congenital heart problems varying from heart murmurs to significant structural abnormalities, such as Tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary Stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy are common amongst Alagille patients. Patients may also present with Ventricular septal defect, Atrial septal defect, Patent ductus arteriosus, and Coarctation of the aorta. The mortality rate of Tetralogy of Fallot when untreated ranges from 70% by age 10 to 95% by age 40. However, complete surgical repair can significantly improve both longevity and quality of life in patients with Alagille syndrome.  Other  Other presentations of Alagille's syndrome include butterfly vertebrae, ophthalmology defects, and distinct facial structures. The butterfly vertebrae can be detected with an x-ray, but there typically are no symptoms from this abnormality. Other skeletal defects common in ALGS patients are spina bifida and the fusion of vertebrae. Most of the ophthalmological defects affect the anterior chamber of the eyeball, including Axenfeld's anomaly and Rieger anomaly, but retina pigment changes are also common. These anomalies can be beneficial in diagnosing Alagille syndrome. Many people with ALGS have similar facial features, including a broad, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a small pointed chin. While these distinct facial features are often presented in ALGS patients, the features are presumably not due to Alagille syndrome, but they are characteristic of patients with intrahepatic cholestatic liver disease. So while these facial characteristics are extremely common in ALGS patients, it is because many patients experience extreme liver complications or liver failure, but it is not caused by the disease itself. The kidneys may also be affected because the mutations in JAG1 and NOTCH2 often lead to renal dysplasia, deformed proximal tubules, or lipidosis caused by the hindrance of lipid metabolism.  Genetics  ALGS is caused by loss of function mutations in either JAG1 (Jagged1) or NOTCH2 (Notch homolog 2). In the majority of people with ALGS, the gene mutation occurs in the JAG1 gene. The JAG1 mutation is either intragenic and found on chromosome 20p12, or it is a deletion of the entire JAG1 gene. Mutations in NOTCH2 are much less likely to cause Alagille syndrome, but the primary type of ALGS-causing mutation in NOTCH2 is a missense mutation. A missense mutation is a point mutation that changes one nucleotide, which results in a codon that codes for the wrong amino acid. Alagille syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. The \\"autosomal\\" aspect of the disease means that the gene mutation occurs in an autosome, which is one of the 44 chromosomes in the human body that is not a sex chromosome (chromosome X or Y). Although the majority of cases are due to the autosomal dominant gene, there have been reports of a rare, autosomal recessive version of the disease. In the autosomal recessive case, the ALGS patient must inherit two mutated genes: one from each parent. Although about 40% of the mutations are inherited from affected parents, most cases result from new, acquired mutations. These are caused by environmental factors that mutate one copy of the gene. Environmental factors that can result in gene mutations may include radiation such as ultraviolet rays from the sun, or chemicals such as benzene, which is found in cigarette smoke. These cases occur in people with no familial history of the disorder.  Pathophysiology  JAG1 and NOTCH2 encode for proteins that are crucial to the notch gene‚Äìsignaling cascade. Specifically, JAG1 encodes for a surface-binding ligand that regulates the notch signaling pathway. It plays a crucial role in cell signaling during embryonic development. If the pathway is disrupted due to mutations, an infant will not develop properly. Alagille syndrome causes bile duct paucity, which is characterized by narrow and malformed bile ducts. Bile duct paucity causes bile to build up in the liver, resulting in scarring of the liver which hinders the liver's normal functions, like blood filtration and drug metabolism. The notch gene‚Äìsignaling cascade is also important for cell‚Äìcell recognition, which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life, and is specially important for: * Atrioventricular (AV) canal development * Ventricular development * Ventricle (heart) outflow tract development * Angiogenesis * Pancreatic development * Intestinal development * Bone development * Respiratory system development * Neuron cell differentiation * Neurite development * Gliogenesis * Adult brain function  Diagnosis  Alagille syndrome can be extremely difficult to diagnose. While people are born with ALGS, it is almost always diagnosed later during childhood. The diagnosis can be difficult because the severity of the disease varies widely among patients. Some common clinical tests that are run in order to diagnose the disease include vertebral x-rays, heart exams to detect any defects such as a heart murmur, and a liver biopsy to detect liver disease or any precursors. If a patient presents with multiple symptoms such as jaundice, heart murmur, and the characteristic facial features discussed above (deep set eyes, broad brow, etc.), they are likely to be diagnosed with Alagille syndrome. A more calculated and specific diagnosis can be done with genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing can be utilized to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the affected gene(s). Multiplex ligation- dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can detect large deletions and/or insertions and microarray comparative genomic hybridization is used to improve the accuracy of MLPA.  Treatment  Early treatment is possible once the disease is diagnosed. Treatments of Alagille syndrome typically involve medications, therapies, and/or surgical procedures. All treatments aim to improve bile excretion from the liver, reduce pain caused by the disease, and help improve nutritional deficiencies. Diet can also be a crucial factor in improving quality of life when living with ALGS.  Medication  Several medications are used to improve bile flow, including Ursodiol (Actigall or Urso). These medications differ in their rates of success. Certain drugs may be used to reduce itching (pruritus), such as cholestyramine and rifampin. While these medications can reduce pruritus, the itching often is reduced when bile flow is improved via Ursodiol or liver transplant. Many patients with Alagille syndrome have nutritional and/or malabsorption issues which often hinders normal growth. Patients benefit from vitamin A, D, E, and K supplements because the reduced bile flow makes it difficult to absorb and utilize these vitamins. A high-calorie diet is very important, and often requires a gastrostomy tube to maintain the high caloric intake.  Surgery  Surgery is common in more severe cases on Alagille syndrome, especially for patients with liver disease or end-stage liver failure. Liver transplants can either be a complete liver transplant from a deceased organ donor, or a partial transplant from a living donor. Liver transplants can be difficult in ALGS patients because heart defects are common along with the liver failure, and such intense surgeries are dangerous for cardiac patients because they cannot handle the stress of surgery and general anesthesia. Partial biliary diversion has been used to significantly reduce pruritus, jaundice, and xanthoma caused by poor bile flow in patients with bile duct paucity. A portion of the bile produced by the liver is directed through a surgically created stoma into a plastic pouch on the patient's lower right abdomen. The pouch is periodically drained as it fills with bile. Patients with biliary atresia may require a Kasai procedure to improve bile drainage; however, later liver transplantation is still often necessary.

History The castle's German name is derived from the name of the Hebenstreit family, who built the castle in the 16th century. It is located on a gravelly terrace above the center of town of Ravne na Koro≈°kem, on the Ravne plateau near the banks of the Me≈æa () river.[J. Mrdav≈°ic, Koro≈°ka osrednja knji≈ænica dr. Franc Su≈°nik, Ravne na Koro≈°kem, 1989] In the mid-17th century the castle passed into the hands of the Sichten family, and a foundry was established on the terrace beside the river. From 1700 on it was owned by the Gaƒçnik (Schlangenberg) family. In 1809 it was bought by the counts Thurn, who rebuilt it into its current neo-baroque form in 1863 and established the surrounding park. The historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor included an etching of the castle in his 1688 Topographia Archiducatus Carinthiae, the image likely reflecting the appearance of the original Hebenstreit building.Central Carinthian Library The castle's most recent renovation was conducted with respect to its cultural value. Since 1949 it has housed the \\"Dr. Franc Su≈°nik Central Carinthian Library\\" (). The Likovni salon (\\"Art Salon\\") shares the site, operating (under the auspices of the Ravne Museum) exhibits on the history of the town and the Me≈æa river valley, as well as regular art exhibits. Since 1969, artistic retreats have been held at the castle; as a result, the castle exhibits include a rich collection of paintings and small sculpture.Slovenia.info  References  Category:Castles in Styria (Slovenia) Category:Palaces in Slovenia Category:Museums in Slovenia ","title":"Ravne Castle"},{"id":"1492267","text":"Joseph Priestley \\"J.P.\\" McCarthy II (March 22, 1933 - August 16, 1995) was a radio personality best known for his over 30 years of work as the morning man and interviewer on station WJR in Detroit, Michigan. Early life J.P. McCarthy was born in New York City to John Priestley McCarthy. and Martha Mary Barber McCarthy. The family moved to Detroit when McCarthy was in elementary school. He graduated from De La Salle Collegiate High School in Detroit. It was there he started to perfect the art of conversation by participating in debates. McCarthy briefly attended the University of Detroit, participating in a co-op program with early aspirations to be a draftsman. McCarthy was drafted into the Army and was stationed in Alaska. There he got his first taste of broadcasting for Armed Forces Radio. During his early years in radio, he gained experience at KFAR in Fairbanks (as a part-time job while still in the Army). It was also there that he met and married his first wife, Sali Thompson. They would have five children together: John, Susan, Diane, and twins Kathleen and Kevin. Early radio career When his service was up, McCarthy returned to Michigan, settling in Flint. He got a job at Flint radio station WTAC. While at WTAC he frequently auditioned for WJR, a leading radio station in Detroit, with a 50,000-watt clear-channel signal that could be heard in much of the Eastern United States and Canada. After frequent auditions, McCarthy was hired by WJR as a staff announcer in 1956. The position of staff announcer was merely straight forward announcing, and McCarthy aspired to do more in radio. When Marty McNealy, the host of WJR's Morning Music Hall, left for WKMH in 1958, McCarthy was chosen to replace him. The station promoted him heavily, and he was soon the #1 rated radio show in Detroit. Sojourn in San Francisco WJR did not pay particularly well, and J.P. was offered the opportunity to do commercials for Stroh's, the top brewery in Detroit. Station management would not allow it, and after some discussion McCarthy left Detroit for KGO in San Francisco, where he took the morning show from #6 to #3. In 1964, Goodwill Stations sold WJR to Capital Cities Broadcasting and the president, Dan Burke, asked station manager Jim Quello why they lost McCarthy. After explaining the situation, Quello re- recruited McCarthy to return to WJR, with a raise and the right to do commercials for anybody he wanted. J.P. returned to WJR in December 1964. Glory and fame on WJR Upon his return to Detroit, McCarthy not only hosted the Morning Music Hall from 6:15 to 9, but also the Afternoon Music Hall from 3:15 to 6. Eventually, McCarthy's duties were relegated to morning drive, and a noontime interview program, \\"Focus\\". It wasn't long before McCarthy's morning show was #1 in Detroit, a perch that he held for about 30 years until his death, a feat unmatched in Detroit radio. McCarthy divorced upon his return to Detroit and soon after met Judy Buttorf, who worked at General Motors headquarters, which at the time were across the street from the Fisher Building where the WJR studios are located. They married in 1965 and stayed together until J.P.'s death. They had one son together, James (Jamie). McCarthy's morning show included a mix of music, news, and sports, but his greatest fame was as an interviewer (both on his morning show, and on \\"Focus\\"). One morning during the 1992 presidential election, he interviewed President George H. W. Bush and candidates Bill Clinton and Ross Perot all within one hour. Dick Vitale ‚Äì whom McCarthy was the first to christen \\"Dicky Vee\\" ‚Äì was a regular and friend of the program. Eventually, the music component of the show would be phased out so McCarthy would have more time to concentrate on the news of the day or any topic that would interest him. Former producer Hal Youngblood once said \\"Everyone is interested in what J. P. is interested in because he makes them interested in it.\\" His curiosity ranged between business, current events, history, entertainment, and other topics, and he could discuss any of these subjects with equal ease. McCarthy had a great love for sports, especially the Detroit Tigers. He interviewed Tiger managers Billy Martin, Ralph Houk and Sparky Anderson on his shows daily during the baseball season. In 1975, he served as a color commentator on WJR's Detroit Lions broadcasts. McCarthy occasionally had dialogue with a series of characters created by his friend Robert \\"Fat Bob\\" Taylor. Taylor, an aspiring opera singer who earned a living as a plumber, first appeared on the \\"Focus\\" show in 1966. Over the years, he developed characters like \\"Luigi at the Car Wash\\", and \\"Mrs. Pennyfeather\\" (a witty elderly woman). \\"Grosse Pointe Charles\\" (a snooty aristocrat), was generally believed to be Taylor, but, according to JPMcCarthy.net, was a real person from one of the \\"Pointes\\". Taylor would eventually host his own weekend show on WJR and the morning show at WAAM in Ann Arbor. He died in June 1995. McCarthy thrived on call-ins, which were rarely screened, with features like \\"The Answer Man\\", where he answered callers' questions in a comical voice, \\"Winners and Losers Of The Day\\", where callers would nominate local newsmakers for the winner or loser of the day, and \\"What's Bothering You?\\", where callers would gripe about what was in the news or issues like rudeness or unscrupulous businesses. But, most popularly, McCarthy would take calls from Detroit executives and celebrities who were his friends. McCarthy also was known for the stock phrases he would intersperse into his radio show. He opened every show at 6:15 a.m. with the greeting to listeners, \\"Good mornin' world,\\" and his phrases \\"They're playing golf somewhere,\\" \\"It's not the money, it's the amount,\\" \\"It's brass monkey weather,\\" and \\"Remember my name in Cheboygan -- just don't tell 'em where I am,\\" were only a few that endeared him to his listeners. Hobbies and interests McCarthy had plenty of interests, and he would easily discuss them at great length on his morning show, and generate a little criticism in the process. One of McCarthy's passions was golf. He played it frequently as an adult and was an authority on the game and its rules. He belonged to multiple private country clubs, and for a time served as president of the Bloomfield Hills Country Club. He had PGA golfers on his show and broadcast his show from many golf tournaments. One annual event that was dear to him was the annual fundraiser of the Detroit Police Athletic League, where he persuaded professional golfers to participate in pro-ams. Another McCarthy interest was sailing. He owned several private boats over the course of his life and would frequently chart courses on the Great Lakes. He even broadcast his show in 1987 from Fremantle, Australia, when American skipper Dennis Conner reclaimed the America's Cup from Australia. McCarthy would also broadcast his show live from the Tokyo Motor Show, Geneva Motor Show, and the Paris Auto Show, chatting with automotive luminaries and reporting on obscure European and Asian makes. He also hosted the televised charity preview at the Detroit Auto Show. McCarthy was proud of his Irish-American heritage. One highlight of each year was McCarthy's annual St. Patrick's Day broadcast, where he would invite local celebrities and politicians to drop by. The event began in the lobby of WJR at the Fisher Building and blossomed, until one thousand invitees showed up at the Fox Theatre in 1995. The broadcast is still a major event on WJR. Illness and death By 1995, McCarthy had dropped the \\"Focus\\" interview program from his duties to concentrate on the morning show. He had been in talks to take his program into national syndication through a production company he started with his producer, Michael Patrick Shiels. But in the early summer of that year, McCarthy began feeling rundown and tired. He had lost color in his face and was clearing his throat frequently. He also began experiencing bloody gums and nosebleeds. He sought medical help after he was too tired to go sailing over the Fourth of July weekend. Blood tests showed that McCarthy had a lack of platelets, and he was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition that frequently develops into leukemia. McCarthy continued to host his show for a short time, but he became more absent, until he left the air completely at the end of July. His plight became public, and soon bone marrow drives were held all over the Detroit area where thousands of people took tests in hope that their bone marrow would help McCarthy recover. In August, McCarthy flew to New York City where he was supposed to meet with doctors at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, but his illness had become so severe that he was admitted. J.P. McCarthy died of pneumonia in his sleep on the afternoon of August 16, 1995, with his entire family at his bedside. He was 62. The end Grief swept his fans in the Detroit area; McCarthy's remains were flown back to Detroit and the Detroit media gave the story extensive coverage. Two days after McCarthy's death, most radio stations in Detroit and Windsor, Ontario observed a simultaneous one minute of silence as a tribute to the local legend. His funeral was held with more than a thousand mourners in attendance at St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic Church in Bloomfield Hills. McCarthy was buried on August 19 at White Chapel Cemetery in Troy, MI. Further reading *Shiels, Michael. J.P. McCarthy: Just Don't Tell 'Em Where I Am.

He was a member of the Don't Make a Wave Committee in 1969, and a co-founder of Greenpeace in 1971 and its first president. He led the first on-sea anti-whaling campaigns in the world, against Russian and Australian whalers, which helped lead to the ban on commercial whaling. He campaigned against nuclear testing, the Canadian seal hunt and later, climate change with his book Thermageddon: Countdown to 2030. He was named by Time as one of the \\"Eco-Heroes\\" of the 20th century and is credited with coining the terms \\"mindbomb\\" and \\"eco-warrior\\". Biography Born in St. Boniface, Manitoba, Hunter's career in journalism began in the 1960s at the Winnipeg Tribune and the Vancouver Sun, where he focused on the counterculture as well as environmental issues. Beginning in 1988, he worked as a commentator and reporter for Toronto's Citytv and, since its launch, its all-news sister channel CP24. He created many documentaries about Canada's north that are still often aired on CP24 during off-peak hours. He was also the longtime \\"Enviro\\" columnist in Toronto's eye weekly. Environmental activism Robert Hunter was on the first expedition of the Don't Make a Wave Committee in 1971, titled Greenpeace I. This was a halibut seiner by the name of Phyllis Cormack, chartered to travel to Amchitka to attempt to halt the underground nuclear bomb test codenamed Cannikin by the United States military beneath the island of Amchitka, Alaska. The Amchitka test program was delayed, and, five months later, cancelled altogether.G+M: \\"Greenpeace co-founder's daughter makes peace with her dad, a decade after his death\\", 19 Jun 2015 In 1975 Robert Hunter led the Greenpeace expedition against the Soviet whaling fleet, along with lifelong friend and activist Paul Watson and Patrick Moore. The expedition chartered the Phyllis Cormack again, and pioneered using inflatable zodiacs as a shield between the harpoon and the whale. He participated on many Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society campaigns, and was on the advisory board for the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society for several years. A Sea Shepherd vessel was named for him after his death. Politics Hunter surprised many when he entered politics as a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party in a 2001 provincial by-election in Beaches‚ÄîEast York. Hunter's environmentalism had led many to assume that his politics were more in line with the New Democratic Party or the Greens, and he had frequently criticized Liberal politicians in his columns. The by-election campaign became bitter in its final days when sections of Hunter's 1988 travelogue On the Sky were faxed to Hunter's opponents. (The origin of the fax was never confirmed.) The excerpt were used by a New Democratic opponent, Marilyn Churley, to attack Hunter's personal integrity. In the end, Hunter lost by almost 4,000 votes to Michael Prue of the NDP. However, despite these results, Hunter in 2002 called for the Liberals and the Green Party of Ontario to form an electoral alliance. Author Hunter wrote numerous books on environmental subjects. In 1991, he won the Governor General's Award for literature for his book Occupied Canada: A Young White Man Discovers His Unsuspected Past. He also wrote on matters relating to aboriginal rights in Canada and remained in contact with Greenpeace and other environmental groups until his death. Death Hunter was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998. After his doctor told him that his prostate cancer was incurable, Hunter went to the Hospital Santa Monica, in Mexico, founded by Kurt Donsbach, an American naturopathic doctor and chiropractor. Hunter started treatment in December 2004, and reported progress, but died in May 2005.\\"Not without a fight\\" Simon Hayter, Toronto Star, January 21, 2005 His ashes were scattered in northern Canada near the Arctic on a canoeing trip, at Tortuga Bay in the Galapagos Islands, and on top of an Antarctic iceberg during the 2005/2006 Sea Shepherd campaign against whaling by the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. He is survived by his wife Bobbi, and his four children Emily, Will, Conan and Justine. Hunter had four grandchildren at the time of his death. Legacy In 2015 a documentary film was released at Sundance Film Festival titled \\"How to Change the World,\\" directed by Jerry Rothwell. The film is about the legacy of Robert Hunter and the origins of Greenpeace. A review by IndieWire says, \\"How to Change The World, director Jerry Rothwell unearths extraordinary footage to tell a story about fighting for a cause ‚Äî both by outlining the terms of the fight and the people engaged in it.\\" Bob Hunter Memorial Park in Markham was named in his honour. Part of the Rouge Park system, the park is bounded by a rail corridor, west of Ninth Line and east of Reesor Road, south of Highway 407 and north of Steeles Avenue East. The park was opened by his family and Premier Dalton McGuinty on August 21, 2006.

The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity (also known as Western Wisdom Teachings) is a Rosicrucian text by Max Heindel, first published in 1909.  Contents overview  The author talks about the true man and his journey through involution, spiritual evolution and epigenesis, presenting practical methods to help the development of latent potentials in each one of us and how to transmute our latency into dynamic powers in order to achieve, according to the author, direct knowledge and conscientious work in the inner planes. It deals with many esoteric topics and also metaphysics, physiology and cosmology (the visible and invisible worlds, human evolution, death and rebirth, nutrition, esoteric training, ...). It contains a history of the evolution of the human spirit and related bodies (from before awareness, through various incarnations of our planet on various planes, and into the future development) and of animal, vegetable and mineral life waves (the myriad life forms and types of consciousness on this physical plane, experiencing their own points in evolution). It also presents an esoteric interpretation about the mission of Christ and an occult analysis of Biblical texts which include the fall of man, the Law of Cause and Consequence and Bible and rebirth, and many other themes which were further developed in the subsequent books, lectures and lessons given by the author at the time (1910s) in the United States.  Main themes  The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is divided in three parts: Part I: the Visible and the Invisible Worlds, Man and the Method of Evolution, Rebirth and the Law of Cause and Effect; Part II: the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular; Part III: Christ and His Mission, Future Development of Man and Initiation, Esoteric Training and a Safe Method of Acquiring Firsthand Knowledge.  The Rosicrucian conception of God and the scheme of evolution  According to the Western Wisdom Teachings, in the beginning of a Day of Manifestation a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a Solar System for the evolution of added self- consciousness. The Ancient of Days, illustrated by William Blake (1794) In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of consciousness, from omniscience to an unconsciousness deeper than that of the deepest trance condition. During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness. The period of time devoted to the attainment of self- consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called \\"Involution\\". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience, is called \\"Evolution\\". Every evolving being has within him a \\"force\\" which makes evolution not to be a mere enfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called \\"Epigenesis\\", provides the element of originality and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God. The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception describes that in the Solar system, God's Habitation, there are seven Worlds differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another.Heindel, Max, The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception; Diagram 2: The Seven Worlds These Worlds have each a different \\"measure\\" and rate of vibration and are not separated by space or distance, as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of matter, of varying density and vibration (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical Earth). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin spirit becomes first human and then a God. The highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually condense and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the nadir of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as evolution proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.Heindel, Max, Idem; Diagram 8: The 7 7 7 Incarnations The Rosicrucians teach that the above referred seven Worlds belong to the lowest of the seven \\"Cosmic Planes\\". The Worlds and Cosmic Planes are not one above another in space, but the seven Cosmic Planes inter- penetrate each other and all the seven Worlds. They are states of spirit- matter, permeating one another, so that God and the other great Beings pervade every part of their own realms and realms of greater density than their own, including our world: \\"in Him we live and move and have our being\\". Proceeding from the physical world to the inner worlds, God - the \\"Architect of the Solar System\\", the Source and goal of human existence ‚Äì is found in the highest division of the seventh Cosmic Plane: this is His World. In order to trace the origin of the Architect of the Solar System, one must pass to the highest of the seven Cosmic Planes: the \\"Realm of the Supreme Being\\", Who emanated from \\"The Absolute\\". The Absolute is beyond comprehension and, as manifestation implies limitation, He may be best described as \\"Boundless Being\\": the \\"Root of Existence\\". From The Absolute proceeds the Supreme Being, at the dawn of manifestation: this is The One, the \\"Great Architect of the Universe\\". The first aspect of the Supreme Being may be characterized as Power, from this proceeds the second aspect, the Word, and from both of these proceeds the third, aspect, Motion. From the threefold Supreme Being proceed the \\"seven Great Logoi\\". They contain within Themselves all the great Hierarchies which differentiate more and more as they diffuse through the various Cosmic Planes.Heindel, Max, Idem; Diagram 6: The Supreme Being, the Cosmic Planes and God In the Highest World of the seventh Cosmic Plane dwells the God of the Solar Systems in the Universe.

Accessed in February 2005 *The Cosmo‚Äôs author has \\"an unswerving desire, a burning thirst for knowledge\\", which is \\"the first and central requisite the aspirant to occult knowledge must possess\\", but with this qualification, that \\"the supreme motive for seeking this occult knowledge must be an ardent desire to benefit humanity\\" (22). \\"Another prerequisite to this first-hand knowledge, however, is the study of occultism second-hand\\" (23). It is the purpose of the Cosmo to make that second-hand study of occultism possible. Occult science is the science of what occurs occultly insofar as it is not perceived in external nature, but in that region toward which the soul turns when it directs its inner being toward the spirit. *Heindel emphasizes the facticity of the Cosmo‚Äôs contents and the rigor and objectivity of his sources by using the term occult scientist(s) thirty times and occult science twenty-five times. The occultist (used twenty times) \\"knows\\" and \\"sees\\" what he is reporting on. \\"The occult scientist uses concentration in preference to prayer because the former is accomplished by the aid of the mind, which is cold and unfeeling, whereas prayer is usually dictated by emotion\\" (463).

It has little changed since then and it is considered to be Max Heindel's magnum opus. It is a reference work in the Christian mysticism practice and in the Occult study literature, containing the fundamentals of Esoteric Christianity from a Rosicrucian perspective. The Cosmo contains a comprehensive outline of the evolutionary process of man and the universe, correlating science with religion. It is, till current days, the basic book for the philosophy courses of the school, the Rosicrucian Fellowship, founded by the author on August 8, 1909.  The first dedicatory  The first edition of this work, containing more than 700 pages of in depth teachings into the major themes of the occult science, was dedicated to a knowledgeable lecturer of the occult field called Rudolf Steiner, to whom Max Heindel felt greatly indebted. It had the subtitle \\"Occult Science\\" instead of \\"Mystic Christianity\\" and just above the message and mission (\\"A Sane Mind, a Soft Heart and a Sound Body\\", \\"Service\\") there was a quotation from Paul of Tarsus: \\"PROVE ALL THINGS\\". In the subsequent edition, Heindel removed the initial dedication and changed the mentioned elements. The first dedication became a controversial issue among some students of both teachers down to the present. However, as both Heindel and Steiner appear to have been influenced by the same Elder Brother of the Rose Cross, to some extent and at some stage of their lives, it becomes an accessory issue that may only be unveiled through the discernment of the student along her/his path of spiritual unfoldment.

Emperor Yang's original name was Yang Ying, but was renamed by his father, after consulting with oracles, to Yang Guang. Yang Guang was made the Prince of Jin after Emperor Wen established Sui Dynasty in 581. In 588, he was granted command of the five armies that invaded the southern Chen dynasty and was widely praised for the success of this campaign. These military achievements, as well as his machinations against his older brother Yang Yong, led to him becoming crown prince in 600. After the death of his father in 604, generally considered, though unproven, by most traditional historians to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang, he ascended the throne as Emperor Yang. Emperor Yang, ruling from 604 to 618, committed to several large construction projects, most notably the completion of the Grand Canal, and the reconstruction of the Great Wall, a project which took the lives of nearly six million workers. He also ordered several military expeditions that brought Sui to its greatest territorial extent, one of which, the conquest of Champa in what is now central and southern Vietnam, resulted in the death of thousands of Sui soldiers from malaria. These expeditions, along with a series of disastrous campaigns against Goguryeo (one of the three kingdoms of Korea), left the empire bankrupt and the populace in revolt. With northern China in turmoil, Emperor Yang spent his last days in Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), where he was eventually strangled in a coup led by his general Yuwen Huaji. Despite his accomplishments, Emperor Yang is generally considered by traditional historians to be one of the worst tyrants in Chinese history and the reason for the Sui Dynasty's relatively short rule. His failed campaigns against Goguryeo, and the conscriptions levied to man them, coupled with increased taxation to finance these wars, and civil unrest as a result of this taxation, ultimately led to the downfall of the dynasty.  Background  Yang Guang was born in 569, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou. His parents were Yang Jian the Duke of Sui and Yang Jian's wife Duchess Dugu Qieluo. He was their second son, after Yang Yong, and he had at least one older sister, Yang Lihua, who became the wife of Emperor Wu's crown prince Yuwen Yun (the later Emperor Xuan) in 573. He was considered handsome and intelligent in his youth, and of Yang Jian's and Duchess Dugu's sons, they favored him the most. Sometime during Northern Zhou, on account of Yang Jian's achievements, he was created the Duke of Yanmen. In 580, Yang Jian seized power as regent after Emperor Xuan's death. In 581, he had Emperor Xuan's son (by the concubine Zhu Manyue), Emperor Jing, yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen created Yang Yong crown prince and created his other sons imperial princes. Yang Guang thus received the title of Prince of Jin.  As Prince of Jin  Also in 581, Emperor Wen made Yang Guang the commandant at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), in charge of the provinces north of the Yellow River. In 582, Emperor Wen set up a branch of the executive bureau of his government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) at Bing Province and made Yang Guang its head. He made the official Wang Shao () the deputy head and had him assist Yang Guang. Later in 582, Emperor Wen took a daughter of his vassal Emperor Ming of Western Liang (Xiao Kui) to be Yang Guang's wife and princess. It was said that Yang Guang loved and respected her. In 584, after some Sui military and diplomatic victories, Tujue's Shabol√ºe Khan Ashina Shetu submitted to Sui. Yang Guang suggested to Emperor Wen that he rejected Ashina Shetu's overture and launch a major attack on Tujue, but Emperor Wen refused. In 585, with Ashina Shetu under attack from one of his subordinate khans, the Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue, Emperor Wen in fact sent Yang Guang to aid Ashina Shetu. In 588, Emperor Wen moved Yang Guang's headquarters to Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), and made him the commandant there as well as the head the branch of the executive bureau established there. In winter 588, Emperor Wen launched a major attack on rival Chen Dynasty. Yang Guang, his brother Yang Jun, and the general Yang Su were in command of the three main prongs of the operation, with Yang Guang in command of the eastern prong as well as the overall operation. The key official Gao Jiong served as Yang Guang's assistant. In spring 589, the generals Han Qinhu () and Heruo Bi (), both under Yang Guang, crossed the Yangtze River and approached the Chen capital Jiankang. Soon, after Heruo defeated the Chen general Xiao Mohe, Jiankang fell, and the Chen emperor Chen Shubao was captured. Yang Guang, apparently fascinated by Chen Shubao's favorite concubine Consort Zhang Lihua, sent Gao Jiong's son Gao Dehong () to order Gao Jiong to hold Consort Zhang. Instead, Gao Jiong, comparing Consort Zhang to Daji (the wicked wife of King Zhou of Shang), beheaded her. Yang Guang thereafter resented Gao greatly, stating sarcastically, \\"It has been said, 'You should repay every good deed done to you.' I will repay Duke Gao later.\\" By Yang Guang's orders, several of Chen Shubao's favorite officials, who were considered reasons for Chen's downfall, including Shi Wenqing (), Shen Keqing (), Yang Huilang (), Xu Xi (), and Ji Huijing (), were executed. It was said that the people praised Yang Guang for his actions. Chen Shubao and his own clan members, however, were treated with kindness, and at Yang Guang's request, Chen Shubao sent letters to Chen generals who had not yet surrendered to persuade them to do so, and they largely did. Later that year, Yang Guang's forces escorted them to the capital Chang'an. At the ceremony to present Chen Shubao to Emperor Wen, Yang Guang marched into the palace first, and Emperor Wen bestowed on Yang Guang decorated wagons, horses, clothing, and jade. Afterwards, Yang Jun was given the Yang Province (then moved to modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) commandant post, and Yang Guang was returned to Bing Province. In 590, Emperor Wen swapped the defense posts of Yang Jun and Yang Guang, returning Yang Guang to Yang Province. In 594, Yang Guang urged Emperor Wen to offer sacrifices to Mount Tai‚Äîa traditional ceremony for emperors, but one that was rarely carried out. Emperor Wen rejected the elaborate traditional ceremonies, but did carry out a reduced ceremony at Mount Tai. In spring 600, with Ashina Dianjue, who had by now become Tujue's khan, attacking the borders, Emperor Wen sent Yang Guang, Yang Su the Duke of Yue, Yang Guang's brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han, and Shi Wansui () the Duke of Taiping, against Tujue, and they were largely successful against Ashina Dianjue, protecting the Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan, whom Sui supported, from Ashina Dianjue's attack. By 600, Yang Guang's older brother Yang Yong had lost the favors of Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu‚Äîover his wastefulness (which displeased Emperor Wen) and his having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). Yang Guang, by contrast, pretended to be frugal and loving only Princess Xiao. (It was written that Yang Guang did have concubines, but he pretended that he did not, and that he forced his concubines to have abortions if they became pregnant.) Yang Guang further inflamed Empress Dugu by informing her that she believed that Yang Yong was determined to kill him eventually. Empress Yang thus resolved to remove Yang Yong. Yang Guang further had his associate Yuwen Shu persuade Yang Su's brother Yang Yue () that, because Yang Su's relationship with Yang Yong was not good, that their family would be in peril should Yang Yong succeed Emperor Wen. Finally, Yang Guang also had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei () accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason. Emperor Wen had Yang Su investigate, and Yang Guang and Yang Su manufactured evidence against Yang Yong. Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang, putting Yang Yong under house arrest under Yang Guang's watch. Yang Guang later prevented Yang Yong from all attempts of seeing his parents again.  As crown prince  It is widely believed that Yang Guang also continued to scheme to secure his status as the crown prince. Such commonly believed tales include the followings. By 602, His brother, Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu, who, was commandant of Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and had great resources at his disposal. Yang Guang collected evidence of Yang Xiu's wrongdoing, particularly wastefulness, and had Yang Su submit them to Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen summoned Yang Xiu back to the capital and had Yang Su investigate, and both Yang Guang and Yang Su further manufactured evidence against Yang Xiu. Emperor Wen reduced Yang Xiu to commoner rank and put him under house arrest. Also in 602, Empress Dugu died. It was said that Yang Guang pretended to mourn greatly, refusing most foods, but in private continued to dine normally. In 604, while Emperor Wen was at his vacation palace Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), he fell ill and then died‚Äîa death, however, that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang (see below). Yang Guang, after sending Yang Yue to kill Yang Yong, announced Emperor Wen's death and took the throne as Emperor Yang.  Early reign  An immediate challenge that Emperor Yang faced was a rebellion by his brother Yang Liang, then the commandant at Bing Province, who was encouraged by the generals Wang Kui () and Xiao Mohe. Yang Liang received support from 19 provinces, but lacked a coherent plan as to whether to try to challenge Emperor Yang for the control of the entire empire, or just the region north of the Yellow River. After some initial successes, Yang Liang's offenses stalled. Emperor Yang sent Yang Su against him, and Yang Su proceeded quickly to Yang Liang's headquarters at Bing Province, capturing Xiao and forcing Yang Liang to surrender. Emperor Yang did not execute Yang Liang, but reduced him to commoner rank and imprisoned him for the rest of his life. In winter 604, believing in the words of the sorcerer Zhangchou Taiyi () that the geography of Chang'an was not conducive to his health, Emperor Yang went to Luoyang, designating it as the eastern capital, and would rarely return to Chang'an thereafter. He ordered that major construction projects be carried out at Luoyang, commensurate with the necessities of having it as the actual capital, and he left his oldest son, Yang Zhao the Prince of Jin, in charge of Chang'an. He conscripted several hundred thousands of young men to dig a lengthy trench to surround the Luoyang region, intending that it serve as a defense perimeter. He also ordered that women and servants be exempted from head taxes, and that men would only be considered adults (i.e., subject to conscription) when they turn 21. In spring 605, Emperor Yang created his wife Crown Princess Xiao empress, and Yang Zhao as crown prince. He also abolished the offices of military commandants. He, at this time, trusted Empress Xiao's brother Xiao Cong the Duke of Ju (Western Liang's last emperor) and made him, as well as many of her other relatives, important officials, creating him the greater title of Duke of Liang. Starting in 605, Emperor Yang also started a massive number of construction projects‚Äîincluding the building of the imperial palace at Luoyang, described to be particularly luxurious. Further, he conscripted a large number of men to build the Tongji Canal (), connecting Luoyang with the Yellow River and connecting the Yellow River with the Huai River, as well as to rebuild the Han Canal (), connecting the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The two canals, which would eventually become parts of the Grand Canal of China, were said to be constructed within five months, but at substantial cost of life‚Äî40% to 50% of the men employed. Emperor Yang also ordered that some 40 secondary palaces be built around the empire, so that he could visit the various provinces, arguing that he needed to do so to see the conditions of the empire so that he could govern effectively. In fall 605, after the completion of the Tongji and Han Canals, Emperor Yang carried out the first of 11 (counting military campaigns) tours that he would eventually undertake of various parts of the empire, going to Jiangdu‚Äîthe capital of Yang Province, where he had been commandant previously‚Äîon an imperial ship that was said to be sufficiently large and luxurious to serve as floating palaces. Also in 605, when Khitan tribes attacked Ying Province (ÁáüÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning), Emperor Yang had the official Wei Yunqi () requisition Tujue troops under Ashina Rangan to attack Khitan. The Khitan forces were caught by surprise and defeated. In summer 606, Yang Zhao the Crown Prince became ill while visiting Luoyang, and soon died. Emperor Yang would not create another crown prince for the rest of his reign, creating Yang Zhao's sons Yang Tan (), Yang Tong, and Yang You imperial princes, while initially apparently tacitly considering his second son, Yang Jian the Prince of Qi (note different character than Emperor Wen) the de facto successor, leaving Yang Jian in charge of Luoyang whenever he would be away from Luoyang. Yang Su, whom Emperor Yang pretended to respect but actually feared, also died in summer 606. Also in 606, Emperor Yang ordered that two massive food storages‚Äîthe Luokou Storage () and the Huiluo Storage () ‚Äì be constructed near Luoyang. In spring 607, Ashina Rangan visited Emperor Yang at Luoyang. Also in spring 607, at the instigation of Yuwen Shu, Emperor Yang had Yang Yong's eight sons put to death. In summer 607, Emperor Yang abolished provinces and changed them to commanderies. At the same time, he reorganized his father's governmental system of having five main bureaus, keeping four of the main bureaus‚Äîthe executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), the legislative bureau (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng), the Palace Library ‚Äì while abolishing the eunuch bureau and replacing it with the palace bureau (ÊÆøÂÖßÁúÅ, Diannei Sheng). He established three additional independent agencies and five independent departments. He also organized the imperial army into 16 corps. He abolished three levels of noble titles‚Äîthe counts, the viscounts, and the barons‚Äîkeeping only the princes, the dukes, and the marquesses. Also in summer 607, Emperor Yang embarked on a tour of the northern provinces, building an imperial highway from Chang'an to Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, the capital of Bing Province). He then personally visited the imperial tent of Ashina Rangan, whose display of submission and loyalty caused Emperor Yang to bestow much honor and wealth on him. When the senior officials Gao Jiong, Yuwen Bi (), and Heruo Bi privately expressed disapproval, Emperor Yang discovered their criticism and put all of them to death, while removing Su Wei, who also discouraged him from giving excessive rewards to Ashina Rangan, from his post. (Traditional historians attribute Gao's death to Gao's refusal to keep Chen Shubao's Consort Zhang alive in 589.) As Xiao Cong had a deep friendship with Heruo Bi, and there had been rumors that the Xiaos would rise again, the superstitious Emperor Yang also removed Xiao Cong from his post. Qimin visited Yangdi at Yulin. Also in 607, at the instigation of Pei Ju, Emperor Yang reopened relations with Xiyu states. In spring 608, Emperor Yang conscripted over a million men to construct the Yongji Canal (), from the Yellow River to Zhuo Commandery (Ê∂øÈÉ°, roughly modern Beijing). It was said that there were not enough men, and he started conscripting women as well. In 608, after persuasion by the Sui official Cui Junsu (), the Western Tujue khan (Ashina Rangan's western rival), the Heshana Khan Ashina Daman, whose mother was Han, submitted to Sui as a vassal. However, also in 608, Emperor Yang received a letter claiming to be from the King of Japan, Duolisibigu (Â§öÂà©ÊÄùÊØîÂ≠§, now commonly believed to be Prince Sh≈çtoku), stating, \\"The Son of Heaven where the sun rises, to the Son of Heaven where the sun sets, may good health be with you.\\" Displeased by what he saw as insolence, he ordered that in the future, \\"insolent\\" letters from other states not be submitted to him. Also in 608, initially over disputes over women (Yang Jian's having taken a concubine that Emperor Yang himself wanted) and hunting (Yang Jian's guards having been much more successful than Emperor Yang's guards at hunting), Emperor Yang's relationship with Yang Jian began to deteriorate. He ordered investigations into Yang Jian's violation of laws, and discovered that Yang Jian had used witchcraft to curse Yang Zhao's three sons. In anger, Emperor Yang executed and exiled a number of Yang Jian's associates, but he did not depose Yang Jian, although from this point on Yang Jian did not exert much influence on the political scene. In 608 as well, Pei Ju persuaded the Tiele tribes to attack Tuyuhun, forcing Tuyuhun's Busabuo Khan Murong Fuyun to flee. Murong Fuyun initially considered submitting to Sui, and Emperor Yang sent Yuwen with an army to welcome him. However, when Murong Fuyun changed his mind, Yuwen attacked him and seized much of Tuyuhun's people. When Murong Fuyun fled further, Emperor Yang had his forces seize Tuyuhun's territory, establishing four commanderies, to be populated with exiles.  Middle reign  In spring 609, Ashina Rangan made another visit to Emperor Yang, and Emperor Yang again rewarded him with much treasure. Also in spring 609, Emperor Yang ordered a redistribution of the farming land throughout the empire. Later in spring 609, Emperor Yang conducted a tour of the newly conquered Tuyuhun territory, and sent several generals to chase down Murong Fuyun. The Sui forces engaged Murong Fuyun's remaining forces, with mixed success, but Murong Fuyun was forced to flee to Dangxiang tribes. Emperor Yang tried to impose Murong Fuyun's son Murong Shun, whom Murong Fuyun had earlier sent to Sui as a hostage, as Tuyuhun's new khan, but the Tuyuhun people would not accept him, and Murong Shun was forced back to Sui territory. Emperor Yang also received 27 rulers of Xiyu kingdoms in an audience at Zhangye (ÂºµÊéñ, in modern Zhangye, Gansu). Later in the year, Ashina Rangan died, and was succeeded by his son Shibi Khan Ashina Duojishi. Pursuant to Tujue customs, Ashina Duojishi requested permission from Emperor Yang to marry Ashina Rangan's wife Princess Yicheng () (the daughter of a clansman of Emperor Yang). Emperor Yang agreed. Also in 609, Emperor Yang, jealous of the literary talent of the official Xue Daoheng (), he falsely accused Xue of defaming the emperor and had Xue strangled. By this time, it was said that Emperor Yang's lifestyle had become particularly wasteful, and that he no longer felt bound by moral principles. In 610, Emperor Yang visited Jiangdu again, and this time elevated Jiangdu's importance so that it effectively became a third capital. When Emperor Yang was visiting Ashina Rangan in 607, a messenger from Goguryeo's King King Yeong-yang to Ashina Rangan happened to be present, and Ashina Rangan introduced him to Emperor Yang. Emperor Yang ordered King Yeong-yang to come visit him, offering to reward him if he did so and to punish him if he did not do so. King Yeong-yang did not respond, and by 611, Emperor Yang, insulted by the lack of response, prepared a campaign against Goguryeo. With Sui appearing to be in its prime, both governmental officials and the people were initially in support of a campaign to conquer Goguryeo. In spring 611, Emperor Yang went to Zhuo Commandery and announced the campaign against Goguryeo. Several hundred men were conscripted, and it was said that even before they could get to Zhuo Commandery, disease and fatigue had already caused much loss of life. In response, a number of conscripted soldiers deserted and became agrarian rebels. Also in 611, angry that Western Tujue's khan Ashina Daman, while nominally submissive, had refused to visit him, Emperor Yang had Pei Ju persuade Ashina Daman's subordinate khan Ashina Shegui () to rebel against Ashina Daman, promising to give him a Sui princess in marriage. Ashina Shegui thus rebelled against Ashina Daman, forcing Ashina Daman to flee, first to Gaochang, then to Sui. Emperor Yang accepted Ashina Daman's submission, and thereafter divided his people into three groups, while leaving Ashina Daman as titularly khan, although he never allowed Ashina Daman to return to his people. By 612, the soldiers had been gathered at Zhuo Commandery, and Emperor Yang launched his attack, attacking a number of cities in Goguryeo territory, but targeting mainly at the important city of Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) and Goguryeo's capital Pyongyang. However, contrary to the desires of the generals, Emperor Yang ordered that their tactical decisions must first be submitted to and approved by him before they could be carried out. Thus all the Goguryeo forts and cities were able to withstand Sui forces and thus there was not much chance of Manchuria being successfully conquered. Emperor Yang, however, made a new plan to keep the Goguryeo forts at bay while sending another army, alongside the navy. to siege the Goguryeo capital. The navy arrived first and with a haste order, the navy attacked the capital but were defeated by ambush. The navy then waited for the land army to arrive. The supply of food had also been greatly delayed and many Sui soldiers died of famine. Then the Goguryeo General Eulji Meundeok rallied Goguryeo forces, and constantly harassed them with ambushes and feigned retreats. The Sui army had come to the Salsu River, but Eulji and the Goguryeo forces were waiting in ambush. A dam was made at the Salsu River to make the river seem it was shallow. When the Sui army was in the middle of the River, the dam was opened and many Sui soldiers drowned. Out of the 305,000 men that entered the river, only 2,700 soldiers escaped death. Thus the Sui army, or what was left of it, retreated back to Sui. This war had, however, resulted in devastating losses for the Sui in terms of soldiers, money and support from the people. In winter 612, Emperor Yang gave a daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Huarong, to Qu Boya () (the king of Gaochang) in marriage In spring 613, Emperor Yang again ordered that soldiers be gathered at Zhuo Commandery, as he prepared a second campaign against Goguryeo. He also selected the most elite of the soldiers into a specialized corps, the Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú, meaning, \\"the strong and brave\\"). Thereafter, the Xiaoguo Army became his own personal guards. In response to the conscription order, even more men deserted and joined the agrarian rebels, throwing the northern central part of the empire into a state of confusion. With the officials on command having little military training, the rebels went largely unchecked. One notable exception was general Zhang Xutuo (), who was able to defeat some of the rebels, but even he was not able to succeed in suppressing them. In summer 613, Emperor Yang crossed the Liao River again and put Manchuria under siege. However, at this time, news arrived that Yang Su's son Yang Xuangan had rebelled near Luoyang. With the people disaffected by the Goguryeo campaigns, Yang Xuangan received much popular support and threatened Luoyang. Emperor Yang, in fear, lifted the siege on Liaodong and also ordered the southern offensive to be terminated, returning to Zhuo Commandery while sending Yuwen and Qutu Tong () south to aid Luoyang. The general in charge of defending Chang'an, Wei Wensheng (), also came to Luoyang's aid. Together, these forces outnumbered Yang Xuangan's and dealt him several defeats. Yang Xuangan decided to try to advance west to capture Chang'an as a base of operations, but on the way was again defeated, and he had his brother Yang Jishan () kill him, to avoid capture. At Emperor Yang's orders, the officials Fan Zigai () and Pei Yun () carried out mass-scale reprisals, executing a large number of people who had followed Yang Xuangan. Around the new year 614, by Emperor Yang's orders, Yang Jishan and Yang Xuangan's strategist Wei Fusi () were publicly executed in exceedingly cruel manners‚Äîthe officials all fired arrows at them, and then they were further drawn and quartered, and then their bodies were burned and the ashes scattered. Around the same time, there were also rebellions south of the Yangtze River, and Emperor Yang sent the official Wang Shichong against the rebels. Wang was able to suppress the rebellions, for the most part, and thereafter began to rise in prominence at Emperor Yang's court. Meanwhile, Emperor Yang ordered that rebels' possessions could be confiscated at will. The local officials, however, used this as an excuse to execute and confiscate properties of those they did not like.  Late reign  In spring 614, Emperor Yang again proposed another campaign against Goguryeo. Although his officials did not approve, none dared to oppose him. Many of the soldiers ordered to report to Zhuo Commandery deserted. Emperor Yang tried to stop desertions by executing those who deserted, but still could not stem the tide of desertions. Goguryeo forces had also been constantly ambushing the Sui army and the Sui supply line. Goguryeo offered peace, for Goguryeo had also been exhausted. Goguryeo also returned Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (), who had fled to Goguryeo after his association with Yang Xuangan was discovered. Lai initially opposed ending the campaign, but did finally withdraw after ordered by Emperor Yuan. Emperor Yang executed Husi using the same kind of cruelty that he employed against Yang Jishan and Wei Fusi, but afterwards, when he again summoned Goguryeo's King Yeong-yang to meet him, King Yeong-yang again ignored him. Emperor Yang declared a fourth campaign against Goguryeo‚Äîbut he never actually launched it. Meanwhile, agrarian rebellions continued to rise. While generals such as Zhang Xutuo and Wang Sichong enjoyed victories here and there, the situation was deteriorating for the welfare of the Sui state at large. In spring 615, believing in accusations by Yuwen Shu that the official Li Hun () was intending to carry out a coup to replace Emperor Yang with his nephew Li Min (ÊùéÊïè, son-in-law of Emperor Yang's sister Yang Lihua the Princess Leping) and worried about prophecies that someone named Li would become the next emperor, Emperor Yang had Li Hun, Li Min, and their clansmen executed, and further poisoned Yang Lihua's daughter Yuwen Eying (). Later in 615, Emperor Yang carried out a tour of the northern provinces with the Empress Xiao and much of the imperial court. Shibi Khan, angered that the imperial advisor Pei Ju had promised a princess to his brother Ashina Chiji () and had executed his close advisor Shishu Huxi () under false pretenses, launched a surprise attack on Yanmen Commandery. In accordance with Turkish customs, Princess Yicheng had married him as her husband's successor; having been well treated by the empress during an earlier visit, though, she sent a secret warning of his plans to the emperor and his wife. The imperial train sought refuge at the commandery seat in present-day Daixian, Shanxi,. which Shibi Khan and his army put under siege on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. It was said that Emperor Yang became so fearful that he cried all day long while holding onto his youngest son Yang Gao, the Prince of Zhao. Yuwen Shu suggested that Emperor Yang take the most elite guards and try to fight out of the siege, but Su Wei and Fan Zigai opposed this. Empress Xiao's brother Xiao Yu suggested seeking further help from Princess Yicheng, and Emperor Yang did so. Meanwhile, at Yu Shiji's advice, Emperor Yang also personally visited the soldiers defending the city, raising morale by promising to end the campaigns against Goguryeo and to reward them with honors and treasure. Princess Yicheng falsely informed Shibi Khan that the Turks were under attack from the north and relief troops from Luoyang and the other commanderies began arriving, so the khan lifted the siege. With the danger passed and credit muddled, Emperor Yang followed the advice of Su and Yuwen to renege on most of his promises: he did not return to the capital Chang'an, but went to Luoyang instead; he continued to prepare a campaign against Goguryeo; he did not bestow any monetary rewards on the garrison or its reinforcements; and he was sparing in the promotion of the officers involved. When Fan and Xiao Yu reminded him of the promises, Emperor Yang rebuked Fan and demoted Xiao Yu. Emperor Yang only appeared to begin to be concerned about rebels when, at the lunar new year imperial gathering in 616, 20 odd commanderies' messengers did not arrive‚Äîeither because they had fallen into rebel hands, or because their messengers were intercepted or killed on the way. Only then did Emperor Yang begin talking about suppressing the rebels. Apparently beginning to consider the idea of evacuating to south of the Yangtze River, he ordered that a major palace be built at Piling Commandery (ÊØóÈôµ, roughly modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), and that another palace be built in Kuaiji Commandery. However, he did not like to hear news about rebels, and when Su expressed concerns about the rebels, Emperor Yang had Su falsely accused of crimes and initially was poised to execute him, but instead demoted him to commoner rank. By fall 616, Emperor Yang had resolved to go to Jiangdu, at Yuwen Shu's suggestion. A number of officials opposed, reasoning that if he left Luoyang, Luoyang would fall into enemy hands; Emperor Yang punished all, some with execution, and proceeded to Jiangdu. He wrote a farewell poem to the ladies in waiting in Luoyang, which included two lines that read: :I dream of Jiangdu's beauty; :And it was only occasional that I advance past the Liao River. Once Emperor Yang left Luoyang, Yang Xuangan's former strategist Li Mi, who by this point was advising the rebel general Zhai Rang, advised Zhai to directly assault the Luoyang region. Zhai agreed, and killed Zhang Xutuo in a battle; thereafter, the morale of the Sui troops became greatly damaged. Zhai, believing in the prophecies about the next emperor being a Li, began to honor Li Mi as his leader. Meanwhile, the Sui general Yang Yichen was having success against the rebels north of the Yellow River, killing Zhang Jincheng () and Gao Shida (), but Emperor Yang and his prime minister Yu Shiji, fearful of Yang Yichen's talent, ostensibly promoted Yang Yichen and recalled him to be a minister. Yang Yichen died soon thereafter, and the rebels north of the Yellow River reinvigorated themselves under Dou Jiande. By 617, several other major rebels had also emerged, including: * Du Fuwei, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern southern Anhui region. * Gao Kaidao, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern extremely northern Hebei region. * Liang Shidu, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern central Inner Mongolia region, declaring himself the Emperor of Liang. * Li Gui, formerly a Sui official, occupying the modern central and western Gansu region, declaring himself the Prince of Liang. * Li Yuan, formerly a Sui official (and Emperor Yang's cousin), occupying the modern central Shanxi region, announcing that he wanted to make Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai, then at Chang'an, emperor. * Lin Shihong, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern Jiangxi and Guangdong region, declaring himself the Emperor of Chu. * Liu Wuzhou, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern northern Shanxi region, declaring himself the Dingyang Khan. * Luo Yi, former a Sui general, occupying the modern Beijing region. * Xiao Xi, formerly a Sui official, a grandson of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, occupying the modern Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi region, declaring himself the Emperor of Liang. * Xue Ju, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern eastern Gansu and western Shaanxi region, declaring himself the Hegemonic Prince of Western Qin. * Zhu Can, formerly a Sui official, roving with his army in the modern southern Henan and southeastern Shaanxi region, first declaring himself the Prince of Jialuolou, and then the Emperor of Chu. By spring 617, Li Mi and Zhai had captured Emperor Yang's main food storages near Luoyang, the Luokou and Huiluo Storages, thus keeping their army well-supplied while making the Sui forces at Luoyang beginning to lack food. Li Mi took the title of Duke of Wei, while creating Zhai the Duke of Dong Commandery (although Li soon, fearful of Zhai, killed him and seized Zhai's army). A number of other agrarian rebels at least nominally submitted to Li Mi, including Dou and Li Yuan, and it was often thought at the time that Li Mi would soon be able to become emperor. Emperor Yang sent Wang to Luoyang to aid in its defenses, and Li's offensives stalled. Meanwhile, Li Yuan advanced southwest and captured Chang'an in winter 617. He declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong) while honoring Emperor Yang as Taishang Huang (retired emperor), and he himself wielded actual authority over the western Sui commanderies under the title of Prince of Tang. Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it was said that Emperor Yang's lifestyle grew increasingly decadent. His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women.‰ΩöÂêç ÁÖ¨Â∏ùËø∑Ê®ìË®ò The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, \\"There must be many people who want to hurt me. However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng [i.e., be like Chen Shubao], and you will at least be like Empress Shen [(Chen Shubao's wife)]. Do not worry. Let us drink and be merry.\\" It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, \\"I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it.\\" Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, \\"Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. Why be distressed?\\" Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (‰∏πÊ•ä, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. Their commanders Sima Dekan (), Yuan Li (), and Pei Qiantong (), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to hear about it. When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang‚Äîbut Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late. Meanwhile, the Xiaoguo Army officers planning the mutiny had by this time decided on supporting Yuwen Shu's son Yuwen Huaji as their leader. In late spring 618, they launched the coup. They entered the palace and surrounded Emperor Yang, accusing him of crimes. Emperor Yang admitted his faults, but pointed out that he had always treated them well‚Äîdrawing the response from Sima: \\"All of the earth is angry at you. It does not stop at just one man.\\" They killed Yang Gao on the spot to show him that they were serious. Emperor Yang offered to swallow poison, but none could be found quickly. He then took off his scarf, and the soldier Linghu Xingda () strangled him with it. The coup participants also killed a number of high-level officials and relatives of Emperor Yang, including Emperor Yang's brother Yang Xiu and his sons, son Yang Jian and his sons, grandson Yang Tan the Prince of Yan, Yu Shiji, Pei Yun, Lai Hu'er, Yuan Chong (), Yuwen Xie (), Yuwen Jiong (), and Xiao Ju () the Duke of Liang (Empress Xiao's nephew). The only close relative to Emperor Yang who was spared was his nephew Yang Hao, the prince of Qin, who was friendly with Yuwen Huaji's brother Yuwen Zhiji (). Yuwen Huaji thereafter declared Yang Hao emperor. Empress Xiao and the ladies in waiting, with no one else to help them, were forced to make makeshift caskets for Emperor Yang and Yang Gao using headboards from their beds. It was not until Yuwen Huaji left Jiangdu that the Sui official Chen Leng () buried Emperor Yang with reduced ceremony. In 622, after Li Yuan had established the Tang Dynasty, becoming Emperor Gaozu, and had somewhat reunified the empire, he reburied Emperor Yang with honors. The tomb was moved several times, and it was said that because of his immoral behaviour lightning struck the tomb wherever it was relocated.  Patricide controversy  While no allegations were made at the time that Emperor Wen's death was anything other than the result of illness, starting from the time of the succeeding Tang Dynasty, it was generally assumed that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders‚Äîalthough more neutral historians generally assumed it to be true while stating that there was no direct evidence. An example is the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, generally considered one of the most reliable, albeit secondary, sources in Chinese history, which, after mentioning Emperor Wen's death and giving a commentary on Emperor Wen's reign, then gave this account:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 180. More detailed versions of the story largely alleged that Zhang Heng personally killed Emperor Wen by pounding his chest and breaking his ribs. The advocates for the theory that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders also pointed to other circumstantial evidence, including how immediately after Emperor Wen's death Emperor Yang took Consorts Chen and Cai as his concubines. Further, after Zhang lost Emperor Yang's favors and eventually was executed in 612, Zhang lamented at the execution field, \\"What did I do for him that I can expect to live long?\\" The warden, apparently believing in the murder theory himself, immediately covered his ears to avoid hearing any details and had Zhang immediately executed. They further pointed out how Liu Shu and Yuan Yan were exiled and Yang Yong executed immediately following Emperor Wen's death. However, particularly in more recent times, some historians have questioned this theory. They pointed out that in the most official histories written not long after (the Book of Sui and the History of Northern Dynasties), no allegations of patricide was levied against Emperor Yang in either Emperor Wen's or Emperor Yang's biographies, or Zhang's, even though many other accusations were made of Emperor Yang's misrule. Indeed, they pointed out the origin of the murder theory appeared to come from the Daye L√ºeji () by the early Tang author Zhao Yi (), in whose version of the story, Consort Cai, not Consort Chen, was the concubine involved. They also pointed out that all of the circumstantial evidence had other plausible explanations‚Äîand that, indeed, why were Liu and Yuan not killed if they knew the truth? However, the idea that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders has become ingrained in the traditional Chinese mindset, although the truth might never be known. Tomb In April 2013 the tomb of Emperor Yang was discovered in Yangzhou. Two brick-lined tombs were discovered in the Hanjiang District of Yangzhou during work on a housing development. A stone epitaph found in the western tomb was inscribed with the title \\"Tomb epitaph of the late Emperor Yang of Sui\\" (), indicating that the tomb was that of Emperor Yang. It is thought that the other tomb may be that of the emperor's consort, but it has not been properly excavated yet. The tomb is 4.98 √ó 5.88 meters in dimension, which is smaller than many non-royal tombs of the period. The reason for the tomb's small size according to Chinese archaeologists is that the emperor died suddenly when he escaped to Yangzhou during a coup, and there was no time to build a grand tomb. The top of the tomb had been damaged by later buildings built on top of it, and the tomb had been robbed in antiquity. No coffin or human remains have been found in the tomb, but a number of artefacts have been recovered, including a pair of lion-shaped gold- inlaid iron door-knockers and a jade belt with gold decoration. Arts Emperor Yang was also a patron of the arts, having expanded the number of foreign orchestras (from across Asia) at the Sui court from seven to nine. He was, in fact, quite a gifted artist himself, but one prone to horrible fits of jealousy and stubbornness, who seldom listened to the advice of more talented individuals. He was a talented poet but killed two poets after he found their stanzas to be superior to his own.ÂäâÈ§ó ÈöãÂîêÂòâË©±  Era name  * Daye (Â§ßÊ•≠ d√† y√®) 605‚Äì618 Family * Parents: ** Yang Jian, Emperor Wen (; 541‚Äì604) ** Empress Wenxian, of the Dugu clan of Henan (; 544‚Äì602), personal name Jialuo () * Consorts and Issue: ** Empress Min, of the Xiao clan of Lanling (; 567‚Äì647) *** Yang Zhao, Emperor Xiaocheng (; 584‚Äì606), first son *** Yang Jian, Prince of Qi (; 585‚Äì618), second son *** Princess Nanyang (; 586‚Äì630), first daughter **** Married Yuwen Shiji, Duke Xincheng (572‚Äì642) in 599, and had issue (one son) ** Pin, of the Xiao clan () *** Yang Gao, Prince of Zhao (; 607‚Äì618), fourth son ** Unknown *** A daughter who married Li Shimin of Longxi (; 598‚Äì649), and had issue (two sons including Li Ke) Descendants *15px Yang Guang, Emperor Yang of Sui **Yang Zhao () (584‚Äì606) ***Yang Dan () (603‚Äì618), Prince of Yan (), Zhao's son with Lady Liu the Elder (), killed under Yuwen Huaji's order ***15px Lord Huangtai () (604‚Äì619), personal name Yang Tong (), Zhao's son with Lady Liu the Younger (Â∞èÂäâËâØÂ®£), bestowed by Wang Shichong as Emperor Gong (), later killed under Wang's order ***15px Emperor Gong () (605‚Äì618), personal name Yang You (), Zhao's son with Consort Wei (Èü¶Â¶É), died after his abdication in favor of Li Yuan, Imperial Duke of Tang **Yang Jian () (585‚Äì618) ***Two elder sons, murdered by Yuwen Huaji in 618 ***Yang Zhengdao (Êù®ÊîøÈÅì) (618/619‚Äì690s), later given the office of Yuanwai sanqi shilang (ÂëòÂ§ñÊï£È™ë‰æçÈÉé) in Tang dynasty **** Yang Chongli (Êù®Â¥áÁ§º) (?‚Äì?), given the office of Minister of Palace Supplies (Â§™Â∫úÂçø), Minister of Revenue (Êà∑ÈÉ®Â∞ö‰π¶) ***** Yang Shenming () (?‚Äì747), forced to suicide with his brothers by Emperor Xuanzong ***** Yang Shenjin (Êù®ÊÖéÁüú) (?‚Äì747), given the office of Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û), conspiring against other Tang officials, later forced to suicide with his brothers by Emperor Xuanzong ***** Yang Shenyu () (?‚Äì747), forced to suicide with his brothers by Emperor Xuanzong ***** One daughter, married Xin Mou () ****** Xin Jingcou (ËæõÊôØÂáë) (?‚Äì?) ***One daughter with Lady Wei () **Princess Nanyang () (586‚Äì630) ***Yuwen Chanshi () (?‚Äì619), son with Yuwen Shiji, executed with his uncles under Dou Jiande's order **Consort Yang () ***Li Ke (ÊùéÊÅ™) (619‚Äì653), Prince of Wu (), married Lady Yang, a daughter of Yang Yu (Êù®Ë™â) and sister of Yang Chongjing (Êù®Â¥áÊï¨) ****Li Qianli (ÊùéÂçÉÈáå) (645/646?‚Äì708), courtesy name Ren (), Prince of Cheng (), married Murong Zhenruhai () (651‚Äì726), a descendant of Northern Yan royalty *****Li Xi (ÊùéÁ¶ß) (?‚Äì?), Prince of Tianshui Commandery (Â§©Ê∞¥ÈÉ°Áéã) ****Li Wei (ÊùéÁéÆ) (647‚Äì642), posthumously promoted as Prince of Langling Commandery (), married Lady Feng, great-granddaughter of Feng Ang () the Imperial Duke of Jing (), descendant of the Nanyue people *****Li Zuo (ÊùéÁ•ö) (?‚Äì?), Prince of Langling Commandery *****Li Xuan (ÊùéË¢®) (?‚Äì?), other name Li Yu (ÊùéË§ï), Prince Sishu (Âó£ËúÄÁéã) ****Li Kun (ÊùéÁê®) (?‚Äì702), Prince of Wu *****Li Yi (ÊùéÁ•é) (?‚Äì743), Prince of Xin'an Commandery (), married Lady L√º () ******Li Huan (ÊùéÂ≥ò) (?‚Äì?), Imperial Duke of Zhao (ËµµÂõΩÂÖ¨) ******Li Yi (ÊùéÂ≥Ñ) (?‚Äì?) ******Li Xian (ÊùéÂ≤ò) (708‚Äì766), Imperial Duke of Liang () *****Li Ru (ÊùéË•¶) (?‚Äì?), Imperial Duke of Bi (ÊØïÂõΩÂÖ¨) *****Li Duan (ÊùéË§ç) (?‚Äì?) *****Li Zhi (ÊùéÁ•ó) (?‚Äì?), Prince Siwu (Âó£Âê¥Áéã) ******Li Hu (ÊùéÂ≤µ) (?‚Äì?) ******Li Yan (ÊùéÂ∑ò) (?‚Äì?), Prince Siwu *******Li Zhou (ÊùéÂÆô) (?‚Äì?), Prince Siwu *****Li Gui (ÊùéË¢ø) (?‚Äì?) ****Li Jing (ÊùéÁíÑ) (?‚Äì?), Prince of Guizheng Commandery (ÂΩíÊîøÈÉ°Áéã) *****Li Gui (ÊùéË•ò) (?‚Äì?) ****Princess of Xin'an County (‰ø°ÂÆâÂéø‰∏ª) (648‚Äì716), married Yuan Sizhong (ÂÖÉÊÄùÂø†), descendant of Tuoba Huang, prince of Northern Wei *****Yuan Shouyi (ÂÖÉÂÆà‰∏Ä) (?‚Äì?) *****Yuan Guan (ÂÖÉÁìò) (?‚Äì?) *****Yuan Gui (ÂÖÉÁìå) (?‚Äì?) ****Li Hua (ÊùéÂçé) (650‚Äì715), Princess of Xuancheng County (ÂÆ£ÂüéÂéø‰∏ª) ***Li Yin (ÊùéÊÑî) (620?‚Äì667), Prince of Shu () ****Li Fan () (?‚Äì689), Prince Sishu () ****Li Chou () (?‚Äì689), Prince of Guangdou Commandery () ****Li Jin (ÊùéÁëæ) (?‚Äì?), Prince of Jiangling Commandery (Ê±üÈôµÈÉ°Áéã) ****Princess of Bao'an County (ÂÆùÂÆâÂéø‰∏ª) (?‚Äì?), married Cui Sigu (Â¥îÊÄùÂè§) *****Cui Zikan (Â¥îÂ≠êÂÅò) (?‚Äì?), chariot servant (ËæáÈÉé) of Gaozong ** (?)

As the name suggests, they were founded in lieu of a vocational school to train government employed imams; after madrasas in Turkey were abolished by the Unification of Education Act () as a part of \\"Atat√ºrk's reforms\\". History During the Ottoman Empire, a key objective of education was to raise 'good Muslims'. Thus there was a need for Islamic scholars, which was sustained through Islamic Theology Schools, called Madrasa.The study of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (tr: T√ºrkiye Ekonomik ve Sosyal Et√ºdler Vakfƒ± called ƒ∞mam Hatip Liseleri: Efsaneler ve Ger√ßekler (Imam Hatip Schools: Legend and Reality) was published in October 2004. The 268-page document has an English summary (pages 39-53) and can be downloaded as PDF-file; accessed on 7 November 2012 In 1913, the Medreset√º-l Eimmeti vel Hutaba (School of ministers and preachers ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¶ŸÖÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∑ÿ®ÿßÿ°) and Medreset√º-l Vaazin (Schools for Preachers ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿßÿπÿ∏ŸäŸÜ) were combined to form the tangible origins of today's Imam Hatip high schools. In 1924, the Tevhid-i Tedrisat (Law of Unification of Educational Instruction ÿ™Ÿàÿ≠ŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿØÿ±Ÿäÿ≥ÿßÿ™) was passed, replacing the existing, mostly sectarian educational system with a secular, centralist and nationalist education one. The new law brought all educational institutions under the control of the Ministry of National Education. A Faculty of Theology at the Dar√ºlf√ºnun (Istanbul University), special schools for training imams and hatips (ministers and preachers) were opened by the new Ministry of National Education. However, in 1930 ƒ∞mam Hatip schools were closed and 1933 the Faculty of Divinity was abolished. In contrast to the exclusively secularist nature of the education policy of the Republican People's Party (CHP) religious education was reinstated in 1948. This included the establishment of a Faculty of Theology at the University of Ankara in 1949. First steps for the establishment of Imam Hatip schools began in 1951 under the Democrat Party government, which set up seven special secondary schools (Imam Hatip Okullarƒ±). In addition, in 1959 Islamic Institutes were opened for graduates of Imam Hatip schools. Following the coup d'etat in 1960, Imam Hatip schools encountered the threat of closure. Following the return to civilian politics and the introduction of the new constitution in 1961, graduates of Imam Hatip schools could only enrol in university programmes if they had passed courses offered at secular schools. During the premiership of S√ºleyman Demirel however, graduates of Imam Hatip schools were given access to university without such requirements. The 1971 Turkish coup d'√©tat introduced two key reforms: firstly junior high Imam Hatip schools were abolished, and in 1973 Imam Hatip schools were renamed as Imam Hatip high schools. Under the subsequent National Education Basic Law, Imam Hatip schools were defined as vocational schools, where students were to be trained as preachers and ministers or prepared for higher education. Imam Hatip schools grew slowly at first, but their numbers expanded rapidly to 334 during the 1970s. The coalition government of 1974, established by the CHP and the MSP (National Salvation Party), committed to reopen junior high schools and giving the right of entry to university through examination. 230 new Imam Hatip high schools were opened in a period of nearly four years. During the 1974-75 school year the number of students attending to the Imam Hatip high schools grew to 48,895. This number subsequently grew to 200,300 by 1980-81. In addition, females gained the right of entry to Imam Hatip high schools in 1976. The proliferation of Imam Hatip high schools is often cited as the effect of the National Salvation Party's membership of a number of coalitions with Nationalist Front governments. Situation since 1980 The coup d'etat of September 12, 1980 is a critical turning point in the history of Turkey and also for the history of ƒ∞mam-Hatip high schools. Under military governance, graduates of Imam Hatip high schools gained the right of entry to all university departments. In 1985, two new Imam Hatip high schools opened, one in Tunceli, despite of the so-called ethnic structure of the region, and the other in Beykoz as an Anatolian Imam Hatip High School, with the aim of contributing to the education of children of families who work abroad. Although the number of Imam Hatip high schools had not increased since, the number of students attending Imam Hatip high schools has increased by 45%. This is partly due to the improvement in the quality of Imam Hatip high schools and the education offered at such schools. During the education year of 1973-74, the total number of Imam Hatip students was 34,570; in 1997 this number had sharply increased to reach 511,502. Alongside this massive increase in popularity, the number of schools also increased. The number of Imam Hatip junior high schools reached 601 and senior high schools 402. The increase in both student and school numbers can be attributed to factors including the commitment of people to religion, dormitory facilities, scholarships, the admittance of females and an increase in demand for religious education. Research suggests that between the years of 1993 and 2000, prospective students registered at Imam Hatip high schools primarily to receive religious tutoring alongside a more general education.The TESEV reports cites studies of Suat Cebeci (1993), T√ºrkmen (1998), √únl√º (1998)and Altunsaray (2000) In addition, research shows enrolment at Imam Hatip high schools was based solely on the student's decision. The third proposed factor in the rise in popularity of Imam Hatip schools is the admission of female students in 1976. By 1998, almost 100,000 females attended Imam Hatip high schools, making up almost half of all students. This statistic is particularly revealing because women are not eligible to become either priests or ministers. However, the introduction of eight years of compulsory education in 1997 has seen a sudden decline in the popularity of Imam Hatip schools. In 1999, the reclassification of Imam Hatip schools as \\"vocational schools\\" meant that, although more options had been made available to graduates, attaining places at prestigious university courses became more difficult. By requiring that all eight compulsory years of schooling be spent under the same primary-school roof, middle schools were abolished. Children could not enter vocational schools (one of them the Imam Hatip school) until the ninth grade (rather than the sixth, as before).See an article by Andrew Finkel in the International Herald Tribune of 23 March 2012 What‚Äôs 4 + 4 + 4?; accessed on 7 November 2012 By the mid-1990s, Imam Hatip schools were attracting some 11 percent of children in the relevant age group and developing into a parallel system of education. When the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, only about 2 percent of eligible children attended clerical schools. The reform in education introduced in March 2012 extended mandatory schooling to 12 years and divided into four years of primary school, four years of middle school and four years of high school. In 2002 attendance at imam hatip schools was about 60,000; by 2017 this number had increased to over 1.1 million (about 10% of all public- school students). Pro-imam hatip school reforms undertaken by the AKP government include reducing the minimum population requirement for areas where the schools are allowed to open from 50,000 to 5,000 and lowering the age at which children can enter them from fourteen to ten. Criticism Since their creation in the 1950s, Imam Hatips have been controversial in the debate about Turkey's secular state.See an article in Voice of America of 25 September 2012 In Turkey, Religious Schools Gain a Foothold; accessed on 7 November 2012 Kenan Cayir, assistant professor of sociology at Istanbul's Bilgi University, says the schools can have a positive impact so that religion and \\"modernity\\" can be together with government secularism or atheism. An objection to the free choice of Imam Hatip graduates came from T√úSIAD (Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association). According to their research conducted in 1988, approximately 32% of graduates of Imam Hatip schools picked faculties of law as their first choice in university entrance exams, proving more popular than religious based alternatives. The report concluded that, due to fundamental differences in their upbringing, Imam Hatip graduates were rendered unsuitable for public office. Politicians tended not to agree with T√úSIAD's position. For example, the then Minister of National Education, Avni Akyol, criticised the report in terms of human rights, claiming such proposals undermined the principle of equal opportunity in education. Following the reforms of March 2012 that extended compulsory education to 12 years and allowed for Imam Hatip schools to be opened and \\"middle school\\" level (second term of four years) experts warned that the possible increase in the number of Imam Hatip schools was not in line with people‚Äôs expectations and described it as a ‚Äútop-down‚Äù process. Critics noted that the new education system seemed to be a revenge being taken for Imam Hatip schools that were shut down after 1997.See an article in Today's Zaman of 2 September 2012 Turkey to launch new Imam Hatip school for international students; accessed on 7 November 2012 A survey conducted by the Turkey ƒ∞mam-Hatip Alumni Foundation (Tƒ∞MAV), revealed that the majority of Turks hold positive views about Imam Hatip schools. The survey, titled ‚ÄúPerception of ƒ∞mam-Hatip High Schools and ƒ∞mam-Hatip Students in Turkey,‚Äù was conducted between April 24 and May 18, 2012 with 2,689 people in 26 provinces. Most of the respondents were not Imam Hatip graduates. The bill of March 2012 was written without public debate ‚Äî or even discussion in the education ministry‚Äôs own consultative body, the National Education Council ‚Äî and it did not figure in the government‚Äôs 2011 election manifesto. According to education specialists, the new measures would undermine educational standards and deepen social inequalities. The education faculties of most of Turkey‚Äôs leading universities ‚Äî including Sabanci University, Bosphorus University, Middle East Technical University and Ko√ß University all issued press statements describing the reforms of 2012 as \\"hastily conceived, retrograde and out of step with current thinking\\".

From his laqab or honorific title Sayf ad-Din (\\"Sword of Faith\\"), he was known to the Crusaders as Saphadin, a name by which he is still called in the Western world. A gifted and effective administrator and organizer,From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193‚Äì1260 by R. Stephen Humphreys, SUNY Press 1977, p. 155 Al-Adil provided crucial military and civilian support for the great campaigns of his brother Saladin (an early example of a great minister of war). He was also a capable general and strategist in his own right, and the foundation and persistence of the Ayyubid state was as much his achievement as it was Saladin's.  Early life  Al-Adil was a son of Najm ad-Din Ayyub, and a younger brother of Salah ad- Din Ayyubi. He was born in June 1145, possibly in Damascus. He first achieved distinction as an officer in Nur ad-Din Zengi's army during his uncle Shirkuh's third and final campaign in Egypt (1168‚Äì1169); following Nur ad- Din's death in 1174, Al-Adil governed Egypt on behalf of his brother Saladin and mobilized that country's vast resources in support of his brother's campaigns in Syria and his war against the Crusaders (1175‚Äì1183). He was governor of Aleppo (1183‚Äì1186) but returned to administer Egypt during the Third Crusade (1186‚Äì1192); as governor of Saladin's northern provinces (1192‚Äì1193), he suppressed the revolt of 'Izz Al-Din of Mosul following Saladin's death (March 1193). On Saladin's death he was governor of Damascus. In 1190, King Richard I of England successively proposed to marry his younger sister Joan and his niece Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany to Al-Adil, but both were in vain, as Al-Adil showed no interest in Christianity.A Bit of History WebSiteThe Angevin Empire  Struggle for succession of Saladin  The key question in the ruling Ayyubid family following the death of Saladin was whether power would remain with Saladin's own sons, or be distributed more widely among its various branches, or, indeed, be concentrated in the hands of al-Adil himself. Saladin had required all the Amirs to swear loyalty to his son al-Afdal Ali, but after his death some of his other sons would not accept al-Afdal's overlordship.A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades by Steven Runciman, p.79 In the disputes which followed al-Adil often found himself in the position of honest broker between al-Afdal Ali and his brother al-Aziz Uthman, trying to keep the peace.A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades by Steven Runciman, p.79 Eventually however al-Adil concluded that al-Afdal Ali was simply unfit to rule, and he supported al-Aziz Uthman to become Sultan in his place, forcing his brother into exile.A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades by Steven Runciman, p.81 Al-Aziz Uthman's death in 1198 following a riding accident reopened the dynastic struggles once again. Al- Afdal Ali was invited back to Egypt to act as regent to al-Aziz Uthman's twelve-year-old successor, al-Mansur Mohammed. From this power base he joined forces with his brother az-Zahir Ghazi to try and drive al-Adil out of Damascus, which they besieged.A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades by Steven Runciman, p.81 Al-Adil, skilfully played his nephews off against each other, and suborned the vassals of both from their allegiance. The arrival of al-Khamil, al-Adil's son, at Damascus with reinforcements and continuing quarrels led to the ending of the siege in December 1199. Al-Afdal retreated to Egypt, but his uncle pursued him and defeated his army at Bilbeis. Fleeing to Cairo, al-Afdal sued for peace on any terms he could get from al-Adil; stripped of Egypt he was promised the cities of Samosata and Mayyafaraqin. On the 17th of February 1200 al-Adil proclaimed himself 'sultan'. Al-Afdal was refused control of Mayyafaraqin by another of al-Adil's sons, al-Auhad. Al-Afdal once again allied with az-Zahir and the two brothers once more besieged Damascus. However, dissension again broke out between them, with al-Afdal eventually losing the will to continue fighting. Al-Adil confirmed al-Afdal's rule over Samosata, Saruj and a number of other towns. Az-Zahir admitted his uncle's suzerainty in the Spring of 1202, and al- Adil had succeeded in exerting his authority over all the Ayyubid dominions.Humphreys, R. S. (1997) From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193‚Äì1260, SUNY Press, pp. 111‚Äì122  Rule  After his victory, he was proclaimed Sultan and ruled wisely and well over both Egypt and Syria for nearly two decades, promoting trade and good relations with the Crusader states (1200‚Äì1217). For much of his reign however the effective ruler of Egypt was his son Al-Kamil.The Cambridge History of Egypt, eds. M. W. Daly, Carl F. Petry, Volume 1, p.221 The reign of al Adil was generally more one of consolidation than of expansion. He was in his late fifties by the time he consolidated his power, and by that time had been almost constantly at war for two decades. His first concern was to rebuild his treasury, which had been left almost empty by his brother's empire-building, the wars with the Crusaders and the struggles within the Ayyubid dynasty itself. Al-Adil introduced reforms both to the currency and to the taxation system.The Cambridge History of Egypt, eds. M. W. Daly, Carl F. Petry, Volume 1, p.221 The effectiveness of his measures can be judged from the relatively rapid recovery Egypt made from an earthquake in 1200 (597) and the low flooding of the Nile between 1199 and 1202 (595‚Äì98). The resulting drought and famine were serious threats, but by a range of measures including sending his soldiers out to work the land, al-Adil ensured continued social and political stability as well as economic recovery.The Cambridge History of Egypt, eds. M. W. Daly, Carl F. Petry, Volume 1, p.221 Avoiding a new crusade was the second main concern of al-Adil's reign, and to this end he encouraged trade with European merchants, calculating that if the trading cities of the Mediterranean had a stake in peaceful trade they would be less inclined to support a new Crusade. He was not entirely successful in this, and there were Frankish naval raids on Rosetta in 1204 (600) and Damietta in 1211 (607).The Cambridge History of Egypt, eds. M. W. Daly, Carl F. Petry, Volume 1, p.221 His third concern was to maintain hegemony within the Ayyubid domains without resort to force. He proved to be a skilled diplomat in this respect and managed to avoid any confrontations after 1201. Of particular importance was the marriage of his daughter Dayfa Khatun to Saladin's son Az-Zahir Ghazi of Aleppo in 1212, which marked the end of the rivalry between the two branches of the family.From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193‚Äì1260 by R. Stephen Humphreys p.155 Al-Adil also undertook a major programme of refortification throughout his domains, and the massive citadel of Damascus was one of his most notable achievements in this respect.The New Cambridge Medieval History: pts. 1‚Äì2. c. 1024-c. 1198 eds. Rosamond McKitterick, David Edward Luscombe, David Abulafia p.748 Al-Adil's territorial ambitions were focused far away from the main centres of Ayyubid rule, in southern Anatolia and northern Iraq. He succeeded over time in bringing much of the old Zengid dominions, apart from Mosul and Sinjar, under his control, as well as the region around Lake Van.The New Cambridge Medieval History: pts. 1‚Äì2. c. 1024-c. 1198 eds. Rosamond McKitterick, David Edward Luscombe, David Abulafia p.748 He took Ahlat in 1207 and brought to an end the rule of the Ahlatshahs.  Death and legacy  One of the main objects of al-Adil's foreign policy was to avoid provoking the launching of a new Crusade. However, in September 1217 (Jumada II 612) a new crusader army disembarked at Acre. Al-Adil was totally unprepared for this assault and despite being seventy-two years of age he hurriedly took his forces into Palestine to engage with them. The campaigns in Palestine did not bring him any notable success however, and in August 1218 (Jumada 1 615) he received the shocking news that a second Crusader force had landed in Egypt and were attacking Damietta.From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193‚Äì1260 by R. Stephen Humphreys, p. 160 He fell ill and died while on campaign (August 1218) and was succeeded by his son Malik Al-Kamil. Al Adil's rule was decisive in determining the shape of the Ayyubid realm for many years to come. After him, the succession in Egypt and to the coveted title of Sultan remained in the eldest male line of his successors. His descendants also controlled the critical border fortress of Mayyafariqin in the far northeast of the Ayyubid realm. Elsewhere, Saladin's descendants retained Aleppo, and the family of Al-Adil's other brother Nur ad-Din Shahanshah held Baalbek and Hama. Homs was held by the descendants of Al- Adil's uncle Shirkuh. Damascus became the main focus of rivalry between different branches of the family, changing hands a number of times before Ayyubid rule came to an end.Lane-Poole, Stanley,The Mohammedan Dynasties, COnstable, London 1894 p.77  See also  *List of rulers of Egypt *Thirty Years' Truce  References  * Category:Ayyubid sultans of Egypt Category:1145 births Category:1218 deaths Category:Muslims of the Crusade of 1197 Category:Muslims of the Fifth Crusade Category:Ayyubid emirs of Damascus Category:13th-century Egyptian people ","title":"Al-Adil I"},{"id":"1492316","text":"Cornelia Rau is a German and Australian citizen who was unlawfully detained for a period of ten months in 2004 and 2005 as part of the Australian Government's mandatory detention program. Her detention became the subject of a government inquiry which was later expanded to investigate over 200 other cases of suspected unlawful detention by the Australian government's Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). She disappeared from Manly Hospital on 17 March 2004, and, in February 2005, it was revealed that she had been unlawfully detained at Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre, a prison, and later at Baxter Detention Centre, after being classified as a suspected illegal immigrant or non-citizen by the Immigration Department when she refused to reveal her true identity.Sunday 2005. Life in Australia Rau arrived in Australia from Germany in 1967, aged eighteen months. Her family lived in Australia until 1980 when they returned to Germany. They lived there for two years, then moved to Asia and once again to Australia in 1983 where they remained. Although Rau is still a German citizen and spoke some German at home, at school and elsewhere she spoke English.Palmer 2005, p. 1. Rau attended an art school and worked in hospitality before taking a job as a flight attendant with Qantas. In April 1998, Rau joined Kenja Communication, a cult, but was apparently expelled from the organisation following a Kenja event in Melbourne. Mental illness In October 1998, Rau was hospitalised for three months, after unstable behaviour probably brought on by a Kenja artistic festival. September 2005 edition At the time, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but doctors later diagnosed her with schizophrenia. At one point, doctors believed that Rau had schizoaffective bipolar disorder. Between January 1999 and March 2004, Rau was hospitalised several more times after further incidents of unstable behaviour. On several occasions, she disappeared for a few days, and sometimes she travelled overseas, but she had always returned or made contact with her family, usually with her sister, Christine Rau. On 1 December 2003, Rau disappeared, and was reported missing to the police by her family, but she soon returned.Palmer 2005, p. 9. Rau was prescribed medication for her condition and was often re-admitted to hospital, but did not like the treatment because of its side effects. Eventually Rau's doctors and her family scheduled a community treatment order hearing for 18 March 2004, which would have compelled Rau to take her medication. Disappearance On 17 March 2004, Rau discharged herself from Manly Hospital and disappeared. The following day, Manly Hospital reported Rau to the New South Wales Police as a \\"missing patient\\", although they did not consider her to be in any serious danger.Palmer 2005, p. 2. On 29 March 2004 Rau arrived at the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and travelling alone. Since it was the wet season, and she did not have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no one else in Australia who would know she was missing. On 31 March, Queensland Police contacted the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) and gave it the details that Rau had provided. DIMIA said that it had no records of the arrival of any person called Anna Brotmeyer. The police returned to the Exchange Hotel, but Rau had left, and they later found her about fifteen kilometres north of the town, where they ordered her back to the Coen police station. There she gave several different stories about how and when she entered the country, none of them consistent. The police again contacted DIMIA, which advised them to detain Rau as a suspected unlawful non-citizen under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Palmer 2005, p. 10. Rau was searched, and had a Norwegian passport, a book with two names (both different from Anna and Cornelia) on it, and A$2,413 in her possession.Palmer 2005, p. 10. Later that day she was driven from Coen to Cairns. Detention=Queensland On 2 April, Rau was visited by Iris Indorato, the honorary consul for Germany and France in Cairns. Rau communicated with her in German, because officials did not know at the time that Rau could speak English, and it was presumed that she was a lost German citizen.Palmer 2005, p. 11. Indorato said that her command of the language was fluent but \\"child-like\\" in terms of vocabulary, and that Rau could not remember basic information such as her parents' names, and where she had been born. On 5 April, Rau was transferred to Brisbane, and to the Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre (BWCC), where she would remain for the next six months. There she was placed among the general prison population, because there are no immigration detention facilities in Queensland. Rau was technically in the custody of DIMIA, although she was in reality being cared for by BWCC and Queensland Corrective Services. While in prison, Rau was met by Debbie Kilroy, who ran an organisation called Sisters Inside, to support women in prison. Kilroy first met her in early May, when Rau had been without medication for two months. Rau identified herself to Kilroy as Anna, but spoke to her in fluent English with an Australian accent. On several occasions, Rau asked Kilroy to contact DIMIA for her, to ask when she would be released from prison, since she \\"had done nothing wrong\\" Other prisoners stated to the media that Anna would try to phone DIMIA but was unable to, because she could not remember who she was. DIMIA's position was that it was Rau's responsibility to identify herself, not theirs. On 29 April, a DIMIA officer contacted the Missing Persons Unit of the Queensland Police, and sent them the information they had collected about Anna. The Unit said that they had no records matching the descriptions provided.Palmer 2005, p. 12. On 11 May, Rau asked if she could apply for a German passport, and DIMIA officials prepared a form filled in with her details, giving her name as Anna Schmidt. Four days later, the German Consulate in Sydney rejected the passport application, because it contained insufficient or inadequate information. On 17 June, DIMIA contacted the Australian Embassy in Berlin for assistance in identifying Rau. Throughout June 2004, as Rau's condition deteriorated, other prisoners began to suspect that she was ill, because she would pace all day and would slam doors. Kilroy said that she attempted to raise the matter with BWCC officials, but they said that it was a DIMIA responsibility. On 5 July, Anna was one of 25 prisoners interviewed by an Ethical Standards Unit from the Government of Queensland, which was investigating claims of abuse within the prison system. During the taped interview, Anna recalled an incident in which she was sent to solitary confinement in the Detention Unit, or DU, for attempting to obtain a newspaper from another room in the prison. During Rau's six months in BWCC, she spent five weeks in solitary confinement in the DU. On 30 July, after several BWCC inmates and staff expressed concerns about Anna's welfare, the prison's psychologist recommended that she have a psychiatric evaluation, so that her mental health could be assessed. One week later, on 6 August, a BWCC officer also asked for an evaluation, to determine whether Anna could be placed in the community, rather than remain in the prison. Eventually, on 10 August, the prison psychiatrist recommended that she be taken to a hospital for a full assessment, to determine her mental health. Her report noted that Anna's behaviour was unusual, and she had poor hygiene and would behave inappropriately towards the guards, particularly the male ones. Anna was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane on 20 August, where doctors spent six days assessing her. She was returned to BWCC on 26 August, after doctors failed to diagnose her schizophrenia.Palmer 2005, p. 13-14. Meanwhile, on 11 August, Rau's family officially reported her as a missing person to the New South Wales Police. The police launched a public appeal, advertising in newspapers and placing posters nearby. On 12 August, NSW police contacted DIMIA, to search their records for information about Rau. The search revealed nothing, and there was no further interstate cooperation. The police contacted DIMIA again six weeks later, on 24 September, in an attempt to discover whether Rau had left or tried to leave Australia. DIMIA replied that she had not left, and was still in the country.Palmer 2005, p. 14. By the end of September 2004, DIMIA officials were planning to move Rau to the Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (commonly known as the Baxter Detention Centre), a DIMIA facility (operated by Global Solutions Limited, or GSL) near the town of Port Augusta in South Australia. Rau refused to sign the transfer forms, but, on 6 October, she was transferred to Baxter anyway. She had to be sedated and placed in restraints in order to get her on the plane.Palmer 2005, p. 15. Baxter Rau arrived at Baxter later that day and was referred to a psychologist there. The psychologist assessed Rau on 7 October, but was unable to diagnose schizophrenia, declaring instead that she had behavioural problems. After she would not communicate with DIMIA officials at her induction interview on 8 October, she was again referred to the psychologist, who assessed her again on 12 October. On 14 October, the psychologist reported that medication would be useless, and that Anna should be transferred to a facility such as the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney, which had a female-only area which would be more suitable for Anna. DIMIA did not think this was appropriate, however, and did not transfer Anna, in spite of the fact that the BWCC psychiatrist had noted her inappropriate behaviour around men. Instead, Rau was sent to the Management Unit, known simply as Management, which the Baxter psychologist had specifically warned was not a suitable long-term solution. Management consisted of solitary-confinement cells, with both the bed and the toilet visible to Baxter staff through the windows. Rau was entitled to four hours each day outside her cell (although not in the company of other detainees), and, whenever she had to be returned to her cell, GSL officers wearing riot gear would forcibly put her into the cell, according to Sister Claudette Cusack. On 3 November, Rau refused to talk to the psychologist and, on 6 November, was scheduled for an assessment by a psychiatrist, Dr. Andrew Fruckacz, who recommended that she be taken to a hospital. He could not make a certain diagnosis, but he believed that schizophrenia was a possibility, along with a personality disorder. A psychiatrist from Glenside Mental Health Service, a campus of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, was told about Anna's behaviour, and said that her problems were behavioural, and not mental-health related. The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) offered a videoconference, but Baxter officials instead wanted Anna to be admitted to a hospital, because they believed that she would not cooperate with a video assessment. On 17 November, the RRMHS took Anna off the waiting list for hospital treatment, without informing officials at Baxter, who believed that their request was still being considered.Palmer 2005, p. 16. Despite Dr. Fruckacz's recommendations, Rau was put into Management for a second time. Later, she was moved to the Red 1 compound, specially built to prevent riots and to hold rowdy detainees. There they are separated from the general population, isolated and held indoors for eighteen hours a day. At a Management Unit meeting on 24 November, Anna's case manager said that she thought that Anna was not German at all but an Australian with German parents. Other staff at Baxter, as well as DIMIA staff in Canberra, were informed of this opinion. Previously, on 12 November, the German Consulate in Melbourne had decided to try to identify Anna. They contacted an officer of the Victoria Police, who, in turn, contacted the DIMIA headquarters in Canberra. DIMIA contacted the consulate on 6 December, but neither had made any progress. Meanwhile, on 22 December, police in Manly, New South Wales contacted DIMIA, without providing photographs or other information, to see if Rau had used her Australian passport to leave the country. In late December, a group of Christian ministers, including Sister Claudette Cusack, who worked at Baxter, wrote to DIMIA about Anna and other detainees who appeared to have mental- health issues. Father Arno Vermeeren, who also works at Baxter, raised his concerns about Anna and the Red 1 compound with the Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG), shortly before a scheduled inspection. None of these concerns were addressed. On 5 January 2005, the German Consulate in Melbourne told DIMIA that without information such as fingerprints, they would not be able to identify Anna and, on 14 January, said that officials in Germany had also made no progress. Rau herself contacted the consulate on 20 January, still identifying herself as Anna Schmidt, but staff told her that they still required more information. Consular staff later told Anna's case manager at Baxter that Anna's \\"child-like\\" command of the German language was consistent with Anna being an Australian of German background, corroborating the case manager's suspicion from the 24 November, meeting.Palmer 2005, p. 16-17. It was noted in the Palmer Inquiry that, at times, Anna would speak English with an Australian accent and, at other times, with a German accent, alongside also speaking German. Meanwhile, on 4 January, psychologists at Baxter contacted RRMHS again, and Glenside officials finally investigated the information sent to them in November 2004. On 7 January, a doctor from International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), a DIMIA sub-contractor, examined Anna again and suggested that she might have schizophrenia, or at least a schizophrenia- related condition. On 24 January, DIMIA officials in Canberra discussed with Glenside doctors the possibility of committing Anna. The IHMS doctor again tried to assess Anna on 31 January, but he could not get her to cooperate, and, on 2 February, the doctor contacted a psychiatrist at Glenside, who said that Anna should be assessed under the South Australian Mental Health Act 1993 for possible committal. The doctor assessed Anna on the next day and, after consulting with the Glenside doctor, committed Anna.Palmer 2005, p. 18-19. Discovery On 31 January 2005, The Age newspaper in Melbourne published a story by Andra Jackson, entitled \\"Mystery woman at Baxter may be ill\\". The story was seen by friends of the Rau family, who thought that the woman the article referred to could be Cornelia Rau, so they contacted the family. The family, in turn, contacted the New South Wales Police, who emailed DIMIA officials at Baxter with details and photographs of Rau. Soon, DIMIA staff officially identified Anna as Cornelia Rau. Later that night, South Australia Police officers entered Baxter and removed Rau. She was transported to the nearby Port Augusta Hospital and, on the morning of 4 February, committed to the Glenside Hospital mental health facility.Palmer 2005, p. 20. Inquiry On 9 February 2005, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Hon. Amanda Vanstone, announced that former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer would be conducting an inquiry into the circumstances around the detention of Rau. This would become known as the Palmer Inquiry. On 2 May, the terms of reference were expanded to allow Palmer to investigate the wrongful deportation of Vivian Solon to the Philippines in 2001. The report of the Palmer Inquiry was released on 14 July 2005. Senator Vanstone tabled the report in Parliament and held a press conference along with Prime Minister John Howard, in which they apologised to Rau and Solon. Labor Immigration spokesperson Tony Burke criticised the Inquiry, saying that only a Royal Commission would have the necessary powers to investigate the situation properly. Cornelia Rau herself said that she wanted Senator Vanstone to be replaced as Immigration Minister by someone from an ethnic background. In July 2005, and again later in the year, the government promised that Rau would be compensated. In February 2008, lawyers for Rau accepted an increased offer of compensation on her behalf later confirmed at A$2.6 million.; Current life In May 2008, Rau was cleared to travel by a psychiatrist in Adelaide, but was subsequently \\"held in isolation at a Hamburg hospital\\" in a closed ward for 7 weeks until late October 2008. She had been living in Adelaide under the guardianship of the Public Advocate. Her family expressed disbelief that she was allowed overseas travel while also on an authorised \\"three- to six-month break from her medication\\". Rau was arrested while behaving erratically in the city of Tafila, Jordan in February 2009. Local officials say she was taken into custody for failing to pay hotel and taxi bills. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs says Australian authorities will continue to provide aid to Rau. She returned to Australia on 22 March 2009, accompanied by two medics, her lawyer and Australian Federal Police. She arrived in Sydney then flew to Adelaide where she was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with her nurse and guardian.

A Tonga, Australia and New South Wales State of Origin representative winger, he played in the NRL for Sydney clubs, the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles (with whom he won the 1996 Premiership), Wests Tigers and the Northern Eagles. Hopoate also became the Australian Heavyweight Boxing Champion. He was born in Tonga, but moved to Australia with his family while he was still young and took up the game of rugby league. Hopoate began his professional league career with Manly-Warringah while he was nineteen years of age, and was also selected for the Tonga national team. Hopoate did not play as a regular first-grade player until two years later in 1995 where he showed his ability by scoring 21 tries, finishing second in the top try-scoring table to teammate Steve Menzies. After many controversies his reputation became greatly tarnished and his career continued on a downhill slide, seeing him become the \\"most suspended player of the modern era\\". In 2018 he was given a 10-year ban from any involvement in rugby league. Hopoate was also a professional boxer. He is the father of Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs player Will Hopoate. Childhood and early career Born in Nukualofa, Tonga on 16 January 1974, Hopoate moved with his family to Australia and he originally lived and grew up in the Manly area of Sydney before moving to the western suburbs as a teenager. Former Australian international Bob Fulton recruited Hopoate to his former club at Manly after remembering his skill and power while witnessing him play as a junior for his Manly Cove side before then going on to represent the under nineteen New South Wales side. Hopoate is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (1993‚Äì99) Hopoate signed for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles club in 1993 making his first grade debut against the Canberra Raiders at Brookvale Oval 6 June the same year. He played for Tonga in the 1994 Pacific Cup, however he was in and out of the first grade side on a regular basis, not holding down a regular position until 1995. Hopoate's early season form in 1995 was sublime as he went on to score eleven tries from his first eleven first grade appearances and subsequently lead the try scoring table. After his spectacular form and try scoring feats during the 1995 season Hopoate was called up to his first senior representative match for New South Wales in game one of the 1995 State of Origin series. After a decent performance from Hopoate he was retained for the second game but then subsequently dropped from the third game because of an injury. Over the remaining rounds of the 1995 ARL season Hopoate went on to score a total of twenty-one tries and became instrumental in Manly's good form leading into the finals series. His talent was not enough to help the Manly side to a grand final victory as they eventually lost to the Bulldogs. With Tonga looking to pick Hopoate for his nation of birth for the 1995 World Cup, Australia took no chances and instead called him up to the Kangaroos side under the residency ruling. He was selected in the opening match of the cup yet failed to score and then made a vital mistake that turned out to be the turning point in a match that was eventually won by Australia's opponents England. Hopoate also played in Australia's following match against the South Africans, scoring three times in a crushing 86 to 6 victory. Hopoate's fourth season at Manly was one where he was again instrumental in his team's fortunes, while he began the season slowly in comparison to his previous year with only five tries over the first twenty rounds of the season his defence had improved immensely; helping his side to concede less tries down his side of the field. He went on to score another six tries for the season including four in one game against the South Sydney Rabbitohs and ultimately help his Manly side to their first premiership in over eight years. In the 1997 season Hopoate again started the season off slowly on the try scoring front with only another two tries in twelve appearances for the club before turning his fortunes around in round twelve match against the St. George Dragons where he scored three tries before continuing his form from then on scoring eight in his next six games and a total of fifteen for the season. Wests Tigers (2000‚Äì01) Signing for the newly formed Wests Tigers in 2000 Hopoate scored five tries during the season. He was suspended several times during the season, including being charged with 'contrary conduct' in a late season fixture against Melbourne resulting from over ten separate incidents in that game. In 2001 he began the season poorly scoring only one try in several appearances before causing international headlines after a regular season game against the North Queensland Cowboys where Hopoate had been inserting his fingers into the backsides of several players, allegedly in an attempt to unsettle and upset his opposition. After a long NRL Judiciary case Hopoate was suspended for twelve weeks and then mutually agreed to part ways with the Tigers club. On-field sexual assaults During a 2001 clash with the North Queensland Cowboys, Hopoate tried to unsettle his opponents by inserting a finger in three players' anuses, the first occurring during the seventh minute of play. The matter was immediately referred to the rugby league judiciary on 28 March. Hopoate was suspended for 12 weeks for what one Commissioner described as \\"disgusting, violent, offensive behaviour\\". Hopoate claimed in front of the panel of judges that he was just trying to give all three players a wedgie with his fingers, denying he had done anything wrong and that he was \\"a great believer in what happens on the field should stay there\\". The three victims in the case, Cowboys players Glenn Morrison, Peter Jones and Paul Bowman all disagreed with Hopoate's reasoning. According to Jones, \\"It wasn't a wedgie. That's when your pants are pulled up your arse. I think I know the difference between a wedgie and someone sticking their finger up my bum\\", while Bowman said he was \\"disgusted\\" and \\"couldn't believe it\\". Hopoate was found guilty of 'unsportsmanlike interference'. Northern Eagles (2001‚Äì02) As he had publicly humiliated both himself and his former club, most thought his career would be over. However, his former employers in the Manly reserve grade side signed him onto their books for the remainder of the season where his good form earned him a call-up to the Northern Eagles first grade side late in the season. Hopoate ran 3,976 metres with the ball over the 2002 NRL season, more than any other player in the competition. The following year his form finally began to pick up as he went on to score ten tries for the Eagles before the club disbanded in 2003. Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (2003‚Äì05) With the reinstating of the Sea Eagles for the beginning of the 2003 season Hopoate was signed on to the club where he originally made his debut for ten years earlier. He began the season well with several impressive performances but again his on field indiscretions were the only headlines he was achieving. The following two seasons were poor for Hopoate with several on field and off field incidents earning him both fines and suspensions. His final foul-up occurred during a match in the 2005 season against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Hopoate attempted a reckless \\"shoulder charge\\" making contact to the head of forward Keith Galloway with his elbow. This was seen as the last straw for Hopoate by both his Manly club and the National Rugby League and his career was effectively over. He made a final statement on the Sea Eagles website thanking his fans and supporters and apologising to his wife Brenda and eight children. Controversy In the 2003 season Hopoate breached the terms of his playing contract by playing in a fifth-grade rugby union match in the Sydney competition on 9 June under a false name in an attempt to not get caught. After his Manly club found out and confronted Hopoate he admitted that he had breached his contract and was then fined $5000. During the 2004 club season, Hopoate become involved in more controversy. While leaving the field at the conclusion of a match Hopoate started a heated argument with a touch judge in which he verbally abused the official. Hopoate was given a lengthy suspension by the NRL. In the round one clash with the New Zealand Warriors, Hopoate verbally abused a 14-year-old rugby league ball boy who had placed the ball on the sideline of the field rather than throwing it infield to the Manly player. The incident was placed under review with the National Rugby League finding that ball boy had acted in the guidelines set out and Hopoate was in the wrong over his verbal assault. Hopoate then apologised to the young boy claiming that \\"he was not aware of the proper interpretation of the rule\\" and was in the wrong. =Keith Galloway incident= On 19 March 2005, Hopoate was again in trouble with the NRL, this time in a match against the Cronulla- Sutherland Sharks. During the 30th minute of the game he made a charge at Cronulla forward Keith Galloway with his elbow in a cocked position jumping and striking Galloway in the head immediately knocking him unconscious, leaving him on the field with a laceration to and bleeding from his ear. After immediate review from the third official Hopoate was sent from the field for the remainder of the match while Galloway was stretchered from the field in a neck brace and took no further part in the game. At the conclusion of the match, the NRL match review committee immediately referred Hopoate's case straight to the NRL Judiciary. On 22 March, Hopoate had his case called up to the judiciary, his lawyer and coach attempted to argue that he was doing nothing more than \\"trying to go for a shoulder charge\\" and that his raised arm was just an attempt to protect his ribs. His contrition carried little weight with the panel and ultimately his defence failed to convince anyone that he had done nothing wrong and he was given a seventeen-game suspension. With his season over, his loyal club that had stood by him through many of his career indiscretions decided they had no other choice than to terminate his contract with immediate effect on 23 March 2005. On 9 December 2005, Hopoate was banned from rugby league for 12 months after threatening a junior official at a local match. Boxing career With the termination of his Sea Eagles contract effectively bringing to an end his days of playing rugby league, Hopoate announced that he would begin training in an attempt to undertake a career in professional boxing. On 17 May 2006 he fought in his first professional boxing bout, on the undercard of the Anthony Mundine and Danny Green fight. Hopoate won his debut after only 47 seconds of the opening round, knocking out Frank \\"The Big Ship\\" Faasolo. After the quick victory, Hopoate challenged former professional rugby league footballer Mark Geyer to a fight, citing his reasons as being \\"I know he hates being bagged, but for him to go sit behind a magazine and bag other players, I don't like that\\". Geyer turned down the challenge on the NRL Footy Show the following week. Instead, he followed-up against New Zealand fighter Alex Mene on 4 August, whom he defeated with a somewhat controversial fourth round technical knockout after the referee called a halt to the bout. Hopoate's third fight was against Ipswich Brothers rugby league prop forward Anthony Fowler. The pair had previously fought during an under-17 representative match 15 years earlier, but Fowler found little opportunity to trade blows with Hopoate as he was left motionless on the canvas after just 34 seconds of his only professional boxing appearance. Subsequently, he defeated two more heavyweights from New Zealand during bouts in Queensland. Hopoate first put a finish to one-sided event against Oscar Talemaira with a first-round technical knockout on 17 November. He then knocked out Hiriwa Te Rangi on 24 February 2007 after a stiffer contest that lasted five rounds, his longest fight to date. Hopoate then moved to a 6‚Äì0 record by dispatching the heavy-hitting Richard \\"Tootin'\\" Tutaki with a series of second round body-blows on 7 March 2007 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, again on an Anthony Mundine undercard. Lovemore N'dou, the IBF junior welterweight champion, said after watching the bout that Hopoate is an embarrassment to the sport of boxing, and that he was disgusted with what he saw. As part of his scathing criticism of Hopoate, as well as Willie Mason's older brother Les, N'dou said: \\"Footballers like them thinking they can box turns what is a scientific and artistic sport into a circus. They are making fools out of themselves and fools out of a sport I love. I despise them and everything they stand for\\". On 30 March 2007, Hopoate experienced his first defeat, which came by Brian Fitzgerald. The result, a split decision after six rounds, proved controversial and inspired Hopoate to say, \\"I'm being vilified again. It obviously has something to do with my playing days. I know I'm going to be 'John Hopoate' for the rest of my life. But I've tried to take a new road and I thought I was going along good, until this. They are racist cause I'm from Tonga, it's not bloody right. I never get a fair go from Aussies\\". On 13 April 2007, Hopoate suffered his second straight loss, inflicted by former national kickboxing champion, Ben Edwards, who was making his professional boxing debut. Hopoate's performance, which was brought to an abrupt end by technical knockout after just 90 seconds of the first round, was jeered and ridiculed by the 200-odd paying spectators, several of whom were seen to throw plastic beer cups in the direction of Hopoate. With three further bouts scheduled before July, he aimed to continue his career. However, following his earlier criticism, Lovemore N'dou has commented that Hopoate needs to \\"learn to fight properly\\", as well as the more inflammatory \\"Hoppa should stop putting his finger up other guys anuses \\"; however, has now offered to help him out at no charge. On 10 September 2008, Hopoate became Australian heavyweight boxing champion. The Sydney fighter finished defending champion Bob Mirovic deep into the ninth round of an epic bout at the Gold Coast convention centre. Hopoate cornered \\"The Big Bear\\" Mirovic and hit him with more than six clean punches to knock the 42-year-old to the floor. Mirovic got to his feet but his trainer Jeff Fenech threw in the towel to end the fight. After the title fight, controversy ensued, Mirovic claiming that Hopoate used illegal tactics during the bout which resulted in Mirovic having his arm broken. Mirovic believes he was illegally shoved to the ground in the sixth round, which left him with a broken arm and no hope of carrying on.\\"I couldn't throw a punch for the final three rounds because of what Hoppa did,\\" Mirovic said. \\"I'd cop it on the chin if I lost the fight fair and square, but there's no way I'll sit back if something illegal was done to me. It was a dog act by Hoppa. I can't do anything now for three months and I'm demanding Hoppa doesn't fight anybody else until he gives me a rematch.\\" He fought Cliff Couser on 20 March 2009 and won the fight by technical knockout after Couser did not answer the bell for the fourth round. Hopoate fought Oliver McCall on 22 May 2009 for the International Boxing Association (IBA) Intercontinental heavyweight title in a fight which he lost by second-round technical knockout after being knocked down twice in the fight. He fought Bob Mirovic again on 23 July 2009, beating him on points after a gruelling 10-round match. Hopoate fought Colin Wilson on 10 October 2009, on the undercard of the David Tua and Shane Cameron fight. Hopoate started the fight well scoring a knock down in the third round, before Colin Wilson came back from the knock down to knock Hopoate down late in the same round. Wilson went on to win the fight knocking Hopoate out in the fourth round. Hopoate then fought Shane Cameron on 20 March 2010, losing the fight by disqualification in the second round after Hopoate wrestled with Cameron and tried throwing him to the ground more than he tried throwing punches. On 20 December 2018, Hopoate agreed to return to the ring to fight Cronulla player Paul Gallen with the match being scheduled for 9 February 2019. Hopoate was knocked out in the second round of the bout. He said afterwards ‚ÄúI got caught by a good punch and I can‚Äôt hide from that, I went to sleep and fell over\\". Criminal charges In December 2010 Hopoate was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray following an incident at the Trademark Hotel in Kings Cross where he worked. Hopoate was employed as a Responsible Service of Alcohol marshall and not for security. In August 2013 Hopoate pleaded guilty to intimidating a parking officer outside the Trademark Hotel in June 2013. He was fined $400 over the incident. In May 2016 Hopoate was arrested and charged with common assault after an incident involving an employee of a Crows Nest supermarket. Hopoate subsequently pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to a $1500 fine and an 18-month good behaviour bond. Post playing career In 2016, Hopoate started coaching Manly's S. G. Ball Cup side until The NRL claimed the former international was not of fit and proper character to mentor young and impressionable men, threatening the Sea Eagles with a breach notice if they didn't stand Hopoate down. The NRL then released a statement saying ‚ÄúHe is not registered to coach. Mr Hopoate has taken the matter to the Supreme Court. The NRL is contesting his case and has not changed its stance at all\\". In a bizarre social media post, Hopoate wrote \\"I'm back, NRL asked if we can withdraw the court proceedings cause they don't have juristriction over SG Ball, so I can coach this week Cheeho! Following up with the hashtag: ‚Äú#NoHardFeelingsTimeToMoveOnAndLetThePastBeThePast#‚Äù. But the NRL quickly denied it had cleared Hopoate to coach, tweeting from its NRL Media account: ‚ÄúThe NRL has NOT cleared John Hopoate to coach Manly‚Äôs SG Ball side\\". On 30 July 2016, Hopoate was forced to pay legal costs after he dropped his court case against The NRL. The NRL threatened to fine Manly $1 Million dollars and Hopoate $100,000 dollars if he continued coaching the court heard. In October 2017, Hopoate joined The Tongan camp for The 2017 rugby league world cup. In the build up to the tournament New Zealand player Adam Blair commented on Jason Taumalolo's defection to Tonga saying \\"You've got to be a man and own up to what you want to do, If you were man enough, you'd make the phone call and tell them\\". On 12 October, Hopoate responded to Blair's comments saying \\"Who the hell is Adam Blair to come and say that?, They don't say anything when we name him in our team and that they were meant to turn up for a camp ‚Äì they name him and take him out of our team, So what are they complaining about? He wants to come play for his heritage and who the hell is Adam Blair?.I'll bash Adam Blair I don't care. On 24 July 2018, Hopoate was charged by the NSWRL for punching opposition players while playing for the Narraweena Hawks against Forestville in a local A Grade match. It was alleged that Hopoate also threatened players of the Forestville Ferrets side. He was subsequently banned from all involvement in rugby league for 10 years. On 17 November 2018, Hopoate played for Manly in the Legends of League charity event. He was allowed to participate because the event was not sanctioned by the NSWRL. Hopoate courted controversy as he wore a rubber glove on one hand during a match against Newcastle, referencing his 12 week suspension in 2001 for sticking his finger into the anus of opposition players. The media branded the prank \\"grubby\\" and \\"repulsive\\".

In the context of the Age of Discovery, the Dutch East India Company established its presence on Formosa to trade with the Ming Empire in China and Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, and also to interdict Portuguese and Spanish trade and colonial activities in East Asia. The time of Dutch rule saw economic development in Taiwan, including both large-scale hunting of deer and the cultivation of rice and sugar by imported Han labour from the Ming Empire. The Dutch also attempted to convert the aboriginal inhabitants to Christianity, and suppress aspects of traditional culture that they found disagreeable, such as head hunting, forced abortion and public nakedness. The Dutch were not universally welcomed, and uprisings by both aborigines and recent Han arrivals were quelled by the Dutch military on more than one occasion. With the rise of the Qing dynasty in the early 17th century, Dutch East India Company cut ties with the Ming dynasty and allied with the Qing instead, in exchange for the right to unfettered access to their trade and shipping routes. The colonial period was brought to an end after the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia by the Koxinga's army who promptly dismantled the Dutch colony, expelled the Dutch and established the Ming loyalist, anti-Qing Kingdom of Tungning. History Replica of an East Indiaman of the Dutch East India Company/United East Indies Company (VOC). Fort Zeelandia, Anping District, Tainan City. Established in 1624, Tainan is the oldest urban area on the island of Taiwan. Fort Zeelandia in Dutch Formosa in the 17th-century. It was in the Dutch rule period of Taiwan that Dutch East India Company (VOC) began to encourage large- scale mainland Chinese immigration. Background Dutch map of the Pescadores from circa 1726. As late comers in sailing the seas of the world, the Netherlands and England came, at the beginning of the 17th century, inevitably in conflict with the forces of Spain and Portugal, which already had established trading posts and even colonies in the Americas, Africa and Asia, often resulting in open warfare in Europe and in their possessions in Asia. In ideological terms, the conflict was expressed in the Iberian powers being Catholic, while during the commercial development of England and the Netherlands, both had separated their religious institutions from Papal Rome. The Dutch first attempted to trade with China in 1601 but were rebuffed by the Chinese authorities, who were already engaged in trade with the Portuguese at Macau from 1535. In a 1604 expedition from Batavia (the central base of the Dutch in Asia), Admiral van Warwijk set out to attack Macau, but his force was waylaid by a typhoon, driving them to the Pescadores (Penghu), a group of islands west of Formosa (Taiwan). Once there, the admiral attempted to negotiate trade terms with the Chinese on the mainland, but was asked to pay an exorbitant fee for the privilege of an interview. Surrounded by a vastly superior Chinese fleet, he left without achieving any of his aims. The Dutch East India Company tried to use military force to make China open up a port in Fujian to trade and demanded that China expel the Portuguese, whom the Dutch were fighting in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War, from Macau. The Dutch raided Chinese shipping after 1618 and took junks hostage in an unsuccessful attempt to get China to meet their demands. In 1622, after another unsuccessful Dutch attack on Macau (trade post of Portugal from 1557), the fleet sailed to the Pescadores, this time intentionally, and proceeded to set up a base there at Makung. They built a fort with forced labour recruited from the local Chinese population. Their oversight was reportedly so severe and rations so short that 1,300 of the 1,500 Chinese enslaved died in the process of construction. The same year a ship named the Golden Lion (Dutch: Gouden Leeuw) was wrecked at Lamey just off the southwest coast of Formosa; the survivors were slaughtered by the native inhabitants. The following year, 1623, Dutch traders in search of an Asian base first arrived on the island, intending to use the island as a station for Dutch commerce with Japan and the coastal areas of China. The Dutch demanded that China open up ports in Fujian to Dutch trade. China refused, warning the Dutch that the Pescadores were Chinese territory. The Chinese Governor of Fujian (Fukien), Shang Zhouzuo (Shang Chou-tso), demanded that the Dutch withdraw from the Pescadores to Formosa, where the Chinese would permit them to engage in trade. This led to a war between the Dutch and China between 1622-1624 which ended with the Chinese being successful in making the Dutch abandon the Pescadores and withdraw to Formosa. The Dutch threatened that China would face Dutch raids on Chinese ports and shipping unless the Chinese allowed trading on the Pescadores and that China not trade with Manila but only with the Dutch in Batavia and Siam and Cambodia. However, the Dutch found out that, unlike tiny Southeast Asian Kingdoms, China could not be bullied or intimidated by them. After Shang ordered them to withdraw to Formosa on 19 September 1622, the Dutch raided Amoy on October and November. The Dutch intended to \\"induce the Chinese to trade by force or from fear.\\" by raiding Fujian and Chinese shipping from the Pescadores. Long artillery batteries were erected at Amoy in March 1622 by Colonel Li-kung-hwa as a defence against the Dutch. On the Dutch attempt in 1623 to force China to open up a port, five Dutch ships were sent to Liu-ao and the mission ended in failure for the Dutch, with a number of Dutch sailors taken prisoner and one of their ships lost. In response to the Dutch using captured Chinese for forced labor and strengthening their garrison in the Pescadores with five more ships in addition to the six already there, the new Governor of Fujian, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch√º-i), was permitted by China to begin preparations to attack the Dutch forces in July 1623. A Dutch raid was defeated by the Chinese at Amoy in October 1623, with the Chinese taking the Dutch commander Christian Francs prisoner and burning one of the four Dutch ships. Yu Zigao began an offensive in February 1624 with warships and troops against the Dutch in the Pescadores with the intent of expelling them. The Chinese offensive reached the Dutch fort on 30 July 1624, with 5,000 Chinese troops (or 10,000) and 40-50 warships under Yu and General Wang Mengxiong surrounding the fort commanded by Marten Sonck, and the Dutch were forced to sue for peace on August 3 and folded before the Chinese demands, withdrawing from the Pescadores to Formosa. The Dutch admitted that their attempt at military force to coerce China into trading with them had failed with their defeat in the Pescadores. At the Chinese victory celebrations over the \\"red-haired barbarians,\\" as the Dutch were called by the Chinese, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch√º-yi) paraded twelve Dutch soldiers who were captured before the Emperor in Beijing. The Dutch were astonished that their violence did not intimidate the Chinese and at the subsequent Chinese attack on their fort in the Pescadores, since they thought them as timid and a \\"faint-hearted troupe,\\" based on their experience with them in Southeast Asia. Early years (1624‚Äì1625) Taiwan's southwest was already home to a Han population numbering close to 15,000 before 1623 when the Dutch first came. On deciding to set up in Taiwan and in common with standard practice at the time, the Dutch built a defensive fort to act as a base of operations. This was built on the sandy peninsula of Tayouan (now part of mainland Taiwan, in current-day Anping District). This temporary fort was replaced four years later by the more substantial Fort Zeelandia. Growing control, pacification of the aborigines (1626‚Äì1636) The first order of business was to punish villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in allegiance with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Bakloan and Mattau, north of Saccam near Tayowan. The Mattau campaign was easier than expected, and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirosen (Chiayi) to Longkiau (Hengchun). While the pacification campaign continued in Formosa, at sea, relations with the Chinese were strained by the Dutch attempts to tax ships in the Taiwan Strait. War eventually broke out between the Ming and the Dutch, and the Chinese Admiral Zheng Zhilong defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633. Some Dutch missionaries were killed by aboriginals whom they had tried to convert: \\"The catechist, Daniel Hendrickx, whose name has been often mentioned, accompanied this expedition to the south, as his great knowledge of the Formosa language and his familiar intercourse with the natives, rendered his services very valuable. On reaching the island of Pangsuy, he ventured‚Äîperhaps with overweening confidence in himself‚Äî too far away from the others, and was suddenly surrounded by a great number of armed natives, who, after killing him, carried away in triumph his head, arms, legs, and other members, even his entrails, leaving the mutilated trunk behind.\\" Pax Hollandica and the ousting of the Spanish (1636‚Äì1642) Following the pacification campaigns of 1635‚Äì1636, more and more villages came to the Dutch to swear allegiance, sometimes out of fear of Dutch military action, and sometimes for the benefits which Dutch protection could bring (food and security). These villages stretched from Longkiau in the south (125 km from the Dutch base at Fort Zeelandia) to Favorlang in central Taiwan, 90 km to the north of Fort Zeelandia. The relative calm of this period has been called the Pax Hollandica (Dutch Peace) by some commentators (a reference to the Pax Romana). One area not under their control was the north of the island, which from 1626 had been under Spanish sway, with their two settlements at Tamsui and Keelung. The fortification at Keelung was abandoned because the Spanish lacked the resources to maintain it, but Fort Santo Domingo in Tamsui was seen as a major obstacle to Dutch ambitions on the island and the region in general. After failing to drive out the Spanish in 1641, the Dutch returned in 1642 with reinforcements of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors in ships, managing to dislodge the small Spanish-Filipino contingent from their fortress and drive them from the island. Following this victory, the Dutch set about bringing the northern villages under their banner in a similar way to the pacification campaign carried out in the previous decade in the south. Growing Han presence and the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion (1643‚Äì1659) The Dutch began to encourage large-scale Han immigration to the island, mainly from the south of Hokkien. Most of the immigrants were young single males who were discouraged from staying on the island often referred to by Han as \\"The Gate of Hell\\" for its reputation in taking the lives of sailors and explorers. After one uprising by Hanin 1640, the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 saw an organised insurrection against the Dutch, fuelled by anger over punitive taxes and corrupt officials. The Dutch again put down the revolt hard, with fully 25% of those participating in the rebellion being killed over a period of a couple of weeks. Aboriginal rebellions in other areas of Taiwan (1650s) Multiple Aboriginal villages rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression like when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died. After an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.Shepherd1993, p. 59. Siege of Zeelandia and the end of Dutch government on Formosa (1660‚Äì1662) Governor Coyett and Koxinga In 1661, a naval fleet of 200 ships, led by the Ming loyalist Koxinga, landed at with the intention of ousting the Dutch from Zeelandia and making the island a base for Ming loyalists. Following a nine- month siege, Koxinga captured Zeelandia. Koxinga then forced the local representatives of the Dutch East India Company to sign a peace treaty at Zeelandia on 1 February 1662, and leave the island. From then on, the island became Koxinga's base for the Kingdom of Tungning. Coda: The Dutch retake Keelung (1664‚Äì1668) and further hostilies After being ousted from Taiwan, the Dutch allied with the new Qing dynasty in China against the Zheng regime in Taiwan. Following some skirmishes the Dutch retook the northern fortress at Keelung in 1664. Zheng Jing sent troops to dislodge the Dutch, but they were unsuccessful. The Dutch held out at Keelung until 1668, when aborigine resistance (likely incited by Zheng Jing),Shepherd 1993, p. 95. and the lack of progress in retaking any other parts of the island persuaded the colonial authorities to abandon this final stronghold and withdraw from Taiwan altogether. Zheng Jing's navy defeated a combined Qing-Dutch fleet commanded by Han Banner General Ma Degong in 1664 and Ma Degong was killed in the battle by Zheng's fleet. The Dutch looted relics and killed monks after attacking a Buddhist complex at Putuoshan on the Zhoushan islands in 1665 during their war against Zheng Chenggong's son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing's navy executed thirty four Dutch sailors and drowned eight Dutch sailors after looting, ambushing and sinking the Dutch fluyt ship Cuylenburg in 1672 on northeastern Taiwan. Only twenty one Dutch sailors escaped to Japan. The ship was going from Nagasaki to Batavia on a trade mission. Government The Prinsenvlag displayed by subject villages. The Dutch claimed the entirety of the island, but because of the inaccessibility of the central mountain range the extent of their control was limited to the plains on the west coast, plus isolated pockets on the east coast. This territory was acquired from 1624 to 1642, with most of the villages being required to swear allegiance to the Dutch and then largely being left to govern themselves. The manner of acknowledging Dutch lordship was to bring a small native plant (often betel nut or coconut) planted in earth from that particular town to the Governor, signifying the granting of the land to the Dutch. The Governor would then award the village leader a robe and a staff as symbols of office and a Prinsenvlag (\\"Prince's Flag\\", the flag of William the Silent) to display in their village. Governor of Formosa The Governor of Formosa (; ) was the head of government. Appointed by the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta, Indonesia), the Governor of Formosa was empowered to legislate, collect taxes, wage war and declare peace on behalf of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and therefore by extension the Dutch state. He was assisted in his duties by the Council of Tayouan, a group made up of the various worthies in residence in Tayouan. The President of this council was the second-in-command to the Governor, and would take over his duties if the Governor died or was incapacitated. The Governor's residence was in Fort Zeelandia on Tayouan (then an island, now the Anping District of Tainan City). There were a total of twelve Governors during the Dutch colonial era. Economy The Tayouan factory (as VOC trading posts were called) was to become the second-most profitable factory in the whole of the Dutch East Indies (after the post at Hirado/Dejima), although it took 22 years for the colony to first return a profit. Benefitting from triangular trade between themselves, the Chinese and the Japanese, plus exploiting the natural resources of Formosa, the Dutch were able to turn the malarial sub-tropical bay into a lucrative asset. A cash economy was introduced (using the Spanish real, which was used by the VOC) and the period also saw the first serious attempts in the island's history to develop it economically. Trade Formosan Sika Deer The original intention of setting up Fort Zeelandia at Tayowan (Anping) in southern Formosa was to provide a base for trading with China and Japan, as well as interfering with Portuguese and Spanish trade in the region. Goods traded included silks from China and silver from Japan, among many other things. After establishing their fortress, the Dutch realised the potential of the vast herds of the native Formosan sika deer (Cervus nippon taioanus) roaming the western plains of the island. The tough deer skins were highly prized by the Japanese, who used them to make samurai armour. Other parts of the deer were sold to Chinese traders for meat and medical use. The Dutch paid aborigines for the deer brought to them and tried to manage the deer stocks to keep up with demand. Unfortunately the deer the aborigines had relied on for their livelihoods began to disappear, forcing the aborigines to adopt new means of survival. However, the subspecies was kept alive in captivity and subsequent reintroduction of the subspecies into the wild has been successful. In 1638, the Dutch exported 151,400 deer hides from Taiwan to Japan. Although the number of deer hides exported to Japan dropped due to the deer population decreased, the considerable number of deer hides ranged from 50,000 to 80,000 was still exported. Tea was also a major export item. After Chinese people settled in Taiwan, they started to grow tea on less fertile hillsides where rice could not be cultivated.Huang, C 2011, 'Taiwan under the Dutch' in A new history of Taiwan, The Central News Agency, Taipei, p. 70. Although sugar cane was a native crop of Taiwan, the indigenous people had never been able to make sugar granules from the raw sugar.Tu, C 2003, 'The Deutch Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie' in Ilha Formosa: the emergence of Taiwan on the world scene in the 17th Century, Hwang Chao-sung, Taipei, p. 50. Chinese immigrants brought and introduce the technique to turn the raw sugar cane into sugar granules. Sugar became the most important export item as the main purpose of producing sugar was to export it to other countries.Huang, C 2011, 'Taiwan under the Dutch' in A new history of Taiwan, The Central News Agency, Taipei, p. 71. The sugar produced in Taiwan made far higher profit than the sugar produced in Java. About 300,000 catties of sugar, which was one third of the total production, were carried to Persia in 1645. In 1658, Taiwan produced 1,730,000 catties of sugar and 800,000 catties of them were shipped to Persia and 600,000 catties to Japan. The rest was exported to Batavia. Tea was also a major export item. Another one of Taiwan's major export items was sulfur collected from near Keelung and Tamsui. Taiwan, especially Taoyuan, became an important transshipment center for East Asian trade networks.Tu, C 2003, 'The Deutch Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie' in Ilha Formosa: the emergence of Taiwan on the world scene in the 17th Century, Hwang Chao-sung, Taipei, p. 46. The products from Japan, Fukienn, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia were shipped to Taiwan, and then exported to other countries as the markets demanded. The Dutch exported amber, spices, pepper, lead, tin, hemp, cotton, opium and kapok from Southeast Asia through Batavia to China by way of Taiwan and carried silk, porcelain, gold, and herbs from China to Japan and Europe via Taiwan.Lin, ACJ & Keating, JF 2008, 'The era of global navigation' in Island in the stream: a quick case study of Taiwan's complex history, SMC Publishing Inc., Taipei, p. 8. Agriculture The Dutch also employed Chinese to farm sugarcane and rice for export; some of this rice and sugar was exported as far as the markets of Persia. Attempts to persuade aboriginal tribesmen to give up hunting and adopt a sedentary farming lifestyle were unsuccessful because \\"for them, farming had two major drawbacks: first, according to the traditional sexual division of labor, it was women's work; second, it was labor-intensive drudgery.\\" The Dutch therefore imported labour from China, and the era was the first to see mass Chinese immigration to the island, with one commentator estimating that 50‚Äì60,000 Chinese settled in Taiwan during the 37 years of Dutch rule. These settlers were encouraged with free transportation to the island, often on Dutch ships, and tools, oxen and seed to start farming. In return, the Dutch took a tenth of agricultural production as a tax. Taxation After the Dutch took control over Taiwan, they immediately levied a tax on all the import and export duties. Although the rates of such taxation are unknown as there are no records, the Dutch must have made a lot of profit from the export duties received by Chinese and Japanese traders. This resulted in the friction between the Dutch and the Japanese causing the Hamada Yahei incident in 1628.Lin, ACJ & Keating, JF 2008, 'The era of global navigation' in Island in the stream: a quick case study of Taiwan's complex history, SMC Publishing Inc., Taipei, p. 7. Another form of taxation was the poll tax which the Dutch levied on every person who was not Dutch and above six years of age. At first, the rate of the poll tax was set at a quarter of a real whereas the Dutch, later on, increased the rate to a half real. In 1644, the total amount of the poll tax imposed was 33,7000 reals and in 1644, over 70,000 reals were imposed. Coupled with restrictive land tenancy policies and extortion by Dutch soldiers, the tax provided grounds for the major insurrections of 1640 and 1652. The Dutch imposed a tax on hunting as well. They sold a license to dig a pit-trap for 15 reals a month and a license for snaring was sold for one real. During the hunting season between October 1638 and March 1639, the total amount of the hunt tax was 1,998.5 reals. There were no licenses for fishing while it was taxed. By 1653, the Dutch revenue from Taiwan was estimated at 667,701 gulden 3 stuiver and 12 penning, including the revenue of 381,930 from tradings. This indicates that for Dutch, taxation became the important way of making profit in Taiwan. Demographics Taiwanese aborigines, from Olfert Dapper (1670): Gedenkwaerdig bedryf Prior to the arrival of the Dutch colonists, Taiwan was almost exclusively populated by Taiwanese aborigines; Austronesian peoples who lived in a hunter-gatherer society while also practicing swidden agriculture. It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the numbers of these native Formosans when the Dutch arrived, as there was no island-wide authority in a position to count the population, while the aborigines themselves did not keep written records. Even at the extent of greatest Dutch control in the 1650s there were still large regions of the island outside the pale of Dutch authority, meaning that any statistics given necessarily relate only to the area of Dutch sovereignty. Ethnicity The population of Dutch Formosa was composed of three main groups; the aborigines, the Dutch contingent, and the Chinese. There were also a number of Spanish people resident in the north of the island between 1626 and 1642 in the area around Keelung and Tamsui. At times there were also a handful of Japanese-Korean trader-pirates known as Wak≈ç operating out of coastal areas outside Dutch control. =Aborigines= The native Formosan peoples had been in Taiwan for thousands of years before the Dutch arrived. Estimates of the total numbers of aborigines in Taiwan are difficult to come by, but one commentator suggests that there were 150,000 over the entire island during the Dutch era. They lived in villages with populations ranging from a couple of hundred up to around 2,000 people for the biggest towns, with different groups speaking different Formosan languages which were not mutually intelligible. =Dutch= The Dutch contingent was initially composed mostly of soldiers, with some slaves and other workers from the other Dutch colonies, particularly the area around Batavia (current day Jakarta). The number of soldiers stationed on the island waxed and waned according to the military needs of the colony, from a low of 180 troops in the early days to a high of 1,800 shortly before Koxinga's invasion. There were also a number of other personnel, from traders and merchants to missionaries and schoolteachers, plus the Dutch brought with them slaves from their other colonies, who mainly served as personal slaves for important Dutch people. Dutch women were kept as sexual partners by the Chinese after the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan in 1662. During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek, two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding that he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, assuring them that Koxinga's troops were growing hungry and rebellious, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation. In addition to this, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation. A few women and children were also killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine; she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as \\"a very sweet and pleasing maiden\\". The other Dutch women were distributed to Koxinga's commanders, who used them as concubines. Alt URL The daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that \\"the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and then sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.\\" Some Dutch physical characteristics such as auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode of Dutch women becoming concubines to the Chinese commanders. The Dutch women who were taken as slave concubines and wives were never freed. In 1684 some were reported to be living in captivity. A Dutch merchant in Quemoy was contacted with an arrangement, proposed by a son of Koxinga's, to release the prisoners, but it came to nothing. Dutch- language accounts record this incident of Chinese taking Dutch women as concubines and the date of Hambroek's daughter. =Han people= When the Dutch arrived in Taiwan there was already a network of Han traders living on the island, buying merchandise (particularly deer products) from the native Formosans. This network has been estimated at some 1,000‚Äì1,500 people, almost all male, most of whom were seasonal residents in Taiwan, returning to Fujian in the off-season. Beginning in the 1640s the Dutch began to encourage large- scale immigration of Han people to Formosa, providing not only transportation from Fujian, but also oxen and seed for the new immigrants to get started in agriculture. Estimates of the numbers of Han people in Taiwan at the end of the Dutch era vary widely, from 10‚Äì15,000 up to 50‚Äì60,000, although the lower end of that scale seems more likely. =Others= The Dutch had Pampang and Quinamese (Vietnamese) slaves on their colony in Taiwan, and in 1643 offered rewards to aboriginal allies who would recapture the slaves for them when they ran away. 18 Quinamese and Java slaves were involved in a Dutch attack against the Tammalaccouw aboriginals, along with 110 Chinese and 225 troops under Governor Traudenius on 11 January 1642. 7 Quinamese and 3 Javanese were involved in a gold hunting expedition along with 200 Chinese and 218 troops under Sernior Merchant Cornelis Caesar from November 1645 to January 1646. \\"Quinam\\" was the Dutch name for the Vietnamese Nguyen Lord ruled Cochinchina (which used in the 17th century to refer to the area around Quang Nam in central Vietnam, (Annam) until in 1860 the French shifted the term Cochinchina to refer to the Mekong Delta in the far south, and Pampang was a place in Java which was ruled by the Dutch East India Company in the East Indies. The Dutch sided with the Tr·ªãnh lords of Tonkin (Northern Vietnam) against the Nguyen Lords of Quinam (Cochinchina) during the Tr·ªãnh‚ÄìNguy·ªÖn War and were therefore hostile to Quinam. Taiwanese natives under Dutch Formosa=Background Before Dutch settlement in the seventeenth century, Taiwanese aborigines lived in numerous tribal systems uniquely autonomous of each other; with populations between a thousand and a hundred, a census conducted by Dutch colonizers in 1650 surmised that there were below 50,000 natives in the plains area. Despite temporary alliances, similar agricultural practices, and a few inter- marriages, the tribes exhibited distinct linguistic and internal structure differences. These differences coupled with the widespread practice of head- hunting caused Formosan groups to be suspicious and cautious of strangers. Upon arrival, the first indigenous groups the Dutch made contact with were the Sinkang (Êñ∞Ê∏Ø), Backloan (ÁõÆÂä†Ê∫úÁÅ£), Soelangh (Ëï≠), and Mattauw (È∫ªË±Ü). The native Taiwanese tribes‚Äô antagonistic predispositions led to an initial hostile relationship with the colonizers, involving several uprisings including the Hamada Yahei incident of 1628 involving the Sinkang people, and the killing of 20 Dutch soldiers in 1629 by the Mattauw tribe. VOC eventually transitioned into a divide-and-conquer strategy, and went on to create an alliance with the Sinkang and Seolangh tribes against Mattauw, simultaneously conquering numerous tribes that did not comply with these commands. This interventionist process included the massacre of the indigenous people inhabiting Lamay Island in 1642 by Dutch forces led by Officer Francois Caron. After these events, the native aborigines eventually were forced into pacification under military domination and were used for a variety of labor activities during the span of Dutch Formosa. According to documents in 1650, Dutch settlers ruled ‚Äú315 tribal villages with a total population of around 68,600, estimated 40-50% of the entire indigenes of the island‚Äù. Religion One of the key pillars of the Dutch colonial era was conversion of the natives to Christianity. From the descriptions of the early missionaries, the native religion was animist in nature, in one case presided over by priestesses called Inibs. The Formosans also practiced various activities which the Dutch perceived as sinful or at least uncivilised, including mandatory abortion (by massage) for women under 37, frequent marital infidelity, non-observation of the Christian Sabbath and general nakedness. The Christian Bible was translated into native aboriginal languages and evangelised among the tribes. This marks the first recorded instance of Christianity entering into Taiwanese history, and preludes to the active Christian practices experienced in Taiwan in modern times. Education The missionaries were also responsible for setting up schools in the villages under Dutch control, teaching not only the religion of the colonists but also other skills such as reading and writing. Prior to Dutch arrival the native inhabitants did not use writing, and the missionaries created a number of romanization schemes for the various Formosan languages. This is the first record in history of a written language in Taiwan. Experiments were made with teaching native children the Dutch language, however these were abandoned fairly rapidly after they failed to produce good results. At least one Formosan received an education in the Netherlands; he eventually married a Dutch woman and was apparently well integrated into Dutch society. Technology The unique variety of trading resources (in particular, deerskins, venison and sugarcane), as well as the untouched nature of Formosa led to an extremely lucrative market for VOC. A journal record written by the Dutch Governor Pieter Nuyts holds that \\"Taiwan was an excellent trading port, enabling 100 per cent profits to be made on all goods\\"., described in English at In monopolizing on these goods, Taiwanese natives were used as manual labor, whose skills were honed in the employment on sugarcane farms and deer hunting. Similarly, Dutch colonizers upheaved the traditional agricultural practices in favor of more modern systems. The native tribes in the field-regions were taught how to use Western systems of crop management that used more sustainable and efficient ecological technologies, albeit attributed mostly to the fact that due to the increased exploitation of the land, alternative means of management were needed to veer off the extinction of deer and sugar resources. The Dutch introduced well- digging,Murray Rubinstein, (1999) A New History of Taiwan, M.E. Sharpe Inc, New York 66. as well as bringing both oxen and cattle to the island. Military Taiwanese aborigines became an important part of maintaining a stable milieu and eliminating conflicts during the latter half of Dutch rule. According to the Daily Journals of Fort Zeelandia (), Dutch colonizers frequently employed males from nearby indigenous tribes, including Hsin-kang (Êñ∞Ê∏Ø) and Mattau (È∫ªË±Ü) as foot-soldiers in the general militia, to heighten their numbers when quick action was needed during rebellions or uprisings. Such was the case during that of the Guo Huaiyi Revolt in 1652, where the conspirators were eventually bested and subdued by the Dutch through the sourcing of over a hundred native Taiwanese aborigines. However, the Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks. Legacy and contributions Fort Anping. Fort Anthonio today. Today their legacy in Taiwan is visible in the Anping District of Tainan City, where the remains of their Castle Zeelandia are preserved; in Tainan City itself, where their Fort Provintia is still the main structure of what is now called Red-Topped Tower; and finally in Tamsui, where Fort Antonio (part of the Fort San Domingo museum complex) still stands as the best preserved redoubt (minor fort) of the Dutch East India Company anywhere in the world. The building was later used by the British consulate until the United Kingdom severed ties with the KMT (Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang) regime and its formal relationship with Taiwan. Similarly, much of the economic policies driven by the Dutch during the colonial period were subsequently used as a basis for the beginnings of Taiwan's modern international trade; the beginnings of Taiwan's mercantile history and contemporary economy can be attributed to the port systems that were facilitated during the Dutch Formosa period. However, perhaps the most lasting result of Dutch rule is the immigration of Chinese to the island. At the start of the Dutch era, there were estimated to be between 1,000‚Äì1,500 Chinese in Taiwan, mostly traders living in aboriginal villages. During Dutch Formosa rule, Dutch colonial policies encouraged the active immigration of Han Chinese in order to solidify the ecological and agricultural trade establishments, and help maintain control over the area. Because of these reasons, by the end of the colonial period, Taiwan had many Chinese villages holding tens of thousands of people in total, and the ethnic balance of the island was already well on the way to favouring the newly arrived Chinese over the aboriginal tribes. Furthermore, Dutch settlers opened up communication between both peoples, and set about maintaining relationships with both Han Chinese and native Taiwanese ‚Äì which were non-existent beforehand.

He was born Wang Libin in Puli Town in Suzhou prefecture. Life Shanghai in Wang Tao's Travel Notes In 1848, Wang Tao went to Shanghai to visit his father. During his stay in Shanghai, Wang Tao visited the London Missionary Society Press. He was warmly greeted by Walter Henry Medhurst and his daughters Mary and Ellen. Wang Tao also met missionaries William Muirhead, Joseph Edkins, and William Charles Milne, all well versed in spoken and written Chinese language. Work with the London Missionary Society In 1849 Wang Tao's father died. Wang Tao was looking for a job to support his family. He was offered a job by Walter Henry Medhurst at the London Missionary Society Press in Shanghai assisting in his translation of the New Testament into Chinese. Wang Tao worked at the London Missionary Society Press for the next 13 years. In this period, he also translated many English books into Chinese in collaboration with missionaries Alexander Wylie and Joseph Edkins. These included Pictorial Optics, An Elementary Introduction to Mechanics, Concise History of Sino-British Trade, and A History of Astronomy of the Western Countries. Refuge in Hong Kong Drawing of Hong Kong in Wang Tao's 1887 travelog The middle of the 19th century was a period of turmoil in China. In 1860, the Taiping Rebellion had captured Suzhou, Changzhou, and was threatening Shanghai. During this period, Wang Tao was in contact with the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In 1862, he even wrote a letter under the pseudonym Wang Wan to a Taiping leader, proposing tactics against the Qing military and suggesting that westerners were not the enemy of Taiping. He stated that the real enemy was the Qing government; if the Taiping army could achieve victory over the Qing army led by Zeng Guofan, then the westerners might take side with the Taiping Kingdom. When the Qing army captured Shanghai, this letter fell into the hands of the Qing government, and the Tongzhi Emperor ordered Wang Tao to be arrested. He took refuge in the British Consulate, remaining there for more than four months. In October 1862, a disguised Wang Tao, escorted by several people from the British Consulate, boarded an Ewo ship ÊÄ°Âíå for Hong Kong. This is how he left his homeland to which he was not to return for twenty-two years. In Hong Kong, he changed his name from Wang Libin to Wang Tao. In Hong Kong, James Legge, the principal of the Anglo-Chinese College invited Wang Tao to stay at the London Mission Society hostel and to assist him in the translation of The Thirteen Classics. By 1865, Legge and Wang had completed the translation of Shang Shu and The Bamboo Book Annals. In this period, Wang Tao also took on the job of editor in chief of a Chinese newspaper Hua Zi News in Hong Kong, this was the beginning of his journalism career. Move to Scotland Paris In 1867, James Legge returned to his native Scotland, settling in the small town of Dollar in Clackmannanshire. He wrote a letter to Wang Tao, inviting him to come to Scotland to continue assisting in the translation of more Chinese classics. Wang Tao boarded a ship and departed from Hong Kong. The ship stopped over at Singapore, Ceylon, Penang, Aden, Messina, and Cairo before reaching Marseille. The voyage from Hong Kong to Marseille took more than forty days. Wang Tao took the opportunity of sightseeing in all the ports of call. From Marseille, he took a train to Lyon, then to Paris. He visited the Louvre, and also visited the sinologist Stanislas Julien at the Sorbonne. After a short stay of a little under two weeks, Wang Tao crossed the English Channel from Calais to Dover and rode a train to London. After sightseeing in London (The British Museum etc.), he headed to Scotland and settled down in Dollar. During his journey Wang Tao jotted down his impressions of the places he visited. He later collected part of these material into his travel book, Jottings from Carefree Travel (1890), the very first travel book about Europe by a Chinese scholar. The British Museum In 1867 Wang Tao was invited by the Chamberlain of Oxford University to deliver a speech in Chinese, the first ever speech delivered by a Chinese scholar in Oxford. He talked about the importance of cultural exchange between east and west, and claimed that the whole world was heading toward a common great unity (). Wang Tao in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, Scotland Edinburgh By the Spring of 1870 the translation of various classics such as The Book of Songs, I Ching, and The Book of Rites were completed. During 1867-1870, Wang Tao travelled to many places, including Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Huntly, Dundee and Glasgow, or took short trips to Rumbling Bridge Park, Castle Campbell, Tillicoultry, Alva and Stirling Castle; sometimes accompanied by James Legge and his third daughter Mary. The travel notes about these places were also included in Jottings of Carefree Travel. Return to Hong Kong Having finished his part in the translation of the Chinese Classics, Wang Tao returned to Hong Kong in the winter of 1870. In Hong Kong, he wrote two influential books: A Brief Introduction to France and Report on the Franco-Prussian War. The latter was highly regarded by high mandarins of the Qing government, including Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and paved the way for his final pardon by the Qing government later. In 1872, Wang Tao bought the printing press of London Mission in Hong Kong and founded the Zhong Hua General Printing House. On February 5, 1874 Wang Tao founded Tsun- wan yat-po (1874‚Äì1947, Universal Circulating Herald), the first Chinese daily newspaper in history. Lin Yutang called Wang Tao the 'Father of the Chinese Newspaper'. During his ten-year career as editor in chief of Universal Circulating Herald, Wang Tao penned close to a thousand editorials calling for the reform of the Chinese political system, by adopting a British style parliamentary monarchy. He also called for reform of the educational system by introducing western science to the curriculum; he called for the establishment of textile, railway, machinery and mining industries. His reformist editorial articles reached a wide audience. He was the de facto forerunner of the reformist movement in China. Many of his reformist articles were later published as a volume: Collection of Essays from The Tao Garden. Visit to Japan In 1879, at the invitation of Japanese literati, including Nakamura Masanao. Wang Tao spent over four months in Japan. He visited many cities such as Nagasaki, Nagoya and Tokyo, and notes of this journey became one of his books: A Record of Travels in Japan (Fu-sang yu-chi). In Japan, wherever he went, he was surrounded by literati, and sometimes rode in sedan chairs carried by eight men. As a scholar who had lived in Europe and who had an in- depth understanding of European politics and culture, he enjoyed very high esteem in Japan. His travel needs were taken care of by the Qing Embassy in Japan. Wang Tao was apparently quite moved by his warm welcome in Japan; he wrote that when he left Japan, he was treated with a grand dinner party attended by more than one hundred celebrities, and that he never thought he could become so famous and important, because during his youth at Puli township, he was a nobody. \\"How lucky I am to get such welcome by foreign scholars several thousand miles away\\". Wang expressed an admiration for Japan's modernisation through selective use of Western institutions and technology; however, later he became distrustful of Japan's foreign policy, especially after the annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Return to Shanghai The fame Wang Tao enjoyed overseas must have affected the Qing government. In 1884, the influential Li Hongzhang sent a letter to the governor of Shanghai, writing: \\"That gentleman from Kunshan is a rare genius with encyclopedic knowledge. It is a pity he took exile in Hong Kong, if it is possible to get his service for us, we don't mind a king's ransom\\". In the spring of 1884, Wang Tao and his family returned to Shanghai and settled down in Wusong district, he also founded Tao Garden Publishing House. He nicknamed himself \\"The Recluse of Tao Garden\\". In 1886, Wang Tao became the head of Gezhi College in Shanghai, where he promoted Western style education. In 1890, Wang Tao published his travelog Jottings from Carefree Travels. He also worked part-time for Shen Pao and International Tribune as special columnist; he wrote about two hundred short stories for Shen Pao, China's most important journal of the age. In April 1897 Wang Tao died in Shanghai at age 70. Impact Many Chinese literati before Wang Tao introduced western ideas and translated books into Chinese. Wang Tao was the first Chinese scholar who participated in two way cultural exchange; on the one hand, Wang Tao worked with W.A. Medhurst, A. Wylie and J. Edkins to translate western religion books and western sciences into China; on the other hand, he also played an important role in assisting James Legge in the translation of a large number of important ancient Chinese classics into English. Wang Tao forged a bridge between China and the West. Wang Tao Memorial Hall is located in a Qing style house at No 6. Zhongshi Street, Luzhi township, Suzhou city, China.

He played in Major League Baseball as a starting pitcher from 1961 to 1975, most notably for the Cleveland Indians. A six-time All-Star, McDowell led the American League in strikeouts five times. Tall (6 feet, 5 inches) and powerful, his left-handed fastball was delivered with an unusually calm pitching motion which led to his memorable nickname, Sudden Sam.  With the Indians = 1960-61: Major league debut  Prior to the 1960 season, McDowell signed with the Indians for a $75,000 bonus.Sam McDowell at The Baseball Biography Project After spending 1960 with the Class-D Lakeland Indians, he was promoted to the Triple-A Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. He finished the year there with a record of 13-10 and a 4.42 earned run average. This was enough to earn him a promotion to the majors in September, and one week before his 19th birthday he made his MLB debut for the Indians. Starting against the Minnesota Twins, McDowell pitched 6.2 scoreless innings, giving up just three hits. However, in a harbinger of things to come, he also walked five batters before being relieved by Frank Funk. Funk gave up three runs in the 9th inning to lose the game, 3-2.September 15, 1961 box score McDowell did not pitch again in 1961.  1962-63: Struggle to establish himself  McDowell started the next season in Salt Lake City, but was quickly called up in mid-April for a start against the New York Yankees. His second start was not as good as his first: although the Indians won 9-3, McDowell did not make it out of the fifth inning, once again walking five batters and failing to qualify for a win.April 22, 1962 box score McDowell remained with the Indians as a swingman until the end of May, when he was sent back to the minors with a 6.04 ERA and 24 walks in 25.1 innings. After posting a 2.02 ERA in 6 games, he was recalled in July. The results were similar, as he finished with an ERA of 6.06 and 70 walks (a rate of 7.2 BB/9), but also 70 strikeouts in 87.2 innings. McDowell's 1963 season represented something of an improvement over 1962. He started out well, pitching his first major league complete game on April 16 against the Washington Senators. McDowell gave up just two hits while striking out 13, but his control continued to be an issue as he also walked seven hitters.April 16, 1963 box score Although he improved his ERA to 4.85 and his BB/9 to 6.1 while increasing his K/9 to 8.7, McDowell was sent down to the Indians top farm club (now the Jacksonville Suns) at the end of June and spent the rest of the season there. He also threw seven wild pitches, ninth-most in the league, despite only pitching 65 innings.  1964: Breakout season  In 1964, the Indians again switched farm teams, this time assigning McDowell to the Portland Beavers. McDowell started out the season on fire, winning all eight of his decisions in only nine starts, including a no-hitter, with an impressive ERA of 1.18. Perhaps more impressively for Sam, he struck out 102 batters while walking just 24 in 76 innings. Once again, he was called up to the majors. It would be the last time McDowell would spend in the minor leagues. After winning a game in relief on May 31, McDowell pitched a complete game on June 2 against the Chicago White Sox, beating the White Sox 3-2. In a sign that his control might be coming around, he walked just three in the game while striking out 14. He continued to show flashes of brilliance during the season, finishing with a record of 11-6 with an ERA of 2.70, seventh-best in the American League. He also led the league in K/9 with 9.2, striking out 177 in 173.1 innings. His strikeout total was good for eighth in the AL. His BB/9 also continued to improve, dropping to 5.2, although he still walked an even 100 hitters, the fourth-highest total in the league.  1965: Superstar  If 1964 was the year McDowell established himself as a major leaguer, 1965 was the year he showed that he was among the elite pitchers in the league. He was selected to the All-Star team in 1965, the first of six such selections over his career. He pitched two innings in the 1965 All-Star Game and wound up taking the loss for the AL.1965 All-Star Game box score At the end of the year, \\"Sudden Sam\\" was at the top of several American League leader lists, including ERA (2.18), strikeouts (325), K/9 (10.7), Hits per nine innings (5.9) and home runs per nine innings (0.3). The strikeout total stands as the second-highest in franchise history to Bob Feller's 348 in 1946.Cleveland Indians Top 10 Pitching Leaders His 273 innings pitched were second only to the Yankees' Mel Stottlemyre. He also finished 17th in the voting for Most Valuable Player. His control was perhaps the only flaw on his excellent season, as he also led the league in most walks allowed with 132, even though his BB/9 rate continued to drop, to 4.4. The Indians were also improving, as they finished the season with their first winning record since 1959, with McDowell leading the way. Together with Sonny Siebert, Sam was the first American League starting pitcher duo to post K/9 rates over 9. The Indians pitching staff as a whole led the AL with 1156 strikeouts, leading the league for the first of what would be five straight seasons.  1966-67: Bumps in the road  McDowell slumped somewhat in 1966. Although he started hot, he missed several games due to arm problems during the year. While he led the league in strikeouts for the second straight season, his total dropped to 225, as he managed just 194.1 innings. He posted a 2.87 ERA but won only nine games against eight losses. Of those nine wins, five were shutouts, a total that also led the league. He also made his second All-Star team, although he did not appear in the game. In 1967, although he didn't miss any time, McDowell's numbers continued to decline. He won 13 games while losing 15, and he led the league in walks allowed, earned runs allowed, and wild pitches while posting a below-average 3.85 ERA. He also failed to lead the league in K/9 for the first time since becoming a full-time major leaguer, finishing second to teammate Luis Tiant with a 9.0 rate. The team as a whole set a record by striking out 1189 batters. One of his few personal highlights came not as a pitcher, but as a batter, as he hit his first major league home run on May 21 off Boston Red Sox pitcher Bucky Brandon.  1968-69: Returning to form  In 1968, the last season before the lowering of the pitcher's mound to 10 inches above ground, Major League Baseball went through what is often called the \\"Year of the Pitcher\\". Fittingly, it was also the year McDowell began to return to his pre-1966 form. He posted a career-best 1.81 ERA, second to Luis Tiant, who posted a 1.60 mark. He also returned to his place atop the leader boards in strikeouts (283) and K/9 (9.5). While he led the league in walks allowed with 110, he posted his best BB/9 rate to date with a 3.7. McDowell's own record was 15-14. In 1969, McDowell won 18 games, his best total thus far, while losing 14. He continued to lead the league in strikeouts (279) and K/9 (8.8). Although it was the first season McDowell had posted a strikeout rate of less than 9, he also posted a career-low BB/9 at 3.2, and for the first time did not lead the league in total walks allowed without missing time due to injuries or time in the minors, finishing sixth with 102. His 18 complete games were the third-most in the AL, and his four shutouts were fourth-most. He also was selected to the All-Star Game for the fourth time, striking out four batters in two innings, including Roberto Clemente.1969 All-Star Game box score On June 27, he notched his 1,500th career strikeout.  1970: Pitcher of the Year  In 1970, McDowell put together some impressive totals. For the first and only time in his career, he reached the 20-win mark, posting a record of 20-12. He also led the American League in innings pitched, topping the 300 mark (also for the first and only time) at 305. He reached the 300-strikeout mark as well for the first time since 1965 at 304, just barely missing out on a K/9 rate of 9.0, although he led the league in both those categories again. He also threw a career-high 19 complete games, second in the league to Mike Cuellar, giving him 37 complete games in the last two seasons. All this, combined with a fifth-best 2.92 ERA, led to his selection as \\"AL Pitcher of the Year\\" by The Sporting News. However, there were still some warning signs, as McDowell's BB/9 jumped back up to 3.9, and he led the league in walks allowed with 131. He led the league in wild pitches again with 17, the first time he had done so since 1967. He also gave up a career-high 25 home runs. During a July 6 game against the Senators, McDowell became the last left-handed player to earn a fielding chance at second base.  1971: End of the line in Cleveland  1971 started on a rocky note for the newly minted Pitcher of the Year. He held out during spring training, hoping for a six- figure contract. The contract he did sign was voided by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn because it contained illegal incentive clauses, and McDowell decided to leave the team again. He eventually returned to the team, only to be suspended again later in the season. Among all the turmoil, McDowell's performance suffered. His record slipped to 13-17, and his ERA jumped to 3.40. His K/9 was just 8.0, lowest since 1962, although it was still second in the league. However, his control problems returned full-force, as he walked a career-high 153 batters in just 214.2 innings for a BB/9 of 6.4, also his worst since 1962. At the end of the season, McDowell demanded a trade, and Indians general manager Gabe Paul obliged. On November 29, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher Gaylord Perry and shortstop Frank Duffy.  Later career = San Francisco Giants  The trade turned out to be a disaster for the Giants. In 1972, McDowell had his worst season as a starting pitcher, posting his highest earned run average since 1963 at 4.33 while posting a 10-8 record. Although his control settled down a bit, as he posted a 4.7 BB/9 in 164.1 innings, he pitched just four complete games and failed to post a shutout for the first time since 1962, while his K/9 fell to 6.7, his worst to date. Meanwhile, Perry posted 24 wins with a 1.92 earned run average for Cleveland, winning his first Cy Young Award. McDowell was sent to the bullpen to start the 1973 season. He had contemplated retirement during the offseason due to persistent back and neck pains, but he felt better after treatment and returned to the team. He started just three games for the Giants in the first two months, appearing 15 times in relief. He had a 1-2 record for the Giants with three saves and a 4.50 ERA. On June 7 McDowell was sold by the Giants to the Yankees in a straight cash deal.Yanks buy McDowell  New York Yankees  McDowell was moved back into the starting rotation for the Yankees, and his numbers improved somewhat. He started off hot, winning five of his first six starts, but failed to win another game after that. With the Yankees in 1973, he went 5-8 with a 3.95 ERA. In 1974, McDowell was again hampered by injuries. A slipped disc cost him two months of the season, and even when he was available to pitch, he was used sparingly, appearing in only 13 games, seven of them starts. His results on the field continued to decline, as he posted career-worsts in K/9 (6.2) and BB/9 (7.7), winning just one game while losing six with a 4.69 ERA. On September 13, he left the team, and after the season asked for and was granted his release.  Pittsburgh Pirates  McDowell did not sign a contract until almost Opening Day in 1975, finally catching on with the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 2 after having to fight for a job during spring training. He returned to the bullpen, and his numbers began to improve. In 14 games for the Pirates, he posted a 2.86 ERA, while his K/9 (7.5) and BB/9 (5.2) both improved over the past two seasons. However, it wasn't enough, as the Pirates released him on June 26.  Post-retirement  Following his \\"retirement\\", McDowell's drinking increased to the point where it cost him his marriage. His wife left him, taking their two children with her, leaving him desolate and broke.Making His Pitch, St. Petersburg Times, March 14, 2003 A failed business venture had left McDowell $190,000 in debt, and by early 1980 was living with his parents at his childhood home in Pittsburgh while selling insurance. Eventually, McDowell checked himself into Gateway Rehab, a rehabilitation facility located outside of Pittsburgh.'Sudden Sam' emerged from alcoholism a winner, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, December 7, 2011 After repaying his debts, he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned associate degrees in sports psychology and addiction. Eventually, McDowell returned to the major leagues as a sports addiction counselor with the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers. McDowell earned a World Series ring while working with the 1993 Blue Jays. McDowell also works as a consultant with the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT) and the Major League Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA). In 2001, McDowell remarried, and started a retirement community for former players. He became chairman and CEO at The City of Legends, a retirement resort in Clermont, Florida. McDowell married a second time after meeting Eva, a Slovak tourist, when asking for directions in Florida. The character of Sam Malone, the alcoholic ex-Red Sox pitcher portrayed by Emmy Award winning actor Ted Danson in the television program Cheers, was based on the baseball life of McDowell. In a 2011 interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, McDowell joked \\"I would say I'm better with women than [Sam Malone] was,\\"  Career summary  McDowell finished with 2,453 career strikeouts and an average of 8.86 strikeouts per nine innings pitched, ranking him ninth all-time as of 2011. At the time of his retirement, his strikeout rate was bested by only two pitchers: Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax. His ratio of 7.03 hits allowed per nine innings also places him ninth all-time as of 2011. He ranks eighth all time on the list of career ten or more strikeout games with 74, tied with Bob Gibson.(Half) Marathon Men: 10-Strikeout Game Leaders by Franchise His 2,159 strikeouts as an Indian place him second all time on the team's career list, behind Bob Feller. In four All- Star appearances, McDowell struck out twelve NL All-Stars over eight innings, and was the losing pitcher (in relief) in the 1965 game.

As a vice president of Philips Electronics, he was responsible for the Compact Disc as well as for CD-i, CD-ROM, Philips' contributions to the MPEG standard and the foundations for the DVD. After graduating with distinction from the KU Leuven (Belgium) in Electrical and Nuclear Engineering, Bastiaens served in the military from 1971 to 1972. In 1972 he joined the Hi-Fi division of Philips Electronics in Leuven, where he served in various management capacities until 1982. During his earlier years there he created a number of new production methods, including for the assembly of loudspeaker systems, manufacturing of tuners and component insertion in printed circuit boards. By introducing new strategies including CAD/CAM, he was later able to reduce the development time of Hi-Fi components from 18 months to nine. In 1983 Bastiaens was promoted to the Philips headquarters in Eindhoven where he became a general manager and director with worldwide responsibility for the Compact Disc project. Between 1983 and 1986 he oversaw a multi-divisional engineering effort the bring the cost of a compact disc player from 1150 Dutch guilders down to 220. The project was internally called \\"25‚Äì250\\": By reducing the cost of key components such as the laser module, the drive unit, the decoding circuit, etc. to 25 guilders each, the target was to enable Philips to build the product for 250 guilders. Bastiaens then concentrated on selling OEM licenses for the CD technology as well as maintaining a global market share of 20 percent in Compact Disc mechanisms for Philips. He was also responsible of diversification efforts such as CD-ROM and CD-ROM XA. From 1988‚Äì92 Bastiaens was general manager and director of the Multimedia Division of Philips Consumer Electronics. Jan Timmer, then Philips' head of Consumer Electronics, gave him four months to make or break the Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I) project, a joint effort between Sony and Philips to enhance the CD standard with multi-media technology. This so-called \\"Green Book\\" standard had been in development since 1985 but was still in the concept phase when Bastiaens took charge. He started out by changing the project to \\"full motion video\\", which would enable a CD-I disc to hold a full-length feature movie but was rather ambitious at the time, as the compression and decoding hard- and software had yet to be developed. The success of the project also hinged on the creation of software and tools to create the content which would be essential in driving the market. Bastiaens moved the project into the MPEG standard, getting Philips more actively involved in that technology. By the time the first CD-I products where launched in 1992, using the MPEG-1 standard for video, development of MPEG-2 technology was well under way for the upcoming DVD technology, which used a red laser for encoding more than eleven times as much information on a disk of the same size as a CD, which used a yellow laser. In 1992 Bastiaens was approached by Apple CEO John Sculley to move to Apple Computer as a vice president, and the first General Manager of Apple's newly formed Personal Interactive Electronics (PIE) division in the early 1990s. In this role, he oversaw the launch of the Apple Newton. He was president of Quarterdeck. In 1996, he became president, and CEO of Lernout & Hauspie.L&H; Executives, Gaston Bastiaens and John SeoPurchase L&H; Common Stock. In August 2000, he disputed a Wall Street Journal article about Korean sales. In 2001, he was accused of fraud, and extradited to Belgium. On 21 May 2007, he went to trial in Ghent, Belgium. In 2008, he demanded a full acquittal.LHSP: Gaston Bastiaens vraagt volledige vrijspraak On 20 September 2010 Gaston Bastiaens was sentenced to three years in prison and two years of probation. In December 2010, he appealed the sentence.

It is the largest shopping complex in the state of Iowa with a total gross leasable area of . It is also the fourth largest shopping complex in the Midwest, and the 24th largest shopping complex in the United States. The center is named after Jordan Creek, a tributary of the Raccoon River that was named after James Cunningham Jordan, the first person to settle in what is now West Des Moines. The mall's anchor stores are Lane Bryant, JoS. A. Bank, LensCrafters, Barnes & Noble, Jared Jewelry, Century Theatres, Dillard's, Scheels All Sports, Talbots, Evereve, and Pottery Barn. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Younkers. History=Proposal 1995 - 2004 Around 1995, the family of local businessman Art Wittern proposed the \\"Village at Oakbrook\\" to the city of West Des Moines on the site that the Witterns owned at 74th Street (later renamed Jordan Creek Parkway) and E.P. True Parkway. The village would have contained a mixture of commercial, residential, and office development that was intended to attract upscale retailers similar to those at Country Club Plaza in Kansas City. In 1999, following the success of Coral Ridge Mall in eastern Iowa, General Growth Properties chose the Wittern site for its proposed \\"town center\\" concept. General Growth unveiled plans for Jordan Creek Town Center in May 2000. Two of the Des Moines metropolitan area's existing malls, Merle Hay Mall and Valley West Mall, promptly sued the city of West Des Moines, claiming that it was illegal to use public money from tax increment financing to make improvements around the mall. The Iowa Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit on February 27, 2002, allowing construction of the $200 million complex to begin later that year. 2004‚Äìpresent Jordan Creek Town Center opened on August 4, 2004, attracting nearly 17 million shoppers in its first year. Jordan Creek led to short-term sales declines at the three existing regional malls in the Des Moines area (Merle Hay, Valley West, and Southridge) while accounting for nearly 37 percent of taxable sales at the four malls during the last three months of 2004. Jordan Creek also affected sales tax revenues in Dallas County, which jumped from $16.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $33.7 million in fiscal 2006. It has also spawned other new commercial developments in West Des Moines such as the West Glen Town Center near Interstate 35 and a new Wells Fargo office complex south of the mall. In May 2007, Iowa State University economists David Swenson and Liesl Eathington released a study showing that retail sales in the Dallas County portion of West Des Moines had increased by over $310 million, or 503.7 percent, during Jordan Creek's first two years of operation. At the same time, sales in the city of Des Moines decreased by nearly $194 million (5.2 percent) while sales in the Polk County portion of West Des Moines decreased by $22 million (2.4 percent). Smaller Dallas County cities like Adel and Perry also experienced declines in retail sales during this period. In February 2018, Iowa-based department store Von Maur announced it would construct a new location at the mall, with a planned opening in 2022. In April 2018, the parent company to the mall's Younkers department store announced it would cease operations and close all stores. The Jordan Creek store closed on August 29, 2018. Layout The town center has 142 stores and 25 restaurants and is composed of three districts: * The Shopping District - a two-level enclosed shopping mall anchored by Dillard's, Scheels, and a 20-screen Century Theatres cinema. The Shopping District at Jordan Creek Town Center, looking north from the lake * The Lake District - an outdoor plaza surrounding a man-made lake, featuring a Residence Inn by Marriott hotel, an amphitheater, and several casual dining restaurants. * The Village District - a power center anchored by Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, Dick's Sporting Goods, Nordstrom Rack, and Lowe's.

It runs seven productions each season from its two stages in Downtown Berkeley. History The company was founded in 1968, as the East Bay's first resident professional theatre. Michael Leibert was the founding artistic director, who was then succeeded by Sharon Ott in 1984. The company won the Regional Theatre Tony Award in 1997. The theater added the 600-seat proscenium Roda Theatre next door to its existing 400-seat asymmetrical thrust stage in 2001, as well as opening its Berkeley Rep School of Theatre the same year. Its current Artistic Director is Johanna Pfaelzer, who took on the position in September 2019. Managing Director Susan Medak is a board member and former President of the League of Resident Theatres. Productions are a mix of classic modern plays such as Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts and Terrence McNally's Master Class, the latter featuring Rita Moreno as opera diva Maria Callas, and significant recent plays with many West Coast premieres such as Mois√©s Kaufman's The Laramie Project and Tony Kushner's Homebody/Kabul and even world premieres such as Kushner's Hydriotaphia and Charles Mee's Fetes De La Nuit. The Roda Theatre In the past decade alone, Berkeley Rep has premiered new works by Culture Clash, David Edgar, Francesca Faridany, Leigh Fondakowski, Lillian Groag, Jordan Harrison, Geoff Hoyle, Naomi Iizuka, Charles Mee, and Stew. The Theatre has recently created a string of successes that transferred from Berkeley to Manhattan: Artistic Director Tony Taccone staged Sarah Jones' Tony Award-winning Bridge & Tunnel on Broadway in 2006, and helmed Tony Kushner and Maurice Sendak's Brundibar in 2007. That summer, Sarah Ruhl's Eurydice and Stew's Passing Strange both enjoyed extended off-Broadway runs. Passing Strange opened on Broadway in March 2008. Berkeley Rep bolsters its commitment to new works through The Ground Floor (Berkeley Rep's Center for the Creation and Development of New Work) and year-long Fellowship Program aimed at training the next generation of theatre professionals. In 2001, the theatre opened Berkeley Rep School of Theatre, which offers training in various theatrical disciplines for all ages and abilities. Located next door to Berkeley Rep's two stages, the School of Theatre also provides a home base for the company's outreach education programs with local teachers and classes. The Berkeley Rep School of Theatre also has a Teen Council made for bay area high school students interested in theatre. The Berkeley Rep Teen Council is most noted for its annual Teen One Acts Festival, completely written, directed, produced, and acted by students. The theatre opened their 2009‚Äì10 season with the first stage production of Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot. The hugely popular show was originally scheduled to run from September 4 through October 11, but was extended twice, finally ending on November 15, 2009.Crooks, Peter. \\"Green Day to debut American Idiot at Berkeley Rep\\" Diablo Magazine, March 2009. The show subsequently opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on April 20, 2010. The musical Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations, a jukebox musical based on the story of the Motown group The Temptations, started performance at Berkeley Rep August 31, 2018. It was originally scheduled to run through October 8, but was later extended through October 22 and again through November 5. The musical was the highest- grossing production in the theatre's history. The show had runs at other regional theaters before transferring to Broadway, opening at the Imperial Theatre on March 21, 2019. Recently, the theater partnered with convicted felon Garth Drabinsky to produce a new work. Drabinsky went to jail for fraud and causing the failure of Livent in 1998.

He fought during World War I, World War II and was the seventh and final commander of French Far East Expeditionary Corps during the First Indochina War. Navarre was in overall command during the decisive French defeat at the Battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. Navarre entered l'√âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1916 and in May 1917 was sent to the front with a cavalry unit, 2e r√©giment de hussards. By 15 August 1917 he earned command of a platoon. He was given a field promotion to Lieutenant 21 April 1918. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre with bronze star for his exemplary service between 28 September 1918 and 4 October 1918. In March 1919, he was transferred to Syria, then in 1922 to Germany with the Occupation Force. In 1927 he was sent to √âcole sup√©rieure de guerre, the War College. He participated in the pacification of the Atlas and southern Morocco from 1930 to 1934. From 1934 to 1936 he was a Captain in the 11e r√©giment de cuirassiers. From 1938 to 1940 he was assigned to the German section of the Intelligence Service of the General Staff. While there, he submitted a proposal code named \\"Desperado\\", outlining a plan to assassinate Hitler. The project drew little support from his superior, Colonel Louis Rivet, and was ultimately rejected by Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier.\\"Et si la France avait √©limin√© Adolf Hitler\\", Le Point, number 2043, 10 November 2011. After the Armistice of 22 June 1940, Navarre was appointed head of the intelligence and counter-espionage bureau of General Maxime Weygand in Algiers. When he was recalled in 1942 for his anti-German activities, he went underground, joining the Resistance as head of the ORA. He commanded an armored regiment of the 1st Army in the liberation of France. He was promoted to Brigadier General in 1945 and posted to Germany, where he held various positions including that of commander of 5e division blind√©e (5th Armored Division) and Chief of Staff of Marshal Alphonse Juin. He remained in Germany until May 1953, except for a brief assignment as a Division Commander in Algeria from 1948 to 1949. Navarre was appointed G√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e, equivalent of Lieutenant General, in 1952. In May 1953, Navarre replaced Raoul Salan as Commander of French forces in Indochina, in the midst of a war with the Viet Minh that was going badly. The French government wanted to stabilize the situation so that they could begin peace negotiations on favorable terms: military victory was no longer an objective.Jules Roy, The Battle of Dien Bien Phu. (New York: Carrol & Graf Publishers, Inc., 1963), p. 31. Navarre's instructions were to insure the safety of the troops under his command. Instead, he undertook Operation Castor on 20 November 1953. Five French battalions parachuted into ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß in the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley, a 20-km-long, 6-km-wide basin surrounded by hills. Navarre hoped to draw the Viet Minh into a pitched battle where he hoped to defeat them.Major Vincent J. Goulding, Jr., USMC. \\"Dien Bien Phu\\". (Quantico: Marine Corps Command and Staff College, 1985), p. 37. Authorities in France did not learn of the operation until six hours after it started. Things went wrong almost immediately. The French position came under heavy, unanticipated artillery fire from the surrounding hills. Troops were unable to execute any missions beyond the valley floor, limiting actions to patrols and local counterattacks. It became increasingly difficult to bring in supplies by air, or to provide air support. After intelligence reports on 3 December 1953 showed four enemy Divisions closing on ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß, Navarre issued instructions accepting battle and calling for ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß to be held at all costs.Bernard B. Fall, Hell in a Very Small Place, (New York: Da Capo Press, Inc., 1967), p. 44. By January 1954 he started exploring plans for withdrawal. He soon realized any breakout attempt would be suicidal.Jules Roy, The Battle of Dien Bien Phu. (New York: Carrol & Graf Publishers, Inc., 1963), p. 112 No significant attempt to break out was ever made. Complicating the situation, Navarre initiated a second offensive operation on 12 December 1953, committing nearly twice as many troops to Operation Atlante in south central Vietnam, over 400 miles from ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. Navarre saw Operation Atlante as his main effort; he did not believe that ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß would be a decisive operation. He even speculated that the loss of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß Dien was strategically acceptable.Fall, ibid, p. 45 Navarre failed to consider the devastating effect the loss would have on Army morale, and the resulting loss of political support for the war at home. By 13 March 1954 the attack on ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß had begun. The French garrison numbered about 13,000; the Viet Minh massed more than 50,000 men.Goulding, ibid, pp. 19-20. After some initial success, Operation Atlante quickly bogged down into a series of Viet Minh ambushes on French convoys. The French eventually terminated Operation Atlante with no tangible gains while ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß was lost on 7 May 1954, after a siege of 54 days. Peace talks began in Geneva the next morning. Any negotiating advantage the French government had expected had been lost by Navarre's miscalculations. The First Indochina War was over. Considered responsible for the loss, Navarre was replaced 3 June 1954 by General Paul √âly. He remained in the Army, retiring in 1956. In the same year he published Agonie de l'Indochine, a work which blamed the Indochina defeat on the nature of the French political system, intellectuals, politicians, journalists, and Communists. The book warned of the possible necessity for an army coup to replace the French Fourth Republic. He died in Paris in 1983.

He was the head coach of the Arizona Wildcats men's team for 25 years. He was also head coach for the Iowa Hawkeyes for nine years and Long Beach State 49ers for one season. Known for player development, many of his former players have gone on to have impressive careers in the NBA. On October 23, 2008, Olson announced his retirement from coaching. Olson died on August 27, 2020, at a hospital in Tucson, Arizona after suffering from a stroke. He was 85 years old. Biography=Early life Lute Olson was born on a farm outside Mayville, North Dakota on September 22, 1934 and is of Norwegian-American parentage. In 1939, Olson's father, Albert died of a stroke at age 47. There are memories of Albert giving his children haircuts that morning before church before collapsing. Lute's mother, Alinda, said Albert was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù returning from WWI, some believed he may have been exposed to poison gas while working in a military construction battalion. Just a few months later, Olson's older brother Amos, who had returned from Mayville State College to run the family farm, died in a tractor accident on the farm. This forced Alinda Olson to move away from the farm and into Mayville. There, Olson attended his first three years at Mayville High School, before eventually graduating from Grand Forks Central High School after the family moved again. Olson was coached by Harold Poier at Mayville, where he grew to 6' 3\\" (1.90 m) as a junior. At Grand Forks, Olson played in his senior year for Coach Fritz Engel in both summer American Legion baseball and basketball, playing football for Coaches Bob Peskey and Louis King. In 1951, the family had moved to Grand Forks, where Lute's older sister Kathleen had moved to study nursing. It was there, while singing in the church choir, that Lute first met Bobbi Russell. The pair became inseparable. In 1951‚Äì52, Olson led Grand Forks Central to the 1952 state basketball championship, playing center. Central beat Williston 43‚Äì38 for the title, as Olson scored 16 points. Earlier in the 1952 state tournament, Olson's Central team had defeated Minot St. Leo's, featuring future Louisiana State University coach Dale Brown. Olson enrolled at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota after completing high school. There, he played football, basketball and one year of baseball. Olson graduated in 1956 with double major in history and physical education and Olson was awarded the \\"Augsburg Honors Athlete Award,\\" given annually to the top Augsburg male student-athlete. While at Augsburg, he and Bobbi were married on Thanksgiving, 1953. Reminiscing about winters in Minnesota, Olson said \\"Growing up, it was fine because I didn't know any better,\\" Olson said. \\"People from North Dakota go south to Minneapolis for the winter.\\" After graduating from Augsburg, Olson taught and coached high school basketball for 13 years. First in Minnesota at Mahnomen and Two Harbors, Minnesota for five years total. In 1961, Olson and Bobbi moved west, first to Boulder, Colorado, where Olson was a middle school guidance counselor. Then they moved to California where, in 1962‚Äì1963, Olson coached the freshman basketball team at Western High School in Anaheim. In 1963 Olson became the varsity coach at Loara High School, also in Anaheim. In 1964 he was hired as varsity head coach at Marina-Huntington Beach High School. Head coaching career=Long Beach City College (1969‚Äì1973) In summer, 1969 Olson became Head Coach at Long Beach City College. Olson took the position after desiring to coach in college and seizing the opportunity when Coach Rex Hughes left LBCC for the University of Nebraska. Olson was 35 years old with 5 children when making the career change from high school to college. As a high school teacher, Olson mentioned he had tired of mundane items such as hall monitoring and checking restrooms for smokers. Olson had also been working side jobs working for Wright Driving School and driving a gas truck for Texaco. Olson later said to the media of his move to LBCC, ‚ÄúI wanted a college job and at 35 I felt I couldn't wait much longer.‚Äù Olson proved to be an immediate success at the college level, leading his Long Beach City College teams to a 103-22 record over four seasons and capturing the 1971 JC Championship. Of his tenure at Long Beach City College, Olson said, ‚ÄúI was perfectly content there, and had no plans to go anyplace, I loved it there. Del Walker, a great guy, was the athletic director, and I recall his telling me when he hired me that he wanted me to recruit players strictly from the Long Beach area, which I did.\\" His success was noticed in Long Beach, leading to an opportunity to enter the NCAA coaching ranks in 1973.  Long Beach State University (1973‚Äì1974)  In Olson's one season at Long Beach State, he led the team to an undefeated conference record, a Big West championship and a 24-2 record. The only two losses were two-point losses at Colorado and at #6 Marquette University. Olson had been content to stay at LBCC, but was pursued by LBSU. ‚ÄúI wasn't that interested because there were rumors that Long Beach was about to go on NCAA probation,‚Äù Olson said. ‚ÄúI told them I'd need about 10 days to think about it. They told me during that time that Long Beach wasn't going to go on probation. I believed them, but they didn't tell me the truth.‚Äù Olson followed Jerry Tarkanian as coach, and Tarkanian had built the program into a National power, before leaving for the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Under Olson, the 49ers were ranked as high as #3 behind Coach John Wooden and player Bill Walton's UCLA squad and eventual NCAA Tournament Champion North Carolina State. However, with a #10 regular season ranking, the team was banned from appearing in the NCAA tournament after being put on a 3-year probation mid-season, due to recruiting violations from the Tarkanian era. Five players 49ers players from that season were drafted into the NBA. Drafted were: Cliff Poindexter (Chicago), his brother Roscoe Poindexter (Boston), All- American Glenn McDonald (1st Round, Boston), Leonard Grey (Seattle) and a year later, Bobby Gross (Portland). The 24-2 mark still stands as the school's best season winning percentage. After one season at Long Beach State, Olson accepted the head coaching position at the University of Iowa. University of Iowa (1974‚Äì1983) Olson left Long Beach for the University of Iowa and later remarked, \\"People didn't go from Long Beach to Iowa, they went from Iowa to Long Beach,\\" Olson said. \\"I thought, 'well, I'm just going to break that trend.' I saw an opportunity.\\"‚ÄúI also liked it at Long Beach State, but I felt I had been lied to and decided to leave even though Iowa wasn't exactly a basketball hotbed,‚Äù he said. Olson coached Iowa for nine seasons, from 1974 to 1983, with an overall record of 167‚Äì91 (.647), leaving as the schools all-time wins leader. Olson inherited an Iowa team that had gone 8-16 under Dick Schultz, finishing 10th in the Big Ten and suffered four consecutive losing seasons. Olson turned the Iowa Basketball program around, going 19-10 in just his second season. Iowa then won the Big Ten Conference Title in 1978‚Äì79, earning the first of five consecutive NCAA Tournament berths. In 1979-1980, Olson led the Hawkeyes to a Final Four appearance in the 1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The team made the now 48-team NCAA tournament with an 18‚Äì8 record (10-8, 4th in the Big Ten), despite playing a good portion of the season without injured (knee) All-American guard Ronnie Lester. With Lester out, Guard Kenny Arnold had stayed in the line-up and played the entire season with a broken right thumb, leading the team in total points and assists with the injury. Freshman Bobby Hansen played after breaking a bone in his left hand and fellow freshman Mark Gannon was lost for the season with a knee injury. Iowa was also without Assistant Coach Tony McAndrews, who had been in a plane crash mid-season after a recruiting trip. He survived, but was badly injured and did not return to coaching that season. Lester returned for end of the regular season and the tournament. In the NCAA, Iowa received a #5 seed in the East Regional. They beat Virginia Commonwealth (86-72), North Carolina State (77-64) and #1 seed Syracuse (88‚Äì77). In the East Regional Final, Iowa was down by as many in 14 in the second half, before rallying to defeat Georgetown (81-80) on a last second basket and free-throw by Steve Waite to advance to the Final Four. In the NCAA Semi-Final, Lester injured his knee early in the game, after scoring 10 of Iowa's first 12 points. He did not return and Iowa fell to eventual NCAA champion Louisville 80-72. When Olson was asked years later about Iowa's chances to win the NCAA Tournament had Lester not been injured, \\"My feeling was yes, I feel we could have won,\\" Olson said. \\"That was a fun team to coach.\\" Overall, Iowa was 15‚Äì1 with Lester fully in the lineup and 8-9 in his absence. After leading the Hawkeyes to the Final Four, Olson's Iowa teams made the next three NCAA Tournaments, advancing to the Sweet Sixteen in 1983, his final season at Iowa. Nicknamed \\"The House That Lute Built\\", Carver-Hawkeye Arena, a facility Olson had envisioned for the future of the University, opened on January 5, 1983 against Michigan State. Iowa had played in the antiquated Iowa Fieldhouse. After the season, Olson left Iowa for the University of Arizona. University of Arizona (1983‚Äì2007) Olson surprised many by leaving Iowa for an Arizona program that had just suffered the worst season in school history, having won only four games all season and one game in Pac-10 play. He said he left Iowa because life there had become a \\"fishbowl\\" and he needed a change. Under Olson, Arizona quickly rose to national prominence. In only his second year, the Wildcats notched their first winning season in six years and made the first of what would be 23 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances under his watch. A year later, Arizona won its first Pac-10 title. Two years later, the Wildcats spent much of the season ranked #1 and made their first (and Olson's second) Final Four. Olson's subsequent Arizona teams would be fixtures in the Top 25 for most of the time until the mid-2000s. Olson was voted Pac-10 Coach of the Year seven times, made 5 Final Four appearances and won the 1997 NCAA championship with Arizona, where his team accomplished the feat of defeating three #1 seeds in the same tournament. In 2002, Olson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. He also coached the US national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, the last U.S. amateur basketball team to win in international competition. His team defeated the U.S.S.R. 87-85 in the gold medal game, the first time the U.S. had won the world championship in 32 years.1986 USA Basketball =Players developed at Arizona= Throughout the nineties and 2000s, Arizona under Olson was one of the top producers of NBA talent in terms of number of alumni playing in the league. Many of these players (such as Steve Kerr, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, and Gilbert Arenas) were not highly regarded on a national level in high school but flourished under Olson's system to eventually become college stars and productive NBA players. The basketball program at Arizona has been dubbed \\"Point Guard U\\" because of the numerous players who have excelled at that position, including Steve Kerr, Damon Stoudamire, Mike Bibby, and Jason Terry (additionally, point guards Reggie Geary and Matt Othick both played briefly in the NBA and Kenny Lofton went on to become an All-Star center fielder in Major League Baseball). All- American Jason Gardner (graduated in 2003), had been the only starting Arizona point guards to not have played any NBA minutes since before Steve Kerr in 1984, prior to Mustafa Shakur and Chris Rodgers in recent years. Despite this reputation, Arizona under Olson has also developed many outstanding shooting guards and swingmen: Sean Elliott, Gilbert Arenas, Jud Buechler, Khalid Reeves, Miles Simon, Michael Dickerson, Chris Mills, Richard Jefferson, Luke Walton, Andre Iguodala, Salim Stoudamire, Michael Wright, Ray Owes and Hassan Adams all excelled with the Wildcats, and many went on to stardom in the NBA. Fewer Arizona big men have made such a big impact in the NBA, but Olson has coached several notables: forward Tom Tolbert and centers Brian Williams (later renamed Bison Dele), Sean Rooks, Loren Woods, and Channing Frye have also made careers in the NBA. Family Olson married Roberta \\"Bobbi\\" Russell in 1953. They were married for 47 years and had five children. Bobbi Olson died on January 1, 2001, of ovarian cancer, aged 65. The basketball court at UA is named the Lute and Bobbi Olson Court in her honor. In 2003, Olson married Christine Jack Toretti. On December 6, 2007, Olson filed for divorce from his second wife, Christine. Olson married Kelly Fischer in April, 2010. On March 15, 2005, Olson's granddaughter, Julie Brase, was named an assistant coach of the Phoenix Mercury in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Brase played for the women's basketball team at the University of Arizona as a starting player for four years and had served as an assistant coach at Loyola Marymount University. She also worked as an assistant coach at Olson's basketball camps. His daughter, Jody (Julie's mother), is currently principal at Catalina Foothills High School In 2018, Julie (Brase) Hairgrove, longtime assistant coach with Phoenix, was selected to be an assistant coach in lhe WNBA All-Star game. Olson's grandson Matt Brase was a member of the University of Arizona basketball team from 2003 to 2005 and then worked as an administrative assistant and video coordinator. In early November 2008, Matt was promoted to assistant coach by then-interim coach Russ Pennell.Olson's grandson hired by Wildcats - Sports In 2018, Matt Brase joined the staff of the Houston Rockets as an Assistant Coach after having served as Head Coach of the Rockets' developmental league team and being with the Rockets organization since 2013. Health issues= Controversies and absences  Olson's behavior became erratic in 2007, beginning with the dismissal of 27-year associate head coach Jim Rosborough in April 2007. It is widely believed that Olson had promised Rosborough the head coach position when Olson retired. Olson replaced Rosborough with former Toronto Raptors head coach Kevin O'Neill. On November 4, 2007, Olson was absent from the Wildcats' preseason opener. It was announced 10 minutes prior to the game that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence. At the time, the university said such absence was not health related. O'Neill took over head-coaching duties during the leave of absence.Olson takes leave of absence - News On December 6, 2007, it was announced that Olson would miss the entire 2007-08 season. The following day, it was announced that Olson had filed for divorce from his wife of four years, Christine. On December 18, Arizona announced that Olson planned to return for the 2008-09 season, and also named O'Neill as Olson's designated successor upon his retirement. Kevin O'Neill publicly stated that he was still relying on a promise to be Lute Olson's successor, and that he would return to UA to be an assistant for the 2008‚Äì09 season. However, during an April 2008 press conference in which he appeared visibly annoyed and defensive with reporters, Olson announced that O'Neill would never coach at the University of Arizona again. This marked the second time in a year that Olson had reneged on a promise to promote an assistant coach, following his dismissal of Jim Rosborough. O'Neill later accepted an assistant coaching position with the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA, and was subsequently the head coach at USC. Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood also said assistant and former Wildcat guard Miles Simon (a key player on Olson's 1997 national championship team) would no longer coach.  Retirement from coaching  Olson met with the Tucson media during Arizona's annual preseason media day on October 21; in contrast to his April appearance, he seemed in relatively upbeat and positive spirits and ready to coach in 2008. However, Olson did not attend the October 22 practice, which was run by associate head coach Mike Dunlap, and missed a Rotary Club function in Tucson which he attended annually for many years (former Wildcat point guard Reggie Geary, by now a member of the coaching staff, attended the event on Olson's behalf). After a day of speculation fueled by initial reports by Dick Vitale of ESPN, Livengood formally announced Olson's retirement afternoon of October 23. Livengood would not speculate on Olson's permanent replacement; it was widely assumed Dunlap would coach the team on an interim basis. The interim coach was announced by Livengood on October 24 to be Russ Pennell, who joined the Wildcat staff in May 2008. On October 28, 2008, five days after Olson announced his retirement, Olson's personal physician, Steven D. Knope, held a press conference in Tucson alongside Olson's daughters and grandson, in which he showed signs of emotion at times; Olson himself was not in attendance. Knope, who in March had cleared Olson medically to return to coaching after his leave of absence, announced that the coach had an \\"initially undiagnosed\\" stroke earlier in the year (confirmed by an MRI scan taken on October 27) which had caused severe depression and impaired judgment. Olson had also apparently suffered from atrial fibrillation for several years, which could have produced a blood clot resulting in the stroke. Knope became concerned about \\"changes in (Olson's) behavior and trouble handling his increasing workload\\" and advised Olson to retire as a result: :: \\"I believe some of those personality changes were out of character,\\" Knope said. \\"I had very little contact with him this summer. I saw his (April 1) press conference and noticed that he was a little out of character...What I'm truly hoping for now is that the team and community rally around this now that they understand...I hope everyone remembers what he's done for the community.\\" Knope said that Olson was \\"devastated\\" upon being informed of the MRI results and remained at home in Tucson; Olson has so far declined to comment publicly on his condition. Knope further clarified his position for the Arizona Daily Star a few days later: :: \\"During his initial bout of depression in November 2007, Olson responded appropriately to medications. He had a complete recovery from his depression. He had no unusual behavior at that time and there was no indication for an MRI. The results of an MRI performed at that time would likely have been normal. During Olson's more recent depression, which began approximately six weeks ago, Olson did not respond to therapy. This was a change. The medications were no longer effective. In addition, there were behaviors in recent months which, in retrospect, were uncharacteristic of the man. These were the clues that suggested he may have a rare frontal lobe syndrome, in which behavioral changes, judgmental errors and difficulty with complex tasks became prominent. These symptoms were the red flags that triggered the need for an MRI (which confirmed the stroke)\\". Retirement activities In retirement, Olson has visited the University of Iowa on numerous occasions, calling it \\"a special place\\" to him, having been inducted into the Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame in 2000. Among his visits: on October 26, 2009, Olson and members of the 1980 Final Four team were honored at Iowa's Kinnick Stadium and had a Final Four Weekend Reunion together with their families. On Sept 9, 2015 he visited with players and Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery, attending a football game and holding a brief press conference to talk about his memories. On December 8, 2016 Olson attended the Iowa-Iowa State basketball game at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, alongside his former Iowa player Ronnie Lester. Olson and Lester spoke with the press before the game and told stories. Over time, Olson, Lester, Iowa teammates and fans have contributed to help Kenny Arnold, who was the second leading scorer and assist leader for the Hawkeye Final Four squad in 1980. Arnold was first diagnosed with brain cancer in 1985 and his healthcare needs have continued. At one point, Olson arranged for Arnold to be flown to Arizona so he could be examined and treated at the facilities where Olson's wife Bobbi had once undergone cancer treatment. Teammates Ronnie Lester and Mike \\"Tree\\" Henry accompanied Arnold. The trip was deemed to beneficial to Arnold's health. On April 12, 2018, Olson was honored by the University of Arizona, who erected a statue of him outside the McKale Center on campus. The unveiling was attended my many former Arizona players as well as Olson's family. When the statue was unveiled, Olson remarked, \\"They got the hair right.\\" Olson spoke and answered questions from fans and media, stating \\"This means the world to me.\\" At home in Arizona, Olson recently said he tries to go to all home Arizona basketball games, and travels to road games at California and UCLA. He also attends some NBA games to see his former Arizona players Steve Kerr (Golden State Warriors) and Luke Walton (Sacramento Kings) coach their respective NBA teams. Olson also plays more golf than before, ‚ÄúIf I were lucky I might get in 10 rounds of golf a year when I was coaching,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I play all the time.‚Äù Death Olson was hospitalized in 2019 after suffering a stroke, and was moved into hospice care in August 2020. On August 27, 2020, Olson died at the age of 85. Legacy Olson, circa 1987 Lute Olson is regarded as one of the greatest coaches in the history of college basketball. Along with the successful players noted above, Olson has 46 NCAA tournament wins, one behind John Wooden and one ahead of Bob Knight. His Wildcat basketball teams were wildly popular in Tucson, among university students as well as the general public; Olson brought a renewed sense of prestige to both the University of Iowa and University of Arizona at a time when both of their sports programs were mediocre. In November 2007, Olson teamed with publisher Mascot Books to release a children's book featuring the Arizona mascot touring the campus, entitled Hello, Wilbur!. Upon his retirement, accolades came in from several sources. Robert Shelton, University of Arizona president, said, \\"Lute Olson transformed the UA and Tucson into premier basketball country...Arizona now stands in the company of great college basketball programs, and we have Lute to thank for that. We will sorely miss his brilliance as our head coach, but we will benefit from the legacy he leaves for decades to come.\\"Official University of Arizona announcement of the retirement of Lute Olson Kevin O'Neill, the man originally tapped to replace Olson as Arizona head coach, but who later left the Wildcat program, stated: \\"I have great respect for Lute Olson. He is one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time...His legacy will (be) the standard at the University of Arizona for as long as they have basketball. I appreciate every opportunity he gave me.\\" \\"He's been involved in the game and been a great ambassador for college basketball for a long time,\\" former University of Florida head basketball coach Billy Donovan said. \\"There's no question he went through a difficult time and I don't know all that went on. He took over Arizona at rock bottom and built it into an incredible program...For him, maybe dealing with health issues and family issues, for whatever reason, it's not right for him to continue on. And I just hope he's at peace with where he's at in his decision.\\" Greg Hansen, columnist and longtime Olson critic for the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, had this to say: \\"Until now, Lute Olson has been judged by games won and banners hung, but it is the passage of time that will be his greatest test. Ultimately, it won't matter that he didn't beat Purdue in the last game he ever coached, that his final recruiting class went bust or that he abandoned his school twice at the worst possible time. As the games fade away, the future will paint a flattering portrait of him...Across the last quarter-century, Olson made our city feel good about itself. He made us feel like winners. Who else has done that? He changed the way we looked at ourselves.\\" On February 11, 2012, Lute Olson was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity by Gamma Delta Chapter at the University of Arizona. He was chosen as a special initiate due to his loyalty to the University of Arizona and his dedication he showed to his players. Olson is the namesake of The Lute Olson Award. Beginning in 2010, The Lute Olson Award is presented annually to the nation's top Division I player in College Basketball and is selected by a 30-member committee. The recipient is announced annually at the site on NCAA Final Four. Recipients are selected off a preseason watchlist that is narrowed to finalists in March. Lute would again be re-inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame with the 2019 class.

The Cooper River is a mainly tidal river in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The cities of Mt. Pleasant, Charleston, North Charleston, Goose Creek, Moncks Corner, and Hanahan are located along the river. Short and wide, the river is joined first by the blackwater East Branch and then farther downstream at the tidal Wando River. Almost immediately thereafter, the Cooper River widens into its estuary and unites with the Ashley River to form the Charleston Harbor. Long used as an important commercial waterway, the West Branch of the Cooper River was initially connected to the Santee River near its navigation head by the Santee Canal, built in the late 18th century. Though the West Branch still rises as a blackwater swamp in central Berkeley County, its main headwaters have been seamlessly shifted to Lake Moultrie by the 1940s vintage Tail Race Canal. Lake Moultrie is, in turn, fed from Lake Marion by a diversion canal built around the same time period. This artificial rerouting of the Cooper River basin has essentially unified the Santee and Cooper River systems into a single hydrological drainage entity. The river was named for Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony. Charleston was founded on the western bank of the Ashley River in 1670 (at Charles Towne Landing), before moving across to its current peninsular location ten years later. Rice and indigo were heavily cultivated on plantations surrounding the brackish marshland of the Cooper River from the early Colonial through the end of the Civil War periods. Former plantations along the river include Lewisfield, Mulberry, Middleburg, Quinby and Mepkin, which is now Mepkin Abbey, a Trappist monastery. Many of these and other structures form the Cooper River Historic District, a national historic district located along both branches of the river. In addition to the Mepkin Abbey Botanical Garden, nearby attractions include the Cypress Gardens and the Old Santee Canal Park. Daniel Island and Drum Island (uninhabited) are adjacent to the river. Cargo terminals, a paper mill, and the former Charleston Naval Base line its shore. The Patriot's Point naval & maritime museum sits at the mouth of the river. Berthed at Patriot's Point are four museum ships, most notably , a World War II aircraft carrier. Goose Creek, a tributary of the Cooper River was the site of a U.S. Navy submarine base through the late 1990s and functioned as a nuclear weapons handling facility servicing fleet ballistic submarines until the advent of the larger Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile which drove the s to require a deeper draft. Crossings Motorists have been able to cross the Cooper River under their own power for approximately eight decades, when it was first spanned by the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge. As the Grace Bridge quickly became both functionally and structurally deficient, the State of South Carolina built a parallel span, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge, a few yards (meters) to the south in 1966. These highly overstressed spans were, for over a quarter of a century, the only connection between Charleston and the rapidly growing suburb of Mt. Pleasant until the Don Holt Bridge, built a few miles upriver as part of the I-526 corridor, became the third bridge to span the river in 1992. In service since August 8, 1929, the Grace Memorial Bridge was the oldest of the three. Named for the commissioner who inspired the state's highway system, the Pearman Bridge opened on April 29, 1966. Their replacement span, the cable- stayed Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge (or \\"New Cooper River Bridge\\") opened to traffic on July 16, 2005. Demolition of the Grace and Pearman bridges began shortly afterwards and was completed in late 2007. A very popular 10k run over the river occurs each spring, the Cooper River Bridge Run. Though both bridges are modern in every respect, the Holt and Ravenel bridges are only two bridges to carry motor vehicular traffic across the river, although the Dennis C. Bishop Bridge carries US 52-US 17 Alternate traffic across the Tail Race canal just below the Pinopolis Dam on Lake Moultrie. A CSX railroad trestle bridge traverses the upper reaches of the West Branch, below the Pinopolis DamCharleston to Columbia Navigation map at SanteeCooper.com. Retrieved 20 May 2020.

More recently, Robert Philip wrote that \\"each and every Krishnan rally was a thing of rare beauty\\". According to veteran sports journalist C.V. Narsimhan, \\"His service was never a powerful weapon, he did not have any powerful groundstrokes either. He won with consistency, angled volleys, and a graceful half volley drop shot now and then\\". Rafael Osuna, Nicola Pietrangeli and Krishnan's son Ramesh were some of the other notable exponents of this style emphasizing finesse. Awards Krishnan received the Arjuna award in 1961, the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Padma Bhushan in 1967. Book Krishnan has written, with his son Ramesh Krishnan and Nirmal Shekar, a book titled A touch of tennis: The story of a tennis family. The book covering the achievements of three generations of tennis-playing Krishnans, was released by Penguin Books India. Current Krishnan now lives in Chennai, where he manages a gas distribution agency. Ramesh Krishnan emulated his father's achievement of winning the Wimbledon junior title, and went on to become a leading Indian tennis player in the 1980s. On 25 July 2012, Ramanathan Krishnan re-launched India's premier English-language weekly sports magazine, Sportstar, at a function in Chennai. Krishnan runs a tennis training center in Chennai together with his son.

Founded in 1963, it is the third-oldest of the twelve community colleges governed by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system (CSCU) and has graduated more than 23,000 students since the first class in 1965. MCC is the largest of the state's community colleges, serving more than 15,000 students a year, with nearly 6,000 undergraduate students in credit programs, and more than 7,000 credit-free and 2,000 credit extension students each year. It has an annual budget of more than $31 million. In 1996, MCC was named an \\"Honor Institution\\" by the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation due to its \\"remarkable history of nurturing and encouraging students' academic and intellectual abilities and motivation.\\" The college remains the only American community college to have been recognized as such. MCC is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Service area MCC has the largest service area of the Connecticut community colleges, being the primary community college for the towns of Andover, Bolton, Columbia, Coventry, East Hartford,Ellington, Glastonbury, Hebron, Mansfield, Marlborough, Rockville, South Windsor, Stafford, Storrs, Tolland, Union, Vernon, and Willington, in addition to Manchester. However, only 56% of the credit student population hails from the primary service area. There are multiple reasons for this, including the college's reputation in specialized programs such as the culinary arts and criminal justice; cross-registration from students attending other colleges, such as the University of Hartford, University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford and Central Connecticut State University in New Britain; and the fact that the Town of Manchester borders Tolland County, the only county in Connecticut not to have a community college of its own. Campus The MCC campus is situated on in the southwest corner of Manchester, near the town lines with East Hartford and Glastonbury as well as I-384. The campus is mostly undeveloped, with large wooded areas and open land spaces. The main buildings are the Learning Resource Center; the Arts, Sciences and Technologies Center; and the Frederick Lowe Building, which is the oldest building on the campus, having been dedicated in 1986. There are also six smaller single-classroom buildings located in the center of the college's courtyard, collectively known as \\"The Village,\\" which house some of the specialized programs, including manufacturing technology and the musical arts. Special facilities include PC and Macintosh computer labs, a library, a television studio, the SBM Charitable Foundation Auditorium, science and allied health labs, the Hans Weiss Newspace Gallery and fine art studios, and numerous study spaces. An outdoor bandshell hosts concerts and special events periodically throughout the year, including commencement in May. For fitness and athletics, MCC has baseball, softball, and soccer fields. The Town of Manchester walking trails also pass through the campus, connecting it to the East Coast Greenway. The campus also features a large pond behind the bandshell, which is frequented by the early childhood education program as a sample field trip site. The East Campus was a group of temporary classroom buildings and faculty offices as well as other facilities that were dedicated in 1971. These single-story modular buildings were intended to be temporary and were said to have a lifespan of approximately 10 years. However, they remained in use for 31 years, until the Learning Resource Center and Arts, Sciences and Technologies Center opened in fall 2002. As of fall 2008, the East Campus buildings have been demolished and the area is undergoing redevelopment. The AST building rotunda. Academic programs MCC offers associate in art and associate in science degrees in more than 40 disciplines. Academic majors include accounting, business, business office technology, computer information systems, computer science and technology, engineering science and industrial technology, general studies, health careers, hospitality management, human services, humanities, and the liberal arts and sciences. Special programs in areas such as women's studies, African-American studies, environmental studies, and journalism are also available. The college also offers programs of a shorter duration in each of the areas listed above, resulting in the awarding of a certificate. The certificate programs range from 12 to 30 credits, and some may be completed in as little as one year. The college also hosts various seminars, workshops, exhibitions, and guest speakers each year. Student support services The Center for Student Development offers support services for students with disabilities and those needing additional academic help, including counseling, advising, tutoring, transitional programs, and services for international and minority students. In addition to traditional tutoring, the Writing Center serves as a place where students can receive drop-in assistance with essay development and structure. The MCC Career Services and Cooperative Education department provides employment guidance and resources for students, including for the internship program. Specialized services are available for veterans and women, as well as people with disabilities. Additional offerings include the Child Development Center, Tech-Prep programs, and Excursions in Learning programs for youth and families. Honors program Since 1992, MCC has also offered a highly active honors program for students pursuing a more challenging curriculum. The honors program allows students to conduct specialized research, pursue topics of personal interest, write papers to be submitted for publication, and otherwise engage in activities not typically undertaken by MCC students. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.4/4.0 must be maintained to remain in the program. Students in the honors program can take special honors courses in fields such as literature, political science, foreign language, mathematics, and the physical sciences. They receive special notation on their transcripts, in addition to any Latin or semester honors for which they may be eligible. Continuing education Through its Continuing Education division, MCC also offers a wide variety of programs throughout the year, including regular credit programs during the summer aimed at working adults. Credits earned through the Continuing Education can be applied to an MCC degree or certificate. Credit-free programs are also offered by the division during the spring, summer, fall, and winter periods. These are courses of general interest to the local population, typically on topics related to personal development, culture, and hobbies such as gardening and photography. Most credit-free courses meet between four and six times and do not involve the same academic requirements as credit courses. The Continuing Education division also offers credit-free certificates, including Certified Nurse-Aide, Complete Microsoft Office, Emergency Medical Technician, Oracle Database Administrator, Precision Machining, and Principles and Practices of Real Estate certification. Transferring MCC students have successfully transferred to more than 100 public and private universities, both in Connecticut and throughout the country. MCC has joint programs with both the University of Connecticut and Eastern Connecticut State University that provide students with guaranteed admission to either university and dual academic counseling while pursuing their associate degree. MCC was the first Connecticut community college to have an articulation agreement with UConn's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. All students graduating with a 2.0/4.0 GPA or higher can attend any of the Connecticut State University System institutions. Recent transfers have been accepted to colleges and universities as noted as Wellesley College, Cornell University, Yale University, Washington University in Saint Louis, Smith College, Trinity College, Amherst College, Goucher College, Williams College, American University, Brown University, Wesleyan University, New York University, Columbia University, Johnson & Wales University, Mount Holyoke College, the University of Virginia, and Howard University. Amherst has set up an active transfer guidance program with MCC faculty that uses regular communication and on-site visits to encourage more students to apply, while institutions like Smith, Cornell, and Mount Holyoke regularly recruit on campus. Campus life There are students from more than 70 countries attending MCC, with about 50 languages being spoken among them. In fall 2007, 52% of the student body was 21 years of age or younger. MCC has hosted a variety of special events and programs in recent years, including performances by artists such as Chris Botti, Katz, and Peterson Toscano; major campaign appearances by Ned Lamont and John Larson; lectures by Scott Ritter, Bernie Siegel, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and Ralph Nader; and a visiting professorship by E. R. Braithwaite. Cocurricular activities MCC has the largest student activities budget within the Connecticut Community Colleges and also receives separate institutional funding for its athletics teams. All registered student organizations operate under the supervision of the Manchester Community College Student Senate, the college's student government association, which provides each active organization with an annual budget of up to $800, not including additional travel and event special funding opportunities. The college has more than 35 student clubs and organizations, including business and pre-professional clubs, social groups, and cultural organizations. The college's student newspaper, the Live Wire, has received several awards from the Associated Collegiate Press at its national conventions during the paper's history, while the college's student-run Internet radio station, ICE Internet Radio, has been broadcasting since 2007. The college is also home to the Computer Repair and Share Club, offering computer repair to the students and staff at no charge. The college is also home to the Manchester Community College Alumni Association, the Manchester Community College Foundation, and the Manchester Community College Organization of Active Adults (formerly the Older Adult Association). Honor societies MCC has chapters of several honor societies, with the college's chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the two-year equivalent of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, being the largest and most active. Other notable honor societies with chapters at the college include Alpha Mu Gamma, a national foreign language honor society; Alpha Beta Gamma, a national business honor society; and Epsilon Pi Tau, an international honor society for technology students. In addition to holding induction ceremonies at least once a yer, most of the honor societies at Manchester Community College also hold regular events, fundraisers, and other forms of programming, both on and off campus. Athletics The only Connecticut community college with an intercollegiate athletics program, MCC hosts four sports teams - soccer and basketball for women, and soccer and for men. The men's soccer team and women's basketball teams are particularly noted, frequently appearing in the top ten of the national rankings. In addition, the baseball team advanced to the NJCAA World Series in 1994, 2008, and 2009. All teams, known as the Cougars, competed in Region XXI of Division III of the National Junior College Athletic Association. In February 2013, it was announced that Manchester Community College would be ending its athletic program due to budget restrictions. The Fitness Center, open to all students, faculty, and staff, offers aerobics and weight-training facilities. Specialized courses in areas such as kickboxing, pilates, and fencing are also available. Community programs Although most cocurricular events are restricted to enrolled credit students, many other programs are available to the Greater Manchester community as a whole. The MCC International Film Series showcases one foreign film per month in the SBM Charitable Foundation Auditorium; there is no admission charge. Special lectures offered by campus-based groups and organizations that include the Institute of Local History, part of the History Department, and the Association on Community & Inclusion, a disability rights organization, welcome interested learners from throughout the community to attend. The Manchester campus is also frequently used by outside organizations for special events, including charity walks, club and civic organization meetings, political events, and press conferences and special information sessions conducted by other state organizations. Great Path Academy MCC is home to Great Path Academy, a middle college high school housed at the college that has an enrollment of more than 100 students. Great Path (or GPA) is a collaborative effort between Manchester Community College, the Connecticut Community-Technical Colleges, and the Capitol Region Education Council. Students at Great Path complete their high school courses at the college and are also able to take regular MCC courses for credit. Upon graduation from Great Path, the average GPA student has already earned 30 college credits, which they can then transfer to another institution or apply towards an MCC degree. Manchester began construction during the 2007-2008 academic year for a new wing for Great Path, which is expected to eventually increase enrollment to about 300 students. Opened in June 2009, the new Great Path wing, named for the college's president emeritus Jonathan M. Daube, added additional classroom and student space. It also houses a gymnasium that will serve as the home court for the college's women's basketball team.

A muscular hydrostat is a biological structure found in animals. It is used to manipulate items (including food) or to move its host about and consists mainly of muscles with no skeletal support. It performs its hydraulic movement without fluid in a separate compartment, as in a hydrostatic skeleton. A muscular hydrostat, like a hydrostatic skeleton, relies on the fact that water is effectively incompressible at physiological pressures. In contrast to a hydrostatic skeleton, where muscle surrounds a fluid-filled cavity, a muscular hydrostat is composed mainly of muscle tissue. Since muscle tissue itself is mainly made of water and is also effectively incompressible, similar principles apply. Muscular anatomy Closeup of the trunk of an Asian elephant Muscles provide the force to move a muscular hydrostat. Since muscles are only able to produce force by contracting and becoming shorter, different groups of muscles have to work against each other, with one group relaxing and lengthening as the other group provides the force by contracting. Such complementary muscle groups are termed antagonist muscles. The muscle fibers in a muscular hydrostat are oriented in three directions: parallel to the long axis, perpendicular to the long axis, and wrapped obliquely around the long axis. The muscles parallel to the long axis are arranged in longitudinal bundles. The more peripherally these are located, the more elaborate bending movements are possible. A more peripheral distribution is found in mammalian tongues, octopus arms, nautilus tentacles, and elephant proboscides. Tongues that are adapted for protrusion typically have centrally located longitudinal fibers. These are found in snake tongues, many lizard tongues, and the mammalian anteaters. The muscles perpendicular to the long axis may be arranged in a transverse, circular, or radial pattern. A transverse arrangement involves sheets of muscle fibers running perpendicular to the long axis, usually alternating between horizontal and vertical orientations. This arrangement is found in the arms and tentacles of squid, octopuses, and in most mammalian tongues. A radial arrangement involves fibers radiating out in all directions from the center of the organ. This is found in the tentacles of the chambered nautilus and in the elephant proboscis (trunk). A circular arrangement has rings of contractive fibers around the long axis. This is found in many mammalian and lizard tongues along with squid tentacles. Helical or oblique fibers around the long axis are generally present in two layers with opposite chirality and wrap around the central core of musculature. Mechanism of operation In a muscular hydrostat, the musculature itself both creates movement and provides skeletal support for that movement. It can provide this support because it is composed primarily of an incompressible ‚Äúliquid\\" and is thus constant in volume. The most important biomechanical feature of a muscular hydrostat is its constant volume. Muscle is composed primarily of an aqueous liquid that is essentially incompressible at physiological pressures. In a muscular hydrostat or any other structure of constant volume, a decrease in one dimension will cause a compensatory increase in at least one other dimension. The mechanisms of elongation, bending and torsion in muscular hydrostats all depend on constancy of volume to effect shape changes in the absence of stiff skeletal attachments.Wainwright, P. C.; Bennett, A. F. (1992). \\"The mechanism of tongue projection in chameleons: II. Role of shape change in a muscular hydrostat\\". The Journal of Experimental Biology 168: 23‚Äì40. Since muscular hydrostats are under constant volume when the diameter increases or decreases, the length must also decrease or increase, respectively. When looking at a cylinder the volume is: V=œÄr¬≤l. When the radius is differentiated with respect to the length: dr/dl=-r/(2l). From this, if a diameter decreases by 25%, the length will increase by approximately 80% which may produce a large amount of force depending on what the animal is trying to do. Alexander, R. McN. (2003). Principles of Animal Locomotion. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Elongation and shortening Arms and tentacles of the squid Abralia veranyi Elongation in hydrostats is caused by the contraction of transverse or helical musculature arrangements. Given the constant volume of muscular hydrostats, these contractions cause an elongation of the longitudinal muscles. Change in length is proportional to the square of the decrease in diameter. Therefore, contractions of muscles perpendicular to the long axis will cause a decrease in diameter and while keeping a constant volume will elongate the organ length-wise. Shortening, on the other hand, can be caused by contraction of the muscles parallel to the long axis resulting in the organ increasing in diameter as well as shortening in length. The muscles used in elongation and shortening maintain support through the constant volume principle and their antagonistic relationships with each other. These mechanisms are seen often in prey capture of shovelnose frogs and chameleons, as well as in the human tongue and many other examples. In some frogs, the tongue elongates up to 180% of its resting length.Nishikawa, K. C.; Kier, W. M.; Smith, K. K. (1999). \\"Morphology and mechanics of tongue movement in the African pig-nosed frog Hemisus marmoratum: a muscular hydrostatic model http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/7/771.short\\". The Journal of Experimental Biology 202: 771‚Äì780. Extra-oral tongues show higher length/width ratios than intra-oral tongues, allowing for a greater increase in length (more than 100% of resting length, as compared to intra-oral tongues at only about 50% of resting length increase). Greater elongation lengths trade off with the force produced by the organ; as the length/width ratio is increased elongation increases while force is decreased. Squids have been shown to use muscular hydrostat elongation in prey capture and feeding as well. Bending The bending of a muscular hydrostat can occur in two ways, both of which require the use of antagonistic muscles. The unilateral contraction of a longitudinal muscle will produce little or no bending and will serve to increase the diameter of the muscular hydrostat because of the constant volume principle that must be met. To bend the hydrostat structure, the unilateral contraction of longitudinal muscle must be accompanied by contractile activity of transverse, radial, or circular muscles to maintain a constant diameter. Bending of a muscular hydrostat can also occur by the contraction of transverse, radial, or circular muscles which decreases the diameter. Bending is produced by longitudinal muscle activity which maintains a constant length on one side of the structure. The bending of a muscular hydrostat is particularly important in animal tongues. This motion provides the mechanism by which a snake flicks the air with its tongue to sense its surroundings, and it is also responsible for the complexities of human speech. Stiffening The stiffening of a muscular hydrostat is accomplished by the muscle or connective tissue of the hydrostat resisting dimensional changes. Torsion Torsion is the twisting of a muscular hydrostat along its long axis and is produced by a helical or oblique arrangement of musculature which have varying direction. For a counter-clockwise torsion it is necessary for a right-hand helix to contract. Contraction of a left-hand helix causes clockwise torsion. The simultaneous contraction of both right and left-hand helixes results in an increase in resistance to torsional forces. The oblique or helical muscle arrays in the muscular hydrostats are located in the periphery of the structure, wrapping the inner core of musculature, and this peripheral location provides a larger moment through which the torque is applied than a more central location. The effect of helically arranged muscle fibers, which may also contribute to changes in length of a muscular hydrostat, depends on fiber angle‚Äîthe angle that the helical muscle fibers make with the long axis of the structure. The length of the helical fiber is at a minimum when the fiber angle equals 54¬∞44‚Ä≤ and is at maximum length when the fiber angle approaches 0¬∞ and 90¬∞. Summed up, this means that helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle greater than 54¬∞44‚Ä≤ will create force for both torsion and elongation while helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle less than 54¬∞44‚Ä≤ will create force for both torsion and shortening.Meyers, J. J.; O'Reilly, J. C.; Monroy, J. A.; Nishikawa, K. C. (2004). \\"Mechanism of tongue protraction in microhylid frogs. The Journal of Experimental Biology 207: 21‚Äì31. The fiber angle of the oblique or helical muscle layers must increase during shortening and decrease during lengthening. In addition to creating a torsional force, the oblique muscle layers will therefore create a force for elongation that may aid the transverse musculature in resisting longitudinal compression.

Early years Cuba (birth name: Gilberto Miguel Calder√≥n Cardona) was born in New York City, Cuba's parents moved from Puerto Rico to New York City in the late 1920s and settled in Spanish Harlem, a Latino community located in Manhattan. Cuba was raised in an apartment building where his father had become the owner of a candy store located on the ground floor (street level floor). His father had organized a stickball club called the Young Devils. Stickball was the main sport activity of the neighborhood. After Cuba broke a leg he took up playing the conga and continued to practice with the conga between school and his free time. Eventually, he graduated from high school and joined a band.Stickball Hall of Fame Musical career In 1950, when he was 19 years old, he played for Joe Panama and also for a group called La Alfarona X. The group soon disbanded and Cuba enrolled in college to study law. While at college he attended a concert in which Tito Puente performed \\"Abaniquito\\". He went up to Tito and introduced himself as a student and fan and soon they developed what was to become a lifetime friendship. This event motivated Cuba to organize his own band. In 1954, his agent recommended that he change the band's name from the Jos√© Calder√≥n Sextet to the Joe Cuba Sextet and the newly named Joe Cuba Sextet made their debut at the Stardust Ballroom. In 1962, after recording three albums for Mardi Gras Records, Cuba recorded his first album with the Joe Cuba Sextet called Steppin' Out featuring the hit 'To Be With You', featuring the impressive vocals of Cheo Feliciano and Jimmy Sabater Sr. The band became popular in the New York Latin community. The lyrics to Cuba's music used a mixture of Spanish and English, becoming an important part of the Nuyorican Movement. In 1965, the Sextet got their first crossover hit with the Latin and soul fusion of \\"El Pito (I'll Never Go Back to Georgia)\\". The \\"I'll Never Go Back to Georgia\\" chant was taken from Dizzy Gillespie's intro to the seminal Afro-Cuban tune \\"Manteca.\\" Sabater later revealed that \\"None of us had ever been to Georgia.\\"Flores, Juan (2000): From Bomba to Hip-Hop: Puerto Rican Culture and Latino Identity, page 87. Columbia University Press, Along with fellow Nuyorican artists such as Ray Barretto and Richie Ray, Cuba was at the forefront of the developing Latin soul sound in New York, merging American R&B; styles with Afro-Cuban instrumentation. Cuba was one of the key architects behind the emerging Latin Boogaloo sound, which became a popular and influential Latin style in the latter half of the 1960s. In 1966, his band scored a hit on the United States National Hit Parade List with the song \\"Bang Bang\\"‚Äî which helped kick off the popularity of the boogaloo. The record peaked at #63 on the Hot 100 and #21 on the R&B; chart. It‚Äôs followup, ‚ÄúOh Yeah‚Äù, peaked at #62 on the Hot 100. https://www.musicvf.com/Joe+Cuba+Sextet.art Later years and death On April 1999, Joe Cuba was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was named Grand Marshal of the Puerto Rican Day Parade celebrated in Yonkers, New York. He was also the director of the Museum of La Salsa, located in Spanish Harlem, Manhattan, New York.Oldies Oldies Joe Cuba died on February 15, 2009 in New York City after being removed from life support. He had been hospitalized for a persistent bacterial infection. Cuba's remains were cremated at Woodhaven Cemetery.Sanchez, Laura N.

It consists of three bronze Tritons holding up a large basin, balanced on a concentric base built out of concrete and clad in travertine slabs. The fountain is one of Malta's most important Modernist landmarks. Designed and constructed between 1952 and 1959 under no less than three governing bodies, and conceived jointly by eminent sculptor Chevalier Vincent Apap and his collaborator draughtsman Victor Anastasi, the fountain became unofficially operational on Saturday 16 May 1959. The fountain was used as a stage for National Celebrations named 'Mill-Maltin gƒßall-Maltin' and is believed to be what contributed to the dramatic collapse of the sculptural group on Wednesday 1 March 1978. The sculptural group was repaired by Malta Drydocks engineers between January 1986 and April 1987. During this intervention a central sculptural addition consisting of three seagulls and seaweed (also the work of Chev. Apap) was introduced within the sculptural group, however this arrangement subsequently diminished the role of the gigantic Tritons‚Äô figures. The fountain deteriorated in subsequent decades, until the bronze figures were dismantled and restored in 2017. Works were ready by the end of the year, and the fountain and piazza were officially inaugurated on 12 January 2018. Design Close-up of the three Tritons The fountain consists of three bronze figures of mythological Tritons holding up a platter. Two of the Tritons are sitting, while the third one is kneeling, and they are balanced on a seaweed base. The face of each Triton is visible when viewed from City Gate. Their posture gives a sense of strength as well as spiral movement, which contribute to the monumentality of the fountain. The water jets were also designed in order to convey the sense of movement. The figures of the Tritons represent Malta's links with the sea, and their design was inspired by the Fontana delle Tartarughe in Rome. After the fountain's platter was damaged in the 1980s, a bronze pillar depicting a flight of seagulls was added to the fountain to support its weight. This will not be included once the current restoration is complete. Kingsgate (pictured in the 1900s), which was demolished in 1964 The base of the fountain was originally designed with a quadripartite plan inspired by Rome's Fontana delle Naiadi, but this was later changed to a tripartite concentric plan. The base is constructed out of reinforced concrete, and it consists of four concentric water basins. The exterior is clad with a total of 730 tons of travertine slabs from Rome. The outer slabs of the vasca intermedia are decorated with a relief representing foliage. Beneath the structure of the fountain, there are a series of passages and chambers which allow for maintenance and inspection and connect the fountain to the water and electrical services. These underground passages and a pump room cover an area of over , and are accessible through a manhole in the pavement near the fountain. The fountain was designed so as to avoid contrast with the nearby bastions, as well as to blend with the Victorian-era Kingsgate. The gate was demolished five years after the fountain was completed. Background and construction View of the fountain showing the reliefs on the travertine base The site of the fountain was formerly occupied by St. Madeleine's Lunette, a 17th-century lunette that protected the entrance to Valletta. The lunette was dismantled and its ditch was filled in with rubble in the 19th century, although some parts might have survived beneath the present street level. The area was eventually used as a bus terminus, and in January 1953 the Ministry for Public Works and Reconstruction launched a competition for designing a fountain in this empty space. The competition was open to everyone except for those who worked at the Public Works Department, and the first prize was of ¬£100. The winning proposal was entitled \\"Triton\\", and it was submitted by the sculptor Vincent Apap. It was designed in collaboration with the draughtsman and designer Victor Anastasi, who was not mentioned on the proposal since he was employed by the PWD. Apap worked on the sculpture of three Tritons in stucco at a former dovecote in Palazzo Parisio, which had been made available by his friend, the marquis Joe Scicluna. Meanwhile, Anastasi worked on the technical and architectural elements of the fountain, including the hydraulic systems, and costs and supplies of materials. Work on the fountain's foundations began in June 1955 by the contractor Carmelo Grech, and construction of the base was complete by mid-1958. The figures of the Tritons were cast in bronze at the Lagana foundry in Naples, and were put in place in 1959. The total cost of construction was around ¬£80,000. The fountain was switched on for the first time on 16 May 1959, but it was never officially inaugurated due to the uneasy political situation at the time, as Malta's government had just resigned and the islands were under direct colonial rule. Damage and repair View of the fountain showing the central pillar, added in 1986 and removed in 2017 In the decades after its construction, the fountain became a landmark due to its prominent location in Malta's main bus terminus. It was used for various events, including the Republic Day national festivities which were televised on the programme Mill-Maltin gƒßall-Maltin. A platform was built on the fountain's upper platter to house entertainment acts which included concerts as well as motorcycles climbing on the plate over specially-constructed ramps. This greatly weakened the structure, and together with natural deterioration, it resulted in the tank mounted inside the basin failing to limit the water supported inside. This caused an excessive amount of water to remain in the platter, which strained the bronze Triton figures supporting it. One of the Tritons' arms broke on 1 March 1978, and the platter collapsed resulting in significant damage to two of the three Tritons. In 1986, the basin and damaged figures were repaired at the Malta Drydocks, and a central pillar was added to support the weight of the platter. Water no longer passed through the Tritons' arms, but through a pipe in this pillar. The fountain was functional on 1 May 1987, and repairs cost around Lm10,000. The central pillar was designed by Apap himself, even though he was against this repair work, and it was cast in bronze in Verona. These interventions have been called \\"inartistic\\" and have been widely criticized as destroying the fountain's original harmony. In the late 1990s, the fountain's water and lighting systems were refurbished by the Malta Desalination Services and the Water Works Division. Over time, further deterioration to the sculpture occurred, including corrosion and cracks in the figures. In 2017, Minister Joe Mizzi stated that the bronze figures had deteriorated to such an extent that they \\"would have been lost\\" if they had not been restored. The travertine slabs in the fountain's base also sustained substantial damage and staining over the years. Proposed relocation The garden near the Malta Memorial, where the Triton Fountain would have been relocated according to the 2011 proposal In 2011, works began on a project by Renzo Piano to redesign the entrance of Valletta. This project included rebuilding the City Gate and landscaping the surrounding area, and Piano recommended that the Triton Fountain be shifted some distance away from its location immediately outside Valletta's entrance. The proposed relocation was announced by the Ministry for Infrastructure, Transport and Communications in April 2011, and it was meant to create an open space and restore \\"the architectural and historical context of the entrance to the fortified city\\". The approach to the City Gate would be flanked by trees and only accessible to pedestrians, while the fountain was to be restored and shifted to the garden opposite the Hotel Phoenicia, close to the Malta Memorial and the MCP car park. This would have moved the fountain from the limits of Valletta to Floriana. The proposed relocation was controversial, and although some welcomed the proposal, most people were against moving the landmark fountain. Opponents stated that since the fountain has an underground system of passages, it is impossible to move it without destroying and rebuilding it, and the fountain might not work at all if moved. Concerns were also raised that the Triton figures would be damaged if they were to be moved. In December 2011, Minister Austin Gatt announced that the fountain will not be moved, and after restoration it will serve as the centerpiece of Piano's redesigned entrance to Valletta. The fountain was scheduled as a Grade 1 property by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority on 8 May 2012, as one of the \\"20th Century Modernist Architecture and Monuments in Valletta and Floriana\\". On 28 December of the same year, it was included on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Restoration The Triton figures being dismantled prior to being sent for restoration in February 2017 Restoring the fountain to its lost original splendour (without the central sculpture) had rarely or better never been considered in view of the fact that the fountain was in such a dilapidated state that to most, (politicians included) it had very few limited merits. To make matters worse, established conservation ethics dictated black on white that an artefact's history is part and parcel of the artefact and should not be erased. Curiously enough except for Robert Cassar from the Palace Armoury, no other qualified conservator expressed any feelings publicly to stop the proposed fracas. The general perspective of most was that it was a flea ridden pit in a God forsaken place. Furthermore being dead centre in the middle of a disorganised bus terminus made it even more shabby. The aforementioned plans to relocate the fountain manifested this fact outrightly, however it was clear that the fountain super and sub-structure would never survive the move. Plans to restore the fountain were first made during the 2011 relocation proposal. After it was announced that the fountain will remain in its original location, it was mentioned that ‚Ç¨2 million would be allocated to restore it, removing the alterations done in the 1980s. In January 2015, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure announced that restoration will begin that year and would be complete by 2017, at a cost of ‚Ç¨500,000. However, nothing materialized initially and the Ministry only began the process to restore the fountain in October 2015. A month later, a pre-qualification questionnaire for prospective bidders interested in restoring the fountain was issued. The government made attempts to find a suitable bidder throughout 2016, until the Ministry signed a contract with Sea Fountain One on 12 January 2017 to restore the fountain to its original state by the end of the year. Restoration work, is to cost about ‚Ç¨4 million since the damage was worse than expected. Restoration on the rest of the fountain on site, in June 2017 The Triton figures began to be dismantled on 4 February 2017, and they were later sent to Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry in Florence to be cleaned. The concrete that was used to fill the brass figures has been removed. A steel structure has been built inside the figures so as to support the weight of the plate, and each figure is now covered in microcrystalline wax for protection and was painted in azurite blue as was their original colour in 1959. The massive base of the fountain was restored by the De Feo Restauri of Rome, a specialized company in restoration of monuments. A new plant room has been constructed, which is connected to the new pump room through a tunnel. The restored Triton figures were sent back to Malta and reinstalled in August 2017, and renovation works of the surrounding square continued until the end of the year.  Formal inauguration Plaque commemorating the fountain's inauguration in 2018 The restored fountain was finally (59 years late) officially inaugurated on 12 January 2018, by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. The works were completed a week ahead of Valletta taking its position as European Capital of Culture 2018. It was stated that the restoration cost amounted to ‚Ç¨4.5 million. Legacy The fountain was depicted on a ‚Ç¨0.32 postage stamp issued by MaltaPost on 27 March 2013.

Sitting on more than 130 acres, Villanova's campus has many athletic facilities, two dormitories, sports fields and trails, a gym, and tennis courts. The school is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and is a member of the Augustinian Secondary Education Association. Established in October 1924 at the request of Bishop John Cantwell (John Joseph Cantwell), Villanova was founded by Augustinians invited to California from Villanova, Pennsylvania to open parishes in the early 1920s. Villanova is a member of the Augustinian Secondary Education Association (ASEA) comprising eight secondary institutions in North America and over 100 schools worldwide. Villanova offers both a day and resident program and is the only co-ed Augustinian boarding school in the country. Villanova has a small chapel that holds mass every Sunday for both students and the public. In 2015-16, student enrollment was 265. Thirty-four percent of students are boarders, and represent 14 different countries. Academics Villanova Preparatory School offers a college prep curriculum for grades 9‚Äì12. As of May 2015, Villanova is an International Baccalaureate World School, offering the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme for its junior and senior students.URL: http://www.ibo.org/en/school/050350 Operating on the semester system, students take seven courses each year with classes meeting a minimum of four times a week with extended 80 minute periods on most weeks. The curriculum includes four units of religion: Old Testament, New Testament, Morality and Social Justice, and Christian Vocations. Math, English, Foreign Language, Religion and Science courses are required for all four years in order to graduate. Two languages are offered: Spanish and Latin. The school also offers Honors courses in other subjects such as Calculus, English Composition, English Literature, and US History. Other graduation requirements include the completion of courses in: Fine Art, P.E, Health, Electives and a yearly completion of community service. Resident Life Villanova houses approximately sixty-five boys and thirty girls. A majority of the boarding students come from Taiwan and South Korea, with a smaller number of students coming from China, Vietnam, Mexico, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, United States and other countries. In contrast, the non-boarding day students at Villanova make up about 70% of the student body. Roughly 30% are from the Ojai Valley, while the rest of the students come from surrounding cities such as Carpinteria, Ventura, Camarillo, Santa Paula, Oxnard, Somis, and Fillmore. Student life Villanova Preparatory school offers its students over 20 clubs, Student Government (ASB), all school Mass, Christian service program, Class Retreats, and Drama Productions. Annually, Villanova holds Wildcat Day, a daylong pep rally where students compete in track and field games. Patron saint The school is named in honour of St. Thomas of Villanova, a sixteenth- century Spanish Augustinian. Thomas was born at Fuenllana in the diocese of Toledo, Spain, in 1488 and was brought up in Villaneuva de los Infantes, a nearby town; hence his name, Thomas of Villanova. In the year 1544, King Charles V of Spain appointed Thomas as Archbishop of Valencia. Thomas succeeded in the spiritual renewal of his diocese, and gained the title 'Father of the Poor'. He gave two-thirds of the income of his diocese to care for the poor in various ways. Each day up to 500 poor people came to his door to be fed and to receive money. Other English-speaking Augustinian Colleges named for this saint are St. Thomas of Villanova College in Ontario, Canada, and Villanova College, located in Brisbane, Australia. He is also the patron saint to the Catholic college, Villanova University located in Villanova, PA,USA. The Augustinian Order in North America The North American foundation of the Order was formed in 1796 when Irish friars arrived in Philadelphia. Michael Hurley was the first American to join the Order the following year. Friars established schools, Universities and other works throughout the Americas, also including Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania located just outside Philadelphia (USA) and Merrimack College (USA). Malvern Preparatory School was founded in 1842 alongside Villanova University, and by 1909 two Augustinian houses and a school had been established in Chicago, 1922 in San Diego, by 1925 this school; and Los Angeles; 1926 a school in Oklahoma; in 1947 a college in Massachusetts; in 1953 a school in Pennsylvania; 1959 a school in New Jersey and in 1962 a school in Illinois. Athletics Despite its size Villanova offers 19 sports, and has had remarkable success particularly in its aquatics department / water polo where Head Coach Tim Settem has turned the program into a dominant force. Girls water polo has won three straight league titles and has advanced to CIF Southern Section semi-finals twice between 2017-2019. The girls' Volleyball, Basketball and tennis teams have also brought league titles and CIF playoff runs. In football, Head Coach Ricardo Olivares has rebuilt things from the ground up within the 8-man system and created a powerhouse program leading to both league titles and deep CIF playoff runs. Olivares is also the school's athletic director. Fall Sports include: football, boys' water polo, girls' volleyball and girls' tennis. Winter Sports include: boys' basketball, girls' basketball, boys' soccer, girls' soccer and girls' water polo. Spring Sports include: baseball, softball, swimming, track and field, boys' golf, and boys' tennis. Football Villanova discontinued its football program in 1974, but it was brought back as an 8-man program in 2001 under Head Coach and Athletic Director, John Muller. The program was remarkably successful in 8-man between 2001 and 2003. In 2004, the program made the jump to 11-man football as an Independent (non-league) Division XIII team. The original 11-man coaching staff consisted of Head Coach John Muller, Line/Defense Coach Tyler Wiggins, Linebacker/Running Back/ Defensive coach Mike Lenehan, and Receiver/Defensive Back Coach John Howard. In only its second year, the team went undefeated during the 2005 season and made the CIF playoffs. In 2006 the team joined the Tri-County Athletic Association (TCAA) as a Division XI team, and was placed in the Frontier League where it often competed against schools three to four times its size. Although out-sized the Wildcats were always competitive and looking to expand the program when a school administrative change took take place. At that time support for many of the school's athletic programs were dramatically cut or eliminated. The football program was hit the worst, and By 2011 much of the original coaching staff as well as a handful of standout players had transferred to other schools. This resulted in many young, outstanding local Ojai athletes who'd originally committed to attend the school and play football (many with older brothers who'd played for the Wildcats) change their plans and go elsewhere - either to Saint Bonaventure High School in Ventura,CA or Nordhoff High School in Ojai, CA. The 11-man program never recovered, struggling as in the Frontier League through 2013. Villanova is currently back to an 8-man program, and since the takeover by Head Coach Olivares has been extremely successful. Citrus Coast League Affiliation As of 2018 Villanova has joined the newly formed Citrus Coast League.

The current parish is a descendant of a small mission by the Right Reverend Jackson Kemper. It is located in Milwaukee's downtown Yankee Hill neighborhood. The Gothic Revival church building was designed by E. Townsend Mix, a noted Milwaukee architect, and constructed as Olivet Congregational Church in 1868. The building was sold to the Episcopal diocese in 1871 when the Olivet congregation faced bankruptcy, and was consecrated as a cathedral in 1898. Incense was first used at All Saints Cathedral on Epiphany, 1902. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. With . The cathedral complex, which includes the church, an attached guild hall and nearby bishop's manse, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a Milwaukee City Landmark in 1973. The tower and steeple, approximately 200 feet tall, houses a bronze bell cast in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1867 one year before the church was built. It measures almost 40 inches in diameter at the mouth, weighs approximately 1,200 pounds and is tuned to an A. Currently, the cathedral is raising money to hang an additional five bells, tuned to F, E-flat, D, C, and B-flat. All bells will be rung by a computerized external striker, and the pre-existing bell can also be swung to ring it.

The Sienna marble altar and triptych was designed and built by Eugene W. Mason, Jr. of New York City, and is of Italian Gothic styling. Embossed in the bronze door of the tabernacle is the Agnus Dei, the Lamb of God, signifying the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist. The figures on the predella (just below the center panel) are from the left: Saints Thomas Becket, Joan of Arc, St. Mary the Virgin, Francis of Assisi, and Demetrius of Alexandria. Most of the stained glass windows in the cathedral were designed and produced in England, most by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake of London. A large rondel window of Christ the King was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, also of London. Today's church features a liturgy in the Anglo-Catholic tradition.

History Landsat 7 imagery of the greater Geelong area. Lara is visible in the north. The explorers Hume and Hovell arrived at Lara on December 16, 1824, believing that they had reached Westernport Bay. They recorded that the Aboriginals described the bay as Djillong and land as Corayo, suggesting origins for the names of Geelong and Corio. The area was originally named Kennedy's Creek but was also given several different names including Duck Ponds, Hovell's Creek, Cheddar, Swindon and Lara Lake. The area of Lara was no more than a few farms at this time. The railway through the town was opened in 1857 along with the local railway station, with several subdivisions then announced. A Post Office opened on 1 March 1858 as Duck Ponds, renamed Hovell's Creek in 1872, and finally Lara in 1884. The population grew to a few hundred by 1890, and several facilities like schools and churches were built, but a municipal water supply was not completed until 1947. In January 1969, 17 people were killed in bushfires which ravaged Lara. Most of the victims were trapped by the fast-moving grass fire while travelling on the Princes Highway.https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/the-1969-lara-grass-fire- killed-17-people-and-high-risk-of-more-deadly-grass-fires-this-summer/news- story/8af3f02fabcd57779181effabd9eaefa Several scenes from the 1979 feature film Mad Max were shot on location around Lara, as well as several scenes from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation mockumentary We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year, in which the town carried the fictional name \\"Dunt\\". The town's history is being preserved at the Lara Museum and Historical Centre on the corner of Forest and Canterbury Roads. This historic property, formerly the Lake Bank Hotel (circa 1860), was renovated by local businessman Lino Bisinella and provided in 2013 to the community group which runs the museum, Lara Heritage and Historical Inc. Heritage listed sites Lara contains a number of heritage listed sites, including: * 605 Bacchus Marsh Road, Elcho Homestead * Princes Highway, Hume and Hovell Monument * 108 Windermere Road, Pirra Homestead Population According to the 2016 census, there were 16,355 people in Lara. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.4% of the population. * 80.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, Philippines 1.4%, New Zealand 1.0%, Scotland 0.8% and Vietnam 0.6%. * 81.9% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Croatian 0.7%, Tagalog 0.7% and Italian 0.7%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 31.8% and Catholic 26.2%. Geography Hovell's Creek runs through Lara and ends at Limeburners Bay, a small inlet of Corio Bay. Owing to the poor soils and low runoff inherent in Australian streams, along with the fact the region is the driest in southern Victoria because of the Otway Ranges‚Äô rain shadow (receiving about per year), the creek is ephemeral and is not useful as a water source. Granite peaks known as the You Yangs, 4 kilometres north of Lara, rise dramatically to a height of 352m and can be seen from most areas of Geelong.

Balagtas wrote the epic during his imprisonment. He dedicated it to his sweetheart Mar√≠a Asuncion Rivera, whom he nicknamed \\"M.A.R.\\" and is referenced to as \\"Selya\\" in the dedication \\"Kay Selya\\" (\\"For Celia\\"). This is obligatory to read for Grade 8 students in the Philippines. Form Florante at Laura is written as an awit; the word in modern Filipino means \\"song\\", but at that time referred to a standard poetic format with the following characteristics: # four lines per stanza; # twelve syllables per line; # an assonantal rhyme scheme of AAAA (in the Filipino manner of rhyming described by Jos√© Rizal in Tagalische Verskunst); # a caesura or pause after the sixth syllable; # each stanza is usually a complete, grammatically correct sentence; # each stanza has figures of speech (according to Fernando Monle√≥n, Balagtas used 28 types in 395 instances throughout the poem.) Synopsis The story is about the love and determination of the Duke Florante and the Princess Laura of Albania while being pursued by the usurper Count Adolfo. Plot=In the Albanian forest The story begins deep within a dark, gloomy forest. Francisco Balagtas wrote the poem \\"Gubat na Mapanglaw\\" to describe the melancholic forest. Florante, a duke of the Kingdom of Albania, is tied to a tree, lamenting the death of his father, Duke Briseo. He is driven mad by the thought that his beloved, Princess Laura, has fallen into the arms of his enemy, Count Adolfo, son of Count Sileno. Nearby, two starving lions keep watch and try to attack Florante. He is saved, just in time, by Aladin, a Persian prince who happens to be at the forest at the same time. Weak and bewildered, Florante faints. The merciful soldier nurses Florante to health. Upon recovery, Florante is initially taken back by Aladin who he considers as an enemy due to his Islamic faith. After a few explanations are made, Florante is grateful and begins to tell his story. Florante's tale The son of a princess and a royal adviser, Florante grew up in happiness, showered with love. He liked to play games when he was six years old, and was almost captured by a vulture that entered in their mountain cottage, which was also followed by the attack of a falcon. He was saved by his cousin Menalipo, an archer from Epirus. When he turned eleven, his parents, Duke Briseo and Princess Floresca, sent him to Athens, Greece to study under Antenor, a renowned teacher. There, he met Adolfo, a fellow countryman, the brightest student in their school. After six years of study, Florante surpassed Adolfo's capabilities, talents, and intelligence, gaining popularity. While acting during a school play, Adolfo attempted to kill Florante because of his jealousy towards Florante's popularity. Florante's friend, Menandro, was quick enough to intervene. Adolfo headed home to Albania after his failed attempt. One year later, Florante received a letter from his father, announcing the death of his mother. Though filled with grief, Florante waited two years before he returned home. Menandro, unwilling to be separated from him, accompanied him on his journey. Upon his arrival to Albania, an emissary of the kingdom of Crotona requested his assistance in the incoming war against the Persians. Florante had not the will to refuse, for the King of Crotona was his grandfather. During his stay in Albania, Florante was invited to the royal palace and was glamoured of Laura, the daughter of King Linceo. Coming to the aid of Crotona, Florante fought with the Persian general Osmalik for five hours, finally slaying him in the end. He stayed in Crotona for five months before returning to Albania to see Laura. He was surprised by the sight of a Persian flag waving atop the kingdom. He recaptured the palace and saved his father, the King, and Count Adolfo. He also saved Laura from being beheaded from the hands of the Emir and was declared \\"Defender of Albania\\" for his bravery, deepening Adolfo's envy and hatred. Florante protected the kingdom once more from the Turkish forces under General Miramolin, an acclaimed conqueror. This took place in Aetolia, where he later received a letter from his father summoning him back to Albania. He left his troops in the care of his friend, Menandro, and upon returning, he was ambushed by 30,000 soldiers under Adolfo's orders and was imprisoned for 18 days. There, he learned of the tragic fate of his father and the king who were beheaded under Adolfo. Florante was then exiled into the forest and tied to the tree. Aladin's tale After Florante finishes his story, it was Aladin's turn to recount his life. He first introduces himself as Prince Aladin of the Persian kingdom, son of Sultan Ali-Adab. While walking through the forest, Aladin tells about his fianc√©e, Flerida. Unbeknownst to him at that time, his father also desired Flerida. After returning home from a battle (revealed to be the battle of Florante and General Osmalik), Ali-Adab imprisoned the Prince, using his abandonment of his troops as the reason, and the eventual loss made the latter order a decapacitation of Aladin. In a turn of events, Aladin was released by a general on orders from his father, with the constraint that he may never enter the kingdom again. Heartbroken, he unknowingly walks to the forest where Florante was tied up. Reunion and peace Aladin's speech is interrupted when they hear voices. A woman narrates her escape from a kingdom and a marriage. She speaks of her search for her beloved, a search which lasted six years. She shares that while deep in the forest, she heard cries for help, and upon finding a lady about to be raped, she uses her bow and arrow to kill the assailant. The woman introduces herself as Flerida. The lady saved by Flerida is revealed to be Laura, who begins to tell her story. While her love was away at war, Count Adolfo used deceit to gain popularity and turned the people of Albania against their king. Count Adolfo then rose to the throne, forcing Laura to be his queen. An army under Menandro, Florante's childhood friend, was able to overthrow Adolfo from power. Seeing all was lost, Adolfo fled into the woods with Laura as his hostage. After hearing all this, Florante and Aladin reunite with their loved ones. Florante and Laura return to Albania to rule as king and queen. Aladin and Flerida returned to Persia, where Aladin became the new sultan as his father died of depression because Flerida had left him. Aladin and Flerida are then baptized into the Catholic faith, and the two kingdoms lived in harmony and peace.

They are commonly known as blanket octopodes, in reference to the long, transparent webs that connect the dorsal and dorsolateral arms of the adult females. The other arms are much shorter and lack webbing. Tremoctopus violaceus exhibits the most extreme degree of sexual size-dimorphism known in any non-microscopic animal. Females may reach in length, whereas the males are 2.4 cm. The weight ratio is at least 10,000:1, and can probably reach as much as 40,000:1. The males have a large arm in a spherical pouch modified for mating, known as a hectocotylus. During mating, this arm is detached, and kept by the female in her mantle cavity until used for fertilisation. The male almost certainly dies shortly after mating. There is competition between the males, multiple male arms have been found in the mantle cavity of females. The females carry more than 100,000 eggs attached to a sausage-shaped calcareous secretion held at the base of the dorsal arms and carried by the female until hatching. Blanket octopodes are immune to the venomous Portuguese man o' war, whose tentacles the male and immature females rip off and use for offensive and defensive purposes. Like many other octopodes, the blanket octopus uses ink to intimidate potential predators. Also, when threatened, the female unfurls her large net-like membranes that spread out and billow in the water, greatly increasing her apparent size.

His reign, until the end, was one of the most stable and prosperous during the Southern Dynasties. He came from the same family that ruled Southern Qi, but from a different branch. Emperor Wu created universities and extending the Confucian civil service exams, demanding that sons of nobles study. He was well read himself and wrote poetry and patronized the arts. Although for governmental affairs he was Confucian in values, he embraced Buddhism as well. He himself was attracted to many Indian traditions. He banned the sacrifice of animals and was against execution. It was said that he received the Buddhist precepts during his reign, earning him the nickname The Bodhisattva Emperor. The Emperor is the namesake of the Emperor Liang Jeweled Repentance (Ê¢ÅÁöáÂØ≥Êá∫), a widely read and major Buddhist text in China and Korea. At the end of his reign, his overly lenient attitude on his clan's and officials' corruption and lack of dedication to the state came at a heavy price; when the general Hou Jing rebelled, few came to his aid, and Hou captured the capital Jiankang, holding Emperor Wu and his successor Emperor Jianwen under close control and plunging the entire Liang state into anarchy. Emperor Liang himself died while under house arrest, with some historians believing that Hou starved him to death. Background Xiao Yan was born in 464, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu of Liu Song. His father Xiao Shunzhi (Ëï≠È†Ü‰πã), who claimed ancestry from the great Han Dynasty prime minister Xiao He, was a distant cousin of the Liu Song general Xiao Daocheng, and was part of Xiao Daocheng's close circle of advisors in Xiao Daocheng's eventual seizure of the Liu Song throne and establishment of Southern Qi (as its Emperor Gao) in 479. For Xiao Shunzhi's contributions, Xiao Daocheng created him the Marquess of Linxiang and made him a general. Xiao Yan was Xiao Shunzhi's third son, and his mother was Xiao Shunzhi's wife Zhang Zhirou (ÂºµËá≥Êüî), who was also the mother of his older brothers Xiao Yi (Ëï≠Êáø) and Xiao Fu (Ëï≠Êï∑), his younger brother Xiao Chang (Ëï≠Êö¢), and his younger sister Xiao Linyi (Ëï≠‰ª§Â´ï). Lady Zhang died in 471, predating Xiao Shunzhi's becoming a marquess during Southern Qi. Xiao Yan had six other brothers born of Xiao Shunzhi's concubines. One of them, Xiao Xiu (475‚Äì518) is now mainly remembered because of his comparatively well-preserved funerary statuary ensemble near Nanjing.Albert E. Dien, ¬´Six Dynasties Civilization¬ª. Yale University Press, 2007 . Partial text on Google Books. P. 190. A reconstruction of the original form of the ensemble is shown in Fig. 5.19.Ê¢ÅÂÆâÊàêÂ∫∑ÁéãËêßÁßÄÂ¢ìÁü≥Âàª (Sculptures at the Tomb of Xiao Xiu) (description and modern photos) Around 481 or 482, Xiao Yan married Chi Hui (ÈÉóÂæΩ), the daughter of the Liu Song official Chi Ye (ÈÉóÁáÅ) and the Princess Xunyang. She bore him three daughters‚ÄîXiao Yuyao (Ëï≠ÁéâÂßö), Xiao Yuwan (Ëï≠ÁéâÂ©â), and Xiao Yuhuan (Ëï≠ÁéâÂ¨õ), but no sons. Career as Southern Qi official and general Xiao Yan was considered intelligent and handsome in his youth, and he started his career as a Southern Qi official by serving as military assistant for Emperor Wu's son Xiao Zilun (Ëï≠Â≠êÂÄ´) the Prince of Baling, and later served on the staff of the prime minister Wang Jian. Wang was said to be impressed by Xiao Yan's talents and appearance, and he once said, \\"Mr. Xiao will be Shizhong [‰æç‰∏≠, a high-level post] before he turns 30, and his honor will be innumerable after he turns 30.\\" Xiao Yan also associated with Wang's successor as prime minister, Emperor Wu's son Xiao Ziliang (Ëï≠Â≠êËâØ) the Prince of Jingling, and became one of eight young officials talented in the literary arts particularly befriended by Xiao Ziliang‚Äîalong with Fan Yun, Xiao Chen (Ëï≠Áêõ), Ren Fang (‰ªªÊòâ), Wang Rong (ÁéãËûç), Xie Tiao (Ë¨ùÊúì), Shen Yue, and Lu Chui (Èô∏ÂÄï). After his father Xiao Shunzhi died in 490, he temporary left governmental service, but subsequently returned, and by 493 was serving on Xiao Ziliang's staff, but he did not join Wang Rong's plan to start a coup to have Xiao Ziliang made emperor when Emperor Wu grew ill in 493; the throne, instead, went to the crown prince, Emperor Wu's grandson Xiao Zhaoye. Xiao Yan subsequently was invited by the prime minister Xiao Luan to serve on his staff, and when Xiao Luan subsequently overthrew the frivolous Xiao Zhaoye in a coup, Xiao Yan was made a general and ordered to defend the important city Shouyang (Â£ΩÈôΩ, in modern Lu'an, Anhui). When Xiao Luan later took the throne (as Emperor Ming), Xiao Yan was created the Baron of Jianyang. In 495, when Northern Wei forces invade, Xiao Yan was on the frontline fighting Northern Wei troops, and he distinguished himself under the command of Wang Guangzhi (ÁéãÂª£‰πã). Later that year, when Emperor Ming suspected the general Xiao Chen (Ëï≠Ë´∂) of treason and executed him, it was Xiao Yan that he sent to arrest and execute Xiao Chen's brother Xiao Dan (Ëï≠Ë™ï) the governor of Si Province (Âè∏Â∑û, modern southeastern Henan). In 497, with Northern Wei again attacking, Xiao Yan was one of the generals that Emperor Ming sent to aid the embattled Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern southwestern Henan and northwestern Hubei). Even though both he and his commander, Cui Huijing (Â¥îÊÖßÊôØ), were subsequently defeated by Northern Wei forces in battle, in 498 Xiao Yan was made the governor of Yong Province and the defender of Yong Province's capital, the important city Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), and he continued in that post after Emperor Ming's death and succession by his son Xiao Baojuan. It was at Xiangyang that Xiao Yan's wife Chi Hui died in 499. Xiao Yan would not take another wife for the rest of his life, although he would have a number of concubines. Civil war against Xiao Baojuan When Xiao Baojuan became Southern Qi's emperor in 498 at age 15, his power was initially curbed by several high-level officials that his father Emperor Ming left in charge‚Äîincluding Emperor Ming's cousins Jiang Shi (Ê±üÁ•è) and Jiang Si (Ê±üÁ•Ä), Xiao Baojuan's own uncle Liu Xuan (ÂäâÊöÑ), Xiao Baojuan's cousin Xiao Yaoguang (Ëï≠ÈÅôÂÖâ) the Prince of Shi'an, the senior official Xu Xiaosi (ÂæêÂ≠ùÂó£), and the general Xiao Tanzhi (Ëï≠Âù¶‰πã). The six officials each handled important matters of state according to their will and paid the young emperor little deference, drawing his ire. Xiao Yan, hearing that the young emperor had a reputation for being violent and frivolous, secretly prepared for eventual civil war at his post at Yong Province, but was unable to persuade his older brother Xiao Yi, who was then the acting governor of Ying Province (ÈÉ¢Â∑û, modern eastern Hubei), to do the same. In 499, receiving report that the high-level officials were planning to, on account of his irrational behavior, remove him from the throne, Xiao Baojuan acted first and executed Jiang Shi and Jiang Si. Xiao Yaoguang, who wanted to be emperor himself and feared being the next target, started an unsuccessful coup and was soon defeated and killed. However, despite the contributions of Xiao Tanzhi, Xu Xiaosi, Liu Xuan, and the generals Shen Wenji (Ê≤àÊñáÂ≠£) and Cao Hu (ÊõπËôé) in defeating Xiao Yaoguang, Xiao Baojuan soon had all of them killed as well on suspicion of plotting coups, leading to widespread sense of terror among central government officials. This led to a rebellion by the senior general Chen Xianda (Èô≥È°ØÈÅî) from his post at Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and Fujian), which was quickly defeated as well, fanning Xiao Baojuan's sense of invulnerability. In fear, the general Pei Shuye (Ë£¥ÂèîÊ•≠), who controlled Shouyang as the governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, modern central Anhui), surrendered Shouyang to Northern Wei in 500, despite Xiao Yan's counsel against it. Xiao Baojuan sent Cui Huijing to try to recapture Shouyang. Cui Huijing, however, as soon as he left the capital Jiankang, turned his army around and marched on the capital, hoping to overthrow Xiao Baojuan and replace him with his brother Xiao Baoxuan (Ëï≠ÂØ∂ÁéÑ) the Prince of Jiangxia. Cui was initially successful, surrounding Xiao Baojuan's troops inside the palace complex. However, Xiao Yi, upon hearing news of Cui's rebellion, marched troops under his command to relieve the palace siege. He routed Cui's forces, and Cui was killed while trying to escape. Xiao Baojuan made Xiao Yi the prime minister, but soon killed him as well. Upon hearing of Xiao Yi's death, Xiao Yan announced a rebellion. Xiao Baojuan sent an army commanded by the general Liu Shanyang (ÂäâÂ±±ÈôΩ) against Xiao Yan, but Xiao Yan convinced Xiao Yingzhou (Ëï≠Á©éÂÜë), the chief of staff of Xiao Baojuan's younger brother Xiao Baorong the Prince of Nankang, who was then governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern central and western Hubei), that Liu was intending to attack both Jing and Yong Province. Xiao Yingzhou therefore entered into an alliance with Xiao Yan, and Xiao Yingzhou surprised and killed Liu, and then declared that his and Xiao Yan's intent was to declare Xiao Baorong emperor, although he did not immediately have Xiao Baorong take imperial title. (Privately, Xiao Yan's staff was distrustful of Xiao Yingzhou and wanted to seize Xiao Baorong by force, but Xiao Yan, not willing to create a division in the coalition at that moment, concentrated on advancing east against Xiao Baojuan rather than to seize Xiao Baorong.) In spring 501, Xiao Yingzhou declared Xiao Baorong emperor (as Emperor He), a declaration that Xiao Yan recognized. Xiao Yingzhou had himself and Xiao Yan given equivalent titles, and Xiao Yingzhou remained at Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), the capital of Jing Province, with the new emperor, while Xiao Yan continued to advance against the old emperor Xiao Baojuan. With Xiao Baojuan having lost the love of his generals (and having to fight off several more coup attempts within Jiankang itself), Xiao Yan was able to win battle after battle, capturing Yingcheng (ÈÉ¢Âüé, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) in summer 501, and then forcing the surrender of Chen Bozhi (Èô≥‰ºØ‰πã), the governor of Jiang Province, in fall 501. In winter 501, he reached Jiankang and quickly captured the outer city, and then put the palace under siege. Meanwhile, Xiao Yingzhou, unable to fend off attacks that the general Xiao Gui (Ëï≠Áíù), loyal to Xiao Baojuan, was launching from the west, died in anxiety. Xiao Yan's brother Xiao Dan (Ëï≠ÂÑã) quickly arrived in Jiangling to take over custody of Emperor He, along with Xiao Yingzhou's lieutenant Xiaohou Xiang (Â§è‰æØË©≥). From that point on, the control of the new emperor was no longer contested. Around the new year 502, Xiao Baojuan's generals Wang Zhenguo (ÁéãÁèçÂúã) and Zhang Ji (ÂºµÁ®∑), fearful that Xiao Baojuan would kill them because they were unable to lift the siege, assassinated Xiao Baojuan and surrendered. Xiao Yan entered the palace triumphantly, and, making Xiao Zhaoye's mother Empress Dowager Wang Baoming titular regent, he had himself made the supreme commander and the Duke of Jian'an. Establishment of the Liang dynasty Xiao Yan soon began to carry out plans to take over imperial title himself. Consulting with his old friends Shen Yue and Fan Yun, he began to put his brothers and associates into important posts, while having Empress Dowager Wang grant him higher and higher honors and titles, while delaying Emperor He's return to the capital. He also began to execute Emperor He's brothers and cousins one by one, to eliminate the possibility of their resisting his moves. (Emperor He's brother Xiao Baoyin the Prince of Poyang, however, would escape to Northern Wei, and for decades would pose a threat as a Northern Wei general.) He had himself created the Duke of Liang, and then the Prince of Liang, and given the nine bestowments, all signs of impending takeover. Only with these preparations in place did he have Emperor He sent back toward the capital. Before Emperor He reached Jiankang, however, in spring 502, while Emperor He had only reached Gushu (ÂßëÂ≠∞, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), Xiao Yan had him issue an edict giving the throne to Xiao Yan, ending Southern Qi and beginning Liang Dynasty (with Xiao Yan as its Emperor Wu). Xiao Yan created Emperor He the Prince of Baling, but soon had him put to death, ending Emperor Ming's line (except for Xiao Baoyin, and Xiao Baoyi who was born disabled), although he treated Emperor Gao's and Emperor Wu's remaining progeny (most of those two emperors' progeny having been slaughtered by Emperor Ming) with honor and respect, making many of them his officials, reasoning that he and Southern Qi's imperial clan had the same origin. Emperor Wu created his infant son Xiao Tong, who was born of his concubine Consort Ding during the war against Xiao Baojuan, crown prince. (He had previously adopted his brother Xiao Hong (Ëï≠ÂÆè)'s son Xiao Zhengde as his son, and Xiao Zhengde wanted to be crown prince; instead, after creating Xiao Tong crown prince, Emperor Wu rescinded the adoption and returned Xiao Zhengde to Xiao Hong's household, drawing Xiao Zhengde's resentment.) Early Reign The early reign of Emperor Wu was considered to be Liang Dynasty's prime. He was considered diligent and frugal, and he tried to foster willingness for his officials to have different opinions than his. However, an immediate troubling sign for his reign, which would become increasingly serious as time went on, was how he appeared to be willing to tolerate corruption by his own family members, particularly his brother Xiao Hong the Prince of Linchuan, and those high-level officials who he felt contributed to his establishment of Liang. Emperor Wu also became the first emperor in Southern Dynasties' history to explicitly grant prime ministerial authorities to designated officials who were not prime ministers in name. He first granted those authorities to Fan Yun, and after Fan's death in 503, granted those authorities to Zhou She and Xu Mian, even though neither officially carried a high rank until late in their careers. Two immediate threats that Emperor Wu had to deal with upon ascending the throne were rebellions by Chen Bozhi, who did not feel secure in his position despite Emperor Wu's permitting him to remain as the governor of Jiang Province, and Liu Jilian (ÂäâÂ≠£ÈÄ£) the governor of Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), who was similarly apprehensive. By winter 502, however, Chen had been defeated by Emperor Wu's general Wang Mao (ÁéãËåÇ) and was forced to flee to Northern Wei. In spring 503, Liu surrendered to Emperor Wu's general Deng Yuanqi (ÈÑßÂÖÉËµ∑), and the realm was pacified. However, in fall 503, Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei, with a mind of having Xiao Baoyin reestablish Southern Qi as a puppet state, commissioned Xiao Baoyin and Chen with armies, and further sent his father Emperor Xiaowen's cousin Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng to lead a force to attack Liang, starting a war that lasted several years. Both sides had victories. However, Liang lost the important border city Yiyang (Áæ©ÈôΩ, in modern Xinyang, Henan) in fall 504, and in spring 505, the general Xiahou Daoqian (Â§è‰æØÈÅìÈÅ∑) rebelled and surrendered another important border city, Nanzheng (ÂçóÈÑ≠, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to Northern Wei. (It was in the aftermaths of Xiahou's rebellion that the first serious instance of Emperor Wu's refusal to punish a family member happened, as his nephew Xiao Yuanzao (Ëï≠Ê∑µËóª) the Marquess of Xichang, angry that when he rendezvoused with Deng Yuanqi that Deng took the best horses, assassinated Deng and falsely accused Deng of treason. While Emperor Wu discovered that Xiao Yuanzao's accusations were false and posthumously honored Deng, he took no punishment against Xiao Yuanzao other than demoting his rank.) In 505, Emperor Wu launched a major counterattack, commanded by Xiao Hong, with Liang's best troops. However, the apprehensive Xiao Hong stopped his army at Luokou (Ê¥õÂè£, in modern Bengbu, Anhui) and refused to advance, despite his generals' urging. Meanwhile, in spring 506, the general Wei Rui (ÈüãÂè°) was able to capture Hefei (ÂêàËÇ•, in modern Hefei, Anhui), taken by Northern Wei when Pei Shuye surrendered Shouyang to Northern Wei. In fall 506, Xiao Hong's army, stationed at Luokou for nearly a year without advancing, had an attack of night terror, and Xiao Hong, in fear, fled, causing his army to collapse without a battle. When Northern Wei forces next attacked the fortress of Zhongli (ÈçæÈõ¢, in modern Bengbu as well), however, they were defeated by a Liang army commanded by Wei and Cao Jingzong (ÊõπÊôØÂÆó) in spring 507, allowing Liang to keep Zhongli and effectively ending the war. After the battle of Zhongli, there would continue to be border battles from time to time, but no large scale war for years. In 511, when Emperor Wu received petition from an old peasant, who stopped him on the road when he was in the vicinity of Jiankang to offer sacrifices to heaven, that his criminal laws were too severe for the commoners (in particular, if one person committed a crime, the entire clan is punished), while being overly relaxing for officials and nobles, Emperor Wu considered revisions to the law. However, at the end, all he carried out was that criminals' clan members would not be required to undergo hard labor if they had seniors or children in their household, and he did not further reform his laws. Starting in 514, Emperor Wu started carrying out a major construction project, downstream from Shouyang on the Huai River‚Äîa major dam that was intended to create a reservoir to flood Shouyang to allow Liang to capture the city. He started the project despite opposition from his engineers (who believed that the Huai River contained too much dirt in its water for a dam of the size necessary to be built). Despite engineering difficulties, however, the dam was successfully built by the general Kang Xuan (Â∫∑Áµ¢) -- albeit at a major loss of life among the workers, due to the amount of work necessary and the diseases that occurred among them. (Zizhi Tongjian described the casualty rate to be at 70% to 80%.) Northern Wei's regent Empress Dowager Hu (who became regent over Emperor Xiaoming after Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515) sent armies commanded by Li Ping (ÊùéÂπ≥) to attack Kang's escort forces, but could not damage the dam, which was finally completed in summer 516. it was described to be four and a half kilometers long, and the army pitched camp on the dam itself. Kang skillfully maintained the dam, and Shouyang began to be flooded. However, Emperor Wu recalled Kang to the capital and put the general Zhang Baozi (ÂºµË±πÂ≠ê) in charge of the dam. Zhang, far less skillful and attentive than Kang, did not maintain the dam. With Huai River's water level greatly rising in winter 516, the dam collapsed, leading to more than 100,000 deaths downstream, and Shouyang was saved. It is unclear when Emperor Wu began to be a devout Buddhist, but by 517 Buddhist influences on his policies began to be plain. That year, he ordered that imperial textile factories not weave gods and animals on clothes, because when the clothes undergo further manufacturing, the patterns might be damaged, showing disrespect to the gods and hurtfulness to the animals. In a further break from Confucian tradition, he considered making sacrifices to imperial ancestors vegetarian, instead of traditional animal sacrifices of goats, pigs, and cows, and the sacrifices were first changed to using dried meat, and then eventually to mock animals made from flour, vegetables, and fruits, and this change was despite popular opinion that this would bring displeasure from the ancestors. Middle Reign In 522, Emperor Wu's nephew Xiao Zhengde‚Äîwhom he had previously adopted but then unadopted when Xiao Tong was born‚Äîresentful that he was not created crown prince, fled to Northern Wei, claiming to be the deposed crown prince and requesting Northern Wei aid. However, Northern Wei did not take his claim seriously, and in 523 Xiao Zhengde fled back to Liang. Instead of punishing Xiao Zhengde, however, Emperor Wu merely rebuked him tearfully, and in fact restored him to his title of Marquess of Xifeng. In winter 523, with his state plagued by forgeries of its copper coins, Emperor Wu abolished copper coins and started minting iron coins. (The actual fiscal impact of this act was unclear, but traditional Chinese historians generally considered iron to be unsuitable to use for coinage.) In 524, Emperor Wu launched a number of attacks on Northern Wei's southern territory, with Northern Wei forces occupied with fighting agrarian rebellions to the north and west. Liang forces largely met little resistance. Further, in spring 525, the Northern Wei general Yuan Faseng (ÂÖÉÊ≥ïÂÉß) surrendered the key city of Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to Liang. However, in summer 525, Emperor Wu's son Xiao Zong (Ëï≠Á∂ú), who suspected that he was actually the son of Southern Qi's emperor Xiao Baojuan (because his mother Consort Wu was formerly Xiao Baojuan's concubine and had given birth to him only seven months after she became Emperor Wu's concubine), in turn surrendered Pengcheng to Northern Wei, ending Liang's advances in the northeast, although in summer 526, Shouyang fell to Liang troops after Emperor Wu successfully reemployed the damming strategy. For the next several years, Liang continued to make minor gains on the borders with Northern Wei. Over the years, Emperor Wu had increasingly given additional authorities to Xiao Tong the Crown Prince, and the relationship between father and son was dear. However, in 526, after the death of Xiao Tong's mother Consort Ding Lingguang (‰∏Å‰ª§ÂÖâ), the relationship would deteriorate. Xiao Tong sought out an appropriate place to bury Consort Ding, but while he was doing so, a land owner bribed the eunuch Yu Sanfu (‰øû‰∏âÂâØ) into convincing Emperor Wu that that piece of land would bring good fortune for the emperor, and so Emperor Wu bought the land and buried Consort Ding there. However, once Consort Ding was buried, a Taoist monk informed Xiao Tong that he believed that the land would bring ill fortune for Consort Ding's oldest son‚ÄîXiao Tong. Xiao Tong therefore allowed the monk to bury a few items intended to dissolve the ill fortune, such as wax ducks, at the position reserved for the oldest son. Later on, when one of Xiao Tong's attendants, Bao Miaozhi (ÈÆëÈÇà‰πã), was squeezed out of Xiao Tong's inner circles by another attendant, Wei Ya (È≠èÈõÖ), he, in resentment, reported to Emperor Wu that Wei had carried out sorcery on Xiao Tong's behalf. When Emperor Wu investigated, waxed ducks were found, and Emperor Wu became surprised and angry, and wanted to investigate further. He only stopped the investigation when he was advised to do so by the prime minister Xu Mian, executing only the Taoist monk who had suggested the burial of wax ducks. Xiao Tong became humiliated in the affair, and was never able to clear himself completely in his father's eyes. In 527, Emperor Wu made his first offering of himself to the service of Buddha (Êç®Ë∫´, sheshen) at Tongtai Monastery (ÂêåÊ≥∞ÂØ∫), spending three days there. In 528, after a coup in Northern Wei, with the warlord Erzhu Rong overthrowing Empress Dowager Hu (after she killed her own son, Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei, with poison), a number of Northern Wei officials, including Yuan Yue (ÂÖÉÊÇÖ) the Prince of Ru'nan, Yuan Yu (ÂÖÉÂΩß) the Prince of Linhuai, and Yuan Hao the Prince of Beihai, fled to Liang, and a number of other officials surrendered territories they controlled to Liang. In winter 528, Emperor Wu created Yuan Hao the Prince of Wei‚Äîintending to have him lay claim to the Northern Wei throne and, if successful, become a Liang vassal‚Äîand commissioned his general Chen Qingzhi (Èô≥ÊÖ∂‰πã) with an army to escort Yuan Hao back to Northern Wei. Despite the small size of Chen's army, he won battle after battle, and in spring 529, after Chen captured Suiyang (Áù¢ÈôΩ, in modern Shangqiu, Henan), Yuan Hao, with Emperor Wu's approval, proclaimed himself the emperor of Northern Wei. In summer 529, with Northern Wei troops unable to stand up to Chen, Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei fled the Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and Yuan Hao took it. However, Yuan Hao secretly wanted to rebel against Liang, and when Chen requested Emperor Wu to send reinforcements, Yuan Hao sent Emperor Wu a submission advising against it, and Emperor Wu, believing Yuan Hao, did not send additional troops. Soon, Erzhu Rong and Emperor Xiaozhuang counterattacked, and Luoyang fell. Yuan Hao fled and was killed in flight, and Chen's own army was destroyed, although Chen himself was able to flee back to Liang. Emperor Wu, realizing the impossibility of the task he gave Chen, nevertheless created Chen the Marquess of Yongxing in recognition of his victories. In fall 529, Emperor Wu made his second offering of himself to the service of Buddha at Tongtai Monastery‚Äîbut contrary to the first time he did, when he simply spent three days at the monastery, he stripped himself of imperial clothing and wore those of monks, and spent all day carrying out monastic tasks, including daily chores and giving of lectures on the Nirvana Sutra. He spent 12 days at the monastery, and returned to the palace only after the imperial offices made a huge donation to it‚Äîformally, to ransom \\"the Emperor Bodhisattva.\\" In 530, Emperor Wu made another attempt to establish a vassal regime in Northern Wei‚Äîby creating Yuan Yue the Prince of Wei, and commissioning Yuan Yue's uncle Fan Zun (ËåÉÈÅµ) with an army to escort Yuan Yue back to Northern Wei. Yuan Yue made some advances, particularly in light of the disturbance precipitated soon thereafter when Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed and killed Erzhu Rong and was in turn overthrown by Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong. However, Yuan Yue realized that the Erzhus then became firmly in control of Luoyang and that he would be unable to defeat them, and so returned to Liang in winter 530. Xiao Tong's Death Xiao Tong. In 531, Xiao Tong who was the Crown Prince at the time died, and Emperor Wu personally attended his wake and buried him in a tomb appropriate for an emperor. He also summoned Xiao Tong's oldest son, Xiao Huan (Ëï≠Ê≠°) the Duke of Huarong back to the capital Jiankang, preparing to create Xiao Huan crown prince to replace his father, as would be appropriate under Confucian principles of succession. However, still resentful over the wax duck affair, he hesitated for days without carrying out the creation, and finally did not do so. Instead, against popular opinion, he created Xiao Tong's younger brother, also by Consort Ding, Xiao Gang crown prince. To compensate Xiao Tong's three sons, he created the princes of large commandery‚ÄîXiao Huan the Prince of Yuzhang, Xiao Yu (Ëï≠Ë≠Ω) the Prince of Hedong, and Xiao Cha the Prince of Yueyang, but his grandsons continued to resent him. In 532, with Northern Wei again in civil war after the general Gao Huan rose against the Erzhus, Emperor Wu against sent an army to escort Yuan Yue back to Northern Wei, and subsequently, Gao Huan welcomed Yuan Yue, but then decided against making Yuan Yue emperor. Subsequently, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei, whom Gao made emperor, had Yuan Yue executed. In 534, with Mars seen in the Dipper constellation‚Äîtraditionally thought to be a sign that the emperor would be forced to leave the palace‚ÄîEmperor Wu tried to divert the ill fortune by walking barefoot around his palace. However, he soon heard that Northern Wei's Emperor Xiaowu had fled Luoyang in a dispute with Gao splitting Northern Wei into two separate countries. Wu, both glad and embarrassed, stated, \\"Is it that even barbarians correspond to astrological signs?\\" Late Reign Wu in his late reign. With Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in light of Emperor Xiaowu's flight, Emperor Wu initially continued to send his forces to make minor territorial gains on the borders, against both Eastern Wei and Western Wei, for several years. It had been the case throughout Emperor Wu's reign that he was overly lenient to his relatives and high-level officials, but the trend appeared to become more severe late in his reign. His sons, all imperial princes, also grew increasingly disobedient of central authority, often acting as de facto emperors within their provincial domains. By 537, Emperor Wu was at a d√©tente with Eastern Wei, and ambassadors from both states often visited the other. While there was no such formal arrangement with Western Wei, there appeared to be few border conflicts after this point. With Eastern Wei and Western Wei locked into war, Liang was largely at peace. With Zhou She having died in 524 and Xu Mian having died in 535, Emperor Wu largely entrusted the government to Zhu Yi and He Jingrong (‰ΩïÊï¨ÂÆπ). While He was known for integrity, he lacked political skills, and Zhu became the de facto prime minister, wielding great power and amassing wealth. While Zhu was skillful and capable, he was also regarded as corrupt and jealous of others. His hold on power was particularly increased when He was dismissed in 544 over a corruption scandal involving the brother of his concubine. In 539, based on Zhu's recommendation, Emperor Wu carried out a reorganization of the provincial divisions, placing the provinces into five classes based on their sizes and populations. After the reorganization, there were 108 provinces in total (20 of the first class, 10 of the second class, eight of the third class, 23 of the fourth class, and 21 of the fifth class), with the smaller provinces often consisting of single villages in southern and southwestern border regions. In 541, the Vietnamese people of Jiao Province (‰∫§Â∑û, roughly modern Hanoi, Vietnam), dissatisfied at the cruel rule of the governor Xiao Zi (Ëï≠Ë´Æ) the Marquess of Wulin (Emperor Wu's nephew), declared a rebellion, led by L√Ω B√¥n. The Liang forces could not put down L√Ω B√¥n's rebellion quickly, and L√Ω B√¥n eventually declared himself emperor of Vietnam in 544, fighting a guerilla war with Liang. Liang forces would not be driven out until 550. In 545, Emperor Wu's official He Chen (Ë≥ÄÁêõ) wrote a submission Emperor Wu to correct four matters‚Äîthe corruption of officials, the wastefulness in the luxurious style of living among officials and the population at large, the harshness of penal laws, and the overspending on construction projects (mostly temples). Emperor Wu was exceedingly angry and rejected He's suggestions. Commenting on this incident, the historian Sima Guang wrote the following about Emperor Wu: :The emperor was filially pious, loving, humble, frugal, knowledgeable, and good at writing. He extensively studied mysticism, astrology, horseriding, archery, music, calligraphy, and weiqi. He worked hard, and even in the coldest winter times, he would get up at the fourth watch [between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.] to review important matters of state, and as his pen-wielding hand is exposed to the cold air, his skin would break. Ever since the era of Tianjian [from 502 to 519], he became a Buddhist and ate only vegetarian meals, not meat, and his single daily meal only contained vegetables and rough rice grains. Sometimes, when he was busy, he would flush his mouth and no longer eat after noon. He wore cloth and used bed covers made of bombax ceiba. Each hat he wore, he would use for three years, and each comforter he used, he would use for two years. Within the palace, starting from Guifei [first-ranked consort], their skirts would not be long enough to reach the ground. The emperor disliked alcohol, and unless he was offering sacrifices to the ancestors, feasting with the imperial officials, or holding Buddhist ceremonies, he used no music. Even when he was alone in a dark room, he wore proper clothing and sat carefully. No matter how hot the weather was, he would not peel up his sleeves or expose his arms. He treated palace servants as honored guests. However, he was overly lenient to the officials. The provincial and commandery governors often extracted wealth from the people. The messengers that he sent out to the locales often improperly pressured, criticized, or extorted from the locales. He trusted evil people and liked to criticize people for minor faults. He built many Buddhist towers and temples, inflicting great burdens on the government and the people. The area south of the Yangtze River had long peace, and as a result became wasteful in lifestyle. All of what He Chen said was true, but it was particularly because what he said was true that the emperor became angry. In 546, Emperor Wu made his third offering of himself to the service of the Buddha. He spent more than a month at Tongtai Temple, before a fire that destroyed the temple tower caused him to return to the palace. The Hou Jing disturbance and death The tianlu for the imperial tomb of Xiao Yan In 547, Gao Huan died, and was succeeded as the paramount authority in Eastern Wei by his son Gao Cheng. The Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, because he disliked the young Gao Cheng and considered himself superior, rebelled. He first surrendered the 13 provinces that he was in charge‚Äîall south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River, to Western Wei, but believing that he would also not be tolerated by Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, Hou then surrendered nine of the 13 provinces (minus the four that he had turned over to Western Wei forces in exchange for help) to Liang. Emperor Wu initially hesitated himself at whether to accept Hou's surrender, particularly because a number of his officials, including Xie Ju (Ë¨ùËàâ), opposed, citing the long- standing peace with Eastern Wei. Zhu Yi, however, believing that approving of Hou's surrender would please Emperor Wu, argued that Hou should be accepted. Emperor Wu agreed, and he created Hou the Prince of He'nan, with acting imperial powers over the nine provinces. In the midst of this situation, Emperor Wu, while sending troops to aid Hou, offered himself to the service of the Buddha for the fourth time, spending 37 days at Tongtai Temple and only returning to the palace after his officials made another huge donation to Tongtai Temple. Hou, with aid from Western Wei and Liang, initially stood Eastern Wei attacks. However, when Yuwen subsequently demanded that he proceed to the Western Wei capital Chang'an to greet Emperor Wen of Western Wei, Hou turned against Western Wei forces commanded by Wang Sizheng (ÁéãÊÄùÊîø), although Western Wei largely held the cities that he had turned over. Meanwhile, Emperor Wu also commissioned a large army, commanded by his nephew Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, to attack Eastern Wei to the east. By Emperor Wu's orders, Xiao Yuanming advanced to Hanshan (ÂØíÂ±±), in Pengcheng's vicinity, to build a dam over the Si River (Ê≥óÊ∞¥) to use water to attack Pengcheng. Xiao Yuanming's lieutenant, the general Yang Kan (Áæä‰æÉ), quickly completed the dam, but when Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack Pengcheng, Xiao Yuanming hesitated. Meanwhile, Eastern Wei forces commanded by Murong Shaozong (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ¥πÂÆó) arrived near Hanshan, and Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack them while they were still tired, but Xiao Yuanming failed to. Subsequently, when the armies engaged, the Liang forces were initially successful, but overextended themselves, and the Eastern Wei counterattack nearly destroyed the entire Liang army, capturing Xiao Yuanming and many of his officers. Murong then turned his attention against Hou, meeting Hou at Woyang (Ê∏¶ÈôΩ, in modern Bozhou, Anhui). Initially, Hou defeated Murong in battle, forcing him to flee, but Murong then regrouped. Meanwhile, Hou's food supplies began to dwindle. In spring 548, Hou's troops collapsed, and he approached Shouyang. When the Wei An (ÈüãÈªØ), the acting governor of Southern Yu Province (ÂçóË±´Â∑û, modern central Anhui) welcomed Hou, Hou took him by surprise and seized Shouyang. He then sent an apology to Emperor Wu, and Emperor Wu, not having the heart of forcing Hou away from Shouyang, made him the governor of Southern Yu Province. With Eastern Wei having recovered all nine of the provinces that Hou had surrendered to Liang, Gao Cheng now sent overtures to Emperor Wu, requesting that peace be reinstated, offering to return Xiao Yuanming and Hou's relatives. Hou opposed peace, suspecting Gao Cheng's intentions, and he also did not trust Emperor Wu's subsequent guarantees never to betray him. Hou's fears were further increased when Emperor Wu sent ambassadors to mourn Gao Huan. Hou decided to test Emperor Wu by forging a letter from Gao Cheng, offering to swap Xiao Yuanming for Hou‚Äîand when Emperor Wu then responded, \\"If you return Yuanming in the morning, I will return Hou Jing in the evening\\" against the advice of Fu Qi (ÂÇÖÂ≤ê), Hou was outraged. Hou made an overture to Xiao Zhengde, promising to support him as the new emperor, and Xiao Zhengde agreed. Emperor Wu's nephew Xiao Fan (Ëï≠ÁØÑ) the Prince of Poyang, who believed that Hou was about to rebel, suggested a preemptory attack, but Zhu advised against it, and Emperor Wu took no action on Xiao Fan's recommendation. In summer 548, Hou finally declared a rebellion, claiming that his goal was to clear the court of evil officials‚ÄîZhu, Xu Lin (ÂæêÈ∫ü), Lu Yan (Èô∏È©ó), and Zhou Shizhen (Âë®Áü≥Áèç) -- all corrupt officials that the people hated. Initially, Emperor Wu did not take Hou's rebellion seriously, and he made the comment, \\"I can break off a tree branch and kill him with it.\\" He sent his son Xiao Guan (Ëï≠Á∂∏) the Prince of Shaoling to command a four-pronged army, intending to trap Hou at Shouyang, but Hou, taking decisive action, marched toward Jiankang before Xiao Guan's forces could converge, and within a month, he crossed the Yangtze and approached Jiankang, catching the city unprepared. When Emperor Wu sent Xiao Zhengde to resist Hou, Xiao Zhengde turned against Emperor Wu and served as Hou's guide. Hou quickly surrounded Jiankang, and the populace of Jiankang, unaccustomed to war, panicked and collapsed. Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang put together the imperial guards to defend the palace, and initially, the defenses held, particularly because the key general, Yang Kan, was capable. In winter 548, Hou had Xiao Zhengde declared emperor and married Xiao Zhengde's daughter. When Hou's forces began to run out of food supply, he allowed his soldiers to pillage from the people, and the people began to starve in large numbers. (In the siege, the vegetables that Emperor Wu was accustomed to eat ran out, and Emperor Wu became forced to eat eggs.) The provincial governors, led by Xiao Guan and Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, meanwhile, were beginning to put a relief force together, and Xiao Guan arrived around the new year 549, but was defeated by Hou and was unable to lift the siege. Meanwhile, Yang died, and the people inside the palace walls grew increasingly desperate. As the siege went on, however, more Liang provincial forces converged, and they supported Liu Zhongli (Êü≥‰ª≤Á¶Æ) the governor of Si Province (Âè∏Â∑û, modern southern Henan) as their commander. Liu initially had some successes against Hou's forces, but in spring 549, Hou made a surprise attack on Liu's forces, and both sides incurred heavy losses, with Liu himself nearly dying of his injuries‚Äîafter which, Liu became extremely hesitant to engage Hou. Liu grew very arrogant as well, even treating Xiao Guan was disrespect. Further, Liu's forces were pillaging the people as much as Hou's forces, and therefore the people saw no incentive to assist them. With Hou's forces tired, however, Hou sued for peace, stating that he was willing to return to Shouyang if Emperor Wu was willing to cede four provinces west of the Yangtze River to him and willing to send Xiao Gang's oldest son Xiao Daqi the Prince of Xuancheng as a hostage. Emperor Wu agreed‚Äîexcept for sending Xiao Daqi's younger brother Xiao Dakuan (Ëï≠Â§ßÊ¨æ) the Duke of Shicheng instead of Xiao Daqi. Once the relief forces withdrew slightly (under Hou's demand) and Hou's forces had rested about 15 days and obtained some additional food supplies, however, Hou changed his mind and decided not to withdraw after all. He resumed sieging the palace, and yet Liu took no actions. In late spring 549, the palace fell to Hou's troops, and Hou met Emperor Wu, initially acting as if he were willing to remain a faithful subject. Hou remained formally deferential to Emperor Wu and Xiao Gang the Crown Prince, but meanwhile effectively put them under house arrest. He issued an edict in Emperor Wu's name, disbanding Liu's forces, and Liu did so. Hou also deposed Xiao Zhengde. Meanwhile, Emperor Wu continued to resist some of Hou's demands, and when Hou requested that certain of his associates by named to high-level posts, Emperor Wu refused. Hou reacted by reducing Emperor Wu's supplies, and in summer 549, Emperor Wu died. (It is unclear whether he died from illness or from starvation.)

Through reciprocal bilateral projections from the retina, it is involved primarily in mediating behavioral responses to acute changes in ambient light such as the pupillary light reflex, the optokinetic reflex, and temporary changes to the circadian rhythm. In addition to the pretectum's role in the visual system, the anterior pretectal nucleus has been found to mediate somatosensory and nociceptive information. Location and structure The pretectum is a bilateral group of highly interconnected nuclei located near the junction of the midbrain and forebrain. The pretectum is generally classified as a midbrain structure, although because of its proximity to the forebrain it is sometimes classified as part of the caudal diencephalon (forebrain). Within vertebrates, the pretectum is located directly anterior to the superior colliculus and posterior to the thalamus. It is situated above the periaqueductal grey and nucleus of the posterior commissure. Several nuclei have been identified within the pretectum, although their borders can be difficult to define and there has been debate over which regions should be included and their precise names. The five primary nuclei are: the olivary pretectal nucleus (ON), the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), and the anterior (NPA), medial (NPM), and posterior (NPP) pretectal nuclei. The NOT consists of relatively large cells and is located between the superior colliculi. The ON is located medial to the NOT and has a tail that extends between the NOT and NPP, which is ventral to the ON. Two additional nuclei have also been identified: the posterior limitans (PLi) and the commisural pretectal area (CPA). While these two regions have not been examined to the same extent as the five primary nuclei, research has shown both the PLi and CPA to receive retinal input, which suggests a role in processing visual information. Inputs The pretectum receives significant binocular input from photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. In primates these afferents are bilateral while in rodents they project from the contralateral retina. The majority of these retino-pretectal projections go to the ON and NOT while other pretectal nuclei receive minor retinal input in mammals including the posterior, medial, and anterior pretectal nuclei. The NOT receives input from several regions. From the thalamus the NOT receives inhibitory projections from GABA-producing neurons in the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus and bilateral intergeniculate leaflets. The ipsilateral superficial suprachiasmatic nucleus and the medial, dorsal, and lateral terminal nuclei in the midbrain project onto the NOT. Fibers also project to the NOT from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in the medulla, the contralateral NOT, and from various cortical regions. Outputs Many pretectal nuclei share targets of efferent projections. All pretectal nuclei, except for the ON, project to nuclei in the thalamus, subthalamus, superior colliculus, reticular formation, pons, and inferior olive. Both the ON and the CPA have efferent projections to the Edinger- Westphal nucleus. The NPP and NPA both project to the pulvinar, the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and several precerebellar nuclei. The NOT has efferent projections to the zona incerta of the subthalamus, several nuclei of the pons, medulla, intralaminar nuclei, midbrain, and dorsal and ventral thalamic nuclei. Its bilateral inhibitory projections to the accessory optic system include connections to the lateral and medial terminal nuclei. Projections to the subthalamus are target toward the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. The NOT projects bilaterally to the superior colliculus, although the ipsilateral connections appear to be more dominant. In addition to these projections, the NOT projects to the vestibular and vestibulocerebellar relay nuclei.  Function  As part of the subcortical visual system, neurons within the pretectal nuclei respond to varying intensities of illuminance and are primarily involved in mediating non- conscious behavioral responses to acute changes in light. In general, these responses involve the initiation of optokinetic reflexes, although the pretectum can also regulate nociception and REM sleep. Pupillary light reflex Pupillary constriction resulting from the pupillary light reflex is mediated by the olivary and posterior pretectal nuclei. The pupillary light reflex is mediated by the pretectum. This reflex is responsible for the constriction of the pupils upon light's entering the eye. Several pretectal nuclei, in particular the ON, receive illuminance information from the ipsilateral retina via the optic tract. Nuclei in the ON are known to gradually increase in activation in response to increasing levels of illuminance. This information is then relayed directly to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which proceeds to relay the command to constrict the pupils to the pupillary sphincter via the ciliary ganglion. Smooth pursuit Pretectal nuclei, in particular the NOT, are involved in coordinating eye movements during smooth pursuit. These movements allow the eye to closely follow a moving object and to catch up to an object after an unexpected change in direction or velocity. Direction-sensitive retinal slip neurons within the NOT provide ipsiversive horizontal retinal error information to the cortex through the inferior olive. During the day, this information is sensed and relayed by neurons with large receptive fields, whereas parafoveal neurons with small receptive fields do so in the dark. It is through this pathway that the NOT is able to provide retinal error information to guide eye movements. In addition to its role in maintaining smooth pursuit, the pretectum is activated during the optokinetic nystagmus in which the eye returns to a central, forward- facing position after an object it was following passes out of the field of vision. Accommodation reflex Part of the pretectum, particularly the NOT and NPP, are implicated in the accommodation reflex by which the eye maintains focus. Proprioceptive information from the retina reaches the pretectum via the occulomotor nerve and the trigeminal nerve. From that point, the mechanism by which the eye maintains focus through muscular contractions of the retina is similar to that of the pupillary light reflex. Antinociception The NPA participates in the active diminishing of the perception of pain stimuli (antinociception). Although the mechanism by which the NPA alters an organism's response to painful stimuli is not fully known, research has shown that activity in the ventral NPA triggers cholinergic and serotonergic neurons. These neurons activate descending pathways that synapse in the spinal cord and inhibit nociceptive cells in the dorsal horn. In addition to its direct antionociceptive mechanism, the NPA projects onto brain regions that, through connections to the somatosensory cortex, regulate the perception of painful stimuli. Two of these regions that the NPA is known to project to are the zona incerta and posterior thalamic nucleus. Regions of the NPA may be specialized to respond to different types of pain. Research has found that the dorsal NPA best diminished the perception of brief pain whereas the ventral NPA reduced the perception of chronic pain. Because of its role in the reduction of chronic pain, abnormal activity of the NPA is thought to be implicated in central pain syndrome. REM sleep Multiple pretectal nuclei may be involved in regulating REM sleep and sleep behaviors. Research has shown that the pretectum, in conjunction with the superior colliculus, may be responsible for causing non-circadian changes in REM sleep behaviors. Pretectal nuclei receiving retinal input, in particular the NOT and the NPP, have been shown to be partially responsible for initiating REM sleep in albino rats. The discovery of projections from the pretectum to several thalamic nuclei involved in cortical activation during REM sleep, to be specific the projection to the superchiasmatic nucleus, which is part of a known REM sleep regulatory mechanism, supports this hypothesis.

The caverns were formed from the erosion of large limestone deposits over millions of years. Pre-Columbian Native American artifacts have been found in the caverns. Currently the cavern system is a tourist attraction, with more than fifty billboards along Interstate 44 and is considered one of the primary attractions along former U.S. Highway 66. Meramec Caverns is the most-visited cave in Missouri with some 150,000 visitors annually. Meramec Caverns is ranked #178 on CaverBob.com's USA Long Cave list.  History  The Meramec Caverns have existed for the past 400 million years, slowly forming through deposits of limestone. In centuries past, Native Americans used the cavern system for shelter. The first cave west of the Mississippi River to be explored by Europeans, it was first visited in 1722 by a French miner. Meramec Caverns was a station on the Underground Railroad. Thousands of runaway slaves were reportedly housed there.Daily Standard, Sikeston, MO, December 14, 1961, p 5, available on Newspapers.com During the 18th century, the cave was used for extracting saltpeter for the manufacture of gunpowder. In the Civil War era, the Union Army used the caves as a saltpeter plant, but the plant was discovered and destroyed by Confederate guerrillas, likely including the future infamous outlaw Jesse James. According to local legend, James and his brother and partner in crime Frank used the caves as a hideout in the 1870s. However, there is scant historical evidence to support this tradition. One legend in particular claims that a sheriff tracking the Jameses sat in front of the cave, waiting for Jesse and his gang to emerge; however, they had found another exit. In 1933, the extended cave system was discovered, revealing the present , and was introduced to the public as a tourist attraction in 1935 by Lester B. Dill, who invented the bumper sticker as a means of promoting the caverns. In 1960, Meramec Caverns rented billboard space in the caverns. The owners claimed this was the only underground billboard in the world. In midsummer of 1972, Meramec Caverns provided the cave settings for Tom Sawyer, a musical film which was released to theaters that following year. In the 1998 movie Deep Impact (film) a reference is made to the limestone caves of Missouri as the location of the ARC shelter. Noted attractions=Wine Room Wine Room The fifth level of Meramec Caverns includes a \\"Wine Room.\\" The Wine Room is home to the world's rarest cave formation, The Wine Table. The onyx table stands six feet high and is supported on three natural legs. Known as an aragonite formation, this structure was composed almost entirely underwater. The Wine Room and the Wine Table are adorned with grape-like clusters called botryoids. Originally called the Wine Room because of these grape clusters, the cave now claims that it is called that because of the \\"whining\\" that visitors do when they learn that the room is accessible only after climbing numerous stairs (a total of 58 steps). \\"Greatest Show Under the Earth\\" Greatest Show Under the Earth The Cavern also contains a massive sheet wall of formations formed during the past several thousand years, which the cave calls its \\"stage curtain\\" and which is also used for displaying the light and sound show called \\"Greatest Show Under the Earth\\". \\"Hollywood\\" A room within the cavern was used for Hollywood productions, most notably Tom Sawyer (1973). In the particular movie, the site was used as the cave system where Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) and Becky Thatcher (Jodie Foster) got lost in a cave, as well as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East) find the hidden gold. An episode of Lassie was also filmed in this part of the cave. Mirror Room The Mirror Room is a room within the cavern that contains a stream of water about deep. However, when a group of lights are turned on, the depth of the water is perceived by many to be as great as , due to the reflection of the cavern's roof on the undisturbed water. Ballroom First used in 1890, The Ballroom is a room in the cavern system that was used in earlier times as a room for square dances and other community events. It is now one of the first stops on the tour and is used for a few annual concerts by the Lester Family.

History The greater part of the province is uninhabitable sand dune fields (ergs), in particular the Great Western Erg and the Erg Er Raoui, or dry plains (hamadas) suitable for grazing but with insufficient surface water to support agriculture. Most settlements are therefore concentrated in oases along the Saoura valley and its tributaries. An aquifer under the Erg Er Raoui supports the main exception, Tabelbala. Natural resources include coal deposits in the north around Bechar and Kenadsa and copper in the south in Djebel Ben Tagine. The oases' traditional economic basis was agriculture, notably growing date palms and grain. The inhabitants of several oases, notably Igli, Ouakda, Lahmar and Boukais, speak Berber languages, while the rest speak Arabic; in one oasis, Tabelbala, a Songhay language, Korandje, continues to be spoken. Many of the oases had significant populations of haratin or shurfa. There are notable zaouias, traditional religious schools, at Kenadsa and Kerzaz. The region also supported a substantial mainly Arab pastoralist nomadic population, notably the Doui- Menia, Ouled Djerir, Ghenanma, Chaamba, and Reguibat; some of these still remain nomadic, but most have settled in the oases. Trans-Saharan trade routes passing through this region played an important role in its economy in pre- modern times, but have at present been superseded. A small tourism industry exists, focused particularly on Taghit. B√©char, whose growth from a minor village began only in the early 20th century, has become the principal urban and administrative centre. The region has a distinctive musical scene influenced by sub-Saharan African rhythms, whose best known representative is the Gnawi singer Hasna El Becharia. Another locally well-known group is El Sed, from Kenadsa. Disagreements between Morocco and Algeria over their mutual border in this province and Tindouf led to conflict after Algeria's independence, the so-called Sand War.

At one time, it was a mostly self-contained rural community at the junction of two significant rail lines, part of the Township of Humberstone, and was called Welland Junction. The name was changed to Dain City after it was annexed to the city of Welland in the mid-1950s. Dain City was built for, and by, the Marshall Dain Manufacturing Company (Now known as John Deere), the area's main employer, as a \\"company town\\". In September 2008, John Deere announced it would be close its plant with a loss of 800 jobs and relocate to Wisconsin and Mexico by the end of 2009. The geography and character of Dain City is largely a factor of its proximity to the Welland Canal, the only shipping channel between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the Great Lakes system. For many years, the canal ran along Dain City's western side and through the city of Welland itself, with numerous bends and bridges along the way. Those included two lift bridges in Dain City, However, in April 2019, The Forks Road Bridge (Bridge 18.) was removed, Only the Train Bridge (Bridge 17) Remains. The completion of the Welland By-Pass in 1973, a massive six-year excavation project to by-pass the whole city of Welland with a wider and straighter channel, significantly altered and isolated Dain City, turning it into a peninsula with the new canal on its eastern side and the old and new canals meeting at its southern tip. Dain City's lift bridge's lift capabilities were removed in the 1980s, although it is still in use by vehicular traffic. Notably, Dain City was once home to a large drive-in theater, the Welland Drive-In, located on the south side of Forks Road between the old rail line and the new canal, constructed in 1954 and torn down in 1981. Dain City contains four housing subdivisions: \\"Glennwood Park\\", \\"Regatta Park\\", \\"Seaway Village\\", and \\"Welland Junction\\". The old canal, renamed the Welland Recreational Waterway, hosts international rowing regattas and dragon boat races annually, and also the South Niagara Rowing Club, which is affiliated with area high schools.  Geography  Dain City, in the south of the city of Welland where the Welland Recreational Waterway and the Welland By-Pass meet, is separated by the massive approaches to the Townline Tunnel required to provide the low grade for the rail lines that use the tunnel. Technically, both the east side of Welland and Dain City are peninsulas, surrounded by the waters of the old and new channels of the Welland Canal and connected to \\"solid\\" ground only by the relatively small plug in the old canal along the Townline Tunnel approaches.

It was named after its eponymous capital. Notable towns include El Oued itself and El M'Ghair, Djamaa and Guemar. Geography=Physical geography El Oued Province lies in the Sahara desert in northeast Algeria. The mostly uninhabited southern half of the province is covered by the Grand Erg Oriental, a vast region of uninterrupted sand dunes. The northern half of the province is a mixture of sandy desert with scarce vegetation, scattered oases, and salt lakes. The most notable oases are the Oued Souf region, upon which the capital El Oued and neighbouring towns are built, as well as oases located near the towns of El M'Ghair and Djamaa, both of which support extensive palm plantations. Chott Melrhir, a large endorheic salt lake, lies in the north- central part of the province, while Chott Felrhir is a smaller salt lake to its southwest, near El M'Ghair. These salt lakes, and the surrounding areas, lie as much as below sea level; nearby towns and villages including Hamraia, M√©guibra, Dendouga and A√Øn Cheikh are also below sea level. Climate El Oued Province experiences a hot desert climate. Winters are mild, with average temperatures around in January, but summers are hot with average temperatures around , average maxima around and the hottest days approaching . Precipitation is very low throughout the province, but somewhat more rain does fall in the north, particularly during the winter and adjacent months.

Traditionally, he was considered the last emperor of the dynasty because he was the one who formally yielded the throne to the founding emperor to the succeeding Tang Dynasty, Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan), although after him, his brother Yang Tong claimed the throne and continued to do so until 619. Li had rebelled against the rule of Yang You's grandfather Emperor Yang of Sui in 617 and captured the capital Chang'an later that year, seizing Yang You and declaring him emperor, although only the commanderies under Li's control recognized him as emperor; the rest of the commanderies continued to recognize Emperor Yang as emperor. In 618, after news arrived that Emperor Yang had been killed by the general Yuwen Huaji, Li had the young emperor yield the throne to him. The former emperor died the following year, probably on the new emperor's orders.  During Emperor Yang's reign  Yang You was born in 605, as a son of Yang Zhao, the son and crown prince of Emperor Yang. His mother was Yang Zhao's wife, Crown Princess Wei. He was probably the youngest of Yang Zhao's three sons‚Äîhe was clearly younger than Yang Tan (), born in 603, and probably younger than Yang Tong, whose birth year is unknown, based the order in which they were eventually created imperial princes. However, under Confucian principles of succession, he would have been considered Yang Zhao's proper heir, as his mother was Yang Zhao's wife, while Yang Tan's and Yang Tong's mothers were concubines. Yang Zhao died in 606. However, Emperor Yang did not create Yang You or either of his brothers crown prince to replace Yang Zhao, leaving matters ambiguous as to whether one of them, or Yang Zhao's younger brother Yang Jian the Prince of Qi, would inherit the throne eventually. He created the three sons of Yang Zhao imperial princes, and Yang You received the title of Prince of Dai.The Book of Sui, in the biography of Emperor Yang's sons and grandsons, stated that he was initially created the Prince of Chen and then had his title changed later to Prince of Dai, but in Emperor Yang's biography stated that Yang You was initially already created the Prince of Dai. As Emperor Yang did not often stay in the capital Chang'an, starting 613, he made the eight-year-old Yang You nominally in charge of Chang'an, although he left the official Wei Wensheng () in actual charge of the city. Later that year, when the general Yang Xuangan rebelled and attacked the eastern capital Luoyang, it was Wei who led troops from Chang'an to aid Luoyang's defenses. In 617, the general Li Yuan, fearful of Emperor Yang because Emperor Yang had become displeased with him over his inability to defend against Tujue attacks and suspicious of him after there had been prophecies that the next emperor would be named Li, rebelled at his headquarters at Taiyuan (Â§™Âéü, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li, wanting to both distance himself from Emperor Yang while declaring to the Sui forces that he was still loyal to Sui, claimed that his goal was to support Yang You as emperor and to persuade Yang Guang to return from Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). Li proceeded quickly to Chang'an, and during Li's campaign, Wei died. Wei's lieutenants Yin Shishi () and Gu Yi () were left in charge of the city and guardianship over Yang You. In winter 617, Li's forces breached Chang'an's defenses. Li took Yang You and declared him emperor (as Emperor Gong), remotely offering Emperor Yang the title of Taishang Huang, but only territory under Li's control recognized Yang You as emperor.  Reign  Map showing major uprisings and rebellions in the last years of Sui dynasty. Yang You's reign was based in Chang'an. While Emperor Gong was emperor, the real power was in Li Yuan's hands, and Li had Emperor Gong make him the Prince of Tang. Quickly, the surrounding commanderies, including most of modern Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing, submitted to Li. With Luoyang under attack by the rebel leader Li Mi, in spring 618, Li sent troops commanded by his sons Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin there, claiming to be aiding the defense. The Sui forces at Luoyang refused to recognize Li's authority and made no contact with Li Jiancheng's and Li Shimin's forces, which withdrew after brief engagement with Li Mi's forces. In summer 618, just six months after Emperor Gong took imperial title, Li Yuan had Emperor Gong pass the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu.  After reign  The new emperor created the former emperor the Duke of Xi. The duke died in fall 619, and while traditional histories did not directly state so, they implied that he was killed on the Tang emperor's orders. He had no sons, and his title was inherited by a distant nephew, Yang Xingji ().

Khenchela in winter History Statue of Queen Kahina in Baghai, Khenchela province. Queen Kahina led a decades long war against the Islamic conquest in the 7th century, and she built a castle here. During the Barbary period there were many inter town conflict over water resources. The French army reached Khenchela in 1850 after heavy fighting and more strenuous resistance and set up a military administration. Organization of work of the city were undertaken. The first French settlers were allowed from 1878. Farms were built and they made plantations. In doing so, the farmers cleared a path for vegetation at the valley of Wadi Boughegal which in turn gave birth to natural grasslands, allowing cattle breeding and feeding the population with fresh dairy products (i.e. milk, butter, cheese). In October 1905, the inauguration of the line of Railway Ain Beida in Khenchela meter gauge will provide a daily service with the North. Military administration lasted until 1912. In 1982, a mass grave containing more than 1200 corpses from the war of Algeria is discovered. It would be the largest ever discovered in Algeria.

This increase is partly explained by population displacement during the war in Algeria, the area being a refuge for resistance fighters.

During the first period, he did not rule, and the entire government was in the hands of his mother, Empress Wu Zetian and was effectively overthrown by her real power after opposing his mother. In the second period, most of the government was in the hands of his beloved wife Empress Wei. Emperor Zhongzong was the son of Emperor Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), and during the reign of his father the real power was completely controlled by Empress Wu. He succeeded his father in 684, But as emperor, he has very much little ruling and true power, and all affairs and power remained in the hands of his mother, Empress Dowager Wu. His mother, however, deposed him less than two months later in favor of his younger brother Emperor Ruizong. The former emperor, demoted to a princely rank, was sent in exile in the provinces and placed under house arrest. Six years later, Emperor Ruizong in turn relinquished the throne to his mother and Empress Dowager Wu officially proclaimed herself empress regnant, while Emperor Ruizong was made crown prince. By 698 the court was caught in the middle of a bitter power struggle. In an attempt to secure her prominence, Empress Wu liberated the former emperor from his 14 years of seclusion and recalled him to the capital in April 698. He was reinstated as crown prince in October 698, taking the place of his brother. On 20 February 705, a palace coup deposed Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong was restored as emperor three days later. Emperor Zhongzong reigned for five years but was a rather weak and easily influenced ruler. Real power was in the hands of his empress consort, Empress Wei and her lover Wu Sansi (Wu Zetian's nephew) and his daughter Li Guo'er, the Princess Anle. In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei, who then installed his son, Li Chongmao, as Emperor Shang. Empress Wei, who had failed to install her daughter Li Guo'er, the Princess Anle, as heir to Emperor Zhongzong, thought that Li Chongmao, born of Zhongzong and a concubine and who was only 16 years old, would be easy to control and allow her to preserve her power. The scheme failed, however, when Princess Taiping, the sister of Emperor Zhongzong, launched a coup two weeks later with her nephew Li Longji (later Emperor Xuanzong), son of the abdicated Emperor Ruizong, and overthrew Empress Wei and the young emperor. Emperor Ruizong, the father of Li Longji and the older brother of Princess Taiping, was restored as emperor. Background Li Xi«énTonal signs for his original name are used in this section only to disambiguate between him and his brother Li Xi√°n. was born in 656, as the seventh son of his father Emperor Gaozong and the third son of his mother, Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). In 657, he was created the Prince of Zhou and nominally made the prefect of the eastern capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (Ê¥õÂ∑û, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan). In 661, when his older brother Li Xi√°n the Prince of Pei had the literarily-talented official Wang Bo on staff, the princes were apparently often engaged in cockfighting. Wang Bo wrote a playful piece entitled the Declaration Against the Prince of Zhou's Cock (), which, however, when Emperor Gaozong read it, caused Emperor Gaozong to be angry, as he believed this would cause discord between his sons, and therefore expelled Wang from the Pei mansion. However, in 674, a similar incident happened by Emperor Gaozong's own instigation‚Äîas, at an imperial feast, he divided the imperial musicians into two teams and had Li Xi√°n and Li Xi«én lead the two teams in competition‚Äîalthough he stopped when the chancellor Hao Chujun pointed out the potential for rivalry. Meanwhile, during the years that Li Xi«én was the Prince of Zhou, he had married a daughter of his grandaunt the Princess Changle and her husband, the general Zhao Gui (), as his wife and princess. Emperor Gaozong had often shown favors to Princess Changle, and this displeased Empress Wu. In 675, on account of this, she had Princess Zhao accused of crimes and put into solitary confinement at the bureau of eunuchs. She was given raw vegetables and raw meat for her to cook them herself. However, sometime later, the kitchen stopped to have smoke and steam come out of it, and when Empress Wu had her confinement house opened, Princess Zhao was seen dead inside, having starved to death. Empress Wu also demoted Zhao Gui to be the prefect of Kuo Prefecture (Êã¨Â∑û, roughly modern Lishui, Zhejiang) and ordered Princess Changle to accompany her husband to Kuo Prefecture, and further ordered that neither Zhao Gui nor Princess Changle would be allowed to enter the palace. In 676, when the Tibetan Empire attacked Tang's western prefectures, Li Xi«én and his younger brother Li Lun, the Prince of Xiang, were nominally put in charge of the two armies that were actually commanded by the generals Liu Shenli () and Qibi Heli (), but neither Li Xi«én nor Li Lun actually set out with the troops. In 677, Li Xi«én had his title changed to Prince of Ying. His name was also changed to Li Zhe. He was also made the prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). By 680, Li Xi√°n, who was then crown prince, had lost Empress Wu's favor. After she suspected him of having had her trusted sorcerer Ming Chongyan () assassinated, she had him investigated for treason, and subsequently, he was found guilty. He was reduced to commoner rank and exiled, and Li Zhe was created crown prince to replace him. Hao Chujun and another chancellor, Liu Rengui, were made his senior advisors. Emperor Gaozong also recruited the famed hermit scholar Tian Youyan () to serve as an advisor, although Tian would later draw criticism from others for not having any actual good advice for the crown prince. First stint as crown prince In 681, after Emperor Gaozong had become ill after consuming pills made by alchemists, he had Li Zhe briefly exercise imperial powers. In 682, Li Zhe's second wife, Crown Princess Wei, gave birth to a son, Li Chongzhao. Emperor Gaozong was pleased, and he created Li Chongzhao the unprecedented title of \\"Deputy Crown Prince\\" (ÁöáÂ§™Â≠´, Huang Taisun). Later that year, due to a famine in the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around the capital Chang'an), Emperor Gaozong took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang, leaving Li Zhe in charge of Chang'an, assisted by the chancellors Liu Rengui, Pei Yan, and Xue Yuanchao. it was said that while Li Zhe was in charge of Chang'an, he often spent his time on games and hunting, and Xue often advised him against spending time in this manner. When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he rewarded Xue and summoned Xue to Luoyang. In 683, Emperor Gaozong became ill at Luoyang, and he summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang, leaving Li Chongrun nominally in charge of Chang'an, assisted by Liu.The Zizhi Tongjian indicated that the son of Li Zhe left nominally in charge of Chang'an was Li Chongfu the Prince of Tangchang. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 203. However, both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that it was Li Chongzhao who was left in charge, and as Li Chongzhao's position was higher than Li Chongfu's, it appeared more likely that Li Chongzhao was in charge. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 84, and New Book of Tang, vol. 180. The Old Book of Tang did, elsewhere, indicate that Li Chongfu, not Li Chongzhao, was nominally in charge. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 5 After Li Zhe arrived at Luoyang, Emperor Gaozong transferred imperial powers to him, and soon died. Li Zhe took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but actual powers were entire in the hands of Empress Wu, now empress dowager and regent. First reign: under Empress Dowager Wu's regency and dethronement Emperor Zhongzong, in spring 684, made his wife, Crown Princess Wei, empress consort, and he wanted to make his father-in-law, Wei Xuanzhen () Shizhong () ‚Äì the head of the examination bureau of government and a post considered one for a chancellor. He also wanted to make the son of his wet nurse an official of the fifth rank. Pei Yan resisted both commissions. As they argued, Emperor Zhongzong, in anger, remarked, \\"What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen? Why do you care about Shizhong so much? [Ë≥áÊ≤ªÈÄöÈëë/Âç∑203vol. 203, p. 6417] Pei, in fear, informed Empress Dowager Wu. Just less than two months after Emperor Zhongzong had taken the throne, Empress Dowager Wu summoned the officials and generals and issued an edict deposing Emperor Zhongzong and reducing to the title of Prince of Luling. As generals loyal to her physically removed Emperor Zhongzong from the throne, he struggled and asked, \\"What crime have I committed?\\" Empress Dowager Wu responded, \\"You wanted to give the empire to Wei Xuanzhen. How can that not be a crime?\\" She had him put under arrest and reduced him to the rank of Prince of Luling, and she made Li Lun (now named Li Dan) the Prince of Yu the new emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Li Chongzhao was reduced to commoner rank. In exile Empress Dowager Wu soon ordered that Li Zhe and his family first be delivered to Fang Prefecture (ÊàøÂ∑û, in modern Shiyan, Hubei), and then Jun Prefecture (ÂùáÂ∑û, also in modern Shiyan), to be held under house arrest at the house that his uncle Li Tai had been placed after Li Tai was deposed in 643. (Subsequently, in 685, he was moved back to Fang Prefecture.) On the way to exile, Princess Wei gave birth to a daughter. There was nothing to wrap the baby with, so Li Zhe took off his own shirt and wrapped the baby in it. To commemorate this, the daughter was subsequently named Li Guo'er (Guo'er meaning \\"the child that was wrapped\\"). Li Zhe and Princess Wei both greatly favored this child born in distress. Li Zhe was constantly in fear in exile, as Empress Dowager Wu had previously shown willingness to kill her own children‚Äîhaving forced Li Xi√°n to commit suicide in 684 and having been rumored to have poisoned another son, Li Hong, in 675‚Äîand whenever there would be imperial messengers arriving from then-capital Luoyang, he would consider committing suicide, fearing that they brought orders for even worse fates. Princess Wei would repeatedly tell him: At this point, they were deeply in love with each other, and at another point, he told her: While Li Zhe was in exile, people who rebelled against or plotted against Empress Dowager Wu often used him as a symbol of their resistance. For example, when Li Jingye the Duke of Ying rose against Empress Dowager Wu later in 684, he declared that his goal was to restore Li Zhe. Other examples included Yang Chucheng () in 687 and Li Yin () the Duke of Poyang (Emperor Gaozong's cousin) in 689. In 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \\"empress regnant\\" of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang. She created Emperor Ruizong crown prince with the unusual title Huangsi (), and initially, Li Zhe's status was not changed. Second stint as crown prince In the reign of his mother Wu Zetian In 697, during a major Khitan incursion, led by the khan Sun Wanrong, Sun issued a declaration questioning why Wu Zetian was keeping Li Zhe in exile. Thereafter, the chancellor Di Renjie often counseled Wu Zetian to recall Li Zhe, which fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan also agreed with. Further, Wu Zetian's close associate Ji Xu also advocated it and further persuaded her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong to advocate the same. Wu Zetian finally agreed, and in 698 recalled Li Zhe and his family back to Luoyang, then capital. Shortly thereafter, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian agreed, creating Li Zhe crown prince, demoting Li Dan to the rank of Prince of Xiang. She also changed his name back to Li Xi«én, and subsequently changed his surname to Wu. Subsequently, when she named him the nominal commander of the forces defending against a major G√∂kt√ºrk incursion, it was said that as soon as he was named the commander, men swarmed to enlist. In 699, fearing that after her death the Li and Wu clans would not be able to keep peace with each other, Wu Zetian had Li Xi«én, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, and her husband Wu Youji (Wu Zetian's nephew) swear an oath to each other. In 701, Li Chongzhao (now named Li Chongrun to observe naming taboo for Wu Zetian (whose personal name was Wu Zhao) and now carrying the title of Prince of Shao), Li Zhe's daughter Li Xianhui the Princess Yongtai, and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji () the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew), were accused of secretly disparaging Wu Zetian's relationships with Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong. In anger, Wu Zetian ordered the three of them to commit suicide.The Zizhi Tongjian asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders. Compare Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 207, with Old Book of Tang, vol. 86 and New Book of Tang, vol. 81. The Old Book of Tang, meanwhile, inconsistently asserted in the chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign that he was forced to commit suicide. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 6. The chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign in the New Book of Tang merely stated that the three of them \\"were killed.\\" See New Book of Tang, vol. 4However, some modern historians, based on the text on Li Xianhui's tombstone (written after Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne in 705), which suggested that she died the day after her brother and her husband and that she was pregnant at death, and the fact that the skeleton believed to be hers had a small pelvis, have proposed the theory that she was not ordered to commit suicide, but had, in grief over her brother's and husband's deaths, had either a miscarriage or a difficult birth and died from that. See, e.g., illustrations preceding the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 49. It may be notable that the Chinese Wikipedia article for Li Xianhui gave the text for her tombstone, but did not give an external link corroborating the text in the article. In spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill, and Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were attending to her and, at her direction, handling the major affairs of state, and there were rumors that they were seeking to displace Li Xi«én. The chancellors Zhang Jianzhi and Cui Xuanwei, along with other officials Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji plotted to overthrow her and the Zhang brothers. They persuaded the generals Li Duozuo and Li Dan (ÊùéÊπõ, note different character than the Prince of Xiang) to join the plot. With agreement from Li Xi«én as well, the coup leaders acted on 20 February,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and then surrounding Wu Zetian. She, in fear, asked, \\"Who is disturbing me?\\" Zhang Jianzhi responded, in a formalistic manner: Wu Zetian subsequently tried to have Li Xi«én returned to the palace of the Crown Prince, but the coup leaders ignored her. While the coup leaders allowed Wu Zetian to retain the title of \\"emperor,\\" they had her put under house arrest at the secondary palace Shangyang Palace () and forced her to yield the throne to Li Xi«én, who was formerly emperor, and he was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Second reign: under Empress Wei's shadow Once restored, Emperor Zhongzong initially put the five coup leaders in prominent positions. However, Empress Wei, once restored, became the most powerful and dominant figure at court, along with Li Guo'er, who now carried the title of Princess Anle And from now on he set up a faction to run the country. Also powerful was Wu Zetian's secretary Shangguan Wan'er, whom Emperor Zhongzong took as a concubine, who was also having an affair with Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang. Under her introduction, Empress Wei and Wu Sansi also soon started having an affair. With Consort Shangguan's and Empress Wei's influence, Wu Sansi became a powerful and trusted advisor to Emperor Zhongzong. Meanwhile, Empress Wei, disliking Emperor Zhongzong's oldest surviving son Li Chongfu the Prince of Qiao (born of a concubine), falsely accused Li Chongfu of being complicit in Li Chongrun's death. Emperor Zhongzong demoted Li Chongfu out of the capital to serve as a prefectural prefect, under heavy guard. Emperor Zhongzong initially offered the crown prince position to Li Dan, but after Li Dan declined, created another son by a concubine, Li Chongjun, crown prince. The coup leaders, meanwhile, were trying to curb Wu Sansi's rise, but in turn, Wu Sansi and Empress Wei repeatedly warned Emperor Zhongzong that the coup leaders were overly powerful and dangerous. In fall 705, Emperor Zhongzong agreed, and created the coup leaders princes under guise of honoring them, but removed them from their chancellor positions. In winter 705, Wu Zetian died. Her \\"emperor\\" title was subsequently removed and empress title restored, and Emperor Zhongzong buried her at Qianling, with his father Emperor Gaozong. (Also buried there were Emperor Zhongzong's brother Li Xi√°n, Li Chongrun, and Li Xianhui.) In spring 706, after Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (ÁéãÂêåÁöé, husband of Princess Ding'an), who despised Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, was accused of plotting to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei, Wang and his alleged coconspirators were executed, and subsequently, Wu Sansi and his associates accused Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, Zhang Jianzhi, Yuan Shuji, and Cui Xuanwei of being complicit in Wang's plot. The five princes were exiled and subsequently died or were killed in exile. In 707, Li Chongjun, angry that Li Guo'er and her husband Wu Chongxun (Ê≠¶Â¥áË®ì, Wu Sansi's son) had repeatedly humiliated him and tried to get Li Guo'er created crown princess to displace him, rose in rebellion with Li Duozuo and the generals Li Sichong (), Li Chengkuang (), Dugu Yizhi (), and Shazha Zhongyi (), along with Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Li Qianli () the Prince of Cheng and Li Qianli's son LI Xi () the Prince of Tianshui. They attacked Wu Sansi's mansion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun, and then marched on to the palace, trying to seize Consort Shangguan, Empress Wei, and Li Guo'er. The rebels hesitated at attacking the palace, and the imperial guards fought back. After the eunuch Yang Sixu () killed Li Duozuo's son-in- law Ye Huli (), and Emperor Zhongzong made a personal appeal to the coup forces, the coup forces turned against Li Chongjun, killing the generals commanding them. Li Chongjun fled but was killed in exile. Subsequently, the senior chancellor Wei Yuanzhong, whose son Wei Sheng () had been forced to join the rebellion, was exiled and killed in exile at the instigation of two chancellors aligned with Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, Zong Chuke and Ji Chuna. However, attempts by Empress Wei's party to implicate Li Dan and Princess Taiping were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the court was dominated by a number of powerful women, including Li Guo'er, Princess Changning (Emperor Zhongzong's and Empress Wei's older daughter), Empress Wei's sister Lady of Cheng, Consort Shangguan, Consort Shangguan's mother Lady Zheng of Pei, senior ladies in waiting Chai and Helou, the sorceress Diwu Ying'er (), and Lady Zhao of Longxi. These women were openly accepting bribes, and were able to recommend a number of people to be officials, directly commissioned by Emperor Zhongzong without approval from the legislative (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and examination (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) bureaus. The civil service system was said to be overrun with corruption and running into near collapse. In winter 708, after the Tuqishi () chieftain Suoge (), who had just succeeded his father Wuzhile (), was challenged by Wuzhile's subordinate Juechuo Zhongjie (),The New Book of Tang, followed by the Zizhi Tongjian, referred to this person as Juechuo Zhongjie, but the Old Book of Tang referred to him as Ashina Zhongjie (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£Âø†ÁØÄ). Juechuo, who was unable to prevail over Suoge, bribed Zong and Ji to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to prepare a joint attack against Tuqishi with the Tibetan Empire, despite counsel by the general Guo Yuanzhen against it. When Suoge heard this, he launched an attack preemptively, attacking several key Tang garrisons, capturing Juechuo, and killing the Tang general Feng Jiabin (), who had been sent to assist Juechuo. Subsequently, after Emperor Zhongzong recognized Suoge's authority over the Tuqishi tribes, hostility ceased, and Suoge again became a Tang vassal. In spring 710, Emperor Zhongzong sent Princess Jincheng, the daughter of his nephew Li Shouli the Prince of Yong (Li Xi√°n's son), to the Tibetan Empire to be married to its emperor, Me Agtsom, cementing peace between the two states. In Fiction & Popular Culture *Portrayed by Raymond Cho in The Greatness of a Hero (2009). Death Meanwhile, there had been accusations made by individuals such as Lang Ji () and Yan Qinrong () that Empress Wei was committing adultery, and that her partisans, including Li Guo'er, her new husband Wu Yanxiu (Ê≠¶Âª∂ÁßÄ, a grandnephew of Wu Zetian), and Zong Chuke, were planning to overthrow the Tang dynasty. Emperor Zhongzong ordered Lang executed, but became displeased when Zong had Yan killed without Emperor Zhongzong having decided to do so. This caused Empress Wei and her partisans to begin to become apprehensive. Empress Wei was, meanwhile, having affairs with the officials Ma Qinke () and Yang Jun (). She wanted to be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian, and Li Guo'er wanted to be crown princess‚Äîa request that Emperor Zhongzong had repeatedly rebuffed. According to traditional historians, they thus decided to have Emperor Zhongzong killed. They accomplished this by putting poison in a cake, and after Emperor Zhongzong ate the cake, he died on 3 July, 710.ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Initially, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor, with Empress Wei retaining power as empress dowager and regent. Less than a month later, Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion and killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er. Subsequently, Li Dan took the throne again, displacing Emperor Shang. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Zhongzong was buried in an imperial burial, and as Empress Wei was considered unsuitable to be buried with him, Emperor Ruizong was set to bury Emperor Zhongzong's first wife Princess Zhao, whom Emperor Zhongzong had posthumously honored an empress, with him, but Princess Zhao's body could no longer be located. Therefore, a ceremony was held in which her spirit was summoned to accompany Emperor Zhongzong in death.

It is the capital of Skikda Province and Skikda District. History Statue from Skikda's museum The Phoenicians and Carthaginians established a trading post and fort named (, \\"Jug Cape\\") after Skikda's nearby cape. Falling under Roman hegemony after the Punic Wars, the name was Latinized as RusicadePlin., Nat. Hist., Book V, ¬ß22; Tab. Peut., 3.3; Rav. Cosmogr., 39.12. or Rusiccade.Mela, De Situ, Book I, ¬ß33; Julius Honorius, Cosmogr., A.44; Vibius Sequester, Geogr., p. 151. Rusicade contained the largest Roman theatre in Algeria, dating to the reign of Hadrian. In late antiquity, the port was destroyed during the Vandals' invasion of 530. The Byzantines reconquered the region in 533 and 534, but left large areas under Berber control. The town was overrun by the Umayyad Caliphate at the end of the 7th century. Present-day Skikda was founded by Sylvain Charles Val√©e in 1838 under the name Philippeville, honoring the French king at the time. The French were in the process of annexing Algeria and developed Philippeville as a port for Constantine, Algeria's third-largest city. The two cities were connected by rail. On 10 October 1883, there was an earthquake in Philippeville. Towards the end of World War II, a UNRRA refugee camp name ' was established near the city. On 25 January 1945, 200 Jews holding citizenship from countries in North and South America were sent from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to Switzerland as part of a prisoner exchange group. They were later sent to the UNRRA camp in Skikda.source Page at Holocaust database Battle of Philippeville An attack by the FLN in 1955 during the war of Independence left around 123 civilians dead, mainly French and those suspected of collaboration.Ben Abro, Assassination!

On 15 February 1989 the Dutch tanker the MV Maassluis was anchored just outside the port, waiting to dock the next day at the terminal, when extreme weather broke out. The ship's anchors did not hold and the ship smashed on the pier-head of the port. The disaster killed 27 of the 29 people on board.Website Nieuwsdossier on Sinking of Maassluis, retrieved 3 August 2010 Modern Skikda The city has a population of 250,000. Natural gas, oil refining, and petrochemical industries were developed in the 1970s and pipelines have been built for their transportation. The city hall (a neo- moorish style palace) and the railroad station were designed by Le Corbusier. The official city flag colours are blue and white, the colours of the Mediterranean. The current postal code is 21000. Skikda has the third largest commercial port in Algeria after Algiers and Oran. It has also a petrochemical terminal port and a smaller fishing port in Stora, and there are many beaches along the natural Mediterranean coastline. There is also a closed airport near the petrochemical complex. Geography Space Shuttle Atlantis, November 2009 Skikda lies on the coast of the Gulf of Stora, part of the Mediterranean Sea. The landscape is hilly and forested, with high ridges on both the western and eastern sides of the city. Climate Skikda has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), with cool, wet winters and very warm, dry summers. Economy Historically, Skikda is known for its seaport. It was described, in 1911, by Baedeker as having \\"the youngest Algerian seaport.\\" On 19 January 2004, a fire and explosion at the Skikda LNG facility killed 29 people and caused $940,000,000 worth of damage. The accident incapacitated three LNG trains and impacted approximately 2% of the world's liquefaction capacity. The explosion was preceded by the ingestion of a sizable leak of cold hydrocarbon into the boiler of the westernmost LNG line. This caused the boiler to explode. According to the 2014 Marsh report into the world's largest industrial disaster, the Skikda explosion is ranked No. 3 in the hydrocarbon industry. Transportation Skikda Railway Station The main road from Skikda is the N3 to El Arrouch, Constantine, Batna, Biskra and Touggourt. Smaller local roads lead to the towns of Stora (to the northwest along the coast), Beni Bechir (to the south), Bissy and Azzabe (to the southeast), and El Mersa and Chetaibi (to the east).

Geology The unconsolidated sand of the Carolina Sandhills is mapped as the Quaternary Pinehurst Formation, and is interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago.Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, \\"The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States\\": Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary- research Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures, stronger winds, and less vegetation.Swezey, C.S.

Doar III, ed.), Geological Society of America Field Guide 42, p. 9-36. These Cretaceous strata are thought to be the source of the sand of the Pinehurst Formation. In South Carolina and North Carolina, these Cretaceous strata are mapped as the Middendorf Formation.Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., and Whittecar, G.R., 2016, Geology and geomorphology of the Carolina Sandhills, Chesterfield County, South Carolina, in: Gold, Structures, and Landforms in Central South Carolina (W.R.

A notable hill of these Cretaceous strata is Sugarloaf Mountain, which is located within the Sand Hills State Forest in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Soils The soils of the Carolina Sandhills are very sandy. According to soil surveys of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, many soils of the Carolina Sandhills are mapped as the Alpin sand or Candor sand.Swezey, C.S., Fitzwater, B.A., Whittecar, G.R., Mahan, S.A., Garrity, C.P., Aleman Gonzalez, W.B., and Dobbs, K.M., 2016, The Carolina Sandhills: Quaternary eolian sand sheets and dunes along the updip margin of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, southeastern United States: Quaternary Research, v. 86, p. 271-286; www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary- research Vegetation The Carolina Sandhills region is characterized by xeric sand community vegetation dominated by pine trees,Christensen, N.L., 2000. \\"Vegetation of the southeastern Coastal Plain\\".

Much of the Carolina Sandhills is known for an ecosystem of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and wiregrass (Aristida stricta). This ecosystem is maintained by frequent low-intensity fires that facilitate the reproduction of the trees, wiregrass, and associated plants. This ecosystem once formed one of the more extensive ecosystems in North America, and longleaf pine was once the dominant tree that covered ~60% of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain. Today, however, only about 1% of this region supports longleaf pine.Earley, 2004. Looking for Longleaf Wildlife More than 30 plant and animal species associated with the longleaf pine ecosystem are listed as threatened or endangered, and many of these species require interactions with the longleaf pine and with frequent low-intensity fires. The most famous endangered species of the Carolina Sandhills is probably the red- cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which prefers to excavate nesting and roosting cavities in living trees of longleaf pine that are 80‚Äì120 years old.Askins, A.H., 2010, Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan: U.S. Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service‚ÄìSoutheast Region, 234p. Another rare species that can be found is the Pine Barrens tree frog, which are tolerant of low pH levels and often lay eggs in shallow, acidic ponds. The species can only be found in the Carolina Sandhills, Southern Alabama/Florida panhandle and the closely related ecosystem New Jersey Pinelands. Dryophytes andersonii is also the state amphibian of North Carolina. Human history Sand Hills cottage architecture is a style that developed in this area in the early- to midlle 1800s; it is a modified form of Greek Revival architecture. The people of the 'Piney Woods' that once covered the Sandhills and Inner Banks were known as \\"Goobers\\" around the time of the Civil War... Preservation The Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern South Carolina attempts to preserve a fraction of the original Sandhills longleaf pine ecosystem. The refuge is located in Chesterfield County near McBee.

Life He was born in Pont-√†-Mousson, Lorraine, France, where his Scottish-born father, William Barclay, held the chair of civil law. His mother was a Frenchwoman. His early education was obtained at the Jesuit College at Pont-a-Mousson. While there, at the age of nineteen, he wrote a commentary on the Thebaid of Statius. The Jesuits endeavored to induce him to join their order; but his father refused to give his consent and took him to England in 1603. Barclay had persistently maintained his Scottish nationality in his French surroundings, and probably found in James VI and I's accession an opportunity which he would not let slip. In early 1604 John Barclay presented James with a Latin poem, \\"Kalendae Januariae\\", and afterward dedicated to him the first part of his Euphormionis Satyricon (Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon) against the Jesuits. He returned to France by 1605, when a second edition of that book appeared in Paris, having spent some time in Angers. He was the husband of a Frenchwoman, Louise Debonaire. Barclay and his wife returned to London in 1606, and there published his Sylvae, a collection of Latin poems. In 1607 the second part of the Satyricon appeared in Paris. In 1616 he went to Rome and resided there until his death on 15 August 1621, aged 39. His departure from England may have been prompted by the threat that his children would be brought up as Protestants, since they had been born in England. To the Catholic Barclay, this was unacceptable. In addition he may have been seeking a more generous patron than the somewhat parsimonious King James. In fact Barclay received a pension of some 150 pounds from the Pope. He wrote his major novel, Argenis, in Rome and, according to his contemporaries, indulged in gardening. He was a member of several learned and literary societies in Rome, including the Accademia dei Lincei.http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006500&searchAssoc;=Assoc accessed9/7/2017 His wife outlived him and died in 1652. One son became bishop of Toul in France and survived until 1673. Works In 1609 Barclay edited the De Potestate Papae, an anti-papal treatise by his father, who had died in the preceding year. In 1611 he issued an Apologia or \\"third part\\" of the Satyricon, in answer to the attacks of the Jesuits. A so-called \\"fourth part,\\" with the title of Icon Animorum, describing the character and manners of the European nations, appeared in 1614. He appears to have been on better terms with the Church and notably with Robert Bellarmine, for in 1617 he issued, from a press at Rome, a Paraenesis ad Sectarios, an attack on the position of Protestantism. Later editions were published in Cologne. The literary effort of his closing years was his best-known work the Argenis, a political romance, resembling in certain respects the Arcadia of Philip Sidney, and the Utopia of Thomas More. The book was completed about a fortnight before his death, which has been said to have been hastened by poison.

Life The houses of old Calton Village on Calton Hill Barclay was born at Muthill in Perthshire the son of Ludovic Barclay a farmer and miller. He studied Theology at St. Andrews University, and was highly influenced by the thoughts of Rev Archibald Campbell.ODNB: John Barclay After being licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland through the presbytery of Auchterarder in September 1759, he became assistant to Rev James Jobson, the parish minister of Errol in Perthshire. Owing to differences with the minister, he left in 1763 and was then appointed assistant to Antony Dow of Fettercairn in Kincardineshire. During his period here he made several publications, and gained the reputation as a trouble-maker, distancing himself from the established church. In 1772, lacking a patron as then required by the church, he was rejected as successor to Dow, and was also refused by the presbytery the testimonials required in order to obtain another living. The refusal of the presbytery was sustained by the General Assembly. Dow was instead succeeded by Rev Robert Foote. Barclay then left the established Scottish church and founded his own church in Edinburgh but also with branches London and Sauchieburn near Stirling. His followers were called Barclayans, Barclayites or Bereans, the latter because they regulated their conduct by study of the Scriptures after the biblical Bereans of Acts xvii. 11. They held to a modified form of Calvinism. The Berean Church had congregations in Scotland, London and Bristol, but mainly merged with the Congregationalists after Barclay's death. His works, which included many hymns and paraphrases of the psalms, and a book called Without Faith, without God, were edited by J. Thomson and D. Macmillan, with a memoir (1852). In 1784 he was living in a house in Calton village on Calton Hill.Williamson's Edinburgh Street Directory 1784 The houses still exist but it is unclear which house he lived in.

Following the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May, French and British forces advanced into Belgium. The German campaign plan (Case Yellow) had evolved into a decoy operation in the Netherlands and Belgium, with the main effort through the Ardennes. German units crossed the Meuse without waiting for reinforcements at the Battle of Sedan. Instead of consolidating bridgeheads on the west bank of the Meuse, the Germans began an advance down the Somme river valley towards the English Channel. The Allies were thrown into confusion and their attempts to cut off the panzer spearheads degenerated into sporadic, un-coordinated counter-attacks which never achieved sufficient concentration to succeed as the main Allied armies were in Belgium. The offensive at Arras was planned by the British and French to relieve the pressure on the British garrison in the town of Arras and was not coordinated with an attack by the French from the south of the German panzer corridor. Constrained by the limited forces available to them, the Anglo-French offensive was carried out by a small mixed force of British and French tanks and infantry who advanced south from Arras. The Allies made some early gains and panicked a number of German units but after an advance of up to , they were forced to withdraw after dark to avoid encirclement. The attack was a failure but had a disproportionate effect on Hitler and (OKW, German armed forces high command). Concern about more Anglo-French counter-attacks against the panzer corridor before non-motorised German infantry divisions caught up, led Hitler to order the panzer advance to stop until the situation at Arras had been restored. The Allies used the pause to reinforce the Channel Ports, prevent their rapid capture and fortify the western approaches to Dunkirk before the Germans arrived, making the evacuation of the British and French forces in Operation Dynamo possible. Background=Battle of France Army Group A ( Gerd von Rundstedt) defeated the French at the Battle of Sedan from 12 to 15 May and crossed the Meuse. A French counter-attack at the Battle of Montcornet on 17 May by the (4e DCr, Colonel Charles de Gaulle), from Montcornet to the south, was defeated by an improvised defence and the 10th Panzer Division, which was rushed forward on the French flank. The German counter-attacks were supported by VIII ( Wolfram von Richthofen) and the French lost and armoured vehicles. On 19 May, after receiving reinforcements, the 4e DCr attacked again and was repulsed with the loss of of its vehicles, much of the loss being caused by the aircraft of VIII, which attacked French units as they massed to attack the flanks of German units. By the end of the Battle of Montcornet, much of the French Ninth Army on the Meuse had disintegrated under the attacks of VIII. German spearheads broke through the Peronne‚ÄìCambrai gap and threatened Boulogne and Calais, cutting the lines of communication of the Allied armies of 1 (General Gaston Billotte) in the North-East Theatre of Operations ( Alphonse Joseph Georges), separating them from the main French armies south of the Somme. On 19 May, General Edmund Ironside, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, conferred with Lord Gort, commander of the BEF, at his headquarters near Lens and urged Gort to save the BEF, by attacking towards Amiens to the south-west but Gort had only two divisions available for an attack. Ironside met Billotte, finding him apparently incapable of taking action. Ironside returned to Britain and ordered urgent anti-invasion measures. On the morning of 20 May, General Maurice Gamelin, the Commander-in-chief of the French armed forces, ordered the armies trapped in Belgium and northern France to fight their way south, to link up with French forces attacking northwards from the Somme river. On the evening of 19 May, the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud had sacked Gamelin and replaced him with General Maxime Weygand. Weygand cancelled the orders and after a delay, ordered a similar counter-offensive from the north and south against the German \\"corridor\\", to break the encircled armies out of the pocket. In the north the British combined their available divisions with the 50th infantry division which was holding the Vimy area to create a contingent which was code-named Frankforce. Frankforce was to hold the line of the river Scarpe to the east of Arras with the 5th Infantry Division, while the rest of the force attacked to the south of Arras and the new French 3 ( Antoine-Marie- Beno√Æt Besson) attacked north from the Somme. King Leopold III of Belgium told Gort that he did not expect the BEF to risk itself to keep contact with the Belgian army but warned the British that if they persisted with the southern offensive, the Belgians would be overstretched and collapse. Leopold suggested that the Allies should establish a beachhead covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports instead. The BEF reinforced Arras despite Gort having doubts about the French plan. (Billotte took part in a meeting in Ypres from 19 to 21 May. Driving back after this meeting, he had a road accident, fell into a coma and died soon afterwards, leaving the Allied 1 (1st Army Group) leaderless for three days; around that time, the British decided to evacuate from the Channel ports. Prelude=German advance The 7th Panzer Division had captured Cambrai and advanced to the area south of Arras. For 21 May, the division was ordered to wheel west around Arras and attack to the north, capturing crossings over the Scarpe at Acq, a risky manoeuvre since the right flank would be vulnerable to a counter-attack from Arras. The 5th Panzer Division (Lieutenant-General Max von Hartlieb-Walsporn) was to attack so as to relieve pressure on the 7th Panzer Division (the division was delayed and never managed to fulfil its orders). Rommel ordered to probe towards Acq forward with two motorised infantry regiments to follow later, which left most of the division without tanks. Rommel led the advance but returned around when the infantry failed to arrive and at the positions of (Fusilier or Rifle Regiment), found himself under attack by tanks and infantry. Allied offensive preparations Georges ordered General d'Astier de la Vigerie, commander of of the to support the British attack but sent no details of the attack front, no targets and no zero hour for the attack. D'Astier was also unable to contact the First Army headquarters or the HQ of the Air Component RAF of the BEF, which was out of action, as it was moving back to bases in England. French reconnaissance aircraft were shot down or chased away until when aircraft got through to Arras and found no activity around Cambrai. Major-General Harold Franklyn, commander of the British 5th Infantry Division was put in charge of Frankforce, improvised from his division, the 50th (Northumbrian) Motor Division (Major-General Giffard Martel) and the of the 1st Army Tank Brigade. Frankforce had moved to the vicinity of Vimy, north of Arras to reinforce the Allied garrison at Arras, for a counter-attack to the south, to cut German communications in the vicinity. Franklyn had detached a brigade each from the 5th Infantry Division and the 50th Motor Division, which had only two instead of the usual three brigades each. Franklyn was not aware of a French push northwards toward Cambrai and the French were ignorant of a British attack south toward Arras. Franklyn had support from the French (Lieutenant-General Ren√© Prioux) of the French First Army, which had fought at the Battle of Hannut with its SOMUA S35 cavalry tanks. Many of the tanks of the (1√®re DLM) had been destroyed in the earlier battles and the rest had been distributed among infantry divisions and could not be reassembled in time, despite threats to court-martial officers who refused to release the tanks. By 21 May, Prioux could only contribute a few tanks of the (3e DLM). The attack had been intended to be made by two French and two British infantry divisions but Frankforce comprised only about after the detachment of brigades to the defence of Arras, the river to the east and into reserve. The defensive deployments left only the 6th and 8th battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI), of 151st Brigade and one in reserve as well as the 13th Infantry Brigade, supporting the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4th RTR) and the 7th Royal Tank Regiment (7th RTR), a force of about and The tanks were , thickly armoured but equipped only with a machine gun and tanks, very well armoured and carrying a 2-pounder gun and a machine-gun. Allied plan The original instructions given to Franklyn had been to plan a limited attack south of Arras, to relieve the garrison. Changes made by Ironside for a more ambitious combined attack with the French, were not communicated to Franklyn, who used most of Frankforce defensively, to reinforce Arras and relieve the French Cavalry Corps to the east of the town. Martel was ordered to plan an attack to an area of over . A force based on the 151st Infantry Brigade (Brigadier J. A. Churchill), was to advance from the west of Arras and move round to the Cojeul river; the 13th Infantry Brigade (Brigadier M. C. Dempsey) of the 5th Infantry Division was then to cross the river and advance southwards from the east side of Arras, to meet the 151st Infantry Brigade. A Right Column of the 7th RTR, 8th DLI, 365th Battery, 92nd Field Regiment RA, 260th Battery, 65th (Norfolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment RA, a platoon of the 151st Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a motor-cycle scout platoon of the 4th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers and a Left Column of the 4th RTR, 6th DLI, 368th Battery, 92nd Field Regiment RA, 206th Battery, 52nd Anti-Tank Regiment RA, a platoon of the 151st Brigade Anti-Tank Company, one company and a scout platoon of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers, were to cross the Arras‚ÄìDoullens road at which meant that the infantry would have to make an approach march to reach the jumping- off point, over roads filled with traffic and refugees. Battle=3e DLM An advance by the 3e DLM, to screen the right flank of the British force was also poorly prepared with insufficient liaison, the French not being told of the timing and direction of the British attack. In the confusion an exchange of fire occurred between the French SOMUA S35s and British anti-tank guns near Warlus. An anti-tank gun was knocked out, British soldiers were killed and several French tanks hit before the mistake was discovered. During the evening, the French force, with about six SOMUAs, engaged south of Duisans. British troops were retreating and by the time the German tanks broke through, the British had escaped. Right Column The time taken by the infantry to reach the assembly points for the attack, through the refugee traffic on the roads, left little time to study their orders or reconnoitre. Mar≈ìuil was being bombarded when 50th (Northumbrian) Motor Division began the advance. The Right Column advanced at and received small-arms fire from a wood. The column had to fight through Duisans, which was occupied by German infantry and French tanks on the right, reported tanks of of the 7th Panzer Division to the west. Two companies of the 8th DLI and two troops of the 260th Anti-Tank Battery were left to garrison the village and then the depleted column captured Warlus against stronger opposition and had to leave another garrison behind. Berneville to the south was also captured and a party of the 7th RTR and 8th DLI pressed on to the Arras‚ÄìDoullens road, where they met part of and troops of the SS-Totenkopf Division. The British were forced under cover by machine-gun and mortar fire and the attacked the Right Column for twenty minutes. Junkers Ju 87 belonging to I, and III , Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 dive-bombed British forces at Arras. I Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 is known to have bombed infantry positions north of Arras. The tanks kept going and then reached Wailly, where they met troops of the Division. The advanced guard suffered many casualties, retreated to Warlus and German tanks counter- attacked Warlus and Duisans. The German attacks were repulsed but managed to cut the road between the villages and the Right Column was unable to advance further. Left Column The Left Column also met resistance as soon as it advanced and fought its way through at Dainville. Another further on at Achicourt, six Matildas overran a line of anti-tank guns and then the column kept going to Agny and Beaurains, before a party reached Wancourt on the Cojeul. Infantry garrisoned Agny and Beaurains and the 4th RTR repulsed German counter-attacks by tanks and , on the right flank of the 7th Panzer Division; the British then took ground south of Beaurains. Fighting went on all afternoon between Mercatel and Tilloy, where the tanks ran into a line of anti-aircraft guns and artillery, including 88 mm Flak guns and many of the tanks were knocked out. Individual tanks kept going but there were no reserves to consolidate and exploit the success and the advance was stopped in mutually-costly fighting. To the east of Arras, the 150th Infantry Brigade attacked across the Scarpe towards Tilloy and the 13th Infantry Brigade captured a bridgehead further east, ready for the second phase of the attack by Frankforce. 7th Panzer Division was attacked while advancing towards Agny by a British column advancing from Dainville, which knocked out several vehicles; more British tanks attacked from the north and caught the regimental convoys strung out along the road on their right flank. (42nd Anti-Tank Battalion) was rushed up to the area between Agny and Beaurains, but was overrun by the British tanks. After breaking through , they attacked the transport of between Mercatel and Ficheux and then pressed on, throwing the motorised Division into confusion and almost overrunning its headquarters. When the British tanks broke through the German anti-tank screen, the infantry stood their ground, encouraged by Rommel, even after the British tanks had rolled over their anti-tank guns. At around (German time) II Battalion, was attacked by about 40 British tanks, which were engaged by artillery on Hill 111, roughly north-west of Wailly. German guns knocked out several Matilda I tanks. Some larger Matilda II tanks among the Matilda Is advanced through the artillery and anti-tank fire unscathed, German shells bouncing off their armour. The tanks destroyed the German anti-tank guns with return fire and rolled over them, killing the crews. The British tanks were eventually stopped short of Hill 111 by fire from another artillery battery but other tanks bypassed the area on both sides. On the southern flank of the 7th Panzer Division, the Division was attacked and some SS troops fled in panic. Allied retirement The maximum depth of the British advance was ; had been taken, many tanks and much equipment had been destroyed but two Matilda IIs had been knocked out. Only were still operational and both tank battalion commanders had been killed; during the evening, Franklyn ordered both columns to withdraw. French cavalry remained near Warlus, was surrounded during the night and only a few tanks managed to break out. The infantry of the Right Column in Warlus were rescued, because six French tanks arrived with two armoured infantry vehicles and broke out through the German position on the Warlus‚ÄìDuisans road. The garrison in Duisans also retired after dark, in the Bren carriers of the 9th DLI, covered by the anti-tank guns of the brigade reserve in Mar≈ìuil. The Left Column troops in Agny and Beaurains were bombed and then attacked by tanks as they retreated, one party missing the road (and eventually reaching Boulogne). The 7th Panzer Division laagered overnight south of Dainville, with advanced parties of infantry close to the south bank of the Scarpe. Aftermath=Analysis In 1953, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian wrote that the attack at Arras succeeded in easing German pressure round Arras and delaying the encirclement of the BEF. The ground between Arras and the Cojeul was re-occupied and there was no serious German attack on the town, Rommel making the alarmist claim that the attack was made by five divisions. Beyond the delay imposed on German moves and the many casualties inflicted on the Germans, the attack was bound to fail without a force sufficiently powerful to follow up and consolidate the captured ground. Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A, had intended that the panzer divisions should rest after the exertions on 20 May. In 1978, Cooper wrote that the attack at Arras led to the German higher commanders to continue to attack northwards, to capture the channel ports. Attacking to the south-west was rejected and OKH ordered to capture Boulogne and Calais, about away. Apprehension of another Allied attack caused Rundstedt to order to remain in position, the XLI Corps (Reinhardt) sent a division eastwards as a precaution and Kleist diverted the 10th Panzer Division and parts of the 1st Panzer Division and the 2nd Panzer Division from the XIX Corps (Guderian) to hold the bridgehead over the Somme, which slowed the advance to Dunkirk from the beginning. The XIX Corps attacked again at on 22 May but was still hampered by a \\"near paralysis\\" in the German command, Rundstedt ordering that the instructions from OKH were to be ignored and the advance on Boulogne and Calais would have to wait. At Rundstedt countermanded his own order but for five hours, the panzers had waited on the Amache river. In 2005, Frieser wrote that Allied planning was notable for its failure to cut the panzer corridor when there were insufficient German motorised divisions to consolidate behind the panzer divisions and the non-motorised divisions were several days' march away. The corridor was only wide at Arras and vulnerable to a pincer movement; The Allies could have achieved a Clausewitzian counter-encirclement and cut off the panzers on the channel coast. Halder had been willing to run the risk, because of the incapacity of the Allies to achieve a fast tempo of operations. The Allied attack was contained because Rommel improvised a gun line of anti- tank guns and anti-aircraft guns, that managed to stop some of the lighter British tanks; the infantry tanks, particularly the Matilda IIs, proved very difficult to knock out with the standard 37 mm anti tank gun. Rommel also used wireless to order another gun line quickly to be set up with artillery and several anti-aircraft guns much further back, which knocked out 24 tanks in a few minutes on the flat ground between Mercatel and Tilloy. Just after Junkers Ju 87 of I and VIII arrived and made on the retiring tanks by Rommel ordered Panzer-Regiment 25 to return and cut off the British tanks but south of Duisans it met French tanks covering the British right flank and only pushed through after a long and costly engagement. When the German tanks had broken through a British anti-tank gun line, between Duisans and Warlus, the British tanks had already returned; the British attack had turned into a disaster and only 28 of the 88 tanks committed returned to their start line. The 6th Panzer Division signalled that \\"a strong enemy force was making a breakthrough\\" which caused alarm . Kleist ordered the 6th Panzer Division and 8th Panzer Division eastwards to counter the Allied breakthrough. In the aftermath the Germans treated the Battle of Arras as a minor defeat for the Allies. Casualties Rommel noted in his diary that his division had lost killed, and missing and captured, as many as the first four days of operations, which included the Meuse crossing, although 90 of the missing returned to their units. In 1953, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian, quoted the 7th Panzer Division war diary, which recorded the loss of nine medium and several light tanks, killed or wounded and British records noted some taken prisoner. The British lost around killed or wounded in the attack, it is unknown how many French soldiers became casualties in the engagement. Frankforce lost sixty of the in the attack. Subsequent operations The main French attack on Cambrai took place on 22 May and like the attack on 21 May, the force involved was much smaller than intended. The Tenth Army commander, General Robert Altmayer, should have attacked with the V Corps and tanks of the Prioux Cavalry Corps but only an infantry regiment and two depleted tank battalions could be assembled in time. The panzer divisions had moved on, only small detachments having been left in Cambrai and the marching infantry divisions were not due until later in the day. The French attack reached the fringe of Cambrai only to be stopped by the and forced to retreat. Halt orders Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras, had a disproportionate effect on the Germans because the higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. Ewald von Kleist, the commander of perceived a \\"serious threat\\" and informed Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel- General G√ºnther von Kluge, the 4th Army commander ordered the tanks to halt, with the support of Rundstedt. On 22 May, when the attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before moved on Boulogne and Calais. At OKW the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order that all mobile units were to operate either side of Arras and infantry units were to operate to the east. The crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian; that the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast too quickly and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer division to seize Dunkirk. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Frieser wrote that had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for , Boulogne and Calais would have fallen. Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already been captured by the 10th Panzer Division. Commemoration The battle honour Defence of Arras was awarded to the British units involved in the counter- attack.

It is well known for its well-preserved medieval old town, a destination for tourists from around the world. It is part of the popular Romantic Road through southern Germany. Rothenburg was a Free imperial city from the late Middle Ages to 1803. In 1884 Johann Friedrich (von) Hessing (1838‚Äì1918) built Wildbad Rothenburg o.d.T. 1884‚Äì1903. Name Town Hall of Rothenburg Medieval town wall and Klingentorturm, a defensive tower Southern view of Rothenburg from the castle garden The name \\"Rothenburg ob der Tauber\\" is German for \\"Red castle above the Tauber\\". This is so because the town is located on a plateau overlooking the Tauber River. As to the name \\"Rothenburg\\", some say it comes from the German words rot (red) and burg (burgh, medieval fortified settlement), referring to the red color of the roofs of the houses which overlook the river. The name may also refer to the process of retting (\\"rotten\\" in German) flax for linen production. History=Middle Ages The city was most likely inhabited by Celts before the 1st-century C.E. In 950, the weir system in today's castle garden was constructed by the Count of Comburg-Rothenburg. In 1070, the counts of Comburg-Rothenburg, who also owned the village of Gebsattel, built Rothenburg castle on the mountain top high above the River Tauber. The counts of the Comburg-Rothenburg dynasty died out in 1116. The last count, Count Heinrich, Emperor Heinrich V appointed instead his nephew Konrad von Hohenstaufen as the successor to the Comburg-Rothenburg properties. In 1142, Konrad von Hohenstaufen, who became Konrad III (1138‚Äì52), the self-styled King of the Romans, traded a part of the monastery of Neum√ºnster in W√ºrzburg above the village Detwang and built the Stauffer-Castle Rothenburg on this cheaper land. He held court there and appointed officials called 'reeves' to act as caretakers. In 1170, the city of Rothenburg was founded at the time of the building of Staufer Castle. The center was the marketplace and St. James' Church (in German: the St. Jakob). The development of the oldest fortification can be seen, the old cellar/old moat and the milk market. Walls and towers were built in the 13th century. Preserved are the ‚ÄúWhite Tower‚Äù and the Markus Tower with the R√∂der Arch. From 1194 to 1254, the representatives of the Staufer dynasty governed the area around Rothenburg. Around this time, the Order of St. John and other orders were founded near St. James' Church and a Dominican nunnery (1258). From 1241 to 1242, the Staufer Imperial tax statistics recorded the names of the Jews in Rothenburg. Rabbi Meir Ben Baruch of Rothenburg (died 1293, buried 1307 in Worms) had a great reputation as a jurist in Europe. In 1274, Rothenburg was accorded privileges by King Rudolf of Habsburg as a Free Imperial City. Three famous fairs were established in the city and in the following centuries, the city expanded. The citizens of the city and the Knights of the Hinterland build the Franziskaner (Franciscan) Monastery and the Holy Ghost Hospital (1376/78 incorporated into the city walls). The German Order began the building of St. James' Church, which the citizens have used since 1336. The Heilig Blut (Holy Blood) pilgrimage attracted many pilgrims to Rothenburg, at the time one of the 20 largest cities of the Holy Roman Empire. The population was around 5,500 people within the city walls and another 14,000 in the of the surrounding territory. The Staufer Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356, the St. Blaise chapel is the last remnant today. The Thirty Years' War The Meistertrunk scene in the astronomical clock of the Ratstrinkstube In October 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, the Catholic Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, wanted to quarter his 40,000 troops in Protestant Lutheran Rothenburg. Rather than allow entrance, the town defended itself and intended to withstand a siege. However, Tilly's troops quickly defeated Rothenburg, losing only 300 soldiers. A popular legend called the Meistertrunk states that when General Tilly condemned the councilmen to death and was set to burn the city down, the councilmen tried to sway him with a large drink of 3 1/4 liters wine. Tilly proclaimed that if anyone could drink it all in one drink, he would spare the city. The mayor at the time, Georg Nusch, succeeded, and General Tilly kept his word. However, the story is almost certainly apocryphal. It does not appear in the chronicle of Sebastian Dehner, written about fifteen years after the facts, the earliest account. The Meistertrunk appears for the first time in the chronicle of Georg Heinrich Schaffert, more than a century later. After the winter, they left the town poor and nearly empty, and in 1634 a bubonic plague outbreak killed many more townsfolk. Without any money or power, Rothenburg stopped growing, thus preserving its 17th-century state. 19th century Since 1803, the town has been a part of Bavaria. The famous German landscape painter Eugen Bracht visited Rothenburg in 1877; although he stayed only two days, he was clearly impressed.Joshua Hagen: Preservation, Tourism and Nationalism: The Jewel of the German Past, p. 80 Some years later, especially artists of Romanticism, such as Hans Thoma and Carl Spitzweg, visited Rothenburg, too, followed by the first tourists. Laws were created to prevent major changes to the town. In 1884 Johann Friedrich (von) Hessing built up till 1903 the \\"Hessingsche Wildbad\\". Nazi Germany & World War II Rothenburg held a special significance for Nazi ideologists. For them, it was the epitome of the German 'Home Town', representing all that was quintessentially German. Throughout the 1930s, the Nazi organization KDF (Kraft durch Freude) \\"Strength through Joy\\" organized regular day trips to Rothenburg from all across the Reich. This initiative was staunchly supported by Rothenburg's citizenry ‚Äì many of whom were sympathetic to National Socialism ‚Äì both for its perceived economic benefits and because Rothenburg was hailed as \\"the most German of German towns\\". In October 1938, Rothenburg expelled its Jewish citizens, much to the approval of Nazis and their supporters across Germany.Joshua Hagen, \\"The Most German of Towns: Creating an Ideal Nazi Community in Rothenburg ob der Tauber\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers 94:1 (2004), pp. 207‚Äì227, passim. The creation of an ideal Nazi community reminded the peoples of Germany of the way the Nazis wanted them to live as a family and as a community; Rothenburg simply exemplified this Nazi ideology as idealized family life. Additionally, other German towns followed the 'example' set by Rothenburg for the Nazis, this began a trend of Nazi German Nationalism which led to the creation of an \\"ideal\\" Nazi community in Rothenburg. This then grew to reveal the ideal Nazi family, as illustrated in the propaganda of the time. This ideal lifestyle was taken further when an approved upbringing for the sons of Nazi Germany was introduced, first growing up in a Nazi or Hitler Youth organization, then protecting the ideals of both Nazi Germany and the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler as a civilian or as military personnel, thus forming the core idea of Nazi patriotism, protecting their own beliefs. In many ways, Rothenburg demonstrated key elements of Nazi ideology and epitomized their desire to expand National Socialist thinking throughout Germany and in all areas with German-speaking people across Europe. Rothenburg following Allied bombing raid, 1945 In March 1945, during World War II, German soldiers were stationed in Rothenburg to defend it. On March 31, bombs were dropped over Rothenburg by 16 planes, killing 37 people and destroying 306 houses, six public buildings, nine watchtowers, and over of the wall. The U.S. Assistant Secretary of War, John J. McCloy, knew about the historic importance and beauty of Rothenburg, so he ordered US Army General Jacob L. Devers not to use artillery in taking Rothenburg. Battalion commander Frank Burke, a future Medal of Honor winner, ordered six soldiers of the 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division to march into Rothenburg on a three-hour mission and negotiate the surrender of the town. First Lieutenant Noble V. Borders of Louisville, Kentucky, First Lieutenant Edmund E. Austingen of Hammond, Indiana, Private William M. Dwyer of Trenton, New Jersey, Private Herman Lichey of Glendale, California, Private Robert S. Grimm of Tower City, Pennsylvania, and Private Peter Kick of Lansing, Illinois were sent on the mission. When stopped by a German soldier, Private Lichey, who spoke fluent German and served as the group's translator, held up a white flag and explained, ‚ÄúWe are representatives of our division commander. We bring you his offer to spare the city of Rothenburg from shelling and bombing if you agree not to defend it. We have been given three hours to get this message to you. If we haven‚Äôt returned to our lines by 1800 hours, the town will be bombed and shelled to the ground.‚ÄùWilliam M. Dwyer, ‚ÄúSo Long for Now: A World War II Memoir,\\" Xlibris Corporation (2009), pp 118-131 The local military commander Major Th√∂mmes gave up the town, ignoring the order of Hitler for all towns to fight to the end and thereby saving it from total destruction by artillery. American troops of the 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division occupied the town on April 17, 1945, and in November 1948, McCloy was named an honorary citizen () of Rothenburg. Post-war reconstruction Around 40% of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, mainly in the eastern half of the town, had to be repaired or rebuilt after being bombed in World War II (Closer to 30% of the old town's area would have been completely destroyed and subsequently rebuilt from the ground up). Many of the rebuilt facades can now be distinguished from the surviving medieval structures as being more plain, since the reconstruction aimed not to replicate exactly what stood before, but only to rebuild in the same style as the surviving buildings, so that the new buildings would still fit into the overall aesthetic of the town. Any surviving walls of bombed-out buildings were kept in their reconstructed facades as much as possible. In the case of more significant or iconic structures, such as the town hall (whose roof was destroyed) and parts of the town wall, restoration to their original state was done as accurately as possible, and these now appear exactly as they had before the war. Donations for the rebuilding works in Rothenburg were received from all over the world, and rebuilt parts of the walls feature commemorative bricks with donor names. While much of the eastern portion of Rothenburg was destroyed or damaged in World War II and has been subsequently restored, the older western section from which the medieval town originated (and which contains most of the town's historic monuments) did not suffer from the bombing. Thus, most of the buildings in the west and south of Rothenburg still exist today in their original medieval or pre-war state. It is also noteworthy that while the eastern walls and towers did receive bomb damage, they (unlike the houses in that part of town) remained relatively intact (many even survived completely) due to their sturdy stone construction. In most cases, only the less-stable upper portions and roofs of these eastern towers and walls needed to be rebuilt, while the majority of their stone bases and walls are preserved in their original state to this day.

The rear Gothic part of the building dates from 1250, and the attached front Renaissance building was started in 1572. This building served as the seat of government for the city-state during the medieval ages and for the city of Rothenburg since the formation of the federalist government. The town hall tower of Rothenburg ob der Tauber is one of the only accessible towers in the town of Rothenburg. The other is the Roedertor tower at the east end of the city and is open daily for visitors to climb. It is almost tall. At the top of the tower, an admission fee of 2 euros is charged to enter the room with a scenic view of almost the entire town. The room also contains manuscripts providing the visitor with historical information about the construction and relevant history of the city wall. The largely rebuilt eastern section of Rothenburg seen from the top of the Roeder tower Garden in Rothenburg (2005) While buildings within the walled city reflect the city's medieval history, this part of the city is in many ways a normal, modern German town with some concession to the tourist trade. Many stores and hotels catering to tourists are clustered around the Town Hall Square and along several major streets (such as Herrngasse, Schmiedgasse). Also in the town is a Criminal Museum, containing various punishment and torture devices used during the Middle Ages. A staple pastry of Rothenburg ob der Tauber is the Schneeball, deep-fried dough shaped like a snowball and covered in either confectioner's sugar or chocolate. From 1988 until March 2006, Herbert Hachtel (SPD) was the mayor of Rothenburg. He was succeeded by Walter Hartl.

It is sometimes mistaken as the town at the end of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971); that town was N√∂rdlingen. The town served as a loose basis for the fictional town of Lebensbaum (\\"life tree\\") in the video game Shadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in the American market).Shadow of Memories, review on Adventure Archive. Pictures of the town were used in some parts of The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm and the trailer for the film.

Robert Shackleton's Unvisited Places of Old Europe contains a chapter, \\"The Old Red City of Rothenburg\\", about the city and its history. Rothenburg is the primary location for Elizabeth Peters's mystery novel, Borrower of the Night (1973) about the search for a missing Tilman Riemenschneider sculpture. The town featured as the location in the Belgian comic book La Fronti√®re de la vie (The Frontier of Life, 1977) and it inspired the look of the town in the Japanese manga and anime series A Little Snow Fairy Sugar (2001).Shackleton, Robert, Unvisited Places of Old Europe, Philadelphia: Penn Publishing Co., 1922, pp. 189-203. Rothenburg's famous street Kobolzeller Steige and Spitalgasse is depicted on the cover of two Blackmore's Night albums, 1999's Under a Violet Moon and their 2006 album Winter Carols. It is often thought to have inspired the town center of M√™l√©e Island in the 1990 point-and-click graphic adventure game The Secret of Monkey Island, but creator Ron Gilbert has claimed the resemblance is a coincidence. The video game Team Fortress 2 features a map titled \\"Rottenburg\\", a play on the original's namesake along with visually similar architecture. The southern part of the marketplace is prominently featured in the video game Gabriel Knight 2 depicting the fictional town of Rittersberg.

The hymn was first printed in Hymns for Saints' Days, and Other Hymns, by Earl Nelson, 1864. Tune The hymn was sung to the melody Sarum, by the Victorian composer Joseph Barnby, until the publication of the English Hymnal in 1906. This hymnal used a new setting by Ralph Vaughan Williams which he called Sine Nomine (literally, \\"without name\\") in reference to its use on the Feast of All Saints, 1 November (or the first Sunday in November, All Saints Sunday in the Lutheran Church). It has been described as \\"one of the finest hymn tunes of [the 20th] century.\\"Clothier Although most English hymn tunes of its era are written for singing in SATB four-part harmony, Sine Nomine is primarily unison (verses 1,2,3,7 and 8) with organ accompaniment; three verses (4, 5 and 6) are set in sung harmony. The tune appears in this forms in most English hymnbooks (for example English Hymnal (641), New English Hymnal (197), Common Praise (232)) and American hymnals (for example, The Hymnal 1982 and the Lutheran Service Book (677)). Since the 1990s, some Presbyterian churches and groups affiliated with Reformed University Fellowship in the United States use a tune composed by Christopher Miner. Charles Villiers Stanford's tune Engelberg was also written to be partnered with this hymn, although in the wake of Sine nomine it never gained popularity and is now more commonly used with other hymns, including \\"When in Our Music God is Glorified.\\" Text \\"For All Thy Saints\\" (Sarum Hymnal, 1868) :1. For all the saints, who from their labours rest, :Who Thee by faith before the world confessed, :Thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blessed. :Alleluia, Alleluia! :2.

Legal troubles=2001 and 2002 charges According to DuPage County (Illinois) court records, in June 2001, Pierce was arrested and had to post bail on charges of criminal defacement and mob action for allegedly spray-painting his high school, although Pierce disputes the records. In September 2002, Pierce was charged with one count of third-degree sexual assault in Iowa City. He was arrested on October 1. On September 7, a report was filed by a woman who was treated at a hospital emergency room the day before. She accused Pierce, an acquaintance, of performing unwanted sex acts on her at a party at his Iowa City apartment on September 6. According to records, Pierce held the woman's hands over her head and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. He was subsequently suspended indefinitely from the Iowa Hawkeyes by athletic department officials, which was atypical, as the school usually waits for the legal process to play out before making a decision, but the school took swift action because of the severity of the charge. To avoid imprisonment, Pierce pleaded guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge of assault causing injury in a sexual assault. He received no jail time, but received a deferred judgment, so the charge was erased from his record after he successfully completed a year of probation, counseling and 200 hours of community service, the requirements of the plea agreement. He later apologized publicly for engaging in \\"inappropriate sexual conduct with a fellow student.\\" Pierce sat out the 2002‚Äì03 season after his plea bargain but took it as a redshirt year to avoid losing it as a year of eligibility. Because there were many people upset over Pierce being allowed to remain on the team and keep his scholarship, two petitions totaling over 3,000 signatures were filed protesting the circumstances of the school's handling of the case. A petition started by a law school student had 1,873 signatures, while the university's Women's Resource and Action Center collected 1,230. Amid resolutions urging students to boycott the men's basketball games, the petition had urged season ticket holders to ask the athletic department for a refund or to transfer their tickets to another athletic team, actions Pierce's attorney Alfredo Parrish labeled \\"absolutely ridiculous\\" because \\"[they] don't know the facts\\" before \\"[reaching] a conclusion.\\" Pierce spent that season working on improving his game while he was not competing.Iowa Pierce-ing things together - Men's College Basketball - ESPN - \\"Pierce spent his redshirt season working on his shooting, getting stronger, driving with the ball and making crisper passes.\\" Pierce was back in uniform with the team in August 2003, in a return for the 2003‚Äì04 season, in which he led the Hawkeyes on a five-game tour of Australia. In those games, he averaged 20.8 points a game on better than 50-percent shooting, and almost 5 rebounds per game. 2005 charges and imprisonment On January 27, 2005, a disturbance was investigated at the West Des Moines home of a woman Pierce had been dating for 2¬Ω years. He allegedly choked her, threatened her with a knife and stripped her after an argument over her new boyfriend. Pierce was also accused of causing damage to her apartment and stealing a laptop and camera. After police confirmed Pierce was the focus of their investigation, he was dismissed from the basketball team by coach Steve Alford on February 2, with Alford saying that [Pierce had] betrayed the trust they placed in him when he was given a second chance two years prior. At the time, Pierce was the leading scorer on the team averaging 17.8 points per game, the third-best in the Big Ten Conference, and led the Hawkeyes with 16.1 points a game as a sophomore in 2003‚Äì04. Pierce met with Alford for about 15 minutes on February 15, and Pierce's appeal to have his dismissal reconsidered was rejected by Alford. Pierce remained on scholarship and was still attending classes. Pierce's attorney Alfredo Parrish sought dismissal of the most serious of the charges, first-degree burglary, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of up to 25 years upon conviction. On February 28, 2005, Pierce pleaded not guilty to two charges of first-degree burglary, assault with intent to commit sexual assault and fourth-degree criminal mischief. Because the first-degree burglary charges and the assault charges are felonies, a conviction would mean Pierce could have been sentenced to up to 56 years and fined $9,000. In March, he waived his right to a speedy trial, delaying it from mid-May to a later date. Months later, fresh evidence surfaced that Pierce made more than 200 phone calls to his ex-girlfriend in March and April, which violated a no-contact order. In May 2005, a judge allowed Pierce to travel outside of Iowa to attend a Chicago, Illinois-based camp in preparation for June's 2005 NBA Draft. Strict conditions were placed on Pierce, including the posting of a $30,000 cash bond, that he stay with his parents in the Chicago area and that he submit a plan outlining his supervision while attending the camp. In August 2005, he reached a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to third-degree burglary, assault with an intent to commit sexual abuse, false imprisonment, and fourth-degree criminal mischief in Dallas County District Court. He was originally charged with two counts of first-degree burglary, but prosecutors agreed to dismiss these, which would have carried a 25-year sentence. He was sentenced on October 28, 2005 to a five-year suspended sentence on the burglary charge, two years on the assault charge and one year each for false imprisonment and criminal mischief, the sentences to be served concurrently. Pierce served 332 days (11 months) of a 2-year sentence at Iowa's Mount Pleasant Correctional Facility before being released on probation on September 24, 2006. Pierce originally sought early release but learned he was denied on August 7, 2006, thus delaying his freedom for several weeks. He received time off for good behavior and participation in prison treatment programs including a 4- to 5-month treatment program for sex offenders. He was to remain on probation for the next four years and one month, and had to register with the Iowa Sex Offender Registry before his release. Release Pierce was named to the roster of Golden State Warriors' 2007 NBA Summer League competition in Las Vegas, in which he played impressively,WARRIORS: 2007 summer league home - \\"Kelenna Azubuike, Pierre Pierce and Toby Bailey each impressed onlookers during their stints on the floor.\\"Player with a Past: Pierre Pierce - \\"In his first two games for Golden State's summer league team, he is averaging an efficient 21 points per game on a mix of creative drives and a pretty longball jumpers.\\" .. \\"he has showed plenty of promise.\\" averaging 21.5 points in his first two games. Because the terms of his probation prevented him from leaving Iowa to pursue a career with the NBA, his participation in the Nevada-based summer league was a violation, which resulted in him being sentenced in April 2008 to 30 days' jail. In September 2008, the Iowa Supreme Court allowed Pierce to leave Iowa to play professionally in France where he signed a $120,000 contract with a team (Hy√®res-Toulon Var BasketPIERRE PIERCE basketball profile, eurobasket.com) in their top professional league in which he averaged 13.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists in 30 French League games.

Its name can also refer to the Seletar Planning Area (as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority), situated in the North-East Region of Singapore. The place name was derived from the Malay subgroup who were indigenous to the area, the Orang Seletar. It shares boundaries with the planning areas of Sengkang to the south, Punggol to the east, Yishun and Simpang to the west, as well as the Straits of Johor to the north. Formerly Royal Air Force Station Seletar Royal Air Force military airfield site, the area now houses a new S$60 million Seletar Aerospace Park that spans 140 hectares. The aerospace park is expected to be completed in 2018 and will house industries specialising in aircraft maintenance and repair services. There are future plans to transform Seletar into one of the Singapore's regional centres, along with Jurong East, Tampines and Woodlands. Geography=Geographical extent According to the book Down the Seletar River: Discovering a Hidden Treasure of Singapore, Seletar generally refers to a region defined by the Ponggol River to the east, the Seletar River to the west, Ang Mo Kio to the south and the Straits of Johore to the north. It includes the areas covering Yio Chu Kang, Jalan Kayu, Lower Seletar Reservoir and a part of Upper Thomson. Seletar Planning Area Seletar Planning Area, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, shares a land boundary with planning areas of Sengkang to the south, riverine boundaries with Punggol to the east and Yishun to the west. Its northern boundary is made up by the Straits of Johor. Seletar Planning Area is officially divided into 4 subzones ‚Äì Seletar, Seletar Aerospace Park, Pulau Punggol Barat and Pulau Punggol Timor. History The area was home to the indigenous Malay population, especially the Orang Seletar (Malay for Seletar people) - a subgroup of Malay sea gypsies living on the waters of the island. There were already hundreds of them even before the arrival of Raffles. Seletar was originally a rubber plantation estate owned and managed by the Singapore United Rubber Plantations Ltd. In 1923, the Straits Settlement government bought from the Singapore United Rubber Plantations Ltd and gave it to the British Royal Air Force as a site for its military air base in Singapore. Construction of the airfield was completed in 1929 and it was officially opened in 1930. The airfield was the first RAF base east of India and had also served as a civilian airport until 1937, when Kallang Airport was opened to the public. The Seletar Reservoir (now known as Upper Seletar Reservoir), was first built in 1920, after the First World War to cope with the water demand in Singapore. It was marked as a conservation site in August 1999. The area is also dotted with colonial bungalows that were built for the military personnel of the RAF, which still stands today. In 2007, the government announced that some 174 bungalows has been set aside for demolition to make way for the new Seletar Aerospace Park, while the remaining 204 bungalows will be retained and some of these units will be converted into aerospace training schools and food and beverage outlets, while 131 units will be set aside for residential use.

K√∂ln had been interned in Boston on the outbreak of war in Europe and confiscated in April 1917 when the United States entered the war. The ship was under the control of the United States Shipping Board (USSB) that allocated commercial type ships to military or civilian use during the war. K√∂ln was renamed Amphion and operated by USSB for the Army as United States Army Chartered Transport (U.S.A.C.T.) Amphion as an animal transport taking mules, horses and general cargo to forces in Europe. At the end of the war the USSB allocated the ship to the Navy, which used the ship from April to September 1919 as a troop transport for returning the United States Expeditionary Force from Europe. The USSB contracted for the refurbishment of the ship after return by the Navy but the glut of war built ships, many new, resulted in Amphion lying idle from 1920 until sold for scrap in January 1924. Norddeutscher Lloyd K√∂ln K√∂ln was built in 1899 by J. C. Teckenborg A. G., Geestem√ºnde, Germany, for Norddeutscher Lloyd. The ship, signal letters QGTJ, was a , twin screw, awning deck type vessel of lighter construction in which the upper deck was not a full deck but a light covering deck above the main deck. There were two full decks. The ship was intended for the line's Baltimore and Galveston trade with limited cabin class accommodation and concentration on steerage passenger and cargo space. The ship was launched 24 July 1899 and placed in service 20 October 1899 on a voyage from Bremen to Galveston and on 21 December on initial service to Baltimore.

K√∂ln made her last voyage to Boston on 29 July 1914 before war and internment. World War I When World War I broke out in August 1914, K√∂ln was interned by the United States Government.

Amphion was the first animal transport to sail from the Chesapeake on 14 October 1917, with forage, 881 mules, 169 horses and general cargo. The transport, loaded with animals for the A.E.F., was approaching Brest alone on 30 October 1917 separated from a convoy in fog when a surfaced submarine was spotted close on the port bow. The bridge officer turned sharply toward the submarine, attempting to ram, and the forward gun got off three shots followed by the gun on the stern. Some shots seemed to be hits, and the gun crews were officially commended. Amphion was returning to the United States on 12 October 1918 when the German submarine attacked with gunfire in the Atlantic Ocean at . The first shot disabled Amphion's wireless, and the submarine fired about two hundred more rounds as Amphion fled, firing about seventy-two rounds in return, with one believed aboard to be a hit. The German fire riddled the upper works and destroyed five lifeboats before Amphion outran the submarine. Two of the ship's crew were killed, one lasting until landed at Bermuda, with the more seriously of the six surviving wounded, including two of the gunners, were landed for treatment. U.S.S. Amphion (April‚ÄîSeptember 1919) World War I ended on 11 November 1918. With the war over, Amphion was transferred to and commissioned by the United States Navy as USS Amphion (ID Number 1888) in April 1919. Between 21 May and 3 September 1919, USS Amphion journeyed thrice to France ‚Äì twice to St. Nazaire and once to Brest ‚Äì bringing home 6,410 American troops. Amphion was decommissioned at Brooklyn, New York, on 27 September 1919 and turned over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB) for disposition. Her name was simultaneously stricken from the Naval list. The USSB solicited bids for the extensive reconditioning work that would be required to make the vessel fit for civilian work as exclusively a cargo ship and let the contract to the lowest bidder in Providence, Rhode Island. Unforeseen work was found to be necessary, delaying the ship's return to fitness until 14 March 1920, when the ship left Providence and was returned to New York awaiting allocation. In January 1924, the USSB sold her to Boston Iron and Metal Company for $175,000 for scrapping.

It currently falls under the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. It is thought to have produced many large diamonds, known as Golconda Diamonds, several of which are or have been a part of crown jewels. The mine was established in the 16th century and operated until the 19th century. History Kollur Mine operated between the 16th and mid-19th centuries, and was one of the largest and most productive diamond mines on the Indian subcontinent. At the height of production, around 30,000 ‚Äì 60,000 people worked there, including men, women, and children of all ages. Kollur itself had a population of around 100,000. Golconda mines were owned by the king, but operation was leased to diamond merchants, either foreigners or Indians of the goldsmith caste. As well as rent, the king also received 2% from sales and he was entitled to keep all diamonds weighing over 10 carats. Mining at Kollur was crude, labour- intensive, and dangerous. Miners wore loincloths, slept in huts covered with straw, and were often given food instead of money. The pit walls had no timber supports and caved in after heavy rains, killing dozens of men at a time (women and children worked above ground). The area was evacuated in the 2000s to make way for the Pulichinthala irrigation project and is submerged by of water for most of the year. Geology The gravel-clay pits were a maximum depth of due to the high water table. The diamond-bearing seam was approximately thick. Alluvial workings covered an area long and between and wide. It was bounded to the east by an outcrop of the Nallamala Hills and to the north and west by a meander of the River Krishna. Most of the pits have since been filled up with scree, boulders, and eluvium from neighbouring hillsides. Notable finds The Tavernier Blue diamond was purchased by Jean- Baptiste Tavernier from the Kollur Mine in the mid-17th century. King Louis XIV of France bought the diamond from Tavernier, but it was stolen during the French Revolution; it reappeared and has been re-cut as the Hope Diamond. Other diamonds thought to have originated at Kollur include the Koh-i-Noor, the Great Mogul,Howarth, p. 62. the Wittelsbach-Graff, the Regent, the Daria- i-Noor, the Orlov, the Nizam, the Dresden Green, the Nassak. Location and maps Kollur Mine's location on the south bank of Krishna River is indicated at latitude 16¬∞ 42' 30\\" N and longitude 80¬∞ 5' Eat latitude on several maps created in the 17th and 18th centuries. All memory of its position was lost, until it was rediscovered in the 1880s by Valentine Ball, a geologist who helped to create this map of Golconda mines. In his annotated English edition of gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's book Travels in India (1676), Ball notes that ruins of houses and mine workings could still be found at Kollur. In the 1960s, Kollur Mine was pinpointed more accurately as being due north- east of Kollur village on the south bank of River Krishna at latitude 16¬∞ 43' N and longitude 80¬∞ 02' E, and extending for all the way up to Pulichinthala village.

It is located on an agricultural plain near the Lesser Caucasus Mountains. The word naftalan also means a petroleum product which can be obtained there. It is the center of a unique petroleum industry, with a grade of oil referred to as \\"Naftalan\\".Dr. D. Y. Huseinov and Dr. A. I. Rustamov, Naftalan: The Oil that Heals, Azerbaijan International, (3.4) Winter 1995, Accessed on December 4, 2006 Etymology The word Naftalan, can be traced to the Greek word \\"naphtha\\" (\\"ŒΩŒ¨œÜŒ∏Œ±\\"), meaning pertaining to oil, and the Azerbaijani suffix \\"-alan\\", which is of the verb \\"to take\\" (and literally meaning \\"oil buyer\\").Eldar Abbasov, Naftalan - The Miracle Oil: Azerbaijan's Therapeutic Oil, Azerbaijan International, (10.2) Summer 2002, Accessed on December 4, 2006 History Archaeological findings in the region date to the 12th century AD. Naftalan city was functioning as a settlement within the Goranboy and Yevlakh districts until 1967. On April 28, 1967, Naftalan was granted the status of subordinate city. The city of Naftalan consists of a city and two villages. The base of Naftalan city is Sanatorium - Resort infrastructure. Naftalan Resort has been operating since 1933. In 1938, the Naftalan Experimental Laboratory was established in the Azerbaijan Scientific-Research Institute of Medical Rehabilitation. The biological and therapeutic effects of the Naftalan oil began to be studied there. Also, in 1965, Scientific Research Laboratory was established in Naftalan.  Naftalan oil  Medical oil called Naftalan is produced in the city. The qualities of Naftalan oil has been known since early times; Marco Polo noted them. The oil in the area was known to people as far as China and India, and was traded by caravans throughout countries of the Near East. Nizami Ganjavi (1141-1209), mentioned the transportation of Naftalan oil on caravans from the Safikurd village in the Khamsa poem. Modern use of the oil has dated to the 1870s under Czarist Russia. By 1912, a German joint-stock company was founded to export and trade the oil, which was used as a treatment in the Russo-Japanese War. Research on the properties of the oil continues to be done at Azerbaijan Medical University and the Scientific Arthritis Center of Azerbaijan. German geographer E.I. Yeger played a major role in spreading and popularizing Naftalan oil in the world. He sent 800 grams of Naftalan oil to Germany to explore its composition. 600 doctors who have examined it have written about the importance of the oil. He drilled the first well in 1890 and built a small factory to process it. There he produced lubricant oil. After the First World War the factory stopped functioning and was destroyed. The Naftalan lubricant oil recipe disappeared with it. In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese used this oil as a first medical aid. During the Great Patriotic War, it was used to treat wounds. In 2010s, the number of hotels increased in the city after Azerbaijani government's tourism policy. Geography Naftalan city is located 330 km west of Baku, 50 km from Ganja in the foothills of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains. It's located at an altitude of 225 m above sea level. The spring is warm, the winter is soft here. The average annual temperature is +14.8 degrees. The wind in Naftalan is mainly monsoon. The city's territory is 35.73 km2.

Kramer, Bathing in Black Gold for Health and Profit in Azerbaijan, The New York Times, December 4, 2006. Oil from these spas is claimed to be an effective treatment against psoriasis, arthritis and rheumatism. At the height of their Soviet-era popularity, the spas in Naftalan had 75,000 visitors a year. The combination of violent ethnic conflict in nearby Nagorno-Karabakh and the end of Soviet- sponsored free trips brought the industry to its knees in the late-1980s. All but one of the older spas were converted into refugee housing. The remaining spa, the Naftalan Therapeutic Center, had 1,000-beds. The number of domestic and foreign tourists coming to Naftalan, which has a capacity of about 2200 tourists a day, has increased by 5-6 times in 2016 and counted 30,000.

She was the Minister of Communication and Culture until April 2014. She is also a feminist activist.Cinq femmes au gouvernement Biography Khalida Toumi was known as Khalida Messaoudi before she reclaimed her maiden name. She was born in 1958 in Ain-Bessem, Bouira, in the north of Algeria and entered the University of Algiers in 1977 to pursue a degree in mathematics. After graduating from the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, she taught mathematics until 1993. As a feminist activist, in 1981, she founded the Collectif f√©minin (Women's Grouping) not only to oppose the ministerial interdiction on Algerian women leaving the country unless accompanied by a male family member, but also to oppose state endorsement of the discriminatory Algerian Family Code, which the National Assembly eventually adopted in 1984. Following the adoption of this code, Toumi presided over the Association for Equality between Men and Women, founded by a group of Trotskyite militants. In 1985, Toumi co-founded and became a member of the executive committee of the Algerian League of Human Rights. She later distanced herself from the Trotskyite militants and in 1990 founded the Independent Association for the Triumph of Women's Rights. Toumi staunchly opposed Islamist ideology and endorsed cancellation of the January 1992 legislative elections, which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. She considered the FIS to display \\"absolutely all the classic ingredients of totalitarian populist movements.\\" She traveled to Western countries to provide an anti-Islamist and anti-terrorist perspective. A member of the Rassemblement pour la Culture et la D√©mocratie (RCD), she won a seat in the assembly and served as the RCD's national vice president for human rights and women's issues. After profound disagreements with the RCD's president Sa√Ød Sadi, she severed relations with the RCD in January 2001, at the peak of the crisis in her native Kabylie; she was subsequently expelled from the RCD. In May 2002, she became minister of culture and communication, as well as the government's spokesperson, the first woman ever to hold that job.

Often considered one of the greatest contributors to the divan tradition of Azerbaijani literature,\\"Fuzuli, Mehmed bin S√ºleyman\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Fuzuli in fact wrote his collected poems (divan) in three different languages: in his native Azerbaijani, Arabic and Persian.Peter Rollberg. The modern encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet literature (including Non-Russian and Emigre literatures) / Edited by Harry B. Weber. ‚Äî Academic International Press, 1987. ‚Äî Volume 8. ‚Äî Page 76. In Mesopotamia Fuzuli was in intimate contact with three cultures ‚Äî Turkic, Arabic, and Persian. Besides his native Azeri, he learned Arabic and Persian at an early age and acquired a through command of the literatures in all three languages, an accomplishment in which the cosmopolitan literary and scholarly circles of Hilla played an important role. He was well-versed in both the Ottoman and Chagatai Turkic literary traditions as well as mathematics and astronomy.\\"Fozuli, Mohammad b. Solayman\\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica Life Fuz√ªl√Æ is generally believed to have been born around 1480 in what is now Iraq, when the area was under Ak Koyunlu Turkmen rule; he was probably born in either KarbalƒÅ‚Äô or an-Najaf. He is believed to belong to Bayat tribe, one of the Turkic Oghuz tribes who were related to the Ottoman Kayƒ± clan and were scattered throughout the Middle East, Anatolia, and the Caucasus at the time. Though Fuz√ªl√Æ's ancestors had been of nomadic origin, the family had long since settled in towns. Fuz√ªl√Æ appears to have received a good education, first under his father‚Äîwho was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah‚Äîand then under a teacher named Rahmetullah.≈ûent√ºrk 281 It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani. Fuz√ªl√Æ showed poetic promise early in life, composing sometime around his twentieth year the important masnavi entitled Beng √º B√¢de (ÿ®ŸÜ⁄Ø Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿØŸá; \\"Hashish and Wine\\"), in which he compared the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II to hashish and the Safavid shah Ismail I to wine, much to the advantage of the latter. One of the few things that is known of Fuz√ªl√Æ's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \\"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\\".Quoted in Andrews, 236. Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word fuz√ªl√Æ‚Äîwhich literally means \\"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\\"‚Äîbecause he \\"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\\".Ibid. Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning‚Äîwhat is called tevriyye (ÿ™Ÿàÿ±ŸäŸá) in Ottoman Divan poetry‚Äîas Fuz√ªl√Æ himself explains: \\"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuz√ªl (ÔªìÔªÄÔªÆŸÑ) is given as a plural of fazl (ÔªìÔªÄÔªû; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as ‚Äòul√ªm (ÔªãÔª†ÔªÆŸÖ; 'sciences') and f√ºn√ªn (ÔªìÔª®ÔªÆŸÜ; 'arts')\\".Ibid. In 1534, the Ottoman sultan S√ºleym√¢n I conquered the region of Baghdad, where Fuz√ªl√Æ lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuz√ªl√Æ now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman patronage system, and he composed a number of kas√Ædes, or panegyric poems, in praise of the sultan and members of his retinue, and as a result, he was granted a stipend. However, owing to the complexities of the Ottoman bureaucracy, this stipend never materialized. In one of his best-known works, the letter ≈ûik√¢yetn√¢me (ÿ¥⁄©ÿßŸäÿ™ ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá; \\"Complaint\\"), Fuz√ªl√Æ spoke out against such bureaucracy and its attendant corruption: :ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ Ÿàÿ±ÿØŸÖ ÿ±ÿ¥Ÿàÿ™ ÿØ⁄ØŸÑÿØÿ± ÿØŸäŸà ÿ¢ŸÑŸÖÿßÿØŸâŸÑÿ± :Sel√¢m verdim r√º≈üvet deƒüildir dey√º almadƒ±lar.Kudret 189 :I said hello, but they didn't accept as it wasn't a bribe. Though his poetry flourished during his time among the Ottomans, the loss of his stipend meant that, materially speaking, Fuz√ªl√Æ never became secure. In fact, most of his life was spent attending upon the Tomb of \`Al√Æ in the city of an-Najaf, south of Baghdad.Andrews 237 He died during a plague outbreak in 1556, in KarbalƒÅ‚Äô, either of the plague itself or of cholera.

A page from the collected poems of Fuz√ªl√Æ Fuz√ªl√Æ has always been known, first and foremost, as a poet of love. It was, in fact, a characterization that he seems to have agreed with: :ŸÖŸÜÿØŸÜ ŸÅÿ∂ŸàŸÑ€å ÿßŸäÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖŸá ÿßÿ¥ÿπÿßÿ± ŸÖÿØÿ≠ Ÿà ÿ∞ŸÖ :ŸÖŸÜ ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇÿßŸÖ ŸáŸÖŸäÿ¥Ÿá ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≤ŸàŸÖ ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇÿßŸÜŸá ÿØ€åÿ± :Menden Fuz√ªl√Æ isteme e≈ü'√¢r-ƒ± medh √º zem :Men √¢≈üƒ±kam hem√Æ≈üe s√∂z√ºm √¢≈üƒ±k√¢ned√ºrTarlan 47 :Don't ask Fuz√ªl√Æ for poems of praise or rebuke :I am a lover and speak only of love Fuz√ªl√Æ's notion of love, however, has more in common with the Sufi idea of love as a projection of the essence of God‚Äîthough Fuz√ªl√Æ himself seems to have belonged to no particular Sufi order‚Äîthan it does with the Western idea of romantic love. This can be seen in the following lines from another poem: :ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇ ÿßŸäŸÖÿ¥ Ÿáÿ± ŸÜ Ÿàÿßÿ± ÔªãÔ∫éÔªùÔª¢ :ÔªãŸÑŸÖ ÿ®ÿ± ŸÇŸäŸÑ Ÿà ŸÇÿßŸÑ ÿßŸäŸÖÿ¥ ÿ¢ŸÜÿ¨ŸÇ :‚Äò√Ç≈üƒ±k imi≈ü her ne var ‚Äò√¢lem :‚Äòƒ∞lm bir k√Æl √º k√¢l imi≈ü ancakKudret 20 :All that is in the world is love :And knowledge is nothing but gossip The first of these lines, especially, relates to the idea of wahdat al-wuj≈´d (Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ¨ŸàÿØ), or \\"unity of being\\", which was first formulated by Ibn al-‚ÄòArabƒ´ and which states that nothing apart from various manifestations of God exists. Here, Fuz√ªl√Æ uses the word \\"love\\" (ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇ ‚Äòa≈ük) rather than God in the formula, but the effect is the same. Fuz√ªl√Æ's most extended treatment of this idea of love is in the long poem D√¢st√¢n-ƒ± Leyl√Æ v√º Mecnun (ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ŸÑŸäŸÑŸâ Ÿà ŸÖÿ¨ŸÜŸàŸÜ), a mesnev√Æ which takes as its subject the classical Middle Eastern love story of Layla and Majnun. In his version of the story, Fuz√ªl√Æ concentrates upon the pain of the mad lover Majnun's separation from his beloved Layla, and comes to see this pain as being of the essence of love. The ultimate value of the suffering of love, in Fuz√ªl√Æ's work, lies in that it helps one to approach closer to \\"the Real\\" (al-Haqq ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇ), which is one of the 99 names of God in Islamic tradition.

However, Kalbajar was deliberately excluded from the Nagorno- Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1923. As a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the area was occupied by Armenian forces on April 3, 1993.  Cultural monuments  Karvachar is rich in important Armenian cultural monuments, close to 750, which include monasteries, churches, chapels, fortresses, khachkars and inscriptions. The most important of them is the monastery of Dadivank. Under Armenian control The district was made into the Shahumyan Region, one of the 8 regions of NKR.

Other cast members include John Alexander, Charles Bronson, Peggy Cass, Barry Curtis, Tom Farrell, Frank Ferguson, Ruth Gordon (who co-wrote the screenplay with Garson Kanin), Gordon Jones, Madge Kennedy, Nancy Kulp, Mickey Shaughnessy, and Joan Shawlee. Plot summary The ups and downs of marriage and commitment are realized as Florence and Chet Keefer recount their marriage to the divorce judge. As the judge attempts to decipher whether or not their love for one another is gone, key moments of their lives together are recalled. Florence and Chet came close to making it big at various times, and suffered when those opportunities were lost. But worst of all was when they lost their oldest child through a freak accident. They deal with all the various frictions and pressures as well as they can, ending up with Florrie returning to work while Chet is recuperating from an injury. When Florrie's prior boss leaves her a lot of money in his will, Chet is concerned about what the context might have been. Their daughter makes them sing the Good Morning song while they're fighting, without any resolution. Things boil to a head, and suddenly everyone they know is weighing in on their relationship, and it seems divorce makes the most sense. After talking it all through with the Judge, they realize some issues have already been resolved. After the judge leaves, Florrie and Chet resolve to try again.

Narration The main way the action in this film happens is by narration, as Florence or Chet describe for the Judge different situations. However, as the viewer sees those scenes portrayed in the film, what they are seeing is different from what the narrator is describing. In the case of the story of how they met, what Chet describes is completely different from what is shown happening. '\\"It so happens I remember it different\\", Miss Holliday primly says.' Creative Process Garson Kanin told the Los Angeles Times that he and Ruth Gordon had a different writing process for The Marrying Kind than usual - they worked on it little by little over a period of months. They'd sketch out this or that scene to make a certain point. Then on a train ride they started compiling all their ideas, and found out they had 'far too much' material. '\\"Sometimes we rewrite each other's stuff,\\" Miss Gordon said, expressionlessly. \\"Every time I put in what I thought was a great joke, he cut it out.\\" \\"It wasn't that funny,\\" Kanin said.' Bosley Crowther of The New York Times notes that Miss Gordon and Mr. Kanin successfully convey their moral - 'that the natural and ever-hopeful chase after glittering, material ambition is a wistful and endless dream'. Critical response The Marrying Kind received mainly positive reviews. Mae Tinee of the Chicago Tribune described the film as having 'a great many funny situations and some expert dialog', while also capturing perfectly 'the frictions and frustrations which affect a middle class couple in what is aptly described as \\"a nervous world.\\"' The Deseret News notes the film as 'a heartwarming story of a young couple in love'. Marjory Adams of The Boston Globe positively noted the humor of certain scenes, but stated in conclusion that 'you would never wish to include Miss Holliday and Mr. Ray in your list of acquaintances. They would be too exhausting.' Bosley Crowther of The New York Times remarked on the successful hilarities, and the contrast between moments and the 'bittersweet comprehension of the thorniness of the way that stretches out for two young people after they have taken marriage vows.'

IV c.75) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom that gave free licence to doctors, teachers of anatomy and bona fide medical students to dissect donated bodies. It was enacted in response to public revulsion at the illegal trade in corpses. Background The 19th century ushered in a new-found medical interest in detailed anatomy thanks to an increase in the importance of surgery. In order to study anatomy, human cadavers were needed and thus ushered in the practice of grave robbing. Before 1832, the Murder Act 1752 stipulated that only the corpses of executed murderers could be used for dissection. By the early 19th century, the rise of medical science ‚Äì coinciding with a reduction in the number of executions ‚Äì had caused demand to outstrip supply. Around 1810, an anatomical society was formed to impress upon the government the necessity for altering the law. Among its members were John Abernethy, Charles Bell, Everard Home, Benjamin Brodie, Astley Cooper, and Henry Cline. The efforts of this body gave rise in 1828 to a select committee to report on the question. The report of this committee led to the Bill. Public revulsion at the recent West Port murders swayed opinion in favour of a change in the law. In 1831 public outcry at the activities of the London Burkers caused further pressure for a Bill. Passage of the Bill Public sentiment notwithstanding, there was substantial opposition to the Bill. In 1829 the Royal College of Surgeons petitioned against it, and it was withdrawn in the House of Lords owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Canterbury William Howley. A new Anatomy Bill was introduced in 1832. Though strongly opposed by Hunt, Sadler, and Vyvyan, it was supported by Macaulay and O'Connell. It was passed by the House of Lords on 19 July 1832. Provisions of the Act The Act provided that anyone intending to practise anatomy had to obtain a licence from the Home Secretary. Usually, one or two teachers in each institution took out this licence and hence were known as licensed teachers. They accepted responsibility for the proper treatment of all bodies dissected in the building for which their licence was granted. Regulating these licensed teachers, and receiving constant reports from them, were four inspectors of anatomy, one each for London, the rest of England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, who reported to the Home Secretary, and knew the whereabouts of everybody being dissected. The principal provision of the Act was section 7, which stipulated that a person having lawful possession of a body could permit it to undergo \\"anatomical examination\\" (dissection) provided that no relative objected. Most of the other sections were subsidiary, detailing the methods for carrying section 7 into effect. Also, section 16 repealed parts of sections 4 and 5 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828, which had consolidated several provisions from several earlier statutes and had retained the provision of 1752 that the bodies of murderers were to be hung in chains or dissected after execution. Section 16 provided instead that such bodies were to be either hung in chains or buried within the precincts of the last prison in which the deceased had been confined. The provision for hanging in chains was repealed by the Hanging in Chains Act 1834, and the whole section was repealed and replaced by section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The Anatomy Act provided for the needs of physicians, surgeons, and students by giving them legal access to corpses that were unclaimed after death ‚Äì in particular, corpses of those who had died in hospital, prison, or a workhouse. Further, a person could donate the corpse of a next of kin in exchange for burial at the expense of the anatomy school. Occasionally a person, following the example of Jeremy Bentham, left their own body for dissection in the name of the advancement of science; but even then, if the person's relatives objected, it was not received. Before the Act, anatomical research was difficult; for example, the anatomy of the nervous system was poorly understood. The Act was effective in ending the practice of resurrectionists, who robbed graves as a means of obtaining corpses for medical study. Mobs continued to protest against the Act into the 1840s, in the belief that it still failed to prevent the sale of paupers' bodies for medical research without their consent. An anatomical theatre in Cambridge was vandalised late in 1833 \\"by an angry mob determined to put a stop to the dissection of a man; this wave of popular protest alarmed the medical profession who resolved to hide its activities from the general public, and to a greater or lesser extent it has been doing so ever since\\".

Mendelsohn is a pioneer of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture, notably with his 1921 Mossehaus design. Biography Mendelsohn was born to a Jewishhttps://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-architect-erich- mendelsohn-is-born-1.5337156 family in Allenstein, East Prussia, Germany, now the Polish town of Olsztyn. His birthplace was at the former Oberstrasse 21, now no. 10 Staromiejska street. A plaque embedded on the wall on the side of Barbara street commemorates his place of birth.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/5,history/#footnote_6 He was the fifth of six children; his mother was Emma Esther (n√©e Jaruslawsky), a hatmaker and his father David was a shopkeeper.Erich Mendelsohn in Berlin He attended a humanist Gymnasium in Allenstein and continued with commercial training in Berlin. Einstein Tower in Potsdam In 1906 he took up the study of national economics at the University of Munich. In 1908 he began studying architecture at the Technical University of Berlin; two years later he transferred to the Technical University of Munich, where in 1912 he graduated cum laude. In Munich he was influenced by Theodor Fischer, an architect whose own work fell between neo-classical and Jugendstil, and who had been teaching there since 1907; Mendelsohn also made contact with members of Der Blaue Reiter and Die Br√ºcke, two groups of expressionist artists. From 1912 to 1914 he worked as an independent architect in Munich. In 1915 he married the cellist Luise Maas. Between 1910 and 1953 they corresponded with each other; these materials provide insight into the lives of an artist and couple who experienced a changing international landscape, including their fleeing from the Third Reich in Germany in 1933. Through his wife, he met the cello-playing astrophysicist Erwin Finlay Freundlich. Freundlich was the brother of Herbert Freundlich, the deputy director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (now the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in the Dahlem district of Berlin). Freundlich wished to build a suitable astronomical observatory to experimentally confirm Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Hat Factory in Luckenwalde Through his relationship with Freundlich, Mendelsohn had the opportunity to design and build the Einsteinturm (\\"Einstein Tower\\"). This relationship and also the family friendship with the Luckenwalde hat manufacturers Salomon and Gustav Herrmann helped Mendelsohn to an early success. From then until 1918, what is known of Mendelsohn is, above all, a multiplicity of sketches of factories and other large buildings, often in small format or in letters from the front to his wife, Louise Mendelsohn (n√©e Maas; 1895-1980). The 2011 documentary film by Duki Dror titled \\"Incessant Visions\\" is about Erich Mendelsohn and his wife, in which Dror animates the memoirs of Louise and the letters.Esther Zandberg, \\"Something Eternal\\" Haaretz, July 7, 2011. Architecture career At the end of 1918, upon his return from World War I, he settled his practice in Berlin. The Einsteinturm and the hat factory in Luckenwalde established his reputation. The Hat Factory was commissioned in 1921, Mendelsohn's design included four production halls, a boiler, a turbine house, two gatehouses and a dyeing hall. The dyeing hall became a distinctive feature of the factory, the building was shaped with a modern ventilation hood that expelled the toxic fumes used in the dyeing process. The structure even ironically resembled a hat.Architectuul As early as 1924 Wasmuths Monatshefte f√ºr Baukunst (a series of monthly magazines on architecture) produced a booklet about his work. In that same year, along with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, he was one of the founders of the progressive architectural group known as Der Ring. His practice employed as many as forty people, among them, as a trainee, Julius Posener, later an architectural historian. Mendelsohn's work encapsulated the consumerism of the Weimar Republic, most particularly in his shops: most famously the Schocken Department Stores. Nonetheless he was also interested in the socialist experiments being made in the USSR, where he designed the Red Banner Textile Factory in 1926 (together with the senior architect of this project, Hyppolit Pretreaus). His Mossehaus newspaper offices and Universum cinema were also highly influential on art deco and Streamline Moderne. Weizmann residence, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot In 1926, he bought an old villa, and in 1928, he designed Rupenhorn, nearly 4000 m¬≤, which the family occupied two years later. With an expensive publication about his new home, illustrated by Am√©d√©e Ozenfant among others, Mendelsohn became the subject of envy. De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill on Sea In the spring of 1933, in the wake of growing antisemitism and the rise of the Nazis in Germany, he fled to England. His assets were seized by the Nazis, his name struck from the list of the German Architects' Union, and he was excluded from the Prussian Academy of Arts. In England he formed an architectural practice with Serge Chermayeff, which continued until the end of 1936 and together they designed two important private houses - Cohen House and Shrubs Wood - and the De La Warr Pavilion, an entertainment and arts complex in the seaside town of Bexhill-on-Sea, commissioned and paid for by the local landowner. Mendelsohn had long known Chaim Weizmann, later President of Israel. At the start of 1934 he began planning on Weizmann's behalf a series of projects in Palestine during the British Mandate. In 1935, he opened an office in Jerusalem and planned Jerusalem stone buildings in the International Style that greatly influenced local architecture.Incessant Visions, Something Eternal In 1938 he dissolved his London office. At that same time he and his wife received British citizenship and he changed his name to \\"Eric\\"; the new citizenship also allowed them to issue guarantees and thus bring other family members to Britain.Artists in Exile In Palestine, Mendelsohn built many now-famous buildings: Weizmann House and three laboratories at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Anglo-Palestine Bank in Jerusalem, Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, Rambam Hospital in Haifa and others. From 1941 until his death, Mendelsohn lived in the United States and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. Until the end of World War II his activities were limited by his immigration status to lectures and publications. However, he also served as an advisor to the U.S. government. For instance, in 1943 he collaborated with the U.S. Army and Standard Oil in order to build \\"German Village\\", a set of replicas of typical German working-class housing estates, which would be of key importance in acquiring the know-how and experience necessary to carry out the firebombing of Berlin.Quoted by Mike Davis in Chapter 3 of his work Dead Cities. The original reference, according to this online version of the chapter, is \\"Design and Construction of Typical German and Japanese Test Structures at Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah\\" 27 May 1943, by the Standard Oil Development Company. In 1945, he established himself in San Francisco. From then until his death in 1953 he undertook various projects, mostly for Jewish communities.

Son of Robert Eduard Prutz (1816‚Äì1872), the essayist and historian, Hans was born at Jena, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, and was educated at the universities of Jena and Berlin. In 1865 appeared his monograph on Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, which was followed by three volumes on the emperor Frederick Barbarossa (Kaiser Friedrich I., Danzig, 1871‚Äì1874). Meanwhile from 1863 to 1873 he was teaching in secondary schools. In 1874 he received a government commission to undertake explorations in Syria, particularly at Tyre, and as a result be published in 1876 Aus Ph√∂nicien, a collection of historical and geographical sketches. In the same year appeared his first work on the Crusades, Quellenbeitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Kreuzz√ºge, and a series of monographs on the same subject culminated in 1883 in the notable Kulturgeschichte der Kreuzz√ºge. Then turning to a wider theme Prutz contributed to Oncken's university history the two volumes on the political history of Europe during the Middle Ages (Staatengeschichte des Abendlandes Im Mittelalter, Berlin, 1885‚Äì1887). In 1888 he reverted to a subject which he had touched upon in his Geheimlehre und Geheimstatuten des Tempelherrenordens (Danzig, 1879), translated into English as The Secret Teaching of the Knights Templar (2015), and wrote the history of the rise and fall of the Templars (Entwickelung und Untergang des Tempelherrenordens). His Preussische Geschichte (4 vols., Stuttgart, 1899‚Äì1902), which is perhaps his most notable work, is an attempt to apply scientific rather than patriotic canons to a subject which has been mainly in the hands of historians with a patriotic bias. He also wrote Aus des Grossen Kurf√ºrsten letzten Jahren (Berlin, 1897) and Bismarcks Bildung, ihre Quellen und ihre √Ñusserungen (Berlin, 1904). In 1902 Prutz resigned the chair of history in the University of K√∂nigsberg, which he had held since 1877, and took up his residence at Munich.

Despite never being released as a single due to its long duration, it became a staple of North American AOR-format FM radio stations in the 1970s and still receives airplay on classic rock radio today. Lyrics and composition The title refers to an inscription written by diminutive American actor Michael J. Pollard in Jim Capaldi's notebook while they were both in Morocco. Capaldi and Pollard were planning to work on a movie that was never filmed. Capaldi said: :Pollard and I would sit around writing lyrics all day, talking about Bob Dylan and the Band, thinking up ridiculous plots for the movie. Before I left Morocco, Pollard wrote in my book 'The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys'. For me, it summed him up. He had this tremendous rebel attitude. He walked around in his cowboy boots, his leather jacket. At the time he was a heavy little dude. It seemed to sum up all the people of that generation who were just rebels. The 'Low Spark', for me, was the spirit, high-spirited. You know, standing on a street corner. The low rider. The 'Low Spark' meaning that strong undercurrent at the street level.http://wnew.radio.com/2009/11/26/video- classics-the-low-spark-of-highheeled-boys-traffic/ The song begins with a gradual fade-in and ends with a slow fade-out. At 11 minutes and 41 seconds, it is the longest song on the album. The song (and the album) received wide praise, both in print and on broadcasts. It uses a sparse arrangement with a slow deliberate pace alternating with a double-time densely layered pop chorus. The verses are in D minor while the choruses modulate to D major with a repeated piano riff in D Minor. The song is noted for the extended solos played by band members in the later portions of the song. David Lubin wrote in his album review that appeared in Rolling Stone in 1972, \\"Each member of the group lays down a track or tracks which could in parts stand alone\\". Capaldi had originally written only two verses of lyrics. He quickly wrote the third verse while Winwood was recording the song's vocal and slipped it in front of him in time for him to sing it.Interview with Winwood and Capaldi on DVD interview included with CD version of The Last Great Traffic Jam. Recordings A live rendition of the song is the opening track on Traffic's only concert video, which was recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California on 21 February 1972, with the lineup of Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, Rebop Kwaku Baah (percussion), David Hood (bass), and Roger Hawkins (drums). Another live recording with the same lineup plus extra keyboardist Barry Beckett appears on the album On the Road. An alternate studio version of the song is available on the 2010 retrospective Revolutions ‚Äì The Very Best of Steve Winwood, both on the single disc and box set releases. The Revolutions version has a slightly longer running time of 12:26 as well as different solo arrangements relative to the original album recording.

Samuel Courtauld (7 May 1876 ‚Äì 1 December 1947) was an English industrialist who is best remembered as an art collector. He founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London in 1932 and, after a series of gifts during the 1930s, bequeathed his collection to the institute on his death. By the early 20th century, the Courtauld family business had become a major international company, having successfully developed and marketed rayon, an artificial fibre and inexpensive silk substitute. Samuel Courtauld took charge of the firm from 1908 as general manager and as chairman from 1921 to 1946. Personal life Courtauld was the son of Sydney Courtauld (10 March 1840 ‚Äì 20 October 1899) and Sarah Lucy Sharpe (1844‚Äì1906), and the great-nephew of textile magnate Samuel Courtauld. He was educated at Rugby School. After he finished school he visited Germany and France and studied textile technology to prepare to work in the family business. In 1901, he became director of one of the factories (in Halstead, Essex), then in 1908 the CEO of all plants of the company. He became interested in art after seeing the Hugh Lane collection on exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1917. However, his career as a collector started in 1922 following an exhibition of French art at the Burlington Fine Arts Club. Courtauld was one of the first collectors to display interest in French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. During the 1920s, he assembled an extensive collection including masterpieces by Vincent van Gogh (Self- Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Peach Blossom in the Crau previously owned by Anna Boch Anna Boch the woman that bought the only painting Vincent van Gogh sold during his lifetime Accessed 19 November 2012), √âdouard Manet (A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re), Paul C√©zanne (Montagne Sainte-Victoire) and Pierre- Auguste Renoir (La Loge). The core elements of his collection were acquired between 1926 and 1930, though his passion dwindled somewhat following the death of his wife Elizabeth (known as Lil) in 1931. Samuel founded the Courtauld Institute with Viscount Lee of Fareham and Sir Robert Witt in 1930. Courtauld provided the bulk of the finances for the founding of the Courtauld Institute. His wealth came from the textile business, but on both sides of his family there were connections with the arts and traditions of patronage going back several generations. Courtauld loved pictures and wrote poems about them. On the advice of Roger Fry and others he bought French Impressionists and C√©zannes and took out a lease on the best Robert Adam house in London, Home House, 20 Portman Square, in which to display them - a novel and stunning combination. His example was emulated by his younger brother Stephen, who converted the medieval ruins of Eltham Palace into an Art Deco mansion. Samuel Courtauld was the real Maecenas of the trio, and when his wife died in 1931, he made over the house in Portman Square, together with the pictures, for the use of the new institute until such time as permanent accommodation could be found for them. In the event the Portman Square house was to be the institute's home for almost sixty years.History of the Courtauld Institute Accessed 19 November 2012 Courtauld also created a ¬£50,000 acquisition fund for the Tate and National Gallery in London, helping lay the foundations of national collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. The graves of Samuel and Elizabeth Courtauld in Margate Cemetery, Kent Family Samuel Courtauld married Elizabeth Theresa Frances Kelsey on 20 June 1901. The children from this marriage included: Sydney Courtauld (1902-1954) married the politician Rab Butler. Samuel's younger brother, Stephen Courtauld, was also an arts patron and is remembered for his work on restoring Eltham Palace. Augustine Courtauld (1904-1959) Samuel's cousin was an explorer, noted for his pioneering observations of the climate of the ice cap of Greenland.

Although initially billed as a party to unite Australians of all ethnicities against racism, Unity failed to draw significant support outside Australia's East Asian ethnic communities. After the demise of Pauline Hanson as a political force, Unity has accordingly shifted its focus onto ethnic community affairs at a local government level. History=Formation Unity attracted much attention when it was founded in 1997, and ran candidates in almost every House of Representatives seat at the 1998 election. While they had hopes of winning a Senate seat in New South Wales with lawyer Jason Yat-Sen Li, he fell well short. However, the party outpolled the Australian Democrats and Australian Greens in some House of Representatives seats. In the NSW Federal seat of Fowler, investment banker Andrew Su outpolled both the Democrats and One Nation. Subsequently, in the 1999 NSW State Election, Su went on to poll more than the Liberals, Greens and Democrats in the safe Labor seat of Cabramatta. Decline As the Hanson movement began to disintegrate, it also negated Unity's main platform, and the party soon fell into internal tensions. The party's founder, Dr. Peter Wong, won a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council with just 1% of the vote. This came against the backdrop of a series of resignations, including that of Li. Wong soon stepped down as leader in favour of a white Australian in an attempt to broaden the party's base. Unity's activities largely died down throughout 2000 and Wong acted as a virtual independent in the Legislative Council. However, with the re-emergence of Hanson's One Nation party at the 2001 Western Australian state election, the party again came together and put together a large slate of candidates for the federal election that year. Despite having several prominent candidates (such as former Melbourne City Council member Wellington Lee in Victoria), they fell even further short of winning a seat in either house of federal parliament. After their failure to break into federal parliament in 2001, Unity largely shifted its attentions to local government, running a number of candidates for local councils in largely non-white areas, primarily in suburban Sydney. It did not run any candidates in the 2004 federal election. Wong continued to represent Unity in the NSW Parliament, until the expiry of his term in March 2007. At the March 2007 NSW state election, lead Unity Upper House candidate, Le Lam, won 1.2% of the vote, which was insufficient to gain election. Consequently, Unity no longer holds seats in any Australian parliament. The party did not contest the 2011 NSW state election although Pauline Hanson did. The party contested one New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat (Kogarah) in the 2015 state election, receiving 7.9% of the vote in that seat.

Robert Eduard Prutz (30 May 1816 ‚Äì 21 June 1872) was a German poet and prose writer. He was born at Stettin, modern day Szczecin. He studied philology, philosophy and history at Berlin, Breslau, and Halle, and in the last-named became associated, after taking his degree, with Arnold Ruge in the publication of the Hallesche Jahrb√ºcher. Subjected on account of his advanced political views to police surveillance, he removed to Jena, where, on the strength of an excellent monograph, Der G√∂ttinger Dichterbund (1841), he hoped to obtain an academic appointment. He was, however, expelled from the town for offending against the press laws, and it was not until 1846 that he received permission to lecture in Berlin. From 1849 to 1859 he was extraordinary professor of literature at Halle, but retired in 1859 to Stettin, where he died in 1872. Prutz belonged to the group of political poets who dominated German literature between 1841 and 1848; his poems are more conspicuous for their liberal tendency than their poetry. Among them may be mentioned Ein M√§rchen (1841); Gedichte (1841); Aus der Heimat (1858); Neue Gedichte (1860); Herbstrosen (i865); Buch der Liebe (1869). Among his novels are noteworthy, Das Engelchen (1851) and Der Musikantenturm (1855). Much more important are his contributions to literary history and criticism: Vorlesungen √ºber die Geschichte des deutschen Theaters (1847); Ludwig Holberg (1857); Die deutsche Literatur der Gegenwart (1859), and Menschen und B√ºcher (1862). Prutz also wrote some dramas of little merit. His son Hans Prutz was a notable historian.

KD involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The disease is named after the Danish neurologist Knud Krabbe (1885-1965). Signs and symptoms Symptoms in asymptomatic infantile- onset (<12 months after birth) and later-onset Krabbe disease present themselves differently. 85‚Äì90% of individuals with infantile-onset Krabbe disease display progressive neurologic deterioration in infancy and death before the age of two. Symptoms include irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties (like GERD), vomiting, staring episodes, and slowing of mental and motor development. In the first stages of the disease, doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of cerebral palsy. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, optic atrophy, optic nerve enlargement, blindness, paralysis, and difficulty when swallowing. Prolonged weight loss may also occur. 10‚Äì15% of individuals with later-onset Krabbe disease have a much slower disease progression. These individuals may also display symptoms such as esotropia, slurred speech, and slow development or loss of motor milestones. Causes Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern as seen in Krabbe disease Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene located on chromosome 14 (14q31), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mutations in the GALC gene cause a deficiency of an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. In rare cases, it may be caused by a lack of active saposin A (a derivative of prosaposin). The buildup of unmetabolized lipids adversely affects the growth of the nerve's protective myelin sheath (the covering that insulates many nerves) resulting in demyelination and severe progressive degeneration of motor skills. As part of a group of disorders known as leukodystrophies, Krabbe disease results from the imperfect growth and development of myelin. Galactosylceramidase deficiency also results in a buildup of a glycosphingolipid called psychosine, which is toxic to oligodendrocytes, a type of non-neuronal cell found in the nervous system, collectively termed neuroglia. Diagnosis There are a few ways to help pinpoint the presence of Krabbe disease. Newborn screening for Krabbe disease includes assaying dried blood cells for GALC enzyme activity and molecular analysis for evidence of GALC enzyme mutations. Infants displaying low enzyme activity and/or enzyme mutations should be referred for additional diagnostic testing and neurological examination. 0-5% GALC enzyme activity is observed in all symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease. High concentration of psychosine in dried blood spots may also be identified as a marker for Krabbe disease. A 2011 study discovered that individuals with Krabbe disease, more so in later-onset individuals, tend to have an abnormal increase in CSF protein concentration. The disease may be diagnosed by its characteristic grouping of certain cells (multinucleated globoid cells), nerve demyelination and degeneration, and destruction of brain cells. Special stains for myelin (e.g., luxol fast blue) may be used to aid diagnosis. New York, Missouri and Kentucky(KRS 214.155) include Krabbe in the newborn screening panel. Indiana will start screening in 2020. Treatment Although there is no known cure for Krabbe disease, bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to benefit cases early in the course of the disease. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation. A 15-year study on the developmental outcomes of children with Krabbe disease who underwent HSCT in the first seven weeks after birth found that patients have a better prognosis for both lifespan and functionality, with a slower progression of the disease. Even symptomatic individuals with later-onset Krabbe disease may benefit from HSCT if diagnosed early enough. Umbilical-cord blood is typically used as the source for the transplant stem cells. Management Symptom management can be particularly difficult for individuals with infantile onset, as symptoms tend to progress rapidly. Because there is no treatment for Krabbe disease, management of the condition is typically supportive and aimed at alleviating symptoms. Frequent evaluation is encouraged in order to anticipate the onset of, and preparation for, certain symptoms. Physical therapy can help to alleviate motor difficulties and increase strength, mobility, and flexibility. Gastrostomy tubes are used to circumvent feeding difficulties and prevent aspiration. A simultaneous gastrostomy tube insertion and Nissen fundoplication procedure is commonly performed to prevent the need for a secondary surgical procedure. Individuals with Krabbe disease with severe motor deficits tend to be more susceptible to overfeeding, as they require less calorie consumption and thus consume fewer calories than what caretakers may expect. There is also evidence that routine vaccines may accelerate disease progression; many individuals with Krabbe disease tend to not follow traditional vaccination procedures. Prognosis In infantile Krabbe disease, death usually occurs in early childhood. A 2011 study found one-, two-, and three-year survival rates of 60%, 26%, and 14%, respectively, with a few surviving longer. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer. Epidemiology This disease does not only impact humans, but other animals such as monkeys, mice, and dogs have been observed to develop Krabbe disease as well. While certain gene deletions are more frequent than others, novel mutations resulting in Krabbe disease have been discovered worldwide. Most commonly, the underlying cause of the disease is a deletion of a GALC gene, which causes a deficiency in the GALC enzyme. This is the circumstance in 80% of patients who have European and Mexican origins. The mortality rate of early infantile Krabbe disease is 90% before the age of two. Later onset of symptoms is associated with longer life expectancy, with older children generally surviving two to seven years after the initial diagnosis. Krabbe disease occurs in about one in 100,000 births. Because the disease is genetic, incidence rates vary widely from population to population. The incidence rate is extremely low in Japan, with between 5 and 10 cases per 1,000,000 live births. In the United States, Krabbe disease occurs in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 live births. Scandinavian countries report incidence rates of one in 50,000 births.Books.Google.com In certain communities Krabbe disease is much more frequent, such as the Druze community in Israel, which has an incidence rate of 6 out of every 1,000 live births. This higher rate is thought to be due in part to a high frequency of consanguineous marriages. Almost 35% of all Druze marriages were found to be between first-cousin familial relations. There have been no reported cases of Krabbe disease among the Jewish community. Time of onset also varies in frequency by location. Early infantile Krabbe Disease is the most common form of the disease overall, but Nordic communities tend to have even higher rates of early infantile onset Krabbe disease, while Southern European countries have higher incidences of late-onset cases. It is difficult to estimate the incidence of adult-onset Krabbe disease, due to discrepancies in labeling cases late-onset versus adult-onset. Society and culture Former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly has been a leader in gaining recognition and research funding for Krabbe disease following the diagnosis of his son, Hunter, in 1997. Hunter Kelly died of the disease on August 5, 2005, at the age of eight. Cove Ellis is a child from Georgia, United States who was diagnosed with the disease in early 2016. Ellis' family, along with her community, has worked to raise awareness of the disease and helped pass \\"Cove's Law\\", which provides parents the option to have prenatal screening for the disease, which can potentially save the child. Other animals Krabbe disease may also be found in cats and in dogs, particularly the West Highland White Terrier and Cairn Terriers.NYtimes.com See also *Maria Luisa Escolar *The Myelin Project *The Stennis Foundation References This article incorporates public domain text from the United States National Library of Medicine and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Its advocates regarded it as a part of the national Cumberland Road system. Congress passed a bill in 1830 providing federal funds to complete the project. Jackson vetoed the bill on the grounds that federal funding of intrastate projects of this nature was unconstitutional. He declared that such bills violated the principle that the federal government should not be involved in local economic affairs. Jackson also pointed out that funding for these kinds of projects interfered with paying off the national debt.Glyndon G. Van Deusen, The Jacksonian Era: 1828-1848 (Harper & Brothers, 1959) p. 52 Proponents of internal improvements, such as the development of roads and bridges, argued that the federal government had an obligation to harmonize the nation's diverse, and often conflicting, sectional interests into an \\"American System.\\" Jackson's decision was heavily influenced by his Secretary of State Martin Van Buren. Some authors have described the motives behind the veto decision as personal, rather than strictly political. The veto has been attributed to a personal grudge against Henry Clay, a political enemy and resident of Kentucky, as well as to preserve the trade monopoly of New York's Erie Canal, in Van Buren's case.Charles M. Wiltse, The New Nation: 1800-1845 (1961) p. 114 Debate in Congress Supporters of the bill insisted on the project's national significance. This particular project was intended to be a part of a much larger interstate system extending from Zanesville, Ohio, to Florence, Alabama. If the highway as a whole was of national significance, they argued, surely the individual sections must be as well.Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session. p. 433-435 (Sen. Tyler). p. 831-833 (Rep. Polk). They looked to the Supreme Court decision handed down six years before in Gibbons v. Ogden, in which the court confirmed the power to regulate commerce among the states including those portions of the journey which lay within one state or another. Additionally, the road connected the interior of Kentucky to the Ohio River, and therefore served as the main artery for the transportation of goods. Kentucky Representative Robert Letcher made this argument regarding the road's connection to the rest of the nation: > The road designed to be improved is intended to intersect at the great > national road in the State of Ohio. It connects itself also on each side > with the Ohio River. These two connections most certainly and justly entitle > it to the appellation of a national work.Congressional Debates, 21st > Congress, 1st Session. p. 820 (Rep. Letcher) Moreover, the federal government had provided funding for other intrastate projects when they benefited the rest of the nation. As Representative Coleman stated: > But gentlemen say, every inch of the Maysville road is in the State of > Kentucky. How can it be national? I answer, every inch of the Delaware > Canal, sixteen miles in length, is in the State of New Jersey; and every > inch of the Louisville Canal is in one county; nay, I believe in one city. > How can they be national? Yet, Congress have subscribed for stock in both of > them.Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session. p. 828 (Rep. > Coleman) These arguments were all intended to illustrate the road's overwhelming national significance. Opponents responded that this line of argument would establish that every road was a national road; there would be no limit to federal power.Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session. p. 831 (Rep. Polk) Jackson's veto Jackson believed that federal money should only be spent when carrying out Congress' enumerated powers. President Thomas Jefferson employed a broad view of the spending power when he carried out the Louisiana Purchase and the construction of the Cumberland Road. In contrast, President James Madison, the \\"Father of the Constitution‚Äù, viewed this type of spending as unconstitutional, as evidenced by his veto of the Bonus Bill of 1817. Jackson sided with Madison's view and felt that Jefferson's broad view of the spending power was not enough to justify passage of the bill before him. One of Jackson's main arguments against the bill was the project's provincial nature. It was understood that Congress could only fund projects which benefited the nation as a whole, but the Maysville project was \\"purely local matter:\\" > It has no connection with any established system of improvements; is > exclusively within the limits of a State, starting at a point on the Ohio > River and running out 60 miles to an interior town, and even as far as the > State is interested conferring partial instead of general advantages. Jackson was quick to clarify that this did not imply that he would approve of projects which were of \\"national\\" character. Even though there is not a constitutional argument to be made against this type of action, it would be unwise to do so at the time, given the public debt. Until the debt was paid off, there would be no surplus to spend on these projects. Generally, Jackson supported internal improvements. During his first term, he sanctioned federal expenditures for transportation projects at a rate nearly double that of the expenditures under President John Quincy Adams.Van Deusen p. 52 It was seen as good policy to spend federal money on national improvements, as long as two conditions were met. First, they should be done pursuant to a general system of improvement, not by ad hoc legislation. Second, the Constitution should be amended to make clear the limits on federal power.David P. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: Democrats and Whigs, 1829-1861 (U of Chicago Press, 2005). Some scholars argue that Jackson's veto can be seen as largely driven by personal, rather than political motives, particularly given Jackson's approval of internal improvement bills with as much a local nature as the Maysville Road. Jackson's veto may have been one of the many manifestations of the rivalry between Jackson and Henry Clay, who was one of the major proponents of the Maysville Road as part of his American System. Because the Maysville Road Project was of a local nature, the veto did not encounter resounding opposition in Congress. In fact, the veto would please voters in New York and Pennsylvania who were responsible for financing their own projects, and saw no reason to help fund similar projects in other states. It also appealed to Southern states' rights supporters who had no need for canals or new roads. For Jackson, this decision underscored his belief that the construction of roads and canals lay more within the realm of the states rather than the federal government. This belief in limiting the federal government's scope of action was to be one of the tenets of Jacksonian democracy. In 1846 President James K. Polk, an admirer and follower of Jackson, vetoed the Rivers and Harbors Bill on similar grounds. Henry Clay and his Whig Party, in contrast to Jackson, supported both the 1830 and 1846 bills because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.Michael Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party (1999), 232‚Äì37 U.S. Route 68 While Henry Clay and the Whig Party lost the argument, the two positions represented by the Maysville Road veto continued to face each other into the future. A route that closely approximated the surveyed right-of-way for the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike received substantial federal aid in the 20th century and would be designated as part of U.S. Route 68. This aid and designation represented a reversal of the principles set forth by Jackson in his 1830 veto.

In 1971, Churchill played a major role in the development of the Glastonbury Festival. In 1979, she set up the Children's Area of the Festival and also the Theatre Area. Until her death, she ran the Theatre and Circus Fields. Her duties in the 2007 festival involved the booking and management of some 1500 separate acts. She also founded and was the director of the Children's World charity. Life Churchill was born in London to Randolph Churchill (son of Sir Winston Churchill) and his second wife June Osborne (daughter of Colonel Rex Hamilton Osborne), and was half-sister to Winston Churchill, who was born to Randolph Churchill and his first wife Pamela Beryl Digby, better known as Pamela Harriman.Burke's Peerage 1999, page 1869 She appeared, at the age of two, in the portrait of Winston Churchill and his family which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. She went to Fritham School for Girls, where she was Head Girl, and then Ladymede school, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. She worked at Lepra, the charity for leprosy sufferers, and then briefly at London Weekend Television. In March 1954, then 4-year-old Churchill appeared on the cover of Life as part of a feature on possible future spouses of then 5-year-old Prince Charles. In 1967 she was 'Debutante of the Year,' appeared in January UK Vogue feature 'Youthquakers Face '67' photographed by Norman Parkinson, met the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr. in America, and was romantically linked, during 1970, with Crown Prince Carl, the future King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. In 1971 she was invited to represent Britain at the Norfolk International Azalea Festival in Virginia, established in 1953 after NATO's Allied command was established there. Each year a NATO country is honoured, and invited to send a beautiful \\"Azalea Queen\\" as its ambassador. Churchill refused to go, indicating in a letter she believed in the goals of the peace movement, and was horrified by the Vietnam War. Chased through London by a surprised press, she left instead for rural Somerset, where she helped lead the first full-scale incarnation of the Glastonbury Festival with Andrew Kerr, Thomas Crimble, Michael Eavis and many others. During the 1970s she embraced the alternative culture of the time, which included living for a time in a squat but later worked and lived on a farm. She granted a rare interview to Rolling Stone magazine. In 1979 Churchill and Kerr were again in charge of the festival, and from then on her administration continued alongside Eavis and Kerr, along with the founding and leading of the charity Children's World and work as a fundraiser. In 1972 she married Jim Barton, and in 1973 had a son, Nicholas Jake. In 1987 she met her second husband, a juggler, Haggis McLeod, and in 1988 they had a daughter, Jessica. She embraced Tibetan Buddhism through the teachings of Sogyal Rinpoche, author of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. Death A bridge, dedicated to Arabella Churchill, over the Whitelake River on the site of the Glastonbury Festival Dedication plaque on \\"Bella's Bridge\\" On Thursday 20 December 2007, Churchill died at St Edmund's Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury, Somerset, aged 58. She had suffered a short illness due to pancreatic cancer, for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Arrangements following her death reflected her Buddhism, and included a parade and simple farewell on the final evening of the Glastonbury Festival in June 2008. Festival organiser Michael Eavis, paying tribute to Churchill after her death, said \\"Her energy, vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a place in our festival history second to none.\\" In 2010 Michael Eavis received a donation from British Waterways of timber from the old gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire. This was used to construct a new bridge, dedicated to Churchill's memory, at the Glastonbury Festival site.

Its use has also since been expanded to include convenience stores, department stores, supermarkets, taxis, and other retailers since 1 April 2010. Like conventional electronic fare systems, the card employs RFID technology to operate without physical contact. They are available for purchase at all Metro stations and all chain convenience stores. History The Taipei Smart Card Corporation was established in 2000 with a total capitalization of NT$700 million. Shareholders include the Taipei City Government, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, banks, bus companies, and other companies. Promotional trials of the card began in 2001, and the card was officially released in 2002. In 2008, the company changed its name to the EasyCard Corporation to increase branding and visibility. By April 2016, the company had issued over 60 million cards. EasyCard transactions now account for 91% of Taipei Metro system transactions, 92% of bus transactions, and 71% of parking lot transactions. Daily transactions reached 3.1 million in 2009. Brand The name EasyCard was chosen in a contest where the general public was asked to propose names. In Mandarin Chinese the card is known as ÊÇ†ÈÅäÂç° (Pinyin: Y≈çu-y√≥u K«é), which literally means Easy Travel Card. The logo, designed by Y&P; Design Group, is composed of four different colored logos radiating outward, each representing something different: technology and unhindered travel, sustainable development, commitment, and efficiency. In 2003, the EasyCard logo won the 20th American Corporate Identity Award of Excellence. Card usage=Taipei Metro Users of the card on the Taipei Metro are required to pass the card over the EasyCard sensor area on fare gates both entering and exiting the stations; the first pass registers the start of the journey and the second as the end. Fares deducted from the card depend on the distance traveled and whether a public bus was used within a transfer time frame (currently, one hour). Beginning in 2020, travelers using an IC Card such as EasyCard on Taipei MRT trains will receive a rebate of between 10-30% on all Taipei MRT fares, with the discount percentage based on the number of rides taken during the month. The rebate amount is deposited onto the IC card the next time the traveler uses the card on the Taipei MRT after the end of the respective month, but the rebate must be collected within six months. Prior to the current rebate scheme, IC card users were instead given an automatic 20% discount off every published fare.https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/02/2003730230 The EasyCard can also be used for the Maokong Gondola without any discounts. Taoyuan Metro The EasyCard are available for each station of the Taoyuan Airport MRT. Using the card to shuttle between the three stations from A12 station (Airport Terminal 1) to A14a station (Airport Hotel) are free. Kaohsiung Metro Users of the card can use the card on the Red and Orange Lines of the Kaohsiung Metro. Fares deducted from the card depend on the distance traveled and a 15% discount over single journey tokens, which is the same as iPASS. The Circular light rail enabled EasyCard usage from February 2018. The EasyCard can be add-valued only at the information center of each station of Kaohsiung Metro. The add-value machines are scheduled to enable EasyCard add-value function in May 2018. Taiwan Railway Administration The EasyCard are available for all stations of TRA. Passengers holding the card can take all of the train of TRA, except Taroko Express, Puyuma Express, group trains, tourism trains, and specified operating trains. There is a 10% discount if the travelling distance is less than 70 km. An EasyCard reader on a New Taipei City bus. Buses The EasyCard can be used on most city bus systems and several inter-city bus in Taiwan. Several route might not be accepted. In Taipei, passengers using Adult cards (including co-branded credit cards and debit cards), Student cards, or Concessionaire (Welfare) cards to transfer between Metro and bus within one hour, receive an NT$8, NT$6 and NT$4 discount respectively. The EasyCard machine prevents repeated transactions on the same card until the bus travels into the next paying section. In Taichung, users can enjoy a 10-kilometer free ride. Taxis A trial allowing the payment of taxi fares with the card was carried out in 2005 but this payment option was not then implemented on a wider level for taxi journeys. Parking The EasyCard are accepted in government-run parking lots and some privately run parking lots. Parking meters accept Easy Cards exclusively, charged in quarter-hour increments, and expire in due time like a normal meter. In addition to being usable on the Taipei Metro and buses, the EasyCard is also accepted at public garages adjacent to Metro stations and in other areas of Taipei. As of 2008, the EasyCard can be used to pay for boat rides in areas such as Tamsui. Designated retailers As of 1 April 2010, EasyCards can now be used to pay for purchases at some stores including 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Cosmed, OK Mart, Hi-Life, Starbucks, and Pacific SOGO. The EasyCard can now be used at over 10,000 retail outlets throughout Taiwan. In 2011, card usage is expected to be expanded to gas stations and fast food chains. Other uses In addition to payment, the EasyCard has also been used as a multifunctional card. At the 2010 World Model UN Conference held in Taipei, the card served as a ticket, meal coupon, and identification card (in addition to its regular uses). Limited edition cards have also been sold to raise money for charity. Other areas of use In addition to paying for public transit, parking, and select retailers, the EasyCard can also be used for: *Most buses in multiple areas in Taiwan *Ferries (Taipei Blue highway). *Admission into the Taipei Zoo, and a some museums, festival activities and recreational areas. *Library cards, allowing the user to borrow materials from Taipei or Yilan Public Libraries. *Digital IDs, including Student ID Cards. *YouBike bicycle sharing system. (Registration with the U Bike system with registered mobile telephone is required) Payment and recharge EasyCards can be used for purchases of up to NT$1,000 at available stores once, up to a maximum of NT$3,000 per day. This limit does not apply to payment of government fees, public service charges, medical costs, transport services (including recreational services like the Maokong Gondola or bicycle rental), miscellaneous school expenses, and parking fees. Value can be recharge in multiples of NT$100 and each card can hold up to NT$10,000 of value. For consumer safety, all money from EasyCard deposits are held in the EasyCard Prepaid Trust Fund managed by Cathay United Bank. All deposits are protected by a full refund guarantee issued by the managing bank. If a card has not been used for over two years, a recharge must be made before the card will be reactivated. The balance on a card can be checked on the scanner unit whenever a transaction is made or using an EasyCard Reader located at all Taipei Metro stations. Types of cards *Adult: These standard fare cards cost NT$500, inclusive of a NT$400 balance and NT$100 deposit. Purchase and add-value are available at all Taipei Metro stations, bus stations, and most convenience stores. The card can be credited to a maximum of balance of NT$10,000. Unused fees and the deposit are refundable. *Student: These cards costs the same amount (NT$500), but can only be purchased from station staff with appropriate student identification. The pricing model remains the same on the Metro but is discounted on public buses at NT$12 rather than NT$15. Cardholders after October 2015 will not receive the $3 NT discount on public buses according to EasyCard Corp. Note: As of 1 May 2010, at certain convenience store chains (7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Hi-Life, OK Mart), Adult and Student cards may be purchased with NT$200 (NT$100 balance and NT$100 deposit). *Concessionaire: These cards are reserved for children (under eligible legislation), seniors over 65 years of age, and disabled persons.

The pass is sold as a one-day, two-day, three-day, or five-day pass. It expires on midnight of the expiry date. Buses that accept the card will display a TaipeiPass identification sticker. Debit and co- branded credit cards Joint-branded cards allow for an EasyCard to be linked with a credit or ATM account to automatically add value. This allows for consumers to pay for products, services, or government fees with the card. The option remains popular with users in spite of handling fees and a limit of how much money can be added per day (NT$500). Auto-recharge applied to debit card to make up to 3 times of each NT$500 at all Designated retailers and value- adding machine at Metro stations Mobile device integration Several attempts have been made to embed EasyCard radio chips into mobile devices, enabling \\"transactions by phone.\\" Users are not billed by their telecommunications accounts; rather, they can read transaction records and check balance using a supported mobile phone. Security attacks As the value of an EasyCard can be used for transactions of scarce services and products, security measures are important. EasyCard uses multiple encryption techniques to prevent illegal modification of values and hacking. At the 27th annual German Chaos Communication Congress hacker conference (\\"27C3\\") in 2010, German free software programmer Harald Welte showed that it is possible to artificially change the amount of money stored on a first-generation EasyCard ‚Äîbased on the MIFARE Classic chip‚Äî using nothing more than a USB RFID reader and a laptop computer running open source software. Welte denounced the system for its poor choice of cipher and lack of user authentication. He was able to map out and manipulate the card's internal format in 2 days on a trip in Taiwan. Alt URL However, hacking the EasyCard remains illegal, and in September 2011 a 24-year-old engineer was arrested on suspicion of fraudulently using a hacked EasyCard. EasyCard has since addressed several of the weaknesses in later card hardware revisionsContactless Smartcard Technology Needs More Security but remains vulnerable to several known attacks on the cryptography of MIFARE Classic that cannot be addressed without breaking backwards compatibility to existing infrastructure Meijer, Carlo & Verdult, Roel. (2015). Ciphertext-only Cryptanalysis on Hardened Mifare Classic Cards. 18-30. 10.1145/2810103.2813641.. Reception The EasyCard has been very popular since its launch in 2002. By 2010, over 23 million cards had been issued.(The source did not say what cards have returned as subpriced) By 2014, more than 50 million cards have been issued. Critics have called for stronger measures to promote name registration of EasyCards in order to protect consumer rights. Over NT$600 million is lost yearly in lost cards. As of 2009, less than 0.02% of cards had been registered.

It is situated west of Robinson Crusoe Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The Archipelago was home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk from 1704 to 1709, and is thought to have inspired novelist Daniel Defoe's fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel about the character (although the novel is explicitly set in the Caribbean, not in the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands). This was just one of several survival stories from the period that Defoe would have been aware of. To reflect the literary lore associated with the island and attract tourists, the Chilean government renamed the place Alejandro Selkirk Island in 1966.  Geography  A view of Alejandro Selkirk Island The Masafuera rayadito is endemic to Alejandro Selkirk The extinct Alejandro Selkirk firecrown, Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi The island measures north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest, and has an area of . It is densely wooded and very mountainous and is marked by ridges and numerous deep ravines lead to a steep, rugged coast on the east side of the island off which are tremendous depths. The coastal cliffs are up to high. The south, west and north sides of the island have sandy strips of beach which extend offshore in places. The highest peak, Cerro de Los Inocentes, rises to in the southwest part of Alejandro Selkirk Island, where there is also a prominent rock with a hole through it. Landing is possible near the center of the east shore at Quebrada S√°nchez (S√°nchez Ravine), and at the foot of Quebrada Las Casas (La Casas Ravine) ), where there is a boat slip and buildings of the former penal colony. Anchorage can be taken about east-northeast of Quebrada S√°nchez (), in depths of to . The ravine is recognized by a white patch on a hill near it. Anchorage can also be taken, in depths of to , with sand bottom, off Rada de la Colonia.Sailing Directions Enroute, Vol. 125, West Coast of South America Dating of rocks on the island show that it is the youngest of the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands at an age of 1 ‚Äì 2 million years old. Due to its young age, the island shows little evidence of erosion. According to some early reports, now disputed, about southwest of the island is the submerged Sefton Reef (), almost reaching sea level, and to northwest, Yosemite Rock (). Podesta Island, once reported to lay farther to the west, is a phantom island. Climate Alejandro Selkirk has a subtropical climate, moderated by the cold Humboldt Current and the southeast trade winds. Temperatures range from to , with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler. Average annual precipitation is , varying from to year to year. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above experience almost daily rainfall.  Flora and fauna  The Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal is known to have existed during the late 17th century on the island with the population of the seals on Alejandro Selkirk Island and Robinson Crusoe Island believed to be in excess of four million by the late 17th century. A census of 1797 estimated a population 2 ‚Äì 3 million fur seals. The species was hunted to near extinction by the 19th century and was thought to be extinct for 100 years until 200 were found on the island in 1965. Since then, the population has grown steadily at 15% to 20% every year. The Masafuera rayadito is endemic to Alejandro Selkirk and one of the rarest South American birds with only 140 individuals left.Gonzalez J. (2014). Phylogenetic position of the most endangered Chilean bird: the Masafuera Rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae; Furnariidae). Tropical Conservation Science. 7:677‚Äì689. The Alejandro Selkirk firecrown Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi an endemic subspecies of the Juan Fern√°ndez firecrown became extinct in 1908 by feral goats and other introduced animals. The flora on the island is in the Fernandezian Region Floristic Region, in the Antarctic Floristic Kingdom, but often also included within the Neotropical Kingdom. Endemic plant families include Lactoridaceae, with endemic plant genera also found.  History  Throughout much of its history, the island has been uninhabited. There was formerly a penal settlement along the middle of the east coast, at . About 20 buildings can be made out on detailed satellite images.Satellite image The settlement was operative from 1909. It initially housed 190 criminals, while there were as many as 160 political prisoners from 1927 to 1930. The penal colony was abandoned in 1930. Recently, the island has seen regular settlement, with 57 people living on the island as of the 2012 census. In 1966 the Chilean government renamed Isla M√°s Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island, with Isla M√°s a Tierra becoming Robinson Crusoe Island. Alexander Selkirk was a Scottish sailor who was marooned as a castaway on M√°s a Tierra (then uninhabited) from 1704 to 1709. His story of survival likely inspired the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. In popular culture The author Jonathan Franzen wrote an essay in The New Yorker about his brief stay on the island while mourning the suicide of his friend and fellow author David Foster Wallace, some of whose ashes Franzen scattered on the island.

The head is typically made of nylon and is normally very tightly tuned in order tore and a minimum of sustain. The drum is devoid of snares or jingles. They are frequently confused with the more common tambourine. The size and weight of the tamborim compare with those of the small frame drums of the Orff Schulwerk. The tamborim is used in many genres of Brazilian music. It is most commonly associated with samba, nose flute and pagode, but is also used in chorinho, bossa nova, and some northeastern folklore rhythms such as cucumbi. It is also played in samba music and in carnivals or festivals. Technique Tamborim live performance In most musical styles, the tamborim is played with a small wooden drumstick. In samba-batucada, it is played with a beater made of several nylon or polyacetal threads bound together. On rare occasions, it may be played with the fingers. The tamborim is held with the weaker hand with the thumb either crossing the rim and resting on the drumhead, or gripping the frame. The other fingers are curled under the rim, with the index typically applying and releasing pressure on the underside of the head to achieve higher or lower notes. The beater is held with the strong hand and the head is struck a little off-center. A playing technique called virado is often used, in which the drum is flipped upside-down in the middle of the pattern, which produces one note that is slightly delayed, giving the samba its characteristic lilt. The instrument may also occasionally be struck on the rim. Tamborim players alternate between the carreteiro, the main groove pattern, and other signature phrases which are easily distinguished above the other percussion instruments.

He was the son of Guy III of Spoleto and Ageltrude, born in San Rufino. He was the last ruler to issue a capitulary in the Carolingian tradition. Confronting Arnulf Lambert was crowned King in May 891 at PaviaCarpegna Falconieri and joint Emperor alongside his father on 30 April 892 at Ravenna by a reluctant Pope Formosus.Comyn, pg. 82 He and his father signed a pact with the pontiff confirming the Donation of Pepin and subsequent Carolingian gifts to the papacy.Mann, III, pg. 378 In 893, however, Formosus sent an embassy to Regensburg to request Arnulf of Carinthia liberate Italy and come to Rome to be crowned.Mann, IV, pg. 50 Arnulf sent his son Zwentibold with a Bavarian army to join with Berengar of Friuli. They defeated Guy, but bribes, along with an outbreak of fever, saw him leave in the autumn.Mann, IV, pg. 51 Arnulf then personally led an army across the Alps early in 894. He conquered all of the territory north of the Po River, but went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn. Lambert became sole king and emperor, as well as succeeded his father to the Duchy of Spoleto. Still young though, he was left under the regency of his mother, a staunch anti-German. While Berengar occupied Pavia, Lambert and Ageltrude travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial title, but Pope Formosus wanted instead to crown Arnulf and was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Lambert was preoccupied in thwarting the attempts of both Arnulf of Carinthia and Berengar of Friuli to take Italy for themselves during his reign. Early on, Adalbert II of Tuscany rallied to his cause, menacing Berengar in Pavia. By January 895, Lambert could take up residence in the royal capital. In that same year, his cousin Guy IV conquered the Principality of Benevento from the Byzantines. Despite the urging of Fulk of Rheims on his behalf, Lambert found himself abandoned by the pope, who feared the increased power of the Spoletan house. In September, an embassy arrived in Regensburg beseeching Arnulf's aid. In October, Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy. He crossed the Alps quickly and took Pavia, but then he continued slowly. While Lambert refused to offer battle, Arnulf was garnering support among the nobility of Tuscany. Even Adalbert joined him. Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude, he took the city by force on 21 February 896, freeing the pope.Mann, IV, pg. 52 Arnulf was there crowned King and Emperor by Formosus, who declared Lambert deposed. Arnulf marched on Spoleto, where Ageltrude had fled to Lambert, but Arnulf suffered a stroke and had to call off the campaign.Mann, IV, pg. 53 That same year, Formosus died, leaving Lambert once again in power. Renovatio regni Francorum After Arnulf returned to Germany and until his death, Lambert and his supporters, most powerful in the northeast and the centre of the peninsula, were in complete control of Italy. He retook Pavia and decapitated Maginulf, Count of Milan, who had joined Arnulf. In October and November, he met Berengar outside of Pavia and the two reached an agreement whereby they parcelled the kingdom out between them, Berengar keeping the realm between the Adda and the Po and Lambert the rest.Sismondi, History of the Italian Republics in the Middle Ages, pg. 24 They shared Bergamo. This was a confirmation of the status quo of 889. Lambert also pledged to marry Gisela, Berengar's daughter. It was this partitioning which caused the later chronicler Liutprand of Cremona to remark that the Italians always suffered under two monarchs. In early 897, Lambert journeyed to Rome with Ageltrude and Guy to receive reconfirmation of his imperial title.Mann, IV, pg. 80 The vengeful Lambert and Ageltrude also persuaded Pope Stephen VI, elected by their influence, to put the corpse of Formosus on trial for various crimes. The body, stripped of its papal robes and mutilated, was thrown into the river Tiber after the \\"Cadaver Synod.\\"Mann, IV, pg. 82 In January 898, Pope John IX rehabilitated Formosus against their will. Lambert convened a diet at Ravenna in February. Seventy bishops met and confirmed the pact of 891, the invalidity of Arnulf's coronation, and the validity of Lambert's imperial title.Mann, IV, pg. 95 They legitimised the election of John IX. They also solved the Formosan question and confirmed his rehabilitation.Mann, IV, pg. 94 Most significantly for Lambert, however, they reaffirmed the Constitutio Romana of Lothair I (824), which required the imperial presence at papal elections. Lambert hereafter governed with the church and continued the policy of his father of renovatio regni Francorum: renewal of the Frankish kingdom. He was able to issue capitularies in the Frankish fashion as his father had done. In fact, he was the last ruler to do so. In 898, he legislated against the exploitation of the services owed by arimanni to create benefices for vassals. The Lex Romana Utinensis was composed at his court. His rule was recognized in Benevento after the restoration of Prince Radelchis II in 897.Kreutz, pg. 178 Battle of Marengo However, Lambert still had to face Berengar of Friuli and the rebellious Adalbert of Tuscany.Mann, IV, pg. 87 In 898, the latter marched on Pavia. The emperor, who had been hunting near MarengoMann, IV, pg. 97 south of Milan, was given advance word. Lambert surprised and defeated his rival at Borgo San Donnino, taking him prisoner to Pavia. On his return to Marengo however, he was killed, either by assassination (by Hugh, son of Maginulf), a theory about which Liutprand, our primary source, is reserved, or by falling from his horse. He was buried in Piacenza. Liutprand remembered him as an elegans iuvenis and vir severus: \\"an elegant youth and a stern man\\". His epitaph (in Latin elegiac couplets) is: {:Sanguine pr√¶cipu≈ç Franc≈çrum germinis ortus :Lambertus fuit hƒ´c Caesar in Urbe potƒìns :Alter erat C≈çnstantƒ´nus, Theod≈çsius alter :Et prƒ´nceps pƒÅcis clƒÅrus am≈çre nimis  :Born with the distinguished blood of the stock of the Franks, :Lambert was here Emperor, holding power in the City (of Rome); :He was another Constantine, another Theodosius, :and a prince of peace, excessively renowned with love. } He was succeeded in Spoleto by Guy IV while the regnum Italicum and the imperium Romanum were thrown into chaos, contested by multiple candidates.Mann, IV, pg. 98 Within days, Berengar had taken Pavia.

She was named for Spiegel Grove, the home and estate in Fremont, Ohio of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th President of the United States. Career Spiegel Grove was laid down on 7 September 1954, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss., launched on 10 November 1955; sponsored by Mrs. Webb C. Hayes, and commissioned on 8 June 1956, Captain S. Filippone in command. Spiegel Grove sailed for Hampton Roads and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 July 1956. She headed for the Guantanamo Bay area on her shakedown cruise on 26 July 1956 and returned on 15 September. The ship was in the yard during October 1956; then in November she participated in amphibious exercises off Onslow Beach, North Carolina. On 9 January 1957, Spiegel Grove, with other ships of Transport Amphibious Squadron 4 (TransPhibRon 4), sailed from Morehead City, North Carolina, with elements of the 6th Marines embarked, for a tour with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She returned to Norfolk on 3 June and operated along the east coast for the remainder of the year. In November, she transported 364 Army troops to Labrador. In January 1958, the LSD was deployed with her squadron to the 6th Fleet on an extended tour which did not end until 6 October. On 22 October, Spiegel Grove was assigned to PhibRon 10, the new Fast Squadron. The years 1959 and 1960 saw the LSD participating in numerous operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean. Spiegel Grove stood out of Norfolk in April 1961 with Task Force 88 (TF 88) for \\"Solant Amity II\\", a good-will tour to the African coast. The force carried tons of medical supplies, food and disaster supplies, toys, books, and seed. During the four- month cruise, the ships visited Gambia, Durban, the Malagasy Republic, the Seychelles Islands, Zanzibar, Kenya, the Union of South Africa, Togo, and Gabon before returning home on 8 September. She then entered Horne Brothers Shipyard, Newport News, Virginia, for an overhaul that was not completed until early January 1962. USS Spiegel Grove in 1965 Spiegel Grove conducted refresher training and then spent March and April in amphibious exercises in the Caribbean. In May, she took part in operations supporting Malcolm Scott Carpenter's manned space flight in Mercury-Atlas 7. In July and August, she returned to the Caribbean for \\"Phibulex 2-62\\". On 1 December 1962 a tender availability period was begun to prepare the ship for \\"Solant Amity IV\\". The LSD loaded supplies during January 1963 and sailed, on 15 February for her second good-will tour which lasted until late May. The ship steamed over 21,000 miles (39,000 km) and visited nine countries before returning home. Spiegel Grove next deployed to the Caribbean from July to September with PhibRon 8. The landing ship has spent the greater part of her active service participating in amphibious exercises along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. Spiegel Grove was deployed to the 6th Fleet from January to June 1964, 3 November 1966 to 11 May 1967; and from 17 April to 9 October 1971. She participated in \\"Operation Steel Pike I\\" off Spain in October 1964 and made a midshipman cruise to England and Denmark in 1970. On 22 July 1974, she participated in the evacuation of American citizens from Cyprus along with several other ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet. She repeated this service in 1976, this time in Lebanon, during \\"Operation Fluid Drive\\". In 1983, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit participated in Eastern Wind in August 1987 in the area of Geesalay, Somalia.United States Marine Corps, Restoring Hope in Somalia with the Unified Task Force , 63. At sea, Spiegel Grove, , and took part as Amphibious Squadron 32/Commander Task Unit 76.8.2 from 2-9 August 1987. Post-commission career Spiegel Grove was decommissioned 2 October 1989 and her name struck from the Navy list on 13 December 1989. The vessel was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration in the James River \\"mothball\\" fleet. In 1998, title passed to the state of Florida, with the plan of sinking the hull to make an artificial reef off Key Largo. To achieve this, the EPA had to increase the acceptable amount of PCB (a toxic chemical substance) remaining in future wrecks from 2 ppm to 50 ppm. On 13 June 2001, Spiegel Grove was transferred to the State of Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, Largo, Fla., by the Maritime Administration, so that the ship could be sunk as an artificial reefing and to become a tourist attraction for divers. Sinking for reef Red tape and financial problems delayed the sinking of USS Spiegel Grove for several years, but the ship was finally moved from Virginia to Florida in May 2002. The total preparation and reefing cost was $1 million. The ship sank prematurely on 17 May 2002. During the planned sinking, volunteer work crews dropped her 12-ton anchors and flooded her ballast tanks with water. But the ex-Spiegel Grove settled too soon and suddenly started rolling to her starboard side, forcing workers to abandon ship - and their equipment. She sank several hours ahead of schedule, ending up upside-down on the sea bottom and leaving her bow protruding slightly out of the ocean and her stern resting on the ocean floor. On 10‚Äì11 June 2002, at an additional cost of 250,000 dollars, the ship was rolled onto her starboard side by Resolve Marine Group which pumped air into the port side hull tanks to displace at least 2,000 tons of water, used air bags with 350-400 tons of buoyancy, and two tugboats. On 26 June 2002 the wreck was finally opened to recreational divers. In the next week, over a thousand divers visited the site. There were 50,000 dives a year done on the ship during just the first two years. The ex-Spiegel Grove is located on Dixie Shoal, 6 miles (10 km) off the Florida Keys in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Her exact location is . For a scuba diver, this ship is long and wide; it is said that one can dive this wreck 100 times and still never see the entire thing. Her top deck is about below the water's surface. The vessel's hull, which is a labyrinth inside, is as much as under water, and silt can get kicked up and reduce visibility inside to almost zero, which can cause disorientation. The depth of the wreck requires that divers have an advanced diving certification. In July 2005, Hurricane Dennis shifted the former USS Spiegel Grove onto her keel, right-side-up, which was the position originally intended when she was sunk. Deaths In April 2003, Eunice Lasala, 48, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, died from a medical condition after surfacing, after diving Spiegel Grove. On 20 April 2005, Tarik Khair-el-din, 44 of Indiatlantic, Florida, made it to the surface after running out of air but drowned, after diving Spiegel Grove. In February 2006, David Hargis, 48, of Kansas City, Missouri, died from a medical problem after making it back to the surface in distress, after diving Spiegel Grove. On 16 March 2007, three divers (Kevin Coughlin, 51; Jonathan Walsweer, 38; and Scott Stanley, 55 ‚Äì all from New Jersey) died while attempting a penetration dive inside the remains of Spiegel Grove. On 17 October 2013, Captain Joseph Dragojevich, 43, of Lake County Emergency Medical Services, Florida, went missing in a penetration dive deep inside the wreck, and was found the following day by rescue teams in a room inside Spiegel Grove far from any possible exit. On 18 June 2015, Arne Berg, 65, of Dallas, Texas, surfaced after diving Spiegel Grove and became unresponsive. He was taken aboard a dive vessel, where crew members performed CPR. Berg was taken to shore at the Port Largo subdivision and transported to Mariners Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just before noon. On 24 April 2017, Robert Gaskins, 61, of Clinton, Michigan, became unresponsive on the wreck, then was brought back aboard the boat and then to shore at the Port Largo Homeowner's Park. Paramedics met the boat and transported him to Mariners Hospital in Tavernier, where he was pronounced dead. On 8 May 2017, James Ringold, 52, of Lawrenceville, GA, was on a trip with his wife when other divers located him around 10:15 a.m. in about of water, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office in the Keys. Ringold, who was aboard the commercial dive vessel Rainbow Reef, was unresponsive when he was found with his regulator out of his mouth in the vicinity of Spiegel Grove. Ringold was brought onto the boat, where CPR was performed as he was brought to shore, according to investigators. Paramedics met the vessel and took Ringold to Mariners Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 11:41 a.m. Gallery Image:Diver near an old gun mount, Spiegel Grove wreck, Key Largo, Florida.jpgDiver near an old gun mount Image:7777_aquaimages.jpgThe manoeuvering bridge File:Diver near on old gun mount, Spiegel Grove wreck, Key Largo, Florida.jpgDiver near an old gun mount Image:Spiegel Grove wreck, large reel on deck, Key Largo, Florida.jpgDiver photographing a large reel on deck Image:7846_aquaimages.jpgBow of USS Spiegel Grove File:US flag with diver on USS Spiegel Grove (LSD-32) wreck in 2007.jpgDiver posing near flag on deck References *  External links  * in the Naval Vessel Register * * navysite.de: USS Spiegel Grove * website of Spiegel Grove as a reef * The Sinking of the Spiegel Grove Category:Thomaston-class dock landing ships Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the Florida Keys Category:Ships sunk as dive sites Category:Ships built in Pascagoula, Mississippi Category:1955 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 2002 Category:Ships sunk as artificial reefs ","title":"USS Spiegel Grove (LSD-32)"},{"id":"1493083","text":"Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome (RTS), is a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe learning difficulties, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes. Other features of the disorder vary among affected individuals. These characteristics are caused by a mutation or deletion in the CREBBP and/or EP300 gene located on chromosome 16. People with this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and cancerous tumors, leukemia, and lymphoma. This condition is sometimes inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern and is uncommon. Many times it occurs as a de novo (not inherited) occurrence. It occurs in an estimated 1 in 125,000-300,000 births. Presentation Facial features (A), left hand and feet showing broad thumb and big toes (B, C) and X-ray of both hands showing short broad thumbs (D). (Limb Malformations & Skeletal Dysplasia) Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome presents itself from birth, and is usually hallmarked by delayed physical and cognitive growth. Typical features of the disorder include: * Broad thumbs and broad first toes and clinodactyly of the 5th finger * Mental disability * Small height, low bone growth, small head * Cryptorchidism in males * Unusual facies involving the eyes, nose, and palate * Anesthesia may be dangerous in these patients: \\"According to the medical literature, in some cases, individuals with Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome may have complications (e.g., respiratory distress and/or irregular heart beats [cardiac arrythmias]) associated with a certain muscle relaxant (succinylcholine) and certain anesthesia. Any situations requiring the administration of anesthesia or succinylcholine (e.g., surgical procedures) should be closely monitored by skilled professionals (Anesthesiologists).\\" Primary literature suggests the children may have a higher rate of cardiac physical and conduction abnormalities which may cause unexpected results with cardioactive medications. A further editorial reply in the British Journal of Anaesthesia discusses changes in the face and airway structure making it more difficult to secure the airway under anaesthesia, however, complications appeared in a minority of cases, and routine methods of airway control in the operating room appears to be successful. They recommended close individual evaluation of Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi patients for anaesthetic plans. A 2009 study found that children with RTS were more likely to be overweight and to have a short attention span, motor stereotypies, and poor coordination. The study hypothesized that the identified CREBBP gene impaired motor skills learning. Other research has shown a link with long-term memory (LTM) deficit. See also: Epigenetics in learning and memory. It is diagnosed when a heterozygous pathogenic variant of the CREBBP gene is identified in the individual. It exhibits an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, but some documented cases show heterozygous individuals exhibiting germline mosaicism. This condition affects men and women equally, and is often misdiagnosed with other diseases or disabilities that result in delayed mental development. Genetics Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome involving chromosomal segment 16p13.3 and is characterized by mutations in the CREBBP gene. Varying amounts of material is deleted from this section of the chromosome and accounts for the spectrum of physiological symptoms. The CREBBP gene makes a protein that helps control the activity of many other genes. The protein, called CREB-binding protein, plays an important role in regulating cell growth and division and is essential for normal fetal development. If one copy of the CREBBP gene is deleted or mutated, cells make only half of the normal amount of CREB binding protein. A reduction in the amount of this protein disrupts normal development before and after birth, leading to the signs and symptoms of Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome. Mutations in the EP300 gene are responsible for a small percentage of cases of Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome. These mutations result in the loss of one copy of the gene in each cell, which reduces the amount of p300 protein by half. Some mutations lead to the production of a very short, nonfunctional version of the p300 protein, while others prevent one copy of the gene from making any protein at all. Although researchers do not know how a reduction in the amount of p300 protein leads to the specific features of Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome, it is clear that the loss of one copy of the EP300 gene disrupts normal development. A mouse model has been identified in order to perform experimental research procedures. The model has exhibited the same clinical symptoms seen in humans and has become a foundation for future research. Unfortunately, in nearly 40% of cases, neither gene, CREBBP or EP300, can be implicated in the cause of the disease. In these cases, there is no mutation on the 16th chromosome leaving many more questions yet to be answered.  Treatment  There is no existing treatment that reverses or cures RTS. There are, however, ways to manage and reduce symptoms for patients. Patients with RTS suffer from a diverse breadth of symptoms. These include cognitive-developmental impairment, heart abnormalities, delayed bone growth, and skeletal abnormalities, auditory impairment, urinary tract abnormalities, including kidney problems, and dental and speech problems. Not every patient will suffer from all or multiple symptoms, and not every patient will experience the same symptoms, meaning they differ from patient to patient. Due to there being a wide range of symptoms, RTS patients are referred to specialists that focus on each specific symptom. There is not a specialist for RTS. For example, patients will go to an orthopedic surgeon and physical therapy for skeletal and growth abnormalities, like scoliosis but will go to a cardiologist if they suffer from heart abnormalities or a dentist if they suffer from dental abnormalities. Individuals suffering from cognitive developments usually are part of special education programs and speech therapy. The specialists the individuals go to match the symptoms the individuals have. Regular check-ups and monitoring are needed for cardiac, dental, auditory, and renal abnormalities. Genetic counseling is also recommended for affected individuals and their families.  History  Rubenstein Taybi Syndrome was first unofficially mentioned in a French orthopedic medical journal in 1957 by Greek physicians‚Äô doctors: Michail, Matsoukas, and Theodorou. The medical journal reported a case concerning a 7-year old boy with radically deviated/arched thumbs, long nose, muscular hypotonia, along with physical and mental underdevelopment. At this point in time the case study mentioned by the Greek physicians was considered to be an anomaly due to the fact that there hadn‚Äôt been any other reported cases of children with these specific physical and mental characteristics. The doctors accredited with discovering the syndrome and therefore bear its name-sake were unaware of this journal at the time of their discovery. However, it is acknowledged that the 1957 case reported in the French journal of orthopedic medicine is most likely the first reported case of RTS. Dr. Jack Herbert Rubinstein, an American pediatrician reported assessing a 3-year old girl with unusual facial and digital findings in 1958. Similarly, that same year Dr. Rubenstein had evaluated another child with similar characteristics, this time a 7-year old boy. Having sensed a striking similarity between these two unrelated cases Dr. Rubinstein tried distributing photos and information concerning these two cases to other clinics in the U.S. from 1959 to 1960. Dr. Jack Herbert Rubinstein graduated from Harvard Medical School and worked as the director of the Hamilton County Diagnostic Clinic for the Mentally Retarded. He has worked in behavioral and developmental pediatrics for many years prior to the discovery of this new syndrome. In 1961 Dr. Hooshang Taybi an Iranian-American pediatric radiologist reported having assessed a 3-year old boy that appeared to have the same syndrome as described by Dr. Rubenstein. During the summer of 1963 Dr. Taybi reported having evaluated seven children with characteristics such as broad thumbs and great toes, ‚Äúunusual‚Äù facial features, and intellectual disabilities ‚Äì these findings went on to appear in the American Journal of Diseases of Children documenting these characteristics as a syndrome. Dr. Hooshang Taybi graduated from Tehran University School of Medicine and worked for the Ministry of Health. Later in his career he taught and practiced pediatric radiology in Oklahoma and Indiana. He had identified three new syndromes with his colleagues, among them is Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome. In 1992 the first genetic abnormalities that act as markers for Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome were identified. These abnormalities are said to affect either chromosome 16 or chromosome 22. The specific chromosome impacted by a mutation determines the type of Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome that may occur. A mutation of the CREBP gene on chromosome 16 gives rise to the first form of RTS (most common). While a mutation of the EP300 gene on chromosome 22 is characteristic of the second form of RTS.

See page 24, article and photoMap of Christmas Island showing the location of Flying Fish Cove 'The Settlement'  Heritage  The settlement is listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List, citing the following aspects of significance: :The buildings that make up the residential precinct are of architectural significance, relatively intact and display considerable unity in a style derived from the British experience in Singapore/Malaya. This unity combines with consistent garden planting and ornamentation and the linear nexus of Gaze Road to create a strong streetscape. The presence of semi-detached servants' quarters are also of historic importance and are indicative of the social and economic stratification which prevailed on the island during the colonial period. The residential area is also historically significant as a reminder of the phase of Christmas Island history when the island came under the control of the British Phosphate Commission and the mining industry and the supporting community, underwent substantial expansion. The Services precinct is of social and historic significance. It includes a number of early Chinese terraced houses as well as a range of structures representing each of the various phases of phosphate mining, including one of the oldest structures on the Island. It was also the Island's main meeting place where Asian workers and European staff came together through a common reliance on retail, health, recreational and other services. The precinct contains a number of buildings of special significance to the community and, along with the three cemeteries, strongly reflects the mixed racial origins of the Island. The historic Malay Kampong precinct within the town, the Industrial and Administrative Group precinct overlooking the town and the Administrator's House 1.5 km east of the town are also listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

Early life Ord was born and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, the eighth of ten children. She grew up in a musical family; her father was a professor of music, her mother taught voice and piano, and the family toured and performed as the Ord Family Singers. Maren sang, learned piano from her mother, and taught herself guitar at age 14. At a 1998 audition for Lilith Fair, Ord met Canadian music impresario Terry McBride of the Vancouver-based record label and management company Nettwerk. She would be showcased at the music festival, and eventually take McBride as her manager. In 1999, after her sister told her about a talent contest from Edmonton contemporary hit radio radio station Power 92, Maren entered four songs she had written that night, and two of them‚Äî\\"Eternity\\" and \\"Falling Slowly\\"‚Äîwere recorded on the station's compilation CD, Power Picks Volume II. Career=The Nettwerk years and Waiting Once signed with McBride and Nettwerk, Ord continued to perform and record and embarked on years of progressive promotion, including use of her songs on several episodes of the American television series Felicity and her performance of \\"Shining Time\\" with Neil Donell to the 2000 motion picture Thomas and the Magic Railroad. Her debut album, Waiting, was produced by Stephen Hague and recorded in London, England and New York City. On November 7, 2000, Highway Records released a special edition of Waiting to a Christian, predominantly Mormon, bookstore market; this edition featured a bonus track that would not appear on the general public release. Nettwerk's record company released Waiting in Canada on February 20, 2001. While Ord was nominated for a Juno Award for Best New Artist, and her singles \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Perfect\\" were successful on Canadian radio, an anticipated U.S. and international release with Capitol/EMI in summer 2001 did not come through, and Nettwerk itself, not a major record label outside of Canada, released Waiting quietly in the United States on August 27, 2002. The single \\"Perfect\\" features on the soundtrack for the film Crazy/Beautiful. Not Today The EP Not Today was released on September 28, 2004, in Canada on the Maximum Music Group label in Canada. The EP included six songs mostly co-written with Randy Bachman. Pretty Things and the acoustic direction With the release of Pretty Things on November 21, 2006, Ord entered another phase of her career: an acoustic one. Pretty Things marked the beginning of Ord's production career as she co-produced the entire record herself at a studio in Orem, Utah. The sound is simpler, quieter and more reminiscent of Jack Johnson than Avril Lavigne (with whom she has been compared to previously). It saw a world-wide digital release through platforms like iTunes on October 10, 2006, and was met with mostly favourable reviews from her fans. Personal life Ord currently resides in Alberta, with her husband Joe and five children.

G. Becker & Co. was an investment bank based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Becker's history goes back to the 1880s when it was a commercial paper house. It evolved into a full line investment banking firm with offices in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, London (England) and Geneva (Switzerland), among others. Becker was a pioneer in the pension consulting business with the creation of \\"Green Book\\" tables comparing results to benchmarks, to help identify the performance of institutional investors. History=Founding and early history In 1893, Abraham G. Becker took control of Herbert Schaffner & Co., a commercial paper business in Chicago. The firm, which was founded by Becker's uncle had failed during the Panic of 1893. Becker, who had been a junior partner under Schaffner, paid in $50,000 from a life insurance policy to start his own firm and by 1904 Becker had paid back the losses suffered by Schaffner's customers. Initially, Becker paid needy customers, particularly widows, first out of his own pocket.The Jews of Chicago: from shtetl to suburb. University of Illinois Press, 1996 Abraham G. Becker, founder of A. G. Becker & Co. in 1893 Through the early part of the 20th century, Becker became one of the leading commercial paper firms in the U.S. Becker's commercial paper business had been founded on the dealing of \\"bankers acceptances\\", another form of short term finance for corporate borrowers, that was popular in the Chicago markets. At one point in the development of the commercial paper market in the United States, two banks were the dominant commercial paper dealers: A G Becker (concentrating its business in the MidWest and West and in the commodity markets) and Goldman Sachs (concentrating more on the East Coast and in the various financial markets of New York). The firm slowly branched out into a stock and bond brokerage. In 1911, the firm completed its first underwriting for Hart Schaffner & Marx. Thereafter, the firm raised debt for U.S. Gypsum and later issued preferred stock for Hupp Motor Works. By 1919, the firm had opened offices along the west coast in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle as well as in New York City and St. Louis. Also in 1919, Becker arranged a $50 million of notes for Sears, Roebuck & Co.. Julius Rosenwald, part-owner of Sears, had tapped his friend Becker to lead the offering. Joint venture with S.G. Warburg and Paribas (1974-1982) In 1974 A.G. Becker entered into a merger with Warburg Paribas, a newly formed American joint venture between London-based S.G. Warburg and Paris-based Paribas (Compagnie Financiere de Paris et des Pays-Bas, prior to the bank's nationalization in 1982).Manfred Pohl, Sabine Freitag. Handbook on the history of European banks. Edward Elgar Publishing, 1994 As a result of the transaction, the firm operated under the name A.G. Becker-Warburg Paribas Becker and was 40% owned by the two European merchant banks and 60% owned by the existing shareholders of Becker, a combination of employees and management.Becker Paribus: An Ill-Fated Union. New York Times, August 7, 1984 In 1982, the two European firms increased their stake from 40% to just over 50%, after they made a joint investment of $15 million to $20 million.\\"The Financial Times has examined the problems which caused S G Warburg, a Mercury Securities subsidiary, and Paribas to lift their joint stake in A G Becker- Warburg Paribas Becker to just over 50%.\\" Financial Times, July 13, 1982 The transaction, which had been championed by S.G. Warburg founder Siegmund Warburg and Becker's president Paul Judy, expanded Becker's capital base and added an international dimension to its investment banking business. At the time, the deal was considered emblematic of the globalization of finance. The joint venture was initially successful in elevating Becker's position in investment banking throughout the mid-1970s. However, the firm was plagued by competition between Warburg and Paribas, as well as cultural conflicts between French, English and American executives and internal management issues in the U.S. In 1978, Becker's president, Paul Judy, an architect of the joint venture was replaced by Ira Wender. Under Wender, a number of key executives who had built the firm either were forced out or left the company. Becker Paribas and the sale to Merrill Lynch (1982-1984) Becker's president Ira Wender was forced out of the firm in 1982 when the firm announced a major restatement of its financials revealing larger operating losses. He was replaced by Daniel J. Good and John G. Heimann.Becker Appoints New Leadership. New York Times, July 9, 1982, In July 1982, the two European partners increased their stake to just over 50% taking control of the business, in exchange for an equity injection needed to stabilize the company's finances. In October 1982, S.G. Warburg founder Siegmund Warburg, who had been the primary advocate for the Warburg investment in Becker, died. Although Warburg had originally planned to buy out Paribas, after Siegmund Warburg's death, Paribas bought out Warburg's interest in the joint venture in early 1983. Following the departure of Warburg from the joint venture, the firm was renamed A.G. Becker Paribas.French Partner To Buy British Share In Becker. New York Times, March 24, 1983, Kathryn Rudie Harrigan. Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy. Beard Books, 2003 Now effectively in control of the firm, Paribas, took a more visible role in managing Becker. In June 1983, Paribas' president Herve M. Pinet, became chairman and chief executive of Becker, and Daniel J. Good became President and Chief Operating Officer. Even though the profitability of other firms rebounded significantly in the bull market of late 1982 and 1983, Becker continued to sustain losses. In May 1984, Paribas bought out the 50% of the company owned by employees and other shareholders, taking full control of the business. However, within a few months, Paribas soured on the business after investing additional capital.Paribus Sets Funds for Becker. New York Times, May 4, 1984 Becker had lost in excess of $80 million, through the trading of government bonds, in the final months of Paribas' ownership, losing approximately $15 million each month. However, the company suffered more long-term challenges including high overhead costs and decreased revenues from its investment banking as well as equity and fixed income businesses. In May 1984, Becker sold its securities-correspondent business, representing 500 employees or one-third of its workforce, to Pershing LLC, which at the time was owned by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.A.G. Becker Cuts Staff 10%, Cites Weak Markets. Wall Street Journal, May 30, 1984 Then in August 1984, Paribas announced the sale of the remainder of the company, comprising its investment banking and other securities businesses to Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch acquired Becker for $100 million in stock but absorbed only a few hundred of the firm's employees.Behind Becker's Unhappy Breakup. New York Times, August 26, 1984 The acquisition of Becker came on the heels of the purchase of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb by Shearson/American Express and rumors during the summer of 1984 had paired Becker with Paine Webber, Morgan Stanley as well as Nomura. The purchase of Becker propelled Merrill Lynch to a leadership in the commercial paper markets and also enhanced certain of its investment banking advisory and underwriting businesses. After the acquisition of Becker, a number of executives remained with Merrill, most notably Barry S.

In 2018, Glanbia Plc. acquired SlimFast from Kainos Capital. Products=Original (1987‚Äì2004) SlimFast was originally just a diet shake product line. It consisted of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shakes meant to replace breakfast and lunch. The company suggested customers eat a low-calorie dinner. Usually, dieters would pick a low-calorie frozen dinner brand such as Lean Cuisine or Weight Watchers, as the SlimFast diet was a convenience product line that offered none of its own dinner products. Later, in the mid-1990s, SlimFast began offering meal bars that could be used as meal replacements. 2009 recall On December 3, 2009, SlimFast recalled all of its canned products due to possible bacterial contamination. The company stated that it had halted production until the cause was discovered. No further problems or issues have been noted. In 2011, SlimFast stopped producing cans and has since used plastic bottles.

The products are sold in more than 150 countries and are offered for both women, men, and babies. Dove's logo is a silhouette profile of the brand's namesake bird. Vincent Lamberti was granted the original patents related to the manufacturing of Dove in the 1950s, while he worked for the Lever brothers.  Product lines  Products include: antiperspirants/deodorants, body washes, beauty bars, lotions/moisturizers, hair care, or facial care products. Dove is primarily made from synthetic surfactants, vegetable oils (such as palm kernel) and salts of animal fats (tallow). In some countries, Dove is derived from tallow, and for this reason it is not considered vegan, unlike vegetable oil based soaps.

The campaign has been criticized as hypocritical in light of the highly sexualized images of women presented in the advertising of Axe, which, like Dove, is produced by Unilever.  Ad controversy  In May 2011, Dove prompted criticism and accusations of racism after publishing an advert for their body wash showing three women with different skin tones side by side in front of a \\"before and after\\" image of cracked and smooth skin, with a black woman below the \\"before\\" and a white woman below the \\"after\\". In October 2017, a three second video for Dove body lotion posted on their page on Facebook in the United States prompted criticism and accusations of racism. The video clip showed a black woman removing her T Shirt to reveal a white woman, who then lifts her own T Shirt to reveal an Asian woman. The full thirty second television advert version included seven women of different races and ages. The ad sparked criticism, leading Dove to remove the advert, saying it ‚Äúdeeply regret(ted) the offence it caused.‚Äù Dove further stated that the \\"video was intended to convey that Dove body wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity...\\" The black woman in the advert, Lola Ogunyemi, said the advert had been misinterpreted and defended Dove.Nicola Slawson: Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one The Guardian, 8 October 2017; Maggie Astor: Dove Drops Ad After It Draws Criticism for Being Racist The New York Times; Casey Quackenbush: Dove Apologizes After Body Wash Ad Is Slammed For Being Racist Time Magazine; Jeff Wicks: Dove extends olive branch over 'racist' ad The Times, 9 October 2017; Natasha Bach: Dove Removes 'Racist' Ad That Seemed to Suggest Black Women Were Dirty Fortune; Daniel Politi: Dove Apologizes for Ad That Shows Black Woman Turning Into a White Woman Slate, 8 October 2017; Whitney Kimball: What Was Dove's Thought Process on This Racial Transformation Ad Jezebel, 8 October 2017; Biba Kang: Dove‚Äôs apology for its Facebook advert is insulting to people of colour ‚Äì ‚Äòsorry you‚Äôre offended‚Äô really isn‚Äôt enough.

It often takes the form of a group of people attempting to focus the attention of a wider group on some cause or condition. Common issues include diseases (e.g. breast cancer, AIDS), conflicts (e.g. the Darfur genocide, global warming), movements (e.g. Greenpeace, PETA, Earth Hour), and political parties or politicians. Since informing the populace of a public concern is often regarded as the first step to changing how the institutions handle it, raising awareness is often the first activity in which any advocacy group engages. However, in practice, raising awareness is often combined with other activities, such as fundraising, membership drives, or advocacy, in order to harness and/or sustain the motivation of new supporters, which may be at its highest just after they have learned and digested the new information. The term awareness raising is used in the Yogyakarta Principles against discriminatory attitudesThe Yogyakarta Principles, Article 2, 9, 15 and LGBT stereotypes, as well as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to combat stereotypes, prejudices, and harmful practices toward people with disabilities.Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 8 \\"Awareness raising\\"  Terminology  Until the early-17th century, English- speakers used the word \\"consciousness\\" in the sense of \\"moral knowledge of right or wrong\\" - a concept today referred to as \\"conscience\\". Issues and methods=In feminism Consciousness raising groups were formed by New York Radical Women, an early Women's Liberation group in New York City, and quickly spread throughout the United States. In November 1967, a group including Shulamith Firestone, Anne Koedt, Kathie Sarachild (originally Kathie Amatniek), and Carol Hanisch began meeting in Koedt's apartment. Meetings often involved \\"going around the room and talking\\" about issues in their own lives. The phrase \\"consciousness raising\\" was coined to describe the process when Kathie Sarachild took up the phrase from Anne Forer: On Thanksgiving 1968, Kathie Sarachild presented A Program for Feminist Consciousness Raising, at the First National Women's Liberation Conference near Chicago, Illinois, in which she explained the principles behind consciousness-raising, and outlined a program for the process that the New York groups had developed over the past year. Groups founded by former members of New York Radical Women‚Äîin particular Redstockings, founded out of the breakup of the NYRW in 1969, and New York Radical Feminists‚Äîpromoted consciousness raising and distributed mimeographed sheets of suggesting topics for consciousness raising group meetings. New York Radical Feminists organized neighborhood-based c.r. groups in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, involving as many as four hundred women in c.r. groups at its peak.Brownmiller, p. 78 Over the next few years, small-group consciousness raising spread rapidly in cities and suburbs throughout the United States. By 1971, the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, which had already organized several consciousness raising groups in Chicago, described small consciousness raising groups as \\"the backbone of the Women's Liberation Movement\\". Susan Brownmiller, a member of the West Village would later write that small-group consciousness raising \\"was the movement's most successful form of female bonding, and the source of most of its creative thinking. Some of the small groups stayed together for more than a decade\\".Brownmiller, p. 79 \\"In 1973, probably the height of CR, 100,000 women in the United States belonged to CR groups.\\"Eller, Cynthia, Living in the Lap of the Goddess, op. cit., p. 43 & n. 8 (p. 43 n. 8 citing Shreve, Anita, Women Together, Women Alone, op. cit., pp. 5‚Äì6 & 9‚Äì14). Early mid-century feminists argued that women were isolated from each other, and as a result many problems in women's lives were misunderstood as \\"personal,\\" or as the results of conflicts between the personalities of individual men and women, rather than systematic forms of oppression. Raising consciousness meant helping oneself and helping others to become politically conscious. Consciousness raising groups aimed to get a better understanding of women's oppression by bringing women together to discuss and analyze their lives, without interference from the presence of men. While explaining the theory behind consciousness raising in a 1973 talk, Kathie Sarachild remarked that \\"From the beginning of consciousness-raising ... there has been no one method of raising consciousness. What really counts in consciousness-raising are not methods, but results. The only 'methods' of consciousness raising are essentially principles. They are the basic radical political principles of going to the original sources, both historic and personal, going to people‚Äîwomen themselves, and going to experience for theory and strategy\\".Feminist Revolution, p. 147‚Äì148 However, most consciousness raising groups did follow a similar pattern for meeting and discussion. Meetings would usually be held about once a week, with a small group of women, often in the living room of one of the members. Meetings were women-only, and usually involved going around the room for each woman to talk about a predetermined subject‚Äîfor example, \\"When you think about having a child, would you rather have a boy or a girl?\\"‚Äîspeaking from her own experience, with no formal leader for the discussion and few rules for directing or limiting discussion. (Some c.r. groups did implement rules designed to give every woman a chance to speak, to prevent interruptions, etc.) Speaking from personal experience was used as a basis for further discussion and analysis based on the first-hand knowledge that was shared. Some feminist advocates of consciousness raising argued that the process allowed women to analyze the conditions of their own lives, and to discover ways in which what had seemed like isolated, individual problems (such as needing an abortion, surviving rape, conflicts between husbands and wives over housework, etc.) actually reflected common conditions faced by all women. As Sarachild wrote in 1969, \\"We assume that our feelings are telling us something from which we can learn... that our feelings mean something worth analyzing... that our feelings are saying something political, something reflecting fear that something bad will happen to us or hope, desire, knowledge that something good will happen to us. ... In our groups, let's share our feelings and pool them. Let's let ourselves go and see where our feelings lead us. Our feelings will lead us to ideas and then to actions\\".Feminist Revolution, Appendix, p. 202. Ellen Willis wrote in 1984 that consciousness raising has often been \\"misunderstood and disparaged as a form of therapy\\", but that it was, in fact, in its time and context, \\"the primary method of understanding women's condition\\" and constituted \\"the movement's most successful organizing tool.\\" At the same time, she saw the lack of theory and emphasis on personal experience as concealing \\"prior political and philosophical assumptions\\".Willis, p. 121. However, some in the feminist movement criticised consciousness raising groups as \\"trivial\\" and apolitical.Eller, Cynthia, Living in the Lap of the Goddess: The Feminist Spirituality Movement in America (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 1995 ()), p. 188 & n. 3 (author, with doctorate in religion from Univ. of Southern Calif., taught at Yale Divinity School & Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.) (p. 188 n. 3 citing Shreve, Anita, Women Together, Women Alone: The Legacy of the Consciousness-Raising Movement (N.Y.: Fawcett Columbine, 1989), pp. 10‚Äì11).  Through poetry  Historically, Poetry has been utilized as a consciousness-raising tactic by consciousness-raising groups. Activist and writer Audre Lorde was noted to have been one of many scholars who wrote of poetry as a means of communication for women of color activist and resistance groups. This focus has also been studied by other feminist scholars as a new approach to women's literary writing experience, and the usage of critical consciousness through the creation of art as a liberatory praxis. Art as a liberatory praxis has also been explored through a radical queer lens through a number of publications and journals such as Sinister Wisdom and Conditions, online publications with an emphasis on lesbian writing. For LGBT rights In the 1960s, consciousness-raising caught on with gay liberation activists, who formed the first \\"coming-out groups\\" which helped participants come out of the closet among welcoming, tolerant individuals and share personal stories about coming out. The idea of coming out as a tool of consciousness-raising had been preceded by even earlier opinions from German theorists such as Magnus Hirschfeld, Iwan Bloch and Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, all of whom saw self- disclosure as a means of self-emancipation, the raising of consciousness among fellow un-closeted individuals and a means of raising awareness in the wider society. In atheism In The God Delusion, anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins uses the term \\"consciousness raising\\" for several other things, explicitly describing these as analogous to the feminist case. These include replacing references to children as Catholic, Muslim, etc. with references to children of the adults who are members of these religions (which he compares to our using non-sexist terminology) and Darwin as \\"raising our consciousness\\" in biology to the possibility of explaining complexity naturalistically and, in principle, raising our consciousness to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere (especially in physics). Earlier in the book, he uses the term (without explicitly referring to feminism) to refer to making people aware that leaving their parents' faith is an option.; See also * Awareness ribbon * * False consciousness * Internet activism * Legal awareness NotesReferencesBibliography * Brownmiller, Susan (1999).

An infrared search and track (IRST) system (sometimes known as infrared sighting and tracking) is a method for detecting and tracking objects which give off infrared radiation (see Infrared signature) such as jet aircraft and helicopters.Mahulikar, S.P., Sonawane, H.R., & Rao, G.A.: (2007) \\"Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles\\", Progress in Aerospace Sciences, v. 43(7-8), pp. 218-245. IRST is a generalized case of forward looking infrared (FLIR), i.e. from forward-looking to all- round situation awareness. Such systems are passive (thermographic camera), meaning they do not give out any radiation of their own, unlike radar. This gives them the advantage that they are difficult to detect. However, because the atmosphere attenuates infrared to some extent (although not as much as visible light) and because adverse weather can attenuate it also (again, not as badly as visible systems), the range compared to a radar is limited. Within range, angular resolution is better than radar due to the shorter wavelength.  Early systems  VMF(AW)-235 at Da Nang, in April 1966 showing the IRST in front of the canopy. The first use of an IRST system appears to be the F-101 Voodoo, F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. The F-106 had an early IRST mounting replaced in 1963 with a production retractable mount.Kinzey 1983, p. 12. The IRST was also incorporated into the Vought F-8 Crusader (F-8E variant) which allowed passive tracking of heat emissions and was similar to the later Texas Instruments AAA-4 installed on early F-4 Phantoms.Sweetman 1987, p. 552. AN/AAA-4 IRST under nose of F-4 Phantom The F-4 Phantom had a Texas Instruments AAA-4 infrared seekerSweetman 1987, p. 526. under the nose of early production aircraft F-4B's and F-4C's and not installed on later F-4-D's due to limited capabilities,Sweetman 1987, p. 532. but retained the bulge and indeed some F-4D's had the IRST receiver retrofitted in a modified form. The F-4E eliminated the AAA-4 IRST bulge and received an internal gun mount which took up the area under the nose.Sweetman 1987, p. 537. The F-4J which had a pulse-Doppler radar also eliminated the AAA-4 IRST receiver and bulge under the nose.Eden 2004, p. 279. The first use of IRST in an Eastern European country was the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mig-23.htm The MiG-23 used the (TP-23ML) IRST and later versions used the (26SH1) IRST.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/airdef/mig-23.htm The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25PD was also equipped with a small IRST under the nose.Peter G. Dancey(2015)Soviet Aircraft Industry,Fonthill Media The Swedish Saab J-35F2 Draken (1965) also used an IRST, a Hughes Aircraft Company N71.  Technology  These were fairly simple systems consisting of an infra-red sensor with a horizontally rotating shutter in front of it. The shutter was slaved to a display under the main interception radar display in the cockpit. Any IR light falling on the sensor would generate a \\"pip\\" on the display, in a fashion similar to the B-scopes used on early radars. The display was primarily intended to allow the radar operator to manually turn the radar to the approximate angle of the target, in an era when radar systems had to be \\"locked on\\" by hand. The system was considered to be of limited utility, and with the introduction of more automated radars they disappeared from fighter designs for some time.  Later systems  IRST systems re-appeared on more modern designs starting in the 1980s with the introduction of 2-D sensors, which cued both horizontal and vertical angle. Sensitivities were also greatly improved, leading to better resolution and range. In more recent years, new systems have entered the market. In 2015, Northrop Grumman introduced its OpenPod(TM) IRST pod, which uses a sensor by Leonardo.

MiG-29 nose showing radome and S-31E2 KOLS IRST With infrared homing or fire-and-forget missiles, the fighter may be able to fire upon the target without having to turn its radar sets on at all. Otherwise, the fighter can turn the radar on and achieve a lock immediately before firing if desired. The fighter could also close to within cannon range and engage that way. Whether or not they use their radar, the IRST system can still allow them to launch a surprise attack. An IRST system may also have a regular magnified optical sight slaved to it, to help the IRST-equipped aircraft identify the target at long range. As opposed to an ordinary forward looking infrared system, an IRST system will actually scan the space around the aircraft similarly to the way in which mechanically (or even electronically) steered radars work. The exception to the scanning technique is the F-35 JSF's DAS, which stares in all directions simultaneously, and automatically detects and declares aircraft and missiles in all directions, without a limit to the number of targets simultaneously tracked. When they find one or more potential targets they will alert the pilot(s) and display the location of each target relative to the aircraft on a screen, much like a radar. Again similarly to the way a radar works, the operator can tell the IRST to track a particular target of interest, once it has been identified, or scan in a particular direction if a target is believed to be there (for example, because of an advisory from AWACS or another aircraft). IRST systems can incorporate laser rangefinders in order to provide full fire-control solutions for cannon fire or launching missiles (Optronique secteur frontal). The combination of an atmospheric propagation model, the apparent surface of the target, and target motion analysis (TMA) IRST can calculate the range. The United States Air Force is currently seeking an IRST system for its F-15 aircraft.  Performance  Detection range varies with * clouds * altitude * air temperature * target's attitude * target's speed The higher the altitude, the less dense the atmosphere and the less infrared radiation it absorbs - especially at longer wavelengths. The effect of reduction in friction between air and aircraft does not compensate the better transmission of infrared radiation. Therefore, infrared detection ranges are longer at high altitudes. At high altitudes, temperatures range from ‚àí30 to ‚àí50 ¬∞C - which provide better contrast between aircraft temperature and background temperature. The Eurofighter Typhoon's PIRATE IRST can detect subsonic fighters from 50 km from front and 90 km from rear \\\\- the larger value being the consequence of directly observing the engine exhaust, with an even greater increase being possible if the target uses afterburners. The range at which a target can be sufficiently confidently identified to decide on weapon release is significantly inferior to the detection range - manufacturers have claimed it is about 65% of detection range.

He was initially known professionally as Jeffery Scott, but is best known as J. Scott Campbell. He rose to fame as an artist for Wildstorm Comics, though he has since done work for Marvel Comics (most notably as a cover artist on The Amazing Spider-Man), and the video game industry. Early life Jeffery Scott Campbell was born in East Tawas, Michigan, though he has no memories of that city, as his family moved when he was very young to the Denver, Colorado, which he regards as his home. He has a younger sister, who is a digital architect who fills out the orders for Campbell's e-commerce website, and a younger brother who is a musician.Chiu, Bobby (January 18, 2011). \\"J.

He first became interested in comics when, as a teenager, he visited a friend's house, where his friend showed him Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, which featured artwork by Arthur Adams,Wizard #41 (January 1995). pp 125 - 126. whose style would greatly influence Campbell's own.Cooke, Jon B. \\"The Art of Arthur Adams\\". Reprinted from Comic Book Artist #17, November 15, 2001 Campbell, explains, \\"I immediately went nuts over the book. That book had such detail. The art was fantastic. It just started me going. It just turned me around. All of a sudden I wanted to do this, and I felt I could.\\" Campbell began collecting, purchasing books based on the art, not the title, which he says made his collecting habits somewhat difficult at times. In 1989, Campbell, then age fifteen, entered for and won an \\"Invent the Ultimate Video Game\\" contest featured in the issue 6 of Nintendo's official magazine, Nintendo Power, whereby submitted contest entries were to consist of drawings and concepts for a video game. Color drawings from \\"Lockarm,\\" the videogame idea he pitched, were published in the magazine as the winning entry. Career=Wildstorm/DC Comics Campbell (left) was greatly influenced by Arthur Adams (right), seen here during an appearance at Campbell's booth at the 2017 New York Comic Con. After graduating from high school in Aurora, Colorado, Campbell began doing freelance commercial art jobs. As Campbell prepared to show his samples at the 1993 San Diego Comic Con, the series WildC.A.T.S premiered by Jim Lee's publishing studio, Wildstorm Productions (then called Homage Studios). One issue advertised a talent search for which readers could submit artwork, so Campbell put together a package that included a four-page WildC.A.T.S story and sent it in. A week and a half later, Jim Lee telephoned Campbell and asked him if he would move to San Diego to work for him. Initially working under the professional name Jeffery Scott, Campbell's first comics work was two pinups for the Homage Studios Swimsuit Special in 1993. His subsequent work for Wildstorm includes spot illustrations in WildC.A.T.S Sourcebook.Mariotte, Jeff; Choi, Brandon; Lee, Jim (w), Scott, Jeffery (p); Garner, Alex (i). WildC.A.T.S Sourcebook.

Campbell went on to co-create the teen superhero team Gen¬π¬≥, which debuted in Deathmate Black (September 1993), before going on to star in their own five-issue miniseries in January 1994. The series was initially co-written by Brandon Choi and Jim Lee, but Campbell became a co-writer with issue #3. The team was eventually given their own regular ongoing series, which debuted in March 1995. Campbell was co-writer on the series until issue #18, and was the regular artist, leaving the book after issue #20 (June 1997). In 1998, Campbell, together with fellow comics artists Joe Madureira and Humberto Ramos, founded the Cliffhanger imprint as part of Wildstorm Productions. He launched his comic series Danger Girl through this imprint. The story, which followed the adventures of a group of female secret agents, made the most of Campbell's talents drawing well-endowed women and dramatic action sequences. The Danger Girl series has since generated a video game for the Sony PlayStation, as well as several comic spinoffs in the forms of limited series and one-shots that were drawn by different artists in the American comics industry. Most of these spin-offs featured story outlines from Campbell himself. In August 2005, Campbell published Wildsiderz, which he co-created with his Danger Girl writing partner Andy Hartnell. In February 2006, the 200th issue of Nintendo Power included a poster featuring prominent Nintendo characters drawn by Campbell in his unique art style, along with an interview whereby Campbell recalled his memories of the \\"Invent the Ultimate Video Game\\" Contest. That same year, Campbell provided a variant incentive cover for Justice League of America (vol. 2) #0, the first issue of Brad Meltzer's run on the title. In 2007, Campbell illustrated the covers to the Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash six- issue limited series. Marvel Comics At the WizardWorld 2006 Comic Convention held in Los Angeles, Marvel Comics announced that Campbell signed an exclusive contract with the company, and to work on a Spider-Man series with writer Jeph Loeb. Between 2001 and 2013 Campbell did numerous covers for The Amazing Spider-Man, including issues 30 - 35 in 2001, 50 - 52 and 500 in 2003, and seven issues done sporadically from issues 601 in 2009 and 700 in 2013. His cover to issue #30 was used as the cover of the 2003 trade paperback that collected issues 30 and 31. In October 2016, Marvel Comics and New York- based retailer Midtown Comics jointly decided to pull from circulation Campbell's variant cover of the first issue of The Invincible Iron Man, produced exclusively for that store, after previews of the cover were criticized for sexualizing the depicted character, 15-year-old Riri Williams.Couto, Anthony (October 20, 2016). \\"Marvel Pulls J. Scott Campbell's Riri Williams Iron Man Cover\\". CBR.com.

Retrieved September 23, 2019. The cover depicted the character, a teenaged MIT engineering student who reverse engineered one of Iron Man's armored suits to wear herself, in a midriff-baring crop top, in contrast to the more modest way in which artist Stefano Caselli depicted the character in the book's interior art. Campbell called the decision \\"unfortunate,\\" explained that his rendition of the character was intended to depict \\"a sassy, coming-of-age young woman\\". He regarded the reaction to the cover as a \\"faux controversy\\", saying, \\"I gave her a sassy 'attitude'...'sexualizing' was not intended. This reaction is odd.\\" Brian Michael Bendis, the writer on the series, was pleased with the decision to pull the cover, saying that while he liked the face Campbell had drawn on Riri when he viewed the art as a work in progress, he disliked the completed art, saying, \\"Specialty covers are not in my purview and it was being produced separately from the work of the people involved in making the comic. Not to pass the buck but that‚Äôs the fact. If I had seen a sketch or something I would have voiced similar concerns. I am certain the next version will be amazing.\\" Technique and materials Campbell sketching Campbell does his pencil with a lead holder, and Sanford Turquoise H lead, which he uses for its softness and darkness, and for its ability to provide a \\"sketchy\\" feel, with a minimal amount of powdery lead smearing. He uses this lead because it strikes a balance between too hard, and therefore not dark enough on the page, and too soft, and therefore prone to smearing and crumbling. Campbell avoids its closest competitor because he finds it too waxy. Campbell has also used HB lead and F lead. He maintains sharpness of the lead with a Berol Turquoise sharpener, changing them every four to six months, which he finds is the duration of their grinding ability. Campbell uses a combination of Magic Rub erasers, eraser sticks, and since he began to ink his work digitally, a Sakura electric eraser. He often sharpens the eraser to a cornered edge in order to render fine detailed work. ReferencesExternal links  J. Scott Campbell on deviantART * J.

It was developed since 1990 and is free software released under the QPL license. Quirks  Because Tgif was developed long before a standard way for drawing programs to work, one might find it unfamiliar to use in a number of ways: *Although Tgif mention point sizes, it uses a unit that is 1/128 of an inch for point sizes. *While there is an option to display font sizes in points, the sizes are still subject to rounding to the nearest 1/128\\". *Unlike modern drawing programs, Tgif uses spline curves instead of B√©zier curves. *Also unlike modern drawing programs, Tgif does not allow the user to select a colour from a color wheel or through controls that allow the user to adjust colour values. Instead, Tgif provides a list with a short list of colours. If the user wishes to use a colour that is not in the list, they would need to add their desired colour to the list. This list is then saved with the currently-open drawing. *Usable fonts are listed in a configuration file. If the user wishes to use fonts that are not on the list, they would have to change the configuration file. *Only fonts in the ISO 8859-1 encoding (i.e. ‚Äúsquare‚Äù) CJK fonts and symbols or dingbat fonts can be used. *Rescaling can lead to ugly artifacts, which is most likely due to both the use of integer coordinates and roundoff errors. *Because Tgif uses Xlib (which predated modern Unicode support) Tgif does not and cannot support Unicode.  The Tgif file format  Tgif saves drawings in a Prolog-basedTgif FAQ - Tgif File Format, http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/faq/format.html plain text file format. Because the program is based on Prolog, there isn't a lot of support from other programs for reading the Tgif file format. Fonts are represented as PostScript font names. Originally, it was possible to print Tgif drawings in batch mode without using an X display. However, this feature changed somewhere in the 4.1 versions. Currently, in order to print drawings, the user would need to be running Tgif on an X display. This restriction cannot be applied if the drawing only uses Times Roman, Helvetica, Courier, and/or Symbol fonts.

In 1920, she married Sir Roderick Jones, Chairman of Reuters, but continued to use her maiden name for her writing. They lived at North End House, Rottingdean, near Brighton (previously the home of Sir Edward Burne-Jones), the garden of which inspired her play, The Chalk Garden. The Jones's London house from 1928 until 1969, seven years after Sir Roderick's death, was no 29 Hyde Park Gate, which meant that they were the neighbour for many of those years of Winston Churchill and Jacob Epstein.

Language-oriented programming was first described in detail in Martin Ward's 1994 paper Language Oriented Programming, published in Software - Concepts and Tools, Vol.15, No.4, pp 147-161, 1994. Concept The concept of language- oriented programming takes the approach to capture requirements in the user's terms, and then to try to create an implementation language as isomorphic as possible to the user's descriptions, so that the mapping between requirements and implementation is as direct as possible. A measure of the closeness of this isomorphism is the \\"redundancy\\" of the language, defined as the number of editing operations needed to implement a stand-alone change in requirements. It is not assumed a-priori what is the best language for implementing the new language. Rather, the developer can choose among options created by analysis of the information flows ‚Äî what information is acquired, what its structure is, when it is acquired, from whom, and what is done with it. Development The Racket (programming language) is designed to support language-oriented programming. Other language workbench tools such as JetBrains MPS, Kermeta, or Xtext provide the tools to design and implement DSLs and language-oriented programming See also * Grammar-oriented programming * Dialecting * Domain- specific language * Extensible programming * Intentional programming * Homoiconicity ReferencesExternal links * Language Oriented Programming: The Next Programming Paradigm Sergey Dmitriev's paper that further explored the topic. *Language Oriented Programming in MetaLisp Gyuri Lajos's thesis 1992 University of Leeds The system used the very same Top Down Parsing Language algorithm that powered Tree-Meta Category:Programming paradigms ","title":"Language-oriented programming"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(I,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/3.md","filePath":"glossary/3.md"}'),D={name:"glossary/3.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
