Ian Barry Brickell (26 October 1935 ‚Äì 23 January 2016) was a New Zealand potter, writer, conservationist and founder of Driving Creek Railway. Biography Born in New Plymouth in 1935, Brickell was the son of Shirley Margaret Wooler and Maurice Crawford Brickell. The family soon moved to Auckland, initially staying in Meadowbank then settling in Devonport on Auckland's north shore. While a student at Takapuna Grammar School, Brickell was introduced to potter Len Castle. He enrolled in a Bachelor of Science Degree at Auckland University College in 1954, completing his studies under the Post Primary Teacher's Bursary Scheme. His first and only teaching appointment was in 1961, at Coromandel District High School. This lasted only a few months. Brickell then became a full-time potter and purchased his first property near the township of Coromandel. In 1974, he purchased the adjacent 60-acre property, where his Driving Creek Railway and Potteries remain today. Brickell was one of the artists featured in Treasures of the Underworld, the New Zealand pavilion exhibition at Seville Expo '92. The exhibition toured to the Netherlands and throughout New Zealand before the works were accessioned for the collection of the National Art Gallery, now held by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He wrote several books and small publications, including A New Zealand Potters' Dictionary (1985) and Rails toward the Sky (2011). In 1996, Christine Leov-Lealand published the biography Barry Brickell: A Head of Steam. In 2013 Auckland University Press published the book His Own Steam: The Work of Barry Brickell to coincide with a major touring retrospective of his pottery work, organised by the Dowse Art Museum and featuring 100 of his pieces. Kiln-building Brickell was known for his skill at building kilns. Most of the kilns at Driving Creek Railway were designed and built by Brickell using bricks made on-site from clay sourced on the same property. According to Christine Leov-Lealand's biography, Brickell built his first brick kiln at age seven under the family home in Devonport, which was almost set alight. In 1968, he built a round coal-fired kiln for potter Yvonne Rust in Greymouth; in 1975, he built a kiln for artist Ralph Hotere in Port Chalmers, fired from pine bark recycled from a nearby wharf. In 1982, Brickell was invited to Vanuatu to build a kiln and establish a ceramics programme for young people, and in 1986, he built a wood-fired salt-glaze kiln for the Northern Arizona University Art Gallery. Honours and awards In 1974 Brickell was awarded a QEII Arts Council Grant to build New Zealand's first wood-fired stoneware pottery kiln, which he made with help from students, using bricks from a demolished hotel in the nearby town of Coromandel. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to pottery and ceramics, in the 1988 New Year Honours. Death Brickell died at Coromandel on 23 January 2016.

The station, which was established in 1922, was used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research cotton. Initial research at the station focused on growing long- staple cotton, which was used to make airplane wings at the time. By 1925, the researchers had determined that Acala cotton was the highest-quality variety of long-staple cotton; they then developed the \\"one variety\\" method of cotton production, in which every California cotton producer would grow Acala cotton. As a result of this research, the state of California enacted the California One Variety Cotton Act, which mandated that California cotton producers could grow only Acala cotton. The law spurred the growth of California's fledgling cotton industry, which now forms a major part of the state's agricultural economy. The success of the \\"one variety\\" policy caused the station to earn an international reputation for its research, and procedures developed at the station have been used in the Australian and Israeli cotton industries. The Shafter Research Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1997.

Early years Mathurin Guillem√© was born on 3 July 1859 in Sainte Marie-de-Redon, France. He was a deacon in his home Diocese of Rennes, then was admitted to the White Fathers (Society of Missionaries of Africa) on 22 September 1882. He was ordained a priest of the White Fathers on 22 September 1883. For six months he taught scripture at the novitiate. In March 1884 he left for Zanzibar, where he worked for fifteen months. On 19 September 1885 Guillem√© left Bagamoyo in the missionary caravan of Jean- Baptiste-Fr√©zal Charbonnier, headed by Bishop L√©on Livinhac, who was returning to his mission in Buganda. At Kondoa the missionaries met Captain √âmile Storms, who was returning to Europe after delivering the stations of Mpala and Karema to the White Fathers. The caravan reached Kipalapala on 12 December 1885, where it rested. On 19 January 1886 Charbonnier and his two companion left for Ujiji. There they embarked on Lake Tanganyika, reaching the mission at Kibanga on the west shore on 19 March 1886. Kibanga Kibanga was fortified so it could be defended against the forces of Tippu Tip and Rumaliza, who were constantly raiding the region for slaves. The mission provided a refuge for people fleeing from the slavers. The mission had an orphanage with over 100 children who had been redeemed at the great slave market in Ujiji. It was self-sufficient in food, with the refugees working the fields. Guillem√© was to work there for the next three years. Guillem√© assisted in obtaining supplies, building, teaching and supervising field work. In 1887 the mission was attacked by slavers who were driven off by gunfire, In 1888 the mission redeemed 162 slaves and baptized 204 people. At the end of that year there were three hundred children in the orphanage. Charbonnier died at Karema on 16 March 1888. L√©once Bridoux was asked to succeed him as Vicar Apostolic. On 16 January 1889 Guillem√© embarked for Ujiji to wait for Bridoux. Bridoux reach Ujiji on 25 January 1889, and the two priests reached Kibanga on 28 January 1889. At the end of April, Bridoux left for Mpala, taking with him Guillem√©, who was to head the mission there. Guillem√© became a qualified doctor. Around this time Guillem√© learned the art of vaccination, which he was to practice for the rest of his life. During a smallpox epidemic in 1908 he personally vaccinated over 1,500 people. Mpala The missionaries were reduced to three when Father Moncet died in August 1889. Guillem√© as Superior was assisted by Father Herrebaut, while Father Van der Straeten was assigned to the village of Captain L√©opold Louis Joubert near Mrumbi, to the south of Mpala. During 1890 and 1891 the intensity of slaving activity increased. Joubert, whose job was to defend the Marungu region surrounding Mpala, took an active role against the slavers. Rumaliza responded by sending an expedition with the goal of eliminating Joubert. On 4 June 1890 Guillem√© received a letter from Rumaliza warning that his troops were planning to cross the Lufuko River seeking Joubert, but saying they would not harm the missionaries. The next day however a storm destroyed many of the attackers' boats, and the others withdrew. Bridoux died of a fever on 20 October 1890. His successor was Adolphe Lechaptois, who made his base at Karema, which he reached on 8 September 1891. From there he visited the missions of Mpala, Mrumbi and Kibanga on the west shore. On 16 October 1891 Captain Alphonse Jacques, head of the Belgian anti-slavery expedition, arrived at Mpala in time to disrupt Rumaliza's plans for another expedition against Joubert. Jacques stayed until Christmas. He left the next day for the north, and established the military base of Albertville near the Lukugo River. By the end of 1891 the threat from the slavers had been seen off. The mission was prospering, and had 300 Christian households and almost 2,000 catechumens. On 22 February 1892 a caravan arrived at Mpala, led by Bishop Lechaptois. With him were Father Marqu√©s, who had been appointed pro-vicar of the Upper Congo, and two missionaries to reinforce the staff. Marqu√©s died on 11 August 1892, and Guillem√© administered the pro-vicariate until Father Victor Roelens arrived in March 1893. In January 1893 Rumaliza was finally defeated and forced to flee. In March 1895 the Upper Congo became an apostolic vicariate, led by Father Roelins. In December 1895 Roelins gave Guillem√© responsibility for the vicariate while he visited Belgium. In June 1896 there was a revolt of soldiers to the north of the mission, but Captain Joubert intervened successfully and the mission was not attacked. Roelins returned to Mpala on 10 September 1897. One of the tasks he set for Guillem√© was to exhume the bodies of missionaries who had been buried at Kibanga so they could be reburied in the church at Mpala. Guillem√© found that the fields around the former mission that had been cleared with so much effort had completely returned to jungle. On 25 November 1897 Guillem√© left Mpala. He crossed the lake to Karema, and then traveled by way of Lake Nyasa to the coast, from where he sailed to Marseilles. Later career Guillem√© was next assigned to assist Mgr. Joseph Dupont, the Vicar Apostolic of Nyassa, who had to return to Europe for medical attention. Guillem√© left Marseilles on 19 May 1899 and arrived at Kayambi on 29 July 1899. He founded in turn missions at Kilonga, Chiwamba, Mua and Kachebere. In January 1905 Guillem√© was appointed Visitor of the vicariates of Nyasa, Karema and Upper Congo, and was able to revisit the places where he had worked before in the Congo. Towards the end of 1905 Guillem√© was elected to attend the White Fathers general chapter. He left Europe again on 25 July 1906 as regional superior of the vicariates of Nayasa, Karema and Upper Congo. Bishop Dupont resigned for health reasons in 1911, and the Nyassa vicariate was divided into two. The new Apostolic Vicariate of Bangwelo covered the northern part of what is now Zambia, while the remainder of the Nyassa Vicariate covered northern and central Nyasaland (now Malawi). Father Etienne- Beno√Æt Larue was placed in charge of Bangwelo. On 24 February 1911 Guillem√© was appointed Titular Bishop of Mathara in Proconsulari and Vicar Apostolic of Nyassa. He made his base at Bembeke. He was ordained as bishop by Bishop Auguste-L√©opold Huys on 18 June 1911. In February 1915 there was a minor rebellion in which considerable material damage was done. Forty three rebels were captured and three sentenced to death. Guillem√© gave evidence at a subsequent commission of inquiry in which he pointed out that none of the rebels had been Catholics. He noted the dangers of distributing bibles too widely, since native teachers could make dangerous interpretations of the teachings in them. Guillem√© was always careful to avoid conflict with authority. After World War I he issued instructions to missionaries, Guillem√© returned to Europe again in 1920 to attend the general chapter of the society. After his return he founded a junior seminary, several new missions and a leprosarium, He introduced use of the local language into primary schools. In 1930 Guillem√© was honored as a pioneer of the Congo by King Albert I of Belgium. He later received honors from the governments of Britain and France and from the Pope. He retired on 27 June 1934, but continued to live at a mission in his former vicariate, which was given his name. Mathurin Guillem√© died on 7 April 1942 aged eighty-two.

Fort Pierce Branch at 101 Melody Lane  History  The residents of Fort Pierce created and began maintaining a reading room in 1903 to loan out books donated by churches and other civic organizations. In 1913, the Women's Club residence was built and the organization volunteered to house and manage the \\"reading room.\\" The St. Lucie County Library System began when the St. Lucie County Library Association was established in 1946 with a bequeath of the late P. P. Cobb, a prominent citizen of Fort Pierce. With only $1,000 from Cobb, the Library Association started working towards the building of a proper library. Under the supervision of the head of the Finance Committee, future Governor of Florida Dan McCarty, the association raised $15,000 by door-to-door petitions. Also, the city of Fort Pierce donated two lots located on Second Street and Atlantic Avenue, which were sold to the News Tribune for $8,250, raising the total amount in the treasury to $23,000. Using the money raised by the Library Association, on May 1, 1954, the Fort Pierce branch of the St. Lucie County Library System opened with its own librarian, the first county-supported library in the state of Florida. Its original collection was made up of 1,000 books from the old reading room and another 2,000 loaned from the State Library of Florida. More books and furniture were donated by surrounding churches, civic organizations, and local residents. In 1958, the St. Lucie County Library Association entered into a deal with the Okeechobee County Commission to form a regional library system. Each county had only one library and the one in Fort Pierce was designated as the headquarters. The St. Lucie- Okeechobee Regional Library System was dissolved in 1977 with each library's service obligation resorted to its own county, and the St. Lucie Library System was incorporated into the St. Lucie County government. During the 2004 hurricane season, the Fort Pierce library sustained damage from two broken windows due to gale-force winds which allowed water to get inside the building. On June 18, 2013, the Board approved the contract for sale and purchase of a building located at 2950 Rosser Boulevard, Port St. Lucie, Florida for the use of a future Southwest Library facility. The building, previously a City of Port St. Lucie Police Substation, will require major renovations in order to function as a County Library.http://stluciefl.iqm2.com/citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?MeetingID=2003&ID;=2296 Staffing and operating the library are expected to cost $571,000 when the facility opens in fiscal year 2015 or 2016.http://archive.tcpalm.com/news/shaping-our-future/new-library-branch-in- port-st-lucie-gets-nod-ep-379730680-332802931.html  Facilities  The St. Lucie County Library System presently consists of six branches that all together use 90,900 square feet of footage and in 2012, had a total patron visit count, both physically and virtually, of 813,915.

Nooksack Tower is part of the Mount Shuksan Massif and is northeast of the main summit of Shuksan. Nooksack Tower looms to the west over Nooksack Cirque. The East Nooksack Glacier lies to the southeast, West Nooksack Glacier to the east and Price Glacier is on the north flanks of the tower. Nooksack Tower is one of the most difficult mountains to climb in the Cascade Range, with loose rock, 50-degree or greater slopes and ice ridges as well as accessibility issues and exposure, all weighing into the climbing equation. The descent may require ten or more rappels. Climate Nooksack Tower is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.Nooksack Tower (left) and Shuksan's summit As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Background On April 22, 1994, Moorer defeated Evander Holyfield by decision to wrest the title, which Holyfield had regained from Riddick Bowe in his previous bout, from the two-time champion.There Is No Moorer Doubt: Undefeated challenger defeats Holyfield to win heavyweight title, L.A. Times article, 1994-04-23, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 Foreman, at 45, had been on the comeback trail for several years after choosing to end his ten-plus year retirement. He had received a shot at Holyfield's undisputed world championship in 1991 but was defeated on points, not by knockout or technical knockout. Foreman also had not fought since being defeated by Tommy Morrison for the then-fringe World Boxing Organization championship in June 1993. There were talks about Moorer possibly meeting WBC Heavyweight Champion Lennox Lewis in a match that would once again unify the three major heavyweight titles, but Moorer rejected the idea, stating that he didn't have the desire to do so.Moorer Rejects Idea of Unification , N.Y. Times article, 1994-04-27, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 Foreman then issued a challenge to the newly crowned champion, and his status as one of the most popular fighters in the sport along with the promise of a big payday led to Moorer ultimately accepting Foreman's challenge. The fight was scheduled for November 5, 1994. However, the fight almost did not take place. The WBA did not have Foreman ranked on its list of contenders and was thus not willing to sanction the bout. The IBF, which installed Foreman as its eighth-ranked contender, did offer sanctioning, but the WBA warned Moorer that regardless of what happened, he would be stripped of their championship if he went forward with the Foreman fight. Thus, his promoters at Main Events announced on August 10 that the fight was cancelled.Foreman-Moorer Bout Is Canceled , N.Y. Times article, 1994-08-11, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 Foreman and his promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank responded to the decision by filing a lawsuit in a Nevada state court on August 15. The suit alleged that the WBA colluded with others to discriminate against the 45-year old Foreman and to force Moorer and Main Events to honor the contract they had signed, with the demand that the champion not be allowed to step in the ring until they did. On August 20, the complainants won an injunction against the WBA. The presiding judge said the organization acted \\"capriciously\\" in not sanctioning the fight, and as long as he obtained medical clearance from Nevada doctors Foreman would be eligible to fight for the WBA title.Foreman Group Files Lawsuit , N.Y. Times article, 1994-08-16, Retrieved on 2013-05-29Judge Gives Foreman Green Light for Bout , N.Y. Times article, 1994-08-21, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 =Media= The fight was broadcast by HBO and aired as part of their long running series, HBO World Championship Boxing. Jim Lampley provided the blow-by-blow, with Larry Merchant as analyst and Harold Lederman as the unofficial ringside scorekeeper. At the time, Foreman was a second analyst alongside Merchant, but since he was participating in the fight Gil Clancy took his place. =Officials= Joe Cortez, a veteran of nearly 900 fights in his career, was the referee for the bout. He had already refereed five world championship fights in 1994 alone. The ringside judges were Chuck Giampa, Jerry Roth, and Duane Ford. The Fight Foreman said after the fight that he was out to lay his ghost from the Rumble in the Jungle to rest, referring to the legendary fight twenty years beforehand in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) where Muhammad Ali had overcome a previously undefeated Foreman and knocked him out in the eighth round (which remains Foreman's only loss by knockout) to win the heavyweight title that Foreman had held after defeating Joe Frazier in 1973 in Kingston, Jamaica by knocking him down six times in two rounds. Not only did Foreman wear the same red trunks that he had worn in Zaire, but in his corner was Ali's legendary trainer Angelo Dundee, who had been in Ali's corner for that fight. Foreman celebrating his new world championship at 45 years old, after beating Michael Moorer Moorer controlled the pace of the fight from the beginning and kept winning rounds. Foreman took a significant number of jabs to the face, which began to take a toll later in the fight as one of his eyes nearly swelled shut. In spite of the physical pounding Moorer was giving him, Foreman remained on his feet. As noted, he had only been stopped once in his career in the fight with Ali. In addition, only Ali, Jimmy Young and Ron Lyle had been able to knock him off his feet during the course of his career. Despite his ability to take whatever Moorer was throwing at him, Foreman appeared on the way to yet another defeat in a world championship fight. After the ninth round, judges Roth and Giampa had given seven rounds to Moorer and had him up 88-83. Judge Ford's scorecard was a little closer, as he scored the bout 86-85 in favor of the champion with Foreman winning two additional rounds on his card. Knowing where his fighter stood, Dundee told Foreman just before he sent him out for the tenth round that it was going to take a knockout to win and that the time to get it had come. Moorer was slowed down by a body shot early in the round, and Foreman's punches started landing more consistently. His planning, as Foreman said later, was to use the jab and the occasional hook to the body to force Moorer away from his tactics and leave him open so he could throw a combination with his jab and a right cross. By the midway point of the round, Foreman was starting to gain the upper hand and landed several effective combinations. A final right caught the champion flush on the jaw with such force that it broke Moorer's mouthpiece and cut his lip. A stunned Moorer fell to the canvas on his back and referee Joe Cortez administered the count. The dazed champion could not recover, only reaching his knees before Cortez reached ten. Foreman was champion again. Years later, when the fight was featured as part of HBO's Legendary Nights documentary series chronicling memorable fights broadcast by the network, Foreman said that his strategy was to let Moorer fight his usual fight while waiting for him to slip up. He felt that if he was able to wait, Moorer would leave himself open for a combination that would allow Foreman to knock him out. Foreman went further saying that was how he dreamed the situation would present itself. Moorer dismissed Foreman's recollection of the events, instead repeatedly saying he got \\"lucky\\". However, the fight broadcast suggests otherwise. Moorer was trained for the fight by Teddy Atlas and during the course of the fight, Atlas began to notice that Foreman was landing his best shots in close. Picking up on that, he repeatedly warned Moorer to keep his distance; Moorer's reluctance to do so ultimately resulted in his defeat. =Records= At 45 years and 360 days, Foreman beat Jersey Joe Walcott's old record by eight years, and he had also become the first man to regain a world boxing title twenty years after losing it - and on top of that, no heavyweight champion had beaten an opponent 19 years his junior to win a title. Boxing analysts and fans alike remarked on how Foreman had exorcised his old ghost in more ways than one - he had upset Moorer in a way similar to how Ali had stunned a younger Foreman in Zaire, using toughness, savvy and an ability to summon power at critical moments to overcome youth, speed and power. Aftermath After his victory, Foreman hoped for a potential superfight with Mike Tyson once Tyson was released from prison, however the WBA demanded that he face mandatory challenger Tony Tucker.Foreman Wants Tyson , Philadelphia Daily News article, 1995-02-15, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 Foreman did not want to be part of Don King shows and Tucker was a Don King boxer so Foreman refused to face Tucker, instead choosing to defend his remaining IBF title against German Axel Schulz, and was subsequently stripped by the WBA of their title.George Foreman Stripped of WBA Title , The Independent article, 1995-03-06, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 After narrowly and controversially defeating Shultz by majority decision, the IBF ordered a rematch between the two.

Times article, 1995-06-29, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 Foreman would continue to be recognized as the Lineal Heavyweight champion until losing to Shannon Briggs on November 22, 1997. After Foreman was stripped of the IBF title, Schulz met Francois Botha for the now-vacant title. Botha would win the match, but tested positive for steroids after the fight and was stripped of the title. This brought Moorer back into the title picture as he was chosen to face Schulz for the once again vacant title.Moorer and Schulz Set for Title Bout , N.Y. Times article, 1996-04-14, Retrieved on 2013-05-29 In a close match, Moorer was able to recapture the IBF title by split decision. This would set up a rematch between Moorer and the man he had previously defeated to win the titles, Evander Holyfield, who was once again the WBA Heavyweight champion after twice defeating Mike Tyson. With both men's titles on the line, Holyfield dominated the fight, knocking down Moorer five times en route to a victory via referee technical decision after referee Mitch Halpern stopped the fight following round 8. After the loss, Moorer would retire from boxing, eventually returning three years later. Foreman settled back into life as a preacher, author, pitchman and motivational speaker in Houston. Two years after his second and final retirement, Salton Inc. paid over $137 million to buy out the right to use his name on the George Foreman Grill, and it is estimated that he has made over $200 million related to the grill, which is more than he made in the ring.

The rear of the hotel was visible from the depot platform and used as a billboard to travelers, advertising its rate. The hotel operated on the European Plan, excluding meals from the room price. The hotel was not intended for luxury, instead catering to middle-income and business travelers. upright=1.3 In 1908, James Paulus purchased the hotel and renamed it the Hotel Paulus. \\"Hotel Paulus\\" was added to the west face of the hotel, the sign remains today. Beginning in the 1920s, the hotel was operated by Clarence Hamilton and known as the Hamilton Hotel. The hotel was vacant by the early 1940s. Furniture dealer and undertaker Herbert Lowe bought the building in July 1945; he converted the second floor into apartments and used the first floor to store furniture. The 2003‚Äì2004 Neillsville Architectural Survey identified the hotel as possibly eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The building was listed on the Register on March 20, 2013. , the Omaha Hotel is one of two historic hotels that survive in Neillsville. The owners of the building intend to rehabilitate the structure and turn it into residential and retail space. Design The building is located at the western edge of the town's commercial district, at the northeast corner of the intersection of 7th Street and Clay Street. It is a two-story, late Victorian rectangular building measuring with a one-story wing along the east wall. The exterior consists of red clay bricks manufactured locally and laid in running bond. The foundation is stone with a full basement. The south and west walls face the street and are topped with a bracketed metal cornice. The north and east faces of the building are utilitarian in appearance. The property includes one \\"non-contributing\\" garage built circa 1970. A non-original one-story aluminum addition extends from the north wall of the wing flush to the north face of the building.

John Calvin, theologian and Protestant Reformer. Depicts him holding the Scriptures (Geneva Bible) which he declared as necessary for human understanding of God's revelation. Calvin's general, explicit exposition of his view of Scripture is found mainly in his Institutes of the Christian Religion. The theology of John Calvin has been influential in both the development of the system of belief now known as Calvinism and in Protestant thought more generally. The Encyclopedia of Christianity suggests that: > His theological importance is tied to the attempted systematization of the > Christian doctrine. In the doctrine of predestination; in his simple, > eschatologically grounded distinction between an immanent and a transcendent > eternal work of salvation, resting on Christology and the sacraments; and in > his emphasis upon the work of the Holy Spirit in producing the obedience of > faith in the regenerate (the tertius usus legis, or so-called third use of > the law), he elaborated the orthodoxy that would have a lasting impact on > Reformed theology.Erwin Fahlbusch et al., The Encyclopedia of Christianity', > vol. 1 (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1999), 324 Publications Calvin developed his theology in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, but the most concise expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries.; The various editions of that work span nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death.; ; The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.; ; ; ; Themes=Scripture= Title page from the final edition of Calvin's magnum opus, Institutio Christiane Religionis, which summarises his theology. The first statement in the Institutes acknowledges its central theme. It states that the sum of human wisdom consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves.; ; Calvin argues that the knowledge of God is not inherent in humanity nor can it be discovered by observing this world. The only way to obtain it is to study scripture. Calvin writes, \\"For anyone to arrive at God the Creator he needs Scripture as his Guide and Teacher.\\" He does not try to prove the authority of scripture but rather describes it as autopiston or self-authenticating. He defends the trinitarian view of God and, in a strong polemical stand against the Catholic Church, argues that images of God lead to idolatry.; ; Calvin viewed Scripture as being both majestic and simple. According to Ford Lewis Battles, Calvin had discovered that \\"sublimity of style and sublimity of thought were not coterminous.\\"Battles, Ford Lewis. \\"God Was Accommodating Himself to Human Capacity,\\" in Donald McKim (ed.) Readings in Calvin's Theology (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1984), 38. =Providence= At the end of the first book of the Institutes, he offers his views on providence, writing, \\"By his Power God cherishes and guards the World which he made and by his Providence rules its individual Parts.; Humans are unable to fully comprehend why God performs any particular action, but whatever good or evil people may practise, their efforts always result in the execution of God's will and judgments.\\"; =Sin= The second book of the Institutes includes several essays on the original sin and the fall of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology.. According to Gerrish, Calvin put his defence against the charge of novelty in the preface of every edition of the Institutes. The original preface of the first edition was addressed to the King of France, Francis I. The defence expressed his opinion that patristic authority favoured the reformers and that allegation of the reformers deviating from the patristic consensus was a fiction. See also . In Calvin's view, sin began with the fall of Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil.; Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived during the time of the Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God. =Atonement= R. T. Kendall has argued that Calvin's view of the atonement differs from that of later Calvinists, especially the Puritans. Kendall interpreted Calvin as believing that Christ died for all people, but intercedes only for the elect. Kendall's thesis is now a minority view as a result of work by scholars such as Paul Helm, who argues that \\"both Calvin and the Puritans taught that Christ died for the elect and intercedes for the elect\\", Richard Muller, Mark Dever, and others. =Union with Christ= In the third book of the Institutes, Calvin describes how the spiritual union of Christ and humanity is achieved. He first defines faith as the firm and certain knowledge of God in Christ. The immediate effects of faith are repentance and the remission of sin. This is followed by spiritual regeneration, which returns the believer to the state of holiness before Adam's transgression. However, complete perfection is unattainable in this life, and the believer should expect a continual struggle against sin.; Several chapters are then devoted to the subject of justification by faith alone. He defined justification as \\"the acceptance by which God regards us as righteous whom he has received into grace.\\" In this definition, it is clear that it is God who initiates and carries through the action and that people play no role; God is completely sovereign in salvation.; According to Alister McGrath, Calvin provided a solution to the Reformation problem of how justification relates to sanctification. Calvin suggested that both came out of union with Christ. McGrath notes that while Martin Bucer suggested that justification causes (moral) regeneration, Calvin argued that \\"both justification and regeneration are the results of the believer's union with Christ through faith.\\"Alister E. McGrath, Reformation Thought: An Introduction (3rd ed; Oxford: Blackwell, 1999): 125. =Predestination= Near the end of the Institutes, Calvin describes and defends the doctrine of predestination, a doctrine advanced by Augustine in opposition to the teachings of Pelagius. Fellow theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, though Calvin's formulation of the doctrine went further than the tradition that went before him. The principle, in Calvin's words, is that \\"All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death.\\" The doctrine of predestination \\"does not stand at the beginning of the dogmatic system as it does in Zwingli or Beza\\", but, according to Fahlbusch, it \\"does tend to burst through the soteriological-Christological framework.\\"Fahlbusch et al, 329. In contrast to some other Protestant Reformers, Calvin taught double predestination. Chapter 21 of Book III of the Institutes is called \\"Of the eternal election, by which God has predestinated some to salvation, and others to destruction\\". =Ecclesiology and sacraments= The final book of the Institutes describes what he considers to be the true Church and its ministry, authority, and sacraments. He denied the papal claim to primacy and the accusation that the reformers were schismatic. For Calvin, the Church was defined as the body of believers who placed Christ at its head. By definition, there was only one \\"catholic\\" or \\"universal\\" Church. Hence, he argued that the reformers \\"had to leave them in order that we might come to Christ.\\"; The ministers of the Church are described from a passage from Ephesians, and they consisted of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and doctors. Calvin regarded the first three offices as temporary, limited in their existence to the time of the New Testament. The latter two offices were established in the church in Geneva. Although Calvin respected the work of the ecumenical councils, he considered them to be subject to God's Word found in scripture. He also believed that the civil and church authorities were separate and should not interfere with each other. Calvin defined a sacrament as an earthly sign associated with a promise from God. He accepted only two sacraments as valid under the new covenant: baptism and the Lord's Supper (in opposition to the Catholic acceptance of seven sacraments). He completely rejected the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the treatment of the Supper as a sacrifice. He also could not accept the Lutheran doctrine of sacramental union in which Christ was \\"in, with and under\\" the elements. His own view was close to Zwingli's symbolic view, but it was not identical. Rather than holding a purely symbolic view, Calvin noted that with the participation of the Holy Spirit, faith was nourished and strengthened by the sacrament. In his words, the eucharistic rite was \\"a secret too sublime for my mind to understand or words to express. I experience it rather than understand it.\\"; ; ; ; In common with other Protestant Reformers, Calvin believed that there were only two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper. Calvin also conceded that ordination could also be called a sacrament, but suggested that it was a \\"special rite for a certain function.\\"Institutes IV.xix.28. Calvin believed in infant baptism, and devoted a chapter in his Institutes to the subject. Calvin believed in a real spiritual presence of Christ at the Eucharist.Ralph Cunnington, \\"Calvin's Doctrine of the Lord's Supper: A blot upon his labors as a public instructor?\\" WTJ 73 (2011):217. For Calvin, union with Christ was at the heart of the Lord's Supper. According to Brian Gerrish, there are three different interpretations of the Lord's Supper within non-Lutheran Protestant theology: #Symbolic memorialism, found in Zwingli, which sees the elements merely as a sign pointing to a past event; #Symbolic parallelism, typified by Bullinger, which sees the sign as pointing to ‚Äúa happening that occurs simultaneously in the present‚Äù alongside the sign itself; and #Symbolic instrumentalism, Calvin's view, which holds that the Eucharist is ‚Äúa present happening that is actually brought about through the signs.‚ÄùB. A. Gerrish, \\"Sign and reality: The Lord's Supper in the reformed confessions\\" in The Old Protestantism and the New (Edinburgh: T &T; Clark 1982) pp. 118-30. Calvin's sacramental theology was criticized by later Reformed writers. Robert L. Dabney, for example, called it ‚Äúnot only incomprehensible but impossible.‚ÄùRobert L. Dabney, Lectures in Systematic Theology, p. 811. =Controversies= Joachim Westphal disagreed with Calvin's theology on the eucharist. Calvin's theology was not without controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant minister in Lausanne accused Calvin, as well as Viret and Farel, of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli.; In 1551 J√©r√¥me-Herm√®s Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character.; ; In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555.; In 1556 Justus Velsius, a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin during his visit to Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him on the issue of the treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles. =Calvin and the Jews= Scholars have debated Calvin's view of the Jews and Judaism. Some have argued that Calvin was the least anti-semitic among all the major reformers of his time, especially in comparison to Martin Luther.See Daniel J. Elazar, Covenant and Commonwealth: Europe from Christian Separation through the Protestant Reformation, Volume II of the Covenant Tradition in Politics (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1995) Others have argued that Calvin was firmly within the anti-semitic camp.; Scholars agree, however, that it is important to distinguish between Calvin's views toward the biblical Jews and his attitude toward contemporary Jews. In his theology, Calvin does not differentiate between God's covenant with Israel and the New Covenant. He stated, \\"all the children of the promise, reborn of God, who have obeyed the commands by faith working through love, have belonged to the New Covenant since the world began.\\" quoting from Calvin, Institutes II.11.10 Still he was a supersessionist and argued that the Jews are a rejected people who must embrace Jesus to re-enter the covenant.Pak, G. Sojin. John Calvin and the Jews: His Exegetical Legacy. Reformed Institute of Metropolitan Washington, 2009, p. 25. Most of Calvin's statements on the Jewry of his era were polemical. For example, Calvin once wrote, \\"I have had much conversation with many Jews: I have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or ingenuousness ‚Äì nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew.\\"Calvin's commentary of Daniel 2:44‚Äì45 translated by Myers, Thomas.Calvin's Commentaries. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1948, quoted in In this respect, he differed little from other Protestant and Catholic theologians of his day.; ; Among his extant writings, Calvin only dealt explicitly with issues of contemporary Jews and Judaism in one treatise, Response to Questions and Objections of a Certain Jew.Ad Questiones et Obiecta Iudaei cuisdam Responsio Ioannis Calvini in CR 37:653‚Äì74 and translated by R. Susan Frank in M. Sweetland Laver, Calvin, Jews, and Intra-Christian Polemics (PhD diss, Temple University, Philadelphia, 1987), pp. 220‚Äì61. In it, he argued that Jews misread their own scriptures because they miss the unity of the Old and New Testaments.

He advocated for equal rights. He spoke out against \\"bankers, millionaires, merchants, aristocratic mulattoes, [and] copperheaded Yankees\\". Bradley never divulged his age but speculation suggests he was born around 1815. He was born on a large plantation in South Carolina and was of mixed ethnicity. He escaped to Boston in the 1830s, became one of the first black lawyers in the U.S., and was among the very few African Americans admitted to the bar before the Civil War.University of Pittsburgh Law Review, Vol. 56, pp. 107, 108-109. Others include Robert Morris (lawyer) in Massachusetts, 1847; George Boyer VashonCatherine M.Hanchett, \\"George Boyer Vashon, 1824-1878: Black Educator, Poet, Fighter for Equal Rights, Part Two\\", The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, Vol. 68, No. 4 (October 1985). in New York, 1848; and John Mercer Langston in Ohio, 1854. A skilled attorney, Bradley also operated a shoe store in Augusta, Georgia, for a short time.Ella Gertrude Clanton Thomas, The Secret Eye: The Journal of Ella Gertrude Clanton Thomas, 1848-1889, University of North Carolina Press, 1990, p. 321. Early career In 1856 Bradley became the third African American admitted to the Massachusetts Bar.J. Clay Smith. Emancipation: The Making of The Black Lawyer, 1844-1944, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993, p. 191. He moved to Savannah, Georgia in 1865. In 1867 he applied for admission in United States District Court in Georgia. Northerners who moved south during the Reconstruction era were referred to pejoratively as carpetbaggers. Due to the anti-black socio-political culture of the time, as well as Bradley's confrontational activism against racial injustice, he was denied admission. Judge John Ersking cited that the basis for Bradley's rejection was that he was not grounded in the ‚Äúfirst principles‚Äù of law, and lacked ‚Äúmoral and mental qualifications.‚Äù Despite many efforts to gain admittance, Bradley was never allowed to legally practice law in this jurisdiction.J. Clay Smith (1993), p. 94. But he was defiant, and practiced law in Georgia without a license until 1875. He eventually moved to Beaufort, South Carolina, where he continued to practice law and serve his Georgia clients. Controversy and radical advocacy Soon after his arrival in Savannah, Georgia, in 1865, Bradley began to openly criticize the treatment of blacks during slavery, and demanded retroactive reparations to the year of enslavement. He was a vocal critic of social injustices, including police brutality, as reflected in this quote from a speech he gave at New Street Baptist Church in Savannah: \\"The reign of police clubs and police authority would be abolished,‚Äù and a blow would be struck ‚Äúwhich would stun even the policemen.\\" He also organized protests about General William Tecumseh Sherman's Special Field Orders No. 15. This ultimately resulted in the government bringing criminal sedition charges against him. Bradley fought against segregation with a petition in Federal Court requesting an injunction of operations against the Baltimore City Passenger Railway.Maryland Law Review, Vol. 63, pp. 721, 727-728. The railway company had a policy of forcing blacks to stand on an uncovered platform outside of the covered portion of the railway car. After the original petitioners withdrew their complaints, Bradley filed an amended petition against the railway company alleging ‚Äúthat the street car company refused to let him ride in violation of his privileges and immunities under Article IV, took private property without compensation, and maintained a common nuisance in violation of privileges granted from the government for use of its highways without regard to color or race.\\" Social initiatives Bradley was not afraid to challenge the status quo; \\"seeing himself as a champion of all blacks‚Äô causes, he cast his interests broadly, establishing loose contacts with black churches and soon opening a school. He began agitating for black suffrage, joining forces with the vote campaign.... He accused the city police and the mayor's court of discrimination toward blacks [and] charged the Savannah Freedmen's Bureau Court with similar irregularities and requested inauguration of appeal procedures, offering his services as judge....\\"J. Clay Smith (1993), p. 192.

The event commemorated the 57th anniversary of the completion of Arena M√©xico in 1958. Upon its completion Arena Mexico became CMLL's main venue and has served as the host of almost all major shows since then. Background The event featured six professional wrestling matches, in which some wrestlers are involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others are teamed up with no backstory. Wrestlers themselves portray either villains (referred to as \\"Rudos\\" in Mexico) or fan favorites (\\"tecnicos\\" in Mexico) as they compete in matches with pre-determined outcomes. The main event of the six-match show was for the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship between tecnico M√≠stico La Nueva Era and the rudo Averno. The Mexican National Welterweight Championship was vacated on March 20, 2013, when the then-Champion Tit√°n had to relinquish the title due to an injury. CMLL held a 10-man Torneo cibernetico, elimination match on the April 19, 2013, Super Viernes where the last two wrestlers in the match would face off on the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show to determine the new champion. The elimination match included Averno, Fuego, Guerrero Maya, Jr., M√≠stico La Nueva Era, Namajague, Rey Cometa, Tiger, Valiente, Volador Jr. and Sangre Azteca. Of the group Valiente and Sagre Azteca have held the Welterweight championship before. Of the ten competitors Sange Azteca and Valiente had both held the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. The Torneo Cibernetico saw Sangre Azteca eliminated as the first man by Fuego, followed by Guerrero Maya, Jr. (by Volador Jr.), Fuego (Tiger), Namajague (Disqualified for a low blow against Rey Cometa), Rey Cometa (by Averno), Tiger (by Valiente), Valiente (by Volador Jr.) and finally Volador Jr. was pinned by M√≠stico, leaving M√≠stico and Averno as the last two competitors. Averno had a long history with the character M√≠stico, that had left CMLL in 2011 and M√≠stico La Nueva Era was created to follow in his footsteps. Averno one of the finalists for the Mexican National Welterweight Championship The fifth match of the night was billed as Semifinal de Lujo (\\"The Luxury Semi-final\\"), a six-man tag team match between the trio of M√°scara Dorada, Rush and La Sombra and the team of √öltimo Guerrero, Volador Jr. and El Terrible. For this match CMLL brought together long running rivalries between La Sombra and Volador Jr. as well as Rush and El Terrible into one match. The addition of M√°scara Dorada and √öltimo Guerrero did not have any specific background at the time, with Guerrero focusing heavily on his conflict with Atlantis at the time. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in the weeks leading up to the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to set aside his differences with El Terrible as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After getting along and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. While La Sombra had travelled to Japan to participate in the 2010 Best of the Super Juniors (BOSJ) tournament Volador Jr. had begun showing rudo signs, but when La Sombra returned the two teamed up, seemingly without any problems. The duo lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to the Los Invasores team of Mr. √Åguila and H√©ctor Garza on July 23, 2010, again without any signs of dissention between the two. During a later show Volador Jr. finally turned rudo when he attacked La Sombra, tore his former partner's mask off and beat him up to start a feud between the two former partners. Over the years La Sombra and Volador Jr. have clashed repeatedly, in many match formats, many tournaments and for various championships such as La Sombra successfully defending the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship against former partner Volador Jr., in a match, which received rave reviews. On February 15, 2013, La Sombra defeated Volador Jr. to win the 2013 Reyes del Aire tournament. Following their clash over the Reyes del Aire trophy Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Negro Casas, La M√°scara and Averno and finally Shocker and Mr. Niebla to qualify for the finals of the tournament. On March 15, 2013, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On February 17, 2013, La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and M√≠stico La Nueva Era against Volador Jr. Euforia and √öltimo Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. The third match of the night, a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match between Rey Cometa and Japanese wrestler Namajague, was built upon a conflict that started during the previous year. The original conflict was between Namajague and his partner Okumua (collectively known as La Fiebre Amarilla) and the tecnico wrestler Stuka, Jr.. In late 2012 the two began facing off on opposite sides of Six-man tag team matches on various weekly Super Viernes shows, CMLL's main weekly show. In November Stuka, Jr. often teamed with Rey Cometa to take on the Japanese team and Puma King, initially as a continuation of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Puma King, who had unmasked Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show, but began to morph into focusing on the escalating issues between Stuka, Jr./Rey Cometa and Fiebre Amarilla. On the November 23 Super Viernes La Fiebre was on the opposite side of Rey Cometa once again and Namajague tried once again to win the match by illegal means, only to be caught by the referee and disqualified as a result of his actions. On the last Super Viernes of 2012 La Fiebre teamed up with Vangelis to defeat the team of Fuego, Rey Cometa and Stuka, Jr. Over the next couple of weeks Stuka, Jr. and Namajague found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches, teaming with a number of different partners which did not always include Rey Cometa or Okumura. Both Rey Cometa and Namajague took part in the 2013 CMLL Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") tournament on February 2 but due to their interaction and a mistimed move Namajague ended up landing wrong during a dive to the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, while moments later Rey Cometa also ended up hurt. Both accidents looked so bad that it put their participation in the follow week's Super Viernes in question, but in the end Rey Cometa teamed with Stuka, Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma to take on and defeat Namajague, Okumura and Misterioso, Jr.. Following the February 8 match Stuka, Jr. challenged Namajague to put his mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, an offer that Okumura \\"in his role as leader of Fiebre Amarilla\\" declined the challenge, wanting to face Stuka, Jr. himself. Rey Cometa responded to that challenge by issuing a team challenge, with himself and Stuka, Jr. against La Fiebre Amarilla for the team's mask and hair to be on the line. On Thursday February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference announcing, among other things, that the match between the two teams would officially take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas as the main event of the show. The match was won by Rey Cometa and Stuka, Jr. with Cometa securing the victory by pinning Namajague in the third and final fall. The storyline between Namajague and Rey Cometa did not end after the unmasking, instead it switched to an individual storyline between the two, that included Namajague breaking a pane of glass over Rey Cometa's head during a one-on-one match. The conflict led to CMLL signing a one-on-one Lucha de Apuestas between with Cometa and Namajague's hair on the line as part of the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show. Atlantis, one of the finalists of the 2013 Gran Alternativa tournament. CMLL announced that the finals of the 2013 Gran Alternativa tournament would be a part of the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show. The Gran Alternativa tournament is an annual CMLL tournament, started in 1994 with the 2013 tournament being the 22nd overall tournament. The tournament concept pairs a Novato or rookie up with an experienced wrestler for a tag team tournament. The rookie winner is often elevated up the ranks of CMLL as a result of winning the tournament, but there is no specific prize. The 2013 tournament saw 16 teams in total compete, with two blocks of 8 for the initial blocks that took place on the April 12 and April 19 Super Viernes shows and the finals on April 26. Qualifying block A took place on April 12 and saw the teams of Akuma (Novato) and Mephisto, Disturbio (Novato) and Volador Jr., Guerrero Negro, Jr. (Novato) and √öltimo Guerrero, Hombre Bala Jr. (Novato) and Atlantis, Oro, Jr. (Novato) and M√°scara Dorada, Robin (Novato) and M√°ximo, Stigma (Novato) and La M√°scara, and Taurus (Novato) and Averno compete for a place in the finals. The team of Hombre Bala Jr. and Atlantis defeated Akuma and Mephisto in the first round, followed by a victory over Taurus and Averno in the second round. In the semi-finals Atlantis faced long time adversary √öltimo Guerrero and his Novato partner Guerrero Negro, Jr. and was able to win the latest chapter in the long running storyline between the two wrestlers, earning Hombre Bala Jr. and himself a spot in the finals. Block B saw the participation of eight additional teams; Camale√≥n (Novato) and Brazo de Plata, El Cholo (Novato) and Rey Bucanero, Espanto, Jr. (Novato) and Mr. Niebla, Herodes, Jr. (Novato) and El Terrible, Leono (Novato) and Blue PantherSensei (Novato) and Rush, Soberano Jr. (Novato) and La Sombra, Boby Zavala (Novato) and Rey Escorpi√≥n. Zavala and Rey Escorpi√≥n defeated Leono and Blue Panther in the first round, Espanto, Jr. and Mr. Niebla in the quarter finals and finally Soberano Jr. and La Sombra to earn a spot in the finals of the 2013 tournament. The finals of the 2013 Gran Alternativa tournament was the only two out of three falls match in the tournament. In the second match of the night two-thirds of the Los Reyes de la Atlantida trio, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. was paired up with √Ångel de Oro to take on two-thirds of Los Hijos del Averno (Ephesto and Mephisto) and El Felino. Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. (along with Trit√≥n) had lost to El Felino and his two sons ( Puma and Tiger) in the opening match of the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, but beyond that there was no issues between the two sides. The opening match of the show would be yet another chapter in a long running rivalry between experienced tecnico Met√°lico and rudo El Hijo del Signo who portrays a brash, arrogant character out to prove that he is better than Met√°lico. The storyline began in late winter, 2013 as they began to face off in matches that saw Hijo del Signo cheat more than once to defeat the veteran Met√°lico. The storyline between the two was featured a number of shows throughout March and April, including a one-on-one match on CMLL's Super Viernes show, their main weekly show and an indicator that CMLL is escalating the storyline between the two. The two were on opposite sides of a match on the Arena Coliseo 70th Anniversary Show where El Hijo del Signo got disqualified for pulling Met√°lico's mask off during the match, a move that is prohibited under lucha libre rules. Each of the rivals were given two tag team partners for the match with no real reason or background given for Met√°lico to team up with Soberano Jr. and Sensei or for Hijo del Signo to team up with the Los Guerreros Tuareg team of Arkangel de la Muerte and Sk√°ndalo. Event Delta (in front) wrestled in the second match of the night. The focus of the first match of the show focused on the ongoing storyline between Met√°lico and El Hijo del Signo as they each led a team of three against each other. The rudo side of Hijo del Signo, Arkangel de la Muerte and Sk√°ndalo quickly won the first fall of the match. In the second fall Met√°lico, Sensei and Soberano Jr. came back to tie the match up between the two teams, forcing the match into a third and deciding victory. Hijo del Signo resorted to cheating to take the third and deciding fall for his side. The second match of the night was not simply about \\"rudo vs. tecnico\\" but also to some extent about \\"Youth vs. Experience\\" as the three young wrestlers √Ångel de Oro, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. took on the very very experienced rudo team of El Felino, Mephisto and Ephesto. In the end experience overcame youth as the veterans won the first fall as well as the third fall, finishing the match after Mephisto was able to execute a Devil's Wing move off the second rope on Delta to get the three count. The third match of the night was one of the focal points of the show, the finals of the 16 team Gran Alternativa tournament. Rey Escorpi√≥n showed that he had taken the young rudo Boby Zavala under his wing from the moment they entered the arena, Zavala wore a Rey Escorpi√≥n T-shirt and was give his own Los Revolucionarios del Terror (Escorpi√≥n's team) Sombrero with his name on the brim of it. The match focuses mainly on the two Novatos Hombre Bala Jr. and Zavala as they worked hard to show that they had the wrestling skills to work at a higher level than they were before the tournament. The match went the full three falls. In the closing moments of the match Rey Escorpi√≥n eliminated Hombre Bala Jr. after he used his signature Aguij√≥n Venenoso (\\"The Poisoned Stinger\\") finishing move, also known as a Package piledriver on Bala, Jr. Moments later Boby Zavala landed a splash off the ropes and pinned Atlantis to win the tournament. Following the match the rudo team were presented with trophies as a visual representation of their victory. Afterwards Escorpi√≥n touted the values of the Sonora wrestling school that he and Zavala both had trained at the beginning of their careers. Rey Cometa was accompanied by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450¬∞ splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting in the center of the ring. Volador Jr. and La Sombra, on opposite sides of the main event match. The match for the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship was originally planned to be the main event and last match of the night, but was moved down to the fifth match instead with no official explanation given. Averno had long time tag team partner Mephisto in his corner while M√≠stico was accompanied by La Sombra for the biggest match of his young career. M√≠stico started out strong, showing off his high flying moves to the delight of a large part of the crowd, but ultimately the experienced Averno took the first fall after catching M√≠stico off guard, pinning him following Averno's signature \\"Devil's Wings\\" move. In the second fall M√≠stico managed to trap Averno in an armbar submission hold, often referred to as La Mistica II, forcing the leader of Los Hijos del Averno to submit. The third fall saw M√≠stico control most of the match, displaying his wrestling skills and winning the approval of some of the crowd that had been hesitant to support the second M√≠stico up until that point. The crowd boo'ed M√≠stico when he applied La M√≠stica, the finishing move of the original M√≠stico to Averno. At that point in time Mephisto jumped in the ring to distract the referee and save Averno from being forced to submit. With the referee's back turned Averno landed a kick to M√≠stico's groin and then pinned him to win the match and the championship. With the victory he became the 71st Mexican National Welterweight Champion, a division described as one of the most important divisions in Mexico. CMLL usually tries to have their Friday night shows end by a certain time to give the fans enough time to use the public transportation in Mexico City before it shuts down for the night. Since some of the earlier matches had been longer than normal the sixth match of the night was the shortest match of the night. Volador Jr. came to the ring dressed like the Iron Patriot from the Iron Man 3 movie, continuing his tradition of wearing pop culture, especially super-hero, inspired ring gear. Rush, La Sombra and M√°scara Dorada quickly won the first fall, followed by Volador Jr. El Terrible and √öltimo Guerrero winning the second. Rush's actions in the third fall lead to one reporter stating that \\"Rush was a rudo trapped in the body of a tecnico\\", while he was on the side of the \\"good guys\\" in the match, he often used cheating tactics during the match. The third fall was cut short when Rush kicked El Terrible in the groin, drawing an immediate disqualification and a loss for his team.

He is depicted throughout his appearances as an anthropomorphic blue cat who accompanies the main protagonists on their adventures, often providing comic relief. In Fairy Tail, Happy is a six-year- old member of the magical Exceed race who possesses the ability to transform into a winged cat with white, feathered wings, and serves as a friend and partner of Natsu Dragneel. For Edens Zero, the character is re-envisioned as an alien android and companion of the female protagonist Rebecca Bluegarden, for whom he also functions as a convertible pair of blaster weapons. Happy has made appearances in various media related to Fairy Tail, including an anime adaptation, feature films, original video animations (OVAs), light novels, and video games. He is voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese media, while Tia Ballard voices him in the English anime dub. For the later Mashima series Edens Zero, Rie Kugimiya has been confirmed to be reprising her role as Happy for this version of the character in the Japanese media adaptions.J.C. Staff Produces Edens Zero TV Anime for April 2021 Debut -Anime News Network Creation and conception Following the completion of Rave Master, Hiro Mashima's initial idea for Happy was to create a \\"very chatty\\" mascot character that would contrast with Plue, Rave Masters mascot, whom he had difficulty with writing as Plue did not speak. In the pre-production stage of Fairy Tail, Mashima drew an illustration depicting two cat-like creatures resembling Happy with bird- like feet and feathered wings for arms. Mashima initially named the character after the Norse god Freyr, which he felt was \\"too much\\" for the character and changed to something \\"more suitable\\". When asked about the creation of his characters, Mashima replied that each character embodies a part of his own personality, with Happy representing how he acts when slacking off, later stating that Happy was based on his fondness of cats. Upon the introduction of Carla, Happy's female counterpart, Mashima's original concept for Happy underwent \\"a huge change\\", which inspired the author to write a character arc for him shortly afterward. Mashima also mentioned that Natsu and Happy's midair battle against Cobra was \\"something [he] always wanted to do\\", commenting that it was the first time Happy had been directly involved in one of the series' battle scenes. Regarding the anime adaptation of Fairy Tail, Mashima commented that he enjoyed seeing Natsu and Happy \\"move around\\", stating, \\"There's a limit to the effects I can draw regarding the depiction of the magic in the manga, so seeing that in the anime is so much fun, and it looks very beautiful onscreen. It made me realize how fun my characters are when I saw them moving around.\\" He considers Happy to have the best portrayal in the anime out of all the manga's characters. Yohei Ito, the producer of the film Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry, described Happy as both \\"funny\\" and \\"really useful\\", as he \\"works in cute scenes and serious scenes.\\" Happy is voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese media, and by Tia Ballard in the English dub. While developing Edens Zero, Mashima decided to reuse Happy as a stand-in for the series' primary mascot character, E.M. Pino, whom he struggled to include in the first chapter; before settling on Happy, Mashima drew various concepts of different animal characters, which he described as a futile attempt as he felt the character was bound to become Happy. This iteration of the character has a black-tipped tail as opposed to a white-tipped one in Fairy Tail, and wears a collar with a heart-marked \\"B-Cube\\" instead of a green satchel. Appearances=In Fairy Tail= Fairy Tail depicts Happy as a sardonic member of the titular wizards' guild, and as a companion of the \\"dragon slayer\\" wizard Natsu Dragneel, with their partnership eventually expanding to include the newcomer Lucy Heartfilia and two childhood friends, Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet. He is a feline creature called an Exceed that exhibits a natural ability to fly by producing white, feathered wings on his back with a spell called while his friendship with Natsu enables Happy to carry him without triggering the latter's motion sickness. In his backstory, most of which is presented in an omake chapter, Happy is laid as an egg by the Exceed couple Lucky and Marl, which is discovered and hatched by Natsu six years before the series' narrative begins; his birth immediately quells an argument the rest of the guild have over the egg, which inspires Natsu to give Happy his name as a symbolic bluebird of happiness. Later in the series, Happy encounters a female Exceed named Carla, who reveals that she and Happy originate from Edolas, a parallel world to the series' primary setting of Earth-land where Exceed are revered as divine beings for their innate magical power, which the other inhabitants of Edolas lack. Happy is initially shocked to discover that he, Carla, and 98 other unborn Exceed were transported to Earth-land by their kind with the directive of killing dragon slayers such as Natsu; however, the two later learn that the \\"mission\\" is actually a cover-up for an evacuation effort arranged by the precognitive Exceed queen Chagot following her prediction of their kingdom's destruction, with the pretense of hunting dragon slayers derived from her visions of future events. Happy continues to support Natsu and the guild for the duration of the series, which eventually results in Happy helping Natsu become human upon the discovery that he is an Etherious demon created by the dark wizard Zeref, and later assisting Fairy Tail and their allies' efforts to trap and eventually kill the evil dragon Acnologia within the defensive spell Fairy Sphere. By the end of Fairy Tail, Happy accompanies his team on a \\"century quest\\", a guild mission that has never been accomplished in less than 100 years. =In Edens Zero= Within the setting of Edens Zero, Happy is a feline alien from a planet named He is the lifelong friend and partner the series' female protagonist, Rebecca Bluegarden, who gives him his name upon finding him as an orphan. After Happy is run over by a drunk driver during Rebecca's childhood, the machinist Professor Weisz Steiner revives him by transferring his consciousness into an advanced android body. Happy's robotic features allow him to reconfigure himself into a pair of rayguns that Rebecca wields in battle called which fire rounds of non-lethal \\"Ether\\" bullets to incapacitate targets. Together, he and Rebecca manage an account called \\"Aoneko Channel\\" on the online video platform B-Cube, with the pair's goal being to obtain one million subscribers by uploading videos of different planets they visit as members of Shooting Starlight, an adventurers' guild. Shortly into the series, Happy and Rebecca join the crew of the titular warship Edens Zero, captained by male protagonist Shiki Granbell, to search for the cosmic goddess Mother as a way to achieve their goal. =In other media= In addition to the manga and its anime adaptation, Happy makes appearances in various other media related to Fairy Tail. In the 2012 film Fairy Tail the Movie: Phoenix Priestess, Happy joins his team in helping a priestess called √âclair reach her destination; he also makes an appearance in the one-shot prologue manga created by Hiro Mashima for the film, as well as its animated adaptation. In the 2017 film Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry, Happy and other Fairy Tail members are assigned by the king of Fiore to recover the stolen Dragon Cry staff from another kingdom; Happy's fur also turns red for a portion of the film as a side effect of eating one of the local fruit, which persists until he finally breathes fire. Happy is also a character in all nine Fairy Tail original video animations (OVAs). In the first OVA, he gives a tour of the guild's all-female dormitory to Wendy Marvell and Carla; in the second, he is depicted as an academy professor; in the third, he is sent six years into the past by a magic book; in the fourth, Happy goes to a camp to support his friends' training for the Grand Magic Games; in the fifth, he spends time at a water park; the sixth is a crossover OVA of Fairy Tail and Hiro Mashima's Rave Master series, where Happy meets Rave Master protagonists Haru Glory and Elie; in the seventh, Happy participates in a penalty game; in the eighth, he tries to cheer Mavis Vermillion up by finding one of her missing belongings; and in the ninth, Happy attends a Christmas party held at Lucy's house. He also appears in every light novel based on the series, including one set in the Edo period, as well as one which is inspired by the Alice in Wonderland novel. Happy makes a minor appearance in the Fairy Tail spin-off manga Blue Mistral, which focuses on the characters Wendy and Carla in their early membership of the guild. He also features as the main protagonist of the manga Fairy Tail: Happy Adventure, written and illustrated by Kenshir≈ç Sakamoto. Happy is a playable character in several Fairy Tail video games, such as the 2010 PlayStation Portable action video game Fairy Tail: Portable Guild developed by Konami, and its two sequels: Fairy Tail: Portable Guild 2, released in 2011, and Fairy Tail: Zeref Awakens, released in 2012. Reception Happy has received positive comments from critics reviewing the Fairy Tail manga and its related media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network (ANN) described Happy as \\"a misbegotten offspring of an alley cat and a bobblehead\\" in his review of the first manga volume, and called him \\"an excellent stooge\\" in the second volume. Dale North of Japanator praised the character's humor, commenting, \\"Happy's background gags will have you giggling chapter after chapter.\\" For the anime adaptation, Carlo Santos of ANN called Happy \\"an entertaining diversion\\", praising his role as an animal sidekick that is \\"fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance\\". The reviewer found the story of Happy's birth in the anime to be \\"entertaining\\", but commented that it \\"could have been inserted anywhere in the series\\". Kimlinger praised Happy's role alongside Carla in the Edolas story arc, in which their status as Natsu and Wendy Marvell's respective sidekicks is deconstructed, with the reviewer calling them \\"the arc's emotional lynchpin\\". While Kimlinger wrote that while Happy's partnership with Natsu and Lucy was bizarre, he felt that their \\"oddball teamwork\\" represented the core part of the series' ensemble. Rebecca Silverman of ANN praised Happy's moments of heroism and being underestimated by the series' villains, saying, \\"For a character who usually plays the comic relief, this is a good change and a nice way to make him more relevant as a character than just being Natsu's transportation.\\" In a review of the film Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry, Robert Prentice of Three If by Space considered the portion where Happy's fur turns red to be a \\"funny little side note\\". =Popularity and merchandise= In a Fairy Tail popularity poll published in the 26th issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, Happy ranked fourth with a total of 4238 votes. Merchandise based on Happy has been released, including a pin and caf√© memo set.

Amount of Child support There are 3 methods for calculating the level of child support a liable parent, and they are: 1\\\\. Order of the Family Court 2\\\\. Voluntary agreement 3\\\\. Inland Revenue calculation =Order of the Family Court= Subject to certain limitations, the IRD can enforce a child support order made by the Family Court. = Voluntary agreement= Subject to certain limitations, both parents can agree to a voluntary agreement, and register the agreement with the IRD for enforcement. = Inland Revenue Calculation= By far, the most common, and most contentious method, is the IRD making a calculation for the amount of child support that a liable parent is required to pay in child support. The calculation takes into account the liable parent‚Äôs income for the previous year, their current living arrangements, and how many children the custodial parent has, although there are many departures to these rules. Calculation of Liable Parents Income The annual income used for child support, is generally the income from the previous tax year, i.e. the year to 31 March, although the IRD make in February an estimate of the first 6 months due to the fact that tax returns are not later filed until July, and these estimates are later readjusted in August after the tax return has been filed. However, under certain circumstances the Liable Parent can use an estimate of their income for the year. Furthermore, self-employed people can use their taxable income from not the previous tax year, but the tax year before. Calculation of Liable Parents Living Allowance The IRD gives the Liable Parent a living allowance, for which no child support is payable and it varies depending on whether the Liable Parent has a spouse or dependent children. However, if the liable parent has higher living expenses than normal, then they can apply for an Administrative Review to increase their living allowance. =IRD Living allowances from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014= Single person with no dependents - $14,960.00 Married or with a civil union or de facto partner and with no dependent children - $20,343.00 Single, married or with a civil union or de facto partner, with one child living with the paying parent - $28,734.00 Single, married or with a civil union or de facto partner, with two children living with the paying parent - $31,743.00 Single, married or with a civil union or de facto partner, with three children living with the paying parent - $34,753.00 Single, married or with a civil union or de facto partner, with four or more children living with the paying parent - $37,762.00 Calculating the Child Support income percentage The percentage rate the IRD use depends on the number of children for whom the paying parent must pay child support. The list below shows the percentages where the paying parent is not in a shared care arrangement for child support purposes: * one child 18% * two children 24% * three children 27% * four or more children 30%. Example For example, a Liable Parent, living alone with no dependent children, earning $40,000, with 2 children with the custodial parent would pay the following in child support: $40,000 (gross income) minus $14,960 (living allowance) equals $25,040 $25,040 then multiplied by 24% (for 2 children) = annual child support of $6,009.60 which then divided by 12 =$500.80 per month in child support. Minimum Child support There is a minimum amount of child support to pay, unless the liable parent is exempt, which is currently $16.80 per week. As this amount has remained unchanged in 20 years, the proposed Child Support Amendment Bill is speculated to increase this amount to $35 per week, which will also be adjusted annually for inflation. Liable Parents exempt from Child Support Amongst the very few exemptions for Liable Parents to pay child support are long term hospital patients and prison inmates, of 13 weeks or more, as well as Liable Parents while they are aged 16 years or younger, are exempt from paying child support. Administrative Review Either parent can apply for a reassessment for a different amount in child support, which is referred to as an Administrative Review. An administrative review is based on the Family Court departure order process. Child Support staff organise the review process, but the actual review is done by an independent person, called the review officer, who is contracted to Inland Revenue. In deciding whether to change an assessment, the review officer must consider: * the special circumstances * whether a change would be fair to both parties and the children * if a change would be otherwise appropriate. When you apply for an administrative review, you will be asked to provide details of your financial situation. If the other parent wants to take part in the review: * they are allowed to have a copy of your application and any supporting information, including the financial details * you are allowed to have a copy of their response and supporting information. This swapping of information is done: * so both people know all the information the review officer will be considering, and * so each can respond to the other's details. Grounds for an Administrative Review There are 11 grounds for an Administrative Review, which are as follows: *You have a duty to maintain another child or person. *It costs extra to cover the special needs of another child or person you have a duty to maintain. *You have necessary expenses in supporting yourself. *You have necessary expenses in supporting another child or person you have a duty to maintain. *It costs more than 5% of the child support income amount to enable the paying parent to have contact with the child. *It costs you extra to cover the child's special needs. *It costs you extra to care for, educate or train the child in the way that was expected by either parent. *The child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of either parent or the child. *You are the paying parent and the assessment does not take into account that you have previously made payments, transfers or property settlements for the benefit of the child. *You are the paying parent and you still have a financial interest in a property that the custodian is entitled to live in. So for instance if the Liable Parent had the high cost of paying $100 per week for a car loan, they would generally be denied a reassessment of their living expenses. However, if the Liable Parent applied for a reassessment for the car loan as the car was required to get to work, it is likely to be accepted. * where one person may incur significant costs in re-establishing themselves  Child Support Arrears If the Liable parent gets in arrears in their child support payments, the IRD will make the Liable parents employer deduct the arrears from their pay, up to the maximum of 40% of their pay, as the rest is referred to as Protected Earnings. Other powers the IRD have is to deduct money from the Liable parent‚Äôs bank account, as well as transfer any tax refund that they may be normally entitled to. Unlike some countries, the New Zealand child support regime has no penalty of imprisonment for arrears. However it is arguable that the IRD has the power to arrest a Liable Parent in arrears at the airport, but as this is so problematic with complying with the law, it is never done. Not that this stops the IRD from threatening to do so. Penalties Like other overdue tax penalties, the IRD has a harsh penalty regime of adding 2% immediately when it falls due, with another 8% added 7 days later if it still not paid. Thereafter, a penalty of 2% is charged every month for the first 12 months, then reducing to 1% per month thereafter. This has resulted in a self- perpetuating cycle of the IRD largely chasing up arrears that are just penalties. For instance, as at 31 March 2012, of a combined total IRD child support debt arrears of $2,305 million, 72% of this was the $1,668 million worth of unpaid penalties. The IRD now has greater flexibility in waiving such penalties, especially where the Liable parent enters into a repayment plan to pay off the arrears. Interestingly enough, the Child Support Penalties are not forwarded on to the Custodial parent, but are instead retained by the IRD. Reciprocity agreement with Australia Since only as recently as 2000, New Zealand has a reciprocity agreement with Australia whether the Australian Tax Office collects child support for NZ residents from Liable Parents in Australia. While they also collect child support arrears, they only pursue the last 2 years of arrears. The Child Support Amendment Act [2013] The Child Support Amendment Act [2013] was to come into effect on 1 April 2014, however as the proposed changes have been so problematic for the IRD to implement, these changes were delayed until 1 April 2015. When the law change comes into effect, it significant changes to the way child support is calculated in New Zealand. The major changes include: * increasing the minimum weekly child support from $15 per week to $35 per week, which will be annually adjusted for inflation * removing from the living allowance an increase for a partner, or for children of the partner that are not the children of the liable parent. * take both parents income into account for the assessment * making employers make compulsory child support deductions from liable parents wages * now includes non taxable income as assessable income * Gives the IRD more discretion to waive child support penalties External links *Link to IRD child support website *Link to IRD child support Calculator *Link to Child Support Act 1991 *Link to Child Support Rules References Category:Child support ","title":"Child Support (New Zealand)"},{"id":"39173473","text":"NA-260 (Quetta-cum-Chagai-cum-Mastung) () was a constituency for the National Assembly of Pakistan.

In the mid 1960s migrants and their children made up half of Canberra's 80,000 population. Community clubs, including for example those founded by Italian, German and Polish migrants, were recognised as important for welcoming new settlers, providing venues to socialise and reminisce. Background From the laying of its foundation stone in 1913, the progress of building Canberra, the new capital city of Australia, was slow. The First World War, the Great Depression and then the Second World War meant resources for construction were limited. After the 1939-45 War suburban growth was essential to house the public servants whose Commonwealth Departments were moving to the nation's administrative centre. The population grew from around 17,000 in 1947 to over 30,000 in 1954. Skilled tradespeople were in severe shortage and housing construction firm A V Jennings was forced to seek carpenters from Germany. =The Jennings Germans= A V Jennings was contracted by the government in 1950 to build 1850 homes but the limited availability of local tradesmen led to sourcing qualified migrants. Canberra's Technical College building trades head and an interpreter travelled to Germany to test and recruit 150 men from the 2,500 men who had responded to advertisements. The men arrived in Australia on two year contracts and commenced work in January 1952. Within the two years, 1800 new houses had been completed. Around 100 of the men chose to stay in Australia when their contracts were over. They were known as the Jennings Germans. Club foundation The section of the Berlin Wall outside the Harmonie German Club Those Jennings Germans still in Canberra, along with other German expatriates, including some who had migrated to Australia to work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, founded the Harmonie German Club in the Canberra suburb of Narrabundah. Work on the club began in August 1962 and was built by volunteer labour. The foundation stone was laid in 1963 and the club was opened a year later. In 1972 it was extended, becoming the largest of Canberra's migrant clubs. In 1992 a section of the Berlin Wall was installed outside the club. Reunions Jennings Germans have attended reunions at the club since 1965. Albert Jennings attended the 25th anniversary of their arrival, in 1977. Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Michael MacKellar wrote to congratulate their success \\"One would have to look far to find a better example of migration to Australia than that of the 150 German carpenters who arrived in Canberra 25 years ago... [They] faced their difficulties, built their houses and, fortunately for us, most of them decided to stay and build their lives here too.\\" Canberra Oktoberfest In 1963 a group of Jennings Germans expats from Munich instigated Canberra's annual three-day Oktoberfest and the club has organised it every year except 2020, which is cancelled on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic. The festival includes such traditional German celebrations as folk dancing, bands, food and beers. It has attracted attendances of up to 25,000. The festivities outgrew the club's facilities and in 2017 Oktoberfest was staged in nearby Queanbeyan.

It was written by Bathsheba Doran and Noelle Valdivia and directed by Michael Morris. The episode premiered on NBC on April 20, 2013, the twelfth episode of Season 2. After months of hurdles, Bombshell's opening night is here. As Ivy's nerves get the better of her, support comes from an unlikely source. Meanwhile, Tom and Julia look to their next project. Bombshell's success may be in jeopardy as Eileen's issues with Richard come to a head. Jimmy reveals all to Karen about his dark past. Plot Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) is suddenly very nervous just before she goes on for Bombshell's opening night. Her mom Leigh Conroy (Bernadette Peters) tells her not to worry and that she's very proud of her. Ivy brings down the house. Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) and Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez) are still not on good speaking terms, but Ana tells her that she met Adam (David Call), who says he's Jimmy's brother and that Jimmy is bad news. Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan) tells Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus) that he wants to come clean with Karen about his sordid past. Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) are having trouble deciding what project they want to do next. Tom gets an offer to direct a revival of City of Angels and he seriously considers it. Julia tells him she's getting the rights to do The Great Gatsby, which they wanted to do when they first met, but Tom demurs. Julia hears about the directing job and lays into Tom for not telling her the truth. He says he loves writing with her, but directing is what he wants to do right now. At Bombshell's premiere before the show starts, Jimmy tells Karen about his past, that he was abused as a kid. After his mom died, his brother Adam got him on the streets selling and using drugs and that he wasn't a good person. He says Kyle saved him and is his real brother and Adam means nothing to him. At the after-party, Jimmy sees Adam with Ana and wants to fight him, but Karen asks him to behave. Kyle gets up the courage to tell Adam to leave and then pushes him. Jimmy jumps in and punches Adam who fights back. Eileen breaks it up with a cold ice bucket. Karen tells Jimmy she's not happy with how he handled the altercation and says she's done with him because he's not willing to change. Also at the after-party, Karen goes to the ladies room and runs into Ivy. Karen tells her that she felt jealous that Ivy had the role and that she did great. They make up. Later at the party, Ivy thanks various people and also thanks Karen and asks her to perform a number with her; they perform a rousing version of \\"That's Life\\". Afterwards, Ivy finds out that Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) asked Karen out a few weeks ago and she turned him down. Ivy is a little put out because that's when she and Derek started seeing each other again. She spurns his offer to spend the night without telling him why. The reviews are mostly very positive, though producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston) is not really happy with The New York Times' slightly more tepid reviews and tells the editor Richard Francis (Jamey Sheridan) that she doesn't want to see him anymore. Her publicist Agnes (Daphne Rubin-Vega) thinks their publicity campaign should be cautious given the Times review, but Eileen decides to double down on the promo budget and says they'll go for Tony nominations to increase excitement for the show. Derek runs into Daisy Parker (Mara Davi), who previously sued him for sexual harassment. She apologizes to him for the suit and says she was part of it only to help further her career. He asks her what she's doing right now and they go off together. Julia and Scott Nichols (Jesse L. Martin) are in a car after the party and after Julia tells him of her and Tom's troubles, he suggests she do Gatsby at his theater and then kisses her. Tom is drinking alone at a restaurant and Kyle runs into him. They talk a bit and Tom asks him if he wants to leave with him. Kyle hesitates and says he should check on Jimmy, but then accepts Tom's offer and they leave together. Production There were several star cameos in the episode. Actress/comedian Rosie O'Donnell played herself as one of Bombshell's audience members. Songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (who also write songs for and are executive producers of Smash) played themselves, also in attendance to see Bombshell. Shaiman is also drafted by Ivy to play piano for the performance of \\"That's Life\\". Emory Cohen reprised his role as Julia's son Leo, even though he had been let go from the cast after the first season. There were two songs featured in the episode, one original (a reprise) and one cover (\\"That's Life\\", mostly popularized by Frank Sinatra). The show's in- house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote the reprised \\"Don't Forget Me\\" (sung by Megan Hilty). \\"That's Life\\" was sung by Katharine McPhee and Hilty. \\"That's Life\\" was released as a single the same week the episode aired. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" with McPhee's vocals is currently available on the cast album Bombshell.

Battle On 28 January, a suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into an army checkpoint in Rada, near the town of al-Manasseh, killing eleven Yemeni soldiers and wounding another 17 more. The checkpoints were set up just days prior to the attack, but after the announcement of the offensive the suicide bomber detonated his explosive car at one. The same day, militants ambushed and killed three Yemeni soldiers in a separate attack, on the outskirts of Radda. On 29 March, clashes erupted in Radda after a group of insurgents said to be from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raided a military checkpoint of the Republican guards at the main entrance to Rada. At least two militants were killed and one Yemeni soldiers were killed. On 27 April, fighting resumed in Radda, leaving five Yemeni soldiers and two militants dead.

A gunfight followed between Yemeni troops and the insurgents, reportedly killing two of the attackers.

A red squirrel, S. vulgaris, native to Europe. Europe's grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) originated in North America, where they are known as eastern gray squirrelsBertolino, S. & Piero, G. (2003) Spread and attempted eradication of the grey squirrel (Sciurus caolinensis) in Italy, and consequences for the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in Eurasia. Biological Conservation, 351-358 (to differentiate from western gray squirrels). They eat large seeds, flowers, buds, fruits, fungi, some insects and occasionally bird eggs.Sandro, B. (2008) Introduction of the American grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe: a case study in biological invasion. Current Science, vol. 95, No. 7, 903-906. They were first introduced into England, in a concerted way, in 1876, and through rapidly growing population and further introductions they spread to the rest of Great Britain by the early-to-mid 20th century. The eastern grey squirrel was introduced to Continental Europe in 1948 and has quickly taken advantage of Europe's food sources, habitats and lack of predators for grey squirrels. The native squirrel in Europe is the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). Both species have similar diets, use similar locations of the environment and have similar activity patterns; however, there is no evidence of noticeable aggression between the two species. These eastern grey squirrels are considered an invasive species in Europe because of their presence contributing to the displacement of the red squirrels. The invasion of the grey squirrel in the United Kingdom can be classified as a Disease Mediated Invasion (DMI).Strauss, A., White, A., & Boots, M. (2012) Invading with biological weapons: the importance of disease-mediated invasions. Functional Ecology, 26, 1249-1261. More specifically, the invasion of the grey squirrels and displacement of the red squirrels can be described by \\"spillover DMI\\", which is defined as a non-native species bringing diseases with them into the new area that will infect the native species. Spillover is especially an issue of when the invading species is morphologically similar to the native one. This can have devastating effects. Introduction of grey squirrel to Europe Grey squirrels have been introduced either on purpose or by accident in many places throughout the world. They were first introduced into England, in a concerted way, in 1876, and through rapidly growing population and further introductions they spread to the rest of Great Britain by the early-to-mid 20th century. The first reported introduction of grey squirrels in continental Europe was in 1948, and they were taken to Stupinigi, Italy, where there is still a growing population. In Ireland however, Lord Longford was said to have introduced the American squirrels into his estate in 1911. Then in 1966, five squirrels were introduced to Nervi, Italy in the park of Genoa. Later in 1994, three pairs were again released to a park in Trecate but were captured and removed in 1996. As stated before, not all grey squirrel introductions were intentional. For example, in 1966 two females and one male escaped from a game farm on Vancouver Island.Simberloff, D. (2008) Rats are not the only introduced rodents producing ecosystem impacts on islands. Biological Invasions, 1735-1742. Almost 80% of known grey squirrel introductions worldwide resulted in successful establishment in the new area.Lawton, C., Cowan, P., Bertolino, S., Lurz, P.P.W. & Peters, A.R. (2010) The consequences of introducing non-indigenous species: two case studies, the grey squirrel in Europe and the brushtail possum in New Zealand. Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 29 (2), 287-297. Typically, grey squirrels do not need large numbers to start a new population. From studying all of the known successful introductions of this species, 71.4% used fewer than 10 individuals. This efficiency in the spread of grey squirrels can be explained by the \\"enemy release hypothesis\\", which is when the invading species has better survival because its natural predators are not present. Also, natural parasites typically are not present in the area that the species has been introduced or has invaded. Because the grey squirrel poses such a threat to the trees and red squirrel in Europe, there is great effort to stop the further spread of the grey squirrels. Impact on other species=Competition for food= One of the biggest concerns about the grey squirrel as an invasive species is the effect introduction has on populations of red squirrels. Grey and red squirrels compete for resources, and greys will pilfer food caches of red squirrels.Bertolino, S., Lurz, P.W.W., Sanderson, R. & Rushton, S.P. (2008) Predicting the spread of the American grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe: A call for a co-ordinated European approach. Biological Conservation, 141, 2564-2575.Gossa, A., La Morgia, V., Marchisio, P., et al. (2012) Does a larger carrying capacity for an exotic species allow environment invasion? - Some considerations on the competition of red and grey squirrels. Journal of Biological Systems, 20, 221-234. Reduction in red squirrel individual growth, juvenile recruitment, and reproductive success has been linked to competition between grey and red squirrels. In areas of large core overlap between red and grey squirrel populations, a reduction in body mass of red squirrels during the Spring has been observed. This is most likely due to the fact that reds and greys participate in direct competition for limited resources, suggesting there is no niche partitioning occurring. This direct competition also explains a decrease in juvenile recruitment and reproductive success, as immature reds will die due to lack of resources before reaching sexual maturity. =Poxvirus= In addition to competition for resources, the spread of the squirrel poxvirus from grey squirrels to reds is thought to be a major factor in the decline of red squirrel populations. Grey squirrels do not die from the squirrelpox virus and can infect red squirrels causing the appearance of scabs and lesions on the face, feet, and genitals and eventually death. In Great Britain, grey squirrels have been able to spread 17-25 times faster through competitive exclusion of the red squirrel due to increased mortality of reds from the squirrelpox virus. In fact, the virus works so quickly in killing its host after infection that seeing a red squirrel with poxvirus is uncommon even though the disease may be highly prevalent in a red squirrel population. The full consequences of these interactions cannot be completely determined, though the difference in population density and weight of the two species may have an effect on energy flow in ecosystems. =Woodland and songbird species= Grey squirrels also bear some of the responsibility for the decline of select woodland and songbird bird species as they sometimes feed on bird eggs and chicks.Bertolino, S. & Lurz, P. (2011) Callosciurus squirrels: worldwide introductions, ecological impacts and recommendations to prevent the establishment of new invasive populations. Mammal Review, 22-33. Although the grey squirrel is often blamed in part for this decline in the UK, this is probably not the case for populations introduced to Italy. In those populations, the greys mainly feed on \\"seeds, fruits, buds, flowers and, occasionally, on insects, switching from one resource to another according to seasonal availability\\". =Bark stripping= Certain behaviour of the grey squirrel, such as bark stripping, also has negative effects on trees and timber plantations. This is thought to be biggest effect introduced squirrels have on island ecosystems. For example, Garry oak trees on Vancouver Island have become endangered due to urban development and the presence of invasive species including the grey squirrel. Scatter-hoarding of seeds by grey squirrels causes notching in the acorns of white oaks. Notching prevents germination, which can hinder natural forest regeneration. Bark stripping makes branches weaker and more susceptible to being broken off by wind or animals and can also cause secondary infection that may lead to death. Bark stripping makes trees more susceptible to red band needle blight (RBNB), which is caused by the asexual stage of the fungus Dothistroma septosporum. RBNB results in a necrotrophic infection that kills needle tissue in pine species. Phytophthora ramorum is another fungus affecting tree health.Craig M. Shuttleworth, C. M.; Lurz, P.; Geddes, N.; Browne, J. (2012) Integrating red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) habitat requirements with the management of pathogenic tree disease in commercial forests in the UK. Forest Ecology and Management 279, 167‚Äì175. Trees between 10 and 40 years of age and certain species, including beech and sycamore, are more vulnerable than others. Grey squirrels also damage trees by eating their sap, suggesting this behaviour provides some nutritional benefit. Predicted spread=Predicted spread throughout Europe= Spatially explicit population dynamics models were used by Bertolino et al. 2008 to predict the spread of the grey squirrel populations present in Italy in 1996: the Piedmont, Genoa, and Ticino populations. The models examined potential corridors that would allow grey squirrels to invade France and Switzerland and the time scale of such invasions. In a scenario based on a random pattern of good, poor, and mast year seed crops (vegetation produces significant abundance of food resources), in the \\"best case\\" scenario, grey squirrels will reach the Western Alps between 2026 and 2036, France between 2066 and 2071, and Switzerland between 2051 and 2066. In a scenario where poor year seed crops were not included, the \\"worst case\\" scenario, grey squirrels will reach the Western Alps by 2015, France by 2026, and Switzerland between 2031 and 2041. Along the border between France and Italy, the forest cover is mainly composed of mixed broadleaf trees; this represents a likely corridor to France for the grey squirrel. Mixed deciduous woodland lines the Ticino river; this area connects with contiguous hardwood on the side of Lake Maggiore in Switzerland, making the area along the Ticino river a likely corridor for the grey squirrel to invade Switzerland. The upper portion of the Alps is covered largely by coniferous forest. Grey squirrels, which are heavier than native red squirrels, have a higher energy requirement than red squirrels. It may be difficult for the grey squirrels to attain their higher energy requirement in this environment because they may have difficulty reaching the small seeds contained in the conifers' cones; for this reason, grey squirrel performance in this habitat will affect the spread of the species. Eventually, if populations are left unchecked, the grey squirrel will spread through a large portion of continental Europe and Eurasia, potentially invading the entire global distribution of the red squirrel. =Predicted spread of the poxvirus and damage to trees= The squirrelpox virus is predicted to spread by the grey squirrels as they act as a vector for the virus. Further, a separate model examining the effects of the spread of the grey squirrel on the health of Scots and lodgepole pines showed that grey squirrels will spread red band needle blight (RBNB), decreasing the population of lodgepole pines exponentially, and that Scots pine populations will decrease slower due to fungal growth resulting from the bark-stripping behaviour of the grey squirrel. =Continued spread after attempted eradication= In 1991, eradication of a grey squirrel population in Piedmont was attempted via trapping and euthanasia; however, this effort was suspended for three years after animal rights groups filed a lawsuit. During the three-year suspension, the grey squirrel population had grown so much that it was no longer feasible to attempt eradication by the methods initially used. If the species spreads significantly (the three populations in Italy invade France or Switzerland and establish successful populations outside of Italy) before preventative or eradicative efforts are taken, it will, in all probability, be too late for effective action. Natural predator European pine martens have kept grey squirrel populations in check in Ireland The European pine marten is a natural predator of squirrels, including the eastern grey squirrel, but has been eradicated from large parts of the area affected by the grey squirrel such as England and Wales. The European pine marten's population is currently expanding and there is evidence that grey squirrel populations plummet where it becomes present, with the populations of the co-evolved red squirrel subsequently recovering.George Monbiot, How to eradicate grey squirrels without firing a shot, Guardian, January 30, 2015.Emma Sheehy & Colin Lawton, Population crash in an invasive species following the recovery of a native predator: the case of the American grey squirrel and the European pine marten in Ireland, Biodiversity and Conservation, March 2014, Volume 23, Issue 3, pp. 753-774. Proposed plans for control or eradication Although the negative consequences of introduction of non-native species are generally known in the scientific community, the majority of the public is unaware of the effects on native ecosystems.Shine, R. & Doody, J. S. (2011) Invasive species control: understanding conflicts between researchers and the general community. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9: 400‚Äì406. Effective control of the spreading of grey squirrels throughout continental Europe will require a coordinated approach of many nations, and ecologists recommend public education and trade restrictions as primary means to prevent new introductions of non-native species. Currently, the release of non-native species is illegal in most European countries, but both illegal and allowed importations and escapes of grey squirrels from captivity pose threats to native red squirrel and tree populations. In addition to preventing introduction of grey squirrels, containment and eradication could serve to control the species‚Äô invasive actions. Methods for grey squirrel population control depend on the target of protection. In the presence of red squirrels, cage trapping or shooting can be effective. In the absence of red squirrels, poisoning by the anticoagulant Warfarin can be used in special feeding hoppers. These methods are currently effectively controlling the grey squirrel population in Britain. Selectively timed culls, or removal of a percentage of the breeding individuals, of grey squirrel populations can help control and prevent tree damage. Although grey squirrel populations readily recover from culls, their coincidence with annual periods of the greatest damage to trees, typically between April and September when the squirrels are most active in foraging among broadleaf tree populations, can minimize tree damage. Alternatively, non-lethal methods of population control, such as fertility treatments, are being developed, although the effectiveness of these treatments is unknown. In areas most threatened by spread of grey squirrels, eradication may be more effective than population containment. Eradication of the population of grey squirrels in Genoa would protect two native subspecies of red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris italicus and Sciurus vulgaris meridionalis, in south east Italy, and eradication of the grey squirrel population in Ticino would eliminate the threat of grey squirrel invasion into Switzerland for the next 100 years. While these efforts are supported by ecologists, their success will depend on public opinion, governmental support, and awareness of the situation.

The conflict has been ongoing since 1984 and resulted in some 40,000‚Äì100,000 mortal casualties and great economic losses for Turkey as well as high damage to the Kurdish population. Though there was a unilateral cease-fire between 1999 and 2004, the sides failed to gain understanding and the conflict became increasingly violent. The 2013 truce was working until September 2014. But when the relations became strained due to spillover of the Syrian Civil War; the truce fully collapsed in July 2015, following the Ceylanpƒ±nar incidents as a Casus belli to renewed full-scale warfare in South-Eastern Turkey. Background The Turkey-PKK conflict is an armed conflict between the Republic of Turkey and people related to Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which have demanded freedom from Turkey to create an independent Kurdistan,Globalsecurity.org Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or to have autonomyPress TV 'PKK ready to swap arms for autonomy' and greater political and cultural rights for Kurds inside the Republic of Turkey. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States,United States Department of State Foreign Terrorist Organizations the European UnionEuropean Union List of Terrorist Organisations, Council of the european union, updated Council Decision 2011/70/CFSP of 31 January 2011 and NATO. Although insurgents have carried out attacks in many regions of Turkey, the insurgency is mainly in southeastern Turkey. The PKK's military presence in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, which it uses as launchpad for attacks on Turkey, has resulted in the Turkish military carrying out frequent ground incursions and air and artillery strikes in the region, as the Kurdistan Regional Government claimed they do not have sufficient military forces to prevent the PKK from operating. The conflict has particularly affected Turkey's tourism industryPKK: Targets and activities, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey), Federation of American Scientists. and has cost the economy of Turkey an estimated 300 to 450 billion dollars, mainly military expenses.Turkey: The PKK and a Kurdish settlement , September 11, 2012 Since the PKK was founded on November 27, 1978, it has been involved in armed clashes with Turkish security forces. The full-scale insurgency however, did not begin until August 15, 1984 when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. The first insurgency lasted until September 1, 1999 when the PKK declared a unilateral cease-fire. The armed conflict was later resumed on June 1, 2004, when the PKK declared an end to its cease-fire. Since summer 2011, the conflict has become increasingly violent with resumption of large- scale hostilities. Developments On the eve of 2012 (28 December), in a television interview upon a question of whether the government had a project to solve the issue, Erdoƒüan stated that the government was in negotiations with jailed rebel leader √ñcalan. The negotiations were initially named the Solution Process (√á√∂z√ºm S√ºreci) in public. While negotiations were going on, there were numerous events that were regarded as sabotage to derail the talks: The assassination of the PKK administrators in Paris Sakine Cansƒ±z, Fidan Doƒüan and Leyla S√∂ylemez in Paris, revealing √ñcalan's talks with the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) publicly via the Milliyet newspaper and finally, the bombings of the Justice Ministry of Turkey and Erdoƒüan's office at the Justice and Development Party (AKP) headquarters in Ankara. However, both parties vehemently condemned all three events as they occurred and stated that they were determined anyway. Finally on 21 March 2013, after months of negotiations with the Turkish Government, Abdullah Ocalan's message to the people was read both in Turkish and Kurdish during the Nowruz celebrations in Diyarbakƒ±r. The letter called a cease-fire that included disarmament and withdrawal from Turkish soil and calling an end to armed struggle. PKK announced that they would obey, stating that the year of 2013 is the year of solution either through war or through peace. Erdoƒüan welcomed the letter stating that concrete steps will follow PKK's withdrawal. On 25 April 2013, the PKK announced that it withdraws all its forces within Turkey to Northern Iraq. According to the government and the Kurds and to most of the press, this move marks the end of a 30-year-old conflict. The second phase which includes constitutional and legal changes towards the recognition of human rights of the Kurds starts simultaneously with withdrawal.* Arin, Kubilay Yado , Turkey and the Kurds ‚Äì From War to Reconciliation? UC Berkeley Center for Right Wing Studies Working Paper Series, March 26, 2015.https://www.academia.edu/11674094/Turkey_and_the_Kurds_From_War_to_Reconciliation =Wise people committee= The government announced its long-awaited list of \\"wise men\\" on April 4, the members of a seven-region commission tasked with explaining the ongoing settlement process with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to the public and promoting the negotiations. Deputy Prime Minister B√ºlent Arƒ±n√ß announced the list of \\"wise people\\", several weeks after the government first announced plans to set up such a commission made up of intellectuals and well-liked public figures. The list includes celebrities who are intellectuals, writers and academics as well as singers such as Orhan Gencebay. The commission is made up of groups organized on a regional basis, and will be active in seven regions across the country. On Tuesday, while mystery still shrouded the identities of the government's list of wise people, Erdoƒüan said, \\"We will listen to the views and suggestions of the people who are part of this delegation, consult with them and they will organize some events in [the country's] regions and get together with our citizens and local public opinion leaders.\\" In a speech on March 23, the prime minister defined the role of the commission, saying they will be conducting a \\"psychological operation,\\" indicating the wise people will act as public relations agents. In a speech he made in Ankara on March 23, Erdoƒüan stated, \\"It is important to prepare the public for this and social perceptions should be created by the wise men.\\" He said only public acceptance can fend off nationalistic shows. The Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) were critical of the wise men list, claiming that the people on the list are all supportive of the government. On April 5, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan met for the first time with members of the wise men commission. After five weeks of work, the Wise Persons committee gave its first report to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and shared their impressions on the level of support regarding the process.
