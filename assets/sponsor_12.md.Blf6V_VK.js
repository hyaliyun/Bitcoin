Family names from these settlers include Gould, Young, Phillips, Burr, Sexton, Brooks, Alden and Loomis. The community's first post office, only the second established in the county, opened in 1822. The community takes its name from nearby French Creek, a tributary of the Buckhannon River watershed. The village was also referred to as Meadeville, as it is located in the magisterial Meade District. The French Creek Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The land was donated to the church by the Young family.

In the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì72) John Marius Wilson described Leath: The ward largely corresponds to that part of the modern Eden District that lies within Cumberland that is the former Penrith urban and rural districts and the Alston with Garrigill Rural District. Market towns in the ward were Penrith (the largest settlement and seat of local government), Kirkoswald and Alston. At one time, the village of Greystoke had held markets. A large part of the ward once made up the main part of the Royal hunting ground known as Inglewood Forest, which was subject to Forest Laws up until the reign of Henry VIII. The manors of Penrith, Langwathby, Castle Sowerby and Great Salkeld and at times Glassonby and Gamblesby were part of the royal estate known as the Honour of Penrith, which eventually passed into the hands of the Dukes of Devonshire.

The site of Florida's largest Civil War battle, the Battle of Olustee. The park is located west of Jacksonville and east of Lake City, on U.S. 90. It also has the distinction of being the first park in the Florida State Park system. The State of Florida actually owns only of the Park, but manages another of the original battlefield under a Special Use Permit from the United States Forest Service. Under the title of Olustee Battlefield, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 12 August 1970. History Survivors of the Battle of Olustee at the monument dedication on October 23, 1912. The Battle of Olustee was fought on the afternoon of 20 February 1864. It is recreated annually during that month by Civil War reenactors. In 1897, the Florida Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) began raising funds to place a monument at the battle site. Two years later, the Florida Legislature appropriated $2,500.00 and established a commission to oversee construction of the monument. The project was completed in 1912, and the monument was officially dedicated on 23 October 1912. The UDC administered the Olustee Battlefield Memorial until 1949, when the Florida Board of Parks and Historic Memorials assumed responsibility. Today the Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park is administered by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Recreation and Parks.After The Battle of Olustee Battle Of Olustee Web site.

Amenities include a one-mile (1.6 km) hiking trail with interpretive displays, picnic tables and a small interpretive center about the battle. In addition, the Florida Trail goes through the Historic Site, with the Olustee Trailhead close to the main entrance on U.S. 90. The park has a very active Citizen Support Organization of volunteers who put on an annual reenactment. On Presidents' Day weekend each February (see Notes), thousands of reenactors from across the U.S. and even from overseas come to the Park to reenact the Battle of Olustee. Reenactors begin arriving as early as Thursday to set up. Friday is designated \\"School Day\\" as thousands of students arrive to spend the day watching demonstrations and listening to living historians discuss various aspects of the war and as well as life in the United States during the 1860s. The public is invited to attend on Friday (no battle reenactment), and on Saturday and Sunday. On all three days visitors can tour the camps, view demonstrations, interact with living historians, shop at numerous sutler tents for authentic Civil War merchandise, and attend the battles reenacted on Saturday and Sunday only. A large selection of modern-day food is continuously available from Friday through Sunday at the park.Olustee Battlefield Reenactment Battle Of Olustee Web site.

The restriction to a subspace of a projection is also called a projection, even if the idempotence property is lost. An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (paper sheet). The projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet. The shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself (idempotency). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk. Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in Euclidean geometry to denote the projection of the Euclidean space of three dimensions onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: * The projection from a point onto a plane or central projection: If C is a point, called the center of projection, then the projection of a point P different from C onto a plane that does not contain C is the intersection of the line CP with the plane. The points P such that the line CP is parallel to the plane does not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see projective geometry for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point C itself is not defined. * The projection parallel to a direction D, onto a plane or parallel projection: The image of a point P is the intersection with the plane of the line parallel to D passing through P. See for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension. The concept of projection in mathematics is a very old one, most likely has its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real-world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time different versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations. In cartography, a map projection is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The 3D projections are also at the basis of the theory of perspective. The need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of projective geometry. However, a projective transformation is a bijection of a projective space, a property not shared with the projections of this article.  Definition  The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection œÄ, for any map f and set X. In an abstract setting we can generally say that a projection is a mapping of a set (or of a mathematical structure) which is idempotent, which means that a projection is equal to its composition with itself. A projection may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse. Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let p be an idempotent map from a set A into itself (thus p ‚àò p = p) and B = p(A) be the image of p. If we denote by œÄ the map p viewed as a map from A onto B and by i the injection of B into A (so that p = i ‚àò œÄ), then we have œÄ ‚àò i = IdB (so that œÄ has a right inverse). Conversely, if œÄ has a right inverse, then œÄ ‚àò i = IdB implies that i ‚àò œÄ is idempotent.  Applications  The original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example: * In set theory: ** An operation typified by the j th projection map, written projj , that takes an element x = (x1, ..., xj , ..., xk) of the cartesian product X1 √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Xj √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Xk to the value projj (x) = xj . This map is always surjective. ** A mapping that takes an element to its equivalence class under a given equivalence relation is known as the '. ** The evaluation map sends a function f to the value f(x) for a fixed x. The space of functions YX can be identified with the cartesian product \\\\prod_{i\\\\in X}Y_i, and the evaluation map is a projection map from the cartesian product. * For relational databases and query languages, the projection is a unary operation written as \\\\Pi_{a_1, \\\\ldots,a_n}( R ) where a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the set that is obtained when all tuples in R are restricted to the set \\\\\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\\\\\}. R is a database-relation. * In spherical geometry, projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by Ptolemy (~150) in his Planisphaerium. The method is called stereographic projection and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a pole C diametrically opposite the point of tangency. Any point P on the sphere besides C determines a line CP intersecting the plane at the projected point for P. The correspondence makes the sphere a one- point compactification for the plane when a point at infinity is included to correspond to C, which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the complex plane where the compactification corresponds to the Riemann sphere. Alternatively, a hemisphere is frequently projected onto a plane using the gnomonic projection. * In linear algebra, a linear transformation that remains unchanged if applied twice (p(u) = p(p(u))), in other words, an idempotent operator. For example, the mapping that takes a point (x, y, z) in three dimensions to the point (x, y, 0) in the plane is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions n for the source and k ‚â§ n for the target of the mapping. See orthogonal projection, projection (linear algebra). In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well. * In differential topology, any fiber bundle includes a projection map as part of its definition. Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology and is therefore open and surjective. * In topology, a retraction is a continuous map r: X ‚Üí X which restricts to the identity map on its image. This satisfies a similar idempotency condition r2 = r and can be considered a generalization of the projection map. The image of a retraction is called a retract of the original space. A retraction which is homotopic to the identity is known as a deformation retraction. This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism. * The scalar projection (or resolute) of one vector onto another. * In category theory, the above notion of cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary categories. The product of some objects has a canonical projection morphism to each factor. This projection will take many forms in different categories. The projection from the Cartesian product of sets, the product topology of topological spaces (which is always surjective and open), or from the direct product of groups, etc. Although these morphisms are often epimorphisms and even surjective, they do not have to be.

Early life He was born in the Caucasian region of Daghestan, then colony of the Russian Empire, in 1891.'The Naqshbandi Sufi Way' by Hisham Kabbani. KAZI Publications, 1995. Both his father and elder brother were medical doctors, the latter being a surgeon in the Imperial Russian Army. Shaykh Abdullah was raised and trained by his maternal uncle, Shaykh Sharafuddin Daghestani (1875‚Äì1936). Move to Ottoman Turkey In the late 1890s Shaykh Abdullah's family emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, following his uncle shaykh Sharafuddin who had emigrated in the 1870s. They settled in the northwestern Anatolian city of Bursa and then, after a year, moved to Re≈üadiye, now known as G√ºneyk√∂y, Turkey. A new village was established that was populated by Daghestani refugees. Shortly thereafter, Shaykh Abdullah‚Äôs father died, and at the age of fifteen, he married a Daghestani named Halima. Training in Sufism In 1910, after merely six months of marriage, Shaykh Sharafuddin ordered Abdullah into sacred seclusion (khalwat) for five years. This practice included severe austerities that were intended to raise his spiritual rank. When Abdullah returned to secular life the Ottoman Empire was embroiled in the First World War. Along with many young men of his village, Abdullah entered military service and took part in the Battle of Gallipoli. During a firefight he was severely wounded by enemy fire. In 1921, Abdullah was instructed by Shaykh Sharafuddin to enter another five years seclusion. He completed this and was then granted a license, or ijazah, to be a master, or shaykh, in the Naqshbandi order. Interlude in Egypt Because of anti-Sufi regulations in the new Turkish Republic, Shaykh Abdullah began to contemplate leaving the country. After the death of Shaykh Sharafuddin in 1936, a delegation came to Re≈üadiye from King Farouk to pay their condolences, as he had many followers in Egypt. One of Shaykh Abdullah's daughters married a member of the delegation. Shaykh Abdullah and the family then moved to Egypt, though they would remain there for only half a year as the marriage soon ended in divorce. Life in Syria Following his daughter's divorce, Shaykh Abdullah and his family then moved to Syria where he would remain for the rest of his life. He resided for a time in Aleppo, moved to Homs and then finally to Damascus near the tomb of saint Sa‚Äôd ad-Din Jibawi. There, he established the first tekke for his branch of the Naqshbandi order. In 1943, he moved to a house on Jabal Qasioun mountain. The house was bought by his first Syrian murid and later one of his deputies in the Sufi order, Shaykh Husayn Ifrini. This house is now the site of his burial shrine and its adjoining mosque. Death Shaykh Abdullah died on September 30, 1973 in Damascus. His grave and burial shrine is in Damascus, Syria, at the site of his former home and mosque on Jabal Qasioun mountain. Notable followers Among his notable followers were the Sufi shaykhs Nazim al-Haqqani, adil Merlet, Husayn Ifrini, Hisham Kabbani, and Adnan Kabbani. One of his successors, Shaykh Nazim, went on to spread this branch of the Naqshbandi Sufi order to many countries in the world and was considered among the world's most influential Muslims. Controversy Dagestani Sufi shaykh Said Afandi al- Chirkawi (d. 2012), former head of another branch of the Naqshbandi Sufi path, denied the legitimacy of the ijaza, or authorization, of Shaykh Abdullah's teacher, Shaykh Sharafuddin.cf. this article, often cited as \\"proof\\" where Shaykh al-Chirkawi questions Shaykh Sharafuddin's ijaza therein: See also *John G.

His major work was Rerum Gallicarum et Francicarum Scriptores, a collection of the historians of Gaul and France, which covers the time from France's earliest history until the year 987. Biography Bouquet was born at Amiens. As a boy he wanted to become a priest, but later decided to become a Benedictine monk. He joined the Congregation of St Maur and took vows at the monastery of St Faron, at Meaux on 16 August 1706. Shortly after he became a priest his superiors appointed him librarian at the monastery of St.-Germain-des-Pr√©s, which at that time possessed a library of 60,000 books and 8,000 manuscripts. Being well versed in ancient Greek, Bouquet assisted his confr√®re Bernard de Montfaucon in his edition of the works of John Chrysostom. He himself was preparing a new edition of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, and had already progressed far in his work when he heard that the Dutch writer Sigebert Haverkamp was engaged on a new edition of the same author. He sent all the material he had collected to Haverkamp, who embodied it in his edition. Bouquet's greatest work is his collection of the historians of Gaul and France, entitled: Rerum Gallicarum et Francicarum Scriptores. Attempts to collect the sources of French history had been made at various times. Thus Pierre Pithou (died 1596) had collected some material, and Andr√© Duchesne (died 1640) had begun a work entitled \\"Histori√¶ Francorum Scriptores\\", to be published in twenty-four volumes, but died before finishing the fifth volume. Colbert, the great French minister of finance, desired to have Duchesne's work continued at the expense of the State, but he died in 1683 without finding a suitable historian to complete what Duchesne had begun. In 1717 D'Aguesseau, who was then chancellor, entrusted to the Benedictine Edmond Mart√®ne the drawing up of a new plan for the work. The design was accepted and the Oratorian LeLong who had just finished his \\"Biblioth√®que historique de la France\\" was entrusted with the task. Mart√®ne died shortly after he had begun, in 1721. The Congregation of St.-Maur undertook the publication of the work. Dionysius de Sainte-Marte, who was then superior-general of the congregation, placed Bouquet in charge of the undertaking. Bouquet began an entirely new work and had the first two volumes ready for print in 1729, but their publication was delayed. Some monks of the Congregation of St.-Maur refused to submit to the Bull Unigenitus which was directed against Pasquier Quesnel. Bouquet submitted after some hesitation. When, however, Cardinal De Bissy required the monks of St.-Germain-des-Pr√©s to sign a formula of submission he had drawn up, Bouquet and seven others refused their signature because De Bissy, being merely Abbot in commendam of St.-Germain-des-Pr√©s, had no spiritual jurisdiction over the monks. Bouquet was banished to the monastery of St.-Jean, at L√¢on, but in 1735, D'Aguesseau and a few other influential persons succeeded in having him recalled to Argenteuil, and afterwards to Blancs-Manteaux, where he could more easily supervise the publication of his work. He brought out eight volumes between 1738 and 1752. The greater part of the material for the ninth volume was ready when Bouquet died at the monastery of Blancs-Manteaux, in Paris. The eight volumes published comprise the sources of the history of France from the earliest days of its existence to the year 987. The work was continued by other members of the Congregation of St.-Maur in the following order: vols. IX-X were published by the two brothers, John and Charles Haudiquier; vol. XI, by Housseau, Pr√©cieux, and Poirier; vols. XII-XIII, by Cl√©ment and Brial; vols. XIV-XVIII, by Brial. The remaining five volumes were published by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions which completed the work in 1876. A new edition in twenty-five volumes, undertaken by Leopold Delisle, a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions, reached the twenty-fourth volume.

Plot The introduction shows the Dungaga, an imperial industrialized race, conquering the more spiritual Lorian race. The protagonist, Mia, is the daughter of the Lorian priestess and an unknown father. Like the rest of her people, she is enslaved to do menial labor under the supervision of her half-brother Hume. As she sees her Dungaga stepfather Gar hit her mother, she manifests a light-based magic that she uses to strike down Gar. At her mother's advice, she flees the village. In her travels, Mia meets the enigmatic lizardlike Shulin, the slime-based Grodol warriors, a familiar baby dragon named Elanduru, and several Dungaga dissidents. It is revealed that the Dungaga are controlled by the three sons of the dark god Baphomet, who wish to summon him into the world. After defeating the three sons, Mia must rally the free people of the world and obtain the blessing of the five gods, in order to strike out into Baphomet's realm and defeat him. Gameplay The Lorian Forest, an early part of Eternal Daughter's game world The gameplay of Eternal Daughter is based on a classic video game style: side- scrolling platform action, but with added features such as secondary weapons and growth elements that are otherwise common in the genre of role-playing games. Items found throughout the game increase the strength of the player character's weapon, or the player's maximum number of health points. Also, as the game progresses, the player gains new abilities that can be used to explore areas of the game that were previously unreachable, progressively \\"unlocking\\" new locations within the game world. Because of this combination of gameplay elements, comparisons are often drawn to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid, popular console games that feature the same type of platform action combined with exploration-based adventure. These type of games are often called Metroidvania. Music A large part of the music was composed by Swedish video game composer David Saulesco. Like the game itself, the score uses a number of influences from famous video game soundtracks, most notably Final Fantasy VII. Eternal Daughter was Saulesco's first video game soundtrack, produced when he was 16 years old. The soundtrack was released on Saulesco's Bandcamp under the Creative Commons license CC by-nc-sa 3.0 on January 11, 2011.David Saulesco, Eternal Daughter Original Soundtrack (archived)eternal-daughter-original-soundtrack on opengameart.org Reception Home of the Underdogs praised Eternal Daughter for its well- designed and smoothly animated characters, precise platform engine, and addictive nonlinear gameplay. 1UP highlighted the game's unique visual style and level of polish, not usually seen in freeware games.

In June, bass guitarist Algy Ward replaced Bradshaw and the group issued a single, \\"This Perfect Day\\" in July, which peaked in the Top 40 on the UK Singles Chart. In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary and named \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" in its Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2007, 'I'm Stranded' was one of the first 20 songs added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Their debut album was listed at No. 20 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums, in October 2010. Background The Saints formed in Brisbane in 1973 with original members Chris Bailey (singer-songwriter, later guitarist), Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter), and Ivor Hay (drummer). In 1975, Kym Bradshaw joined on bass guitar. Contemporaneous with Ramones, the group were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and \\"buzz saw\\" guitar that characterised early punk rock. Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. According to Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane, they had developed their \\"own distinctive sound as defined by Kuepper's frenetic, whirlwind guitar style and Bailey's arrogant snarl\\". In June 1976, The Saints recorded two tracks, \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" and \\"No Time\\" with Mark Moffatt producing. Unable to find an interested label, they formed Fatal Records and independently released the two tracks as their debut single in September 1976. Their self-owned Eternal Promotions sent discs to radio stations and magazines both in Australia ‚Äì with little local interest ‚Äì and the United Kingdom. In the UK, a small label, Power Exchange, issued the single. Sounds magazine's reviewer Jonh Ingham declared it, \\"Single of this and every week\\". EMI head office in London contacted the Sydney branch and directed that they be signed to a three-album contract. Over two days in December, the group recorded their first LP album, (I'm) Stranded (21 February 1977), with Rod Coe producing. Kuepper said later that the album was \\"basically our live set and were also the oldest songs. And in particularly with 'Nights In Venice' and 'Messin' With The Kid', they were the first two songs we ever did.\\" It included a cover version of The Missing Links' track \\"Wild About You\\". On the single tracks \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" and \\"No Time\\", Kuepper's guitar was tuned up a semitone, to emulate Bo Diddley. The other eight tracks were recorded over a weekend in December 1976. Kuepper used Mark Moffatt's 1960 Fender Super amp with no effect pedals on (I'm) Stranded and No Time. On the remainder of the album he used a vocal PA as his guitar amp, after his live amp had \\"blown up\\", and an MXR Distortion Plus pedal. The band recorded the tracks live, though with the guitar amp in the corridor to avoid spill. The band supported AC/DC in late December 1976 and, early in 1977, relocated to Sydney. EMI re-issued the single \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" in February 1977 and it reached the Kent Music Report Top 100 Singles Chart. In May 1977, the band released their second single, \\"Erotic Neurotic\\" and then moved to the UK, where they differed with their label over how they should be marketed. EMI planned to promote them as a typical punk band, complete with ripped clothes and spiky hair ‚Äì The Saints insisted on maintaining a more downbeat image. In 2007, (I'm) Stranded was reissued as a CD with bonus tracks including the EP One Two Three Four and the single version of \\"This Perfect Day\\".

Hull in Creem December 1977, reviewing the US edition released on Sire, said the Saints \\"easily match the savage revolt of bands like the Clash and the Jam\\" and called (I'm Stranded) \\"a pistol shot of an album worth getting stewed over.\\" The Village Voice's Robert Christgau wrote, \\"intermittent hooks, droning feedback, shouted vocals, and oldie about incest, this album from Australia achieves the great mean of punk style\\". = Retrospective reviews = In his review of (I'm) Stranded, Jack Rabid of AllMusic declared that \\"[T]he Saints sparked the Far East punk rock movement with a blasting, blistering, scorching sound no one had heard before\\". Although eight of the tracks showed a \\"heavy, buzzing racket ... borders on unintelligible, they're so cheaply recorded\\". McFarlane described it as \\"full of rough, exhilarating rock'n'roll noise, and it remains one of the greatest debut albums of the era\\". John Ballon of MustHear writes the album is \\"a devastating listen, loaded with the same irresistible power ... [and] has all the intense purity of a band hell bent on making a racket, regardless of its commercial viability\\". Accolades In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary and named \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" in its Top 30 Australian songs of all time.

The RNA was organized in 1912 by a group of local collectors to attract the American Numismatic Association's annual convention to Rochester, New York, USA. They met with success as the ANA did hold their convention in Rochester. The RNA has met continuously since 1912. Only one local coin club, the Boston Numismatic Society, founded in 1860, has a longer record of continuous meetings. The RNA is located in Rochester, New York with a very active regional membership. Many members have retained their membership after leaving the area. Now, the RNA boasts a membership that reaches across the continental US. Each fall the RNA holds a regional coin show at the Rochester Museum and Science Center which attracts dealers and attendees from around Western New York. History The RNA was formed in January 1912 by Dr. George P. French with 32 charter members. The first meeting attracted 15 coin collectors. Dr. French collected other curiosities besides coins. His curios included the clothes worn by General Tom Thumb, one of the world's smallest men, and Peter the Great. One of the first acts of Dr. French was to have the RNA join the American Numismatic Association as Branch 2. The Chicago Numismatic Society had become ANA Branch 1 in 1904. At the first annual banquet in 1913, a two-inch bronze portrait medal was presented to Dr. French, the retiring president. This tradition has continued to this day. During World War II, plastic impressions were made from the dies and presented at the annual banquet. At the war's end, bronze pieces were struck from the original dies. Joseph A. Koeb, a charter member of the RNA, was the club's first member-sculptor. An artisan employed by Bastian Brothers of Rochester, he hand cut the dies in steel for the American Numismatic Association badge for the convention of 1912, held in Rochester, NY. As official club sculptor, he designed the reverses common to all medals from 1912 to 1952 and all the portraits of past presidents from 1912 to 1921. In 1921 Alphonse A. Kolb, another member-sculptor, began hand cutting the portrait dies. Alphonse A. Kolb designed many medals for both the ANA and the RNA. The Rochester Numismatic Association has hosted three ANA Conventions, in 1912 at the Hotel Rochester, in 1917 at the Memorial Art Gallery and in 1928 at the Seneca Hotel. An existing photograph of the 1912 convention shows the 47 people who attended and the number included only two women. Photos of the 1917 Convention show fewer people but many more women present. This is thought to reflect the social aspects of very early coin conventions. From the beginning the club has maintained both a collection and a circulating library. The curator often brings selections to meetings for display. Especially when the pieces complement the talk given that evening. In 1947, the RNA sponsored the Rochester Junior Numismatic Association under the leadership of Edward F. Meinhart, the 31st president of the senior group. Since then, the RJNA has met independently on a monthly basis. Many RJNA members continue on to join the RNA. Each spring the RNA sponsors a speaking contest named to honor Edward F. Meinhart. The contest is open to young numismatists and is intended to encourage the study and enjoyment of numismatics. Every participant is given a trophy and the winner is given a plaque. Presidential medals Each year the RNA honors the immediate past president with a medal and a banquet. This tradition started with the first RNA president, Dr. George P. French. The early medals were created by RNA members and accomplished artists Joseph A. Koeb and Alphonse Anton Kolb. Club memberships The RNA is a member organization of: * American Numismatic Association (Branch #2, and ANA Life Club #8), * American Numismatic Society, * Royal Canadian Numismatic Association, * Empire State Numismatic Association, * Token and Medal Society (TAMS), * Rochester Museum and Science Center (RMSC) See also * Exonumia * Numismatics * Coin collecting * Regular issue coinage * Coin grading External links * The Official Web Site of the Rochester Numismatic Association Category:Numismatic associations ","title":"Rochester Numismatic Association"},{"id":"3909180","text":"Control is a 2007 British biographical film about the life of Ian Curtis, singer of the late-1970s English post-punk band Joy Division. It is the first feature film directed by Anton Corbijn, who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer. The screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography Touching from a Distance by Curtis's widow Deborah, who served as a co- producer on the film. Tony Wilson, who released Joy Division's records through his Factory Records label, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation New Order. Control was filmed partly on location in Nottingham, Manchester, and Macclesfield, including areas where Curtis lived, and was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white. Its title comes from the Joy Division song \\"She's Lost Control\\", and that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain in control of his own life, and yet had no control over his epilepsy and pharmaceutical side effects. Sam Riley and Samantha Morton star as Ian and Deborah Curtis, and the film portrays the events of the couple's lives from 1973 to 1980, focusing on their marriage, the formation and career of Joy Division, Ian's struggle with epilepsy, and his extramarital affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor√©, culminating in his May 1980 suicide. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Honor√©, while James Anthony Pearson, Joe Anderson, and Harry Treadaway play Sumner, Hook, and Morris, respectively. The film also features Toby Kebbell as band manager Rob Gretton and Craig Parkinson as Tony Wilson. Control premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007 where it won several awards including the Director's Fortnight, the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film, the Regards Jeunes Prize for best first/second directed feature film, and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar. It went on to win five British Independent Film Awards including Best Film, Best Director for Corbijn, Most Promising Newcomer for Riley, and Best Supporting Actor for Kebbell. It was named Best Film at the 2007 Evening Standard British Film Awards, and Greenhalgh was given the Carl Foreman award for outstanding achievement in his first feature film at the 61st British Academy Film Awards.  Plot  Ian Curtis and Debbie Woodruff marry in 1975 in their home town of Macclesfield at ages 19 and 18, respectively. Ian retreats from domestic life, preferring to write poetry in solitude. On 4 June 1976 they attend a Sex Pistols concert with Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason, who are starting a band. Mesmerized by the concert, Ian volunteers to be their singer. They name themselves Warsaw, and Terry moves into a managerial role with the addition of drummer Stephen Morris. The band debuts 19 May 1977 and soon rename themselves Joy Division. Ian and Debbie finance their first EP, An Ideal for Living (1978). During his job as an employment agent, Ian witnesses his client Corinne Lewis suffering a seizure. Unsatisfied with the brief mention Joy Division receives from television host Tony Wilson, Ian demands that he put the band on his programme. In April 1978 Joy Division plays a battle of bands, impressing Tony and Rob Gretton, who becomes their new manager. They perform \\"Transmission\\" on Tony's programme and sign to his Factory Records label; Tony signs the contract using his own blood. In December 1978 Ian suffers a seizure on the way back from the band's first London gig; He is diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed medications that leave him drowsy and moody. Learning that Corinne Lewis has died of a seizure, he pens \\"She's Lost Control\\" about her. He begins to neglect Debbie, who gives birth to their daughter Natalie in April 1979. Ian quits his job to go on tour, leaving Debbie to work and care for the baby. Ian admits to Belgian journalist Annik Honor√© that he is miserable at home and considers his marriage a mistake. The two begin having an affair during Joy Division's January 1980 European tour. On returning home, Ian tells Debbie he is unsure if he still loves her. During the rehearsing of \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\", Rob informs the band that they will be departing 19 May for a tour of the United States. Debbie finds evidence of Ian's infidelity and confronts him. He promises that the affair is over, but continues to see Annik during the recording of Closer in Islington. Ian suffers a seizure mid-performance and is comforted by Annik, who admits she is falling in love with him. He attempts suicide by overdosing on phenobarbital but doctors save his life. He continues to perform, but is exhausted by the strain and overwhelmed by the audience's expectations. At a performance at the Derby Hall the stress proves too much and he is unable to go onstage. The audience riots when Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance steps in to cover for Ian, and the gig is ruined. Ian tells Tony that he believes everyone hates him and that it is his own fault. When Debbie learns that Ian is still seeing Annik, she demands a divorce. Bernard attempts to use hypnotherapy on Ian, who then goes to stay with his parents. He writes to Annik admitting his fear that his epilepsy will eventually kill him, and confesses that he loves her. On 17 May 1980, two nights before Joy Division is due to depart for America, Ian returns home and begs Debbie not to divorce him. When she refuses, he angrily orders her out of the house. After drinking alone and writing Debbie a letter, he has another seizure. Regaining consciousness the following morning, he hangs himself from the Sheila Maid in the kitchen. Debbie discovers his body and staggers into the street, crying for help. The news of Ian's death leaves the remaining Joy Division members stunned, while Tony consoles Annik. Ian's body is cremated. Cast * Sam Riley as Ian Curtis, the main figure in the film and the vocalist of Joy Division. Riley was relatively unknown before the film, and the director initially considered Cillian Murphy for the role, but later changed his mind because he viewed Murphy as \\"a little shorter than Ian\\". * Samantha Morton as Deborah Curtis, wife of Ian Curtis, whom she marries at a very young age but later in the film develops discord with her husband due to his affair with Annik. The film is based on Deborah's memoir on the experience with Ian Curtis and Joy Division. Though Morton dislikes biopics, she said Control was different in that she is a fan of Joy Division, and likes Deborah's book as well as Corbijn's photography. * Alexandra Maria Lara as Annik Honor√©, a journalist from Belgium and employee of the Belgian embassy. She has an affair with Ian Curtis after interviewing the band, exacerbating the tension between Ian and Deborah. * Joe Anderson as Peter Hook, the bass player of Joy Division. * Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton, the manager of the band, succeeding Terry Mason. Kebbell provides humour and a lighter angle to the film. * Craig Parkinson as Tony Wilson, the owner of the Factory Records company that distributes Joy Division's recordings. * James Anthony Pearson as Bernard Sumner, the band's guitarist and keyboardist. * Harry Treadaway as Stephen Morris, the drummer and percussionist of Joy Division. * Andrew Sheridan as Terry Mason, the manager of the band before the arrival of Rob Gretton. (However, he still stays tour manager) * Robert Shelly as Twinny, the roadie of the band. * Matthew McNulty as Nick Jackson, Ian's high school friend, his real name was Tony Nuttall, but he didn't give a permission to Anton Corbijn to use his name. * Ben Naylor as Martin Hannett, producer and co-founder of Factory Records with Tony Wilson. * John Cooper Clarke as himself, a British performance poet who composes punk style works. In the film he performed his poem \\"Evidently Chickentown\\" in a re-creation of a 1970s concert. * Lotti Closs as Gillian Gilbert, Stephen Morris' girlfriend. * Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer portrays a Public GP in a cameo. * Richard Bremmer as Kevin Curtis, Ian's father. Production Corbijn had been a devout Joy Division fan since the band's early days in the late 1970s. After moving to England, he befriended the band and shot several pictures for NME, which boosted his career as a photographer. Some of his pictures taken are featured in the film. He also directed the music video for the 1988 rerelease of \\"Atmosphere\\". He said that the film overlapped with his own life in some ways. \\"I had moved to England to be close to that music at the time, and I was very into Joy Division. I worked with them, took pictures of them that became synonymous with their music, and I was forever linked. Then eight years after [Ian Curtis'] death, I did the video for \\"Atmosphere.\\" So in other people's eyes I was always connected with them.\\" alt=A black and white view of a street with parked cars and terraced brick houses on both sides gently sloping downhill, revealing a view of a hillside with a large brick industrial building on it Control is Corbijn's debut as a film director, and he paid half of the ‚Ç¨4.5 million budget out of his own pocket. The film was shot on colour stock and printed to black and white to \\"reflect the atmosphere of Joy Division and the mood of the era\\". Todd Eckert and Orian Williams are the producers. Deborah Curtis, Ian Curtis' widow, is a co-producer, along with music mogul Tony Wilson, who died months before the film's release. It had been Wilson who had given Joy Division their TV break on the local magazine programme Granada Reports, and he also founded Factory Records, which released most of Joy Division's work. After the script for the film was finished in May 2005, the film was shot at the former Carlton studios in Nottingham, and on location in Nottingham, Manchester and Macclesfield, England, as well as other European venues. Filming began on 3 July 2006 and lasted for seven weeks. Filming in and around Barton Street (where Curtis lived and died), Macclesfield took place on 11 and 12 July 2006. EM Media, the Regional Screen Agency for the East Midlands, invested ¬£250,000 of European Regional Development Funds into the production of Control and supported the film throughout the shoot. Ian Curtis' daughter, Natalie, was in the crowd as an extra for the Derby Hall gig. The final scene of the film is shot in the exact position where Ian Curtis's memorial stone is located in Macclesfield with the camera panning out to reveal the crematorium which can be seen directly from his memorial. Release The Weinstein Company secured the rights to release the film in North America after its success at Cannes. The DVD was released in the UK on 11 February 2008, followed by the Australian DVD on 12 March 2008, and the North American DVD on 3 June 2008. =Box office= The film grossed $8.9 million worldwide. Reception Peter Bradshaw, the chief film reviewer for The Guardian, described Control as \\"the best film of the year: a tender, bleakly funny and superbly acted biopic of Curtis\\". Prominent American film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a three and a half stars rating, out of four, and wrote that \\"The extraordinary achievement of Control is that it works simultaneously as a musical biopic and the story of a life.\\" Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 88% approval rating with an average rating of 7.41/10 based on 112 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Control is a work of art, thanks to its evocative black and white cinematography and sensational performances from Sam Riley and Samantha Morton. Even those not familiar with Joy Division can still appreciate the beauty of the film.\\" Metacritic reports the film as having an average score of 78 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, claiming the film had \\"generally favourable reviews\\". However, some reviewers have disagreed and commented on the film negatively. Ray Bennett from Reuters remarked Control to be a \\"disappointment\\" and said the film \\"features lots of music from that time and has decent performances, but it fails to make the case for its fallen star\\". =Reaction from band members= Peter Hook and Stephen Morris, two of the founding members of Joy Division, generally praised the film. However, Morris has disputed its accuracy, saying \\"None of it's true really\\" but acknowledged the need to bend facts because \\"the truth is too boring.\\" Hook criticised the preview audience's reaction, saying how at the end of the film \\"it really hurt and everybody started clapping. It would've been nice to have a dignified silence.\\" Hook also remarked that \\"Control is a hell of a lot more accurate than 24 Hour Party People. You can tell that Anton knew us, and he knew us well and he took the original script, which was very English and quite subtly he made it deeper and have a broader appeal so that it would not just make sense to an English audience but to an international audience.\\"Morley, Paul (2008). Joy Division: Piece By Piece. London: Plexus Publishing Limited. 349-350. After viewing the film at Cannes, Hook said he \\"knew it was a great film and that it would be very well received because, even though it's two hours long, only two people went to the toilet the whole time. In fact, one of them was Bernard [Sumner]. The other one was a 70-year-old woman.\\" Soundtrack The Killers cover the 1979 Joy Division song \\"Shadowplay\\" on the soundtrack. However, all live Joy Division performances in the film are performed by the actors. The actors contribute a cover of an original Joy Division song (\\"Transmission\\") to the soundtrack. Incidental tracks by 1970s artists including David Bowie, Kraftwerk and Buzzcocks are the original recordings. New Order provided the original incidental music for the soundtrack. =Track listing= References External links * Controlthemovie.com - Official website * The official website in Canada  IONCINEMA.com interview with Anton for Control * A divided joy: seeing my father on film by Natalie Curtis, The Guardian, 30 September 2007 * Photos from the German premiere in Berlin on AEDT.de * Best of British: 2007 Evening Standard film awards, Judges' assessments Category:2007 biographical drama films Category:2007 films Category:BAFTA winners (films) Category:Biographical films about singers Category:British biographical drama films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:British rock music films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films about suicide Category:Films directed by Anton Corbijn Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films set in Manchester Category:Films shot in Cheshire Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester Category:Films shot in Nottinghamshire Category:Joy Division Category:Punk films Category:Cultural depictions of British men Category:Cultural depictions of rock musicians Category:2007 directorial debut films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Control (2007 film)"},{"id":"3909184","text":"'A' vs. Monkey Kong is the second album by the British alternative rock band A, released via Tycoon Recordings/London Records on 9 September 1999.

An oligarch, he made his wealth (estimated at $9.1 billion in February 2019) in the iron and steel industry, being the majority owner of Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works (MMK), one of the world's leading steel producers. He owns Ocean Victory, at the time of her construction the 10th largest yacht in the world.  Education  In 1974, Rashnikov earned a bachelor's degree in metal forming process at the Magnitogorsk Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. He later gained another degree in Organization of Production Administration, graduating from that program in 1994. Rashnikov received his doctorate in Technical Sciences in 1998. In addition to writing many research papers and scientific reports, he has implemented numerous engineering solutions. In 2002 he was elected to the position of Honored Professor at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. Additionally, he holds a role at the Russian Academy of Quality Problems as an Academician.  Career  Rashnikov first began his career with the Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works (MMK) in the company's repair shop as a fitter in 1967. Since then, up through 1991, Rashnikov advanced through a number of management positions at MMK, including that of Head of Production and Products Supply. In 1991, he was made Chief Engineer and First Deputy General Director for the firm. In 1997, Viktor Rashnikov succeeded in rising to the role of General Director at MMK, before finally becoming in 2005 its Chairman of the Board.  Leadership at MMK  Having worked his way up through various positions at MMK, Viktor Rashnikov was able in the 90's to attain near complete control of the company through the purchase of shares on the market (87.26% as of May 2017). The results of Rashnikov's leadership at MMK are described by some as \\"impressive\\", > \\"By 2007, 10 years after Mr. Rashnikov became director, MMK doubled steel > production from 6m to 12m tonnes a year.\\" > \\"Steel king with magnetic effect\\", Financial Times, 2008. It was under Rashnikov's tenure as Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2007 that MMK became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange. He implemented a full-scale investment program including modernization of five blast furnaces, construction of an oxygen unit, construction of electric arc furnace facilities, construction of thick-plate Mill 5000 and the cold-rolling Mill 2000 complex. In 2000-2016, total investments of the company amounted to $13 billion, including about $10 billion in MMK's development. The company in 2016 produced 70% of metal requirements at AvtoVAZ, 50% at GAZ and 50% at KAMAZ. The company fully met Russian Ford‚Äôs metal requirements.  Philanthropic activities  Viktor Rashnikov annually allocates about $25 million to the company's social and charitable pursuits, including: Viktor Rashnikov helped to fund the construction of the Holy Ascension Cathedral in Magnitogorsk \\\\- Provision of healthcare for pensioners, including the organisation of relaxation and spa treatments. Veterans and invalids receive free treatment and operations. \\\\- A new programme, Support For Large Families, has helped 235 families with three or more children under the age of 18. \\\\- Assistance to victims of natural, environmental, industrial and other disasters. \\\\- Assistance in educational, scientific and artistic projects. \\\\- Rashnikov helped to fund the Holy Ascension Cathedral in Magnitogorsk ‚Äì the main cathedral of the Magnitogorsk diocese, located in the city of Magnitogorsk. He also built sophisticated medical facilities and two ski resorts in the nearby Urals. Due to MMK's environmental activities, total emissions had been reduced by 37.5% and the specific emissions by 47.4%. In 2011-2016, environmental spending of the company averaged 3.5-4 billion rubles per year. The company recently adopted a long-term environmental program through 2025, with funding of more than $600 million. Rashnikov's contribution to social development of Magnitogorsk is recognized by the Russian government. In 2009, the then Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin praised Rashnikov for his management. > \\"Mr. Rashnikov is a good manager and not only because the company is > developing and new technologies are being introduced, but also because a lot > is being done to care for the people and to look after the environment. You > know better than I do what winters used to be like in Magnitogorsk. > Everything was black, including snow. Today, the situation is radically > different. Perhaps, not all problems have been solved, but emissions to the > atmosphere have changed cardinally and for the better. You are also adopting > new technologies and opening new production setups.\\" > Special TV programme \\"Conversation with Vladimir Putin: To Be Continued\\", > December 3, 2009  Metallurg Magnitogorsk  Rashnikov is the owner and the president of Metallurg Magnitogorsk ice hockey team. Since he took over in 1993, the team worked up a reputation as one of the top Russian teams of the new era.

Hate Studies responds to a call to gather the wisdom from academic fields throughout the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, and other areas, and to bring it into conversation and practical application in law and policy, civil society organizations, and elsewhere. As a working definition, Hate Studies inquires into the human capacity to \\"define, and then demonize or dehumanize an 'other,' and the processes that inform and give expression to, or can curtail, control, or combat, that capacity.\\" (Stern, 2004). Hate Studies seeks to understand and appropriately address the multifaceted phenomena and factors of hatred, which occur at individual, collective, institutional, and societal levels, by cross-pollinating and integrating all disciplines that have something valuable to say about hatred and pulling them together into a larger academic enterprise. The vision and momentum for Hate Studies grew out of efforts initiated and hosted by the Gonzaga University Institute for Hate Studies, which was founded in 1997. Gonzaga University, a Jesuit Catholic institution located in Spokane, Washington (USA), hosted the \\"First International Conference to Establish the Field of Hate Studies\\" in March 2004. The Gonzaga Institute for Hate Studies was the world's first academic unit devoted to this emerging field, and today the Gonzaga Institute organizes the International Conference on Hate Studies and publishes the peer-review scholarly Journal of Hate Studies. It has hosted three \\"International Conferences on Hate Studies\\" (2004, 2011, 2013), and has also published 10 annual volumes of the Journal of Hate Studies; Volumes 11 and 12 are due for publication in 2014-15. In addition, the Gonzaga Institute hosts speaker series, visiting fellows, and special academic events in cities worldwide; supports research and courses on hate and directly related social problems; and serves as a nexus hub for this growing field. As of 2013, there is an \\"International Network for Hate Studies,\\" which is based in the European Union and boasts significant participation within the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth Countries, and other nations and regions. The Network members primarily focus on hate crime and related issues of hate and victimization in multicultural societies. The Network hosted its inaugural conference in May 2014, at the University of Sussex School of Law. Also in 2014, the University of Leicester launched a brand-new \\"Centre for Hate Studies,\\" which grew out of the \\"Leicester Hate Crime Project,\\" and Palgrave Macmillan announced the \\"Palgrave Hate Studies Series\\".

The club is a 1984 merger of BK Derby and IF Saab.https://www.svenskalag.se/bkderby/sida/19194/historik And as both these clubs had a one-season spell each in Allsvenskan during the 1970s (Derby in 1977, Saab in 1973), the new club was initially very hopeful for a promotion from their Division 3 position. At this time Division 2 was split up into a Southern and a Northern league, with 14 teams each, but the third division was split up into 12 regional leagues with 12 teams each. The difference between the second and third tier was huge.  1985 qualification for Division 2  In 1985 Link√∂ping won their regional league, but as only half of the twelve regional winners were to be promoted, a home-away qualifying was needed. In the lottery Link√∂ping drew Landskrona BoIS. Of the 11 possible opponents, it was the largest and club with most traditions. This was not the same[?] as Landskrona was favorite. Only a little above 3000 spectators came to the first qualifier, home at Folkungavallen, and perhaps half of them were Landskrona BoIS supporters. An exciting match ended 1-1, but \\"BoIS\\"'s goalkeeper Peter Joelsson saved. In the return at Landskrona IP twice as many attendees turned up (6016). Almost everyone hoped that this decider would go to Landskrona BoIS. So it did, but once again the match ended 1-1, with no goals scored in the 2 x 15 min extra time. So the final decider became a penalty shootout and five penalties each wasn't sufficient.

Nottingham Tramways Company 1872-1875  Plans for tramways in the town of Nottingham started at least as early as 1870 and sufficient progress was made by several prominent business men to formally establish the Nottingham Tramways Company in 1872. The Corporation Highways Committee reported on 8 January 1872 that the Nottingham Tramways Company Limited has asked for consent to an application to the Board of Trade for a provisional order authorising them to construct tramways to Arnold, Beeston, Bulwell and Carlton. No plans for this proposed network survive in the local archives in Nottingham. In November 1872 the company issued notice that they intended to submit a Bill to Parliament for the operation of tramways in Nottingham. The proposed network made no mention of Arnold or Beeston but comprised a line from a terminus on Forest Rd at its junction with Mount Hooton Rd, east along Forest Rd, then Mansfield Rd, Melbourne St, Milton St, Upper Parliament St, Market St, Wheeler Gate, Albert St, and then Carrington St to the junction with Station St. From this junction one line would run along Station St and across London Rd into the forecourt of the Great Northern Railway station and another along Arkwright St to Trent Bridge. At the same time the company also issued notice that they intended to submit an application to the Board of Trade for a much larger network . These included lines to run along Mansfield Rd to its junction with Broadmere Lane, along Chapel Bar, Derby Rd, Alfreton Rd, Hyson Green Rd, Radford Rd, David Lane and a terminus in Mill St; on Derby Rd to the intersection with the railway crossing at Lenton Station; along Woodborough Rd, Alfred St and Carlton Rd to a terminus at the junction with Oldham St; the whole length of Forest Rd, Basford Rd, Elm Avenue and a terminus in High Church St. The submission to the Nottingham Corporation was successful, and the plans were approved on 7 November 1872 , but it seems that the application to the Board of Trade failed. In November 1873, the company submitted revised proposals to the Board of Trade for the lines running south of St. Peter's Church. These revisions downgraded the proposals and included single line working for Station St and Arkwright St. The line in Station St was proposed to terminate just before the junction with London Rd, rather than cross it to enter the forecourt of the Great Northern Railway station. The records of the Corporation reveal that at a meeting on 2 February 1874 > the Council consent to the Nottingham Tramways order 1874 becoming law\\". > Town Clerk reports that previous application of the company failed; this is > a much restricted one, dealing with two lines only: (1) from St Peter's > Square along Carrington Street to the east end of Station St. (2) from the > junction of Station Street and Carrington Street along Arkwright Street to > the Union Inn on London Road. (1) is a partly double line, partly single. > (2) is single only. Clauses are included in the order for workmen's fares > (2d instead of 3d) before 7am and after 5.30pm Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited 1875-1897 Map of the routes and depots as finally developed In 1875, the company name was changed to the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited. This was before the Enclosure Act of 1877 when the town extended its boundary to encompass Basford, Radford, Sneinton and Lenton. Again it seems that there were problems, for in November 1876 the company came up with a further proposal. This proposal comprised the following lines #Long Row then Market Street, Upper Parliament Street, Milton Street, Melbourne Street and Mansfield Road, terminating opposite the south east corner of St. John's Church, Carrington. 1 mile 6 furlongs 5.7 chains (3,205 yards). #From a junction with tramway 1 in the Market Place at the corner of Market Street, then along Angel-row, Chapel Bar, Tollhouse Hill, Derby Road, Alfreton Road, Hyson Green Road and Radford Road, terminating on Radford Road at the junction with Wood Street. 2 miles 2 furlongs 8.7 chains (4,151 yards). #The length of Forest Road connecting tramways 1 and 2. 6 furlongs 1.76 chains (1,359 yards). #St. Peter's Square, Albert Street, Lister Gate, and Carrington Street to the east end of Station Street. 5 furlongs 1.85 chains (1,141 yards). #From a junction with tramway 4 at the junction of Station Street and Carrington Street along Arkwright Street to the Union Inn on London Rd. 5 furlongs 8 chains (1,276 yards). The plans make no reference to locations of the depots, nor crossings or passing places. Rather vaguely, the wording of the application for a provisional order states: > The Provisional Order will also empower the promoters from time to time to > make such crossings, passing-places, siding, junctions, curves, turnouts, > and other works, in addition to those particularly specified in this notice > as may be necessary or convenient to the efficient working of the proposed > tramways, or any of them, or for providing access to any stables or > carriage-houses or works of the promoters, and will empower the promoters to > use carriages on the proposed tramways to be moved by animal or any other > locomotive power. . .Nottingham Archives Office PR3820 The total length of the routes outlined in the plansNottingham Archives Office PR3820 and confirmed in the Tramways Orders Confirmation Act 1877Tramways Orders Confirmation Act 1877 is 6.325 miles (11,132 yards) or 6 miles 2 furlongs and 6 chains (some double track, some single). The report presented to the third annual general meeting of the shareholders in 1880, shows that the company purchased approximately 10 miles 6 furlongs and 4 chains of rail. Some of this rail would have been necessary for the depots and connections into the depots, and some kept for repairs and renewals. In 1877 the Board of Trade made a Provisional Order, known as the Nottingham and District Tramways Order, and Royal Assent was received on 23 July 1877. The company was authorised to operate animal-drawn trams only, in the borough of Nottingham and also in the districts of Lenton, Basford and Radford. These districts were not included in the Borough of Nottingham until the Extension Act of 1877. The Tramways Orders Confirmation Act of 1877Tramways Orders Confirmation Act 1877 also specified the minimum levels of service that the company was required to operate: to run carriages each way every morning in the week and every evening in the week (Sundays, Christmas Day and Good Friday always excepted), at such house, not being later than seven in the morning or earlier than six in the evening respectively. The track was of the Winby and Levick system and consisted of flat-bottomed, grooved tramway-type rails laid longitudinally on broad iron plates, which in turn rested on consolidated macadam or other road material; this was believed to make up a sufficient foundation without concrete. Nottingham was the first installation of this newly patented system. The base plates were 12 inches wide and inch thick in lengths 11 feet 11 inches long, and were laid continuously in order to avoid the plate joints and the rail joints coming together, as the rails were in lengths. [The rail length figure reported in the Nottingham Evening Post is 27 ft.] The base plate length of 11 ft 11 inches and track length of would allow a run of nearly two miles of track before the plate joints and the rail joints came together] The cost of laying the track was ¬£1,974 (), a mile and the contract for laying the rails was placed with Ridley and Company. The paving works cost ¬£2,559 (), per mile and this was undertaken by the Nottingham Corporation. =The Southern Route= On Wednesday 11 September 1878 the tramway company performed a test run: > Yesterday the Nottingham Tramways Company made an experiment for running the > No. 1 car for the inspection of the directors prior to the opening for the > public, which event will in all probability take place on Saturday next. At > ten o'clock in the morning the car was \\"in waiting\\" near the Walter > Fountain, and being a novelty in Nottingham, and splendidly fitted up also, > a crowd of interested spectators soon gathered around for minute inspection. > Under the impression that the car was being opened to the public, many > persons jumped inside, though, to their disappointment, they were politely > requested to retire until Saturday next. > At about 10.30 Mr. Alderman Gilpin, chairman of the company, and several > other directors made their appearance, and a few minutes later the car, > drawn by a couple of powerful horses, went sliding along Carrington-street > to the Midland and nearly to the Great Northern Railway Stations. Pleased > with the sight, the people ran by the side of the car and not a few hailed > the conductor to stop and take them up. Having returned to the end of > Station-street, the car was run along Arkwright-street to the Trent Bridge. > Considering that the metals are new and not so clean as they will be kept in > a few days, the car went along very pleasantly indeed. > The whole of the road which is now completed, and which is known as the No. > 1 Section, is about a mile and a half in length. The other day, the > Government inspector, Colonel Majendi, went over the line, and having > pronounced it to be satisfactory, a certificate is expected to arrive in a > day or two As this is the district from which most of the traffic is > expected to come, cars, capable of carrying out-side as well as inside > passengers will in all probability be used in the future, though at present > the eight vehicles provided are for inside passengers only. The line is > double all the way, and the traffic which is expected will render the > running practically continuous. The fare will be twopence all the way. > In Carrington-street and Station-street the road is sufficiently wide to > allow ordinary vehicle traffic on either side of the trams, though in > Arkwright-street the aspect of the road shows pretty clearly that some > difficulty will arise. If a cab is drawn at the side of the road one of the > wheels must be drawn at the least a foot upon the footway, otherwise a > collision will be inevitable. The same difficulty applies to both side of > the way, and as traffic is great in Arkwright-street, the double line will > be rather awkward unless the foot-way is reduced. > The depot of the company, which is a newly-erected building off Arkwright- > street, is complete to the detail, the stables being capable of > accommodating 50 or 60 horses. The rooms are lofty and well ventilated, and > certainly the core of horses which we saw yesterday were well worth of the > home which they now realise. A finer set of cattle it is scarcely possible > to conceive, and cannot fail to win the admiration of the people.Nottingham > Journal 12 September 1878 The tramway was formally opened on 17 September 1878 (although services for the public were delayed for a day awaiting the arrival of the certificate from the Board of Trade). At 3:00pm three cars, decorated with flags, made an inaugural run from St Peter‚Äôs church to Trent Bridge. They carried the Company Chairman, Alderman Gilpin, the Company Manager, Mr Gideon Herbert, the Mayor of Nottingham, Sir James Oldknow, Saul Isaac, M.P., the Vicar of St. Mary's, Canon Francis Morse and other invited guests. The progress of the party was watched with lively interest by some thousands of spectators assembled along the whole route, particularly in St. Peter's Square. The route taken was from outside the company offices in St Peter‚Äôs Square along Albert Street, Lister Gate, Carrington Street and the Station Street terminus, where the party turned round and came back along Station Street to Muskham Street via Arkwright Street, to inspect the Muskham Street Depot and stables. Afterwards they continued to Trent Bridge for a banquet in the Town Arms Inn at the southern terminus of the line. Toasts were made and speeches given, and in this extract the chairman revealed a taste of things to come, and attempted to allay some fears of other road users: > The rails themselves [are] 27 feet in length, and these form one continuous > bearing. It had been subjected to a strain of 50 tons weight, without > showing any appreciable depression, and therefore, when the Government > allowed them to use steam locomotives in the streets, they could freely > place them upon these rails without their exhibiting any serious sinking. He > was more free to speak of the advantages of the rails because they had > decided to use them throughout the whole of their system. The wrought iron > flange which lay at the bottom of the rail, and upon which the rails rested, > had also sets laid upon it, so that the granite sets next the rail could not > sink unless the rail sank with them. The objections in other towns had been > that in any place where there was heavy traffic, as carriages and carts > passing along, as it was technically called, \\"skidded\\" along the side of the > rails. It was quite likely, therefore, that springs and wheels should be > broken under such circumstances, but with the present style of rail no > apprehensions need be experienced as to them. > [The Company] intended immediately to commence with Mansfield Road section . > . . to Carrington Church, near which they had purchased land for stables and > other premises such as they had seen that day, then along Forest Road to the > end of Berners Street and then from Market Street up Derby Road to Basford. > Shortly after this the party broke up, one portion returning to the centre > of the town by the tramway. . . Those who returned to the town in the first > car reached St. Peter's-square in the fair time of nine minutes.Nottingham > Evening Post 18 September 1878 Eight single deck cars had been purchased from the Starbuck Car and Wagon Company of Birkenhead, to service the routes. The depot and stables was situated on Muskham St where the Portland swimming baths now stands. The tramway was an immediate success, opening to the public at noon on 18 September. In the first 3¬Ω days, 12,004 passengers were carried with ticket revenue of just over ¬£100 (),. =The Carrington route= Horse tram on Long Row The construction of the second line began almost immediately after the opening of the first. A formal ceremony took place on 23 September 1878 when Miss Bella Winby, the daughter of the patentee of the track system proceeded to raise the first stone with a miniature pick prepared specially for the occasion. The spot selected for this ceremony was in the centre of the road a small distance above St. John's Church, Carrington and exactly opposite the plot of land purchased by the company for the depot and stables. Work moved quickly and on 3 April the works were inspected by the Board of Trade and authorised for opening on Saturday 5 April 1879. The route was via Long Row, Market Street, Parliament Street, Milton Street and Mansfield Road, with a branch along Forest Road. The Carrington route was not connected to the southern route, and it had its own depot and stables between St John‚Äôs Church and Watcombe Road. This site was subsequently redeveloped into The Carrington Lido open-air swimming pool (1937‚Äì1988), then into a children's playground and, later still, redeveloped into a residential retirement development. The inspection and opening ceremony was reported in the local press > Yesterday (Thursday) morning Major-General Hutchinson of the Board of Trade, > made an official inspection of the second section of the Nottingham Tramway > Company's line, which extends from the Market-place as far as Carrington and > the end of Forest-Road, and which is now fully completed. . . We are > authorised to state that General Hutchinson expressed himself fully > satisfied with the line, and consented to its being opened for traffic on > Saturday next, the requisite certificate of the Board of Trade to be > forwarded in due course.Nottingham Journal on 4 April 1879 The company ran two services, firstly from the Market Place to Carrington and secondly from the Market Place to Forest Road as far as the junction with Burns St. The track extended further along Forest Road right to the end to connect to the Basford line now under construction, but this section was not used for passenger carrying services. The Forest Road residents were quite wealthy and this provided the company with its most profitable services. The other routes suffered slightly from having peak loadings (i.e. carrying workmen at the start and the end of the day) but less traffic during the day. The Forest Road residents provided a steady demand for services throughout the day. However, they also had complaint with the running of services on a Sunday and submitted a memorandum to the Council a few months after the services started \\"praying that the running of trams on Sundays along Forest Road be discontinued\\". For these routes Messrs Stevenson and Company of New York supplied three double deck and one single deck cars, and in 1880 Starbucks constructed five more single deck tram cars, similar to those originally supplied. =The Basford route= The Depot Buildings, on Isandula Road, now used as a factory The third and final line to Basford was opened on 11 August 1879 Nottingham Journal 12 August 1879 and this ran from the Market Place to Basford Gas Works on Church Street, via Chapel Bar, Derby Road, Alfreton Road (with a connection to the Forest Road line), Bentick Road and Radford Road. The depot and stables for this route was built on Isandula Road, very near the Basford terminus, to designs by the Nottingham architect, Albert Nelson Bromley.Nottingham: an illustrated history. J. V. Beckett, Ken Brand The average working week of the horse-tram crews and depot men was at first anything between 80 and 90 hours, and a 16-hour term of duty in a single day was commonplace. Conductors received 16/- per week when working and 1/- per day when not working. Occasionally the company was required to arrange special trams. One such example occurred on 25 May 1881 when the Water Committee invited the members of the Corporation to inspect \\"the works of the important water undertaking recently acquired by the town\\". From the public offices in Albert Street the large party left by private trams for Trent Bridge. As the day progressed so the party moved on to and around the various sites. From the Trent works they travelled by tram again and then walked to the Castle Works. From there the Park Row reservoir was visited and another short walk took them to the Sion Hill [Canning Circus] Works. From the top of the Derby Rd, nearby, the tram cars were used for the journey to the Scotholme Springs. The party then moved on by carriage to see Bestwood Pumping Station. Starbucks provided five single deck cars for the Basford service. By December 1879 the company had twenty cars running on the three sections, employing 192 horses, and the average number of passengers was from 50,000 to 60,000 each week.Nottingham Date Book 11 August 1879 With the steep gradient of 1 in 17 up Chapel Bar and Derby Rd, two additional horses were required to haul the cars. These trace- horses, or cock-horses as they were called, were put on at the bottom of Market St, and taken off at Canning Circus. A report of the Market and Fairs committee was presented to the Corporation on 1 March 1880 as follows: > We have agreed to allow two horses which are required to work the tram cars > on the heavy gradients of Market St and Derby Rd, to stand in the Market > Place under a suitable covering provided by the Tramways Company, on payment > of such weekly amount as would by payable for stalls occupying the same > space. The cock horse enclosure came into service on 11 March 1880. The company erected a temporary shed. This led to a dispute with the council and on 7 March 1881 the Annual Report of the Markets and Fairs Committee was presented to the Corporation and states that the shed for horses of the Tramway Company in the Market Place has . . . been removed at the request of the Council. Later photographs suggest that it consisted of four posts, with a single rope on three sides, the fourth side being open towards the tram lines, but in the winter it is likely that the space was covered by a tarpaulin to offer the horses some brief shelter between duties. It is said that the horses became so used to their task of assisting the trams up Market St, that when released at the top of the hills they often came back on their own, leaving the horse boys behind. The tram fare up Derby Rd was 2d, but coming down it was 1d. The journey from the Market place to Basford took one hour ten minutes and to extend the service to Bulwell, the company provided its own horse buses to transport passengers from the Basford tram terminus. It has been suggested that a cock horse was also required to assist on the inward journey from Hyson Green up Alfreton Rd to Raleigh St, although no records have been found to indicate where the horses were kept. Designation of routes was by a lettered destination board on each side of the car above the windows, and the cars were painted various colours denoting the routes on which they worked. The Trent Bridge and Station St services were all over yellow, the Carrington and Forest Rd services were white and red and the Basford service was white and dark blue. Although a service to Bulwell via Alfreton Rd and Cinderhill was considered, no further extension to the route was made, nor were any new routes commissioned, but additional vehicles were purchased to add to the fleet or to replace existing vehicles which were scrapped. A local correspondent, Percy Vere, wrote an article in 1879 to the Nottingham Journal Nottingham Journal 26 June 1879 during the construction of the tramways entitled On Local Locomotion, an extract from which is included here, as it gives some statistics and comparisons: > It was said that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there > was this, that, and the other special reason why it would be all moonshine > in Nottingham.

However, the company was involved in some accidents, some fatal, as this report from the Nottingham Journal on 1 September 1879Nottingham Journal 1 September 1879 shows: > On Saturday (30 August) a sad accident happened in Station Street. It seems > that a porter or carriage driver named Walter Shepherd employed at the > Midland Railway Station was trying to cross the road in the above named > street when in endeavouring to get out of the way of a horse which was > coming along and a tramcar was passing at the same time [sic]. He was > knocked down and so dreadfully crushed by the wheels that he died sometime > after at the General Hospital. The deceased was about 36 years of age, > married and leaves a family. At the inquest the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. On 7 May 1880Nottingham Journal 7 May 1880 a case was heard before the Nottingham Magistrates' Court where James Crabbe a tram driver was charged with offences from 4 May of using abusive language to the police and with running his tramcar into the Yeomanry. The officer reported that his was on duty at the junction of Clumber Street and Parliament Street when the defendant came along driving his tram, and persisted in pushing his way into the Cavalry. The officer tried to stop him but he refused and the pole of the tram car ran into the horses, though it did no injury. The officer reported that the defendant used bad language and told the officer to go somewhere. James Crabbe was found guilty and the bench imposed a fine of 40s. On 4 July 1880Nottingham Journal 4 July 1880 five conductors were charged with allowing overcrowding of their tramcars and after an appearance by Herbert Gideon, the Manager and Secretary of the company promising that this would not happen again, they were fined 10s each. The Basford route was the scene of a fatal accident on 3 August 1880. Two young girls were crossing Alfreton Road. A bleach van approached and they tried to avoid it, one of them ran in front of a passing tram car and was knocked down by the horses. A wheel passed over her neck and she was killed on the spot. At an inquest the coroner exonerated the company and recorded a verdict of accidental death. On 30 August 1880Nottingham Journal 30 August 1880 a Midland Railway dray horse ran away down Low Pavement and collided with a tramcar. The dray horse charged between the tramcar and the tramcar horses and the tramcar was thrown off the line. The driver and single passenger who were standing on the front of the tram had a lucky escape. A recurring problem was the inability of the tramcars to avoid obstructions. On 28 July 1883 a hansom cab driver, Mark Thompson, was summoned to court for obstructing the progress of a tramcar. He was sitting in his hansom on Albert Street waiting for a fare when the tramcar approached. He refused to move over to allow the tramcar to pass and a large crowd gathered which completely blocked the street. He was fined 10s. Josiah Dann, a tramcar conductor, was summoned on 2 August 1883 for having carried 28 passengers when the car was only licensed for 24. The officer noticed the tramcar in Carrington Street drawn by one horse and counted the passengers. When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop and some of the passengers got out. The conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers were all going to the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s. Sometimes the intense competition between omnibus and tramcar company got out of hand as this report from the Nottingham Journal of 9 August 1883Nottingham Journal 9 August 1883 reveals: > William Kirk, driver of the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned > for using abusive and threatening language to Israel Jordan, driver of the > Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the > complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was > another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all > the streets in the town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in > which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being on > the wrong side of the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day Mr. > Jordan was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language > to him, and said \\"You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before > the week is out. The first time I meet you I'll knock you and the bus off > the road.\\" Defendant also threatened to give complainant a \\"good hiding\\". > Israel Jordan was then called, and said he was one of the proprietors of the > Nottingham and Bulwell Bus. He corroborated the statement of Mr. Stevenson. > In reply to Mr. Barlow, he denied that he first used threatening language > towards complainant. Frederick Bramley, residing at Hucknall Torkard also > corroborated.-- There was a cross summons taken out by Kirk against Jordan > for abusive language, and obstructing the steam car. The charge of using > abusive language was withdrawn, but the other was proceeded with and Kirk > was placed in the witness box. After hearing his evidence, however, the > Bench dismissed the summons against Jordan, and fined Kirk 10s. The also > expressed a hope that a better feeling would be established between tramcar > drivers and conductors and the drivers of other vehicles. =The Steam Tram= Nottingham Steam Tram circa 1882 In 1880 the company made some trials with a steam tram from Messrs Hughes and Co of Loughborough. On 27 May, at six in the morning, the engine was brought to the top of Sion Hill outside the general cemetery where a number of invited guests boarded. The tram proceeded down the steep hill on Derby Road and Chapel Bar to the terminus next to the Exchange. Then the car left the Market Place and made the reverse journey back up the Derby Road hill, stopping to prove that it could start on a steep hill. The tram then proceeded to the Basford Depot and when the flat ground of Radford Road was reached the driver was instructed to increase the speed, and 20 m.p.h. was achieved. The tram reached the Basford Depot in approximately 20 minutes and the trial was judged a success. A further experiment was undertaken on 3 June, to which civic dignitaries including the Mayor, the Town Clerk and various Aldermen were invited, some of whom followed the trial from horse-drawn tram cars. The emission of steam in the Market Place was explained by the manufacturer, Mr. Hughes as he had been requested by the authorities to discharge the condensing water outside of the town, so under normal operating conditions, steam would be prevented from escaping in the town. Dublin and Lucan Steam Tramway In 1880 Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. built a steam tram at their Bloomsgrove Works in Norton St that was tested on the Nottingham tracks. It was sold to the Dublin and Lucan Steam Tramway Company, for ¬£950 (),, in 1881. It is reported to have covered its two-mile (3 km) run in ten minutes. This Manlove Alliott design was a self-propelled steam vehicle having a vertical boiler on each end platform with the engine mounted below the saloon floor. The upper deck had knife-board seats, back to back, with a top canopy and open sides and ends, with modesty rails. The boiler chimneys ran up and through the roof, at each end, serving coke boilers 25¬Ω inches in diameter and high. The two-cylinder steam engine had a piston bore of 7¬Ω inches and a stroke of 9 inches. Unladen it weighed 9 tons and was capable of carrying 50 passengers. The General Works and Highways Committee granted approval on 2 January 1881 for a one-week trial using steam power on the Mansfield Road route. On 9 January 1882 the General Works and Highways Committee reported to the Corporation an application of the Tramways Company \\"for permission to use steam power for a period of one year on Basford, Carrington and Forest routes using Parrott's patent combined engine and car, manufactured by Manlove, Alliott and Fryer of Nottingham, and Dickenson's combined engine and car, manufactured in Sheffield.\\"Minutes of the General Works and Highways Committee to Nottingham Corporation. 9 January 1882 This was agreed on quite remarkable conditions, including \\"that no steam or smoke be discharged and that the action of the engine shall be noiseless\\". However, the introduction of steam power required Board of Trade approval and the order appears to have not been carried out. The company may have run trials with these two engines but there is no evidence that either was put into passenger carrying service. Eleven months later on 4 December 1882Nottingham Journal 5 December 1882 the General Works and Highways Committee reported that \\"the Tramways Company were authorised by the Board of Trade to use a steam tram on the Basford route for one year. The following conditions applied: :The Board of Trade under the powers conferred upon them by the Tramways Orders Confirmation Act 1879,Tramways Orders Confirmation Act 1879 do by this license authorise as an experiment only, the use of steam power in addition to, or in substitution of, animal power by the Nottingham and Districts Tramways Company, Limited, (hereinafter called \\"the Company\\") on Tramways No. 2 authorised by the Nottingham and Districts Tramways Order 1877, which was confirmed by the Tramways Order Confirmation Act 1879 (hereinafter called \\"the tramways\\") extending from the Market-place in Nottingham to the terminus is Basford, for a period not exceeding one year from the date hereof, subject to the following requirements, regulations and conditions, that is to say :- :REQUIREMENTS :The engine to be used on the tramways shall be an engine built by W. Wilkinson and Company of Wigan, Lancashire, and designated by a plate affixed thereto as No. 1, if so long as it complies with the following requirements, that is to say:- :(a) The engine shall be fitted with an efficient brake, and a governor shall be attached to the engine, so arranged that at any time when the engine exceeds a speed of eight miles an hour it shall cause the steam to be shut off and the brakes applied. :(b) The number shall be shown in a conspicuous part thereof. :(c) It shall be fitted with an indicator by means of which the speed shall be shown, with a suitable fender to push aside obstructions, and with a special bell to be sounded as a warning when necessary :(d) Arrangement shall be made enabling the driver to command the fullest possible view of the road before him. :(e) It shall be free from noise produced by blast or clatter of machinery: the machinery shall be concealed from view at all points above four inches from the level of the rails, and all fire used on the engine shall be concealed from view. :Every carriage used on the tramways shall be so constructed as to provide for the safety of passengers, and for their safe entrance to, exit from, and accommodation in, such carriage, and for their protection from the machinery of the engine used for drawing or propelling such carriage. :REGULATIONS :1. The speed at which the engine and carriages shall be driven or propelled along the tramways shall not exceed the rate of six miles an hour, and the speed at which such engine shall pass through facing points, whether fixed or movable, shall not exceed the rate of four miles an hour. :2. The special bell shall be sounded by the driver of the engine from time to time when it is necessary as a warning. :3. No steam or smoke shall be emitted from the engine, and no hot air shall issue in a way to annoy passengers. :4. Whenever it is necessary to prevent impending danger the engine shall be brought to a stand-still. :5. The entrance to and exit from the carriages shall be by the endermost or conductor's platform. :6. Before commencing to descend the incline in Derby- road and the curve in Bentinck-road, the engine shall on each occasion be brought to a stand-still and the speed in descending the same shall not exceed four miles an hour. :7. The Company shall place, and keep placed, in a conspicuous position inside of each carriage in use on the tramways, a printed copy of these requirements, regulations and conditions. :8. For any breach of any of the above requirements or regulations the Company shall for each offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. :CONDITIONS :The Board of Trade and their officers may from time to time, and shall on the application of the local authority of any of the districts through which the tramways pass, inspect the engine or carriages used on the tramways, and the machinery therein; and may whenever they think fit prohibit the use on the tramways of any of them which in their opinion are not safe for use. :Signed by order of the Board of Trade, this twenty-fifth day of November, 1882. Henry G. Calcraft (Asst. Secretary) In addition to these conditions the letter from the Board of Trade to the Town Council added that the licence was issued on the distinct understanding that the engine shall not be used on the short length at the Basford end of the line, until the tramway has been placed in the centre of the road and means provided for the engine getting round its car. This trial appears to have been successful because company sought an extension to the one year licence, and this was confirmed in The Nottingham Tramways Order of 2 April 1884 - the \\"Order authorising the use of Steam Power on the Tramways of the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Ltd.\\" . This order included a schedule of operating restrictions almost identical to that in the order of 1882, but strangely no mention is made of a speed restriction when descending Derby Rd. The steam tram engine operated from the Isandula Rd depot into Nottingham and it towed a tramcar - originally horse-drawn - adapted for use behind the tram engine. William Wilkinson was an ambitions engineer who ran a foundry at Wigan. His earliest known experiments with steam trams were in 1881 when he arranged with the Wigan Tramways Company to try out a steam locomotive he had designed for tramways. A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 gallons of water and had a bunker capable of carrying nine cubic feet of coke. It was a vertical engine with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of small bore and acted upon a crankshaft through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by cog-wheel gears. Exhaust steam was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney. Over 200 Wilkinson engines were built between 1881 and 1886, however, the early popularity of this design outstripped the production capacity of the Wilkinson firm, and other companies manufactured them to the Wilkinson patent. Despite their general reliability, they were not as successful as other manufacturers and production practically ceased in 1886. A Wilkinson engine cost between ¬£600 and ¬£1,100, and an estimate of the running costs (wages, fuel, water, stores, housing, repairs, maintenance and depreciation over 20 years) is around 6d per mile. In 1885 a double deck, top covered, bogie tram had been purchased from Starbucks specifically for operation behind the steam tram. The tramcar had two small oil lamps fitted into the bulkheads and inside it was so dark at night that the conductor had to use a portable lamp clipped to his belt. The tram‚Äôs upper deck had back to back ‚Äòknifeboard' seating running the length of the vehicle and whilst the passengers were protected from smoke and soot by the roof, the sides were open from the modesty rails upwards. The tramcar had a coloured signal light outside and a cord running the length of the saloon, connected with a gong on the engine, for signalling purposes. Steam trams relied upon their weight and adhesion for propulsion and as the town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed to clean out the rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track. The steam tram achieved only limited success and cut just 10 minutes from the 1-hour 10-minute horse-drawn journey from Basford to Nottingham. The report of 1885 in The Railway & Tramway Express reported that the steam tram gave unsatisfactory performance and had more holidays allotted to it than the horses. With running costs of around 6d per mile, each return trip from Basford to Nottingham would have cost the company around 2s 9d. In 1889, it lost its licence and was withdrawn, the 1885 passenger tram car being rebuilt into a horse-drawn, four-wheeled vehicle, being shortened and having its top cover removed. This car spent the rest of its days on the Trent Bridge service. =Other vehicles= In 1883 Starbucks supplied a further two single deck cars, similar to the original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the \\"toast-rack\\" design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or stub axles. Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 and in the same year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker. In 1887 the company purchased a car from the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, this being a double-decker with a single ended body pivoted on the truck. This device removed the need to detach the horses at the terminus, as the horses would turn the car round and be ready to start off in the opposite direction again. This design was not particularly successful and the vehicle was later rebuilt as a standard rigid car with two ends. The Carrington service had, as its competitor, a horse bus service operated by Messrs Andrews of Carrington. When this firm went bankrupt, in 1888, the Tramway Company bought four of their horse buses and converted them to tram cars. In 1891 two of the converted buses were scrapped, as was car No.19, which was an 1881 Starbuck single deck design, converted to double deck in 1885. The other two converted horse buses were renumbered, and four further new cars were obtained. From G.F. Milnes & Co., two double- deckers were purchased, and two of toast rack design came from an unknown maker. It is possible that those two toast rack vehicles were built at Nottingham in the company‚Äôs own works. Illumination inside the trams at night was very poor, and to quote a contemporary writer, \\"gloom prevailed,\\" the only light being a small oil lamp at each end in the recess where the conductor kept his tickets. The tickets were pre-printed, each service having its own series, the stage points being printed lengthways along either side. In 1892, the two remaining converted horse buses were scrapped, one of the toast rack cars was renumbered and a further two double-deckers were obtained from G.F. Milnes being similar in design to those purchased the previous year. In 1895 the horse tram fleet was completed by the purchase of three further double- deckers, this time from the Brush Company‚Äôs Falcon Works at Loughborough. Section 43 of the Tramways Act of 1870 provided that where the promoters of a tramway were not the Local Authority, the Local Authority may, within six months of the expiration of 21 years from the date the promoters were empowered to construct the tramway, acquire the undertaking, at the current value, with and including all lands, buildings, works, materials, horses and rolling stock as required for the operation of the system.  Nottingham Corporation Tramways, 1897 onwards  = Withdrawal of Horse Tram Services = The relationship between Company and Corporation appears to have been an uneasy one. There were complaints from local residents about the running of trams on Sundays. There was a proposal from the company to the council asking to share the cost of narrowing causeways (pavements) on Arkwright St. This was due to the fact that Arkwright St was not sufficiently wide such that vehicles could park on the roadway without obstructing the tramlines. Clearly the council were unhappy, as not only did they not agree to share the cost, they insisted that the company leave the pavements as they were. There was also a disagreement with the company over the maintenance of the roads in which the tramways ran. The work was supposed to be done by the Corporation, with the bills being paid by the company, but the company found it was cheaper to hire in labour directly. The Corporation threatened proceedings and insisted on the withdrawal of the company's labour. In November 1878 the company announced proposals for extensions. These included lines from the Market Place to St. Ann's Well Road and Bridge St Radford, a connection between the northern and southern sections along Wheeler Gate, and a line from the end of Station Street across Plumtree Square to connect with the St. Ann's Well Road route at Alfred Street South. If built this would have added 3 miles 6 furlongs 1.25 chains to the network giving a total length of 9 miles 3 furlongs 7.25 chains. These were discussed by the Corporation at a council meeting on 6 January 1879 and cautiously the General Works and Highways Committee were instructed to watch the position. Four weeks later, on 3 February, the committee recommended opposition to the proposed extension of the tramways for present and this was agreed. Perhaps these proposals were put forward again to the council for on 5 December 1881, on the recommendation of General Works and Highways Committee, the council decided that the plans for extension of tramways would be deferred until the site of the new central railway station (later Victoria Station) was settled. The company did not give up, or perhaps they did not get the message from the council. A fresh proposal of extensions was drawn up and put to the council on 13 November 1882. These included lines from Market Place to St. Ann's Well Road, Bridge Street Radford, Woodborough Road, Carlton Road, and across Trent Bridge - a length of 8 miles 6 furlongs, which would have taken the total network to 14 miles 8 furlongs 6 chains. On 4 December the Council was asked to support this application by unnamed promoters to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order to extend tramways but they refused. The tramways were the subject of debate at the next meeting on 8 January 1883 and it was resolved that the Corporation should purchase on equitable terms the tramway lines of the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited and should make all further extensions themselves, and lease the lines to a Company. The motivation for this was probably less to do with the series of disagreements between company and corporation that had been experienced since the lines opened, and more to do with the profitability of the company. However, the company had a 21-year licence for operating the tramway and nothing was done until 1890 when the Corporation was petitioned by the Directors of the Nottinghamshire and Midland Merchants and Traders' Association. :the tram service in Nottingham is not equal to the requirements of the town. That from the hilly nature of the town, travelling by means of horses is exceedingly slow and expensive, and a quicker and cheaper mode of transit ought to be adopted. That various parts of the town which ought to be supplied have no tram facilities. That the want of communication between the lines in Market Place and St. Peter's Square is a great inconvenience [etc]\\" The Corporation agreed and sought some compromise arrangement between the Company and Corporation but action was slow. Five years later on 9 December 1895 it was resolved: :That the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to ascertain :(1) The terms upon which the Nottingham Tramways Company now carry on their undertaking in the highways and streets of the town, and when their powers will terminate; :(2) What powers the Corporation possess with regard to the Nottingham Tramways; :(3) What steps it is desirable that the Corporation should take in relation to the Tramways; :(4) If it is found desirable that the Corporation should move in the matter, to advise what course should be adopted. It took the parliamentary committee nine months to propose on 7 September 1896 :that the Local Authority may apply to purchase 21 years after the inception of the tramway, which will fall in 1898. That considerable extensions of the service are desirable e.g. to Sherwood, Mapperley Plains, Wells Rd, Sneinton, Bulwell, Lenton and Radford; and that Parliamentary powers are necessary before the Corporation can engage in their work. Order given for Town Clerk to proceed with a Bill and preparations to be made for an application to acquire the tramways in 1898. Meanwhile, enquiries to be made on the running of tramways by Councils in other towns. When the Nottingham Corporation took over the undertaking, but the Directors of the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited continued, in office, as Trustees on behalf of the Nottingham Corporation until such time as the Corporation was empowered to act independently. On 14 June 1897 the Corporation purchased the tramway for ¬£80,000 (), and on 10 September 1897 the final meeting of the shareholders was held. On 18 October 1897 the system was handed over to the Corporation. The Corporation was empowered under Sections 41 and 42 of the Nottingham Improvement Act 1897 to operate the existing tramways, with the exception of that along Forest Rd, by animal or mechanical power. Seven new routes were also approved. The existing system continued to be operated by the Corporation, under the direction of the Manager Mr A. Baker. All vehicles were re-painted in maroon and cream with ‚ÄòNottingham Corporation Tramways‚Äô replacing the company name. In 1898 the Tramways Committee authorised the purchase of uniforms for the men operating on the tramcars, and made some improvements to the tramcars, including modifying the seats on the upper decks of double-deck cars to make them into \\"Automatic Rainproof\\" seats and installing clocks in each car on the Basford route. They also increased the service on the Basford route after mid-day, so there was a car leaving the Market Place every five minutes rather than every ten. The fare on the return journey between Newdigate Street and the Market place was reduced to 1d. The wages for the staff were also increased in 1898, drivers with three years experience were on 28s per week, and conductors 22s 9d. Over the next two years there was a dramatic rise in patronage and hence weekly revenue from the system with the average increasing from around ¬£600 to ¬£900 (),. The Tramways Committee also formalised the stopping places for the tramcars, and negotiated with the Corporation Lighting Committee to have the lampposts at tramstops painted in a distinctive colour with a different coloured glass in the lantern. Whether this was actually carried out is not recorded. The tramstops on Arkwright Street were determined to be Crocus Street, Cromford Street, Kirkwhite Street, Atlas Street, Glebe Street, Ryehill Street and Lamcote Street. Crocus Street and Lamcote Street were request stops only. The Tramways Committee met nearly every two weeks and the minutes record a constant stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages too numerous to list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against tramcar drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to tramcar drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897. On 28 March 1898, the Corporation agreed to the proposal of the Tramways Committee on re- constructing the existing tramways, and extensions required; and as to the method of traction to be adopted \\"that the whole of the permanent way should be reconstructed with much heavier rails; that the whole system should be equipped with electric traction\\". On 16 May the Tramways Committee proposed the following alterations in routes, which are approved: :* Basford single line to be doubled and extended to Bulwell :* Carrington Line to be doubled and extended to Winchester St Sherwood. :New lines to be made along : :(1) Sherwood Rise :(2) Lower Parliament St, King Edward St, St. Anns Well Rd and Wells Rd :(3) Grey Friars Gate and Lenton Boulevard to Hartley Rd returning via Canal St :(4) Wilford Rd to Wilford Bridge :(5) W (oodborough Rd and Mapperley Plains to Porchester Rd :(6) Wheeler Gate to the Market Place, which will become a tram centre. The 1900 Annual Report of the Tramways CommitteeAnnual Report of the Tramways Committee, Nottingham Corporation, 10 September 1900 states :The undertaking is in a transition state, owing to the decision of the Council to substitute electric motive power for the present horse traction\\". The Manager (J. Aldworth) reported \\"The increase of wages granted to conductors come into operation early in June last year and these now range from 20/- to 25/-, against 17/6 to 22/9 per week . . . I have pleasure in saying I consider the greater attention to detail given to the work shown by a great decrease in the number of complaints received from the public and the substantial increase in receipts has fully justified the action. No of passengers 8,441,193. Miles run, 790,074. An outbreak of \\"pink eye\\" in the stud of horses in 1900 resulted in a severe curtailment of the horse-drawn service. Kelly's Directory of Nottinghamshire for 1900Kelly's Directory of Nottinghamshire, 1900 gives an idea of the extent of the operation of the system at the end of its life: :Station Route from St. Peter's church to Great Northern railway; leave St. Peter's church at 7.45am and every 5 minutes till 9.55pm; leave Great Northern railway 7.55am and every 5 minutes till 10.05pm :Trent Bridge route from St. Peter's church to Trent Bridge; leave St. Peter's church at 8.05am and every 5 minutes till 11pm; leave Trent Bridge at 7.30am and every 5 minutes till 10.40pm :Basford route, from Market Place to Old Basford; leave Market Place 8am and every 10 minutes till 10.50pm; leave Old Basford 7.25am and every 10 minutes till 9.55pm; every 5 minutes to Grand Theatre from 12.05pm to 10.45pm :Carrington Route, from Parliament Street to Carrington; leave Parliament Street at 8am and every 7¬Ω minutes till 10.45pm; leave Carrington 7.37am and every 7¬Ω minutes till 10.22pm. :Forest route, from Market Place to Forest Road; leave Market Place 8.20am and every 20 minutes till 10.20pm; leave Forest Road (Burns Street) 8.10am and every 20 minutes till 10.10pm. :Omnibuses to New Basford - Tramway Co from Smithy Row every 20 minutes :Omnibuses to Bridgford - Edward Mann and Nottingham and District Tramways Company from St. Peters square every ¬Ω hour :Omnibuses to Trent Bridge - Edward Mann and Nottingham and District Tramways Company from St. Peter's square every 15 minutes Horse buses supplemented the services whilst track relaying was carried out for the new electric trams. On 17 April 1901 a horse tram service operated from Gregory Boulevard to Bulwell Market over the new rails. As the section of track between Gregory Boulevard and the Market place was re-laid, gradually the horse tram service was extended such that on 29 June trams were operating the complete journey from Nottingham to Bulwell. This lasted less than a month and electric vehicles replaced horse power on 23 July 1901. The other horse tram services were phased out, as electrified routes were completed. On 1 January 1901 the Sherwood route commenced electric services, and on 21 October 1901 electric services were introduced on the Trent Bridge and Station St services. By the end of 1901, the Tramways Committee reported that the service on the Forest Route was experiencing substantial losses, and it was reduced to a \\"quarter hour\\" service.

The album was released in the UK in June 1965. The band's lead singer and songwriter was Van Morrison. In the U.S., the album was released as Them with partly different tracks.  Cover  As with several Decca releases of the period, the name of the group was conspicuously absent from the front cover and on the back of the LP they were introduced as The Angry Young Them with an essay on this theme declaring: \\"These five young rebels are outrageously true to themselves. Defiant! Angry! Sad! They are honest to the point of insult!\\" Release history Six of the songs on the album were Morrison originals, including the famous garage band anthem \\"Gloria\\". Another song on the album, \\"Mystic Eyes\\", was a spontaneous creation that came out of the band just \\"busking around\\" in Morrison's words and after seven minutes of instrumental playing he impulsively threw in the words of a song he had been working on. The lengthy versions of \\"Gloria\\" that the band performed at the Maritime and the ten-minute recording of \\"Mystic Eyes\\" have never surfaced. All that is left of the \\"Mystic Eyes\\" performance is the little over 2 minutes on the album that remained after splicing out from the beginning and ending. \\"You Just Can't Win\\" was a Dylan inspired song about a gold digger, set in specific places in London such as Camden Town. \\"Little Girl\\" was about a boy's obsession with a fourteen-year-old school girl (an earlier take on Lord's Taverners charity album had been deleted when a four-letter word was heard in the fade out at the end). \\"If You And I Could Be As Two\\" starts with a spoken introduction by Morrison with an aggressive Irish accent.

Heinemann Park namesake Alexander Julius (A.J.) Heinemann was an officer and shareholder in the New Orleans Pelicans baseball organization, but the principal owner of the Pelicans was Charles Somers. Heinemann was, however, the principal owner of the stadium and grounds where the Pelicans played. He began his career as a peanut and soda-pop vendor at Sportsman's Park in New Orleans and worked his way up through the ranks. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his office at the ballpark in January 1930. Tenants It was most notably used by the New Orleans Pelicans baseball team from 1915 through 1957. The New Orleans Negro league baseball teams, the New Orleans Black Pelicans and New Orleans Creoles also played at the stadium. The New Orleans‚ÄìSt. Louis Stars also played half of their home games here in 1941. The ballpark was the Cleveland Indian's spring training location in 1916‚Äì1920 and 1928‚Äì1939; the Boston Red Sox held their spring training at the ballpark in 1925‚Äì1927. Location Pelican Stadium/Heinemann Park, 1934 The stadium was designed by New Orleans architect Emile Weil and constructed at the southeast corner of Tulane Avenue and South Carrollton Avenue in Mid-City New Orleans, an area that was only recently being developed thanks to improved drainage. A short lived amusement park called \\"White City\\", was on the site just before, which in turn had replaced the Pelicans prior home field, Athletic Park. The Park spanned by . Pelican Park (or Stadium) was located at Banks St. and Carrollton Avenue across the street from the present-day site of Jesuit High School. In 1914‚Äì1915, the park's wooden grandstand was disassembled and relocated three blocks down Carrollton Avenue by mules allocated by Heinemann to the intersection of Carrollton Avenue and Tulane Avenue. It reopened on April 13, 1915. Pelican Stadium was bounded by Tulane Avenue (northeast, left field); South Carrollton Avenue (northwest, home plate); Gravier Street, railroad tracks, and the New Basin Canal (southwest, right field); and Pierce Street (southeast, center field). The rail yards and canal visible behind the right field area in old photos have since been replaced and covered by Interstate 10 and its approach ramps. A pair of round-roofed buildings which sat across Gravier behind right center, are still visible on Google Maps. American football The stadium was also used for high school football. The field was laid out with one end zone between home plate and third base and the other one in front of the scoreboard. The stadium had a 9,000-seat capacity for football. In 1921, Warren Easton High School played Minden High School for the LHSAA championship at the stadium. Boxing Boxing matches were held at the stadium including matches that featured lightweight champion and hall of famer, Joe Brown. Demolition Historical marker for the ballpark It was demolished in 1957, becoming the site of Fountainbleau Hotel, and more recently a storage company and dorms for Xavier University of Louisiana students.

After the signing of the treaty, an army of the Turkish National Movement under K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir invaded and defeated Armenia, also recapturing territory which the Ottoman Empire had lost to the Russian Empire in 1878. The Turkish military victory was followed by Soviet Union's occupation and Sovietization of Armenia. The Treaty of Moscow (March 1921) between Soviet Russia and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the related Treaty of Kars (October 1921) confirmed the territorial gains made by Karabekir and established the modern Turkish‚ÄìArmenian border. Armenia had territorial disputes with the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans had tried to move the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and occupied the South Caucasus during Summer 1918. Armenia resisted until the Allied forces won WWI. The Ottomans maintained their troops along their territorial gains until Spring 1919.  Background  The dissolution of the Russian Empire in the wake of the February Revolution saw the Armenians of the South Caucasus declaring their independence and formally establishing the First Republic of Armenia.For the period leading up to independence see Richard G. Hovannisian (1967). Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918. Berkeley: University of California Press. . In its two years of existence, the tiny republic, with its capital in Yerevan, was beset with a number of debilitating problems, ranging from fierce territorial disputes with its neighbors and an appalling refugee crisis.The full history of the Armenian republic is covered by Richard G. Hovannisian, Republic of Armenia. 4 Vols. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971‚Äì1996. Armenia's most crippling problem was its dispute with its neighbor to the west, the Ottoman Empire. Approximately 1.5 million Armenians had perished during the Armenian Genocide. Although the armies of the Ottoman Empire eventually occupied the South Caucasus in the summer of 1918 and stood poised to crush the republic, Armenia resisted until the end of October, when the Ottoman Empire capitulated to the Allied powers. Though the Ottoman Empire was partially occupied by the Allies, and while being invaded by Franco-Armenian forces of the Cilicia Campaign, the Turks did not withdraw their forces to the pre-war Russo-Turkish boundary until February 1919 and maintained many troops mobilized along this frontier. Bolshevik and Turkish nationalist movements During the First World War and in the ensuing peace negotiations in Paris, the Allies had vowed to punish the Turks and reward some, if not all, the eastern provinces of the empire to the nascent Armenian republic.Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"The Allies and Armenia, 1915‚Äì18.\\" Journal of Contemporary History. Vol. 3, No. 1 (Jan., 1968), pp. 145‚Äì168. But the Allies were more concerned with concluding the peace treaties with Germany and the other European members of the Central Powers. In matters related to the Near East, the principal powers, Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States, had conflicting interests over the spheres of influence they were to assume. While there were crippling internal disputes between the Allies, and the United States was reluctant to accept a mandate over Armenia, disaffected elements in the Ottoman Empire in 1920 began to disavow the decisions made by the Ottoman government in Constantinople, coalesced and formed the Turkish National Movement, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The Turkish Nationalists considered any partition of formerly Ottoman lands (and subsequent distribution to non-Turkish authorities) to be unacceptable. Their avowed goal was to \\"guarantee the safety and unity of the country.\\" The Bolsheviks sympathized with the Turkish Movement due to their mutual opposition to \\"Western Imperialism,\\" as the Bolsheviks referred to it.Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"Armenia and the Caucasus in the Genesis of the Soviet-Turkish Entente.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2 (April, 1973), pp. 129‚Äì147. In his message to Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolsheviks, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' \\"fight against imperialist governments\\" and requested five million lira in gold as well as armaments \\"as first aid\\" to his forces.

In 1920, the Lenin government supplied the Kemalists with 6,000 rifles, more than five million rifle cartridges, and 17,600 projectiles, as well as 200.6 kg of gold bullion; in the following two years the amount of aid increased. Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn, 1963, ‚Ññ 11, p. 148. In the negotiations of the Treaty of Moscow (1921), the Bolsheviks demanded that the Turks cede Batum and Nakhichevan; they also asked for more rights in the future status of the Straits.Erik J. Z√ºrcher: Turkey: A Modern History, I.B.Tauris, 2004, , p. 153. Despite the concessions made by the Turks, the financial and military supplies were slow in coming. Only after the decisive Battle of Sakarya (August‚ÄìSeptember 1921), the aid started to flow in faster. After much delays, the Armenians received from the Allies in July 1920 about 40,000 uniforms and 25,000 rifles with a great amount of ammunition.(French) Ter Minassian, Anahide (1989). La r√©publique d'Arm√©nie. 1918‚Äì1920 La m√©moire du si√®cle, Brussels: √âditions complexe, , p. 196. It was not until August 1920 that the Allies drafted the peace settlement of the Near East, in the form of the Treaty of S√®vres. The United States had refused to assume the Armenian mandate in May of that year, but the Allies delegated the US to draw the western boundaries of the republic. The US allotted four of the six eastern provinces to the Ottoman Empire, including an outlet to the Black Sea.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 40‚Äì44. The Treaty of S√®vres served to confirm Kemal's suspicions about Allied plans to partition the empire. According to the historian Richard G. Hovannisian, his decision to order the invasion of Armenia was intended to show the Allies that \\"the treaty would not be accepted and that there would be no peace until the West was ready to offer new terms in keeping with the principles of the Turkish National Pact.\\"Hovannisian.

Skirmishes between Turkish forces and the Armenian military in the border of Kars were frequent during that summer, although full-scale hostilities did not break out until September. Convinced that the Allies would not come to the defense of Armenia and aware that the ADR's leaders had failed to gain recognition of its independence by Soviet Russia, Kemal gave the order to commanding general K√¢zƒ±m Karabekir to advance into Armenia.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 182‚Äì184. At 2:30 in the morning of September 13, five battalions from the Turkish XV Army Corps crossed the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian border and surprised the thinly spread and unprepared Armenian armies at Olti and Peniak (now Penek village in ≈ûenkaya district). By dawn, Karabekir's forces had occupied Peniak, and the Armenians had suffered at least 200 casualties and been forced to retreat east towards Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 184‚Äì190. As neither the Allied powers nor Soviet Russia reacted to Turkish operations, on September 20 Kemal authorized Karabekir to push onwards and take Kars and Kaƒüƒ±zman. By this time, Karabekir's XV Corps had grown to the size of four divisions. At 3:00 in the morning of September 28, the four divisions of the XV Army Corps advanced towards Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü, creating such panic that Armenian residents had abandoned the town by the time the Turks entered the next day.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 191‚Äì197. The armed forces started toward Kars but were delayed by Armenian resistance. In early October, the Armenian government pleaded that the Allies intervene and put a halt to the Turkish advance, to no avail. Most of Britain's available forces in the Near East were concentrated on crushing the tribal uprisings in Iraq, while France and Italy were also fighting the Turkish revolutionaries near Syria and Italian controlled Antalya.Hewsen, Robert H. Armenia: A Historical Atlas. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 237. Neighboring Georgia declared neutrality during the conflict. On October 11, Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran arrived in Yerevan with a text to negotiate a new Soviet-Armenian agreement. The agreement signed at October 24 secured Soviet support. The most important part of this agreement dealt with Kars, which Armenia agreed to secure.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, p. 259. The Turkish national movement was not happy with possible agreement between the Soviets and Armenia. Karabekir was informed by the Government of the Grand National Assembly regarding the Boris Legran agreement and ordered to resolve the Kars issue. The same day the agreement between Armenia and Soviet Russia was signed, Karabekir moved his forces toward Kars. = Capture of Kars = Armenian civilians flee Kars after its capture by Turkish forces On October 24, Karabekir's forces launched a new, massive campaign against Kars. The Armenians abandoned the city, which by October 30 came under full Turkish occupation.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 253‚Äì261. Turkish forces continued to advance, and a week after the capture of Kars, they took control of Alexandropol (present-day Gyumri, Armenia.) On November 12, the Turks also captured the strategic village of Aghin, northeast of the ruins of the former Armenian capital of Ani, and planned to move toward Yerevan. On November 13, Georgia broke its neutrality. It had concluded an agreement with Armenia to invade the disputed region of Lori, which was established as a Neutral Zone (the Shulavera Condominium) between the two nations in early 1919.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 222‚Äì226. = Treaty of Alexandropol = An article from the New York Times, December 10, 1920 The Turks, headquartered in Alexandropol, presented the Armenians with an ultimatum which they were forced to accept. They followed it with a more radical demand which threatened the existence of Armenia as a viable entity. The Armenians at first rejected this demand, but when Karabekir's forces continued to advance, they had little choice but to capitulate. On November 18, 1920, they concluded a cease-fire agreement. During the invasion the Turkish Army carried out mass atrocities against Armenian civilians in Kars and Alexandropol. These included rapes and massacres where tens of thousands of civilians were executed. As the terms of defeat were being negotiated between Karabekir and Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander Khatisyan, Joseph Stalin, on the command of Vladimir Lenin, ordered Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze to enter Armenia from Azerbaijan in order to establish a new pro-Bolshevik government in the country. On November 29, the Soviet Eleventh Army invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day Ijevan). After the capture of Yerevan and Echmiadzin by Bolshevik forces on 2 December 1920, the Armenian government signed the Treaty of Alexandropol on 3 December 1920, though it no longer existed as a legal entity. The treaty required Armenia to disarm most of its military forces, and cede all Ottoman territory that had been granted to Armenia by the Treaty of S√®vres. The Armenian Parliament never ratified the treaty, as the Soviet invasion took place at the same time and the communists took over the country.  Aftermath  The Soviet-Turkish frontier established in the Treaty of Kars. In late November 1920, there was a Soviet-backed communist uprising in Armenia. On November 28, 1920, blaming Armenia for the invasions of ≈û…ôrur (20 November) and Karabakh (21 November), the 11th Red Army under the command of Anatoli Gekker crossed the demarcation line between Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted a week. Exhausted by the six years of wars and conflicts, the Armenian army and population were incapable of active resistance. When the Red Army entered Yerevan on December 4, 1920, the government of Armenian Republic effectively surrendered. On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom, consisting mostly of Armenians from Azerbaijan) also entered the city. Finally, on December 6, the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky's secret police, entered Yerevan. The Soviets took control and Armenia ceased to exist as an independent state. Soon afterward, the bolsheviks declared the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. =Settlement= The warfare in Transcaucasia was settled in a friendship treaty between the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (GNAT) (which proclaimed the Turkish Republic in 1923), and Soviet Russia (RSFSR). The \\"Treaty on Friendship and Brotherhood,\\" called the Treaty of Moscow, was signed on March 16, 1921.

When developed in 1905-1908, it was the first Atlanta suburban neighborhood designed for automobiles, featuring wide, winding roads rather than the grid pattern typical of older streetcar suburbs. Streets were planned like parkways with extensive landscaping, while Winn Park and McClatchey Park are themselves long and narrow, extending deep into the neighborhood. Ansley Golf Club borders the district. The neighborhood was largely completed by 1930 and covers . It has been designated a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, the median household income for the neighborhood was $226,335. To the immediate east of the golf course is the Eastside Trail interim hiking trail, part of the BeltLine ring of parks and trails around the central city. History The area was developed by rail and real estate magnate Edwin P. Ansley, while George W. Adair, Jr. and Forrest Adair marketed the lots. It was marketed as an alternative for the city's elite to Inman Park, the most fashionable residential neighborhood in the city at the time. It was more fashionably located, astride Peachtree Street and adjacent to the city's largest public park. With Edwin Ansley's former residence serving as the governor's mansion and the Piedmont Driving Club adjacent, the area remained upscale until the 1960s when a slight decline was experienced with some residences turning into boarding houses. However, residents turned this decline around and the area never experienced the deep decline in the 1950s-1960s due to suburbanization, as neighborhoods like Inman Park did.

Two hours before the scheduled execution, the State of California notified the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that they could not comply with a lower federal judge's ruling that the execution must be carried out by a medical professional due to the chemical used in the execution. Consequently, California has indefinitely suspended Morales' execution. The case subsequently led to a moratorium on capital punishment in California entirely, as the only legal method of execution must be carried out with the participation of a licensed physician, who are ethically prohibited from participating in executions.  Death of Terri Winchell  Michael Morales was convicted of murdering 17-year-old Terri Winchell on January 8, 1981. Winchell was in a love triangle with Richard Ortega, a cousin of Morales, and another man. Ortega hired Morales to kill Winchell so that Ortega could have exclusive relations with his male lover. According to prosecutors, Morales attacked Winchell from behind and tried to strangle her with his belt. Morales then hit her head with a hammer, beating her into unconsciousness, and crushing the victim's skull. Morales then dragged Winchell face-down across the road and into a vineyard, where he raped her and stabbed her four times in the chest. Winchell died from both the head and chest wounds. =Trial and appeals= Morales has not denied that he committed the crime. His defense team argued, however, that since he was high on PCP at the time, the murder does not qualify for the \\"special circumstances\\" required by California state law for the death penalty. Morales' defense argued that the crime was not premeditated, despite the fact that he had told Ortega that he would defend him. The prosecution countered with evidence showing that Morales gathered tools before the encounter, practiced strangulation on two female acquaintances, and confessed to an informant while in jail. Charles McGrath, the judge who originally sentenced Morales to execution, has announced that he has had a change of heart in the case. He now says he now doubts the testimony of an informant against Morales. Notably, the informant claimed that Morales confessed to him in Spanish, a language Morales does not speak. McGrath asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to grant Morales clemency under state law. In addition, Morales has claimed that he has found God in prison, and regrets the crime that he committed. In early 2006, lead defense attorney David Senior hired former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr to be one of Morales' attorneys on the appeals. Immediately prior to Morales' execution date, Senior filed papers claiming that five out of the 12 jurors had doubts about sentencing him to death. However, prosecutors alleged that the documents were forgeries, and accused investigator and anti-death penalty activist Kathleen Culhane of falsifying the documents. Senior and his team soon withdrew the documents. Ultimately, clemency was denied, but the falsified documents were not used in the rationale. Eventually, Culhane was criminally charged with forging the documents and, under a plea agreement, was sentenced to five years in prison. At her sentencing hearing, Culhane refused to express remorse to the State of California, stating her acts were crimes of conscience against Morales' execution and the death penalty.  Postponed execution  Morales' original execution date of February 21, 2006, was postponed as a result of two court-appointed anesthesiologists withdrawing from the procedure. This is the first death row inmate extant since a judge ruled that the current combination of drugs may cause severe pain, as corroborated by an April 2005 study published in The Lancet. The doctors cited ethical reasons for the decision to withdraw. They had been ordered by the court to intervene in the event Morales woke up or appeared to be in pain. Since both doctors withdrew, California planned to overdose Morales on intravenous barbiturates, the only other option allowed by the court. The judge further ruled that the barbiturates could only be administered by a \\"licensed medical professional,\\" meaning a doctor, nurse or other medical technician legally authorized to administer I.V. medications. Since all such medical personnel are bound by professional ethics against performing an execution, this ruling virtually assured that the execution could not take place. Having failed to find a medical professional willing to carry out the execution, California decided it could not comply with the judge's decision and would allow the death warrant to lapse. The death warrant will now have to be re-issued by the original trial judge, Charles McGrath, who has indicated that he no longer believes testimony from the 1982 trial and asked for clemency for Morales.

The son of a weaver, born in Halifax, Yorkshire, and educated for the ministry at the Baptist college in Bristol, Foster served as a minister for a number of years. Becoming a full-time writer, he contributed nearly 200 articles to the Eclectic Review. His works include Essays, in a Series of Letters (1804), and Essay on the Evils of Popular Ignorance (1820), in which he urged the necessity of a national system of education. Life He was the eldest son of John Foster, a small farmer, weaver and Baptist, living at Wadsworth Lane in the parish of Halifax, Yorkshire, born 17 September 1770. From a young age he assisted his parents in spinning and weaving wool. At age 17 he became a member of the Baptist congregation at Hebden Bridge; and soon after was \\"set apart\\" as minister by a special religious service, and went to reside at Brearley Hall with John Fawcett, who was directing the studies of some Baptist students. After three years here he entered the Baptist College, Bristol, in September 1791, remaining there till May 1792, and then entering on the regular work of a preacher. Foster first took charge of a small Baptist society at Newcastle-on-Tyne for three months in 1792. In the beginning of 1793 he went to Dublin to minister at a meeting-house in Swift's Alley. He lost his congregation, a recurring feature of his life. He went home, but returned to Dublin in 1795 to take charge of the classical and mathematical school of John Walker, which after eight or nine months he gave up as a failure. He was close to some of the extreme Dublin democrats, exposing him to the danger of imprisonment. In February 1796 Foster returned once more to Wadsworth Lane, and remained there until early in 1797 he became minister of a general Baptist congregation at Chichester. About midsummer 1799 he removed to the house of an early friend, the Rev. Joseph Hughes, at Battersea, where he spent several months in preaching, and teaching twenty African boys whom Zachary Macaulay was training for mission work. In 1800 he took charge of a small congregation at Downend, near Bristol, and in February 1804 of one at Sheppard's Barton, Frome. In summer 1806 Foster resigned the charge of the Sheppard's Barton congregation, troubled with a thyroid, and concentrated on writing. In May 1808 he married and went to live at Bourton in Gloucestershire. About a year after that his throat so far recovered as to allow him to resume occasional preaching, and towards the end of 1817 he again took charge of the congregation at Downend. In 1821 he gave it up and went to live at Stapleton, Gloucestershire. In 1822 he began to lecture fortnightly in Broadmead Chapel, Bristol; at the end of two years poor health forced him to make the lectures monthly, and in 1825, when Robert Halls began his ministry in Bristol, he dropped them. Foster became involved in a controversy between the Serampore missionaries, Carey, Marshman, and Ward, and the committee of the Baptist Missionary Society, strongly siding with the missionaries. In 1836 his health began to give way, and his lungs became diseased. On 24 September 1843 he took to his room, and on Sunday morning, 15 October, he was found dead in bed. He was buried in the burial-ground attached to the Downend baptist chapel. Publications * Life and Correspondence, edited by Ryland (London, 1846; republished in Bohn's Library, 1852) Foster's Essays were published in 1805. They originated in conversations with Maria Snooke, whom he had first met at Battersea, and who later became his wife, and were addressed to her. An introductory letter, dated \\"Near Bristol, 30 Aug. 1804\\", mentions reasons for writing them. The book contained four essays: \\"On a Man's Writing Memoirs of Himself\\", \\"On Decision of Character\\", \\"On the Application of the Epithet Romantic\\", and \\"On Some of the Causes by which Evangelical Religion has been rendered less acceptable to Persons of Cultivated Taste\\". In about four months a second edition was called for, and a third was published in 1806. Foster became a regular contributor to the Eclectic Review, his first article, a review of Sir John Carr's Stranger in Ireland, appearing in November 1806. He continued to write for it till 1839, his last piece being published in July of that year. Altogether he contributed 184 articles, a number of which were republished in his Contributions, Biographical, Literary, and Philosophical, to the \\"Eclectic Review\\" (2 vols. London, 1844). In 1818, while at Downend, Foster published his Discourse on Missions. Two volumes of his Broadmead Chapel lectures were published. In 1820, he published his essay On the Evils of Popular Ignorance, based on a sermon preached on behalf of the British and Foreign School Society in 1818. It speedily went into a second edition, heavily revised. In 1825 he completed an introductory essay to Philip Doddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion for the series of Select Christian Authors published by William Collins of Glasgow.

She was awarded the People's Artist of Armenia title in 2004. Papian was named a Cultural ambassador of Armenia in the World for her contributions to Armenian culture in 2005 by the Catholicos of the Holy See of St. Echmiadzin and All Armenians Karekin II and awarded the Order of Saint Sahag and Saint Mesrob and Order of Saint Mesrop Mashdots. She has been described by The Washington Post as \\"the best Norma alive.\\"  Biography  Hasmik Papian was born in Yerevan, Armenia (then part of the Soviet Union) on 2 September 1961. She first began an interest in music when she started playing the violin at the age of 5. Papian graduated from Komitas High Academy in Yerevan first as a violinist, then as a singer. Her friends had encouraged her to explore her voice, and Tatevik Sazandaryan, the head of the vocal department at Komitas, had told Papian after hearing a couple of notes from her that she had to sing. After her debut at the Armenian National Opera, she was invited as a soloist among others by Opera Bonn and Deutsche Oper am Rhein, D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Soon, she started an international career and has since appeared at numerous theaters, including the most prestigious operatic stages and concert houses in the world like The Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall in New York, San Francisco Opera, Washington National Opera, La Scala of Milan, Op√©ra Bastille in Paris, Gran Theatre del Liceu Barcelona, Teatro Real Madrid, London Wigmore Hall, the Vienna State Opera and Musikverein Vienna, Concertgebouw and De Nederlandse Opera Amsterdam, Zurich Opera, Mariinsky Theatre St. Petersburg, as well as the state operas of Munich, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Dresden and Berlin.Papian biography Papian attributes her big break to winning the Belvedere Singing Competition in Vienna in 1990. One of the prizes of the Belvedere competition was to sing from her repertoire at the Grand Theatre in Warsaw. She had included Norma in her stock of plays, though hadn't expected to sing it due to her youth and inexperience. Papian accepted a last-minute offer to sing Norma at the Teatr Wielki although she had never sung the opera live before, and prepared in five days‚Äô notice, two brief rehearsal days, and a single orchestra rehearsal. Norma would later become her signature role. Papian sang Norma for the first time on in Warsaw in 1993, where Giancarlo del Monaco, son of Mario Del Monaco, caught her performance and offered her a contract with the Opera Bonn in Germany. Her professional career as an opera singer had then began. This very first contract was for principal roles in Verdi‚Äôs La traviata, Donna Anna in Mozart‚Äôs Don Giovanni, and Micaela in Bizet‚Äôs Carmen. She sang Tosca for the first time at the Vienna State Opera in 1995.  Repertoire  Her repertoire ranges from Mozart's Donna Anna (Don Giovanni), Rossini's Mathilde (William Tell), Hal√©vy's Rachel (La Juive) and Bizet's Mica√´la (Carmen), passing by Puccini's Mim√¨ (La Boh√®me), Magda (La Rondine), Tosca, Madama Butterfly, Ponchielli's Gioconda (La Gioconda), and Boito's Margareta/ Elena (Mefistofele) to Tchaikovsky's Lisa (The Queen of Spades) and Richard Wagner's Senta (The Flying Dutchman). It contains twelve Verdi-roles: La Traviata, Desdemona (Otello), Aida, Leonora (Il Trovatore and La forza del destino), Elisabetta (Don Carlo), Elena (I vespri siciliani), Amelia (Simon Boccanegra), Elvira (Ernani), Lady Macbeth, Abigaille (Nabucco), Odabella (Attila) as well as the Requiem. A central part for her is Bellini's Norma; she has appeared in this role among others at Vienna Volksoper, at the Regio of Turin, in Montreal, Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Washington, D.C. and at the Metropolitan Opera New York, at Op√©ra de Marseille, Op√©ra de Montpellier, at the festivals Chor√©gies d'Orange (South of France) and Luglio Trapanese (Sicily), in Mannheim, Stuttgart, St. Gallen, Split, Rotterdam and at De Nederlandse Opera Amsterdam. The Amsterdam production has been released on DVD in October 2006. In January 2009, she has added another bel canto role to her repertoire: Queen Elizabeth I in Donizetti's Roberto Devereux (debut at The Dallas Opera).  Artistic appearances  Papian has appeared in most European countries, in Israel, Lebanon (Baalbeck International Festival), Japan, Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile), as well as Canada (Toronto, Montreal) and the United States where she is invited regularly (besides Washington, DC, San Francisco and the Met also Baltimore, Detroit, Cincinnati Festival and Denver, among others). She has performed with many notable conductors ‚Äì such as Riccardo Muti, Valery Gergiev, Georges Pr√™tre, Michel Plasson, Marcello Viotti, Maurizio Arena, Myung-whun Chung, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Pl√°cido Domingo, Leonard Slatkin, James Morris and James Conlon. Papian is also very active promoting the music of fellow Armenian composers such as Komitas Vardapet, Yeranian, Kanatchian, Tchoukhadjian, Tigranian, Avet Terterian and Tigran Mansurian in her recitals. In 2006, a Super Audio CD with 36 songs of Komitas had been released, including some nine songs on German poetry recorded there for the first time ever. In addition, she makes the time to perform several benefit concerts for worthy causes, including the Armenian Relief Society of Lebanon, UNICEF, Mammography Center of Yerevan, Gyumri rebuilding efforts, and Armenian Genocide commemorative events. She was honored in 2004 with the title of the \\"People's Artist\\" of the Republic of Armenia and had received the Order of Saint Mesrop Mashdots from Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia Aram I. In 2005, Papian was awarded the Order of Saint Sahag and Saint Mesrob from the hands of Catholicos Karekin II of Armenia at the Holy Mother See of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Echmiadzin, for her role as a \\"cultural ambassador of Armenia throughout the world\\".

It holds the distinction of being the first jet-powered passenger liner to be developed and produced in West Germany (the East German Baade 152 being the first German jet airliner), as well as the first German-built civil aircraft to have been manufactured for a decade.Mendenhall 2005, p. 326. The VFW 614 was originally proposed during the early 1960s as the E.614, which was a concept for a 36‚Äì40 seat aircraft by a consortium of West German aircraft companies, who were soon re-organised into Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW). It was originally intended as a Douglas DC-3 replacement; its most distinctive feature was that its engines were mounted in pods on pylons above the wing. The VFW 614 was produced in small numbers during the early- to mid-1970s by VFW-Fokker, a company resulting from a merger between VFW and the Dutch aircraft company Fokker. However, the program was officially cancelled in 1977, the anticipated sales and thus production having not been achieved. Development Overwing pylon-mounted Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H The VFW 614 was originally proposed in 1961 by the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) group, comprising Focke-Wulf, Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) and Weser as the E.614, a 36‚Äì40 seat aircraft powered by a pair of American-built Lycoming PLF1B-2 turbofan engines. During this time, the West German industry underwent a substantial reorganisation, resulting in the establishment of Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), based at Bremen, Germany. Development of what would become the VFW 614 proceeded under the new combined company.Mellberg 1995, pp. 94‚Äì95. Lycoming ultimately chose to abandon development of the PLF1, which led to development of the type continuing using an alternative powerplant, the Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H turbofan engine, in its place. Unlike the PLF1, the M45H was developed specially to power the VFW 614. At the time, it was considered to have been a relatively bold ambition to develop both an entirely new airframe and a new engine in parallel. Throughout development, a major priority placed upon the engines was upon noise reduction, so as to allow the airliner to use small municipal airports without incurring noise abatement restrictions upon its operations. In 1968, the project was given the go-ahead;Mellberg 1995, p. 95. at this point, 80 percent of the secured backing for the type originated from the West German Government. During 1970, full-scale production of the VFW 614 was approved, by which time VFW had merged with Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker, a move which had the distinction of being Europe's first transnational aircraft company.Mendenhall 2005, pp. 325‚Äì326. Aerospace publication Flying Magazine accredits Fokker's involvement in the project with several refinements and changes to the emerging design of the VFW 614, which included the discarding of a T-tail in favour of a conventional unit, furnished with a low-set vertical stabilizer and dihedral.Fricker, John. \\"Ach du Leiber Flugindustrie.\\" Flying Magazine, May 1966. Vol. 78, No. 5. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 77. During this time, Fokker sought to broaden its financial basis and determined that the VFW 614 had promise; as such, the company intended to market the type through Fokker's established civil sales unit and support infrastructure; however, the union has been regarded by some commentators as having been an 'unhappy arrangement' and had only lasted for only ten years before its dissolution. In addition, several risk sharing agreements had been concluded with other aviation companies, including Siebel Flugzeugwerke ATG (SEAT) in Germany, Fairey and SABCA in Belgium and Shorts in the United Kingdom. Final assembly of the aircraft was to be performed at VFW's Bremen facility. Development of the aircraft had been heavily influenced by the pre- war American piston-engine Douglas DC-3 passenger aircraft. During late 1971, it was reported that the company had anticipated overall sales of the VFW 614 airliner to eventually reach between 300 and 400 units, which was to have included its use by various American operators. On 14 July 1971, the first of three prototypes performed its maiden flight.Mellberg 1995, pp. 95, 98. The first flight of the aircraft was also the first time that the engine had been airborne, having not been previously flown on a flying test-bed.Field 1974, p. 489. To speed up flight testing, the first and second prototypes, which were reportedly almost identical, were dispatched to Spain for three months of comprehensive trials to evaluate their performance under 'hot and high' conditions.Field 1974, p. 490. Shortly after the accumulation of 800 flying hours, the design was frozen for production and manufacturing activity commenced on the first ten production airliners. Development of the aircraft was protracted and orders slow to materialise, despite a strong marketing campaign. The situation was not helped by Rolls-Royce's bankruptcy in 1971 which threatened the supply of engines. However, according to aircraft publication Flight International, by 1974, the performance guarantees on both the thrust and fuel consumption of the M45H had been fulfilled. On 1 February 1972, the programme was damaged by the loss of the first prototype, which was attributed to an instance of elevator flutter;Mellberg 1995, p. 98. which played a role in further diminishing the order situation. By late 1974, orders had been placed for the long-lead items to complete an anticipated 30 production VFW-614s, along with sufficient critical items to build up to 50 airliners. By February 1975, only ten aircraft had been ordered. During April 1975, the first production VFW 614 made its first flight; it was delivered to Denmark's Cimber Air four months later. Design VFW 614 inflight from above The VFW-Fokker 614 was a twin-engined short haul regional airliner; it was developed as in part to serve as a replacement for the popular propeller- driven pre-war Douglas DC-3. The 614 was the first passenger jetliner to be developed by West Germany, and featured an unconventional engine configuration. In its era, the aircraft was one of the smallest and slowest airliners to have been produced.Gunston, Bill. \\"The Phoenix of Derby.\\" New Scientist, 9 December 1971. Vol. 52, No. 773. ISSN 0262-4079. p. 77. The VFW 614 was powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H turbofan engines; this powerplant, being both relatively quiet and smokeless, had been specially developed to power the airliner. In addition, for further internal noise reduction, soundproofing was present within the cabin.Field 1974, pp. 489‚Äì490. These engines were installed on the airliner via an unconventional manner, having been mounted above the wings upon pylons at a mid-wing position.Eriksson and Steenhuis 2015, pp. 121‚Äì122. This arrangement had several advantages, such as avoiding the structural weight penalties imposed by rear-mounted engines and the potential ingestion risks present when engines were mounted low down underneath the wings. The engine configuration allowed the adoption of a short, sturdy undercarriage, which was specially suited to performing operations from austere or otherwise poorly-prepared runways. The position of the engine over the wing, compared to under-wing, also shielded people on the ground from intake noise during flyovers; this shielding effect is also present for aft-mounted engines. In conjunction with the above-wing engine installation, an unswept wing outfitted with a continuous trailing edge flap was also adopted; this possessed no unfavourable interaction with the engine flow.Kocivar, Ben. \\".\\" Popular Science, October 1971. p. 67. The continuous flap gave excellent low speed performance, however, during high speed travel, interference between the wing and pylon flow fields resulted in flow separation, which in turn limited the cruise speed to M0.65.\\"Engine/Airframe Interference.\\" G. Krenz, AGARD R-712, Special Course on Subsonic/Transonic Aerodynamic Interference for Aircraft, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton Ohio, 16‚Äì20 May 1983. A recent aircraft, the HondaJet, which also featured an over-wing engine installation, used a high speed natural laminar flow airfoil and an engine configuration that actually produced favorable interference at high speed.Garrison, Peter. \\"Technicalities: You want to put them where?\\" Flying Magazine, December 2005. Vol. 132, No. 12. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 105. The flight deck of the VFW 614 was designed to facilitate easy two- crew operations. The flight crew are provided with a large windscreen, providing favourable external visibility, and a relatively spacious environment. Instead of using side-mounted consoles, a large centrally-mounted console accommodates the primary engine controls and VHF com/nav radio systems, along with the individual controls for adjusting the spoilers, flaps, and trimming. Avionics included a Collins-built flight director, autopilot, and a pilot alerting system. According to Flight International, the VFW 614 possessed relatively docile and easy to handle flight tendencies, along with light controls, favourable aileron characteristics and a high rate of roll.Field 1974, pp. 491‚Äì492. One negative flight performance attribute was its stall characteristics, which was described as initially occurring \\"at almost the worst possible place ‚Äì the inboard end of the ailerons\\". The stalling regime was explored heavily during the flight test programme, which led to a re-profiling of the wing's leading edge for additional outboard camber being adopted on production aircraft to improve this performance, giving greater warning and a tendency for relatively straight flight during typical stall conditions.Field 1974, p. 491.  Operational history  At Cimber Air in 1977 Shortly after the VFW 614's entry to service, it had become clear that sales had fallen far short of expectations. According to author Mark E. Mendenhall, the management within VFW-Fokker was divided and split along national lines; while a number of German figures within the company attributed the poor sales performance to the Dutch sales team having paid the type little heed, even allegedly regarding it as a competitor to Fokker's established product lines for orders, and that salesmen had prioritised the promotion of Dutch-designed airliners instead. Reportedly, some Dutch managers did hold a preference for their own aircraft, regarding them as established successes and the VFW 614 as a waste of effort to market; furthermore, Dutch management was alleged by Mendenhall to have interfered with the firm's marketing structure to curtail independence and maintain support for their own aircraft. West German airline Lufthansa declined to procure any VFW 614s; at the time the company had prioritised its development of long haul routes, for which regional airliners were not applicable, while the German government had declined to pressure the airline to buy the type. According to authors H. Dienel and P. Lyth, Lufthansa's lack of interest in the type was attributed as having been a major factor in the commercial failure of the VFW 614.Dienel and Lyth 1999, pp. 97‚Äì98. Only three airlines and the German Air Force would ultimately operate new VFW 614s.Jackson 1976, p. 62. The aircraft was initially prone to engine problems, and it was too expensive for the small regional airlines for whose needs it was designed.Mellberg 1995, pp. 98‚Äì99. Three aircraft were flown but were never delivered; a total of four airframes were broken up prior to completion. ATTAS used to visualize wingtip vortices During 1977, the programme was officially cancelled as a result of the lack of sales, and the last unsold aircraft flew in July 1978. Mendenhall reports that there had been a widespread sentiment amongst German employees that they had been regarded as being subordinate to Fokker, which had increased over time as the VFW 614's commercial failure had become more and more apparent.Mendenhall 2005, p. 332. By 1981, the majority of commercial aircraft had already been disposed of, partially due to the manufacturer having bought back many of the aircraft that year in order that it could simultaneously terminate support for the type. Thereafter, only the German Air Force aircraft remained in service, the last being retired in 1999. The last airworthy VFW 614 was in use with DLR for the Advanced Technologies Testing Aircraft System (ATTAS) project. After being based with DLR in Braunschweig, Germany for many years, this aircraft (registered D-ADAM) was retired in December 2012, to the Deutsches Museum Flugwerft in Oberschlei√üheim, Germany.

The Thames Conservancy (formally the Conservators of the River Thames) was a historical body responsible for the management of the River Thames in England. It was founded in 1857, initially replacing the jurisdiction of the City of London up to Staines and later taking responsibility for the whole river from Cricklade in Wiltshire to the sea at Yantlet Creek on the Isle of Grain. Responsibilities were reduced when the Tideway was transferred to the Port of London Authority in 1909 and in 1974 the Conservancy was taken into the Thames Water Authority. History =Background= The Victoria Embankment under construction in 1865 The stretch of river between the town of Staines, just to the west of London, and Yantlet Creek had been claimed by the City of London since 1197 under a charter of Richard the Lionheart. The jurisdiction was marked by the London Stones. In 1771 the Thames Navigation Commission was established from a body created twenty years earlier to handle navigation on the river. Although the commissioners were active in establishing locks and weirs above Staines, they did not interfere with the jurisdiction of the City of London. The City of London Corporation built a series of locks from Teddington to Penton Hook at the beginning of the nineteenth century. They also used material from the demolished Old London Bridge to support the embankments between Sunbury and Shepperton. However trouble arose around 1840 when the government proposed building the Victoria Embankment and the Crown claimed title to the river bed. The dispute simmered on for 17 years. Meanwhile, as a result of competition from the railways, the volume of traffic on the river had been drastically reduced. Income from tolls fell from ¬£16,000 in 1839 to less than ¬£8,000 in 1849, while maintenance charges for 1850 were estimated at nearly ¬£7,000. The City's unwillingness to pay for necessary expenditure led to complaints. By the Thames Conservancy Act 1857, the Crown reclaimed its rights and transferred it to the new body. =First Conservancy (1857)= The City of London handed its inventory to the Thames Conservancy in October 1857. In June 1857 the first stone of a new lock at Teddington had been laid at the present position, being the central of the three locks. The conservancy opened it in 1858 together with the narrow skiff lock, (known as \\"the coffin\\"). and the conservancy soon imposed regulations. In 1858 a toll of 15 shillings was imposed on every steam vessel passing Teddington Lock, and a speed limit set to five miles per hour. This was amended to 5 mph with the stream and 4 mph against it. Netting from Richmond to Staines was prohibited forever. The new authority reaffirmed the rights of anglers against interference from landowners and received a notice from the water bailiff drawing attention to the \\"improper practice of letting boats for hire to inexperienced persons\\". At this time the management of the bulk of the upstream river was the responsibility of the Thames Navigation Commissioners, but this changed in 1866. =Second Conservancy (1866)= In 1866 it was considered expedient to put the navigation of the whole of the river under one management It was said that the Thames Commissioners were too numerous, the locks and weirs on the River Thames were in a bad condition and income was insufficient to pay for maintenance. It was believed that under single management with the upper river maintained properly and with lower tolls overall the traffic would increase. On 6 August 1866, the Thames Navigation Act 1866 allowed the Thames Conservancy to take over management of the river from Cricklade to Yantlet Creek, a distance of 177 miles (285 km). Mapledurham Watermill was one of the 28 mills still operating in 1866 The waterworks buildings at Hampton Under the act, all locks canals and other works of the commissioners were transferred to the conservancy. In addition provision was made for all weirs to be transferred to the Conservancy from private owners. Former owners of weirs were freed from liability but two weirs at Buscot and Eaton remained to the owner of Buscot Park. Most weirs belonged to the twenty eight water-mills still operating between Oxford and Staines and the entitlement to water of the mills, many of which dated back to Domesday Book, was recognised. No new flow of sewage into the river or its tributaries was allowed and existing sewage works were to be removed. New revenue was raised by a ¬£1,000 per annum charge on each of the five water companies. The Southwark and Vauxhall, Grand Junction and West Middlesex water companies had set up their works at Hampton in the 1850s after it became illegal to take water from the Tideway. The Lambeth and Chelsea water companies had moved initially to Seething Wells but later relocated to East Molesey. Whereas the City of London owned the river bed for its part of the river, the Thames Commissioners did not and hence Thames Conservancy did not acquire the ownership of the river bed for the section above Staines which remained (and remains) the property of the riparian owners. In August 1866 the conservancy inspected works between Oxford and Windsor and in October settled a table of tolls. Bell Weir Lock had collapsed in June and was rebuilt the following year. In 1868 tolls were placed on three of the four locks then above Oxford ‚Äì St John's, Buscot and Pinkhill Locks. Rushey Lock was omitted and there were no tolls on the weirs. This reflects the poor state of navigation above Oxford. Some of the old locks on the rest of the river were still wooden pens and these were gradually renewed or replaced. Works completed in 1869 included the rebuilding of Romney Lock and the addition of a boat slide at Teddington. In 1870 Hambleden Lock and Benson Lock were rebuilt, followed by Day's Lock in 1871 and Godstow Lock in 1872. In the 1870s it is recorded that Teddington weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage. In 1872 conservancy promised to reopen navigation between Radcot and Newbridge by repairing Rushey Lock but in 1874 recognised that they lacked the funds to meet the promise. There were regular complaints at this time about the poor state of river particularly in upper reaches and the persistence of sewage. Weir, mill and walkway at Hambleden Lock replacements continued with Shiplake and Cleeve in 1874, Caversham in 1875, Whitchurch in 1876 and Bell Weir in 1877. In 1883 the conservancy removed the lock at Chalmore Hole at Wallingford, after many years petitioning by residents of Wallingford for its retention. The weirs at Hambleden were built in 1884 and the public right of way across the river sustained by building the walkway. Bray Lock was rebuilt in 1885. The Thames Preservation Act 1885 was passed to enshrine the preservation of river for public recreation. It prohibited shooting on the river which had become a cause of concern. The act noted \\"It is lawful for all persons for pleasure or profit to travel or to loiter upon any and every part or the river\\" (apart from private cuts). The river had become exceedingly popular for sport and leisure. Many regattas or \\"aquatic fetes\\" had been instigated and Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat published in 1889 described a typical boating journey. Richmond Lock and Footbridge Lock replacements continued with Marsh in 1888, Temple in 1890 and Cookham in 1892 The first new lock was built at Radcot Lock in 1892, and Chertsey Lock was lengthened in 1893. A major work in 1894 was the Richmond Lock and weir complex built to ensure that there is always at least a depth of water in the river between Richmond and Teddington. A further Thames Conservancy Act was passed in 1894 which consisted mainly of tidying up legislation. The conservancy finally addressed navigation above Oxford replacing the existing weirs with locks and footbridges where there was a right of way. New locks were Grafton Lock and Northmoor Lock in 1896 and Shifford Lock in 1898. Also in 1898 the conservancy rebuilt Pinkhill and Rushey. Downstream, Boveney was rebuilt in 1898, with the old lock replaced by a boat slide and Shepperton was also rebuilt on a different alignment in 1899. By the end of the 19th century the advance in the size of ships and the growth of the Port of London raised questions of management and a Royal Commission reported in 1900 recommending that a single body take responsibility for the port. Meanwhile at Teddington, the barge lock, the largest lock on the river at , was built in 1904‚Äì1905. Locks rebuilt in 1905 included Abingdon, St Johns, Sonning and Osney. Molesey Lock was replaced in 1906 and Mapledurham Lock in 1908. =After separation of the Port of London Authority= Lord Desborough, long-serving chairman, took office in 1905 In 1908, the Port of London Act transferred responsibility for the Tideway including Richmond Lock to the Port of London Authority, which began its duties on 31 March 1909. A demarkation point set the authorities' shared boundary as that of the parishes of Teddington and Twickenham, with an obelisk below Teddington Lock: the Thames Conservancy remained responsible for the non-tidal river between Cricklade and Teddington. Lock rebuilds took place at Penton Hook in 1909 and Hurley in 1910. In 1912 the conservancy undertook major works at Boulter's Lock, which involved the purchase of Ray Mill Island. Chertsey Lock was lengthened in 1913 and Marsh Lock rebuilt in 1914. Goring Lock was rebuilt in 1921 with a third central set of gates and Godstow Lock rebuilt in 1924. In 1927 a new lock was built at Sunbury, the old one being retained. Marlow Lock and Iffley Lock were redeveloped in the same years. In 1928 the improvement to navigation above Oxford was finally completed with the building of Eynsham Lock and King's Lock. Desborough Cut The next significant undertaking was the digging of Desborough Cut between 1930 and 1935. The -mile (1 km) cut took the river on a straight course between Weybridge and Walton on Thames, and avoiding a meandering stretch past Shepperton and Lower Halliford. The cut alleviated flooding in Shepperton and halved the distance of travel on that part of the river. A Thames Conservancy Act 1932 dealt with construction of jetties and landing stages on the river.Thames Conservancy Act 1932 In the 1960s modernisation of the locks began with the first hydraulic system introduced at Shiplake Lock in 1961. Sandford Lock was rebuilt in 1972. =Governance= Significant change in the structure of the conservancy in the 20th century began with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930. This created catchment boards and drainage boards over much of England and Wales, but the Thames above Teddington was treated as a special case, as outlined in section 79 of that Act. The conservators automatically became a catchment board, and were required to carry out the drainage functions described in section 34 of the Act, although not until two years after the Act came into force. All the existing conservators had to resign, although they could be reappointed as part of the new regime. Schedule 6 contained a list of who was responsible for the appointment of the 31 new members, which consisted mostly of county councils and county borough councils, together with one appointed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, one by the Board of Trade and one by the Minister of Transport. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries could also appoint three additional members after consultation with internal drainage boards. The new conservators were required to keep separate accounts relating to their activities under the Act, and those relating to activities bestowed on them by various Conservancy Acts dating from 1894 to 1924. The River Boards Act 1948 replaced catchment boards with river boards, covering the whole of England and Wales, but again the Thames Conservancy was treated as a special case. The Act introduced new constitutional, financial and general administrative powers for the river boards, but the Thames Conservancy continued to operate under the 1930 legislation. The next change occurred with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1961, the provisions of which were applied to the Thames Conservancy, although the conservancy did not formally become a river authority in the way that other river boards did. Mention was made in the Act that the Thames Conservators derived some of their powers from the Thames Conservancy Acts of 1950 and 1959, rather than the River Boards Act. The Water Act 1973 abolished River Authorities, replacing them with ten regional water authorities, and on 1 April 1974, the Thames Conservancy was subsumed into the new Thames Water Authority, although much of the organisation remained intact as the authority's Thames Conservancy Division. However when Thames Water was privatised in 1990 as a result of the Water Act 1989, the river management functions passed to the new National Rivers Authority and in 1996 to the Environment Agency.

He studied under Thomas WiltonHarjeet Singh Gill, Signification in language and culture, Indian Institute of Advanced Study, 2002, p. 109. and received his Master of Arts degree in 1301, and was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford until about 1310. He then spent sixteen years in Paris, becoming a fellow of the Sorbonne by 1324, before spending 17 years as a clerical courtier in England and Avignon. Burley disagreed with William of Ockham on a number of points concerning logic and natural philosophy. He was known as the Doctor Planus and Perspicuus. Early life Burley was born in 1274 or 1275, possibly in Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire, or in Burley near Leeds. Little is known of his early life. He was made rector of Welbury in Yorkshire in 1309, probably through the influence of Sir John de Lisle, a friend of William Greenfield. As throughout his career, he did not act as rector, employing a substitute and using the income from the living to finance his study in Paris, where he completed his lectures on Peter Lombard's Sentences, and probably encountered the work of his contemporary William of Ockham. Burley's commentary on the Sentences has not survived. Political career Burley became a courtier during the political events that followed the deposition of Edward II of England in 1327. His first assignment was to try and obtain the canonisation of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, who had been one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Edward II; Thomas had become venerated as a martyr within a few months of his death. Burley was sent to the papal court at Avignon to appeal directly to Pope John XXII. By coincidence, William of Ockham was also staying at Avignon, having been summoned there in 1324 to answer charges of possibly heretical statements (by 1326 there was a list of 51 charges against him). Burley's associates were all closely involved in these attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful). One was Richard de Bury, a bibliophile and patron of the arts and sciences, who became Burley's patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of Aristotle into English. Ecclesiastical career Burley had become a master of theology by 1324. In May 1327 he became canon of Chichester by the provision of the pope, but exchanged the position in 1332 to become canon at Wells, where de Bury was dean. Bury had been involved in the coup d'√©tat of 1330 that resulted in the execution of Mortimer, and the de facto accession of Edward III to the throne. In 1333 de Bury was consecrated Bishop of Durham by the king, over- ruling the choice of the monks, who had elected and actually installed their sub-prior, Robert de Graynes.Fryde Handbook of British Chronology p. 242 In February 1334 de Bury was made Lord Treasurer, an appointment he exchanged later in the year for that of Lord Chancellor. He gathered together a group of intellectuals including Thomas Fitzralph, Richard de Kilvington, Robert Holcott, Thomas Bradwardine and Burley himself. Walter may have been a relative of his younger contemporary Adam Burley. Philosophical work Burley was one of the first medieval logicians to recognize the priority of the propositional calculus over the term logic,Laurent Cesalli, \\"Meaning and Truth\\", in A. D. Conti (ed.), A Companion to Walter Burley, Leiden: Brill, 2013, p. 92. despite the fact that the latter had been the main focus of logicians until then. Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the material conditional, the principle that \\"from the impossible anything follows\\" (\\"ex impossibili sequitur quodlibet\\") is both a necessary and sufficient condition for explaining the logical relationship between antecedent and consequent. He was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's Physics, which include the quodlibet De Primo et ultimo instanti (around 1320) and the longer work Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu. Burley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited) Marta Vittorini, Appendix: A Complete List of Burley's Works, in A. D.

Biography  Schwenter was born in Nuremberg. He was professor of oriental languages and mathematics at the University of Altdorf. This is achieved by a preface written by Schwenter in the book Kurtzer, gr√ºndtlicher, warhaffter, gebesserter und vermehrter Underricht, Zuberaitung und Gebrauch de√ü Circkels, Schregme√ü und Linial from George Galgemair and by an old chronicle of the University of Altdorf.Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit.

Among other topics, Geometriae practicae covers the art of baculometry - the measuring of inaccessible distances via staves. As a linguist, Schwenter was familiar with Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and Aramaic. He was also an authority on Euclid. He died in Altdorf bei N√ºrnberg.  Schwenter and the Scioptric Ball  A diagram showing the various angles of cut of a cone required to produce a parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse. From Schwenter's Geometriae practicae novae et auctae tractatus. He is credited with developing the scioptric ball in 1636. This is a universal joint that allows a microscope, mounted on the ball, to be swiveled into any position. Its invention was inspired by Schwenter's studies of the human eye. The scioptric ball provided a firm anchor for a microscope or telescope while allowing the telescope to be swiveled in all directions in order to follow the course of an eclipse or for drawing panoramic views. The microscope or telescope passes through the center of the ball, the essential function being similar to that of the ball (or pan-and- tilt) head on a modern photographer's tripod.  Schwenter and the Fountain Pen  Deliciae physico-mathematicae, 1636 Schwenter did not invent the fountain pen, but in 1636, in his Deliciae Physic-Mathematicae, he described a pen made in two parts, using portions of seven quills. One part served as a reservoir for ink and included the writing point. The second part provided the pen body (a full-length feather) and served as a plug in the back end of the first part. The ink was sealed inside first part by the second. Squeezing the pen forced ink to flow through a small hole in one of the first part's quill fragments and from there to the writing point.

Early life William Stewart, born on 10 January 1774, was the fourth (second surviving) son of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway (1736‚Äì1806), and his second wife, Anne (1742/3‚Äì1830), daughter of Sir James Dashwood, 2nd Baronet. Charles James Stewart the second Bishop of Quebec, was his younger brother. Member of Parliament He represented Saltash in Cornwall from 1795 to 1796, Wigtownshire 1796‚Äì1802, the Wigtown Burghs 1803‚Äì1805 and Wigtownshire again 1812‚Äì1816. Early military success Stewart entered the British Army in 1786 as a twelve-year-old Ensign in the 42nd Foot. His first active service was in the West Indies Campaign of 1793‚Äì94, where he was wounded. After further service in the West Indies, when he commanded the 67th Foot at San Domingo (1796‚Äì98), Stewart returned to Europe and was given permission to serve with Britain's Austrian and Russian allies in Italy, Swabia and Switzerland during the campaign of 1799. Stewart was intensely interested in weapons and tactics. It was probably his observations in 1799 of 'light infantry' and Tyrolese and Croat soldiers that did not fight in the rigid formations adopted by normal infantry units that led him to propose that the British Army should include a permanent force of 'light infantry', equipped with rifles. His ideas won support, especially from the influential Equerry to the King, Colonel Coote Manningham, who Stewart had first met in the West Indies. In March 1800 an experimental 'Corps of Riflemen' was established. In August Stewart commanded it at the amphibious attack on Ferrol, where he was severely wounded in the chest as he led his riflemen up the cliffs. In October 1800 the Corps was gazetted as an established unit, with Manningham as colonel and Stewart as its first lieutenant-colonel and commanding officer. Stewart's Standing Orders for the Rifle Corps, which later became the famous 95th Foot (Rifle Brigade), show how advanced his tactical thinking was compared to that of his contemporaries. He devised and implemented specially adapted forms of drill and manoeuvre, medals for bravery and good conduct, classification in shooting ability, a school and a library for the soldiers, while requiring every Rifles officer to get to know each of his men as individuals. Shortly after Stewart's twenty- seventh birthday he was appointed to command the 895 soldiers (114 from the Rifle Corps and 781 from the 49th Regiment) that were to serve as marines in the fleet sent to the Baltic in 1801. He was stationed on the quarter-deck of Admiral Nelson's flagship HMS Elephant throughout the great naval Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. Nelson reported that \\"The Honourable Colonel Stewart did me the favour to be aboard the Elephant; and himself, with every officer and soldier under his orders, shared with pleasure the toils and dangers of the day\\" (Stewart's detachment lost 4 dead and 6 wounded). Stewart was chosen for the honour of carrying to London the despatches reporting the victory and was included by name in the Thanks of Parliament voted on 16 April 1801. Six days later he received an official letter of promotion to full colonel, effective from the day of the Battle of Copenhagen. Nelson wrote to Lord St Vincent praising \\"Colonel Stewart, who is an excellent and indefatigable young man, and depend upon it, the rising hope of our army\\". Nelson wrote at least eleven letters to Stewart in the four years between Copenhagen and his death at Trafalgar, which were included in the collection of Stewart's papers privately published as \\"The Cumloden Papers\\". In 1802 the Rifle Corps was redesignated as the 95th (Rifle) Regiment and together with the 43rd and 52nd Foot was formed into the famous Light Brigade commanded by Sir John Moore. Stewart was the first colonel of the 95th, but soon had to hand over its operational command when he was appointed to be a brigadier- general. Stewart's heart still lay with the Rifles, and in 1805 he published \\"Outlines of a Plan for the General Reform of the British Land Forces\\", which advocated general adoption of many of the innovations he had already made within the 95th. Stewart held important commands in the expeditions to Egypt in 1807 and to Walcheren in 1809, before being sent to Spain in 1810. Although Stewart was still junior as a major-general, he was given the crucial task of commanding the besieged garrison of the vital port of Cadiz and initially put directly under the orders of General Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. This led to an appointment to command a brigade in the Second Division of the army in the Peninsula, and in December 1810 Stewart took over as commander of Second Division. Division commander under Wellington At the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, Stewart led the all-British 2nd Division, which bore the brunt of Marshal Nicolas Soult's flank attack. He wheeled Lieut-Col John Colborne's brigade to attack the left flank of Soult's massive French column. At first, the manoeuvre went well, as British musketry savaged the French infantry. Suddenly attacked from flank and rear by mounted Polish lancers and French hussars, three of Colborne's regiments were massacred, losing 1,250 men; only 400 escaped. At that battle, Stewart's other two brigades also suffered severely from point-blank French cannon and musket fire, but this was not his fault. In an epic struggle, the survivors of his division held back the French until the 4th Division saved the day. Glover, historian of the Peninsular War, wrote, \\"As a battalion commander, Stewart was surpassed only by Moore; as a general he was a menace\\".. Wellington wrote of him, \\"It is necessary that Stewart should be under the particular charge of somebody\\".. After Albuera, Wellington found that \\"somebody\\" in the person of Lieutenant- General Rowland Hill. For the rest of the Peninsular War, Stewart and his 2nd Division usually served under Hill's competent supervision. He fought in Hill's corps in the Burgos campaign in the fall of 1812 and at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. On 15 November 1812, Soult's 80,000 Frenchmen confronted Wellington's 65,000 Anglo-Portuguese near Salamanca. When Soult failed to attack, Wellington ordered a withdrawal to Portugal. During the retreat, Stewart (temporarily in charge of the 1st Division) and two other division commanders disobeyed their commander's orders. Stewart, Wellington wrote, \\"and certain other generals held a Council of War to decide whether to obey my orders to march by a particular road. He [Stewart], at the head, decided they would not; they marched by a road leading they knew not where, and when I found them in the morning they were in the utmost confusion, not knowing where to go and what to do\\".. On the opening day of the Battle of the Pyrenees at Maya Pass, Stewart concluded that the French would not attack, then rode ten miles to the rear. When the battle began, his 2nd Division was left to fight all morning under an inexperienced brigade commander and lost 1,347 men.. Still in Hill's corps, Stewart fought at the battles of the Nive, Orthez and Toulouse during Wellington's 1814 invasion of southern France. Awards, thanks and retirement For his services in the Peninsula Stewart received the Gold Cross with two clasps, the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword, and the Spanish Order of San Fernando. On 2 January 1815 (on the enlargement of the order of the Bath) he received the G.C.B. Stewart had been M.P. for Saltash in 1795, and for Wigtonshire from 1796 onward, and on 24 June 1814 the speaker thanked him in his place, on behalf of the house, for his share in the victories of Vittoria and Orthes, and in the intermediate operations. Stewart saw no further service. His health was broken by seventeen campaigns, in which he had received six wounds and four contusions, and in 1816 he resigned his seat in parliament. In July 1818 he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 1st Battalion of what had then become the Rifle Brigade. He settled at Cumloden on the borders of Wigton and Kirkcudbrightshire, near the family seat. He died there on 7 January 1827, and was buried at Minigaff. Family In 1804 Stewart married Frances, daughter of the Hon. John Douglas (second son of the Earl of Morton), and he left one son, Horatio, a captain in the Rifle Brigade, and one daughter, Louisa.

The film is about a run-down hospital where a doctor's mistake unwittingly creates horrific consequences for the staff at the hospital. The film was adapted from Ochiai's earlier screenplay from Tales of the Unusual. On its release, the film was part of the six-volume J-Horror Theater series. On the film's release in Japan, it was the second highest gross film at the weekend box office, only being beaten by the film I Robot. Plot At a run-down, understaffed hospital, Dr. Akiba refuses to admit a patient with a strange black rash and is alerted to a serious crisis in Room 3 where a burnt victim dies, having apparently been given the wrong drug. Akiba, Dr. Uozumi, and four nurses decide to cover up the cause of death and move the body to an unused room. The head nurse then discovers that the patient that Akiba previously refused to admit has been left in the hallway and informs him. However, when Akiba goes to check, he discovers that Doctor Akai had taken the patient and decides to study his symptoms: though he is still alive, his body mass is liquefying into green goo. Not knowing how much Akai knows about the events in Room 3, Akiba and the others reluctantly agree to help with the examination but when they return to the patient's room, they find he has vanished and the head nurse unconscious. The head nurse awakens and begins acting strangely while she starts to bleed green goo from both her ears and eyes. The doctors realise they are at risk of infection and decide to put her on a bed and cover her with plastic in an attempt to limit the infection's spread. Soon after, the mean nurse finds the young nurse drawing blood on herself. Their conversation goes awry, when the young nurse lets out a maniacal laughs and plunges two needles into her body, splattering the mean nurse with green goo. While speaking with a patient he killed earlier, Uozumi is overcome with emotional guilt. Akiba walks in, but finds Uozumi alone. His eyes turn white and green goo starts seeping from him. Akiba panics and turns to find the mean nurse, now infected and covered in green goo, smiling and hanging upside down from the ceiling. After finding the nurse giving her own blood to the dead burn patient and running into the infected head nurse, Akiba flees the room. Akiba confronts Akai and accuses him of creating and spreading the virus. Akai denies this and explains that the infection is actually spread mentally, infecting the subconscious of its victims. He then urges Akiba to remember what really happened in Room 3 earlier in the night. Dr. Nakazono walks in to find Akiba talking to himself, forcing him to realize that he's been speaking with his reflection. He looks around and sees the corpses of the two nurses who are dead and covered in blood with no green goo in sight. Soon, Dr. Nakazono realizes that the last few hours have all been a hallucination. Nakazono calls the police, as Akiba recalls the events in Room 3 and realizes that \\"Akai\\" was actually the burn patient. The same series of events is shown again, but with Akiba as the burn patient and Akai as Akiba, giving the order for the wrong drug, which massacres the entire staff. The hospital is evacuated the next morning as all of the staff, except Nakazono, are dead and the police is searching for Akiba who has disappeared. When Nakazono leaves the hospital, she sees all the red lights change to green and vice versa; panicking, she accidentally cuts her hand and green blood pours out. A shot of a locker is seen in the room where the burn victim was kept. Someone inside the locker is calling for help as green goo starts pouring out of it. The top of the locker opens and Akiba's hand covered in goo reaches out before falling to the floor.  Cast  K≈çichi Sat≈ç starred in the film as Dr. Akiba Cast adapted from the book The Toho Filmography. Production The film was part of Taka Ichise's announcement from May 14, 2004 where he announced his help in the creation of Entertainment FARM, which was the first Japanese company to provide financial backing for films. The company operated like an investment firm, focusing exclusively on films. Among their first productions, was Takashige Ichise's J-Horror Theater series, which Infection was part of. The series was a list of free-standing horror films directed by Masayuki Ochiai, Norio Tsuruta, Takashi Shimizu, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Hideo Nakata and Hiroshi Takahashi. Ochiai wrote the screenplay for Infection, which is an adaptation of one of his early scripts for a segment from Tales of the Unusual. Infection began production in April 2004.  Release  Infection was released theatrically in Japan on October 2, 2004 where it was distributed by Toho. The film was released as a double feature with Premonition in Japan. In the film's opening week in Japan, it was the second highest film in the box office being only beaten by I, Robot. It grossed a total of $1,320,123 in its first week. The film grossed a total of $6,609,556 in Japan. In the United States, the film was released directly to DVD by Lions Gate Films Home Entertainment on May 17, 2005. Reception The Japan Times stated that Infection will \\"look familiar to J Horror fans\\" and resembled an episodes of The X-Files without Scully and Mulder. The review concluded that the director \\"stresses Grand Guignol atmospherics more, rational-sounding explanations less. His hospital breathes with a menace, madness and despair so pervasive that only a huge, obliterating explosion could bring escape -- in this life, at least.\\" David Kalat (Video Watchdog) referred to the film as \\"a claustrophobic chamber piece\\" and \\"an overwhelming sensory experience that employs every cinematic trick in Ochiai's repertoire to establish a tone of intense dread.\\" Sight & Sound gave the film a mixed review, opining that \\"after a fairly engrossing trawl through horror conventions, the film takes a reckless plunge into oneiric ambiguity that fails to provide satisfying closure\\" Sean Plummer writing in Rue Morgue stated that Infection \\"gets a bit messy towards the end\\" as \\"a major plot twist makes suspension of disbelief difficult\\" concluding that the film's \\"take on how a virus is transmitted is pretty original.\\" See also * List of horror films of 2004 * List of Japanese films of 2004  References  =Footnotes= =Sources=   External links   Category:2004 films Category:2004 horror films Category:Films directed by Masayuki Ochiai Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese films Category:Films about viral outbreaks Category:J-Horror Theater Category:Fiction about murder Category:Nikkatsu films Category:Toho films ","title":"Infection (2004 film)"},{"id":"3909562","text":"Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet (18 November 1753 ‚Äì 21 March 1825) was a British Tory politician.

Previously the audio director for Cyan software company that produced the Myst series of computer games. Before working at Valve, he worked at Cyan, working as a sound designer for Riven, and as a composer for realMyst, Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages. He has 23 years experience in the game audio industry. He started in the game industry working as a composer/sound designer for Broderbund. He created sound design for Riven while working there and was later hired at Cyan to work on realMyst and Uru. Tim still performs session work regularly as a trumpet player as well as doing freelance sound design and composition outside Cyan. He created music and sound design for titles such as Middle-earth, The Incredibles, Pariah, The Lord of the Rings, and Prince of Persia. He won the Academy Award for sound design at the 75th Academy Awards for his work on the Sony Imageworks animated short film, The ChubbChubbs!. In the 2000s, Larkin was hired by Valve and worked on a number of their games, including Team Fortress 2, Portal, Portal 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and Artifact. Tim's experience in the music industry includes live performances as a trumpet player with artists Natalie Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Mel Torm√©, Sheila E and Huey Lewis. He recorded on record albums for Ice-T and as a solo artist for Avenue Jazz. He worked on HBO's The Rat Pack, White Mile and Floundering. He has done the trumpet work for the documentaries National Geographic's Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal, Pearl Harbor and The White House, and American Experience documentaries on Galileo and the Wright Brothers.  URU  Urus music was composed by Tim Larkin, who had started his career at game publisher Br√∏derbund, and lobbied hard to be included on Rivens development team. Larkin worked on creating different sound effects for Riven and was chosen to score Uru after composer and Myst co-creator Robyn Miller left Cyan in early 1998. The music for the game was collected as a soundtrack, Uru Music, that was released in 2003. Larkin chose the instrumentation for each track based on the various digital environments in the game. When the player is in the game's representation of New Mexico, for example, Larkin used a resonator guitar and flutes, creating what he called something \\"indigenous to a southwest type of feel that's very contemporary\\". In other areas Larkin described the game's music as being \\"less typical than you would find in most games\\" because of the exotic landscape the developers had created. To create contemporary and exotic types of music in the game, Larkin employed a combination of real and synthesized instruments. Sometimes Larkin replaced synthesized performances with those of real musicians, as in the track \\"Gallery Theme\\", where a synthesized vocal part was eventually discarded in favor of soprano Tasha Koontz. To create an exotic feel, Larkin used a group of Maasai tribesmen's chanting, who were recorded during their visit to Spokane, Washington, where Cyan Worlds was located at that time. The Uru soundtrack received two Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) nominations in 2004‚Äîone for \\"Best Original Vocal Song (Choral)\\" for the \\"Gallery Theme\\" (which won), and another for \\"Best Original Soundtrack.\\" Beyond its use in Uru, \\"Gallery Theme\\" was later used in the theatrical trailer for Steven Spielberg's film, Munich. The Uru soundtrack comes on an enhanced CD, containing a (nearly) four-minute music video called \\"Uru: The Makers\\" and an audio-only interview with Rand Miller and Tim Larkin.

There has been a castle on the site since the 14th century, although the present building was remodelled in the 18th and 19th centuries. Balnagown is the ancestral home of the Chiefs of Clan Ross, although since the 1970s it has been owned by the Egyptian-born businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed. The castle is protected as a category B listed building, and the grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History In the early 14th century, a castle was begun at Balnagown by Hugh, Mormaer (Earl) of Ross. Hugh was husband of Maud, sister of King Robert the Bruce, although after Hugh's death in 1333, his family lost royal favour and their lands were forfeit. Balnagown was acquired by a stepson of Hugh in 1375 who expanded the estate, a process which continued over the following centuries. On 11 November 1501 James IV was entertained by the laird's harper.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 125. In 1585 Alexander Ross, 9th laird of Balnagown, was outlawed, as was his son George. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, David Ross, 12th of Balnagown, fought for King Charles II at the Battle of Worcester (1651), although he was captured and died in the Tower of London. The 13th laird, another David, married Anne, daughter of James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray, in 1666. David and Anne rebuilt Balnagown, as attested by a datestone of 1672 on the castle, although they left no heir, and the estate passed to the Rosses of Halkhead in 1711. In 1754, Balnagown passed to another branch of the family, when it was inherited by Admiral Sir John Lockhart-Ross, 6th Baronet. The admiral spent much time and money improving the Balnagown estate, becoming \\"the most efficient and enterprising Highland estate manager of his day.\\" His son and heir Sir Charles Lockhart-Ross consulted James Gillespie Graham on Gothic Revival style alterations to the castle, and Italian gardens were laid out. Sir Charles Ross, 9th Baronet, inherited in 1911. He continued the tradition of agricultural improvement, introducing the silo and the combine harvester to the estate. He also invented the Ross rifle, which he had manufactured in Canada. To prevent the seizure of Balnagown by the Inland Revenue, Ross had the estate declared a ward of the court of Delaware, and he was subsequently unable to return to Britain for fear of imprisonment. From his death in 1942, until 1972, the castle was unoccupied and became dilapidated. In 1972, it was purchased by Mohamed Al-Fayed, who began restoration of the house and grounds.

On 24 April 2008, M√§kel√§ returned to his former club HJK Helsinki on an initial three- month loan deal. On 22 July 2008, it was confirmed by Hearts that M√§kel√§ had returned from his successful loan spell with HJK Helsinki, in which he scored seven goals in 13 games, and would immediately join his teammates for pre- season training in Germany.

While vocalist Jimmy Gestapo remains the only founding member of the band, the line-up has consisted of numerous musicians who have performed with a selection of musical acts across multiple genres, such as Skinnerbox, Danzig, The Bouncing Souls, Mucky Pup, Dog Eat Dog, Hanoi Rocks, Agnostic Front, Warzone, Cro-Mags, D Generation, New York Dolls, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, The Slackers, Thursday, Skavoovie and the Epitones, and Glen Campbell. Over the course of their career, Murphy's Law have released five full-length albums, the last of which was released in 2001. History =Murphy's Law and Back with a Bong (1986‚Äì1990)= The eponymous debut album features fast-paced, short songs with more mosh sections, but they also managed to blend in some laid-back Californian punk sounds and even blues into the stomping New York hardcore anthems. Some of the songs on this album could also be credited as an influence on the burgeoning thrash metal scene which had taken to incorporating elements of New York hardcore into their sound and general song structure ‚Äì for instance, Anthrax and S.O.D., whose Speak English or Die album (even being released a year before the actual registration of Murphy's Law eponymous) predated this release. They shared a common interest in the lyrical themes of drinking, smoking, and partying with the likes of Boston hardcore band, Gang Green ‚Äì another trait which separates them from the sociopolitical leanings of fellow NYHC bands. On later albums they diversified with experiments into ska. The album spawned a few live favorites which were devised to \\"get the party going\\" ‚Äì \\"Fun\\", \\"Beer\\", and \\"Care Bear\\" being just a small selection ‚Äì but it also had a track which caused some controversy with \\"Skinhead Rebel\\". It was seen by some sectors of the community as a fascist infused song. The album also includes a cover version of Iggy Pop's \\"I Got A Right\\". Back with a Bong was released in 1989 on Profile Records and subsequently re-released on Another Planet Records in 1994 with the previous self-titled album on the same disc. It came three years after the previous album and the band had undergone somewhat of a transformation with Jimmy Gestapo the only remaining member. Alex Morris had been replaced on guitar by Todd Youth ‚Äì previously of fellow New York City hardcore bands, Agnostic Front and Warzone, and later of Danzig. Chuck Valle replaced Pete Martinez on bass, and Doug E. Beans took over drumming duties from Petey Hines. In 1989, Murphy's Law opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their Mother's Milk tour. =The Best of Times (1991‚Äì1992)= Murphy's Law ushered in the '90s with a reinvigorated blast of their debauchery-laced brand of comedic punk. Stylistically, Murphy's Law made quite a jump on The Best of Times. The band did dabble in skacore long before it exploded, but was always pretty much a flat-out hardcore unit in the '80s. The Best of Times finds Jimmy Gestapo and friends combining funk, reggae, ska, and hardcore into their own distinct brew, shedding any dogmatic restrictions applied to the standards of their genre in the '80s. Production by Fishbone's John \\"Norwood\\" Fisher and Philip \\"Fish\\" Fisher lends authenticity and diversity to The Best of Times, as does the added instrumentation by several members of Fishbone. Covers of James Brown and Stevie Wonder provide some insight into Murphy's Law's sometimes controversial and misunderstood affiliation with the skinhead faction, finally putting to rest any allegations that racism or fascism have anything to do with the band's outlook. Although the group manages to shed this stereotype and expand musically on The Best of Times, the subject matter doesn't otherwise stray too far from earlier work. Songs about pot, beer, girls, and cars showcase the glorious immaturity and quest for fun that pretty much define Murphy's Law. When the band does get serious, which isn't very often, it's in the interest of unity and friendship. The title track is basically a fan tribute, thanking a small but loyal group of followers for the support that's enabled Murphy's Law to continue the party. The ska-tinged but heavy \\"1%\\" revels in the outcast-minded punk rock ethos, giving nod to those who embrace the good and bad of surfing the fringe of culture and society. Classic Murphy's Law rage surfaces on \\"Harder Than Who,\\" an attack on the mindless aggression and competition that sometimes rule the hardcore scene. =Good for Now, death of Chuck Valle and two more albums (1993‚Äì2009)= Murphy's Law collected a bunch of stomping, fast and anthem style hardcore punk songs for this. It is first studio album in five years since The Best Of Times. The personnel differed from previous efforts, but Jimmy G's vocals still provide the sound's basis. As with prior albums, the lyrics revolve mainly around smoking, drinking, and partying. A blur of melodic hardcore eventually gives way near the end to some saxophone-led ska. Dedication was released by Another Planet on March 19, 1996. The label had already picked up the rights to their previous material from Profile Records and in 1994 had released a split CD with their self-titled and Back With A Bong albums on the same disc. The album was produced by Daniel Rey who had previously worked with The Ramones, The Misfits, and even Boston hardcore punk band, Gang Green ‚Äì with whom Murphy's Law share a lyrical penchant. He also wrote one of the songs for this album, \\"Green Bud.\\" It follows 1993's Good For Now EP and the 1991 studio album, The Best Of Times. The album Dedicated, released in 1996, was dedicated to former bass player, Chuck Valle, who was killed in a knife related incident in 1994. His picture appears on the back page of the CD inlay and a picture of a tattoo inscribed with the words \\"In Memory of Chuck\\" appears on the jewel case inlay. The band did not record another full-length album until The Party's Over in 2001, but had plenty of singles, compilation, and split EPs with other bands in between. In 2002 Reflex/Wolfpack Records released a European vinyl pressing of The Party's Over. Listeners find former D Generation guitarist Rick Bacchus, bassist Sal Villaneuva (Demonspeed), and drummer Eric Arce (Skarhead) joining forces with original Murphy's Law frontman Jimmy G and producer Daniel Rey (The Ramones, The Misfits, and White Zombie). The result of this 2001 collaboration is 15 tracks of blistering, rowdy, and fast club punk. The song \\"The Party's Over\\" refers to the Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's intense \\"clean up\\" of the Big Apple. There are few musical departures on this predominately speedy punk cd. \\"Walking Alone\\" incorporates a bit of a reggae vibe, while a saxophone line accents \\"Skinhead Girl,\\" a cover of the song originally by Symarip, that takes the tempo down a notch to a swaggering groove (but stays true to punk form). =I Scream Records (2010‚Äìpresent)= On April 12, 2010, Murphy's Law announced in a MySpace blog entry that they were working on a sixth studio album as well as a DVD and vinyl reissues of their back catalog. On May 4, 2011, it was announced that Murphy's Law were signed to I Scream Records, who were scheduled to release the band's first studio album of original material since 2001's The Party's Over, as well as reissues of their back catalog. The reissued albums were released on CD, digital download, and vinyl in 2014 with previously unreleased bonus tracks. However, to date, the new album of original material has yet to be released. Media In 2002, the band appeared in Matthew Barney's film, Cremaster 3 along with Agnostic Front.

Biography = Education = Nestle received her BA from UC Berkeley, Phi Beta Kappa, after attending school there from 1954-1959. Her degrees include a Ph.D in molecular biology and an M.P.H. in public health nutrition, both from the University of California, Berkeley. = Career = She undertook postdoctoral work in biochemistry and developmental biology at Brandeis University, joining the faculty in biology in 1975. Through this professorship, she was assigned a nutrition course to teach and she realized that there was no standardized nutritional requirements, which kicked off her interest in nutrition. From 1976 to 1986, Nestle was associate dean for human biology and taught nutrition at the UCSF School of Medicine. From 1986 to 1988, she was senior nutrition policy advisor in the Department of Health and Human Services and editor of the Surgeon General‚Äôs Report on Nutrition and Health. In 1988, she was appointed Chair of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University. She held the position until 2003. In 1996, she founded the Food Studies program at New York University with food consultant Clark Wolf. She hoped that the new program of study would raise the public‚Äôs awareness of food and its role in culture, society, and personal nutrition. It not only succeeded but inspired other universities to launch their own programs. Her research examines scientific and socioeconomic influences on food choice, obesity, and food safety, emphasizing the role of food marketing. Through her role at NYU and her book, Food Politics (2002), she has become a national influencer of food policy, nutrition, and food education. She is the author of numerous articles in professional publications and is the author or co-author of nine books.

Philosophers of mind have used multiple realizability to argue that mental states are not the same as ‚Äî and cannot be reduced to ‚Äî physical states. They have also used it to defend many versions of functionalism, especially machine-state functionalism. In recent years, however, multiple realizability has been used to attack functionalism, the theory that it was originally used to defend. As a result, functionalism has fallen out of favor in the philosophy of mind.  The notion of multiple realizability  The multiple realizability thesis in the philosophy of mind is the thesis that the same mental state can be realized by different physical states; another way of putting it is that there is a many-to-one mapping from physical states to mental states. Multiple realizability in general is not restricted to the multiple realizability of mental states. Many kinds of things can be realized by numerous physical devices. A wide variety of physical devices can serve as corkscrews, for example. Mental states can also be realized in a variety of ways. Just as the logical states of a Turing machine can be realized by different structural states in different mechanisms, so, by analogy, the mental states of a human being can be realized by different physical states in different individuals. Pain, for example, is correlated with different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, but the organisms all experience the mental state of \\"being in pain.\\" Mental states are multiply realizable not only across species and between individuals but also within individuals. At different times, the same individual may realize the same mental states in physically different forms. Neural plasticity ‚Äî the fact that areas of the brain can assume the functions of other parts that have been damaged as the result of traumatic injury, pathology, natural biological development, or other processes ‚Äî is an example.Block and Fodor (1972) cite the \\"Lashleyan doctrine of neurological equipotentiality\\" in this respect. But so are more mundane facts about neurophsiology, such as the fact that neurons die and connections between them are rewired. Gualtiero Piccinini differentiates three related properties: variable realizability, multiple realizability, and medium independence. * A property is variably realizable if it can be instantiated by different realizers. For example, both a winged corkscrew and a waiter's corkscrew have the property of removing corks and do so through the same mechanism ‚Äî a screw and pull mechanism. Because the mechanism is fundamentally unchanged, the property is variably realizable. * For a property to be multiply realizable, the property must be able to be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms. The classic spring mousetrap and the glue mousetrap instantiate the same property, the ability to trap mice, but they do so through different mechanisms. As such, the property is multiply realizable. * A property is medium independent if it can be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms and if the inputs and outputs of the mechanisms are also multiply realizable. A mousetrap is not medium independent; it must take a mouse as an input. A computer, though, is medium independent. A computer can be constructed from different parts assembled into different mechanisms and can take different types of inputs and outputs. In typical digital computers, the inputs and outputs are voltages, but in quantum computers, the inputs and outputs would be different.  The significance of multiple realizability  Multiple realizability has been used as an argument against type-identity theory, against reductionist theories of mind in general, for functionalist theories of mind, and even against functionalist theories of mind. Starting in the 1960s, Hilary Putnam used multiple realizability as an argument against type-identity theory. Specifically, Putnam noted that the multiple realizability of pain entails that, contrary to type-identity theory, pain is not identical to C-fibre firing. More generally, multiple realizability shows that psychological attributes are not the same as physical attributes. Psychological attributes, rather, are disjunctions of physical attributes. Fodor, Putnam, and others noted that, along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena would be insufficiently abstract and general. Jerry Fodor (1975) deployed multiple realizability more generally as an argument against any reductionist account of the relation between higher-level sciences and physics. Fodor also uses multiple realizability to argue against reductionism not only of psychology but of any special sciences (that is, any sciences that are \\"higher level\\" than physics). In his characterization of reductionism, all mental kind predicates in an ideal and completed psychology must correspond with physical kind predicates in an ideal and completed physics. He suggests taking Ernest Nagel's theory of reduction, which insists on the derivability of all terms in the theory to be reduced from terms in the reducing theory and the bridging laws, as the canonical theory of reduction. Given generalized multiple realizability, the physical science part of these psychophysical bridge laws will end up being a (possibly infinite) disjunction of all the terms referring to possible physical realizations of a mental kind. This disjunction cannot be a kind-predicate and therefore the entire statement cannot be a law of physics. The special sciences therefore cannot be reduced to physics. Functionalism, which attempts to identify mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from particle physics and hence seems to be a more suitable explanation of the relation between mind and body. As a result of these arguments and others that build upon them, the dominant theory in philosophy of mind since the 1960s has been a version of non-reductive physicalism based on multiple realizability.Lepore and Pylyshyn called non-reductive physicalism the \\"received view.\\" Jaegwon Kim calls non-reductive physicalism the \\"new orthodoxy\\" on the mind-body problem. Bechtel and Mundale write that, \\"The claim, originating with Hilary Putnam, that psychological states are multiply realizable, has become orthodoxy in the philosophy of mind.\\" In 1988, Hilary Putnam used multiple realizability to argue against functionalism. Noting that functionalism is essentially a watered-down reductionist or identity theory in which mental kinds are ultimately identified with functional kinds, Putnam argues that mental kinds are probably multiply realizable over functional kinds. The same mental state or property can be implemented or realized by different states of a universal Turing machine.  Arguments for multiple realizability  = The conceivability argument = Putnam asks whether alien beings, artificially intelligent robots, and silicon-based life forms should be considered a priori incapable of experiencing pain merely because they do not have the same neurochemistry as humans. We can imagine that they might share our psychological states despite being made of different stuff. Our ability to conceive of that possibility means that multiple realizability is possible. = The likelihood argument = Putnam cites examples from the animal kingdom as evidence for the multiple realizability of mental states. Evolutionary biology ‚Äî including evolutionary neuroscience ‚Äî and comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have demonstrated that mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mollusks have different brain structures. These animals can only share the same mental states and properties if these mental states and properties can be realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam concludes that type-identity and other reductive theories make an extremely \\"ambitious\\" and \\"highly implausible\\" conjecture that can be disproven with just one example of multiple realizability. On the contrary, it is likely that creatures that cannot be in identical physical states, due to their different composition and structure, can nevertheless be in identical psychological states.This way of putting it owes to Some philosophers refer to this argument ‚Äî that multiple realizability is much more likely than reductionism ‚Äî as the likelihood argument. = The a priori argument = Putnam also formulates a complementary argument based on functional isomorphism. He defines the concept in these terms: \\"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations.\\" Two computers, for example, are functionally isomorphic if the sequential relations among states in one are exactly mirrored by those in the other. A computer made of electrical components and a computer made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic even though they are constitutionally different. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. Some philosophers refer to this as the a priori argument.  Arguments against multiple realizability  Some philosophers deny that mental states are multiply realizable. A detailed examination of how brain areas are identified in neuroscience shows that psychological functions are not, in fact, multiply realizable. Arguments against the significance of multiple realizability Some philosophers accept the thesis that mental states are multiply realizable but deny that multiple realizability gives rise to functionalism or other forms of non-reductive physicalism. = Reductionism in other sciences = Early objections to multiple realizability were limited to the narrow, \\"across structures-type\\" version. Starting with David Kellogg Lewis, many reductionists argued that it is very common in scientific practice to reduce one theory to another via local, structure-specific reductions. A frequently cited example of this sort of intertheoretic reduction is temperature. The temperature of a gas is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy. Temperature in a solid is identical to mean maximal molecular kinetic energy because the molecules of a solid are more restricted in their movements. Temperature in a plasma is a mystery because the molecules of a plasma are torn apart. Therefore, temperature is multiply realized in a diversity of microphysical states. = Disjunction = Jaegwon Kim argues that disjunction ‚Äî the idea that the physical realization of a particular mental state is not a particular physical state but the disjunction of the physical states that realize that mental state ‚Äî creates problems for multiple realizability. Putnam also argued against this \\"disjunctive\\" possibility in later work. Block and Fodor had also argued against it. = Causal closure of the physical = Kim has also argued against non-reductive physicalism on the grounds that it violates the causal closure of the physical, which assumes that physics provides a full explanation of physical events. If mental properties are causally efficacious, they must either be identical to physical properties or there must be widespread overdetermination. The latter is often held to be either unlikely or even impossible on conceptual grounds. If Kim is right, then the options seem to be either reduction or elimination. = Insufficient generalizability = One criticism of multiple realizability is that any theory that attempts to address the possibility of generalized multiple realizability must necessarily be so local and context-specific in nature (referring exclusively to a certain token system of a certain structure-type at a certain time) that its reductions would be incompatible with even a minimally acceptable degree of generality in scientific theorizing. Any psychology that is sufficiently narrow to accommodate this level of multiple realizability required to account for neural plasticity will almost certainly not be general enough to capture the generalizations needed to explain human psychology. Some reductionists reply that this is not empirically plausible. Research and experimentation in the neurosciences requires that some universal consistencies in brain structures must either exist or be assumed to exist. The similarity (produced by homology or convergent evolution) of brain structures allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability (especially the generalized form) were an empirical fact, then results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful or useful when generalized to explain the behavior or characteristics of another species (or organism of the same species; or in the generalized form, even the same organism). Sungsu Kim has recently responded to this objection using the distinction between homology of brain structures and homoplasy. Homologies are characteristics of physiology, morphology, behavior, or psychology shared by two or more species and inherited from a common ancestor. Homoplasies are similar or identical characteristics shared by two or more species but not inherited from a common ancestor, having evolved independently. The feet of ducks and platypuses are an example of homoplasy, while the hands of humans and chimps are an example of homology. The fact that brain structures are homologous provides no evidence either for or against multiple realizability. The only way to empirically test the thesis of multiple realizability would be to examine brain structures and determine whether some homoplasious \\"psychological processes or functions might be 'constructed' from different material\\" and supported by different brain structures just as the flight capacities of bats and birds emerge from different morphophysiologies. The emergence of similar behavioral outputs or psychological functions brought about by similar or identical brain structures in convergent evolutionary lineages would provide some evidence against multiple realizability, since it is highly improbable that this would happen, if not for constraints on the type of physical system that can realize mental phenomena. This, however, would not completely refute the possibility of realizability of mental states in radically different physical systems such as non-carbon based life forms or machines. *  Historical note  Observations of multiple realizability ‚Äî and of its relation to functionalism ‚Äî predate their use in philosophy beginning in the 1960s. Alan Turing remarked on multiple realizability in 1950, for example,Restrepo, R. (2009). Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science. Minds and Machines 19(2): 181-197. writing: \\"The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical will help us rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and the nervous system is also electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. ...

In the 1950s when developers were working to expand the original solitary ski run, they negotiated with the then PA DER for permission to use a small portion of the state park for the ski area in exchange for $1 a year and the obligation to maintain the entire park. Camelback Ski Area in the Winter. Camelback Mountain (Big Pocono) itself reaches an elevation of 2,133 feet (650 m). There are 166 acres (67 hectares) of skiing & snowboarding terrain; the mountains have a total of 35 slopes (the longest of which is 1 mile(1,609 m), namely, the Nile Mile) and features a vertical drop of 800 ft (244 m), 15 lifts, including 2 high speed detachable chairlifts; the Sullivan Express and Stevenson Express, both quads. It is the largest ski resort in the Poconos. It has two terrain parks. The resort was opened in December 1963. The mountain summit receives an average of 50 in (127 cm) of snowfall each winter. It has snowmaking facilities on ski slopes, primarily relying on portable snow guns to create snow, and is 100% lit for night skiing. In May 2015 Camelback opened Camelback Resort and Indoor Waterpark. An additional attraction was added with Camelback Mountain Adventures. Camelback Mountain Resort is from Pinemere Camp, and about north of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Camelback invested in their educational ski and snowboard programs. They use the marketing term, Learn Here, Learn Right. Camelback Resort and Indoor Waterpark Camelback Resort and Indoor Waterpark was opened in 2015. Their waterpark, known as Aquatopia, was voted the #1 Indoor Waterpark in the country by USA Today for 2015. The indoor park is open year-round while the outdoor park is open only in the summer. Aquatopia includes over 37 waterslides (the most in Pennsylvania), including four body slides, a mat slide, five tube slides and four raft rides, in addition to a wave pool, lazy river, a children's play area, and a full- sized competition pool. Aquatopia also features the FlowRider, a wave riding pool for surfing and boogie boarding. Aerial View of Camelback Mountain Resort.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1991 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History Watervale, c.1950 Leo F. Hale began a logging and shipping operation in this area in the early 1890s. In 1893, Hale, along with William and Mary Vincent, platted out the village of Watervale on the south shore of Lower Herring Lake. They built about 20 houses, many of which were shacks. There were, however, at least eight painted frame houses. The village also contained a meat market, general store, and post office. As the logging boom waned, Hale went bankrupt, and by 1900 had lost most of Watervale; it was eventually nearly abandoned. In 1917, Dr. Oscar H. Kraft of Chicago purchased the town and adjacent land to use as a resort for his family. He restored several buildings, and opened it that summer as a public resort. Kraft's niece, Vera Noble, and her husband Vernon purchased the resort in 1960; Vera ran Watervale until her death in 2005, when it was passed on to her children. Description The Watervale Historic District contains 16 buildings constructed between 1892 and 1927 sited along Watervale Road.

He was nicknamed the Opium King in Hong Kong and Macau.  Early life  Lee was born in Hawaii. Lee's father was Lee Leung-yik (), a businessman who was heavily involved in the opium business in Hong Kong and China. Lee's ancestral home was Xinhui, Guangdong Province, China. As a young boy, he lived in San Francisco when his father moved there. At age seventeen, he returned to Hong Kong and continued his studies at Queen's College. Since he spoke English fluently, he later taught English at Queen's College, his alma mater.  Career  Lee's father achieved great wealth from the opium trade, and Lee inherited his father's business. Having amassed a great fortune from his successful opium business, Lee later participated in the fast-growing Hong Kong real estate market. In 1923, he bought the Jardine's Hill property, west of Causeway Bay, from Jardines for HK$3.8 million. He initially wanted to build opium refinery facilities there, but owing to the global anti-opium movement, he changed his plan and developed the property as Lee Garden. It is approximately the area around Lee Garden Road, Lee Theatre, Yun Ping Road and Percival Street.  Children  In March 1905, Lee's son Richard Charles Lee was born in Hong Kong. In December 1924, Lee's son Jung Kong Lee was also born in Hong Kong.  Death and legacy  On 30 April 1928, Lee was shot on a street in the Central district in Hong Kong and died shortly after yelling for help. The assassination was possibly due to a growing public resentment of his opium business, which people believed had caused great harm to Chinese society. The assassin was never caught, despite his family offering a huge bounty. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at HK$4.4 million. The present-day Hysan Development Company has a market capitalization in excess of HK$20 billion. =Landmarks named after him= * Lee Garden ** Lee Garden One ** Lee Garden Two ** Lee Garden Three ** Lee Garden Five ** Lee Garden Six Hysan Place * Lee Hysan Hall in the University of Hong Kong * Lee Hysan Medical Library in the University of Hong Kong, renamed as Yu Chun Keung Medical Library after moving Doggerel There was a popular doggerel in Hong Kong showing Lee's notoriety.

The API is divided into a number of \\"kits\\", which collect related classes together and bear some relation to the library which contains the supporting code. It is almost entirely C++, with third-party bindings for most classes in Python and a tiny subset of classes, mostly Storage kit related, in Perl. Kits ; The Application kit contains the basic classes required to launch a BeOS application, as well as support for the global clipboard, inter-application and internal messaging, timers, rosters and other functions seen as required to support any graphical application. Application kit classes are supported by libbe.so ; The Storage kit provides methods for manipulating files from creating and managing symlinks all the way to the file open/save panels for graphical applications, as well as dealing with Be File System attributes. Storage kit classes are mostly in libtracker.so, Tracker being the native file manager on the OS. ; The Interface kit provides a large collection of widgets for building graphical applications from the main window class down to dialogue boxes, including font handling and rendering control. The majority of libbe.so comprises this kit. ; The Kernel kit provides threading, semaphores and the ability to access system information, and is also in libbe.so ;Support Kit The Support kit provides more advanced functions which do not readily fall into another kit, such as assisted memory allocation and list support. ; The Network kit provides either a rudimentary (BeOS R5 and lower) or almost complete (BeOS Dano and higher) implementation of Berkeley sockets and BIND as well as \\"native\\" functions based on the Nettle C++ networking library. libnet.so provides the Berkeley sockets on R5, later replaced by the more common libsocket/libbind.so nomenclature; and libnetapi on R5, later replaced by libbnetapi provides the modified version of Nettle. ; The Mail kit provides a native email format as well as a way to use the system to fetch and receive email using standard protocols (POP3 and SMTP). The Mail kit is supported in libmail.so ; The Translation kit provides a method whereby both images and plain text formats are handled by addons allowing applications to support only one format, a native intermediate one, and save/load to any addon-supported format. The API also allows video and audio translation through the library, although this was superseded by BeOS R4 and immediately disabled. The Translation kit is supported in libtranslation.so ; The Media kit provides an audio and video input/output abstraction layer based on pluggable addons, as well as handling sound mixing, audio and video format translation and other media related functions. Media kit functions are supported by libmedia.so ; The MIDI kit provides MIDI hardware input and output abstraction as well as a software synthesiser (provided by Headspace in BeOS R5). libmidi.so provides the old, BeOS R3 era MIDI API, libmidi2.so provides the R4+ API. ; The Game kit provides a number of sound formats suited to computer game audio output, as well as the ability to run full-screen applications and use video overlays. ; The OpenGL kit provides an implementation of OpenGL as well as supporting classes to allow its use in native applications. In BeOS R5, the supported OpenGL version was 1.1, and was software accelerated, although the kit was hardware-neutral, and in fact outperformed many hardware implementations that were running on competing platforms which could not deliver similar latency/bandwidth performance due to underlying inefficiencies in their design or implementation.ATI Radeon/Voodoo2 OpenGL Benchmarks, BeOS vs. Windows98 again! Who's faster?, By Eugenia Loli, 2001 October 16, BeNews ; The Device kit provides platform-abstracted direct hardware access to serial and parallel ports, as well as the BeBoxs infamous GeekPort. ;Locale Kit The Locale Kit provides classes to localize applications to different languages, time zones, number formatting conventions etc. The kit is only found in the Haiku implementation of the BeOS API. ;Services Kit The Services Kit provides a lightweight direct connection to web services.

The kit is only found in the Haiku implementation of the BeOS API. ;Package Kit The Package Kit provides the means of package management. The kit is only found in the Haiku implementation of the BeOS API. Non-BeOS implementations The majority of the Be API has been reimplemented by Haiku for their open-source BeOS replacement, although in an effort to catch up with the intervening years since BeOS R5 some additional functionality has been added, ranging from large changes to the Mail kit to support IMAP, encrypted connections and multiple accounts, and a move to OpenGL 1.5 support via Mesa 3D. Alternative systems have attempted to draw some inspiration (Syllable) from the BeOS API, but are not making attempts to provide a base to port applications. A private port of much of the API to Microsoft Windows and later Linux (using GTK+) was done by Gobe Software to enable them to port their Gobe Productive office suite to these platforms from BeOS, where it had originally been developed. Documentation The entire API, as it was at the stage of BeOS Revision 3, was documented in two paper books - the Be Developer Guide and Be Advanced Topics, released by O'Reilly Media under a Be, Inc imprint in 1997/8. In addition, a digital representation of this was provided and updated with BeOS itself.

He was inducted into the United States Track & Field Hall of Fame in 2012. Currently, Charles and Javier Sotomayor are the only two high jumpers that have won gold medals in the Olympics, Outdoor World Championships, Indoor World Championships and World Cup Championships. Hennadiy Avdyeyenko, who won the inaugural 1983 Outdoor World Championship setting the championship high jump record with a jump of 2.32m (7' 7 1/4\\"), and Charles are the only two high jumpers to win and establish the championship record in both the Outdoor World Championship and Olympics Games. Also, Charles has the highest combined average height for the two championships. Career Charles Austin coached himself over his 15-year professional career to where only seven people in the history of the high jump jumped higher. Standing 6' 1/2\\", he jumped 22 inches over his height, sixth all time. An Olympic gold medalist, Austin is the current American and Olympic high jump record holder, two-time World Champion, and a nine-time national track and field high jump champion. From starting in high school to the end of his career, Charles improved almost a foot in height. Born in Bay City, Texas, and raised in Van Vleck, Texas, Austin was the youngest of 10 children. He was a senior in high school without any way to pay for college, when some friends convinced him to try high jumping for the track team. He cleared six feet on his first try to make the team and finished the year with a personal best of 6' 11\\". Austin's success landed him an athletic scholarship at Southwest Texas University (now Texas State University). After a difficult first few years, he climbed the ranks in the NCAA, shattering school records and his senior year, won the NCAA Outdoor Championship in 1990 and was the number one college high jumper in the country. In 1991, Austin graduated with a degree in business administration. Within the year, five years after taking up the high jump in 1986, he was the American Record Holder (2.40m ‚Äì 7'10 1/2\\"), gold medalist at the 1991 World Championship and was a contender to win in the Olympics. However, when he arrived at the 1992 Olympic trials there was speculation on whether or not he should compete, due to a knee injury. He pushed forward, making it on to the U.S. team, but his confidence was shaken and a poor performance cost him a medal. He finished in eighth place. The trouble continued, forcing Austin to have major surgery in July 1993 where almost half of his patellar tendon had to be removed due to the damage that was caused. Because of the severity of the injury Austin was told his high jump career was over. He took it upon himself to rehabilitate his knee back to where he could once again compete at the highest level. He was left to watch from home as his fellow athletes competed in the 1993 World Championship. But while his knee healed, Austin's passion continued to grow. In 1994, he began his journey back to the top of the world high jump ranks. Within a few years, he had regained his strength and was once again performing at a high level. When he returned to the Olympics in 1996, he did so with a new determination and mental focus. His gold winning jump of 7' 10\\" was a new Olympic record and still stands today. He was inducted into the United States Hall of Fame in 2012 After Athletics Austin is the owner of So High Sports and Fitness (SoHighSports.com) a sports performance and personal training company. He opened his So High Sports and Fitness Studio in 2002 and his So High Sports and Fitness Performance Center in 2008. Both are located in San Marcos, Texas. Charles is also the author of the book, Head Games: Life's Greatest Challenge. In 2014, Charles introduced his patented Total Body Board (TotalBodyBoard.com) to the fitness equipment market. The Total Body Board is a versatile piece of fitness equipment. Also, Charles set the Master's 45‚Äì50 age group World Record with a jump of 6' 8 3/4\\" (2.05m).

The area had been a rural sanitary district prior to the Local Government Act 1894. Penrith itself was covered by Penrith Urban District, which the Rural District surrounded on the west, north and east. The council was based at offices known as Mansion House in Penrith now used by its successor authority Eden District Council. Within the district's boundaries was a small part of the Lake District National Park. The district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, being merged with other districts to form the Eden district.

The formal head of the Isle of Man Government is the Lieutenant Governor, the personal representative of Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann. The executive head is the Chief Minister. Douglas, the largest town in the Isle of Man, is its capital and seat of government, where most Government offices and the parliament chambers (Tynwald) are located.

After the Revestment in 1765 the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the British Government, and not democratically responsible to the Manx people. Conflict between the House of Keys (popularly elected after 1866) and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head during the tenure of Lord Raglan (1902‚Äì18). =Council of Ministers= After World War I the Lieutenant Governor gradually ceded control to Tynwald, a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911,Report of the Departmental Committee on the Constitution etc. of the Isle of Man, 1911, Cd.5950 (the 'MacDonnell Report') 1959Report of the Commission on the Isle of Man Constitution, 1959 (the MacDermott Report') and 1969.Report of the Joint Working Party on the Constitutional Relationship between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom, 1969 (the 'Stonham Report') An Executive Council, chaired by him and including members of Tynwald, was established in 1949, and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island. Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976.Finance Act 1958, Finance Act 1962, Police (Isle of Man) Act 1962, Governor's Financial and Judicial Functions (Transfer) Act 1976: Statutes of the Isle of Man The Lieutenant Governor ceased to chair the Executive Council in 1980, being replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald,Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1980 and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards;Constitution (Executive Council) Act 1984 in 1986 they were given the title 'Minister' and the chairman was styled 'Chief Minister'.Constitution (Executive Council) (Amendment) Act 1986 In 1990 the Council was renamed the 'Council of Ministers'.Council of Ministers Act 1990 =Departments= During the 19th century several bodies, which came to be known as 'Boards of Tynwald', were created to exercise functions under democratic control. These included the Board of Education (1872), Highway Board (1874), Asylums Board (1888), Government Property Trustees (1891) and Local Government Board (1894). However, although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald, the Boards' freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor's control of the Island's budget and his power to appoint certain of their members. The structure of the Boards of Tynwald, along with other bodies variously called 'Statutory Boards' and 'Commercial Boards', became increasingly unwieldy after the 1950s, and was eventually reformed in the 1980s, when a system of 'ministerial government' was set up.

Despite its name, Hackensack Township did not encompass the present-day city of Hackensack, which was within New Barbadoes Township on the west side of the Hackensack River.Clayton, 1882. p. 163. \\"Under this act a court of small causes was organized at 'New Hackensack,' probably the village now known as Hackensack, with the 'New' prefixed to it for a time to distinguish it from Old Hackensack (township) on the east side the river.\\" As originally constituted on October 31, 1693, the township included portions of present-day Bergen County between the Hudson River on the east and the Hackensack River to the west, northward to the boundary with New York and south to the border with current Hudson County.Snyder, John P. The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 79. Accessed October 22, 2015. In 1775, Harrington Township was formed by royal charter from the northern portions of both New Barbadoes Township and Hackensack Township. On March 22, 1871, Hackensack Township was subdivided into three new townships, each stretching from the Hudson River on the east to the Hackensack River in the west. The northern portion became Palisades Township, the center strip became Englewood Township, and the southern portion became Ridgefield Township. With the creation of these three new townships, Hackensack Township was dissolved that same day, March 22, 1871.

He is the current manager of the Syracuse Mets in the International League. Playing career Kreuter played for seven different ballclubs during his career: the Texas Rangers (1988‚Äì91, 2003), Detroit Tigers (1992‚Äì94), Seattle Mariners (1995), Chicago White Sox (1996‚Äì97, 1998), Anaheim Angels (1997‚Äì98), Kansas City Royals (1999) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2000‚Äì02). He made his major league debut on September 14, 1988 as the starting catcher wearing #7, and played his final game on April 27, 2003 as the starting catcher wearing #12. Kreuter's best season was 1993 with the Tigers, when he batted .286 with 15 home runs and slugged .484, while appearing in a career high 119 games. Kreuter's career included the unusual occurrence that he was traded from the White Sox to the Angels twice. The White Sox sent him along with Tony Phillips to the Angels on May 18, 1997, and after he signed back with the Sox as a free-agent in the off-season, they again sent him to Anaheim on September 18, 1998. On May 16, 2000, Kreuter was involved in a brawl with fans at Wrigley Field in Chicago as he sat in the Dodgers bullpen along the right field foul line. During the 9th of inning of the game, a Cubs fan smacked the back of Kreuter's head and took his cap, prompting Kreuter and several other Dodgers to enter the stands and fight with fans. Kreuter and several other Dodgers were suspended eight games apiece, and a total of 19 players received fines. The Dodgers later settled a lawsuit with a fan who alleged that Kreuter choked him. Coaching career Kreuter was named the coach of the USC Trojans on June 2, 2006, after former coach Mike Gillespie (who is also his father-in- law) retired. He was relieved as head coach on August 9, 2010, posting a 111‚Äì117 record in four years.http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-basebl/spec- rel/080910aaa.html Kreuter was named as the manager for the St. Lucie Mets of the New York Mets organization for the 2018 season.

Dorsten is situated on the western rim of Westphalia bordering the Rhineland. Its historical old town lies on the south bank of the river Lippe and the Wesel‚ÄìDatteln Canal and was granted city rights in 1251. During the twentieth century, the town was enlarged in its north by the villages of the former Herrlichkeit Lembeck. While Dorsten's northern districts are thus shaped by the rural M√ºnsterland with its many historical castles, just south of the town the Ruhr region begins, Germany's largest urban agglomeration with more than seven million inhabitants. The exact linguistic derivation of the word \\"Dorsten\\" is unknown, leaving the meaning of the town's name unclear. History Archaeological findings show that the area was already populated during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, from about 4000 BC onwards. The Romans established a military camp in Dorsten-Holsterhausen in 11 BC and Varus passed through it in 9BC on his way to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. From around 700 AD onwards, the Archbishopric of Cologne began to evangelise the area around Dorsten. Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden, together with the Count of Cleves, granted Dorsten the city rights in 1251. Due to its economically favourable position on the river Lippe, the town became a member of the Hanseatic League of international trading cities and turned into the richest town in the Vest Recklinghausen. In 1488, Franciscan friars established a friary which continues to exist today as the world‚Äôs oldest permanently existing cloister of this order. The monks founded Gymnasium Petrinum in 1642 and in 1699 the Ursulines set up a cloister including a boarding school for girls. However, the Thirty Years‚Äô War (1618‚Äì48), the Hessian War and the continuous occupation by various forces badly derogated Dorsten‚Äôs medieval wealth. On 9 February 1633, Hesse-Cassel captured the town of Dorsten without resistance from the Electorate of Cologne and the Vest of Recklinghausen and, in the years that followed, it was turned into the strongest fortress in the region. As a result, attempts were made to recapture it. The first siege in 1636 was unsuccessful, but in 1641, a second Siege of Dorsten resulted in considerable destruction of the town and the eventual surrender of the garrison. It was only during the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century that Dorsten returned to its former prosperity. Spinning, weaving and metal casting industries found their way into town and in 1912, the first coal mine opened. Between 1929 and 1975, surrounding villages became districts of the gradually enlarging town of Dorsten. Only a few days before the end of the Second World War, the historical old town was almost completely destroyed in an Allied air raid. However, after 1945, the town‚Äôs centre was rebuilt on its historical foundations and thus still resembles its medieval shape today. Dorsten is widely known today for its Jewish Museum of Westphalia which was established in 1987. In 2001, the last coal mine closed and the town celebrated its 750th jubilee with a festival in the old town.

The breed is included in the origins of the Dobermann, the Rottweiler, Miniature Pinscher, the Standard Schnauzer (and, by extension, the Miniature Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer). The breed is rising in numbers in the U.S., mainly due to their full acceptance to AKC in 2003. In Australia, the breed is established with a rise in popularity becoming evident. Description Westminster Kennel Club's first German Pinscher Best of Opposite Sex winner, 2003 Westminster Kennel Club's first German Pinscher Best of Breed winner, 2003 The German Pinscher is a medium-sized dog, usually weighing between 25‚Äì45 pounds (11‚Äì20 kilograms) and typically 17‚Äì20 inches (43‚Äì51 centimetres) in height, with a short coat. Colors for this breed include black and rust, red, fawn, blue and tan. The ideal German Pinscher is elegant in appearance with a strong square build and moderate body structure, muscular and powerful endurance and agility. For all countries where the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale standard applies, only black and rust and solid red are allowed colors. Colors that became extinct during the world wars of the twentieth century include solid black, salt-and-pepper, and harlequin. German Pinschers previously had their tails docked and ears cropped in countries where the procedures are legal. Historically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when working. Ears also were cropped, as they were thought to prevent injuries while working and increase the intense appearance of the canine. Today, these are done mainly for cosmetic reasons, although most countries are moving away from the procedure that has been found to be unnecessary for most dogs in their new life as pets and activity partners.  History  Drawing of a German Pinscher and a Miniature Pinscher (Pinscher und Zwergpinscher), 1888. Typical red German Pinscher female The Wire Haired and Smooth Haired Pinschers, as the Standard Schnauzer and German Pinscher were originally called, were shown in dog books as early as 1884. However drawings of the German Pinscher date back to at least 1780, and the breed is proposed by one author to possibly trace its roots to a dog called the Ratter that guarded farms in Germany as far back as the 15th century.Sharon Morgan & Dee Gannon, \\"The German Pinscher (Comprehensive Owners Guide)\\" Kennel Club Books - Special edition, (November 29, 2006), p. 9. These medium-sized dogs descended from early European herding and guardian breeds. The source of the German Pinscher can be traced back to 1836 when this breed surpassed the Mops in popularity. Pinschers were used as guardians for coaches. They also lived in homesteads where they were used to kill vermin, a job they did by instinct, as such behavior did not need to be trained into the breed. Even today you can observe German Pinschers searching for and finding rats in open areas and in homes. The Standard Schnauzer (then referred to as the Wire Haired Pinscher) was originally born in the same litter as the German Pinscher. Over time, breeders decided to separate the \\"varieties,\\" changing them to actual \\"breeds\\". After three generations of the same coat were born, the Pinscher-Schnauzer club allowed them to be registered as their respective \\"breed\\". From 1950 to 1958, no litter had been registered. Credit is attributed to Werner Jung for collecting several of the breed in 1958 to continue the German Pinscher as we know the breed today. The German Pinscher came to breeders in the United States in the early 1980s, though accounts of singular German Pinschers appearing in the country before then have been noted. In 1985, the German Pinscher Club of America was started by various German Pinscher fanciers, most of whom are no longer active in the breed. At this time, the German Pinscher was shown in rare breed shows. They were also recognized by the United Kennel Club. The German Pinscher gained full acceptance by the Canadian Kennel Club in 2000. In 2004, the German Pinscher competed at its first Westminster Kennel Club. The Best of Breed winner was Ch. Windamir Hunter des Charmettes with the Best of Opposite Sex to Best of Breed won by Ch. Windamir's Chosen One. = Extinct varieties = There are several now-extinct varieties of the German Pinscher: * Schweizer Pinscher (also called the Jonataler Pinscher, Pfisterlinge, Silberpinsch, Swiss Salt and Pepper Pinscher, Swiss Shorthair Pinscher) * Seidenpinscher (also called the German Silky Pinscher, Silky Pinscher) Some of these may have recently been re-formed from the German Pinscher and marketed as rare breeds for those seeking unique pets.  Health and temperament  = Temperament = German Pinscher on the lookout German Pinscher watching a video on a laptop German Pinscher resting on a chair A German Pinscher should be an alert, good natured and playful dog. They are known for being very loyal, watchful and fearless. A well-bred German Pinscher will be a loving companion with an even temperament. When considering adding a German Pinscher to a family, it is advised to be able to meet and touch the mother of the puppy you are offered. German Pinschers are very energetic working dogs, in many cases requiring several hours of exercise a day. Accordingly, a large, securely fenced yard is highly recommended for anyone considering the breed as a pet and the owner to be mindful of training them appropriately. Socialization from puppyhood is a must, as high prey drive is common in the breed so in a city environment they need to learn to control their impulses. This does, however, make them a great fetch companion. = Health = Due to the small gene pool of the German Pinscher, breeders should health test their dogs for hereditary cataracts, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, von Willebrand disease, thyroid disorder, and with the increased incidences of cardiac disease due to irresponsible breeding practices, German Pinschers suspect for heart issues should be removed from all breeding programs.

The product focuses mainly on sales, marketing, and service (help desk) sectors, but Microsoft has been marketing Dynamics CRM as a CRM platform and has been encouraging partners to use its once proprietary, now Open Source (.NET based) framework to customize it. It is part of the Microsoft Dynamics family of business applications. Dynamics CRM is a server- client application, which, like Microsoft SharePoint, is primarily an IIS- based web application which also supports extensive web services interfaces. Clients access Dynamics CRM either by using a browser or by a thick client plug-in to Microsoft Outlook. Besides Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox browsers are fully supported since Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Update Rollup 12. The current version is Dynamics 365.

If more CALs are needed, an upgrade to Professional or Enterprise should be done. Also all the server roles are installed on 1 machine and cannot be separated. You can only create 1 organization in this version and the use of external connectors is not allowed. This version is ideal for small organizations that can use it with the SQL Server Work group Edition and on a Windows Small Business Server. *Professional Edition The Professional Edition has the same functionality as the Work group Edition except there is no limit on the CALs. If the installation profile calls for supporting either multiple organizations or servers, the Enterprise Edition is required. *Enterprise Edition Has the same functionality as the Professional Edition but without limits. This version is to be used when multiple divisions should be accessing CRM from one platform. *Service Provider Edition This edition is actually an Enterprise Edition that is configured to accept Internal user requests from AD and external user requests through IFD (Internet Facing Deployment). This version is mostly implemented by Microsoft Partners that offer Hosted CRM functionality, when letting external users connect to this CRM version through the Internet. = Licensing = Microsoft Dynamics CRM offers two types of licenses: Server license and Client Access License (CAL). Each deployment should have at least one server license and one CAL. CAL is also known as a user license. There are two types of Client CAL: *Named User CAL: This is tied with the user name i.e. the user can access MSCRM from any computer. *Device CAL: This is tied with the Device (i.e., CRM can be accessed from only one device). This model is useful in environments such as Call Centers. Read Only Licenses New in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 are readonly licenses. Users that do not have to have write permissions can be assigned Read Only licenses. These licenses are cheaper because they do not allow any write operations on the records. If later a user should be able to perform a write operation, a step-up license can be bought to upgrade the Read-Only license to a Full Client Access License. Full Use Licenses Full Use Licenses are licenses where the client (user / device) has read, write and update permissions. External Connector Licenses Whenever an application (windows or web) reads or writes data from/in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, an external connector license is required. External Connector licenses are only valid when bought for a Professional or Enterprise edition. It is not allowed to use them with a Workgroup Edition. These also come in three forms: *External Connector: Is a combination of the Limited External Connector (that provides Read Only functionality) and the Full Use Additive External Connector (that provides Write Only functionality) *Limited External Connector: Provides Read Only functionality for the external application. This license can be upgraded to an 'External Connector License' when the Full Use Additive External Connector is bought. *Full Use Additive External Connector: Provides the Write functionality to a \\"Limited External Connector\\" license. Dynamics CRM version 4.0 adds a number of new features, including support for duplicate data detection and other enhancements. Perhaps most importantly, CRM 4.0 provides true multi-tenancy, which will allow the creation of multiple organizations on a single server.

It generally runs from west to east through five counties, beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg, crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, and ending in Carmel. NY 52 and NY 55, both major east-west routes of the Mid- Hudson Region, run parallel to each other, intersecting in downtown Liberty. With the exception of the section overlapping Interstate 84 (I-84), most of Route 52 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas. The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley, such as the villages of Jeffersonville, Ellenville and Walden. East of the Hudson, it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill. It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon, following a ferry between them, but since the bridge's construction Route 52 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north. Much of what is today Route 52 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century. After their operating companies folded later in the century, the state took over the roads in the 1890s. While some portions of today's Route 52 were included in New York's first designations of state highways, it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route 52 took that number. At that time it followed most of its present alignment, but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22. The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s, along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216. When the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge was opened in the early 1960s, Route 52 was rerouted onto I-84, bypassing a route to the ferry landings in Newburgh and Beacon. The alignment to I-84 in the latter city is today Route 52 Business. Route description = Sullivan County = A little over half of NY 52's total mileage is in Sullivan County, due to its circuitous route in the less developed western half of the county, where some segments are maintained by the county rather than the state. East of Liberty, the route takes a more direct course toward its highest elevation, in the part of the county that is more dominated by resorts and summer camps.  Narrowsburg to Jeffersonville  NY 52 begins at the midpoint of the Narrowsburg‚ÄìDarbytown Bridge over the Delaware River as a county-maintained continuation of PA 652 (Beach Lake Highway). Co-designated as County Route 24 (CR 24), NY 52 proceeds southeast through the hamlet of Narrowsburg in the town of Tusten as the two- lane Bridge Street. After crossing over Norfolk Southern's Southern Tier Line, NY 52 and CR 24 pass St. Francis Xavier Cemetery and then leave the center of Narrowsburg, merging with NY 97 south of Feagles Lake. County maintenance ends at this point. The Narrowsburg-Darbytown Bridge, the western terminus of NY 52 The two routes soon bend eastward to a junction where NY 52 turns northward on a county-maintained roadway. Now co-designated as CR 111, NY 52 bends northeast through Tusten, remaining a two-lane rural roadway as it climbs slightly out of the river valley. The surrounding landscape is mostly forested, with occasional farm clearings. A mile from that junction, NY 52 and CR 111 reach the small hamlet of Lava, crossing the northern terminus of CR 25 (Eckes Road). Continuing northeast out of Lava, the two routes continue past Beaver Pond and then descend into the Tenmile River valley. A short distance later, NY 52 crosses into the town of Cochecton, where CR 111 terminates and NY 52 becomes concurrent with CR 112. NY 52 continues northeast through Cochecton, reaching the hamlet of Cochecton Center. After passing through, NY 52 and CR 112 turn straight northwest for through Cochecton at a junction with CR 115 (Browntown Road). At the second junction with Kelly Road, the route turns north for a half-mile (800 m), turning westward at Buff Road to reach the southern shore of Lake Huntington. The routes turn north along the western shore, entering the eponymous hamlet and reaching the eastern terminus of CR 116\\\\. At this junction, CR 112 ends, and NY 52 becomes maintained as CR 113. CR 113 and NY 52 turn northeast briefly along the northern shore of the lake, then leaving it and continuing northeast through Cochecton. Farms begin to break up the forest cover around the road more extensively here. At the junction with Shortcut Road, NY 52 turns to the north, reaching a junction in a half-mile with NY 17B and the eastern terminus of CR 114 (Newburgh Turnpike). At this junction, the small hamlet of Fosterdale, NY 17B turns north and joins NY 52, which becomes state-maintained again. The routes continue northward for , where they split. NY 17B turns northwest along CR 117; NY 52 bends northeast and soon northward as a state-maintained highway. The NY 52A and NY 52 junction north of Kenoza Lake along NY 52A. NY 52 continues northeast in the distance After crossing the Delaware town line, NY 52 bends east past a residential section around Pine Lake. At Mueller Road, NY 52 turns north and begins to run along the shore of Kenoza Lake. At the northern end of the lake, NY 52 reaches the hamlet of Kenoza Lake. The route turns northwest out of the small lakeside community, continuing north. Crossing the East Branch of Callicoon Creek, which it will follow to its source, NY 52 passes the southern end of Stone Arch Bridge Historic Park. After the bridge, NY 52 reaches the eastern terminus of NY 52A. NY 52 turns northeast along the creek, soon turning northward. The surrounding valley is now mostly cleared farmland. Two miles (3.2 km) from the NY 52A junction, NY 52 reaches the hamlet of Kohlertown.  Jeffersonville, Liberty, and Woodbourne  Just north of Kohlertown, NY 52 reaches a junction with the terminus of CR 164 (Beechwood Road). One block later, CR 128 (Jeffersonville North Branch Road) forks off to the northwest. At this junction, NY 52 turns northeast and crosses the town line into Callicoon. Here, this is also the boundary of Jeffersonville, the first village along the route. Downtown Jeffersonville NY 52 enters downtown Jeffersonville on East Main Street, with parking along both sides. It turns east at a junction with Center Street then bends southeast out of the village, following the northern shore of Lake Jefferson. Beyond the lake, the route bends northeast past a junction with CR 144 (Briscoe Road) then continues along the headwaters of the East Branch. At the junction with Hemmer Road, NY 52 bends northeast and soon eastward into the hamlet of Youngsville. There, it passes numerous residences, crosses over the creek and intersects the southern terminus of CR 149 (Shandelee Road). A half-mile west, the route crosses into the town of Liberty, slowly gaining elevation as the East Branch's valley narrows. Turning slightly southeast, NY 52 enters the hamlet of White Sulphur Springs, which it soon leaves after passing a local park. NY 52 continues winding southeast through a landscape with less farms and more forest, the surrounding hills growing increasingly higher and steeper. After passing south of the hamlet of Loomis, the route bends northeast again reaches the village of Liberty, the largest community thus far along NY 52\\\\. It turns due-east and follows Chestnut Street into the village. As the route becomes more commercial, NY 52 turns southeast at the intersection with North Main Street in the center of Liberty. Two village blocks later, NY 55 (Lake Street) joins it at the historic Munson Diner. The overlap goes to a roundabout to the east, where the two routes fork. NY 52 continues southeast along Mill Street, passing through an industrial section of Liberty before reaching a second roundabout. At this junction, the route connects with an off-ramp from the eastbound NY 17 expressway, now also Interstate 86. Paralleling NY 17, NY 52 continues south a short distance through an undeveloped area outside the village, then turns southeast to its actual exit with the freeway. At a junction with CR 175 (Old Route 17). NY 52 passes through a commercial strip mall section of Liberty, south of the Grossinger Country Club. Now on the Catskill Plateau, at elevations over above sea level, the route becomes rural again. Two and a half miles from Route 17 it bends northeast into the town of Fallsburg near a junction with CR 51 (Hilldale Road). Turning southeast again, NY 52 soon reaches a junction with CR 105 (Divine Corners Road). Turning southeast further, the route passes the northern entrance road Sullivan County Community College, the highest elevation on its entire length at , and then descends to the hamlet of Loch Sheldrake. Crossing through the center of the hamlet, the route passes just south of the actual Loch Sheldrake, then reaches an intersection with CR 104 (Loch Sheldrake Hurleyville Road), the center of the small community. At the eastern end of the hamlet, the route passes north of Evens Lake. NY 52 turns east again, through increasingly wooded countryside, soon changing over to a commercial-residential road and running southeast for a short distance. The route soon bends northeast as it descends toward the hamlet of Woodbourne, where NY 42 joins Route 52 from the south. The two routes curve past residences to Woodbourne's small downtown, then cross the Neversink River. Immediately east of that bridge, NY 42 turns north toward Grahamsville, ending the brief concurrency. NY 52 turns southeast past Woodbourne Correctional Facility to the south, over the south side of a small unnamed hill and then into Ulster County approximately one mile to the east. = Ulster County = Now in the town of Wawarsing, NY 52 bends southeast into an area that remains heavily forested along the next 10 miles (16 km) as it gradually descends off the Catskill Plateau to Ellenville. The route follows a straight course to the southeast past the small residential hamlet of Dairyland, passing a junction with CR 53A (Milk Road). Four miles (6.4 km) further east, it passes another similar small hamlet, Greenfield Park, and bends back to the east a mile after passing the north end of Windsor Lake. NY 52 leaves Dairyland, crossing southeast through Wawarsing into the residential hamlet of Greenfield Park and past Windsor Lake, the source of the West Branch of the Beer Kill, which it follows to Ellenville. East of the lake, the route bends northeastward for two more miles, crossing through some dense woods between steep hillsides and paralleling Old Greenfield Road. Both roads soon bend northward, as the woods recede to more residences. As the West Branch drains into the main Beer Kill, just outside Ellenville, NY 52 reaches a junction with CR 53 (Briggs Street). The eastern end of NY 52's split through Ellenville After re-paralleling, NY 52 continues southeast, reaching the terminus of CR 53 (Old Greenfield Road). Entering Ellenville, the largest village on the route since Liberty, NY 52 divides. NY 52 runs down both Center Street and Canal Street. A few blocks into the village, NY 52 has its only intersection in Ulster County with a numbered route above the county level, US 209 (Main Street). The Shawangunk Ridge looms ahead. The route, on both Canal and Center, then crosses the village's downtown, lower than its peak at SCCC. In the residential section that follows the Sandburg Creek crossing, one of the cross streets, Towpath Lane, marks the former route of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, a National Historic Landmark. NY 52 bends southward, where Canal and Center Streets merge, taking the latter's name. At the village line, it becomes Mountain Avenue. Over the next three miles (4.8 km), NY 52 climbs over a thousand feet (300 m) to the crest of the Shawangunk Ridge. This section offers several overlooks on the west side with views of the Catskills to the north and northwest and the valley below. The route itself passes rock outcrops, some with fencing to prevent the road from being blocked off, and steep wooded slopes. Near the base of the climb aqua paint blazes on signposts at the roadside indicate the brief presence of the Long Path hiking trail. NY 52 climbing the Shawangunks Near the top of the ridge, signs point north on CR 104 (Cragsmoor Road) to the hamlet of Cragsmoor, as NY 52 reaches the apex of the ridge, at in elevation having regained almost all the altitude lost on the way to Ellenville. As it begins to descend through dense woods of scrub oak, NY 52 enters the town of Shawangunk, very near the Sullivan County line. Shortly afterward, a clearing at a house below one bend in the steep road offers a panoramic view east, towards the Hudson River with the Hudson Highlands also visible. The route winds southeast and levels out at the hamlet of Walker Valley, having descended from the heights of the ridge. Just southeast of Walker Valley, NY 52 crosses a junction with CR 65 (Weed Road). The brief breaks in the forest cover from the hamlet end. A mile beyond, NY 52 turns east, then bends northeast. At Verkeerderkill Park, CR 7 (Burlingham Road), merges in from the southeast. Here more cleared farmland begins to break up the forest. At the junction with New Prospect and Pirog roads, CR 7 turns off northeast, following the former. NY 52 turns southeast and, three- quarters of a mile () later, crosses the Orange County line at Shawangunk Kill. = Orange County = Across the bridge is the large hamlet of Pine Bush, part of the town of Crawford. NY 52's first intersection is the northern terminus of NY 302 (Maple Avenue). Known as Main Street, NY 52 crosses southeast through downtown Pine Bush for its next half-mile (800 m). The countryside beyond is primarily farms with some woodlots, the gently rolling terrain offering views north to the upper Shawangunks. Route 52 approaching Walden Three-quarters of a mile past Pine Bush, CR 89 (Hill Avenue) forks off to the southeast. Afterwards a slight descent heralds the Dwaar Kill crossing, the route remains a two-lane rural roadway through northern Orange County. A rise through a more wooded area culminates in the Montgomery town line at CR 17 (Fleury Road), where the landscape opens up again. Continuing straight southeast past farms and some newer subdivisions, the route reaches CR 14 (Albany Post Road). At Rider Road, a half-mile further on, NY 52 curves further to the southeast, taking it across a wide swath of farmland into the village of Walden, the largest settlement along the route. It follows first residential North Montgomery Street, which becomes South Montgomery Street at the Oak Street intersection, marked by a few small businesses. At the junction with Walker Street, NY 52 turns sharply eastward, becoming West Main Street while South Montgomery Street continues towards the village of Montgomery via CR 29\\\\. Immediately following this turn, NY 52 crosses the Walden Veterans' Memorial Bridge over the Wallkill River, entering the center of Walden. Conspicuous here is the brick tower of Walden United Methodist Church. After several blocks, West Main reaches an intersection with local Bank Street on the north, NY 208 (Ulster Avenue) ahead, and Main Street to the southeast. It joins NY 208 on Main. Parallel roadways in eastern Walden along NY 52 The two routes fork a short two blocks later at Orange Avenue, which NY 208 follows toward Maybrook while NY 52 continues east as East Main Street. A quarter-mile (400 m) beyond, at the first of the route's several crossings of Wallkill tributary Tin Brook, the houses on the north side of the road start to have a deep setback, reflecting a past division of NY 52 at this point. The second roadway remains in use from Woodruff Avenue to the village's eastern boundary. Past Walden, NY 52 passes several businesses, then Wallkill Valley Cemetery on the south. A mile west of there, just past another crossing of Tin Brook, CR 85 (St. Andrew's Road), leaves from the north. Past East Walden, the route becomes a two-lane rural road, bending southeast at a junction with Old South Plank Road. The landscape remains the same gently rolling countryside of worked fields it was between Walden and Pine Bush. The last two crossings of Tin Brook, a mile and a half () east of CR 85 precede a bend to the southeast. The woods on the side of the road increase here as NY 52 climbs slightly after the Catskill Aqueduct crosses a half-mile from that turn. In another half- mile, the route returns to its more easterly course as it enters the town of Newburgh and takes the name South Plank Road at the intersection with Old South Plank Road and Cooks Lane. After passing a swampy area in the woods to the north, NY 52 intersects CR 23 (Rock Cut Road), then runs through swamps along the southern shore of Orange Lake on an eastward heading. Immediately afterwards, a single intersection marks the very small commercial center of the hamlet of Orange Lake. Just past the hamlet, NY 52 turns southeast again at a junction with Monarch Drive and enters an area where woods screen residential neighborhoods off the route. It is paralleled on the north by Bushfield Creek, which drains Orange Lake. With both the creek and route going past a large hill on the south, NY 52 bends southeast again to cross under the New York State Thruway (I-87). A commercial strip begins shortly after the Thruway, continuing a half-mile past it to the junction with NY 300 (Union Avenue) at the center of the hamlet of Gardnertown. The strip continues another half-mile to the Powder Mill Road where the route runs along the southern side of Algonquin Powder Mill Park, where it becomes residential again. In the wetlands north of the route past the park, as the route bends around another hill to the south, Bushfield Creek flows into Quassaick Creek, which itself flows under NY 52 just above the now-drained Winona Lake south of the road. Here the route turns more to the south. Just after the junction with Fifth Avenue, a thousand feet past the lake, the route crosses over Interstate 84 at that route's exit 37\\\\. Just after the overpass, NY 52 turns eastward down the onramp and merges with the interstate. The four-lane expressway is the only section of NY 52 not to be a two-lane surface road, and is its last and longest concurrency. The two routes follow the northern border of the city of Newburgh northeast and then east. At Exit 39, a mile and a half (2.4 km) from the merger, US 9W (Albany Post Road north of the exit, North Robinson Avenue south of it) and NY 32 intersect just south of the end of their overlap. NY 32 follows North Plank Road as it turns inland towards New Paltz, while US 9W continues to parallel the river north to Marlboro and Highland. Crossing the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge eastbound After exit 39, NY 52 and I-84 continue east between the city of Newburgh on the south and the town's affluent residential hamlet of Balmville to the north. The expressway widens to six lanes as it reaches the twin spans of the Hamilton Fish Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. Just before crossing over the Hudson River, the routes cross over the CSX West Shore Railroad. In the middle of the wide crossing of the river's Newburgh Bay, the routes enter Dutchess County. To the south the cities of Beacon and Newburgh frame a view of the northern Hudson Highlands, including Beacon Mountain, Breakneck Ridge and Storm King. To the north marinas at Chelsea and New Hamburg are visible on the river's east side, with the Roseton and Danskammer power plants standing out on the west. = Dutchess County = On the east side of the Hudson, NY 52 and I-84 cross over Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line just north of the Beacon station, visible from the bridge. They pass briefly through the northern corner of the city of Beacon, where the bridge's tolls ($1.50 for cars paying cash, $1.25 for EZPass users, and more for trucks) is collected from eastbound traffic. Immediately afterwards is the town of Fishkill and Exit 41. NY 9D crosses, taking traffic north towards Wappingers Falls and south into Beacon. NY 52 Business begins here along the latter direction. After the exit, the routes narrow to four lanes again and bend northeast, passing Dutchess Stadium on the north. Prominent on a hilltop south of the road is Fishkill Correctional Facility. As the expressway bends eastward again, high chainlink fences with concertina wire surround the concrete buildings of another prison, Downstate Correctional Facility, on the north. Signs warn drivers not to stop due to the proximity of both facilities. A mile and a half (2.4 km) further east, after passing through a rock cut and going over undulating terrain in a woody area, the routes turn southeast into Exit 44. Here NY 52 Business completes its loop from the south, and NY 52 leaves the interstate after . It closely parallels I-84 for the remainder of its route. Historic downtown Fishkill along NY 52 NY 52 passes through a residential area as a two-lane surface road as it heads northeast from I-84. A quarter-mile (400 m) from the interchange, it enters the village of Fishkill, the last along its route. As Main Street, it soon becomes heavily developed, with businesses on both sides. Jackson Street, which soon becomes CR 34, leaves to the north midway through the village. Downtown culminates in the intersection with US 9, a divided four-lane commercial strip at this point. On the other side of US 9, NY 52 becomes Hopewell Avenue. It passes through some residential and less intensely commercial areas before leaving the village after a quarter-mile, still following a northeast heading. The next mile closely parallels both Fishkill Creek and Metro-North's infrequently-used Beacon Line. At the small hamlet of Brinckerhoff, the route bends southeast to cross them both as NY 82 continues northeast towards Hopewell Junction. Three-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) later, after bending around Honess Mountain, NY 52 crosses the East Fishkill town line at the hamlet of Wiccopee. It curves northeast again and soon passes the large IBM manufacturing facilities and the Hudson Valley Research Park on the south. CR 31 (Palen Road) leaves from the north in the middle of this mile- long stretch. Just after the park, CR 27 (Lime Kiln Road), a divided four-lane surface road, leaves to the south, connecting to I-84 at Exit 50. NY 52 turns more to the northeast for a half-mile, then bends slightly southeast past a swampy area that precedes the center of East Fishkill. Just before the small Gayhead Pond north of the route, NY 376 leaves, ultimately turning west towards Poughkeepsie. From that intersection the route continues east, then turns northeast after a half-mile. After another half-mile, NY 52 crosses under the Taconic State Parkway, its last junction with a limited-access route. Both entrance ramps to the parkway are on the south side of the route. A quarter-mile (400 m) from the parkway, CR 29 (Carpenter Road) forks off to the north. Over the mile (1.6 km) after the interchange, the route slowly curves back eastward through an area of residential side streets. Then NY 216 forks off to the northeast, leading to Green Haven Correctional Facility and the hamlet of Stormville. I-84 overpasses vaulting above NY 52 in the town of East Fishkill For the next half-mile (800 m) NY 52 passes through a more wooded area, then turns southeastward again. After another half-mile, the route turns due south and begins to climb steeply into the wooded foothills of the Taconic Mountains through a narrow creek valley. I-84 crosses overhead, on a very high overpass. A half-mile further on from that, the Appalachian Trail (AT) crosses the route. The route turns again a quarter-mile (400 m) from the AT to follow a more easterly course. The terrain levels out into a minimally developed area of small bumps and wetlands. After another three-quarters of a mile, NY 52 reaches its highest elevation east of the Hudson, above sea level, at the Mountain Top Road intersection. NY 52 turns southeast again and reaches the hamlet of Pecksville after a mile (1.6 km). There it has a staggered junction with CR 30 (Milltown Road on the south, then Holmes Road on the north). The route draws closer to I-84 and turns southeast. Three-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) from Pecksville, with Mill Pond between it and the interstate, NY 52 crosses the Putnam County line. = Putnam County = Immediately after crossing the county line, NY 52 enters the hamlet of Ludingtonville, part of the town of Kent. It consists of a few houses and some businesses, primarily gas stations that serve traffic from I-84's adjacent exit 58 for CR 40 (Ludingtonville Road). At that junction, the route is headed due south. It turns southwest briefly, then southeast again. NY 52 at the NY 311 junction at Lake Carmel The next run almost straight through wooded, hilly country, getting further east of the interstate. Eventually NY 52 reaches the west shore of a small northern bay of Lake Carmel, center of the residential community of that name. Shortly afterward NY 311 branches off to the east on a short causeway across the lake. It is a mile (1.6 km) back to I-84's exit 61 via NY 311, the last connection between the interstate and NY 52 although their routes still run parallel. NY 52 continues along the western shore of the lake for another mile. Just past its south end, it intersects with CR 45 (Towners Road). After turning southwest the route intersects CR 48 (Horse Pound Road). A thousand feet (300 m) south of that junction, NY 52 reaches the town of Carmel. The route bends southward again, passing Raymond Hill Cemetery, then a large strip mall on the westbound direction. NY 52 follows Gleneida Avenue, the main street of the hamlet of Carmel, the county seat, with businesses on both sides. A mile from the town line, just across from the old county courthouse, NY 301 ends its journey from Cold Spring. Just past the junction is Lake Gleneida, part of the New York City water supply system, the center of a park on that side of the route. A quarter-mile further on, at Reed Memorial Library, NY 52 ends at a three-way junction with US 6. History Similar to many state highways in the region, NY 52 follows a number of roads originally built as private turnpikes during the early 19th century. While the turnpikes made significant improvements to very poor roads, they were not popular with the public and eventually failed, leaving their roads for the county or state to maintain. =Predecessor turnpikes= One of these, the Woodbourne and Ellenville Turnpike Company, connected those two communities. After being incorporated by the New York Legislature in 1830, it built and opened a turnpike from Ellenville on the Delaware and Hudson Canal west to Woodbourne in 1838, and later extended it further in that direction to Liberty. To the east of Ellenville, the Newburgh and Ellenville Plank Road Company was proposed in late 1849 to build and charge tolls on a plank road between Ellenville and Newburgh, major markets on the canal and Hudson respectively, and incorporated the following year. The company decided shortly thereafter to build on a southern route; the supporters of a northern route organized the Newburgh and Shawangunk Plank Road two weeks later. Both roads were completed in December 1851; an opening celebration for the Newburgh and Ellenville was held at Ellenville that month. The south route is now, with some modifications, part of NY 52\\\\. In 1895 the Walden and Orange Lake Railroad, later part of the Orange County Traction Company, built a trolley line along the old turnpike between Orange Lake, then the end of a suburban line from Newburgh, and Walden. It carried passengers and freight, including milk, until its demise in 1925. Other former turnpikes used by NY 52 include short lengths of the Jeffersonville and Monticello Turnpike (Jeffersonville to Briscoe Road), Ulster and Orange Branch Turnpike (Liberty to Cross Farm Road), Philipstown Turnpike (Pecksville to Ludingtonville), and Putnam and Dutchess Turnpike (Ludingtonville to the end in Carmel). By the 1890s, the entire route that would become NY 52 existed as public or turnpike roads. Accessed via the David Rumsey Map Collection. =Public ownership= After the demise of the turnpikes, the State Commission of Highways was created by the legislature in 1898 to improve and maintain state highways. In 1909, a connected network of routes was laid out by the legislature; none of the present NY 52 was included. It was also not part of the system of signed state routes numbered in 1924. By 1926, Route 39 was signed from Poughkeepsie to Patterson, using a short piece of modern NY 52 between East Fishkill and Stormville. =Formal designation= NY 52 was designated as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. West of East Fishkill, NY 52 was assigned to its current routing along a previously unnumbered road through downstate New York to the Pennsylvania state line; however, it was several years before NY 52 as a whole was improved and paved. At its west end, NY 52 connected with US 106, which had been designated in 1926 and ended at the Delaware River on the Pennsylvania state line. US 106 was never extended into New York, and is now PA 652 near the border. To the east of East Fishkill, the newly designated NY 52 used the old alignment of 1920s Route 39 from East Fishkill to West Patterson, where 52 continued along previously unnumbered roads south to Carmel, then east to NY 22 at Sears Corners (northeast of Brewster) over modern NY 311, US 6, and NY 312, as well as its modern alignment from Lake Carmel to Carmel.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering At the time, modern NY 52 from Stormville to Ludingtonville (northwest of Lake Carmel) was designated as part of NY 216. NY 52 and NY 216 mostly swapped alignments in the area ; NY 52 was rerouted onto its modern alignment between Stormville and Lake Carmel, utilizing the portion of NY 216 from Stormville and Ludingtonville as well as a new roadway between Ludingtonville and Lake Carmel while NY 216 was relocated to the old Route 39 alignment (Stormville-Poughquag-West Patterson). The original NY 52 segment from West Patterson to Lake Carmel was assigned as an extension of NY 311\\\\. NY 52 was also truncated to its present terminus in Carmel at this time. =Realignments and detours= The only major change to NY 52's routing since then came with the opening of the Newburgh‚ÄìBeacon Bridge in 1963. Prior to then, NY 52 had crossed the Hudson River on the Newburgh-Beacon Ferry, approaching from the west on Dupont Avenue and Broadway (overlapping NY 17K on Broadway) and from the east on Fishkill Avenue and Wolcott Avenue (now mostly NY 52 Business). Natural disasters and construction have forced temporary closures and re-routings in some areas. At the end of 2002, a rockslide along the stretch climbing the Shawangunks east of Ellenville buried an 85-foot (25 m) section of the road with an estimated 1,000 cubic yards (800 m¬≥) of rock and dirt. The state Department of Transportation closed the road temporarily. Automobile traffic was detoured via several local roads; trucks had to make a lengthy side trip via Route 17 During the 2003‚Äì2005 construction of the new bridge over the Wallkill River in Walden, NY 52 was routed to Walden's other bridge (the \\"Low Bridge\\") via Oak Street, which intersects the highway twice within the village. This required the erection of two temporary traffic signals, causing some new traffic problems in the village. Truck traffic was detoured to NY 17K via Albany Post Road and Stone Castle Road. Future The congested eastern end of the NY 208 overlap in Walden. The village of Walden has noted, in its 2019 Comprehensive Plan, the difficulties created by the oblique intersection at the eastern end of the Route 208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy gas station. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut. Some are often stranded in the middle of the intersection when turning between the two highways. A 2009 traffic study found the intersection at level of service D, during peak hours with the potential to reach \\"F\\" within five years. The layout of the intersection is very poor for trucks making this turn; they have caused damage to the curb. The congestion that all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to the use of side streets, the village believes, since traffic counts have been going up on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency. It has prohibited all trucks over from any road in the village except the two state highways and certain side streets, and continues to monitor the situation with the hope of eventually signalizing the junction. Major intersections New York State Route 52A New York State Route 52A is a alternate route of NY 52 in western Sullivan County. The route begins at NY 17B near the hamlet of Fosterdale and continues north and east to its terminus at NY 52 near the north end of Kenoza Lake. It serves mainly to shorten the trip from Callicoon to Liberty via NY 52 as without it drivers on NY 17B would have to go out of their way to reach the junction. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. New York State Route 52 Business New York State Route 52 Business (abbreviated NY 52 Bus.) is a business route of NY 52 that extends for through the city of Beacon in Dutchess County. The route is signed as east-west, starting at I-84 / NY 52 exit 41 and NY 9D north of Beacon and ending at I-84 / NY 52 exit 44 southwest of the village of Fishkill, where NY 52 leaves I-84, ending the I-84 / NY 52 concurrency. NY 52 Business is not posted on guide signs on I-84. NY 52 Business begins at I-84 / NY 52 exit 11 and runs concurrent with NY 9D into Beacon. At Main Street, NY 52 Business leaves NY 9D and follows Main Street east through the Lower Main Street Historic District and across town to Fishkill Avenue. The route turns left onto that street, following Fishkill Avenue out of the city. At Prospect Street, a local road straddling the Beacon city line, NY 52 Business becomes state-maintained as NY 980J, an unsigned reference route. After Millholland Drive, Fishkill Avenue becomes Fishkill's Main Street before meeting I-84 / NY 52\\\\. At the interchange, NY 52 Business, as well as the NY 980J designation, comes to an end while NY 52 continues east along Main Street.

He also served in a number of ministerial posts on the island and is therefore a former member of the Council of Ministers. Personal life Gawne was born in Douglas to C. R. Gawne CP and E. Gawne (n√©e Anderson). He attended his local primary school in Arbory, before joining Castle Rushen High School for his secondary education. As a young adult, Gawne moved to Liverpool to study Biochemistry in the University of Liverpool. On his return to the Isle of Man, he retrained as a chartered accountant. Gawne has been married to Catherine (n√©e Kissack) since 1991; they have two children and live in the hamlet of Surby, near Port Erin in the south of the island.  Politics  Gawne has been involved with nationalist politics for much of his political career. In the 1980s he was a member of Mec Vannin, a small political party aimed at gaining full independence and establishing the Isle of Man as an independent sovereign state. During the 1980s he was involved with a nationalist campaign that ended with an arson attack on an uncompleted luxury home in Tromode, Douglas. In 1988 he was sent to prison for 16 months, serving 8 months, for his part in this arson attack. Gawne first became a Member of the House of Keys in 2003. He served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry from 2005 until 2010, then as Minister for Infrastructure 2010‚Äì11 and 2014‚Äì16, and also as Minister for the Environment, Food and Agriculture 2011‚Äì14. Following constituency boundary changes to the Isle of Man's political map, Gawne contested the newly formed Arbory, Castletown & Malew constituency at the 2016 Manx General Election. The seat was contested by a total of seven candidates with Gawne polling the third highest number of votes, thus losing his parliamentary seat. The contest was close, with Gawne losing by a total of 19 votes after two recounts.  Manx language  Gawne is a fluent speaker of the Manx language and has been involved with the Manx language for decades. He served as the Manx Language Development Officer (Yn Greinneyder), and has also been chairman of Culture Vannin (Manx Heritage Foundation) since 2004. In 1996, Gawne also helped to found Feailley Ghaelgagh (Manx Language Festival), following a research trip to Scottish Gaelic development agencies in Inverness and the Isle of Skye.Gawne, Phil. \\"Securing the Future of Manx Gaelic\\". http://www.poileasaidh.celtscot.ed.ac.uk/gawneseminar.html Retrieved 17 July 2020. Feailley Ghaelgagh was later renamed The Cooish. Gawne was instrumental in passing the 2001 Education Act that allowed for the Manx language to be taught on the island's schools: > I believe this is one of the things that I‚Äôve been pretty strong on, if not > the main person, it was getting Manx history, language and culture into the > 2001 Education Act.

During this time the city was also the seat of a Christian bishopric.Eintrag in catholic-hierarchy.org (englisch) =Pirate base= Much later, it became an important base for the Barbary corsairs. Following the conquest of Tunisia by CharlesV in 1534 and 1535, Spaniards tried to remove the pirates unsuccessfully. John of Austria also visited the bay during his reconquest of Tunis in October of 1573, following his victory at Lepanto. The Italian convert, Ottoman corsair, and Tunisian dey Usta Murad expanded the citythen known as PortoFarinagreatly enough to consider it a second founding. He established fortifications to prevent the harbor's use by Christian powers and attracted refugee Moriscos by the provision of certain liberties at Porto Farina, Rafraf, and Ras el-Djebel. During this era, it rivaled the size and importance of Bizerte. In early 1655, an English fleet under Robert Blake blockaded nine warships in Porto Farina's harbor in order to pressure the dey Mustafa Laz to free Englishmen held as slaves and to provide compensation for English ships recently seized by local pirates. The dey offered to provide a new treaty going forward but refused emancipation or compensation for people and ships already taken. Any such action, he felt, should begin with the English, one of whose captains had recently sold a company of Tunisian troops as galley slaves to the Knights of Malta instead of transporting them to Smyrna (present-day Izmir) as arranged. When Blake maintained his blockade, the dey had his warships' rigging removed, the town's fortifications strengthened, and its garrison increased. On April 14, 1655, Blake finally attacked. Dividing his fleet to attack the warships and the 20-gun fort simultaneously, he had his men storm and burn the warships in turn before declaring victory and leaving the harbor. Because his sustained assault was able to silence the town's defenses entirely, the engagement is celebrated as the first successful naval attack on shore-based fortifications. The port and its defenses were then quickly rebuilt. The Ottoman Empire erected Borj el- Loutani as a fort in 1659; Fort Nadur and the \\"Genovese fort\\" were also raised around the same time. Borj el-Loutani was later used as an artillery base and as a prison; the others gradually fell into disrepair. The town began to be used by British and Maltese privateers, as well as Turkish and local corsairs. Muhammad Talak and Ali Bey were arrested and strangled in Porto Farina in 1682 as part of the chaotic struggles of the later Muradid dynasty. Shortly afterward, three ships arriving from Turkey proper infected the town with the plague. When Husain I took advantage of Ibrahim Sharif's Algerian imprisonment to usurp control of Tunisia in 1705, the Algerians released Sharif to return home. Husain, intent upon consolidating his power, had Sharif killed en route at Porto Farina. The former dey's tomb lies beside one of the town's forts.. Husain established an arsenal at Porto Farina two years later. Locals were calling the town Ghar el-Melh (recorded by a visiting Frenchman as \\"Gramela\\") by 1724. French annoyance at piracy in the area prompted to order an attack in 1770 by Admiral de Broves, commanding a squadron consisting of 2 warships (bearing 74 and 50 guns respectively), 2 frigates (24 guns each), a bark (18 guns), 2 schooners, a flute, and some other ships provided by Malta. The ships fired on Porto Farina for two days. De Brove's fleet also attacked Bizerte and Monastir. before the Treaty of Bardo ended hostilities on August 25th. Similarly, when Venice took exception to Tunisian-based piracy in the early 1780s, its leaders ordered a series of bombardments that included an attack by Admiral Emo's fleet on Porto Farina on September 6, 1784. This seems, however, to have been the last time a foreign fleet bothered the port; by 1806, it was only a winter port for the bey's warships and it was necessary to take special measures each voyage to get them over the harbor's rising sandbar. The beylik's arsenal was finally removed in 1818, but fear that a similar fate might befall its navy as had Algeria's caused the bey to hire dredgers and workers to improve conditions.; he was again able to bring his fleet into the harbor by December. When a severe storm destroyed the beylik's fleet at anchor off La Goulette on February 7 & 8, 1821, however, such efforts were discontinued and the sandbar off Porto Farina was allowed to continue to grow. =Modern town= In 1834 a large private arsenal belonging to a Maltese pirate exploded and destroyed part of the town. Ahmed Bey, the last Bey of Constantine, decided to clamp down on piracy and attempted to turn the port over to legitimate trade. In 1837, he began efforts to restore the town's arsenal. Although that never proved feasible, the bey established a palace in the city and an attendant garrison. Command was given to a favorite of the bey's, the general Salah Cheboul. The forts were renovated, and the port cleaned and maintained. From 1840, a community of Maltese, Italians, and French settled in the locality.. By 1853, however, the beylik's new frigates could no longer access the harbor and the garrison was reduced. In the early years of Tunisia's French occupation, the Bizerte Port Company () made an attempt to again dredge access to Porto Farina's harbor but a storm from the northeast closed the channel almost immediately after its opening and further attempts were abandoned. The formerly prosperous town's public buildings had already fallen into disrepair and were thoroughly scavenged by locals for other purposes. The prison, which was listed as a Tunisian Historic Monument in 1922, closed in 1964.

Geography  It is situated on the Saale River, approx. north of Bernburg, and southeast of Magdeburg. It is known as Calbe an der Saale, to distinguish it from the smaller town of Kalbe on the Milde in the same state. Pop. (1905) 12,281. It is a railway junction, and among its industries are wool-weaving and the manufacture of cloth, paper, stoves, sugar and bricks. Cucumbers and onions are cultivated, and soft coal is mined in the neighborhood. The town has a statue of Roland outside its city hall. Roland is a symbol who represents many small and medium-sized towns in Saxony-Anhalt, symbolising free trade and prosperity. The town also has a very old church , and a tower known as the \\"Hexenturm\\" (\\"Witchtower\\"), in which the townspeople imprisoned accused witches and tortured them in the Middle Ages. The river Saale runs on the east side of the town, and over a weir. This is a small kind of dam where the water flows over the structure allowing passage of shallow draft barges up or down ‚Äî moreover rather than being channeled through it the water is used off this flow to generate energy and it raises the water level only a relatively small amount. At the weir the Saale is partly diverted, while some of the river flows over the weir and continues on its natural path, the rest is channeled through an artificial path, known as \\"M√ºhlgraben\\". This takes the water between two (now abandon) buildings which used to harness the power of the water to mill grain into flour, and the other to make paper. After flowing between the mills the water continues on an artificial path for a couple of miles before returning to the Saale proper. The small island of land between the Saale and the artificial \\"M√ºhlgraben\\" is called \\"Heger\\" in German. The local sports area and the swimming bath are located at the island. The island is connected to the city of Calbe by a bridge on the far side and also by a small ferry on the opposite side, which swings back and forth between the urban district \\"Gottesgnaden\\" (engl.: God's Grace) and island using an anchor and cable system. The name of the town comes from the verb \\"kalben\\", which means to calf (for a cow to give birth) in German, but it could also come from the Latin adjective \\"calvus\\", what describes a bleak landscape. Calbe is famous for Bismarck's tower, which is located at the Wartenberg and the long tradition for growing onions, which are regionally called \\"Bollen\\".

On November 21, 1978, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places, under the title of Payne's Creek Massacre-Fort Chokonikla Site (also known as \\"site of Chokonikla blockhouse and bridge\\" or \\"Military cemetery\\"). History =After the Second Seminole War= When the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, the federal Armed Occupation Act was passed. It let Seminole War veterans apply for a homestead in Florida. At the same time, a reservation was created for the Seminoles in southwest Florida. Their ability to trade was limited by the government, so as to prevent them from obtaining weapons to cause further conflict. To compensate, white-run trading stores were permitted on the reservation's outskirts to the north and west, letting the Indians obtain supplies and luxuries unavailable within the reservation. Many of the trading posts were built by Kennedy and Darling, two army sutlers from Fort Brooke who had started their own trading company. One such was constructed in the late 1840s along the Charlo-popka-hatchee-chee (Little Trout-Eating Creek in Seminole), west of Peas Creek (later known as the Peace River), near present-day Bowling Green. The proprietors were Capt. George Payne and Dempsey Whidden. =The massacre= Ignoring the terms of the treaty with the Seminoles, settlers moved southward, encroaching on the reservation. Though Billy Bowlegs, one of their leaders, was reconciled to the state of affairs, others of his people were not so compliant. On July 17, 1849, Payne and Whidden were killed by five renegade Seminoles, following which the store and everything in it was burned. =Fort Chokonikla= Site of the old fort The attack on the trading post caused many of the settlers to flee to the nearest fort, then ask for military forces to be sent so they could return to their homes in safety. This led to the establishment of Fort Chokonikla near the site of the former trading post only three months later, on October 26. The fort's name is believed to derive from the Seminole \\"Chocka-nickler\\" meaning \\"burnt store\\". It was also variously spelled at the time as \\"Chokkonickla\\" or \\"Chokhonikla\\". Footpath in park Following the fort's completion, the nearby creek became known as Paynes Creek, which it is still called to this day. However, due to its location near a swamp, a breeding site for mosquitos, many of those stationed at the fort contracted and died of malaria. This became such a problem that the fort's doctor recommended the fort's closure. The army quickly agreed, and the fort was vacated on July 18, 1850, after less than nine months of occupancy, and a year and a day after Payne and Whidden's deaths. Recreational activities Activities include canoeing, kayaking, fishing, geocaching, and bird and butterfly watching. Amenities include a number of historic sites, three picnic pavilions, and a museum at the visitor's center that recreates pioneer life. Hours Florida state parks are open between 8 am and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

Born into a musical family in 1941, Dimond started playing piano at the age of five, learned the guitar when he was 17 years old and added the banjo at age 30. He attended Grinnell College in Iowa and then moved to New York, where he worked as an editor on True Experience for McFadden-Bartell while writing scripts for Warren Publishing and Web of Horror. In addition to contributions to Castle of Frankenstein, he was an editor for publisher Martin Goodman's magazine For Men Only. Recordings Performing in Colorado, Dimond plays bluegrass, Celtic, folk, jazz, classical and rock, and his studio is mainly devoted to recording and producing the work of Colorado musicians. Dimond can be heard playing banjo, keyboard and guitar and reading poetry on Little Orphan Aliens (Good Food Entertainment, 2001), followed by Good Food's Planet O Live and More (2003). He produced the CD Incarnation (American Primitive Records, 1994), featuring actor-vocalist Tucker Smallwood and guitarist Arlen Roth. Dimond wrote about illustrator Wally Wood for Bhob Stewart's biographical anthology, Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood (TwoMorrows, 2003). His essay, \\"From the Woodwork Out,\\" examines life and art in the Upper West Side where Wood's studio was located during the 1960s, and the book also features his interview, \\"Geronimo!\\", with artist John Severin. Fiction Fiction by Dimond includes \\"You Can't Fire Me for Doing My Job\\" in New Black Mask 7 (1986). When his mystery novel, No- Frills Mystery, was published by Jove Books in 1981, it was described by The New York Times as \\"a classic of the genre.\\" He collaborated with science fiction novelist Terry Bisson on several stories for Warren Publishing's Creepy and Eerie.

It comprises the Polish section of the Sto≈Çowe Mountains (G√≥ry Sto≈Çowe), also known as the Table Mountains in English, which are part of the Sudetes range. It is located in K≈Çodzko County of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, at the border with the Czech Republic. Created in 1993, the Park covers an area of , of which forests accounts for 57.79 km¬≤. The area of strict protection is 3.76 km¬≤. History The landscape of Sto≈Çowe Mountains began to form 70 million years ago. The range‚Äôs unique shape is a result of hundreds of thousands of years of erosion. There are several notable rock formations, among them Kwoka (\\"Hen\\"), Wielblad (\\"Camel\\") and Glowa wielkoluda (\\"Giant‚Äôs head\\"). Also, there is a sophisticated system of corridors which creates rock labyrinths. Currently plant life is mostly made up of spruce, which was introduced to the area on the turn of the 19th century to replace pristine beech and fir forests, which had been cut. Natural woodland is scarce and covers only around 3% of the forested areas. There are peat bogs, one of which (area 393,000 m¬≤) was listed as a strictly protected area in 1959. In the forested areas of the park there are deer, red deer, wild pig, squirrels, hedgehogs, many birds and reptiles including lizards and adders.  Flora  The characteristic flora of the Great Peatbog Batorowski, one of the few raised peat bogs in Poland, is represented by species such as marsh pine, marsh or ordinary heater. This peatbog has been subject to strict protection since 1958, and unfortunately visitors to the G√≥ry Sto≈Çowe National Park are not allowed on these sites. Inhabitation The history of the Sto≈Çowe Mountains is closely connected with the history of the K≈Çodzko region, located on the borderland of Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia. After Hussite wars of the 14th and 15th century, the area thrived and later on first spas at Kudowa, Duszniki and Polanica were opened. Duszniki is also a center of paper production - one of the first paper mills in Europe was opened there in 1605.

Geography  = Location = The municipality lies in the southern Eifel in the √ú√übach valley near the Moselle. = Constituent communities = Bad Bertrich's Ortsteile are the main centre, also called Bad Bertrich, and the outlying centre of Kennfus.  History  Even as long ago as Roman Emperors Valentinian's and Gratian‚Äôs time, stately bathing houses were being built in Bertriacum. In 1097, Bad Bertrich had its first documentary mention in an ownership document from Archbishop Egilbert of Trier. In 1476, the village became an Electoral-Trier state-owned spa. Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, the last Elector of Trier, had the little Electoral palace built here between 1785 and 1787, and used it as a summer seat and a hunting lodge. Beginning in 1794, Bad Bertrich lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna, whereupon it became a Prussian state-owned spa. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. On 1 January 1975, the until then self-administering municipality of Kennfus was amalgamated with Bad Bertrich. = 2006 FIFA World Cup = For the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Bad Bertrich served as the Swiss national football team‚Äôs training camp.

Its name is part of a legend in which the villainous archbishop Hatto of Mainz plays a major role. To eradicate poverty, he had a number of poor people burnt in a shed, ironically commenting on their death cries: \\"Hear, hear how the mice squeak!\\" As punishment by the heavens he was plagued by mice, and he fled to the tower to secure himself. But the mice crossed the Rhine to the island, penetrated the tower, and devoured the bishop alive.  History  = Roman Empire = During the construction of the railway in the 1850s, an extensive Roman graveyard was found. = Middle Ages = In 1150, Hildegard von Bingen founded the Rupertsberg convent in Bingerbr√ºck. It was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War in 1632. Ruins of the cellar remained as the foundation of the former Herter-Villa and were finally destroyed during the construction of the railway. = Nineteenth century = After the Congress of Vienna, the Nahe became the border between Prussia's Rhine Province and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The Nahe bridge became an important customs point, contributing to the rapid growth of Bingerbr√ºck. = World War II = The railway area was the target of at least seven severe bombing raids. Even today, dud bombs are frequently found.  Railway  Bingerbr√ºck, lying at the junction of the Left Rhine Railway (Mainz-Koblenz) and the Nahe Valley Railway to Metz, was one of the most important railway junctions of the German Empire.

Reception  In a 1991 review of the 1st edition of Klostermaier's Survey of Hinduism (the book is now in its 3rd edition), Joel Brereton states that the book's \\"methodological eclecticism and emphasis on indigenous interpretation are reasonable strategies\\", but Klostermaier in his attempt to bring forward \\"Hindu voices to explain Hinduism, occasionally offers views that have little currency in modern scholarship\\". Brereton adds, \\"the book has a number of unique virtues, includes recent developments in Hinduism, and shows an intimacy with Hindus and the present realties of Hindu life. Best of all, it is grounded in the practice and sights of Hinduism, not just on the great ideas of literary Hinduism\\" Like Brereton, Knut Jacobsen states that Klostermaier's discussion of the Vedic era is weak and questionable. For instance, Klostermaier considers the Indus Valley Civilization as Vedic-Indian, which pushes back the Vedic period by several thousand years beyond the accepted chronology. Jacobsen adds that Klostermaeir's 2nd edition includes examples of Jain and Buddhist influences on Hinduism and the South Asian history, is especially valuable to students and it is \\"the most thorough introduction to Hinduism as a living religion in English\\".P Pratap Kumar (2010), Introducing Hinduism: The Master Narrative ‚Äî A Critical Review of Textbooks on Hinduism, Religious Studies Review, Volume 36, Issue 2, pages 115‚Äì124 Harold Coward describes the 2nd edition of A Survey of Hinduism as \\"This book offers the most comprehensive, balanced, accessible and yet deeply scholarly presentation of Hinduism in English,\\" and that, \\"Thomas Hopkins's, The Hindu Religious Tradition, the standard work when it was published some twenty-five years ago, looks rather primitive when compared with Klaus Klostermaier's A Survey of Hinduism, already in second edition by 1994\\".Howard Coward (1996), Book Review: \\"Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices\\", Journal of Hindu- Christian Studies, Volume 9, pages 46-47 George M. Williams has described Klostermaier's Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism as an \\"excellent resource by top scholar featuring concise entries.\\" According to Patricia Greer, Klostermaier's encyclopedic articles are useful, but finds Klostermaier's chronology in need of an explanation and one that leaves unresolved \\"the complexities of an issue that so vexes the field\\". Michael Witzel has called him a \\"recent convert to a Frawleyan view of the world\\". Noting that David Frawley pictures India as the unique cradle of civilization at 10,000 BCE, Witzel expressed dismay that Kostermaier had written an appreciative introduction to one of Frawley books, and included some of Frawleyan views in his own Survey of Hinduism. Such inclusion of unscientific views in college textbooks would have a \\"detrimental effect\\", states Witzel.

He was also an entrepreneur in the city of Ploie»ôti. Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea was the father of communist activist Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea and of philosopher Ionel Gherea. Biography Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea was born in Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire to Ukrainian Jewish Katz family. After studies at Kharkiv University (where he engaged in revolutionary politics), Dobrogeanu-Gherea fled persecution by the Okhrana and settled in Ia»ôi (1875). He was active in socialist politics, giving shape to the first centers of activism in Romania, and contributed to left-wing magazines such as Contemporanul. The group centered on Dobrogeanu-Gherea became the most preeminent one to form the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party. While the idea did exist before Dobrogeanu-Gherea, he strengthened Narodist thought within Romania, which was to have a crucial contribution to the emergence of Poporanism (although his group and the Poporanists became political adversaries after the latter joined the National Liberal Party and began using anti-Semitic slogans). Literary criticism From left to right: Christian Rakovsky, Leon Trotsky, and Dobrogeanu-Gherea, during a meeting in Bucharest (1913 drawing) Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea amended the aesthetical guidelines of Junimea and its most important voice, Titu Maiorescu. To the Junimea vision of art for art's sake, created through the merger of moment and authentic feeling, he added conditioning through social necessities (art with tendency). Maiorescu had been a critic of forms without substance (i. e.: cultural institutions that did not blend into, nor borrow from, society), but he had shown himself skeptical to the notion that art could ever be directed to serve a political purpose (especially if that purpose was socialism, which he rejected as a viable option). He wrote extensive studies on literary figures, and engaged in vivid polemics with many of his contemporaries. Dobrogeanu- Gherea had a lifelong friendship with Ion Luca Caragiale, giving an interpretation of his works through parallels established with writers of his generation in other cultures. For example, he compared Caragiale's short story An Easter Torch, a reflection on the brutal outcome of anti-Semitism, with writings by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The two exchanged letters for a large part of their lives: while never a socialist, Caragiale admired Dobrogenu-Gherea's attitudes and used his critique of Romanian society in the writing of his work 1907. From Spring to Autumn (expressing his beliefs about the causes and outcome of the 1907 peasants' revolt). Sociology Alongside small-scale works on dialectical materialism, Dobrogeanu-Gherea published his most debated volume, the 1910 NeoiobƒÉgia (Studiu economico-sociologic al problemei noastre agrare) [\\"Neo-Serfdom (A Social and Economical Study of Our Land Issue)\\"]. The work argued that Romania was trapped in feudalism, with the minimum of capitalist vehicles present only to ensure an easier exploitation of the peasantry by the social √©lite. According to Dobrogenu-Gherea, the land reform carried out under Alexandru Ioan Cuza (in 1864) had only procrastinated a dramatic outcome. In 1915, Leon Trotsky, citing Dobrogeanu-Gherea alongside Christian Rakovsky as a major figure of socialism in Romania, commented on Neo-Serfdom's conclusions: :\\"All the contradictions of the social and political life of : the bondage of the peasants, judicially repealed but resurrected by the logic of economic relations; the parliamentary regime set up on the basis of Asiatic agrarianism; \\"British\\" freedoms in the cities, the old style Turkish despotism in the countryside -all these phenomena are subjected in Gherea‚Äôs great book to a truly masterly analysis where clarity and simplicity go hand in hand with a genuine Marxist profundity.\\" Legacy Dobrogeanu-Gherea's works were adopted by the Romanian Communist Party. However, few of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's writings could be said to advocate political revolution, and all of them fit in the patterns of reformism. In 1948, he was posthumously made a member of the Romanian Academy.

Located near the summit of Santiam Pass on U.S. Route 20, the ski area operates on federal land through agreement with Willamette National Forest on Hoodoo Butte, a volcanic cinder cone. Hoodoo's slopes primarily face northeast. History The ski area was built in 1938, by a group funded by Ed Thurston of Bend. The group wanted to build on Three Fingered Jack but could not secure funding for a road. Following World War II, the ski area embarked on improvements, including lodging and chairlifts. Its three-story main lodge at the base was built in the late 1940s from World War II surplus structures and included sleeping quarters for 100 guests. It was threatened by a forest fire in the summer of 1967, but was spared by the use of back fires. An antiquated chairlift, with wooden towers, was destroyed. Less than a year later and unoccupied at the time except for a family dog, the lodge was destroyed by fire in April 1968. A new two-story day lodge was constructed later in the year, and the use of pickup campers became popular at the Hoodoo parking lot. In the 1960s, the ski area was purchased by Hoodoo Ski Bowl Developers, Inc., which later built the Manzanita chair lift. In the fall of 1985, the ski area took over the management of historic Santiam Lodge, which was built in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Formerly operated by the United Presbyterian Church, it provided dormitory-style lodging for up to 80 guests. In 1999, Hoodoo Ski Area was acquired by real estate developer and Umbrella Properties owner Chuck Shepard of Since then, Hoodoo has built the Hodag chair lift, a 60,000 sq. ft. lodge, the Autobahn Tubing Park, and replaced the green and red double chair lifts with quad chair lifts. Skiing Hoodoo has a full service lodge. Hoodoo's flagship Green lift‚Äîa fixed grip quad chair‚Äîservices the entire hill providing access to all and of vertical. Green is a 2001 replacement for the old double chair. The Ed chair, named after Hoodoo's founder, Ed Thurston, replaced the aging Red lift in 2001. The Manzanita triple chair serves the bowl, terrain park, and is open for night skiing. The Hodag lift was built in 1999 and services the backside terrain. The beginner area consists of a double chair (named Easy Rider) and is isolated from other terrain. Hoodoo also has a large selection of Nordic Skiing trails, both at high and lower altitudes. The tube hill, called the Autobahn Tubing Park, is on the northwest flanks of Hayrick Butte. The long runs are serviced by a handle tow. Hayrick Butte has a handle tow servicing the long tube lanes.

Jaipongan In 1961, Indonesian President Sukarno prohibited rock and roll and other western genres of music, and challenged Indonesian musicians to revive the indigenous arts. Gugum Gumbira took up the challenge, and studied rural dance and festival music for twelve years. Jaipongan, or Jaipong, was the most popular result of his study, derived from the updating of a village ritual music called ketuk tilu, with moves from Pencak Silat, the Indonesian martial art, and music from the masked theater dance, Topeng Banjet, and the Wayang Golek puppet theater. In the original ketuk tilu, the group typically consists of the ketuk tilu pot-gong, other small gongs, a rebab (spike fiddle), barrel drums, and a female singer-dancer (ronggeng) who is often also a prostitute, who invites men to dance with her sensually. Gugum expanded the drum section as part of an urban gamelan orchestra, sped up the music, redefined the singer as just a singer (Pesindh√®n), and came up with the catchy onomatopoeic name. Many listeners consider the music very complex, with the dynamic rhythm liable to change seemingly randomly. Jaipongan debuted in 1974 when Pak Gugum and his gamelan and dancers first performed in public. Sporadic government attempts to suppress it due to its perceived immorality (it inherited some of the sensuality of ketuk tilu) just made it more popular. It survived even after the official Indonesian ban on foreign pop music was lifted after a few years, and became a craze in the 1980s. Since the mid-1980s Jaipongan's importance as a social dance has waned, but it remained popular as a stage dance, performed by women, mixed couples or as a solo. The most widely available album of Jaipongan outside Indonesia is Tonggeret by Idjah Hadidjah and Gugum Gumbira's Jugala orchestra, released in 1987, and re-released as West Java: Sundanese Jaipong and other Popular Music by Nonesuch/Elektra Records.. Jugala Gugum Gumbira's Jugala Studios in Bandung served as the base for his own Jugala orchestra and dance troupe, and hosted and recorded many other musicians, including Sabah Habas Mustapha, and The Residents. The Jugala orchestra includes Sundanese gamelan instruments, drums, rebab and suling flute, and plays Jaipongan and contemporary degung music.

The dance was created by Gugum Gumbira, based on traditional Sundanese Ketuk Tilu music and Pencak Silat movements.  Background  In 1961, Indonesian President Sukarno prohibited rock and roll and other western genres of music, and challenged Indonesian musicians to revive the indigenous arts. The name jaipongan came from people mimicking of the sounds created by some of the drums in the ensemble. Audiences were often heard shouting jaipong after specific sections of rhythmic music were played. Jaipongan debuted in 1974 when Gugum Gumbira and his gamelan and dancers first performed in public. The most widely available album of Jaipongan outside of Indonesia is Tonggeret by singer Idjah Hadidjah and Gugum Gumbira's Jugala orchestra, released in 1987, and re-released as West Java: Sundanese Jaipong and other Popular Music by Nonesuch/Elektra Records.  Gugum Gumbira  Gugum Gumbira is a Sundanese composer, orchestra leader, choreographer, and entrepreneur from Bandung, Indonesia. After 1961, when the Indonesian President Sukarno banned all forms of western music and challenged his people to revive their cultural music, Gugum Gumbira made this task his own. In order to do this he studied the rural, festival dance music for twelve years. His result was jaipongan. He created his own recording studio in Indonesia called Jugala. Gugum Gumbira was born in 1945 in Bandung, Indonesia. He attended college in Bandung where he majored in social and political UNPAD. Once he left college, he took up a position at the Ministry of Finance and later moved to Government Vehicles. He also lectured at the Academy of Finance until 1988. He currently owns a recording studio called Jugala where he conducts his orchestra also called Jugala and a dance troupe that shares the same name. They travel around the world to perform. As the choreographer for Jugala, he met his wife, Euis Komariah, who was the singer for the orchestra and a dancer in the troupe.  Musical origins  OJaipongan dance performance accompanied by Sundanese degung mixed with modern instruments. Jaipongan, also known as jaipong, is a musical performance genre of the Sundanese people in the Sundanese language of West Java, Indonesia. Jaipongan includes revived indigenous arts, like gamelan, but it also did not ignore Western music completely despite the ban on rock and roll. It used its sensuality and the sensuality found in a traditional village music and dance, ketuk tilu. However, many believe it is something purely Indonesian or Sundanese in origin and style. It is developed predominately from rural folk forms and traditions as a purely indigenous form. The rise of cassettes and films has led to the popularity of the musical form of jaipongan. It has spread from its home in West Java's Sunda, to greater Java and Indonesia. It can be seen as many regional varieties of gong-chime performance found through much of Indonesia. As also an urban dance form, it is based primarily on the village forms of ketuk tilu and on the Indonesian martial arts, pencak silat. The musical genre is largely influenced from ketuk tilu with traces of the masked theater dance, topeng banjet and the wayang golek puppet theater. Ketuk tilu is its biggest influence, as a traditional Sudanese musical entertainment form. Gong-chime performance is characterized by such features as: use of an ensemble dominated by idiophones, metallophones and knobbed gongs. It is a stratified polyphony, with lower-pitch instruments playing parts of lesser density and all parts are structured colotomically around time-cycles. This can be found in traditional Indonesian gamelan. There is improvisation on certain instruments. The modes used are grouped into two broad types: slendro and pelog. Ketuk tilu was a musical genre based on ritual and celebration in the villages of the Sundanese people, meaning three kettle gongs. It was known for complex drumming coordinated with equally dynamic solo female dancers. The music was performed for planting and harvesting rituals and later celebrated village life, circumcision and marriage, expressed fertility, and displayed sensuality, eroticism and even sometimes ‚Äúsocially accepted prostitution.‚Äù Ketuk tilu was very popular in the Sundanese villages, but the urban Sundanese considered it unrefined and inappropriate because the music involved males and females dancing together suggestively, or mixed dancing between men and ronggeng, or prostitutes. Ronggeng probably has existed in Java since ancient time, the bas reliefs in Karmawibhanga section on Borobudur displays the scene of travelling entertainment troupe with musicians and female dancers. The cassette industry and its boom in Indonesia helped popularize jaipongan greatly and promoted regional styles rather than hurt them. Many learned the dance through cassette rather than the performance. The mass media have made jaipong ubiquitous. It has created competition in the styles of the drummers among ensembles. It has also helped to bring about many dance schools, altering dance and its label on females in West Java. The song repertoire of jaipongan is varied, and that is why it is better understood as an intertwined performance style of music and dance. Many songs are associated with ketuk tilu or other wide reaching regional varieties, not traditional gamelan. It consists of songs of more recent origin often composed for jaipongan. Song topics vary, encompassing amatory, moralistic, bawdy, topical and spiritual subjects, often emphasizing grass roots culture.  Instrumentation & choreography  Jaipongan is \\"a more slick and expanded version of ketuk tilu\\". Jaipongan takes much of its instrumentation from ketuk tilu ensembles. The ketuk tilu group is composed of pot-gongs. Besides the core three main kettle gongs (ketuk means to knock (or knocking sound), but in this case refers to the three gongs; while tilu means three), the instruments include a rebab, a small upright bowed instrument, also known as a spike fiddle, other small gongs ‚Äî a hanging gong and two iron plates, and two or three barrel drums. The traditional singer is female or a sinden, but also dances and invites men to dance with her sensually, so it is assumed she is a prostitute or ronggeng. The ensemble is small enough to be carried from village to village to places where a saron or kempul may be added. Gumbira took and retrofitted the dynamic and intense ketuk-tilu music. The role of the singer was emphasized to concentrate just on the vocals. He added to it traditional gamelan by expanding the drum section of the ketuk tilu as more of an urban, unique gamelan orchestra from two drums to six. He also sped up the music significantly, increasing the dance role. He also modified the accompanying dance. The modifications retained some of the original sensual moves of ketuk tilu, joining to them a popular martial art called pencak silat. Gumbira called it jaipong. Jaipongan cassettes really feature the singer with their name and alluring cover photos. The singer is given greatest prominence, no longer seen as a prostitute but professional and respectful. This goes with the market demand for solo-superstars. The idiophonic accompaniment of jaipongan may also include a few saron or a gegung (an L-shaped row of gong chimes), and often a gambang (xylophone). Otherwise instruments are the same as in ketuk tilu, plus a drum kit, electric guitars and keyboards. The melodies are set to madenda, the Sundanese variant of the pelog mode, or slendro, or a free combination of the two, or an alternating combination. The melodies are usually in the pelog or madenda scales, while the fixed pitch idiophonic accompaniment is strictly in slendro. This combination contrasts with the gamelan tradition. The scales of these modes, intonation and tonic are difficult and not consistent. Intonation may be further obscured by the characteristic vibrato. These melodies in jaipongan can also be stereotypical; so much of the expressiveness and uniqueness comes in the introduction, improvised or pre-composed. It often establishes the modal pattern. The verses are often organized into quatrains, each is one gong cycle, and in rhyme scheme aabbcc, each line having about eight syllables, as in most Sundanese folk and popular verse.  Social implications  In 1961, the president of Indonesia, President Sukarno created a ban on western music, mainly the genre of rock and roll, due to the fact that western ideas, themes, values and morals began to infiltrate the area. With the ban, Sukarno urged the public to ‚Äúreturn to and revive the musical traditions of the past‚Äù. Gugum Gumbira heard this and decided to create a genre of music that would revive the musical interests of the past and added sexual undertones and a sense of elegance in order to bring it into the future. In addition to being a musical reincarnation, jaipongan also reincarnated martial arts and traditional dance. It became so popular that the government decided that it needed to be taught to people of all generations. When jaipongan was first introduced in 1974, there was a lack of acceptable music in the area of West Java‚ÄîSunda more specifically. It gained popularity instantly because it was a completely non- western form of music that the government accepted and promoted. It had all of the values of traditional Sundanese music to entice the older generations, yet had enough energy, vibrancy, and sexuality to entice the younger generations. Jaipongan was also based on the life of the lower class and elevated their stories and struggles. It allowed the people to see themselves in the music and feel as if they were a part of their culture. Once it became popular, many other musicians began recreating it. When situations in Sunda became more political, the music shifted and took on themes of moral, political, social, spiritual awareness. Once the shift occurred, the government tried its best to end jaipongan. Due to its popularity with the people, it was able to maintain its craze, and even outlasted the ban on Western Music. The sexual nature of the songs was taken from the idea of prostitution, and was then elevated in order to make it a more elegant, civilized part of art. This broke gender barriers because it changed the way in which men and women interacted. Never before had men and women danced or interacted together in promiscuous or sexually explicit or suggestive ways in performance in Indonesia. Even though jaipongan was created to stay away from musical themes of sex, love, drugs, and rock and roll, it incorporated some of these themes in small increments. When the government discovered the sexual nature of the songs and dances, they looked to curb the popularity of jaipongan, but it had already become the music of the people and their efforts were thwarted. Jaipongan was a way for the Sundanese people to take back their culture from the Western ideas and rid themselves of the colonial Dutch influences. Jaipongan elevated the idea of village music or music of the people. It focused on love, money, agriculture, and as the world became filled with more turmoil, it became a vehicle for moral, political spiritual, and social awareness. Jaipongan became so popular that in 1976, two years after its creation, it was recorded on cassettes on Gumbira's record label Jugala. With the cassette's release international popularity rose and helped to create a larger musical industry in Sunda and Indonesia at large. All of which was and still is used to help preserve the culture and history of the West Java and the Sundanese people. The rapid popularity of Jaipongan along with the boom in cassette tapes helped the genre to spread and become popular in Asia, Europe, and America during the 1980s. In addition it created a tourism industry in Sunda. People from all over the world came to learn about and experience Jaipongan first hand. Music and dance schools were created in order to preserve the art form and history of the Sundanese people. The government felt that Jaipongan was such a cultural staple that it needed to be taught to all citizens.  Jaipong today  Jaipongan In 2011, the international popularity of jaipongan has decreased, but in Asia, the genre still extremely popular. It is most popular in the areas of Sunda, where it was created, as well as the surrounding villages and cities. Although the genre is most popular in Asia, there are jaipongan dance troupes and musical ensembles in Europe in addition to the United States (like Harsanari of San Francisco, California) and throughout other parts of the world. Dutch-Indonesian choreographer Gerard Mosterd devised a modern dance choreography, \\"Ketuk Tilu\\" in 1998. Approved and inspired by Gugum Gumbira. Based on a classic recording with Euis Komariah and Jugala Orchestra. In 2015, jaipongan was noted as a modern classical genre of music, which is often utilized in other Asian music, and has multiple subgenres. There is still is a large market for jaipongan recordings. However, few years ago fundamentalist political proposals were submitted to blacklist jaipongan and several other 'sensual\\" Indonesian dance forms.The ban attempt didn't succeed and jaipongan remains a very popular underground genre associated with erotic and rebellious power instead.  Film  The mass media has helped jaipongan become popular especially in the cinema but not as much as cassettes. There are many filmed performances online from students/audiences and dance documentaries from Java/Indonesia. Jaipongan songs have been taken and set to Mr. Bean, a character created by Rowan Atkinson, and other modern popular cultural references in YouTube videos. Music videos and performances of Tonggeret by Idijah Hadijah as well as other famous artists can be seen on YouTube and also can be heard and referenced in use by Indian film songs. There is a full- length film called Mistri Ronggeng Jaipong from Indonesia, which was made in 1982 by Mardali Syareif. There is also a Jean Hellwig film on popular dancing in West Java, from 1989, with accompanying book and jaipongan chapter called Sundanese Pop Culture Alive.

Owned by Urban One, \\"Majic 102\\" has an urban adult contemporary radio format. KMJQ is co-owned with 97.9 KBXX and 92.1 KROI, with studios and offices located in the Greenway Plaza district. KMJQ is one of the high-ranking stations in Greater Houston, sometimes reaching number-one. It is also one of the most honored UAC stations in the U.S, according to radio trade publications. KMJQ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non- grandfathered FM stations in the U.S. The transmitter is on Blueridge Trail in Southwest Houston.Radio-Locator.com/KMJQ KMJQ broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries an urban gospel format, known as \\"Praise Houston.\\" History =KAJC-FM= In 1961, the station originally signed on the air as KAJC-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-173 The station's original city of license was Alvin, Texas, and it was powered at only 3,200 watts, a fraction of its output today. The studios and transmitter were also located in Alvin. At a time when FM typically aired beautiful music or classical music, it was the first FM station in the Houston area to broadcast adult contemporary music and hourly news. In 1962 and 1963 it became the first FM station in Texas to win major news awards from the UPI Texas Broadcasters' Association, including story of the year and best news coverage in population class. =KMSC= In 1964, the station was sold, changing its call sign to KMSC. The city of license was moved to Clear Lake City on Galveston Bay. The power was increased to 100,000 watts, greatly expanding the station's coverage of Greater Houston.Broadcasting Yearbook 1978 page C-209 Styled as the \\"Voice of the Manned Spacecraft Center\\", KMSC broadcast news about the space program and easy listening music. Later, the station call letters changed to KLYX or \\"Clicks,\\" while continuing to play easy listening music. =All-News KLYX= In 1975, it became a network affiliate of new NBC News and Information Service (NIS). NBC provided 24 hours a day of all-news radio programming, with some local news inserts from KLYX. NIS aired on 102.1 from 1975 to the end of the service in early 1977. KLYX's local news inserts originated from new studios in Houston. The station was permitted to bypass one of the FCC rules, known as the \\"Arizona Waiver.\\" It was named after a Glendale, Arizona station, owned by the Arizona Broadcasting Corporation. Back when the main studio of a station had to be inside the city of license, the Arizona Waiver gave stations an out. It allowed a station to air its recorded, non-network shows from an 'auxiliary' studio (in this case Houston) while its live local public affairs shows would air from a city of license studio. This worked well with the easy listening format, as 94% of the station was recorded music and commercials. The 6% news and non entertainment items could originate from the main studio. This was expanded to let the station broadcast its local and non network shows from the Clear Lake studios. In 1979, the community of Clear Lake City, Texas, was annexed by Houston. That meant Houston became KLYX's city of license. In 1982, the transmitter was moved from downtown Houston (Shell Plaza tower farm, where it had been since 1973) to the new shared tower at Missouri City. =KMJQ= The station was relaunched in 1977 as KMJQ, and became Houston's first FM CHR/UC hybrid formatted station (also known as \\"CHUrban\\", which would later become the rhythmic contemporary format). KMJQ's slogan became \\"The New Majic 102 FM, where the music is the Majic!\\" And it went on to obtain high listenership among African American audiences, as well as a diverse audience. KMJQ was sold by Keymarket Media to the San Diego-based Noble Media in 1988. It became co-owned with KYOK months later, which transitioned from an R&B;/soul music station to a hip hop music format as \\"The New YO! 1590 Raps!\\" in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, KMJQ changed its branding to \\"Majic 102 Jams!\\" or just simply \\"102 Jams!\\". Some Reggae was played in rotation during the transition, along with R&B;, soul, urban gospel, new jack swing, jazz, funk music and hip-hop. It got some competition from 98.5 KHYS (now KTJM) in the mid-1980s. But in 1991, KMJQ gained fierce competition from 97.9 KBXX (the former KFMK) upon that station's launch. KBXX, then a rhythmic contemporary station (mixing in hip hop, R&B; and some dance pop titles), quickly emerged as KMJQ's prime competitor for their mutual targeted audience demographic. The battle over the coveted 18-34 \\"urban\\" listening audience continued for three years, affecting KMJQ's dominanc, as it fell behind KBXX and dropped in the ratings. =Ownership Changes= The rivalry between KMJQ and KBXX ended in 1994, when KBXX was sold to Clear Channel Communications and a short time later bought KMJQ in 1995 from Noble Media, separating it from longtime partner 1590 KYOK. That year, KMJQ modified its format to Urban Adult Contemporary and returned the \\"Majic 102 FM\\" brand to the station. From then on, the station focused more on R&B;, classic soul and Quiet Storm music only, while co-owned KBXX focused on younger listeners. In 2000, when Clear Channel bought out several other radio corporations (as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996), KMJQ and KBXX were spun off to the Washington, D.C.-based, black-owned Radio One. (Radio One changed its name to Urban One in 2018.) Also in 2000, KMJQ became the Houston affiliate of the nationally syndicated \\"Tom Joyner Morning Show\\". In 2003, the station rebranded as \\"Majic 102.1, Houston's R&B; Leader\\" to avoid frequency confusion with Beaumont, Texas Urban radio station KTCX \\"Magic 102.5\\", although longtime listeners still refer to the station as \\"Majic 102\\" based on heritage. For a brief period in 2008, the station carried Mo'Nique in the Afternoon through Radio One's syndicated division. In 2011, when KROI dropped its five-year urban gospel format for an all-news radio format, KMJQ added a digital subchannel to carry that previous format now known as \\"Praise Houston.\\" In popular culture \\"Majic 102 Jams!\\" was featured throughout the 1994 film Jason's Lyric.

Plot The first part of the movie takes place in Bangkok, Thailand. Ko Fei's (Chow Yun-fat) friend Sam Sei (Anthony Wong) borrows money from a loan shark to give Ko Fei's departed mother a proper burial. The loan shark kidnaps Sam, and Ko Fei rescues him by confronting the loan shark and persuading him to give more time for Sam to re-pay the loan. The loan shark does not comply and orders his cohorts to kill Sam, but Ko Fei punches two of them before he engages a knife fight with the remaining gang members. After doing so, the loan shark attempts to shoot Ko Fei, but he wrestles the gun out of the shark's grasp, frees a trapped Sam Sei and escapes. Not wanting to lose face, the loan shark promises to kill them, so Ko Fei and Sam Sei flee the city. To earn money, they team up with Sam's cousin Judge (Simon Yam) for a heist. The group meets up, although a fight between Ko Fei's and Judge's friend (Chung and Psycho respectively) breaks out, which is triggered by Ko Fei making remarks about Lau Ngang. After the initial group meeting, Judge, meanwhile, is offered money from the loan shark to kill Ko Fei and Sam during the heist. The heist begins with Ko Fei blocking traffic while Lau Ngang tosses a grenade into an irate driver's car, which explodes. The intended target is a lorry and the group shoots and kills the passengers. Psycho gets in the truck but kicks Chung out and prevents him from boarding. The heist is successful, but Judge betrays Ko Fei by attempting to kill him, only to kill Chung instead. A car chase ensues between the two. The scene ends when Ko Fei flips his car up-side down. Judge examines the wreckage only to be ambushed by Ko Fei. Another fight ensues, Judge slices Ko Fei's right finger and thumb but is interrupted by a resident who shoots in the air telling them to leave. The stolen truck, now occupied by Lau Ngang and Psycho, shoot at the house, killing everyone but a girl. Ko Fei takes shelter, but Sam Sei appears with a gun intending to kill Ko Fei (at the behest of Judge), but shoots him once in the chest and the rest at the floor. Sam Sei walks out with a pair of bloody eyes to prove that he has \\"killed\\" Ko Fei (Judge made remarks about Ko Fei's \\"mesmerising eyes\\" earlier). Convinced, he shoots the pressure cooker, causing it to explode, burning alive the previously shot resident and the girl, leaving her with 3rd degree burns. Ko Fei, assumed to be dead, returns to the city, finding Sam now a competent gangster. Seemingly seeking revenge, he steals the shipment of guns Judge was hoping to sell and ransoms them back. The money is for the hospital stricken girl burned in the fire fight. The pair meet again, but not before Ko Fei guns down all of Judge's cohorts including Psycho. Judge gives Ko Fei the money and asks for the goods, but Ko Fei simply detonates the goods in the end, much to Judge's chagrin. The two shoot at each other, but it's Ko Fei who gains the upper hand when he throws his butterfly knife at Judge. Ko Fei finally kills Judge before quipping \\"Go masturbate in hell!\\" Cast * Chow Yun-fat as Ko Fei * Simon Yam as Judge * Anthony Wong as Sam Sei * Ann Bridgewater as Mona * Bonnie Fu as Lau Ngang * Frankie Chan as Deano * Nam Yin as Loanshark Hung * Victor Hon Kwan as Kau * Chris Lee as Chung * Chun Hung as Julianne Style In an interview with the Hong Kong Film Archive, Lam described the difference between his more political films and Full Contact, stating that he did not want to create a film \\"that had anything to do with the sociological or political issues and situations of the time. I wanted to wash my hands of them and start with a clean slate. People had threatened to chop me up, accused me of having wrong political views and I didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with those things. I wanted to make a film with a style no one could put a finger on.\\" Release Full Contact was released in Hong Kong on 23 July 1992. It grossed a total of HK$16,793,011. Reception Variety referred to the film as \\"Fast, fierce and gleefully tasteless\\" while noting that it lacked the \\"transcendent style\\" of the John Woo films starring Chow Yun-fat. The Austin Chronicle referred to the story of the film as the \\"more or less the same old thing\\" while stating that \\"Despite the obvious comparisons to Woo's films, Full Contact survives on its own gritty merits. It's a down-and-dirty little actioneer that leaves you squirming, breathless in your seat.\\" In Time Out, it was described as \\"Super-slick, making opportune use of Bangkok locations, and relishing every violent episode, the film's unquestionably good of its type, but also sleazy and soulless.\\" Film 4 gave a negative review of the film, opining it was a \\"dated and discomforting B-movie\\" noting weakness in the characterization and plot. Sight & Sound stated in 1998 that the film was \\"Lam's most generic work\\" describing the first half of the film as like watching a Theatre of Cruelty. The review went on to state that the second half of the film differs: \\"When Chow's gunslinger returns home to find his wife living with his best friend, the film becomes a perceptive and tough-minded dissection of a romantic triangle. The shifting alliances and emotional stalemates are played out with sympathy and subtlety, suggesting a personal motivation behind the film's making.\\" In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.

The Centre is governed by a board composed of nine members: three from Denmark, three from Germany, one representative from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, one from the Council of Europe and one from the European Union. The institute's first director was Stefan Troebst, now Professor of East European Cultural Studies at the University of Leipzig. His successor Professor Marc Weller led the Centre from 1999 until 2009. Today, he holds the Chair of International Law and International Constitutional Studies at the University of Cambridge.https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/Staff_and_Students/professor-marc-weller Professor Tove Malloy managed the institution from 2009 until 2019. In 2019, the Executive Board of the European Centre for Minority Issues has named Professor Vello Pettai, as the new Director of the ECMI. Professor Pettai will take up his new position as ECMI Director on 1 March 2020. The Centre employs a core staff and also hosts visiting fellows and visiting research associates. The Centre organizes its activities around three principal themes. It is concerned with the evaluation and further development of universal, regional, bilateral and national standards that may assist in consolidating democratic governance on the basis of ethnic diversity and human rights. In this context, ECMI is also particularly interested in the emerging convergence of standards between EU members and applicant states. A second area of involvement relates to implementation procedures and mechanisms for these diverse standards and the study of their effectiveness. At times, ECMI has been invited to consider standards implementation and majority-minority relations in particular states in cooperation with the government of that state and local groups. Publications Over the years,the European Centre for Minority Issues has produced a number of Monographs, Reports, Working Papers and Issue Briefs,as well as the peer reviewed online open access journal, Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe (JEMIE), in addition to co-editorship (with EURAC Bozen) of the flagship publication European Yearbook of Minority Issues. The goal of this publication effort is to increase the awareness and dissemination of topics on minority issues, as well as to encourage further research in this field.

Traditional birth attendants provide the majority of primary maternity care in many developing countries, and may function within specific communities in developed countries. Traditional midwives provide basic health care, support and advice during and after pregnancy and childbirth, based primarily on experience and knowledge acquired informally through the traditions and practices of the communities where they originated.World Health Organization. 2010. Classifying health workers. Geneva, WHO. They usually work in rural, remote and other medically underserved areas. TBAs may not receive formal education and training in health care provision, and there are no specific professional requisites such as certification or licensure. A traditional birth attendant may have been formally educated and has chosen not to register.Occupational licensing of a credence good: the regulation of midwifery, accessed 3 March 2011. They often learn their trade through apprenticeship or are self-taught; in many communities one of the criteria for being accepted as a TBA by clients is experience as a mother. Many traditional midwives are also herbalists, or other traditional healers. They may or may not be integrated in the formal health care system. They sometimes serve as a bridge between the community and the formal health system, and may accompany women to health facilities for delivery. Training and focus of work Traditional birth attendants are often older women, respected in their communities. They consider themselves as private health care practitioners who respond to requests for service. The focus of their work is to assist women during delivery and immediately post-partum. Frequently their assistance includes helping with household chores.United Nations Population Fund. 1996. Evaluation Findings: Support to traditional birth attendants http://www.unfpa.org/monitoring/pdf/n-issue7.pdf TBAs may not have any formal training on how to attend pregnant women. Many are highly experienced in well woman care including how to recognize and respond appropriately to complications of pregnancy. It is a matter of discussion whether the lack of education in some TBAs and the way many attend deliveries are risky for the mothers and their babies.World Vision: Ethiopia: Trained traditional birth attendants easing delivery, accessed 3 March 2011. Evaluating the impact of these traditional practitioners on health outcomes requires taking into consideration additional factors such as poverty, availability of health services, or institutional support.World Health Organization. \\"General guidelines for methodologies on research and evaluation of traditional medicine.\\" (2000). It is being increasingly recognized that TBAs may have a role to play in improving health outcomes in developing countries because of their access to communities and the relationships they share with women in local communities, especially if women are unable to access skilled care.Maternal Health Task Force: Hamlin Fistula Hospital, MHTF blog, accessed 3 March 2011. Some countries, training institutes and non-governmental agencies are initiating efforts to train TBAs in basic and emergency obstetric care, family planning, and other maternal health topics, in order to enhance the links between modern health care services and the community, and to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies.World Health Organization: Addressing Emergency Obstetric Care and Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Central African Republic, accessed 3 March 2011.African Resources: Traditional Birth Attendants, accessed 3 March 2011. There is little evidence of large-scale effectiveness of targeted intervention programmes for training TBAs, as they are rarely integrated within a general strategy for improving maternal and child care. Integration into healthcare systems in developing countries Historically, Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) have operated outside of the formal healthcare delivery structure. TBA training has been used as a means of extending health services to underserved communities in developing nations in hopes of decreasing mortality and morbidity. While the focus in the past two decades has been on training TBAs, studies on training impact has shown conflicting results in maternal outcomes with many studies showing little to no impact on high maternal mortality outcomes. As a result, there has been a shift toward skilled birth attendants, capable of averting and managing complications. The TBA role in the community should not be overlooked; they are highly respected members and proven assets in addressing poor maternal outcomes.The Safe Motherhood Demonstration Project, Kenya ‚Äì Ministry of Health, University of Nairobi and Population Council: \\"Birth Attendants in Maternal Health Programs\\", accessed 30 January 2012, TBAs have been unsuccessful in handling obstetric complications, but have contributed to successful maternal, neonatal, and child health interventions, although there is insufficient evidence that TBA training improves peri-neonatal mortality. The key piece missing in TBA training is an adequate referral system, which allows TBAs to use their close ties with the community to link pregnant women to skilled birth attendants (SBA). The effectiveness of TBA referrals to health facilities is dependent on the healthcare system‚Äôs ability to support an increase in services provided and the supervision needed to support TBA integration. ‚ÄúFive mechanisms for TBA integration were identified: training and supervision of TBAs; collaboration skills for health workers; inclusion of TBAs in facility-based activities; systems for communication between TBAs and SBAs; and defining roles for TBAs and SBAs.‚Äù While these mechanisms are important, complementary activities also influenced TBA referral and integration success: ‚Äúcareful selection of TBAs; community participation; health system development; and affordability changes.‚Äù TBA‚Äôs must be provided with appropriate knowledge, easy access to health personnel, and quality and regular supervision; all three components enable training to become a tool for TBA integration into the healthcare system. The referral training for TBAs allows them to act as ‚Äúintermediaries between the community and the formal health care system.‚Äù Training that advocates collaboration and regular involvement in clinic duties, increases the number of referrals and improves communication. The World Health Organization‚Äôs Strategies and Interventions for Obstetric Referrals: * An adequately resourced referral facility. * Communications and feedback systems. * Designated transport. * Protocols for identifying complications that are specific to the setting. * Personnel trained in the use of these protocols * Teamwork between referral levels. * A unified records system. * Mechanisms to ensure that patients do not bypass levels Tools to improve communication and transportation to maternal health facilities ‚ÄúMost maternal deaths from direct causes (such as hemorrhage, obstructed labor, infections, eclampsia, or unsafe abortions) could be prevented if women received timely care at critical moments.‚Äù On average, half of deliveries in the developing world have a skilled birth attendant present. With many deliveries outside of the health center, and an estimated 9-15% of deliveries requiring intervention, access to transportation and communication are critical to improve maternal and infant outcomes. Major contributing factors to maternal death are: ‚Äúdelay in recognizing danger signs, deciding to seek care, reaching care, and receiving care at health facilities‚Äù. =Transportation programs= Malawi: Communities have employed bicycle ambulances and oxcarts to transport pregnant women to health facilities. There were issues during the rainy season. The program later added ambulances, targeted information, education, maternity waiting, and focused education activities for decision makers in the family. The maternity waiting homes were rare because they required funds collected by the community. Sierra Leone: The Ministry of Health used a radio system in conjunction with four-wheel-drive vehicles. This program has seen success. The program increased emergency referrals and the case fatality dropped. Uganda: * Stationing two ambulances at a referral facility was not effective. Communication and lack of planning for fuel price hikes and shortages were cited as the causes for poor results. * UNFPA used four-wheel-drive vehicles, a designated referral point and a standard for referral care. Reports of fuel shortages threaten the success of the program. Honduras: Improved roads, communication, ambulances, and increased staffing and equipment increased referrals and reduced maternal mortality. Sri Lanka: The Sri Lankan government provided three to five ambulances at each hospital. The program gave health workers the authority to organize, pay, and receive reimbursement for privately organized transportation. Nigeria: Community leaders negotiated a contract with a local bus union to transport women with obstetric emergencies. The drivers received training and were reimbursed for fuel by a community fund. In the event of a death police and local authorities were made aware of the arrangement, so that bus drivers would not be held liable. West Africa: Some countries in West Africa use a yellow flag as a signal to passing drivers that a laboring woman is in distress. Willing drivers stop and transport the woman to a health facility. =Communication programs= Uganda: UNFPA provides TBAs with solar-powered VHF-radio that connects directly to the health provider, walkie-talkies for TBAs, and ambulance services. UNFPA has reported success. UNFPA stresses the importance of both communication and transportation to improve service delivery of maternal health services. Sierra Leone: Health staff used a two-way radio to communicate with other facilities to improve referrals and alert staff of their arrival and situation. A solar powered system worked better than a battery charged system. Communication difficulties were experienced in mountainous regions. Health centers resolved this issue by communicating to closer centers, which then communicated the message to the desired destination.

Scott, Dana Wynter, Clive Brook, Gladys Cooper and Herbert Marshall. It is loosely based on a 1959 novel of the same name written by Philip MacDonald. Plot A writer named Adrian Messenger (John Merivale) believes a series of apparently unrelated \\"accidental\\" deaths are actually linked murders. He asks his friend Anthony Gethryn (George C. Scott), recently retired from MI5, to help clear up the mystery, and provides him with a list of the victims' names. Soon afterward, Messenger's plane is bombed while he is en route to collect evidence to confirm his suspicions and, with his dying breath, he tells a fellow passenger the key to the mystery. The passenger survives and turns out to be Raoul Le Borg (Jacques Roux), Gethryn's old World War II counterpart in the French Resistance. The two of them join forces to investigate Messenger's list of names and decode his cryptic final words. They are joined by Lady Jocelyn Bruttenholm (Dana Wynter), Messenger‚Äôs cousin and a former love interest of Gethryn, who Raoul is strongly attracted to. The first conclusion Gethryn and Le Borg draw from Messenger‚Äôs words is that there is important information in the manuscript of his unpublished book. Unfortunately, the murderer has beaten them there; he has taken several pages and re-typed them, removing certain information, and murdered the typist to conceal the error (encountering Jocelyn on his way out). After inspecting the manuscript, Gethryn spots the error, but he is powerless to undo it, and arrives too late to save the typist. From Jocelyn‚Äôs brief encounter with the murderer, Gethryn determines that he wears realistic masks to disguise his appearance. Next, Gethryn and Le Borg visit the only living name on the list, James Slattery. When they arrive, they are told by James' invalid twin brother, Joe Slattery, that James died of a heart attack several years earlier. The two of them leave in disappointment, assuming all names on the list have died. That night, however, Joe sees and recognizes the masked murderer and pursues him, but the murderer knocks him out and pushes him into the ocean with his wheelchair, drowning him. The following day, his mother reveals the truth to Gethryn; ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù was actually James, who impersonated his deceased brother to collect his disability pension. From James' mother, and from the widow of another name of the list, Gethryn and Le Borg establish that all on the list were together in a prisoner of war camp in Burma, where a Canadian sergeant betrayed his fellow prisoners, foiling their escape attempt. It stands to reason that the Canadian is the murderer, and killed each of the names on the list to prevent them from identifying him. They deduce that he is about to come into prominence and cannot risk being recognized. Almost by accident, Messenger‚Äôs final clue falls into place; it is revealed that the Canadian stands in line to an inheritance of the Bruttenholms, Jocelyn‚Äôs family of landed gentry, who avidly engage in fox hunting. Having disposed of all possible witnesses to his wartime treachery, the Canadian, George Brougham (pronounced 'Broom') (Kirk Douglas), appears at a Bruttenholm estate fox hunt and introduces himself as a member of the family (he has previously been seen only in disguise). It then becomes clear to the visiting Gethryn and Le Borg that Brougham's next victim is to be the young heir, Derek, who comes before Brougham in inheritance. In an attempt to divert Brougham, Gethryn informs him of his investigation of Messenger‚Äôs list, calculating to set himself up as the next victim. That night, Brougham sabotages the next morning‚Äôs hunt by laying a drag with a fox in a sack over the fields. He especially marks a blind spot behind a high wall, and moves a large hay tedder behind, intending for Gethryn (who has been given the honor of leading the hunt) to be impaled upon its lethal tines. Unbeknownst to Brougham, his plan goes awry when a farmer repositions the tedder early the next morning. The hunt begins, but comes to a halt at the specified spot. Gethryn reveals to the gathered crowd that he discovered and removed the hay- tedder booby trap earlier that morning and, with the help of the lead fox hound, will detect the scent of the culprit amongst a group of hunt saboteurs. Brougham, once again disguised, is identified and runs off, mounting Derek's horse. When Derek shouts a command to the horse, the animal stops short, throwing Brougham and impaling him on the very same machine he intended for Gethryn. Cast * George C.

Commentary The List of Adrian Messenger is a relatively modern Golden Age type of mystery with an additional gimmick that was featured prominently in its advertising. A number of famous Hollywood actors were advertised to appear in the film heavily disguised in make-up designed by John Chambers: Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, and Robert Mitchum. During an epilogue the stars appear on-camera removing their disguises and revealing their identity. Curtis is revealed to have portrayed a street organ player; Lancaster removes the disguise of a female fox-hunt protester; Sinatra doffs the make-up of a gypsy horse-trader; Mitchum removes his disguise as the victim Slattery; and Douglas sheds one of his make-ups at the close of a montage of several of the killer‚Äôs personas. In actuality, only Curtis, Mitchum and Douglas performed in the body of the film. Lancaster and Sinatra only appear during the unmasking coda; their parts were portrayed by uncredited performers. Similarly, several of Douglas‚Äô character‚Äôs disguised personas were performed instead by character actor Jan Merlin, who was hired in secret and labored with the Universal make-up artists for nearly a year before shooting began, under sometimes painful conditions and with no attribution. Merlin later incorporated his experiences working on this production into a thriller novel, Shooting Montezuma ().Weaver, Tom. Earth vs. the Sci-Fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews. McFarland, 2014.

He was refused a promotion to flag rank, unless he resumed his active service at the rank of captain. He secured the command of HMS Princess Amelia, but only for a short period. He was given the rank and pay of a rear-admiral from 3 June 1757 and was placed on the superannuated list. He died in England on 16 June 1773. Notes a. The position of governor of the colony temporarily lapsed after Edwards's departure, and therefore the next commodore, James Douglas, was not a governor of the island. Also, no commodore or governor was sent in 1747, the next governor was Charles Watson in 1748.

It is a general purpose computing platform intended to reduce, or replace, paper-based reference material often found in the pilot's carry-on flight bag, including the aircraft operating manual, flight-crew operating manual, and navigational charts (including moving map for air and ground operations). In addition, the EFB can host purpose-built software applications to automate other functions normally conducted by hand, such as take-off performance calculations. The EFB gets its name from the traditional pilot's flight bag, which is typically a heavy (up to 40 lb/18 kg or more) documents bag that pilots carry to the cockpit. The electronic flight bag is the replacement of those documents in a digital format. EFB weights are typically 1 to 5 pounds (0.5 to 2.2 kg), about the same as a laptop computer, and a fraction of the weight and volume of the paper publications. Common benefits include: weight savings over traditional flight bag, reduced medical claims from handling traditional flight bags, reduced cost, and increased efficiency by reducing or eliminating paper processes. There are also claims of increased safety and reducing pilot workload. Electronic Flight Bag applications were developed to provide a solution to the everyday problems facing pilots including constantly changing NOTAM information, changing weather patterns, airport issues and delays by providing all the information required for a flight at the touch of a button. The Electronic Flight Bag allows aircrews access to their briefing pack which includes accurate, reliable, up-to-the minute data about the Operational Flight plan. weather conditions and NOTAM alerts. Crews can capture all actuals, incidents, delays, fuel, or route changes during a flight. According to the FAA's Advisory Circular (AC No. 120-76C), an Electronic Flight Bag is an electronic display system intended primarily for cockpit/flightdeck or cabin use. There are also militarized variants, with secure data storage, night vision goggle compatible lighting, environmental hardening, and military specific applications and data. EFB devices can display a variety of aviation data or perform basic calculations (including performance data and fuel calculations.). In the past, some of these functions were traditionally accomplished using paper references or were based on data provided to the flight crew by an airline's \\"flight dispatch\\" crew. For large and turbine aircraft, FAR 91.503 requires the presence of navigational charts on the airplane. If an operator's sole source of navigational chart information is contained on an EFB, the operator must demonstrate the EFB will continue to operate throughout a decompression event, and thereafter, regardless of altitude. The only way to achieve this capability is by using a solid state drive or a standard rotating mass drive in a sealed enclosure. History The earliest EFB precursors came from individual pilots in the early 1990s who used their personal laptops and common software (such as spreadsheets and word processing applications) to perform such functions as weight and balance calculations and filling out operational forms. One of the earliest and broadest EFB implementations was in 1991 when FedEx deployed their Airport Performance Laptop Computer to carry out aircraft performance calculations on the aircraft (this was a commercial off-the-shelf computer and was considered portable). In addition, FedEx also began deploying Pilot Access Terminals on their airplane in the mid-1990s. These later devices were common laptops that used a certified docking station on the airplanes (to connect to power and data interfaces). In 1996, Aero Lloyd, a German carrier, introduced two laptops to compute the performance and access the documentation. The system called FMD (Flight Management Desktop) permits Aero Lloyd to remove all the documentation and RTOW in paper from the cockpit with the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (German Civil Aviation Authority) agreement. Other companies, including Southwest followed with \\"carry-on\\" performance computers, but they remained on the airplane as a practical matter. JetBlue took a different approach by converting all of its operations documents to electronic format and distributing them over a network to laptop computers that were issued to pilots (versus to the airplane). The first true EFB, designed specifically to replace a pilot's entire kit bag, was patented by Angela Masson as the Electronic Kit Bag (EKB) in 1999.USPTO Patents # 17,974,775 Masson; Angela Electronic kit bag; and, # 27,970,531 Masson; Angela Electronic kit bag In 2005, the first commercial Class 2 EFB STC (STC No. ST03165AT) was issued to Avionics Support Group, Inc. that covered the installation of provisions for the deployment of the navAero t‚Ä¢BagC22 EFB computer and touchscreen display system. The installation was performed on a Miami Air Boeing B737NG. The EFB data was updated using a Terminal Wireless Unit (TWLU) installed at Miami Air's facility, that enabled the EFB to update only the files that had changed on the server. In 2006 MyTravel (a UK charter operation which merged with Thomas Cook airline) became the first to deploy an electronic tech log using GPRS communication, replacing the paper process. Thomas Cook had several years of successful operational experience of an EFB focused on its UK fleet. In 2009, Continental Airlines successfully completed the world‚Äôs first flight using Jeppesen Airport Surface Area Moving Map (AMM) showing ‚Äúown ship‚Äù position on a Class 2 Electronic Flight Bag platform ‚Äì which was the navAero t‚Ä¢BagC22 EFB system. The AMM application uses a high resolution database to dynamically render maps of the airport. Through the use of GPS technology, the application show pilots their position (‚Äúown-ship‚Äù) on the airport surface map. The result is much improved positional/situational awareness among flight crews which is a critical safety factor for reducing runway incursions during ground operations especially at busy commercial airports with complex runway and taxiway layouts. The STC underwhich the navAero EFB system was deployed (ST02161LA) also provided for the dual EFB systems to be cross-connected which allowed for the Airport Moving Map to be shared (or ‚Äúpushed‚Äù) from one EFB system to the other. As personal computing technology became more compact and powerful, EFBs became capable of storing all the aeronautical charts for the entire world on a single three-pound (1.4 kg) computer, compared to the 80 lb (36 kg) of paper normally required for worldwide paper charts. New technologies such as real-time satellite weather and integration with GPS have further expanded the capabilities of electronic flight bags. However, for large commercial airlines, the primary problem with EFB systems is not the hardware on the aircraft, but the means to reliably and efficiently distribute content updates to the airplane. While the adoption rate of the Electronic Flight Bag technology has been slow among large scheduled air carriers, corporate operators have been rapidly deploying EFBs since 1999 due to reduced regulatory burden and easier cost justification. The Air Force Special Operations Command purchased an initial supply of over 3,000 iPad-based EFBs which were globally fielded in July 2012. In a similar acquisition, Air Mobility Command initiated a contract for up to 18,000 iPad- based EFBs. The Air Force Special Operations Command internally developed a secure method of transferring the National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) monthly Flight Information Publications (FLIP) dataset to all its users worldwide. Both Major Commands (MAJCOMs) pursued independent efforts to ensure continuous Ops for their aircrew. After trialing iPads as EFBs in 2011, Delta Air Lines announced in August 2013 it would roll out Microsoft Surface 2 devices to its pilots, replacing a policy allowing pilots to use personal tablets as EFBs. Delta planned to roll out the tablet to all of its pilots by May 2014, after FAA approval in February. Early risk of breakage to iPads used as EFBs was addressed through rugged case design. Hardware classes Electronic Flight Bags are divided into three hardware classes and three software types. Reference: FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-76D, EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance AMC 20-25, ICAO Document 10020 \\"EFB Manual\\" and FAA Order 8900.1 Inspector Handbook (esp. Vol 4 Chap 15) for the most recent and accurate descriptions: Note: with the forthcoming release of AC 120-76D, the categorization of Electronic Flight Bag hardware into classes (below) will be retired. Going forward, EFB' s will simply be categorized as \\"Portable\\" or \\"Installed\\". Portable can be considered to consolidate the previous Class 1 and 2 distinctions, while Installed is equivalent to Class 3. These simplifications made to reduce confusion and to harmonize with already- released EASA and ICAO guidance. EFB hardware classes include: * Class 1 ‚Äì Standard commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment such as laptops or handheld electronic devices. These devices are used as loose equipment and are typically stowed during critical phases of flight. A Class 1 EFB is considered a Portable Electronic Device (PED). Class 1 EFBs, such as Cockpit iPads, may be used to display Type B applications in critical phases of flight provided that they are 'secured and viewable'. * Class 2 ‚Äì Also Portable Electronic Devices, and range from modified COTS equipment to purpose-built devices. Mounting, power (ship's power as primary) or data connectivity of an EFB typically requires the application of an STC, Type Certificate or Amended Type Certificate. (ref: FAA Order 8900.1) * Class 3 ‚Äì Considered \\"installed equipment\\" and subject to airworthiness requirements and, unlike PEDs, they must be under design control. The hardware is subject to a limited number of RTCA DO-160E requirements (for non-essential equipment‚Äîtypical crash safety and Conducted and Radiated Emissions testing). Class 3 EFBs are typically installed under STC or other airworthiness approval. Note: With the release of AC 120-76D, the EFB classes are removed and the document introduces a simpler concept of portable and installed equipment, to harmonize with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and to accommodate increasingly complex systems integrating both installed and portable equipment.FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-76D. Applications The EFB may host a wide array of applications, categorized in three software categories (Reference AC 120-76 as amended, for an actual list of examples): * Type A ** Static applications, such as document viewer (PDF, HTML, XML formats); ** Flight Crew Operating Manuals, and other printed documents like airport NOTAM; * Type B ** Static or dynamic electronic \\"charts\\" to include (though not requiring) panning, zooming, and scrolling; (AC120-76(), Appendix B) * Type C ** For example: Airport Moving Map functionality deployed under a Technical Standard Order Authorization, and some elements of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast system Note: Type C applications are subject to airworthiness requirements and as such must be developed in conformance with DO-178()/ED-12() objectives. Type C applications must run on Class 3 EFB. Note: with the forthcoming release of AC 120-76D, reference to Type C applications will be removed, and their functionality will no longer be recognized as EFB functions. Regulations According to the FAA, Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 EFB may act as a substitute for the paper manuals that pilots are otherwise required to carry with them. While Part 91 Operators (those not flying for hire, including private and corporate operators) can use their Pilot In Command (PIC) authority to approve the use of Class 1 and Class 2 EFBs (which are PEDs), operator with OpSpecs (Part 135, Part 121) must seek operational approval through the OpSpecs process. EFB users and installers should be aware of recent, clarified guidance for FAA Inspectors. Draft guidance pertaining to EFB operational authorization and airworthiness/certification requirements is maintained by the FAA.FAA: EFB operational authorization and airworthiness/certification requirements Clarifying the intent of FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-76A, new draft inspector handbook guidance includes the following requirements: * PEDs used in a Class 1 or Class 2 configuration must meet the rapid decompression testing requirements of standard RTCA DO-160E. * Any data connectivity of PEDs used in a Class 1 or Class 2 configuration to aircraft systems shall be performed in accordance with a Supplemental Type Certificate, Type Certificate or Amended Type Certificate. * Any mounting or attachment of PEDs used in a Class 1 or Class 2 configuration to the aircraft shall be performed in accordance with a Supplemental Type Certificate, Type Certificate or Amended Type Certificate. * Electronic chart software: The display of own-ship position (\\"spotter\\") on the ground must meet the requirements of AC 120-76C and/or TSO C-165. * Electronic chart software: The display of own-ship position in flight is prohibited on Class 1 or 2 configurations.

Owned by Cumulus Media, the station broadcasts a country music format targeting Grand Rapids. History The station was first assigned the call sign WPLB-FM in 1962 and was originally licensed to Greenville, Michigan. It was sister station to WPLB (AM) (1060 and later 1380). The station became oldies-formatted on November 15, 1989 and the call sign was changed to WODJ. The WPLB-FM call sign was subsequently moved to 106.3 FM in Lakeview, Michigan (the AM and FM are now known as WGLM). =WODJ= WPLB-FM became WODJ, an oldies station targeting the Grand Rapids market, in 1989, and was an immediate success, reaching number one in the 12+ Arbitron ratings for Grand Rapids the following year. The station's success was built on its visibility at community events, such as the Grand Center Boat Show, which took place at the Grand Center in downtown Grand Rapids. By 2000, however, the station was struggling to make the top ten in 12+ ratings. Oldies 107.3 also featured the syndicated Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember, which aired on Sunday afternoons. =WKLQ= On October 11, 2004, WODJ and the oldies format was replaced by Active rock station WKLQ, which had been replaced by country music station WTNR after 20 years on 94.5 FM. The WODJ calls were most recently used by Citadel Broadcasting on talk-radio station 1490 AM in Whitehall, Michigan which was also replaced by the WKLQ call sign in 2009. The call sign is now held by Mentor Partners of Big Rapids, Michigan, on a construction permit for a new AM station for 1590 kHz. Shortly before KLQ's move to 107.3, they hired Justice and Jim for mornings. In summer 2005, the duo created controversy when they announced on the air that they were going to drown a dog. The announcement persuaded several listeners to call 911. A day later, they announced that it was only a stunt. On July 19, 2006, Justice and Jim were fired and replaced by The Opie and Anthony Show. WKLQ launched Grey & Kluck mornings featuring Grand Rapids market veteran Michael Grey and Warren Kluck on July 17, 2008. Kluck spent three years previously doing morning drive at WRKR-FM in Kalamazoo, MI. Repeater station WKOQ (92.5 FM) signed on the air on August 15, 2005; the WODJ call sign that was abandoned by WKLQ in 2004 had been parked on this frequency prior to going on the air. It transmitted from the same tower as television station WZZM in Newaygo County, near Grant. The simulcast was terminated on May 1, 2006 when the station became WLAW-FM, \\"The Outlaw,\\" airing a blend of country music and Southern Rock. =WBBL-FM= On May 28, 2009, WKLQ was replaced with sister station WBBL-FM, which was previously on the AM dial (now WJRW), and WKLQ was made an exclusive web- station. The Grey and Kluck Morning show was pulled off the air. Warren Kluck went to do the Kevin Matthews Morning Show. Michael Grey went on to The Starting Line Up with Bret Bakita on the new WBBL-FM. Michael Grey left WBBL- FM in May 2011. Ray Bentley, former inside linebacker for the Buffalo Bills has stepped in and the show has been rebranded as \\"Bakita & Bentley.\\" Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. After having a \\"revolving door\\" of morning drive hosts, Eric Zane (formerly of \\"The Free Beer and Hotwings Show\\") started his own show on April 20, 2016 as a 4-hour general talk show with showtime between 6 A.M. and 10 A.M. Though starting as a 4-hour program, in June 2017, the show dropped its 4th hour in favor of \\"The Sudden Death Podcast\\". The show was co-hosted by long-time WBBL-FM Morning producer Julius (or \\"OJ\\") until September 29, 2017. Current Producer Ben will fill in as Co-Host. On January 4, 2019, it was reported that WBBL-FM's program director and entire airstaff had been laid off. Later that evening, the station began simulcasting WTNR's country format, with both stations re- branded as Thunder 94.5 & 107.3. An agreement was made for Bill Simonson's The Huge Show to move to WJRW and WKLQ, which also re-launched as The Ticket. The simulcast was used to transition WTNR's country format to 107.3; WTNR flipped to an adult album alternative format (later reinstating the WKLQ calls) on January 19, 2019. =WTNR= The station changed its call sign to the current WTNR on February 13, 2019.

After attending Sheffield Hallam University where he gained a BA Hons degree and Manchester Metro University, where he qualified as a teacher, Blow emigrated to Australia in 1982. Since then he has made his living by teaching and through his artwork. More recently the emphasis has been on his art, as his work has increasingly become a featured part of private and public collections in Australia, including Artbank, The Art Gallery of Western Australia, University of Western Australia and the collections of the cities of Bunbury, Albany and Fremantle. In 2001 Judith McGrath reviewed his 2001 solo show at The Church Gallery: Left to right: Godfrey Blow, Odysseus Yakoumakis and Jacqueline Jones at The Triumph of Stuckism show and symposium, Liverpool Biennial 2006. He first joined the Stuckists in 2002, when he founded the Perth Stuckists after a conversation with Stuckism founder, Charles Thomson. Since then he has exhibited with the group, most notably in their landmark exhibition, The Stuckists Punk Victorian at the Walker Art Gallery during the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. He is also one of the featured artists exhibiting in the Triumph of Stuckism; an exhibition of new Stuckist paintings curated by Naive John, which comprises part of Liverpool's 2006 Biennial. His highly finished paintings are worked on over many months, and draw mainly from the often arid and rocky landscape which surrounds his home. In his use of hot, earth colours and crisp detail, he is quintessentially an Australian artist pursuing typically Australian themes.

Activities include picnicking, swimming and diving, and wildlife viewing. Among the wildlife of the park are deer, bobcats, raccoon, squirrels, beaver and otters, as well as turkey, blue heron and barred owls. The park name commemorates the work of diver and explorer Wes Skiles. Prior to 2010 the park was known as Peacock Springs State Park. Amenities include a nature trail, six sinkholes, and Peacock and Bonnet Springs, with miles of underwater caves popular with cave divers. The two springs are tributaries of the Suwannee River. The park is open from 8:00 am till sundown year round. Expansion In 2006, The Trust for Public Land purchased approximately for expansion of the park. This donation more than doubled the size of the park that was previously . Cave System Entrance to cave system. The Peacock cave system is a karst environment in limestone. The Peacock Springs Cave system was first explored by Vasco Murray in 1956. The first map of the system was completed by the National Speleological Society team leader, Sheck Exley, in 1995. Exley's team made over 521 dives to complete the survey. A resurvey of the system was completed in 1996 by a team led by Michael Poucher. As of June 13, 2008, the Peacock cave system was the 24th longest underwater cave in the world at 7408 meters. In 2010, a connection was made by Agnes Milowka and James Toland between Baptizing and Peacock springs, extending the total length of the system an additional . http://www.agnesmilowka.com/2010-november/107-peacock-springs-connection On April 25, 2002, in order to protect the cave system from damage, the park stopped allowing divers to use Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPV). It is one of the largest underwater caves in the continental United States with over of explored passageway. The cave system consists of seven major springs and sink holes, six of which are located within Peacock Springs State Park. Peacock Springs is a popular destination for cave divers all over the world and is extensively used to train new cave divers. Springs and Sinkholes =Peacock I= The Peacock I Spring is the most accessible and most popular site in the system with an elevated walkway and stairs leading to the spring. There are three passageways that converge on the spring called the Pothole tunnel, the Peanut tunnel and the Peacock II tunnel. Each of these three tunnels has a permanent guideline (called a gold line) placed in it to ease navigation by cave divers. Pothole Tunnel The Pothole tunnel, named for the sinkhole down the tunnel from Peacock I, is the deepest of the three tunnels with a maximum depth of . It contains large open passageways, relatively high ceilings and a silt bottom. The walls are often covered in silt but occasionally the silt will be blown away by floods exposing the white limestone underneath. Peanut Tunnel The Peanut tunnel is a relatively shallow and narrow tunnel. It is named for a section that resembles the two lobes of a peanut. Its depths range from . At approximately into the tunnel, crossover tunnels connect the Peanut tunnel to the Pothole tunnel. Peacock II Tunnel The Peacock II tunnel leads to Peacock II spring. =Peacock II= Peacock II Spring is a smaller spring than Peacock I. It is one of only two sites available for diving by open water divers, as it contains no access to the cave system. =Pothole= Pothole is a small inline sink approximately one third of the distance between Peacock I and Olsen. The sink hole has a very small entrance into the Peacock Springs cave system and due to the steep sides, it is inaccessible to cave divers. =Olsen Sink= Olsen is a small inline sinkhole approximately from Peacock I down the Pothole tunnel. There are two small entrances into the cave system at Olsen dropping into the same tunnel. Being central to the cave system, Olsen was once a popular entrance for cave divers as it allowed easy access to much of the cave. To prevent erosion, cave divers are no longer permitted to enter at Olsen sink as of 2002, although it remains a popular place to temporarily surface during a dive. =Orange Grove= Orange Grove is a large terminal sinkhole northeast of Peacock I. With a raised walkway and stairs leading into the sink hole, it is a popular entrance into the cave. Two winding tunnels extend from the sink hole called Lower Orange Grove and Upper Orange Grove. Lower Orange Grove is a deeper tunnel extending down to . As a very advanced dive, it is not as popular as Upper Orange Grove. Upper Orange Grove is a winding tunnel in all three dimensions starting at deep and becoming as shallow as . The tunnel extends outside Peacock Spring State Park to Challenge Sink. =Challenge Sink= Challenge is an inline sink, the northernmost sinkhole in the system, and is the only sinkhole outside of the Peacock Springs State Park. Steep sides makes entering and exiting Challenge difficult. It is a popular destination for divers entering Upper Orange Grove. =Cisteen Sink= Cisteen is a large offset sink like Orange Grove. It offers a very small, silty entrance to the cave system, and is usually covered in a thick layer of duckweed. =Peacock III= Peacock III is a siphon, meaning it takes in water rather than discharging it, as a spring would. Peacock III has a separate system from Peacock I, II, and its related sinks. The system is very low, silty, and shallow, except for one room, Henley's Castle, which drops to depths of over . =Waterhole= Waterhole is another offset sink. It contains geological features not seen in the rest of the system, such as low bedding planes, as opposed to the vaulted ceilings found in the rest of the system.

Masten Space Systems is an aerospace manufacturer startup company in Mojave, California (formerly Santa Clara, California) that is developing a line of vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) rockets, initially for uncrewed research sub-orbital spaceflights and eventually intended to support robotic orbital spaceflight launches. In 2020, NASA awarded Masten a contract for a lunar lander mission; NASA is to pay Masten 75.9 million USD for Masten to build and launch a lander called XL-1 to take NASA and other customer payloads to the south pole of the Moon. This mission will be Masten's first space flight; it is scheduled for late 2022.  Overview  Masten Space Systems is a Mojave, California based rocket company that is currently developing a line of reusable VTVL spacecraft, and related rocket propulsion hardware. Masten Space Systems competed in the NASA and Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge X Prize in 2009, winning the level one second prize of US$150,000 and the level two first prize of US$1,000,000. On 2 November 2009, it was announced that Masten Space Systems had won first place in the level two category, with Armadillo Aerospace coming in second. Masten Space Systems was selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative of the NASA on 30 April 2014. Masten was accepted to make a bid for NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program on 29 November 2018. Masten proposed to NASA that Masten would develop a lunar lander called XL-1 to take scientific payload to the Moon. NASA accepted this proposal to be assessed, whether it would be developed or not, as part of the CLPS program. NASA will later choose which of the bids made for CLPS program by the various companies eligible to bid for CLPS the agency will eventually fund for development. On 8 April 2020, it was announced that NASA had selected Masten's CLPS bid to be developed. NASA awarded Masten a $75.9 million contract to build, launch, land and operate their XL-1 Moon lander. The lander will take payload from NASA and other customers to the south pole of the Moon. The mission is scheduled for late 2022. = Xombie = Masten's Xombie (model XA-0.1B) won the second prize in the Level One competition of the Lunar Lander Challenge on 7 October 2009 with an average landing accuracy of . The primary goal of these two airframes was to demonstrate stable, controlled flight using a GN&C; system developed in-house at Masten. XA-0.1B originally featured four engines with thrust, but was converted in Spring 2009 to be powered by one engine of thrust. By October 2009, the regeneratively cooled isopropyl alcohol and liquid oxygen rocket engine was running at around . XA-0.1B, nicknamed \\"Xombie\\", first flew free of tether 19 September 2009, and qualified for the Lunar Lander Challenge Level One second prize of $150,000 on 7 October 2009. In October 2016, NASA reported using Xombie to test the Landing Vision System (LVS), as part of the Autonomous Descent and Ascent Powered-flight Testbed (ADAPT) experimental technologies, for the Mars 2020 mission landing. , Xombie has flown 224 times. = Xoie = Masten's Xoie (model XA-0.1E) won the Level Two prize of the Lunar Lander Challenge on October 30, 2009. They beat Armadillo Aerospace by just a bit more than of total landing accuracy, with an average accuracy of about on the two landings in the round-trip competition flight. Xoie has an aluminum frame and features a version of Masten's thrust engine that produces around of thrust. \\"Xoie\\", as the craft is nicknamed, qualified for the Lunar Lander Challenge level two on October 30, 2009. =Xaero= The Xaero reusable launch vehicle is a vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing (VTVL) rocket which is being developed by Masten in 2010‚Äì2011. It has been proposed to NASA as a potential suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) for carrying research payloads under NASA's Flight Opportunities Program (initially known as the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research/CRuSR program), projecting altitude in initial flights of five to six minutes duration, while carrying a research payload. It is propelled by the Cyclops-AL-3 rocket engine burning isopropyl alcohol and liquid oxygen. The first Xaero test vehicle flew 110 test flights before being destroyed in its 111th flight. During the record-setting flight on 11 September 2012, an engine valve stuck open during descent, was sensed by the control system. As designed, the flight termination system was triggered, destroying the vehicle before it could create a range safety problem. The final test flight was intended to test the vehicle at higher wind loads and altitudes, flying to an altitude of one kilometer while testing the flight controls at the higher ascent and descent velocities before returning to a precise landing point. The ascent and initial portion of the descent was nominal, prior to the stuck throttle valve which resulted in the termination of the flight prior to the planned precision landing. =Xaero-B= A follow up to Xaero with the ability to reach altitude with engine on throughout. Xaero-B is between 15 and 16 feet tall where Xaero was 12 feet tall. Xaero-B is proceeding through hot-fire testing. It will be used for the bulk of research flights up to initial altitudes between to . The vehicle has now been retired due to damage on a test flight in April 2017. It flew 75 times. = Xodiac = The Xodiac is a VTVL rocket introduced in 2016. It features pressure-fed LOX/IPA propellant, and a regeneratively cooled engine. Flights can simulate landing on the Moon or Mars. Video of Xodiac performing in-flight air flow tests Tuft strings. = Xeus = Xeus (pronounced Zeus) is a vertical-landing, vertical-takeoff lunar lander demonstrator. Xeus consists of a Centaur upper stage (from United Launch Alliance) with RL-10 main engine to which four Katana vertical thrusters have been added. Production Xeus is estimated to be able to land on the Moon with up to 14 tonnes (revised to 10 tonnes) payload when using the expendable version or 5 tonnes payload when using the reusable version. The damaged Centaur on the demonstrator Xeus limits it to Earth flights. The production versions would have to be manufacturing fault free and certified for space operations. Human rating may also be needed. United Launch Alliance, supplier of the Centaur, refer to Xeus as an abbreviation for eXperimental Enhanced Upper Stage. Further details of the proposed design are given in the paper \\"Experimental Enhanced Upper Stage (XEUS): An affordable large lander system\\". Each of the Katanas used on a Xeus lander are likely to produce when performing a horizontal touchdown. In December 2012, Masten demonstrated their all-aluminum regeneratively-cooled engine, the KA6A. The talk in this video announced the Xeus also shows NASA's Space Exploration Vehicle rover with its two astronauts as a possible payload for the XEUS. On 30 April 2014, the NASA announced that Masten Space Systems was one of the three companies selected for the Lunar CATALYST initiative. NASA signed an unfunded Space Act Agreement (SAA) with Masten in September 2014. The SAA lasts until August 2017, has 22 milestone and calls for \\"End-to- end demonstration of hardware and software that enables a commercial lander on the Moon.\\" In December 2015, United Launch Alliance (ULA) were planning to upgrade the XEUS's main body from a Centaur Upper Stage to the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) which they are currently developing, significantly increasing the payload. Masten Space intend to incorporate experience from developing the XL family of cargo landers into the XEUS family of landers. In August 2016, ULA's President and CEO said ULA intend to human rate both the Vulcan and ACES. XEUS was cancelled in July 2018. =XL-1= The XL-1 is a small cargo lunar lander that Masten is developing as part of the Lunar CATALYST program (SAAM ID 18250). When powered by MXP-351 the XL-1 is designed to land payloads onto the surface of the Moon. As of August 2017, Masten Space expects the XL-1 to have 4 main engines which are being prototyped on the XL-1T and a wet mass of about . On 11 October 2016, Masten Space Tweeted a video showing the test firing of its new bi-propellant combination, internally called MXP-351. The test used an existing engine with an experimental injector, the first 'Machete', producing thrust. Development of their 3D printed regen lunar engine that will use MXP-351 to land on the Moon continues. , a thrust version of Machete for the terrestrial testbed of the lander, dubbed XL-1T, is being manufactured. In October 2017, the NASA extended the Lunar CATALYST agreement for 2 years. On 29 November 2018, it was announced that Masten was eligible to bid at a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract by NASA. Should the proposal be accepted by NASA to be built, the landing to Moon would be no earlier than 2021. On 8 April 2020, NASA selected Masten to deliver eight payloads ‚Äì with nine science and technology instruments ‚Äì to the South Pole of the Moon in 2022 with the XL-1 lander. Masten will also operate the payloads, helping to lay the foundation for human expeditions to the lunar surface beginning in 2024. The payloads, which include instruments to assess the composition of the lunar surface, test precision landing technologies, and evaluate the radiation on the Moon, are being delivered under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative as part of the agency's Artemis program. The US$75.9 million award includes end-to-end services for delivery of the instruments, including payload integration, launch from Earth, landing on the surface of the Moon, and operation for at least 12 days. The payloads have predominantly been developed through two recent NASA Provided Lunar Payloads (NPLP) and Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP) solicitations. On 26 August 2020, Masten announced that the first XL-1 mission will be launched by SpaceX, although it is not yet publicly known which SpaceX launch vehicle it will fly on.SpaceX to Launch Masten Lunar Mission in 2022. Meagan Crawford, Masten Press Release. August 26, 2020. =XL-1T= The XT-1T is a (T)errestrial technology and process demonstrator for the XL-1 and XEUS. A terrestrial flying test-bed is being used since lack of vehicle access to lunar landers after launch would make Masten's incremental design and test development methodology difficult and very expensive. Like the XL-1, the XL-1T is under development in partnership with NASA CATALYST (SAAM ID 18250). The XL-1T is expected to have a dry mass of 588.93 kg and a wet mass of 1270.68 kg which is less than the XL-1. The vehicle has 4 off Machete 4400 N main engines able to throttle between 25% and 100% (4:1). The propellant is MPX-351. Yaw and pitch are controlled by differential throttling. There are 4 off 22 N ACS thrusters to control roll. Many characteristics of the XL-1T have been deliberately made similar to the XL-1. These include multi-engine architecture, avionics, software, fuel, movement of inertia, slosh management, and mission design tools. =XS-1= Masten has been awarded a contract from DARPA to develop the XS-1 experimental spaceplane.Masten Space Systems, Inc. award notice, US government document, June 27, 2014. Project ended as DARPA awarded the Phase 2 to Boeing. Other products and services In addition to its line of vehicles, Masten Space Systems is currently offering its internally developed igniters and engines commercially to interested and qualified parties. Masten also has stated its intent at multiple conferences to participate in technology maturation and proof of concept projects. = Broadsword = Broadsword is a methane/liquid oxygen rocket engine Masten Space Systems is developing for the US government. Advanced manufacturing techniques will permit the engine to be used to provide a lower-cost reusable launch service for the growing CubeSat and smallsat launch market. The prototype engine took 1.5 months to construct and is made of aluminium. The engine consists of 3 parts that are bolted together. The engine uses an expander cyclehttp://masten.aero/2017/05/masten-achieves-first-hot-fire-of-broadsword- rocket-engine/ and may produce with a bell extension in vacuum. The development of a technology demonstration unit was completed in September 2016. The hot-fire test campaign concluded with the demonstration of six successful engine starts. , a second development unit containing enhancements was being developed for NASA under the Tipping Point program with the aim of being flight qualified. = Cutlass = Cutlass is a methane/liquid oxygen rocket engine Masten Space Systems was developing for the US government. Built using aluminium alloy via additive manufacturing techniques. Cutlass evolved into a low cost expendable upper stage engine using a gas generator cycle. A Phase 2 SBIR grant was not awarded so development has been put on hold. = Katana = Katana class engines produce up to of thrust and are regeneratively cooled. They are designed for indefinite runtime and good throttle response. A video of the all aluminium Katana KA6A Regen 2800 lbf engine's shake down test burning LOX/IPA (Isopropyl alcohol). = Machete = Machete is the name for a family of throttle rocket engine designs Masten Space Systems is developing to permit their XL-1 lunar lander to land on the Moon. The Machete rocket engines burn the nontoxic storable hypergolic propellant combination MXP-351. The first Machete had an experimental injector design that was used to test MXP-351 in 2016, producing a thrust of 225 lbf. , Masten is modifying the design to make the engines additively-manufactured with regeneratively-cooled thrust chambers. Machete engines are being scaled up to produce 1000 lb thrust for a terrestrial test-bed version dubbed (XL-1T). =MXP-351= MXP-351 is Masten Space's internal name for a self-igniting bipropellant combination invented to fuel its small lunar landers. Unlike the traditional NTO/MMH bipropellant, the two propellant chemicals in MXP-351 are safer to handle because they are nontoxic. The bipropellant can also be stored at room temperatures, unlike liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The hypergolic combination has an ISP of 322 seconds. The storage life of MXP-351 before use is undergoing long term studies but is expected to be a few years. The reduced operation constraints may permit a reduction in recurring operating costs. For handling instructions see the section on Safety below. = Masten Mission One= Masten Space Systems will launch a lunar lander mission called Masten Mission One or MM1 in late 2022, using a SpaceX Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. It will have a suite of payloads for NASA.\\"https://spacenews.com/spacex-to-launch-masten-lunar-lander/\\" Safety Masten Space use similar precautions when handling MXP-351 to those used for HTP (High-Test Peroxide). These include wearing splash protection clothing plus a simple chemical respirator. They claim that spills can be rectified by diluting with water and rinsing away.

The Young Boys were innovative, opening franchises in other cities, promoting brand names, and unleashing extreme brutality to frighten away rivals. Y.B.I. emerged at the end of the 1970s. Their modus operandi was using minors to be couriers of heroin. If police captured them, they were ineligible to receive the same criminal penalties as adults because of their juvenile status. Meanwhile, the leaders, adults aged in their late teens and very early 20s, remained largely insulated from law enforcement action for many years.Simonich, Milan. \\"How Detroit gang got to New Castle.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. March 5, 2006. Retrieved on January 3, 2012. \\"Every cop working a beat generally knows about the criminal system that Young Boys Incorporated started during the 1970s.\\" History In 1976, the group was formed by a small bunch of Detroit neighborhood friends all in their late teens at Birney Elementary School's playground. Dwayne Davis (a.k.a. Wonderful Wayne), and Charles Lindsey (a.k.a. Choicey Chuck) were the original founders at the time. Shortly after the formation of Y.B.I., a man from the same neighborhood named Raymond Peoples joined and became a boss. Two years later, Butch Jones (a.k.a. Big Boy) was paroled from prison and joined the organization. It was about this time that Y.B.I. split into three separate crews: Dwayne Davis, Raymond Peoples, and Butch Jones. They controlled 80% of the heroin traffic in Detroit from the summer of 1978 through 1982. From the start, Y.B.I.'s main place of operation was the Dexter/Davison neighborhood on Detroit's Northwest side. About two years after its formation, Y.B.I. completely took over the heroin trade in and around Detroit with sales estimated at about $300,000 per day. After the split, Davis sent one of his top lieutenants to Boston to expand his operation. After about a year, the crew, along with new members from Boston, took over most of that city's heroin trade. Sales peaked in Boston at about $50,000 per day. The organization in Detroit was seriously crippled in September 1982, when it was alleged that Butch Jones ordered the execution of Davis over a turf dispute. Davis was gunned down at the corner of Columbus and Lawton on Detroit's west side. A few months later, on December 7, Raymond Peoples, Butch Jones, and 41 of Y.B.I.'s top Lieutenants were indicted, convicted, and later sentenced to long prison terms. Many believed that because of Davis' death, none of his crew were indicted. After Peoples was released from prison, he was shot dead as he sat in a car on the city's west side in 1985. The one lieutenant that Davis sent to Boston, James \\"Pep\\" Cooper, came back to Detroit after Davis' death and took over what was left of Y.B.I. They operated for about another six years, taking the group to another level until federal indictments came down on various group members, and crack cocaine quickly became the inner-city drug of choice over heroin. One of the members who came back from Boston with Cooper was Steven Sealy. Sealy is best known for being gunned down and killed as he sat in Whitney Houston's Bentley in front of a Boston club. In the car with him was Bobby Brown. Butch Jones was released after serving 12 years in federal prison. He was eventually indicted again on drug and murder charges. Jones cooperated with federal authorities for a lesser sentence. Y.B.I'.s reputation and system of organization impacted and influenced drug gangs nationally during the 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, after their downfall, other black Detroit drug cartels copied their organizational structure. Many gangs, such as \\"Best Friends\\", \\"Pony Down\\", \\"Black Mafia Family\\", and \\"The Chambers Brothers\\", rose to prominence in the wake of the YBI and were featured together in a Black Entertainment Television documentary series entitled American Gangster.

During the 1980s, she received a grant from A.F.I. as one of the first women to direct short films for them (along with Cicely Tyson, Joanne Woodward, and others). She wrote, directed and acted in her film, Good Night, Sweet Prince, which received excellent notices. In the 1970s, she met Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan and other activists at the First Women‚Äôs Sexual Conference at Barnard College in New York City. From there, she started consciousness-raising groups and counseling workshops for Women and Incest. In the early 1990s, she returned to Canada and resettled in Victoria, British Columbia, and Saint- Hippolyte, Quebec. She had been a long-term permanent resident of the United States, but remained a Canadian citizen all her life. She was a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers). =Death= Sherwood died on April 23, 2016, at her childhood home in Lac Cornu, Quebec. No cause of death was disclosed.

Operation In a steam locomotive, draft is produced in the firebox by exhausting the steam coming from the cylinders out of the chimney, or also by a blower. The Lempor ejector ejects differently from the conventional blastpipe; as one cylinder ejects it creates a vacuum in the other cylinder, thereby requiring less power to drive the piston.

Designed by Willie Watson under the supervision of Walter Owen Bentley of Bentley Motors Limited, it vaulted Aston Martin to fame as a maker of desirable sports and racing cars. History Towards the end of World War II, W. O. Bentley began working on a new straight-6 engine for the Lagonda marque. Bentley had taken a seat on Lagonda's board of directors when Alan Good bought and re-organized Lagonda in June 1935. Bentley had completed his obligatory three years term with former rival Rolls-Royce following their 1931 acquisition of his former business. They had refused to return it to racing and had replaced many of his chassis and engine designs with their own. It was clear Lagonda's successful V12 would be seen as too extravagant for the postwar market. Bentley and his team developed a modern dual overhead cam straight-6 engine. It initially displaced 2.6 L (2580 cc/157 in3) with a 78 mm (3.07 in) bore and 90 mm (3.543 in) stroke and produced roughly 105 hp (78 kW) with dual SU carburettors. The Lagonda straight-6 caught the attention of David Brown, who had purchased Aston Martin in 1947. Aston's Claude Hill-designed four-cylinder was not powerful enough for Brown, who desired a powerful, and high-tech, powerplant for Aston Martin. So Brown purchased Lagonda as well, incorporating Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. that same year. The first production vehicle to use Bentley's new engine was the 1948 Lagonda 2.6-Litre. This was a large car for the place and time, available as either a 4-door saloon or 2-door convertible, and it could only reach 84 mph (135 km/h). Sales were slow, but Aston's 4-cylinder 2-Litre Sports model was barely selling at all. Brown decided to share the straight-6 with Aston, creating the wildly successful DB2 model. This car placed first and second in class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on its introduction in 1950, propelling Aston Martin into the top tier of post-war sports car companies. The 2.6 L straight-6 went on to power the DB3 racing car and DB2/4 road car, before being enlarged to 2.9 L (2922 cc/178 in3 83 mm x 90 mm) in 1952 for the DB3, in 1953 for the DB2/4 Mk1 Saloon in September 1953 & April 1954 for the DB2/4 Mk1 DHC. Power eventually reached 195 hp the (145 kW) with triple twin-choke Weber carburettors in the \\"DBB\\"-spec DB Mark III after a Tadek Marek substantial redesign, but the engine by then was showing its age. It was replaced for the DB4 and later cars by a 3.7 L straight-6 designed by Tadek Marek.

They first appeared in 1968, created by Jim Shooter as a criminal organization founded by five members and populated by a multitude of clones of the original five members. The Dark Circle concept was later modified to consist of members from five core worlds instead of clones. A later version, after DC Comics rebooted their history, was led by Brainiac 4 and had several known Legion of Super-Heroes enemies among their ranks instead of the previous generic masked henchmen. Fictional history The Dark Circle first appeared in Adventure Comics #367 as an insurgent group planning to conquer the United Planets in the 30th century. It was composed of only five people and armies of clones created from those five people. The Dark Circle remained mostly shrouded in mystery, even with its defeat by the Legion of Super-Heroes. They launched a direct invasion of Earth during the Legion's Adventure Comics run, following an attack by the Fatal Five that had left the Legion and Earth's defenses devastated, and were in the process of overwhelming both when Brainiac 5 discovered the Miracle Machine and used it to repulse the attack, returning all the Dark Circle soldiers to their homeworlds. They then sought to invade Earth indirectly through others, most notably the Khunds and Dominators whom they manipulated into what became known as the Earthwar. As part of their machinations, they also released Mordru, hoping to use him against the Legion. This proved to be a mistake, however, as Mordru instead gained control of the Dark Circle. This was not immediately apparent, though, as he continued with the plans they had already drawn up. Eventually Mordru and the Circle were defeated. The Dark Circle was referenced during the Giffen-Bierbaum continuity. Members were depicted wearing hoods with a prominent dark circle (zero) over the face. In Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #2, they were said to have existed for millions of years, even before New Genesis and Apokolips. They had little influence over events and were outmaneuvered by other factions who were prominent during this period. The Legion member Tellus joined the Dark Circle during this time. Instead of five individuals cloned, now they were formed primarily from five worlds. The Circle here was portrayed as more of a philosophical or quasi-religious movement, one which specifically turned aside from intellectual knowledge, and instead focused on emotions, primarily those termed \\"blood\\" emotions such as anger and fear. They did maintain a high level of technology however, with a renegade Dominator world supplying most of the tech. Their primary foe, as depicted in LSH Annual #2 (v4) was Valor, who not only opposed them physically, but philosophically as well. The influence of Valor on many worlds was the main obstacle to their plans. When the Dominators conquered the earth, the Dark Circle secretly aided the resistance movement, hoping to gain control of the planet themselves. However, the group was ultimately betrayed by its ally, Universo. =Post-Zero Hour= The Dark Circle also played a part in the post-Zero Hour reboot of the Legion, in which it was the secret power behind the Affiliated Planets (a rival political grouping to the United Planets) and was run by Brainiac 4. Other members of the Circle included Tyr, and the leaders of the Khunds, the Gil'Dishpan, the Dominators, and the Sklarian Raiders. All were killed by Brainiac 4 when they realized the level of her insanity. Members * Ontiir - A member of the Dark Circle from the planet Tsauron. Killed by Kimball Zendak. * Grullug Garkush - A member of the Dark Circle from the planet N'cron. * Norak Kun - A member of the Dark Circle from the planet Naltor. * Gorgoth - A member of the Dark Circle from the planet Fresish. * Rolind Siepur - A member of the Dark Circle from the planet Arane II. Other versions In issue three of the Tangent: Superman's Reign series, a version of the Dark Circle is briefly seen. This version is a necromancer cult, with such members as Etrigan, Bane and Sargon. =Phantom Stranger antagonist= An unrelated Dark Circle appeared as Phantom Stranger's adversaries in Phantom Stranger #20 (July‚ÄìAugust 1972).

Their origin is not elaborated upon. The Dark Circle leaders Gullug (voiced by Dave Wittenberg) and Ontirr (voiced by Bumper Robinson) become aware of the Legion of Super Heroes via Dream Girl and plan to capture her so that they can use her to their advantage.

Tourism and Facilities  The treeless summit of the Gro√üer Feldberg and the surrounding forests are a popular destination for motorbikers and cyclists in the summer, tobogganers and cross-country skiers in winter, and hikers year-round. Two small rope tow ski lifts are located on the North and West slopes of the mountain at the village of Oberreifenberg, and a larger ski lift used to extend up the North slope almost to the summit until the 1980s. The former lift track is popular with tobogganers. The summit is easily reached from Frankfurt in approximately 30 minutes via roads from Oberursel, K√∂nigstein or by bus from these towns. Since the top can be easily reached by car, crowds and a lack of parking spaces near the top are a common sight on weekends in fine weather.

It was the first model from that company following its purchase by David Brown in 1947 and was named for the new straight-6 engine which debuted with the car. The so-called Lagonda Straight-6 engine was designed by Walter Owen Bentley and would propel Lagonda's new parent company, Aston Martin, to fame. The 2.6-Litre was a larger car than the Aston Martins models which were being produced under David Brown's ownership and was available as a 4-door saloon and, from 1949, as 2-door drophead coup√©, both with 4 seats. The drophead was bodied by Tickford, at the time not part of Aston Martin. A Mark II version appeared in 1952, in saloon form only, with engine power increased to 125 bhp. The car sold reasonably well, in spite of being an expensive car and being launched so soon after the war, with 510 examples made when production ended in 1953. The car had a separate chassis and all independent suspension using coil springs at the front and torsion bars at the rear. At introduction it was believed to be the only all-independently sprung British car. The Lockheed brakes had drums at the front and at the rear with the latter being mounted inboard. Rack and pinion steering was used. A drophead version tested by The Motor magazine in 1949 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 17.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£3,420 including taxes.

It originally opened as an enclosed shopping mall in August 1965 with Buttrey Food & Drug, Tempo, and Sprouse-Reitz as anchor stores. It was the largest shopping mall in the Treasure Valley until the opening of Boise Towne Square in Boise in October 1988. The shopping center is anchored by Big 5 Sporting Goods, Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts, Mor Furniture, and Ross. In 2019, the mall was sold to Rhino Investments, which began a major renovation project that included the demolition of of the mall's floor area. Future plans include the addition of several new tenants and several residential buildings. History The exterior of the mall's now-closed Macy's store. Daum Industries began construction on a former alfalfa field located at the intersection of Karcher Road and U.S. Highway 30 in 1963. The mall was completed and opened on August 26, 1965 with anchor stores Buttrey Food & Drug, Tempo, and Sprouse-Reitz. During 1967, Daum Industries persuaded JCPenney to open a department store at the two-year-old shopping center. In March 1967, construction on a $3.5 million expansion of the shopping mall began, with a finish date set for March 1968. The new expansion added of new retail space to the shopping center, including the new two-level JCPenney store and a Skaggs Drug Centers store. Following the opening of the new Karcher Mall store, JCPenney shuttered four nearby stores in downtown Nampa, Caldwell, Emmett, and Payette. The mall was expanded even more in August 1973, adding two more department stores, including Boise, Idaho-based Falk's I.D. Store and Seattle, Washington-based The Bon March√©, and a two-screen theater, Karcher Twin Theaters. A free-standing Ernst hardware store was added in late 1976. In 1986, Karcher Mall featured 74 businesses when it was sold from Daum Industries to Los Angeles-based Standard Management Co. for about $14 million. During the same year, Falk's I.D. Store shut its remaining 55 stores. Falk's I.D. Store sold two locations, including the store at the mall, to Anthony's. In 1987, the mall underwent a $1 million renovation. =Decline= In October 1988, Boise Towne Square opened in nearby Boise. Karcher Mall lost its biggest retailer, when JCPenney store closed its 20-year-old location to relocate to the new mall. The mall was able to quickly fill the vacant space with a Troutman's Emporium store occupying the lower level, with the upper level being used for warehouse space. Meanwhile, Sears relocated its aging Caldwell store to the Karcher Mall in 1990; the store only featured appliances and garden equipment. In 1993, the mall had over 70 tenants including five anchor stores, The Bon March√©, Emporium, The Hub Clothing, Sears and Woolworth. During the 1990s, the mall lost four anchor stores including PayLess Drug, Ernst (November 1996), Woolworth (July 1997), and The Hub Clothing (1998). In May 1998, Karcher Partners LLC, composed of Tarrytown, New York-based DLC Management Corp. and Dallas, Texas-based Benton Companies, bought Karcher Mall for a reported $10.9 million. In 1999, Karcher Partners LLC announced a $10 million renovation of the Karcher Mall that was started in September of that year. The face lift of the declining shopping center included new storefronts, new flooring and lighting, and a new main entrance. Initial plans for the renovation included adding a new anchor store into the upper level of Emporium, which had been used for warehouse space, and a food court; however, neither of these occurred. During this period, the mall added Jo-Ann Fabrics & Crafts, Intermountain Sports, and Liquidation World to fill the empty spaces left by PayLess Drug, Woolworth, and Ernst, respectively. Despite the major renovations, the mall began losing more retailers and customers. The mall's movie theater was shut down in February 2000 after its owner, Reel Theatres, relocated to a larger movie theater across the street previously operated by Cineplex Odeon. Short-lived anchor, Intermountain Sports left the mall abruptly in 2001, though it was quickly replaced by variety retailer U.S. Factory Outlets by the end of the year. Just one month after losing Intermountain Sports, Sears relocated to a newly constructed shopping center north of the Karcher Mall. In 2003, Emporium, the mall largest tenant, was forced to close after its parent company, the Troutman Company, couldn't secure a new financing package or sell the stores after a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2002. Costco Wholesale, Home Depot, and other big-box chains expressed interest in space at the mall but were turned down as the chains had \\"unrealistic expectations as to what they could do with the mall.\\" Shortly after Emporium's closure, Big 5 Sporting Goods and Ross Dress for Less were added to the mall, but neither store included interior mall entrances. In March 2004, the mall had of empty retail space according to a real estate report released by Gunstream Commercial Real Estate. =New owners; 2007 renovation= In 2004, Karcher Mall was sold to LB Nampa Mall Holdings LLC. The new owners hired Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services firm with offices in Chicago, to manage the mall and help attract new retailers to fill the mall's many vacant stores. In 2005, the mall was sold once more to Chicago-based Baum Bros. LLC and again two months later to Anaheim, California-based Milan Properties LLC. Milan Properties announced plans to remodel the 40-year-old mall and fill the long-vacant Emporium anchor with a new department store. Milan Properties also hoped that the new Interstate 84 Interchange and the new nearby Treasure Valley Marketplace would help bring more traffic to the mall. In 2007, Burlington Coat Factory, filling the former Emporium space, was the first new major retailer added to the newly renovated mall. In early 2008, clothing retailer Steve & Barry's replaced the former U.S. Factory Outlets store, which closed in 2005; however, 11 months later the store was closed when Steve & Barry's liquidated. During 2008, Macy's, which previously operated as The Bon March√© until 2003 and Bon-Macy's until 2005, announced plans to shutter its Karcher Mall location to relocate to the newly constructed Nampa Gateway Center in late 2009. The new Macy's at the Nampa Gateway Center opened on October 17. In September 2009, Northern Light Cinema Grill, an independently owned movie theater and restaurant, opened in the long-vacant Nampa Reel Theatres building. In July 2014, Macy's announced the closure of the mall's clearance center. In Spring 2016, Karcher Mall announced the opening of the new Mor Furniture store, filling the former Macy's space. Mor Furniture opened on June 16, 2016. In 2018, Burlington announced the closure of the mall's location to relocate to nearby Treasure Valley Crossing in late 2018. =2019 renovation= In May 2019, the mall was sold to Livermore, California-based Rhino Investments. In July 2019, plans were unveiled for a renovation project that include the demolition of of the mall's floor area. Several new tenants will be added to the shopping center as well as nine residential buildings with 216 apartments. Several mall tenants, including anchor stores Big 5 Sporting Goods, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Mor Furniture, and Ross, will remain part of the shopping center after demolition is completed. Construction for revamped shopping center, renamed Karcher Marketplace, began in November 2019.

Historically, Javakheti borders in the west to the Kura River (Mtkvari), and in the north, south and east with the Shavsheti, Samsari and Nialiskuri mountains. Principal economic activities in this region are subsistence agriculture, particularly potatoes, and raising livestock. In 1995, the Akhalkalaki and Ninotsminda districts, comprising the historical territory of Javakheti, was merged with the neighboring land of Samtskhe to form a new administrative region, Samtskhe-Javakheti. Armenians comprise the majority of Javakheti's population. According to the 2014 Georgian census, 93% (41,870) of the inhabitants in Akhalkalaki Municipality and 95% (23,262) in Ninotsminda Municipality were Armenians. Etymology In terminology, the name Javakheti is taken from javakh core with traditional Georgian -eti suffix; commonly, Javakheti means the home of Javakhs (an ethnic subgroup of Georgians), as for example, the word Ossetia is taken from Georgian Osi plus -eti. The -k suffix in Armenian has an identical meaning. The earliest mention of the name was found in Urartu sources, in the notes of king Argishti I of Urartu, 785 BC, as Zabaha.  History  =Antiquity= The ancient tribes of Meskhi (or Moschi) and Mosiniks are the first known inhabitants of the area. In the sources, the region was recorded as Zabakha in 785 BC, by the king Argishti I of Urartu and, probably, meaning one of the ethnic groups of Urartu. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Javakheti, together with Erusheti, was part of the Iberian duchy of Tsunda from the 4th or 3rd century BC. Since 2nd century BC to 5th century AD this region was a part of an Armenian province - Gugark, in Greater Armenia. Saint Nino entered Iberia from Javakheti, one of the southern provinces of Iberia, and, following the course of the River Kura, she arrived in Mtskheta, the capital of the kingdom, once there, she eventually began to preach Christianity, which culminated by Christianization of Iberia. One of the earliest Armenian sources, Faustus of Byzantium (the 5th century) writes: ‚ÄúMaskut King Sanesan, extremely angry, was filled with hate for his tribesman, Armenian King Khosrow, and gathered all of his troops‚ÄîHuns, Pokhs, Tavaspars, Khechmataks, Izhmakhs, Gats, Gluars, Gugars, Shichbs, Chilbs, Balasich, and Egersvans, as well as an uncountable number of other diverse nomadic tribes, all the numerous troops he commanded. He crossed his border, the great River Kura, and invaded the Armenian country.‚Äù In the 5th century during the rule of Vakhtang I of Iberia Javakheti was a province of Iberia and after his death his second wife the Byzantine princess settled in Tsunda (part of Javakheti). = Middle Ages = In the struggle against the Arab occupation, Bagrationi dynasty came to rule over Tao-Klarjeti and established the Kouropalatate of Iberia. Rulers of Tao-Klarjeti fought the Arabs from this region, and gradually incorporated surrounding lands of Samtskhe and Javakheti, along with a few other lands, into its territory. 10th century Armenian historian, Ukhtanes, wrote about the family tree of Kyrion, the Catholicos of Iberia. The literal translation of this text is as follows: Kyrion ‚Äúcame from the Iberians in terms of country and lineage, from the region of the Javakhs.‚Äù There can be no doubt that Ukhtanes believed Javakheti to be part of Iberia, and the Javakhs to be Iberians . Z. Aleksidze examines the viewpoint of this historian and the enlightened Armenian society of the 10th century on the problem that interests us in depth.http://www.ca-c.org/c-g/2011/journal_eng/c-g-1-2/13.shtml#nazad43 Between 9th-11th centuries part of Javakheti/Javakhk was ruled by Bagratid Armenia. In the mid-10th century, part of Javakheti was incorporated into Kingdom of Abkhazia. In 964 Leon III of Abkhazia extended his influence to Javakheti, and during his reign the Kumurdo Cathedral was built. In subsequent centuries, Javakheti remained in the hands of the unified Georgian monarchy and had a period of significant development, during which numerous bridges, churches, monasteries, and royal residences (Lgivi, Ghrtila, Bozhano, Vardzia, etc.) were built. In 1064 the Seljuk Turks conquered the area and ruled over the area until 1118 when the David the Builder liberated the area from the Turks. It then became part of the Principality of Armenia ruled by the Zakarian family, as a vassal state of the Kingdom of Georgia. In 1245, Javakhketi came under the control of the Toreli feudal family. In 1268, Javakheti was annexed by the principality of Samtskhe-Saatabago, ruled by the House of Jaqeli. In the 1587, the region, along with the entirety of the Principality, was occupied by the Ottoman Empire becoming the Childir Eyalet. The area's population was devastated by the Turco-Mongol incursions. In 1484, Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan of the Aq Qoyunlu devastated the principality. Islam began to spread in the area among both Georgians and Armenians. As the Georgian Church began to lose influence in the area, many Chalcedonian Armenians began to join the Armenian Catholic Church. The Islamized locals began to mix with the Turkic settlers, forming the Meskhetian Turk identity, that became dominant to the west of Javakheti in Meskheti. In 1731 Nader Shah of Afsharid Iran launched an incursion into the Caucasus and during this time enslaved 6,000 Armenians from the Childir Eyalet according to Armenian Catholicos Abraham Kretatsi. =Russian Empire= Armenian migration in the Russian Empire resulting in the Armenian population of Javakhetia In the first third of the 19th century, following the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828, Russia conquered the Southern Caucasus, and most of Georgia, along with the rest of the Caucasus, was incorporated within the Russian Empire. When the Russians conquered Javakheti it was home to 1,716 Armenians (67.7%), 639 Muslim (25.2%), and 179 Georgian families (7.1%). Many of the Muslim families chose to resettle in the Ottoman Empire following the Russian annexation of the region. The Tsarist government initiated a plan to resettle its new frontier with Iran and Turkey with Armenians who they deemed to be loyal. In total some 90,000 Armenians from the Ottoman Empire and 40,000 Armenians from Qajar Iran resettled in the Russian Caucasus, primarily the Armenian Oblast. In 1829 some 7,300 Armenian families (58,000 people) resettled in Meskheti, Javakheti, and Trialeti.Migration of Armenians (Russian). Armenians moving to Trialeti were joined by Turkish-speaking Caucasus Greeks known as Urums. Armenians moving to Javakheti were joined by a number of Doukhobors, a spiritual Christian sect from Russia. In the early 20th century, a large number of Armenian refugees from the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and Doukhobor sect members of Russian Empire, settled the region. An 1886 report found 63,799 people living in Javakheti, of which 46,384 were Armenians (72.7%), 6,674 Russians (10.5%), 6,091 Turks (9.5%), and 3,741 Georgians (5.9%). The Russian Empire Census of 1897 found 72,709 people in Javakheti, of which 52,539 were Armenians (72.3%), 6,868 were Turks (9.4%), 6,448 were Georgians, and 5,155 were Russians (7.1%). =Soviet era= Georgia came fully under Soviet control in 1921, and Javakheti, along with other former Georgian territories, became part of the Georgian SSR. The remaining Muslim minority in Javakheti, also known as \\"Meskhetian Turks\\", were deported to Uzbekistan in 1944 during the regime of Stalin. =Republic of Georgia= Currently Armenians form the ethnic majority in the region. Since independence many Doukhobor have left for Russia. Current situation An expected improvement is the planned construction of the highway (financed by the US Millennium Challenge Account) to more effectively link the region with the rest of Georgia. Also, a railroad is planned to run from Kars, Turkey to Baku, Azerbaijan via the area (see: Kars Baku Tbilisi railway line), but the Armenian population of Javakheti are opposed to this rail link because it excludes and isolates Armenia. There is already another railroad linking Armenia, Georgia and Turkey, which is the Kars-Gyumri-Akhalkalaki railroad line. The existing line is in working condition and could be operational within weeks, but due to the Turkish blockade of Armenia since 1993, the railroad is not operational.

The 3-Litre was fitted with a higher displacement 2.9 L 140 bhp version of the twin overhead camshaft Lagonda Straight-6 engine designed by Walter Owen Bentley. Like its predecessor, the 3-Litre was available as a 4-seat 2-door coup√©, built by David Brown subsidiary engineering company Tickford or as a drophead coup√© produced by the same coach builders. A 4-door saloon was introduced in 1954 and the 2-door coup√© was discontinued in 1956. In early 1955, the Mark II version introduced a floor- mounted gear lever. The car had a separate cruciform braced chassis and the suspension was independent all round, unusual for a car of its time, but utilising this form the previous 2.6 litre car, with the addition of a Jackall system. At the front there were coil springs and at the rear torsion bars and a swing axle. The Lockheed drum brakes, at the front and at the rear were servo assisted and steering was by a rack and pinion system with fore and aft adjustment on the steering column. The interior was luxurious with polished walnut for the dashboard and door trims and leather seats, individual in the front and a bench at the rear with a central fold down arm rest. There were also adjustable arm rests on the front doors. A heater, radio and built in hydraulic jacks were standard equipment. Single or two tone paint schemes were available. The 3-Litre was more expensive than its competitors and a total of just 270 of the three bodystyles were sold.

The Double H High Adventure Base was located at the Torstenson Family Wildlife Center, formerly known as the Double H Ranch. The Double H was made possible through a partnership with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the Boy Scouts of America. In 2008, the Boy Scouts of America announced that the Double H High Adventure Base would conclude six years of operation with the 2009 season, no reservations would be accepted for the 2010 season. Double H was designed to provide crews with a unique and rugged high adventure back-packing experience. Crews arriving at Double H base camp are teamed up with a wilderness guide; this guide will spend the entire trek with the crew, providing training and program. Crews were given opportunities to hike through canyons, navigate cross-country using a map and compass. Scouts will also get the opportunity to use a GPS device while Geocaching. Base camp was located at over 7,000 feet. Significant elevation changes occur as crews hike through the open ponderosa forest and participate in the program. In addition to ponderosa forests, participants had the opportunity to see many varieties of cacti, pinon trees, juniper trees and elk. Itinerary On the morning of their first day, participating crews arrive at the Double H and go through base camp where they receive their crew gear and food. Crews also receive an orientation from their wilderness guide and then head to the backcountry that afternoon. On their fourth day, crews arrive at the Martin Camp where they are given the opportunity to resupply and participate in a western dinner. Each crew has a chance to shoot inline black powder rifles, try their hand at a 3-D archery course, and participate in Search and Rescue training. From the second to third day and from the fifth to sixth day, crews explore the Double H. With no established trail system, and no naturally occurring surface water, the Double H is considered by many to be a true rugged, southwestern experience. Along the way, the wilderness guide provides program for the members of the crew. This program includes challenge course, Leave No Trace, astronomy, geocaching, search and rescue and a conservation project.

It is part of the Hiawatha National Forest. Located on Grand Island, Michigan offshore from Munising, Michigan, the Grand Island National Recreation Area covers approximately of Lake Superior woodland. Grand Island's glacier-cut lake shoreline measures approximately in length. The island's maximum dimension is from north to south. Grand Island was elevated to the status of a National Recreation Area by the U.S. Congress in 1990 after the U.S. Forest Service purchased the island from its former owner, Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co. Lake Superior Lake Superior dominates the Grand Island biotic environment. Even in high summer, the lake's temperature rarely rises above . Geology Grand Island's geology is an extension of the sandstone strata of the adjacent Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Island sandstone cliffs as tall as in height plunge down into the lake. A perimeter trail skirts much of the island's shoreline. History Native Americans quickly found the fisheries around Grand Island to be a resource for seasonal and year-round living. Artifacts from as early as 3300 years before the present (1300 BC) have been found. Tourism Grand Island National Recreation Area is served during summer months by a tourist ferry and island tour bus. The ferry ride, which is less than long, shuttles between a dock on M-28, northwest of Munising, and Grand Island's Williams Landing. Ticket fees and an admission fee to the island are charged. During the summer months, the ferry makes several trips to the island each day. The Grand Island East Channel Light in 2007 A small portion of Grand Island, the Thumb, remained privately owned as of 2012. The Thumb contains the historic 1868 Grand Island East Channel Light or 'East Channel Light', on the eastern ship channel from Lake Superior into the port of Munising. The lighthouse remained in operation until 1913. The privately owned lighthouse can be viewed from Sand Point on the mainland, within the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, or may be viewed from the water. Recreational opportunities The U.S. Forest Services recommends that visitors enjoy camping, fishing, hiking, hunting, mountain biking, and trapping on Grand Island, subject to state license laws. There are 17 campsites within the Grand Island NRA. The largest animal with a breeding presence on the island is the black bear, from which campers must protect themselves. Mountain biking is banned in most of the Thumb. Rockclimbing is strongly discouraged because the island's dramatic sandstone cliffs are friable and crumbly. The Grand Island Trail Marathon has been held every July since 2005. The event also features a 10K race.

She was renamed Amphitrite in 1869 and was decommissioned again in 1872. The monitor was sold for scrap the following year. The Navy Department evaded the Congressional refusal to order new ships by claiming that the Civil War- era ship was being repaired while building a new monitor of the same name.

Completed too late for service in the war, Tonawanda was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 22 December. She was reactivated on 23 October 1866 to serve as a training ship at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The ship was renamed Amphitrite on 15 June 1869 and she was decommissioned in 1872. By this time her wooden hull was rotting and she was sold for scrap in 1873 to Harlan and Hollingsworth Co. of Wilmington, Delaware. Although Congress was informed by the Navy Department that the Civil War-era ship was being repaired, a new iron-hulled monitor of the same name was built with repair money and the proceeds of her sale because Congress refused to fund any new construction at this time.

He made his thirteenth and final appearance for Amiens on 12 April 2003, playing the first 50 minutes of the 0‚Äì0 draw against Gueugnon before being substituted. In August 2003 he joined Sheffield Wednesday, initially on loan before signing permanently four months later for a fee of ¬£50,000. In 35 league appearances, 11 as a substitute, he scored 10 goals, making him the club's top goalscorer in the 2003‚Äì04 season.

Draft can also be referred to as the difference in pressure in the combustion chamber area which results in the motion of the flue gases and the air flow. Types of draft Drafts are produced by the rising combustion gases in the stack, flue, or by mechanical means. For example, a blower can be put into four categories: natural, induced, balanced, and forced. *Natural draft: When air or flue gases flow due to the difference in density of the hot flue gases and cooler ambient gases. The difference in density creates a pressure differential that moves the hotter flue gases into the cooler surroundings. * Forced draft: When air or flue gases are maintained above atmospheric pressure. Normally it is done with the help of a forced draft fan. * Induced draft: When air or flue gases flow under the effect of a gradually decreasing pressure below atmospheric pressure. In this case, the system is said to operate under induced draft. The stacks (or chimneys) provide sufficient natural draft to meet the low draft loss needs. In order to meet higher pressure differentials, the stacks must simultaneously operate with draft fans. *Balanced draft: When the static pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, the system is referred to as balanced draft. Draft is said to be zero in this system. Importance/significance For the proper and the optimized heat transfer from the flue gases to the boiler tubes draft holds a relatively high amount of significance. The combustion rate of the flue gases and the amount of heat transfer to the boiler are both dependent on the movement and motion of the flue gases. A boiler equipped with a combustion chamber which has a strong current of air (draft) through the fuel bed will increase the rate of combustion (which is the efficient utilization of fuel with minimum waste of unused fuel). The stronger movement will also increase the heat transfer rate from the flue gases to the boiler (which improves efficiency and circulation). Drafting in steam locomotives Since the stack of a locomotive is too short to provide natural draft, during normal running forced draft is achieved by directing the exhaust steam from the cylinders through a cone (‚Äúblast pipe‚Äù) upwards and into a skirt at the bottom of the stack. When the locomotive is stationary or in a restricted space ‚Äúlive‚Äù steam from the boiler is directed through an annular ring surrounding the blast pipe to produce the same effect.

Completed in 1963, it carries Louisiana Highway 70 (LA 70), which connects Donaldsonville on the west bank of Ascension Parish with Sorrento on the east bank of Ascension Parish as well as with Gonzales on the east bank of Ascension Parish. The approach roads on the east and west banks begin in Ascension Parish before crossing into St. James Parish. The bridge is a convenient river crossing for residents of Baton Rouge, Hammond, and the Florida Parishes to travel to the Bayou cities of Houma and Thibodaux as well as vice versa. The bridge plays an important role in storm evacuation and in industrial development along the Mississippi. From its opening in 1964 through August 15, 2001, a 50-cent toll was collected on traffic crossing to the west bank. The toll was discontinued by an act of the Louisiana Legislature, authored by Louisiana State Representative Roy Quezaire (D-Donaldsonville), whose district includes the bridge. Bridges to Nowhere The bridge gained national attention in 2008 when it became part of the Bridge to Nowhere controversy which arose during the US Presidential Election. Focused primarily on the Alaskan Governor/Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin's efforts to secure federal funding for the Gravina Island Bridge, the Sunshine Bridge was placed into the same category. While the only bridge across the Mississippi between New Orleans and Baton Rouge when it opened for traffic in 1964, its south end then emptied into a swamp, and for years it awaited funding to connect it to LA 70 and other roads. When this occurred, the economy in this area grew by leaps and bounds, largely due to the improved transportation. Much of the criticism involved residual resentment from the bridge being named to recognize Governor Jimmie Davis. Built under his administration, Davis had twice picked and sung his way into the Governor's Mansion with hits like \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" and whose horse, which he rode into the Governor's office at his second inaugural, was also named Sunshine. 2018 Barge collision and closure On the morning of October 12, 2018, a crane being transported on a barge operated by Marquette Transportation collided with The Sunshine Bridge. The crane was reportedly being transported while its boom was still in an upright position. Due to extensive damage done to a main load carrying span, the Sunshine Bridge was immediately closed to all vehicle traffic for emergency repairs. These repairs were expected to be completed in late January or early February 2019. The eastbound lanes are projected to reopen in April, and the bridge is planned to be fully reopened in August. The loss of this Mississippi River crossing means that traffic must take a significant detour to either the Gramercy Bridge or the Horace Wilkinson Bridge, a detour that is at least in length. Extensive signage warning motorists of the bridge closure well in advance has been erected on each side, including detour signs at the interchange of Interstate 10 and LA 22, which connects to LA 70 some north of the bridge.

The total population (sum of all the millets) was given at 20,975,345, and the Greek population was given at 1,792,206. The 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey (, ) stemmed from the \\"Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations\\" signed at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 30 January 1923, by the governments of Greece and Turkey. It involved at least 1.6 million people (1,221,489 Greek Orthodox from Asia Minor, Eastern Thrace, the Pontic Alps and the Caucasus, and 355,000‚Äì400,000 Muslims from Greece), most of whom were forcibly made refugees and de jure denaturalized from their homelands. The initial request for an exchange of population came from Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, as it was a plan he had come up with before WWI. In a letter he submitted to the League of Nations on October 16, 1922, Venizelos proposed a \\"compulsory exchange of Greek and Turkish populations,\\" and asked Fridtjof Nansen to make the necessary arrangements. The new state of Turkey also envisioned the population exchange as a way to formalize and make permanent the flight of its native Greek Orthodox peoples following their genocide (1914‚Äì1922), while initiating a new exodus of a smaller number (400,000) of Muslims from Greece as a way to provide settlers for the newly-depopulated Orthodox villages of Turkey; Greece meanwhile saw it as a way to provide propertyless Greek Orthodox refugees from Turkey with lands of expelled Muslims. This major compulsory population exchange, or agreed mutual expulsion, was based not on language or ethnicity, but upon religious identity, and involved nearly all the indigenous Orthodox Christian citizens of Turkey (the R√ªm \\"Roman/Byzantine\\" millet), including even Turkish-speaking Orthodox citizens, and on the other side most of the native Muslims of Greece, including even Greek-speaking Muslim citizens, such as Cretan Turks. Each group were citizens, and mostly native peoples, of the state which expelled them, and neither had representation in the state purporting to speak for them in the exchange treaty. Estimated numbers By the end of 1922, the vast majority of native Asia Minor Greeks had fled the new state of Turkey due to defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922). According to some calculations, during the autumn of 1922, around 900,000 Greeks arrived in Greece.Nikolaos Andriotis (2008).

The estimate for the Greeks living within the present day borders of Turkey in 1914 could be as high as 2.130 million a figure higher than the 1.8 million Greeks in the Ottoman census of 1910 which included Western Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus based on the number of Greeks who left for Greece just before World War I and the number, 1.3. million who arrived in the population exchanges of 1923, and massacred, estimated to between 300-900,000. A revised count suggests 620,000 in Eastern Thrace including Constantinople (260,000, 30% of the city's population), 550,000 Pontic Greeks, 900,000 Anatolian Greeks and 60,000 Cappadocian Greeks. Arrivals in Greece from the exchange numbered 1,310,000 according to the map (in this article) with figures below: 260,000 from Eastern Thrace (100,000 had already left between 1912‚Äì1914 after the Balkan Wars), 20,000 from the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara, 650,000 from Anatolia, 60,000 from Cappadocia, 280,000 Pontic Greeks, 40,000 left Constantinople (the Greeks there were permitted to stay, but those who had fled during the war were not allowed to return). Additionally 50,000 Greeks came from the Caucasus, 50,000 from Bulgaria and 12,000 from Crimea, almost 1.42 million from all regions. 340,000 Greeks remained in Turkey, 220,000 of them in Istanbul in 1924. The most often given figure for Ottoman Greeks killed from 1914 to 1923 ranges from 300,000-900,000. For the whole of the period between 1914 and 1922 and for the whole of Anatolia, there are academic estimates of death toll ranging from 289,000 to 750,000. The figure of 750,000 is suggested by political scientist Adam Jones. Scholar Rudolph Rummel compiled various figures from several studies to estimate lower and higher bounds for the death toll between 1914 and 1923. He estimates that 384,000 Greeks were exterminated from 1914 to 1918, and 264,000 from 1920 to 1922. The total number reaching 648,000. Table 5.1B.

The prewar Greek population may have been closer to 2.4 million. The number of Armenians killed varies from a low of 300,000 to 1.5 million.

The estimate for Assyrians is 275‚Äì300,000.Estimates on the overall death toll have varied. Providing detailed statistics of the various estimates of the Churches' population after the genocide, David Gaunt accepts the figure of 275,000 deaths as reported by the Assyrian delegation at the Treaty of Lausanne and ventures that the death toll would be around 300,000 because of uncounted Assyrian-inhabited areas.name=\\"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\\">David Gaunt, \\"The Assyrian Genocide of 1915\\", Assyrian Genocide Research Center, 2009 Rudolph Rummel gives the number of Christian deaths in Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey as 102,000 and adds to this the killing of around 47,000 Assyrians in Persia By 1924 the Christian population of Turkey proper had been reduced from 4.4 million in 1912 to 700,000 (50% of the pre-war Christians had been killed), 350,000 Armenians, 50,000 Assyrians and the rest Greeks, 70% in Constantinople; and by 1927 to 350,000, mostly in Istanbul.

This was due to events that had a significant impact on the country's demographic structure, such as the First World War, the genocide of Syriacs, Assyrian, Greeks, Armenians, and Chaldeans the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Historical background The Greek‚ÄìTurkish population exchange came out of the Turkish military's reaction against Christian minorities in the late days of the Ottoman Empire and its subsequent massacres of them: Adana massacre of 1909, Armenian Genocide of 1914‚Äì1923, and Greek genocide 1914‚Äì1922. By January 31, 1917, the Chancellor of Germany, allied with the Ottomans during World War I, was reporting that: Demotic Greek speakers in yellow, Pontic Greek in orange and Cappadocian Greek in green with individual villages indicated.Dawkins, R.M. 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. At the end of World War I one of the Ottomans' foremost generals, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, continued the fight against the attempted Allied occupation of Turkey in the Turkish War of Independence. The surviving Christian minorities within Turkey, particularly the Armenians and the Greeks, had sought protection from the Allies and thus continued to be seen as an internal problem, and as an enemy, by the Turkish National Movement. This was exacerbated by the Allies authorizing Greece to occupy Ottoman regions (Occupation of Smyrna) with a large surviving Greek minority population in 1919 and by an Allied proposal to protect the remaining Armenians by creating an independent state for them (Wilsonian Armenia) within the former Ottoman realm. The Turkish Nationalists' reaction to these events led directly to the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) and the continuation of the Armenian Genocide and Greek genocide. After Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's capture of Smyrna followed by the abolition of the Ottoman Empire on November 1, 1922, over a million Greek orthodox Ottoman subjects had fled their homes in Turkey. A formal peace agreement was signed with Greece after months of negotiations in Lausanne on July 24, 1923. Two weeks after the treaty, the Allied Powers turned over Istanbul to the Nationalists, marking the final departure of occupation armies from Anatolia and provoking another flight of Christian minorities to Greece. On October 29, 1923, the Grand Turkish National Assembly announced the creation of the Republic of Turkey, a state that would encompass most of the territories claimed by Mustafa Kemal in his National Pact of 1920. The state of Turkey was headed by Mustafa Kemal's People's Party, which later became the Republican People's Party. The end of the War of Independence brought new administration to the region, but also brought new problems considering the demographic reconstruction of cities and towns, many of which had been abandoned by fleeing minority Christians. The Greco-Turkish War left many of the settlements plundered and in ruins. Meanwhile, after the Balkan Wars, Greece had almost doubled its territory, and the population of the state had risen from approximately 3.7 million to 4.8 million. With this newly annexed population, the proportion of non-Greek minority groups in Greece rose to 13%, and following the end of the First World War, it had increased to 20%. Most of the ethnic populations in these annexed territories were Muslim, but were not necessarily Turkish in ethnicity. This is particularly true in the case of ethnic Albanians who inhabited the √áam√´ria (Greek: Œ§œÉŒ±ŒºŒøœÖœÅŒπŒ¨) region of Epirus. During the deliberations held at Lausanne, the question of exactly who was Greek, Turkish or Albanian was routinely brought up. Greek and Albanian representatives determined that the Albanians in Greece, who mostly lived in the northwestern part of the state, were not all mixed, and were distinguishable from the Turks. The government in Ankara still expected a thousand \\"Turkish-speakers\\" from the √áam√´ria to arrive in Anatolia for settlement in Erdek, Ayvalƒ±k, Mente≈üe, Antalya, Senkile, Mersin, and Adana. Ultimately, the Greek authorities decided to deport thousands of Muslims from Thesprotia, Larissa, Langadas, Drama, Vodina, Serres, Edessa, Florina, Kilkis, Kavala, and Salonika. Between 1923 and 1930, the infusion of these refugees into Turkey would dramatically alter Anatolian society. By 1927, Turkish officials had settled 32,315 individuals from Greece in the province of Bursa alone. The road to the exchange Kayak√∂y (Livisi), in southwestern Anatolia, once a Greek-inhabited settlement, was turned into a ghost town after the population exchange. According to local tradition, Muslims refused to repopulate the place because \\"it was infested with the ghosts of Livisians massacred in 1915\\". According to some sources, the population exchange, albeit messy and dangerous for many, was executed fairly quickly by respected supervisors. If the goal of the exchange was to achieve ethnic-national homogeneity, then this was achieved by both Turkey and Greece. For example, in 1906, nearly 20 percent of the population of present-day Turkey was non-Muslim, but by 1927, only 2.6 percent was. The architect of the exchange was Fridtjof Nansen, commissioned by the League of Nations. As the first official high commissioner for refugees, Nansen proposed and supervised the exchange, taking into account the interests of Greece, Turkey, and West European powers. As an experienced diplomat with experience resettling Russian and other refugees after the First World War, Nansen had also created a new travel document for displaced persons of the World War in the process. He was chosen to be in charge of the peaceful resolution of the Greek-Turkish war of 1919‚Äì22. Although a compulsory exchange on this scale had never been attempted in modern history, Balkan precedents, such as the Greco-Bulgarian population exchange of 1919, were available. Because of the unanimous decision by the Greek and Turkish governments that minority protection would not suffice to ameliorate ethnic tensions after the First World War, population exchange was promoted as the only viable option. According to representatives from Ankara, the \\"amelioration of the lot of the minorities in Turkey' depended 'above all on the exclusion of every kind of foreign intervention and of the possibility of provocation coming from outside'. This could be achieved most effectively with an exchange, and 'the best guarantees for the security and development of the minorities remaining' after the exchange 'would be those supplied both by the laws of the country and by the liberal policy of Turkey with regard to all communities whose members have not deviated from their duty as Turkish citizens'. An exchange would also be useful as a response to violence in the Balkans; 'there were', in any event, 'over a million Turks without food or shelter in countries in which neither Europe nor America took nor was willing to take any interest'. The population exchange was seen as the best form of minority protection as well as \\"the most radical and humane remedy\\" of all. Nansen believed that what was on the negotiating table at Lausanne was not ethno-nationalism, but rather, a \\"question\\" that \\"demanded 'quick and efficient' resolution without a minimum of delay.\\" He believed that economic component of the problem of Greek and Turkish refugees deserved the most attention: \\"Such an exchange will provide Turkey immediately and in the best conditions with the population necessary to continue the exploitation of the cultivated lands which the departed Greek populations have abandoned. The departure from Greece of its Moslem citizens would create the possibility of rendering self-supporting a great proportion of the refugees now concentrated in the towns and in different parts of Greece\\". Nansen recognized that the difficulties were truly \\"immense\\", acknowledging that the population-exchange would require \\"the displacement of populations of many more than 1,000,000 people\\". He advocated: \\"uprooting these people from their homes, transferring them to a strange new country, ... registering, valuing and liquidating their individual property which they abandon, and ... securing to them the payment of their just claims to the value of this property\\". The agreement promised that the possessions of the refugees would be protected and allowed migrants to carry \\"portable\\" belongings freely with themselves. It was required that possessions not carried across the Aegean sea be recorded in lists; these lists were to be submitted to both governments for reimbursement. After a commission was established to deal with the particular issue of belongings (mobile and immobile) of the populations, this commission would decide the total sum to pay persons for their immovable belongings (houses, cars, land, etc.) It was also promised that in their new settlement, the refugees would be provided with new possessions totaling the ones they had left behind. Greece and Turkey would calculate the total value of a refugee's belongings and the country with a surplus would pay the difference to the other country. All possessions left in Greece belonged to the Greek state and all the possessions left in Turkey belonged to the Turkish state. Because of the difference in nature and numbers of the populations, the possessions left behind by the Greek elite of the economic classes in Anatolia was greater than the possessions of the Muslim farmers in Greece. Norman M. Naimark claimed that this treaty was the last part of an ethnic cleansing campaign to create an ethnically pure homeland for the Turks.Naimark, Norman M (2002), Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe, Harvard University Press. p. 47. Historian Dinah Shelton similarly wrote that \\"the Lausanne Treaty completed the forcible transfer of the country's Greeks.\\"Dinah, Shelton. Encyclopaedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, p. 303. Refugee camps Greek and Armenian refugee children in Athens Muslim refugees The Refugee Commission had no useful plan to follow to resettle the refugees. Having arrived in Greece for the purpose of settling the refugees on land, the Commission had no statistical data either about the number of the refugees or the number of available acres. When the Commission arrived in Greece, the Greek government had already settled provisionally 72,581 farming families, almost entirely in Macedonia, where the houses abandoned by the exchanged Moslems, and the fertility of the land made their establishment practicable and auspicious. In Turkey, the property abandoned by the Greeks was often looted by arriving immigrants before the influx of immigrants of the population exchange. As a result, it was quite difficult to settle refugees in Anatolia since many of these homes had been occupied by people displaced by war before the government could seize them. Political and economic effects of the exchange The more than 1,250,000 refugees who left Turkey for Greece after the war in 1922, through different mechanisms, contributed to the unification of elites under authoritarian regimes in Turkey and Greece. In Turkey, the departure of the independent and strong economic elites, e.g. the Greek Orthodox populations, left the dominant state elites unchallenged. In fact, Caglar Keyder noted that \\"what this drastic measure [Greek-Turkish population exchange] indicates is that during the war years Turkey lost ... [around 90 percent of the pre-war] commercial class, such that when the Republic was formed, the bureaucracy found itself unchallenged\\".The emerging business groups that supported the Free Republican Party in 1930 could not prolong the rule of a single-party without an opposition. Transition to multiparty politics depended on the creation of stronger economic groups in the mid-1940s, which was stifled due to the exodus of the Greek middle and upper economic classes. Hence, if the groups of Orthodox Christians had stayed in Turkey after the formation of the nation-state, then there would have been a faction of society ready to challenge the emergence of single-party rule in Turkey. In Greece, contrary to Turkey, the arrival of the refugees broke the dominance of the monarchy and old politicians relative to the Republicans. In the elections of the 1920s most of the newcomers supported Eleftherios Venizelos. In December 1916, during the Noemvriana, refugees from an earlier wave of persecution in the Ottoman empire had been attacked by royalist troops as Venizelists, which contributed to the perception in the 1920s that the Venizelist side of the National Schism was much friendlier to refugees from Anatolia than the royalist side.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 260 For their political stance and their \\"Anatolian customs\\" (cuisine, music, etc), the refugees often faced discrimination by part of the local Greek population. The fact that the refugees spoke dialects of Greek that sounded exotic and strange in Greece marked them out, and they were often seen as rivals by the locals for land and jobs.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 278 The arrival of so many people in so short a period of time imposed significant costs on the Greek economy such as building housing and schools, importing enough food, providing health care, etc.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 279 Greece needed a 12,000,000 franc loan from the Refugee Settlement Commission of the League of Nations as there was not enough money in the Greek treasury to handle these costs.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 279 Increasing the problems was the Immigration Act of 1924 passed by the U.S. Congress, which sharply limited the number of immigrants the United States was willing to take annually, which removed one of the traditional \\"safety valves\\" that Greece had in periods of high unemployment.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 pp. 261 & 279 In the 1920s, the refugees, most of whom went to Greek Macedonia, were known for their staunch loyalty to Venizelism.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 278 According to the 1928 census, 45% of the population in Macedonia were refugees, in Greek Thrace 35% of the population were refugees, in Athens 19% of the population were refugees, and in the islands in the Aegean Sea 18% were refugees.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 276 Overall, the census showed that 1, 221, 849 people or 20%

care system.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.261 Tensions between locals and the refugees for jobs sometimes turned violent, and in 1924, the Interior Minister, General Georgios Kondylis, used a force of refugees as strike-breakers.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 262 In rural areas, there were demands that the land that once belonged to the Muslims that had been expelled should go to veterans instead of the refugees.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 262 Demagogic politicians quite consciously stoked tensions, portraying refugees as a parasitical class who by their very existence were overwhelming public services, as a way to gain votes..Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 pp. 261‚Äì262 As the largest number of refugees were settled in Macedonia, which was part of the \\"new Greece\\" (i.e the areas gained after the Balkan Wars of 1912-13), they shared in the resentment against the way that men from \\"old Greece\\" (i.e the area that was Greece before 1912) dominated politics, the civil service, judiciary, etc, and tended to treat \\"new Greece\\" like it was a conquered country.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 pp. 273 & 277‚Äì278 In general, people from \\"old Greece\\" tended to be more royalist in their sympathies while people from \\"new Greece\\" tended to be more Venizelist.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 pp. 277‚Äì278 The fact that in 1916 King Constantine I had contemplated giving up \\"new \\"Greece\\" to Bulgaria as a way of weakening the Venizelist movement had greatly increased the hostility felt in \\"new Greece\\" towards of the House of Gl√ºcksburg.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.278 Furthermore, the fact that it was under King Constantine's leadership that Greece had been defeated in 1922 together with the indifference shown by Greek authorities in Smyrna (modern ƒ∞zmir, Turkey) towards rescuing the threatened Greek communities of Anatolia in the last stages of the war cemented the hatred of the refugees towards the monarchy.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 261 Aristeidis Stergiadis, the Greek High Commissioner in Smyrna remarked in August 1922 as the Turkish Army advanced upon the city: \\"Better that they stay here and be slain by Kemal [Ataturk], because if they go to Athens they will overthrow everything\\".Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 261 However, increasing grievances of the refugees caused some of the immigrants to shift their allegiance to the Communist Party and contributed to its increasing strength. Many of them, shifted their support to the Communist party especially after 1930, when Venizelos as Prime Minister gave up in the matter of their properties, during his rapprochement efforts with Turkey. The impoverished slum districts of Thessaloniki where the refugees were concentrated became strongholds of the Greek Communist Party in the Great Depression together with the rural areas of Macedonia where tobacco farming was the main industry.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 277 In May 1936, a strike of the tobacco farmers in Macedonia organized by the Communists led to a rebellion that saw the government lose control of Thessaloniki for a time.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 277 Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas, with the support of the King, responded to the communists by establishing an authoritarian regime in 1936, the 4th of August Regime. In these ways, the population exchange indirectly facilitated changes in the political regimes of Greece and Turkey during the interwar period. Many immigrants died of epidemic illnesses during the voyage and brutal waiting for boats for transportation. The death rate during the immigration was four times higher than the birth rate. In the first years after arrival, the immigrants from Greece were inefficient in economic production, having only brought with them agricultural skills in tobacco production. This created considerable economic loss in Anatolia for the new Turkish republic. On the other hand, the Greek populations that left were skilled workers who engaged in transnational trade and business, as per previous capitulations policies of the Ottoman Empire. Effect on other ethnic populations While current scholarship defines the Greek-Turkish population exchange in terms of religious identity, the population exchange was much more complex than this. Indeed, the population exchange, embodied in the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations at the Lausanne Conference of January 30, 1923, was based on ethnic identity. The population exchange made it legally possible for both Turkey and Greece to cleanse their ethnic minorities in the formation of the nation-state. Nonetheless, religion was utilized as a legitimizing factor or a \\"safe criterion\\" in marking ethnic groups as Turkish or as Greek in the population exchange. As a result, the Greek-Turkish population exchange did exchange the Greek Orthodox population of Anatolia, Turkey and the Muslim population of Greece. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of these former Ottoman lands, many other ethnic groups posed social and legal challenges to the terms of the agreement for years after its signing. Among these were the Protestant and Catholic Greeks, the Arabs, Albanians, Russians, Serbians, Romanians of the Greek Orthodox religion; the Albanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Greek Muslims of Epirus, and the Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox. In Thessaloniki , which was the largest Jewish city in the Balkans, competition emerged between the Sephardic Jews who spoke Ladino and the refugees for jobs and businesses.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 274 Owning to an increase in antisemitism, many of the Jews of Thessaloniki became Zionists and immigrated to the Palestine Mandate in the interwar period.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 274 Because the refugees tended to vote for the Venizelist Liberals, the Jews and remaining Muslims in Thrace and Macedonia tended to vote for the anti-Venizelist parties.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p.275 A group of refugee merchants in Thessaloniki founded the republican and anti- Semitic EEE (Ethniki Enosis Ellados-National Union of Greece) party in 1927 to press for the removal of the Jews from the city, whom they saw as economic competitors.Kostis, Kostas History's Spoiled Children, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 p. 262 However, the EEE never became a major party, through its members were collaborated with the Germans in World War II, serving in the Security Battalions.Mazower, Mark Inside Hitler's Greece, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993 p. 328 The heterogeneous nature of the groups under the nation-state of Greece and Turkey is not reflected in the establishment of criteria formed in the Lausanne negotiations. This is evident in the first article of the Convention which states: \\"As from 1st May, 1923, there shall take place a compulsory exchange of Turkish nationals of the Greek Orthodox religion established in Turkish territory, and of Greek nationals of the Moslem religion established in Greek territory.\\" The agreement defined the groups subject to exchange as Muslim and Greek Orthodox. This classification follows the lines drawn by the millet system of the Ottoman Empire. In the absence of rigid national definitions, there was no readily available criteria to yield to an official ordering of identities after centuries long coexistence in a non-national order. Displacements The impact of the population exchange on the demography of Greece The Treaty of S√®vres imposed harsh terms upon Turkey and placed most of Anatolia under de facto Allied and Greek control. Sultan Mehmet VI's acceptance of the treaty angered Turkish nationalists, who established a rival government at Ankara and reorganized Turkish forces with the aim of blocking the implementation of the treaty. By the fall of 1922, the Ankara-based government had secured most of Turkey's borders and replaced the fading Ottoman Sultanate as the dominant governing entity in Anatolia. In light of these events, a peace conference was convened at Lausanne, Switzerland, in order to draft a new treaty to replace the Treaty of S√®vres. Invitations to participate in the conference were extended to both the Ankara-based government and the Istanbul-based Ottoman government, but the abolition of the Sultanate by the Ankara-based government on 1 November 1922 and the subsequent departure of Sultan Mehmet VI from Turkey left the Ankara- based government as the sole governing entity in Anatolia. The Ankara-based government, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, moved swiftly to implement its nationalist programme, which did not allow for the presence of significant non-Turkish minorities in Western Anatolia. In one of his first diplomatic acts as the sole governing representative of Turkey, Atat√ºrk negotiated and signed the \\"Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations\\" on 30 January 1923 with Eleftherios Venizelos and the government of Greece. The convention had a retrospective effect for all the population moves which took place since the declaration of the First Balkan War, i.e. 18 October 1912 (article 3). However, by the time the agreement was to take effect, 1 May 1923, most of the pre-war Greek population of Aegean Turkey had already fled. The exchange involved the remaining Greeks of central Anatolia (both Greek- and Turkish-speaking), Pontus and Kars. Thus of the 1,200,000 only about 189,916 still remained in Turkey that time. In Greece, it was considered part of the events called the Asia Minor Catastrophe (). Significant refugee displacement and population movements had already occurred following the Balkan Wars, World War I, and the Turkish War of Independence. The convention affected the populations as follows: almost all Greek Orthodox Christians (Greek- or Turkish-speaking) of Asia Minor including the Greek Orthodox populations from middle Anatolia (Cappadocian Greeks), the Ionia region (e.g. Smyrna, Aivali), the Pontus region (e.g. Trapezunda, Sampsunta), the former Russian Caucasus province of Kars (Kars Oblast), Prusa (Bursa), the Bithynia region (e.g., Nicomedia (ƒ∞zmit), Chalcedon (Kadƒ±k√∂y), East Thrace, and other regions were either expelled or formally denaturalized from Turkish territory. On the other hand, the Muslim population in Greece not having been affected by the recent Greek-Turkish conflict was almost intact. Thus c. 354,647 Muslims moved to Turkey after the agreement. Those Muslims were predominantly Turkish, but some belonged to Greek, Roma, Pomak, Macedonian, Cham Albanian, Megleno-Romanian, and D√∂nmeh Muslim communities. For both communities, the population exchange had traumatic psychological effects. Professor Ayse Lahur Kirtunc, a Cretan Muslim expelled to Turkey stated in an interview: \\"It's late for us to be preserving our recollections; The essence of them, the first essence, has vanished already. Those first migrants took away their memories; the memories that ought to have been recorded without delay. Eighty years have passed, and the memories are warring with another, ripe for distortion. But the core of every migrant's statement remains the same. Birth in one place, growing old in another place. And feeling a stranger in the two places\\".Kaloudis, George \\"Ethnic Cleansing in Asia Minor and the Treaty of Lausanne\\" pp. 59‚Äì89 from International Journal on World Peace, Volume 31, No. 1, March 2014 p. 83 Aftermath Greek population in Istanbul and percentages of the city population (1844‚Äì1997). Pogroms and policies in Turkey led virtually to the exodus of the remaining Greek community. Kaynarca) to Thessaloniki (16 December 1927) The Turks and other Muslims of Western Thrace were exempted from this transfer as were the Greeks of Constantinople (Istanbul) and the Aegean Islands of Imbros (G√∂k√ßeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada). In the event, those Greeks who had temporarily fled these regions, particularly Istanbul, before the entrance of the Turkish army were not permitted to return to their homes by Turkey afterwards. Greece, with a population of just over 5,000,000 people, had to absorb 1,221,489 new citizens from Turkey. The punitive measures carried out by the Republic of Turkey, such as the 1932 parliamentary law which barred Greek citizens in Turkey from a series of 30 trades and professions from tailor and carpenter to medicine, law, and real estate, correlated with a reduction in the Greek population of Istanbul, and of that of Imbros and Tenedos. Most property abandoned by Greeks who were subject to the population exchange was confiscated by the Turkish government by declaring them \\"abandoned\\" and therefore state owned. Properties were confiscated arbitrarily by labeling the former owners as \\"fugitives\\" under the court of law.Metin Herer, \\"Turkey: The Political System Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow,\\" in Contemporary Turkey: Society, Economy, External Policy, ed. Thanos Veremis and Thanos Dokos (Athens: Papazisi/ELIAMEP, 2002), 17 ‚Äì 9. Additionally, real property of many Greeks was declared \\"unclaimed\\" and ownership was subsequently assumed by the state. Consequently, the greater part of the Greeks' real property was sold at nominal value by the Turkish government. Sub-committees that operated under the framework of the Committee for Abandoned properties had undertaken the verification of persons to be exchanged in order to continue the task of selling property abandoned. The Varlƒ±k Vergisi capital gains tax imposed in 1942 on wealthy non-Muslims in Turkey also served to reduce the economic potential of ethnic Greek business people in Turkey. Furthermore, violent incidents as the Istanbul Pogrom (1955) directed primarily against the ethnic Greek community, and against the Armenian and Jewish minorities, greatly accelerated emigration of Greeks, reducing the 200,000-strong Greek minority in 1924 to just over 2,500 in 2006.According to the Human Rights Watch the Greek population in Turkey is estimated at 2,500 in 2006. \\"From 'Denying Human Rights and Ethnic Identity' series of Human Rights Watch\\" Human Rights Watch, 2 July 2006. The 1955 Istanbul Pogrom caused most of the Greek inhabitants remaining in Istanbul to flee to Greece. The population profile of Crete was significantly altered as well. Greek- and Turkish-speaking Muslim inhabitants of Crete (Cretan Turks) moved, principally to the Anatolian coast, but also to Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Conversely, Greeks from Asia Minor, principally Smyrna, arrived in Crete bringing in their distinctive dialects, customs and cuisine. According to Bruce Clark, leaders of Greece and Turkey, and some circles in the international community, saw the resulting ethnic homogenization of their respective states as positive and stabilizing since it helped strengthen the nation-state natures of these two states. Nevertheless, the deportations brought significant challenges: social, such as forcibly being removed from one's place of living, and more practical such as abandoning a well-developed family business. Countries also face other practical challenges: for example, even decades after, one could notice certain hastily developed parts of Athens, residential areas that had been quickly erected on a budget while receiving the fleeing Asia Minor population. To this day, Greece and Turkey still have properties, and even villages such as Kayak√∂y, that have been left abandoned since the exchange.

Described as \\"the best-known and most performed Italian composer\\" of the present day, his works include Quaderno di strada (2003) and La porta della legge (2006‚Äì08). Biography In his youth, Salvatore Sciarrino was attracted to the visual arts, but began experimenting with music when he was twelve. Though he had some lessons from Antonino Titone and Turi Belfiore, he is primarily self-taught as a composer. After his classical studies and a few years of university in his home city, in 1969 he moved to Rome, where he attended Franco Evangelisti's course in electronic music at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia . In 1977, Sciarrino moved from Rome to Milan, where he taught at the conservatory until 1982. By this time his compositional career had expanded to the point where he could withdraw from teaching, and he moved to Citt√† di Castello, in Umbria, where he has lived ever since. He nevertheless has continued to teach occasionally in Florence and Bologna, as well as in Citt√† di Castello. Some of his notable students include Francesco Filidei, Lucia Ronchetti, David Monacchi, and Maurizio Pisati. He has composed for: Teatro alla Scala, RAI, Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Biennale di Venezia, Teatro La Fenice di Venezia, Teatro Carlo Felice di Genova, Fondazione Arena di Verona, Stuttgart State Opera, Brussels La Monnaie, Frankfurt Opera Theatre, Amsterdam Concertgebouw, London Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo Suntory Hall. He has also composed for the following festivals: Schwetzinger Festspiele, Donaueschinger Musiktage, Witten, Salzburg, New York, Wien Modern, Wiener Festwochen, Berliner Festspiele Musik, Holland Festival, Alborough, Festival d'Automne (Paris), Ultima (Oslo). His music was published by Ricordi from 1969 to 2004. Since 2005, Rai Trade has had exclusive rights for Sciarrino‚Äôs works. Sciarrino‚Äôs discography is extensive: there are over 70 CDs, many of which have won awards. Apart from being author of most of the librettos of his operas, Sciarrino has written many articles, essays and texts, some of which have been chosen and collected in Carte da suono, CIDIM ‚Äì Novecento, 2001. His book about musical form: Le figure della musica da Beethoven a oggi (Ricordi 1998) is particularly important. From 1978 to 1980, he was Artistic Director of Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Academic of Santa Cecilia (Roma), Academic of Fine Arts of Bavaria and Academic of the Arts (Berlin). He has been teaching at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana since 2013; beforehand he held the composition class in 1983 and in 2002. Sciarrino has won many awards, among the most recent are: Prince Pierre de Monaco (2003) and the prestigious Feltrinelli Prize (2003). He is also the first prizewinner of the newly created Salzburg Music Prize (2006), an International composition prize established by Salzburg. He received the 2011 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award of Contemporary Music for renewing the possibilities of vocal and instrumental music and for the singularity of his sound materials. Sciarrino has developed a new and unique syntax and a manner of combining extreme synthesis with richness of detail. Musical style Works Sciarrino's works include a large body of chamber music, including many pieces for wind instruments, five piano sonatas, and several operas or theatrical works: Da gelo a gelo, Infinito nero, Macbeth (2002), Perseo ed Andromeda, Lohengrin, and Luci mie traditrici.

Overview Roscoe Karns stars as the title character whose job is \\"chief of homicide\\" of Manhattan's 24th Police Precinct. During the first three seasons, Earl Hammond portrayed King's partner, Detective Sgt. Lane. During the final two seasons, Karns' real life son Todd portrayed King's partner Detective Hart.

The majority of DuMont shows were known for their austere budgets. This one fit in perfectly because it was broadcast live from the actual corridors and offices of DuMont. Despite its low budget and limited nationwide audience (the DuMont network owned a limited number of stations), Rocky King was DuMont's most popular and longest running shows.

It is located on the campus of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. IPAC was established in 1986 to provide support for the joint European-American orbiting infrared telescope, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, or IRAS. The IRAS mission performed an unbiased, sensitive all-sky survey at 12, 25, 60 and 100 ¬µm during 1983. After the mission ended, IPAC started the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) to make the data available to anyone who needed it. Later, NASA designated IPAC as the U.S. science support center for the European Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), which ceased operations in 1998. About that same time, IPAC was designated as the science center for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope after launch. IPAC also assumed the lead role in various other infrared space missions, including the Wide-field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) and the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX). IPAC also expanded its support to include ground-based missions with the assumption of science support responsibilities for the Two- Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), a near-infrared survey of the entire sky conducted by twin observatories in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In 1999, IPAC formed an interferometry science center, originally called the Michelson Science Center (MSC) after interferometry pioneer Albert A. Michelson. MSC was renamed the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) in 2008. Today, the greater IPAC includes the Spitzer Science Center, the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute and the NASA Herschel Science Center.

The Church of the Transfiguration is located atop Mount Tabor. It is later mentioned in the 5th century Transitus Beatae Mariae Virginis. Additionally, the highest summit on Mt.

Retitled Cugel the Clever in its Vance Integral Edition (2005), the book features the self-proclaimed Cugel the Clever in linked stories. The components of the fix-up were five short works published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction from December 1965 to July 1966, and one original to the book. Plot summary Cugel is easily persuaded by the merchant Fianosther to attempt the burglary of the manse of Iucounu the Laughing Magician. Trapped and caught, he agrees that in exchange for his freedom he will undertake the recovery of a small hemisphere of violet glass, an Eye of the Overworld, to match one already in the wizard's possession. A small sentient alien entity of barbs and hooks, named Firx, is attached to his liver to encourage his \\"unremitting loyalty, zeal and singleness of purpose,\\". Firx's only form of communication with its host is to slash his liver. Iucounu then uses a spell to transport Cugel via flying demon to the remote Land of Cutz. There, Cugel finds two villages, one occupied by wearers of the violet lenses, the other by peasants who work on behalf of the lens-wearers, in hopes of being promoted to their ranks. The lenses cause their wearers to see, not their squalid surroundings, but the Overworld, a vastly superior version of reality where a hut is a palace, gruel is a magnificent feast, etc. ‚Äî \\"seeing the world through rose-colored glasses\\" on a grand scale.

He then undertakes an arduous trek back to Iucounu, cursing the magician the entire way; this forms the principal part of the book. After many pitfalls, setbacks, and harrowing escapes, including a voyage back in time a million years, ending in the eviction of Firx from his system, and a grateful wizard speeding him by a spell back home, Cugel returns to Iucounu's manse, where he finds the wizard's volition has been captured by a twin to Firx. Cugel manages to extirpate the alien, subdue the magician, and enjoy the easy life in the manse, until he tries to banish Iucounu and Fianosther (who himself has come to pilfer from Cugel) with the same spell that the magician had used on him. But Cugel's tongue slips in uttering the incantation, and the flying demon seizes him instead, delivering him to the same spot as before. Author Michael Shea wrote an authorized sequel, A Quest for Simbilis (DAW Books, NY, 1974). Vance's own Cugel sequel was published as Cugel's Saga in 1983.  Cugel's character  Cugel is a classic Vance anti-hero; though he fancies himself an aesthete and a superior being to those around him, in his actions he is a liar, a cheat, an inveterate thief, a charlatan, selfish, greedy, vicious, and so on. However, Cugel has always lived a life of poverty and often needed these attributes for survival. With less obloquy, Vance describes him as \\"a man of many capabilities, with a disposition at once flexible and pertinacious. He was long of leg, deft of hand, light of finger, soft of tongue ... His darting eye, long inquisitive nose and droll mouth gave his somewhat lean and bony face an expression of vivacity, candor, and affability. He had known many vicissitudes, gaining therefrom a suppleness, a fine discretion, a mastery of both bravado and stealth.\\" Cugel often finds himself in a situation of revenge, and tries to take advantage of those who used him, complaining when they trick him, curse him as he harms them, or expose his wiles. But almost always Cugel comes out on top, leaving a blazing trail of destruction and chaos behind him. He can be said to simultaneously have both the best and worst luck in all the Dying Earth. Cugel fancies himself a seducer of women, but his charms are apparent mainly to himself, and to certain types of women that wish to use him. His record is not good: he trades one, having lost her the rulership of a city (after she had manipulated him), to bandits in exchange for safe passage; another he must leave to drown, in the face of the monster \\"Magnatz\\", and does nothing to avert the destruction of her village (after she had broken a promise of everlasting love engagement); he causes the village of a third to be abandoned in dread (after she lies to the local thug religious zealots to get them to use force upon him). It must be said that he treats men scarcely better. For example, he bribes a priest, with all of his very valuable magical items, into tricking fifty pilgrims into a futile pilgrimage, to guard his crossing of a perilous desert - only fifteen survive. On the other hand, Cugel displays a genuine regard for the most selfless of the pilgrims, showing a trait of \\"do unto others...\\" which is essentially the basis of the book. Fix-up The components of the fix-up were five novelettes published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction between December 1965 and July 1966 and one, the second in sequence, published directly as part of the novel The Eyes of the Overworld in 1966 without any prior magazine appearance. \\"Cil\\", the second chapter, was later published as a stand-alone novelette in 1969 in the collection Eight Fantasms and Magics.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?11985 The Eyes of the Overworld has seven chapters because the last in sequence of the separately published novelettes, \\"The Manse of Iucounu\\", has two sections, which become two separate chapters in the book. .

Cugel pays the Busiacos a jewelled button to ferry him across a river that he could just as easily have waded through and then proceeds south, refusing to believe he has been duped even when he sees a nearby bridge. In the novel the episode is longer and more elaborate, and reveals Cugel to be not only gullible, but also capable of thoroughly despicable actions: after the events described in the interpolated chapter 2, \\"Cil\\", Cugel awakes in the northern wasteland with Derwe Coreme, whom he sells into slavery to the Busiacos in exchange for their redundantly guiding him across a stretch of forest measuring a hundred paces.

New Orleans Districts and Wards The Ward was formerly part of the old Jefferson City annexed by New Orleans in 1870. Boundaries The roughly wedge-shaped Ward stretches back from the Mississippi River. The lower boundary is Toledano Street, across which is the 11th Ward; the upper boundary is Napoleon Avenue, across which is the 13th Ward, and the back boundary is South Broad, across which is a portion of the 14th Ward. It includes a section of Uptown New Orleans, part of the Broadmoor neighborhood, and the neighborhoods of Milan and Touro.12th Ward, New Orleans New Orleans LA (NOLA) Retrieved February 25, 2013 Landmarks Landmarks include Touro Infirmary, Saint Charles General Hospital. Down from Napoleon Avenue is a series of streets perpendicular to the River named after the victories of Napoleon I. Other streets in this series are named after cities Napoleon dreamed of conquering but never reached (Constantinople) or at which his armies were defeated (Cadiz). Constantinople Street was the home of the fictitious New Orleans character Ignatius J. Reilly in John Kennedy Toole's novel A Confederacy of Dunces. Multi-platinum selling and Grammy-nominated recording artist Mystikal grew up in the 12th Ward near Tchoupitoulas. Saint Charles Avenue, with the famous St. Charles Avenue Streetcar, cuts through the neighborhood, and is the route of many New Orleans Mardi Gras parades. The Columns Hotel, a small hotel converted from a 19th- century mansion, on St. Charles, was used as a location in the film Pretty Baby. The Ward contains two branches of the New Orleans Public Library. The old Carnegie library on Napoleon just back from Magazine is now the city's Children's Resource Center library, and the Rosa Keller Branch at Broad & Napoleon. Portions of the Magnolia Projects along Louisiana Avenue are in the Ward. Other 12th Ward landmarks are Tipitina's music venue on Napoleon at Tchoupitoulas Street and Walter L. Cohen Senior High School on Dryades Street. Hurricane Katrina The majority of the Ward back from St. Charles Avenue flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Around the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Area, the bridge is more commonly known as the \\"New Bridge\\" because it is the younger of the two bridges that cross the river in Baton Rouge. The structure begins at the Louisiana Highway 1 (LA 1) exit south of Port Allen. After the interstate crosses the superstructure, it remains an elevated viaduct up to the Dalrymple Drive exit to Louisiana State University. It is the highest bridge on the Mississippi River. Name The bridge is named after three separate Horace Wilkinsons who served a total of 54 years in the Louisiana legislature.https://web.archive.org/web/20110807142210/http://michaelminn.net/america/bridges/horace_wilkinson_bridge/ Horace Wilkinson, along with his son and grandson, were honored with the naming of the I-10 bridge by Act 206 of the Louisiana Legislature in 1968. Traffic Sunset View The bridge is notorious amongst many for daily backups stretching a few miles (several kilometers). Most traffic stems from the I-10/I-110 junction. Eastbound traffic is reduced from three lanes to one through lane and an exit lane to Washington Street around a sharp curve. Traffic must be cautious as traffic from I-110 South may cross all lanes of traffic to exit at Washington street, only away. Because of this junction and lack of shoulders along the entire bridge, traffic usually backs up to, at least, the LA 415 exit (Exit 151) and for along LA 1 northbound. Westbound congestion occurs from slower traffic entering from the short transition zone of the St. Ferdinand Street entrance ramp and the narrowing of I-10 when it loses a lane to exit at LA 1. In response, Sherri LeBas, secretary of the LA DOTD, said that as of November 2013, it was not looking at widening or modernizing the I-10/I-110 interchange, citing cost. Instead, the state will modernize LA 1 from I-10 to US-190 to encourage detours to the less-congested Huey Long Bridge.State weighs options for easing I-10 traffic  Home  The Advocate ‚Äî Baton Rouge, Louisiana Improvements Around October 2003, the I-10E/I-110S merge was re-striped to reduce I-110 South from three lanes to two lanes, allowing I-10 its own lane, no longer mandating I-10 East commuters to shift to the left to continue on I-10 East. In August 2010, the I-10 West exit to LA 1 had been restriped to prevent the center lane from exiting. This change has since been reverted. In 2010, the bridge's signage was replaced. These newer signs better demarcate the boundary between West Baton Rouge Parish and East Baton Rouge Parish. The installed signs also displayed the official name of the bridge. A project began in 2015 to grind rust off the bridge.

It is typically due to neonatal bacterial infection, although can also be non-infectious (e.g. chemical exposure). Infectious neonatal conjunctivitis is typically contracted during vaginal delivery from exposure to bacteria from the birth canal, most commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention for gonococcal ophthalmia. This practice is recommended for all newborns and most hospitals in the United States are required by state law to apply eye drops or ointment soon after birth to prevent the disease. If left untreated, neonatal conjunctivitis can cause blindness. Signs and symptoms Neonatal conjunctivitis by definition presents during the first month of life. Signs and symptoms include: *Pain and tenderness in the eyeball *Conjunctival discharge: purulent, mucoid or mucopurulent (depending on the cause) *Conjunctival hyperaemia and chemosis, usually also with swelling of the eyelids *Corneal involvement (rare) may occur in herpes simplex ophthalmia neonatorum =Time of onset= Chemical causes: Right after delivery Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Delivery of the baby until 5 days after birth (early onset) Chlamydia trachomatis: 5 days after birth to 2 weeks (late onset ‚Äì C. trachomatis has a longer incubation period) =Complications= Untreated cases may develop corneal ulceration, which may perforate, resulting in corneal opacification and staphyloma formation. Cause =Non-infectious= Chemical irritants such as silver nitrate can cause chemical conjunctivitis, usually lasting 2‚Äì4 days. Thus, prophylaxis with a 1% silver nitrate solution is no longer in common use. In most countries, neomycin and chloramphenicol eye drops are used, instead. However, newborns can suffer from neonatal conjunctivitis due to reactions with chemicals in these common eye drops. Additionally, a blocked tear duct may be another noninfectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. =Infectious= The two most common infectious causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are N. gonorrheae and Chlamydia, typically acquired from the birth canal during delivery. However, other different bacteria and viruses can be the cause, including herpes simplex virus (HSV 2), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (N. gonorrhoeae) typically manifests in the first 5 days after birth and is associated with marked bilateral purulent discharge and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with C. trachomatis produces conjunctivitis 3 days to 2 weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (mucopurulent) and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2‚Äì19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10‚Äì14 days. Diagnosis is performed after taking swab from the infected conjuctivae. Prevention Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention against gonococcal ophthalmia. This may be erythromycin, tetracycline, or rarely silver nitrate or Argyrol (mild silver protein). Treatment Prophylaxis needs antenatal, natal, and postnatal care. * Antenatal measures include thorough care of mother and treatment of genital infections when suspected. * Natal measures are of utmost importance, as most infection occurs during childbirth. Deliveries should be conducted under hygienic conditions taking all aseptic measures. The newborn baby's closed lids should be thoroughly cleansed and dried. * If the cause is determined to be due to a blocked tear duct, a gentle palpation between the eye and the nasal cavity may be used to clear the tear duct. If the tear duct is not cleared by the time the newborn is 1 year old, surgery may be required. * Postnatal measures include: ** Use of 1% tetracycline ointment, 0.5% erythromycin ointment, or 1% silver nitrate solution (Crede's method) into the eyes of babies immediately after birth ** Single injection of ceftriaxone IM or IV should be given to infants born to mothers with untreated gonococcal infection. ** Curative treatment as a rule, conjunctival cytology samples and culture sensitivity swabs should be taken before starting treatment. * Chemical ophthalmia neonatorum is a self-limiting condition and does not require any treatment. * Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum needs prompt treatment to prevent complications. Topical therapy should include: ** Saline lavage hourly till the discharge is eliminated ** Bacitracin eye ointment four times per day (because of resistant strains, topical penicillin therapy is not reliable, but in cases with proven penicillin susceptibility, penicillin drops 5000 to 10000 units per ml should be instilled every minute for half an hour, every five minutes for next half an hour, and then half-hourly till the infection is controlled.) ** If the cornea is involved, then atropine sulfate ointment should be applied. ** The advice of both the pediatrician and ophthalmologist should be sought for proper management. Systemic therapy: Newborns with gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated for 7 days with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, or crystalline benzyl penicillin. * Other bacterial ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics drops and ointment for 2 weeks. * Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis caused by C. trachomatis should be treated with oral erythromycin. Topical therapy is not effective and also does not treat the infection of the nasopharynx.American Academy of Pediatrics. \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". In: Red Book: 2015 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 30th, Kimberlin DW (Ed), Elk Grove Village, IL p. 288. * Herpes simplex conjunctivitis should be treated with intravenous acyclovir for a minimum of 14 days to prevent systemic infection. Epidemiology The incidence of neonatal conjunctivitis varies widely depending on the geographical location. The incidence in England was 257 (95% confidence interval: 245 to 269) per 100,000 in 2011.

According to the American Psychological Association, the expression can have two meanings: (1) In psychoanalysis, projective identification is a defense mechanism in which the individual projects qualities that are unacceptable to the self onto another person, and that person internalizes the projected qualities and believes himself to be characterized by them appropriately and justifiably. (2) In the object relations theory of Melanie Klein, projective identification is a defense mechanism in which a person fantasizes that part of his ego is split off and projected into the object in order to harm or to protect the disavowed part.American Psychological Association, Dictionary of Psychology. In this second sense, it can be said that in a close relationship, as between parent and child, lovers, or therapist and patient, parts of the self may, in unconscious fantasy, be thought of as being forced into the other person.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 177 While based on Freud's concept of psychological projection,Projective identification projective identification represents a step beyond. In R.D. Laing's words, \\"The one person does not use the other merely as a hook to hang projections on. He/she strives to find in the other, or to induce the other to become, the very embodiment of projection\\".R. D. Laing, Self and Others (Penguin 1969) p. 111 Feelings which can not be consciously accessed are defensively projected into another person in order to evoke the thoughts or feelings projected.Michael Jacobs, Psychodynamic Counselling in Action (London 2006), p. 109 Projective identification may be used as a type of defense, a means of communicating, a primitive form of relationship, or a route to psychological change;Quoted in Jan Grant and Jim Crawley, Transference and Projection(Buckingham 2002), p. 31 used for ridding the self of unwanted parts or for controlling the other's body and mind.Patrick Casement, On Learning from the Patient (1985) p. 100n Experience Though a difficult concept for the conscious mind to come to terms with,Priscilla Roth, 'Projective Identification', in S.

Laing, Self and Others (Penguin 1969) p. 37 One therapist, for example, describes how \\"I felt the progressive extrusion of his internalized mother into me, not as a theoretical construct but in actual experience. The intonation of my voice altered, became higher with the distinctly Ur-mutter quality.\\"David Cooper, The Death of the Family (Penguin 1974) p. 113‚Äì4 If the projection can be accepted and understood, however, much insight into the projector will be obtained. Projective identification differs from simple projection in that projective identification can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby a person, believing something false about another, influences or coerces that other person to carry out that precise projection.Polly Young-Eisendrath/Terence Dawson, The Cambridge Companion to Jung (Cambridge 1977) p. 227 In extreme cases, the recipient may lose any sense of their real self and become reduced to the passive carrier of outside projections, as if possessed by them.T. Pitt-Aikens/A. T. Ellis, Loss of the Good Authority (London 1989) p. 120 and p. 133 This phenomenon has been noted in gaslighting. Objects projected The objects (feelings, attitudes) extruded in projective identification are of various kinds ‚Äì both good and bad, ideal and abjected. Hope may be projected by a client into their therapist, when they can no longer consciously feel it themselves;Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 121-2 equally, it may be a fear of (psychic) dying which is projected.Michael Parsons, The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes (2000) p. 166 Aggression may be projected, leaving the projector's personality diminished and reduced;R. Appignanesi ed., Introducing Melanie Klein (2006) p. 127 alternatively it may be desire, leaving the projector feeling asexual.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 69‚Äì73 The good/ideal parts of the personality may be projected, leading to dependence upon the object of identification;Rosalind Minsky, Psychoanalysis and Gender (1998) p. 86-7 equally it may be jealousy or envy that are projected, perhaps by the therapist into the client.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (1993) p. 11‚Äì2 Intensity Projective identification may take place with varying degrees of intensity.Robert D. Hinshelwood, \\"Projective Identification\\" In narcissism, extremely powerful projections may take place and obliterate the distinction between self and other.Hanna Segal, Klein (1979) p. 116‚Äì9 In less disturbed personalities, projective identification is not only a way of getting rid of feelings but also of getting help with them.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 98‚Äì9 In an emotionally balanced person, projective identification may act as a bridge to empathy and intuitive understanding.Robert D. Hinshelwood, \\"Projective Identification\\" Types Various types of projective identification have been distinguished over the years: * Acquisitive projective identification - where someone takes on the attributes of someone else. Unlike attributive projective identification, where someone else is induced to become one's own projection.John Rowan and Michael Jacobs, The Therapist's Use of Self (Buckingham 2002) p. 42 * Projective counter-identification - where the therapist unwittingly assumes the feelings and role of the patient to the point where he acts out within the therapy within this assumed role that has been projected into him, a step beyond the therapist merely receiving the patient's projections without acting on them.Grinberg L (1962) On a specific aspect of countertransference due to the patient's projective identification (In Classics of Psychoanalytical Technique) * Dual projective identification - a concept introduced by Joan Lachkar. It primarily occurs when both partners in a relationship simultaneously project onto one another. Both deny the projections, both identify with those projections.The Narcissistic/Borderline Couple: A Psychoanalytic Perspective on Marital Treatment (1st ed.). New York: Brunner/Mazel, 1992. A division has also been made between normal projective identification and pathological projective identification, where what is projected is splintered into minute pieces before the projection takes place.Hanna Segal,Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein (London 1964), p. 42-3 In psychotherapy As with transference and countertransference, projective identification can be a potential key to therapeutic understanding, especially where the therapist is able to tolerate and contain the unwanted, negative aspects of the patient's self over time.Harold Stewart, Psychic Experience and Problems of Technique (London 1992), p. 134 Transactional analysis emphasizes the need for the therapist's Adult to remain uncontaminated, if the experience of the client's projective identification is to be usefully understood.Petruska Clarkson, On Psychotherapy (London 1993), p. 180 and p. 184 Wounded couple Relationship problems have been linked to the way there can be a division of emotional labour in a couple, by way of projective identification, with one partner carrying projected aspects of the other for them.Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (London 1994), p. 5 Thus one partner may carry all the aggression or all the competence in the relationship, the other all the vulnerability.R. Skynner/J. Cleese, Families and how to survive them (1993) p. 47‚Äì54 Jungians describe the resultant dynamics as characterising a so-called \\"wounded couple\\" ‚Äì projective identification ensuring that each carries the most ideal or the most primitive parts of their counterpart.Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., The Cambridge Companion to Jung (Cambridge 1997) p. 237 The two partners may initially have been singled out for that very readiness to carry parts of each other's self; but the projected inner conflicts/division then come to be replicated in the partnership itself.Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., The Cambridge Companion to Jung (Cambridge 1997) p. 227 Responses Conscious resistance to such projective identificationPolly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., The Cambridge Companion to Jung (Cambridge 1997) p. 227 may produce on the one side guilt for refusing to enact the projection,R. D. Laing, Self and Others (Penguin 1969) p. 111 on the other bitter rage at the thwarting of the projection.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1993) p. 101 See also References Further reading * R.

Signs and symptoms Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency affected infants will have vomiting, low blood sugar, a lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, and failure to gain weight and grow. Additional features of this disorder may include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, developmental delays, and microcephaly. The symptoms of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be triggered during illnesses such as viral infections. In some cases, signs and symptoms may not appear until adulthood, when some individuals may develop muscle weakness, while other individuals mild symptoms may never be diagnosed. Genetics Chromosome 12 SCADD is caused genetically by mutations in the ACADS gene, located on chromosome 12q22-qter. Mutations in the ACADS gene lead to inadequate levels of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is important for breaking down short-chain fatty acids. Low levels of this enzyme halt short-chain fatty acids from being further broken down and processed in the mitochondria, consequently, these short-chain fatty acids are not converted into energy. The disorder is inherited via autosomal recessive. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 12 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene are needed in order to be born with this disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene. Diagnosis The diagnosis of short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is based on the following: * Newborn screening test * Genetic testing * Urine testupdate 2014 =Differential diagnosis= The differential diagnosis for short-chain acyl- coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is: ethylmalonic encephalopathy, mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Treatment Riboflavin In terms of treatment for short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, some individuals may not need treatment, while others might follow administration of: * Riboflavin * Dextrose * Anticonvulsants Epidemiology This disorder, epidemiologically speaking, is thought to affect approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns according to Jethva, et al. While in the U.S. state of California there seems to be a ratio of 1 in 35,000.

Eckart, a member of the Democratic Party, represented Ohio's 11th congressional district from 1983 to 1993, and Ohio's 22nd congressional district from 1981 to 1983. Before being elected to Congress, Eckart served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1975 to 1980. Early life and Career Born in Cleveland, Ohio with brothers Gary and Edward, Eckart attended St Joseph High School in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Xavier University in Cincinnati, receiving his B.A. in 1971. He went on to earn an LL.B. from Cleveland State University, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in 1974, and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1974. Eckart began his law career practicing in Cleveland and served as the assistant prosecutor in the Lake County, Ohio prosecuting attorney's office. In 1974 Eckart won a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives where he served three terms from 1975 until 1980. From 1978 until 1982 he served as a vice-president of the Slovene National Benefit Society.Enciklopedija Slovenije. (1988). Book #2. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga. United States House of Representatives In 1980, Eckart ran for the U.S. House to replace the vacant seat from retiring 13-term Congressman Charles Vanik. Eckart ran in Ohio's 11th congressional district, defeating State Senator Tim McCormack and State Representative Anthony O. Calabrese, Jr. with 40% of the vote in the Democratic primary. He went on to defeat Republican opponent Joseph Nahra with 55% of the vote in the general election. After the 1980 Census, Eckart's district was redrawn, moving him to Ohio's 22nd congressional district. The one-term Congressman defeated State Representative Marcus Roberto in the Democratic primary and Republican Glen W. Warner in the general election. Eckart served on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the House Committee on Small Business, where he served as Chairman of the Subcommittee for Antitrust, Deregulation and Ecology. During his tenure in the House, Eckart supported improving standards on environmental protection. He sponsored the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1983, a bill aimed to improve enforcement and greater protection for underground sources of drinking water. He also sponsored the Great Lakes Emergency Shoreline Protection Act, which would have started a federal guaranteed-loan program to provide for the protection from shoreline erosion of the Great Lakes. He also sponsored the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1987, amending the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for unlimited liability in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant, and the failed House Joint Resolution 617, establishing a balanced budget amendment the Constitution. Eckart gained notoriety for his portrayal of Dan Quayle in debate preparation with Lloyd Bentsen for the 1988 Vice Presidential debate. After the 1990 Census, with an overall decline in Ohio's population and redistricting, Eckart's district was distributed to the 13th, 14th, 17th and 19th districts. He then decided not to run for reelection in the updated districts and was succeeded by Congressman Eric Fingerhut. Post congressional career After his term in Congress, Eckart worked in the American Bar Association's Congressional Process Committee, and was also on the board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Allen Bridge is a truss cantilever bridge over the Mississippi River carrying US 190 (Airline Highway) and one rail line between East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana and West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. Although the bridge is named after former Louisiana governors Huey P. Long and Oscar K. Allen, it is known locally in the Baton Rouge Area as \\"the old bridge\\".\\"Paint Party\\". The Riverside Reader. [Port Allen, LA] October 1, 2012. Pg. 1. Print It was the only bridge across the Mississippi in Baton Rouge from its opening until April 1968, when the Horace Wilkinson Bridge (\\"the new bridge\\") carrying Interstate 10 opened. Until 2011, when the John James Audubon Bridge opened between St. Francisville and New Roads, it was the last bridge crossing the Mississippi before the Natchez-Vidalia Bridge, almost 100 miles to the north. Design The entrance to the Kaiser Aluminum plant under the bridge in 1972 The bridge is similar in design to the Huey P. Long Bridge in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana (until the downstream bridge was widened to six lanes in 2013). Its lanes are narrow and during cold weather, it has a tendency to ice over. Due to the low height of the bridge, Baton Rouge is the furthest inland port on the Mississippi River that can accommodate ocean-going tankers and cargo carriers. The ships transfer their cargo (grain, oil, cars, containers) at Baton Rouge onto rails and pipelines (to travel east‚Äìwest) or barges (to travel north). In addition, the river depth decreases significantly just to the north, near Port Hudson. State of repair The bridge itself is currently in a poor state of repair; the girder foundations on both railroad approach spans are beginning to show hairline cracks, but engineers have assured the city that the bridge is not in any imminent danger. The bridge has been repainted several times since its construction, including in the mid-1960s when the bridge was repainted orange. The bridge was originally painted blue, but dust from the Kaiser Aluminum plant on the southeast bank of the river kept coating the bridge with aluminum oxide (bauxite). Finally, the state gave up trying to keep the bridge blue, and went with the orange color of the dust.AA Roads - US Highway 190 Mississippi River Bridge John Weeks.com - Huey P. Long Bridge Planned Interstate 410 The bridge was once planned as part of an Interstate 410. Accidents Only one person is reported to have driven off the edge of the bridge. In 1945, a cargo truck driver headed eastbound careened off the sides. The driver fell through the windshield and was crushed on a dock as his truck landed on top of him. The scars from the accident can still be seen on the dock to one's right approaching the east end of the eastbound span.

Early life  Svatopluk Pluskal started playing football in his home town, where he played for several clubs. With (Ba≈•a Zl√≠n ‚Äì Svit Gottwaldov) he achieved promotion to the top league. He achieved individual success when he was selected for the junior international team. He was able to play in most positions, but in Zl√≠n he played mainly as a striker.  Pre-International Career  In 1951 he moved to Prague where he became an important player for a newly founded army football club (ATK, later called √öDA and Dukla Prague), for whom he played mainly as a defensive midfielder. In almost 16 years with this club, he was 8-time champion of the league but he achieved his most important successes at the club level in the United States. Dukla Praha with Pluskal in its line-up won the \\"American Cup\\" (a tournament of teams from football- developed countries) three times in a row in the first half of the 1960s. In 1962 Pluskal scored the winning goal in the final against Brazilian team FC America.  International career  He played in the Czechoslovak international team from 1952 (starting as a defender) and played in three World Cups. In 1954 he took part in the record 0‚Äì5 defeat by Austria in Switzerland. Four years later, at the 1958 world cup finals, Pluskal played in more games. Losing 1‚Äì0 to Northern Ireland, drawing 2‚Äì2 with West Germany, and scoring a remarkable 6‚Äì1 victory over Argentina, under modern rules they would have gone through. Under the rules of the time, having equal points, a play- off had to decide, and Northern Ireland beat them for the second time, this time 2‚Äì1 after extra time. In the 1962 World Cup in Chile, Pluskal was a member of the line-up. With his teammate from Dukla, Josef Masopust, he formed the key midfield of the 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 formation. Thanks to Pluskal, the team that had had to qualify for the Championships in a playoff with Scotland had got to the World Cup final. There it was beaten by Brazil. In 1965, Pluskal played in the unsuccessful qualification campaign for the World Cup in England, but with this his international career ended. He played 56 matches in Czechoslovak colours and scored one goal. Thanks to his important contribution to the success in Chile, Pluskal received recognition on the international stage. On 23 October 1963, he was a member of the \\"Rest of the World\\" team that took on England at Wembley in front of 100,000 fans, to celebrate 100 years of English football. A year later, he played for the \\"Europe\\" team in Belgrade against Yugoslavia, and appeared for Europe again in 1965 against Great Britain.England Player Honours - International Representative Teams, England Football Online Pluskal's career was ended by a knee injury in 1967. In the league he played 282 matches and scored 37 goals. He was a universal footballer, a good header of the ball, and he was famous for his slide tackles, with which he cleanly took the ball from his opponents. Although players often protested against this style of play, referees usually considered it to be within the rules. During his football career, this tireless fighter became an impenetrable shield, able to concentrate on what was needed. Off the field, he helped the team with his easy humour.  Late life  As with many other former players, Pluskal became a coach. He did this job for Plze≈à clubs ≈†koda and Slovan, later on for FC Bohemians Praha and for a few years in Enosis Neon Paralimni of Cyprus. He helped Bohemians with their promotion to the First Division. After a brain stroke Pluskal was confined to bed. He died at the age of 74.

The Campbells of Craignish (Mac D√∫bhghaill Creaginnis in the Scottish Gaelic or G√†idhlig), form one of the oldest branches of the ancient and powerful Clan Campbell in Scotland.. They claim descent from Dugald Campbell, the second son of Sir Archibald Gillespic Campbell (b.1130), 5th Knight of Lochawe and 20th Chief of Clan Campbell at the time. Sir Archibald's first son, Sir Duncan Campbell, 6th Knight of Lochawe, was the founder of the principal branch of the Campbell family who today holds the title Duke of Argyll. The family - the eldest cadets of the house of Argyll. - was a virile race, its members in all generations, to their cost, little disposed to diplomacy or guile, but staunch defenders of their rights and good soldiers By alliances through marriage and conquest they quickly acquired large possessions, and their growing power was noticed with apprehension and jealousy by the parent house of Lochow. The family no longer owns the Lairdship of Craignish (see below). The coat of arms of Dugall Campbell of Craignish (below) is described in Nisbet's \\"A System of Heraldry\\" as 'gyronny of eight or and sable, the shield hanging from the mast of a lymphad sable'. The coat of arms left is the suggested arms of the current incumbent - the Ducal Crown is awarded because the holder is a Clan Chieftain, but it is tinctured blue because the original estates are no longer in possession of the Chieftain. The Chief of the Clan is also Chief of Clan MacInnes, and Chief of the Name MacIsaac, MacKissock and MacKessack.  Craignish Castle  The founder of the Campbells of Craignish, Dugall Maul Campbell became first Laird of Craignish and his descendants built and resided in Craignish Castle, on the Craignish peninsula in Argyll.. Ranald MacCallum was made hereditary keeper of Craignish Castle in 1510. However, the castle has long since escaped family hands, and in 1832 was rebuilt as a private mansion for Mr. Trench-Gascoigne, who owned nearly 6000 acres (24 km¬≤) in Argyllshire. Today, the Castle has been converted into apartments and is owned privately.  Lairds of Craignish  *Sir Archibald Campbell, 5th Knight of Lochawe, 20th Chieftain of Argyll *Dugald Maul Campbell (1156‚Äì1190), second son of above, 1st Laird and Chieftain of Campbell of Craignish *Dugald Campbell, 2nd Laird (1178‚Äì1220), 2nd Chieftain *Dugald Campbell, 3rd Laird (1200‚Äì1250), 3rd Chieftain *Dugald Campbell, 4th Laird (1225‚Äì1250), 4th Chieftain *Dugald Campbell, 5th Laird (d.1270), 5th Chieftain *Malcolm Campbell, 5th Laird (1250‚Äì1290), 5th Chieftain *Sir Dugald Campbell, 6th Laird (1272-????), 6th Chieftain *Sir Dugald Campbell, 7th Laird (1300‚Äì1350), 7th Chieftain *Christina Campbell (b.1323), 8th Chieftain The 7th Laird had left only one daughter, Christine Campbell (b. 1323). Her weakness and imprudence caused the majority of the estate to be resigned to the Knight of Lochawe, who took advantage of her. She was left with only a small portion of the upper part of Craignish under his superiority. The nearest male representative - Ronald Campbell - was a nephew of her grandfather, and he fought hard to win back his heritage. The then Chief of Clan Campbell was obliged to allow him possession of a considerable portion of the estate, but retaining the superiority, and inserting a condition in the grant that if there was ever no male heir in the direct line the lands were to revert automatically to the Argyll family. *Ronald Campbell of Corranmore, nephew of the 6th Laird, became the 8th Laird and 9th Chieftain *John 'Ean Gorm' Campbell, 9th Laird, 10th Chieftain *Donald McEan Gorm Campbell, second son of the 9th Laird, became the 10th Laird, 11th Chieftain & 1st Baron Campbell of Barrichebean *Dugald Campbell, eldest son of Archibald, eldest son of the 9th Laird, became 11th Laird and 12th Chieftain *Ronald Campbell, natural son of the above, became 12th Laird and 13th Chieftain *Dugald Oig Campbell, 13th Laird, 14th Chieftain *John Campbell Aird of Craignish, natural son of the above, 14th Laird and 15th Chieftain *John Campbell, second son of the above, 15th Laird and 16th Chieftain *Dugald Campbell, 16th Laird, 17th Chieftain *Gillespic Campbell, second son of the above, 17th Laird, 18th Chieftain, died without children The rightful heir was now Charles 'Tearlach Mor' Campbell, of Corranmore, Craignish, first of Clan Tearlach. Charles was the nephew of Dugald Campbell, 11th Laird and 12th Chieftain. But Charles had been banished from Argyll, and the lands of Craignish reverted to the Earls of Argyll. The descendants of Donald McEan Gorm Campbell, 10th laird and 11th Chieftain of Craignish, retained Barrichebean and were fortunate enough to buy back the greater part of the estate of Craignish between 1550 and 1680, which they possessed under the patronymic MacDoil Vic Ean. *John Campbell, invested as 2nd Baron of Barrichibean in 1492, son of the 10th Laird *Donald Campbell, invested as the 3rd Baron, 1532 *Iain Campbell, invested as the 4th Baron, 1544 *Donald Campbell, invested as the 5th Baron, 1562 *John Campbell, invested as the 6th Baron, 1569 *Donald Campbell, 7th Baron *George Campbell, 8th Baron *Dugald Campbell, 9th Baron *Captain Dugald Campbell, 10th Baron *Colin Campbell, 11th Baron Clan Tearlach and the Inverneill Campbells *John 'Ean Gorm' Campbell, 9th Laird and 10th Chieftain of Clan Campbell of Craignish *Archibald Campbell, eldest son and heir of, but predeceased, the 10th Chieftain of Craignish *Charles 'Tearlach Mor' Campbell, of Corranmore, Craignish, first of 'Tearlach,' rightful heir of Dugald Oig, 14th of Craignish *John Campbell McKerlich (d.1575), 2nd Chief of Clan Tearlach *Charles Campbell McKerlich (d.1607), of Ardconaig, 3rd Chief of Clan Tearlach *'Crippled' John Campbell McKerlich, of Easter Duncrosk, 4th Chief of Clan Tearlach *'Mild' Patrick Campbell (k.1676), of Morinche, 5th of Tearlach *Charles 'Tearlach Ban' Campbell (1650‚Äì1723), 6th of Tearlach, Baron Baillie and 1st of Tuerechan, Glenlochy *Patrick Campbell (1675‚Äì1753), 7th of Tearlach, 2nd of Tuerechan *James Campbell (1706‚Äì1760), 8th of Tearlach, 3rd of Tuerechan, Commissary of the Western Isles *Sir James Campbell (1737‚Äì1805) Kt., M.P., 9th of Tearlach, 2nd of Inverneill When the direct line of the Campbells of Craignish ended in 1544, the rightful heir, a collateral relative by the name of Charles 'Tearlach Mor' Campbell of Corranmore in Craignish had the misfortune to kill Gillies of Glenmore in a brawl. This compelled him to flee to Perthshire where he settled at Lochtayside under the protection of the Breadalbane family. This unfortunate event therefore prevented Charles from claiming the estate, and so it fell into the hands of the Earls (later Dukes) of Argyll. Charles' descendant, Sir James Campbell (1737‚Äì1805) of Killin, Perthshire, and the 2nd of Inverneill, was recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as the 9th Chieftain of the Clan Tearlach branch of Clan Campbell. A grandson of Duncan Campbell 8th of Inverneill in the 1980s owned one of the apartments at Craignish Castle. The arms of Campbell of Inverneill are those of Campbell of Craignish differenced by the addition of \\"a bordure azure\\" (a blue border). The first and third Campbells of Inverneill (General Sir Archibald Campbell of Inverneill and Sir James Campbell of Inverneill, 1st Bt.) were interred at Westminster Abbey in what is now known as Poets' Corner. The second, Sir James Campbell of Inverneill and many succeeding Campbells of Inverneill are interred in the Campbell of Inverneill Mausoleum, though the late Dr John Lorne Campbell of Inverneill (and of Canna) is interred on the Isle of Canna where he had lived for over 50 years. The estates of Inverneill, with the exception of the Mausoleum and Inverneill Island, were sold in the 1950s. Inverneill Island remains in the ownership of the present Campbell of Inverneill. One part of the inheritance which did not revert to the Argylls was the small Barony of Barrichibean, which John Campbell had inherited from his mother's father. This Barony is not currently possessed by anyone today, but genealogical records point to some likely successors. Barons Craignish and von Laurentz[edit] The Barony of Craignish was revived towards the end of the 19th Century when, in 1882, Ronald MacLeay Laurentz Campbell was created Baron Craignish by the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In January 1883 he was granted permission to use the title in the United Kingdom. Three years later in 1886, his younger brother, Edmund Kempt Laurentz Campbell was similarly ennobled, becoming Baron Campbell of Laurentz. Again like his brother, he was granted permission to use this title in the United Kingdom in a Royal Warrant dated 14th February 1887. Edmund Campbell had distinguished himself in August 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. On 16 August at the battle of Mars-La- Tour/Gravelotte he was wounded leading a cavalry charge against the French and subsequently awarded the Iron Cross. Both brothers served as aides-de-camp to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Edmund Campbell‚Äôs marriage was childless and with his death in 1917, the Barony became extinct. His wife, Sarah Elizabeth Campbell, published a book in 1913 called 'My Motor Milestones: How to Tour in a Car', and was a member of the Italian Greyhound Club. Edmund Campbell‚Äôs older brother Ronald died in 1897, being succeeded by his son, also called Ronald, who became the 2nd Baron Craignish. He died in 1920 without issue causing his Barony to become extinct also. ‚Ä¢ Ronald MacLeay Laurentz Campbell, 1st Baron Craignish ‚Ä¢ Ronald Campbell, 2nd Baron Craignish ‚Ä¢ Edmund Kempt Laurentz Campbell, Baron of Laurentz ‚Ä¢ Sarah Elizabeth Campbell, Baroness of Laurentz  Incumbent  The title 'Laird of Craignish' is no longer used, because the title 'Laird' conveys a sense of ownership of land, and the Craignish estates were lost long ago (see above). However, most of these properties have since been sold on. The House of Craignish represents thousands of Campbells worldwide, but currently no Chieftain has been identified. The title 'Baron Campbell von Laurents' is a German title, which was restricted in inheritance to the male line of the original holder, meaning it is now extinct.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles y Qui√±ones de Le√≥n (Salamanca, 27 November 1898 - Madrid, 13 September 1980) was a Spanish politician, leader of the CEDA and a prominent figure in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War. He served as Minister of War from May to December 1935. In the 1936 elections the CEDA was defeated, and support for Gil-Robles and his party evaporated. As Civil War approached, Gil-Robles was unwilling to struggle with Francisco Franco for power and in April 1937 he announced the dissolution of CEDA, and went into exile. Abroad, he negotiated with Spanish monarchists to try to arrive at a common strategy for taking power in Spain. In 1968 he was named a professor of the University of Oviedo and published his book No fue posible la paz ('Peace Was Not Possible'). He was a member of the International Tribunal at the Hague. After the death of Franco and the end of his regime, Gil-Robles became one of the leaders of the \\"Spanish Christian Democracy\\" party, which however failed to win support in the Spanish general elections in 1977. Biography =Early life= Jos√© Maria Gil-Robles was born in Salamanca on 27 November 1898. He was the son of Enrique Gil Robles, a conservative Spanish law scholar and a Carlist theorist, whose ancestors were hidalgos from Le√≥n. Carlism was a traditionalist political movement in Spain whose goal was to establishing an alternative branch of the Bourbon dynasty. Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil- Robles received his master's degree in 1919 and in 1922 he gained by examination the chair of political law in the University of La Laguna (Tenerife). =Politics= During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera he was secretary of the Catholic-Agrarian National Confederation and member of the Writing Council of El Debate. After the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, he participated in and led the Acci√≥n Nacional (National Action) party, later renamed Acci√≥n Popular (Popular Action). In the elections of 1931 he was chosen as a deputy in the Cortes for Salamanca. During the period of the Republic, he maintained the posture of \\"accidentalism\\": whether Spain was a monarchy or republic was less important than the law's compatibility with religious principles. =Leader of CEDA= Gil-Robles was the leader of the CEDA. Gil-Robles formed the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), a conservative Catholic party, the political heir to √Ångel Herrera Oria's Acci√≥n Popular and fought for the \\"affirmation and defence of the principles of Christian civilization\\". The CEDA won the largest number of seats in elections of November 1933, and Gil-Robles was thus the head of the largest party in the Cortes. However, to avoid conflicts with leftist parties, President Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora invested Alejandro Lerroux, leader of the Radical Republican Party, as prime minister instead of Gil-Robles. The appointment of three CEDA ministers to the cabinet in 1934 triggered the leftist Asturian miners' strike that rose, ultimately unsuccessfully, against the government of the Republic. Gil-Robles served as Minister of War under Lerroux from May to December 1935. =1936 elections, defeat and uprising= During the February 1936 Spanish general election, the CEDA formed the largest part of the National Front coalition, which also included Alfonsine monarchists and Carlists. Gil-Robles campaigned under the slogan Todo el poder para el Jefe (\\"All the power to the Chief [i.e., Gil Robles]\\"), and while he himself was reelected to the Cortes, the conservative National Front narrowly lost the election, with power swinging to the left. The CEDA itself lost ground, winning 88 seats, fewer than the 115 they had won in 1933. Following the narrow victory of the leftist Popular Front and the defeat of the CEDA, support for Gil-Robles and his party declined, losing both votes and membership to the Falange party, founded in 1934, whose share of the vote had been very small in the 1936 elections. Bitterly disillusioned with the failure of their jefe to win the election, the CEDA's youth group Juventudes de Acci√≥n Popular went over en masse to the Falange. In the following months and in the volatile situation that arose, Gil-Robles was well aware that a coup was being prepared against the government. Despite his later insistence that he had no part in the destruction of the Republic, the CEDA leader was kept informed of each stage of the plot; members of his party played important liaison roles, facilitating contact between military and civilian plotters. Gil-Robles himself authorized the transfer of 500,000 pesetas of CEDA electoral funds to General Emilio Mola's military insurgents.Mary Vincent, Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic, p.243, Paul Preston, Coming of the Spanish Civil War ch 7, (ch 8 2nd edn) =Civil War= General Franco, Gil-Robles' rival for power With the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, following the uprising on 17 July 1936, Gil-Robles found himself unwilling or unable to struggle with Francisco Franco for power. Franco himself was determined not to have competing right-wing parties in Spain, and in April 1937 Gil-Robles announced the dissolution of CEDA. After the Civil War, Gil-Robles went into exile. Abroad, he negotiated with Spanish monarchists to try to arrive at a common strategy for taking power in Spain. =Later Life= In 1968 he was named a professor of the University of Oviedo and published his book No fue posible la paz ('Peace Was Not Possible'). He was a member of the International Tribunal at the Hague. After the death of Franco and the end of his regime, Gil-Robles became one of the leaders of the Spanish Christian Democracy party, which won little support in the Spanish general elections in 1977. Family Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles y Gil-Delgado (2011) Gil-Robles' son, Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles, was born on 17 June 1935 in Madrid. Like his father, he entered politics, serving as a member of the European Parliament in the European People's Party group, and as President of the European Parliament from 1997 to 1999. Legacy Gil- Robles is a unique and controversial figure in the history of Spanish politics. The nature of his political beliefs during the Second Republic either greatly fluctuated or were tailored to his audience, as he is recorded as making many statements that appear contradictory. This is certainly reflected in the nature of his party, the CEDA, which attracted support from both moderate Catholic republicans and avowed right-wing monarchists. =Judgment of historians= The controversy surrounding him has been best articulated by the historians Paul Preston and Richard Robinson: *Preston believes that Gil-Robles was essentially a legalist fascist, whose policy of accidentalism would give way to legislating for a fascist dictatorship when he was confident that the populace was controllable. His evidence references Gil Robles' speeches, which were often filled with \\"anti-democratic and anti- Semitic innuendo\\", the oppressive, anti-reformist nature of his government partnership with Alejandro Lerroux's Radicals, and the frank admiration offered to foreign fascist regimes by both his propaganda and by his press organ, El Debate. Burnett Bolloten argues Robles was aware of the planned coup and July 1936, he turned over half a million peseta's from CEDA's funds to the generals. However, Bolloton does observe that his support was given in a rather reluctant manner, conditional upon the knowledge that CEDA was disintegrating by this time and he refused to go along with General Mola's request that Spanish right-wing parliamentarians convene at Burgos on 17 July to denounce the government as unlawful.Bolloten, B., 1991. The Spanish civil war: Revolution and counterrevolution. Univ of North Carolina Press, pp.18-19 *Robinson, however, rejects any claim that Gil-Robles was anything but a consummate politician struggling to keep the unstable right under control and within the law. The CEDA was not a mere front for fascist aspirations but a party that was based on Catholic values, including a desire to pursue social Catholicism. Gil Robles himself certainly expressed pro-republican views; in an interview with the American journalist Mallory Browne he said, \\"I am the only friend of the Republic\\" and was recorded as declaring that \\"a new dictatorship would produce, after a period of tranquillity, social revolution.\\" Manuel Tardio and Ramon Arango argues that Gil Robles, despite possessing some authoritarian tendencies, did not advocate a dictatorship and neither he nor CEDA stepped beyond the limits of the constitution.Arango, E. Ram√≥n, and E. Ramon Arango. The Spanish political system: Franco's legacy. Routledge, 2019.√Ålvarez Tard√≠o, Manuel. \\"Politics, Violence and Electoral Democracy in Spain: the case of the CEDA, 1933-1934.\\" Bulletin for Spanish and Portuguese Historical Studies 35, no. 1 (2011): 7. Burnett Bolloten observes that Robles refused to seize power with the help of the military and monarchists after becoming war minister in May 1935, something for which they would never forgive him. After the Spanish Right's victory in the November 1933 elections, he maintained support for non-violence and wanted to use evolutionary rather than dictatorial means for achieving his vision of a corporative Spain, despite criticism from monarchist's and his own party's youth section.Bolloten, B., 1991.

It was designed by William Weaver (plans) and Alexander Dawson (supervision) and built from 1857 to 1859 by Charles Bingemann & Ebenezer Dewar. It is also known as The Sydney Observatory; Observatory; Fort Phillip; Windmill Hill; and Flagstaff Hill. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000. The site was formerly a defence fort, semaphore station, time ball station, meteorological station, observatory and windmills. The site evolved from a fort built on 'Windmill Hill' in the early 19th century to an observatory during the nineteenth century. It is now a working museum where evening visitors can observe the stars and planets through a modern Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and an historic refractor telescope built in 1874, the oldest telescope in Australia in regular use.  History  =Early use of the site= The site of the Sydney Observatory has been a significant place in Sydney and has undergone a number of name changes. It was known as Windmill Hill in the 1790s when it was the site of the first windmill. After 1804 references are made to it as Fort Phillip or Citadel Hill, referring to the construction, but never completion, of a citadel on the site at Governor King's instruction for use in the case of an insurrection in Sydney. This was prompted by an influx of \\"Death or Liberty\\" Boys after the abortive 1798 uprising in Ireland, some of whom he believed to be of the most desperate character and cause for constant suspicion. Construction began but the citadel was not completed until Bligh had been installed in office. There were further discussions about a citadel during the Macquarie period but nothing eventuated beyond a half built powder magazine, Francis Greenway's first work after his appointment as civil architect in 1815. In 1797, early on during the European settlement of New South Wales, Australia, a windmill was built on the hill above the first settlement. Within ten years the windmill had deteriorated to the point of being useless; the canvas sails were stolen, a storm damaged the machinery, and already by 1800 the foundations were giving way. The name of Millers Point remembers this early land use. In 1803, Fort Philip was built on the site under the direction of Governor Hunter to defend the new settlement against a possible attack by the French and also from rebellious convicts. The fort was never required to be used for any such purposes. In 1825 the eastern wall of the fort was converted to a signal station. Flags were used to send messages to ships in the harbour and to the signal station on the South Head of the harbour. The site was known as Flagstaff Hill during and after the Macquarie era. A flagstaff had been erected on the site by 1811. Flag signalling was a cumbersome process and Commissioner Bigge advised Macquarie that it was expedient to erect a semaphore at South Head and Fort Phillip. The flag and semaphore were used for signalling in a variety of combinations. =Observatory= Sydney Observatory at night An early observatory was established in 1788 by William Dawes on Dawes Point, at the foot of Observatory Hill, in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to observe in 1790 the return of a comet suggested by Edmond Halley (not Halley's Comet but a different one). In 1848, a new signal station was built by the Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis, on top of the fort wall on Windmill Hill. At the instigation of the Governor, Sir William Denison, it was agreed seven years later to build a full observatory next to the signal station. The first Government Astronomer, William Scott, was appointed in 1856, and work on the new observatory was completed in 1858. The most important role of the observatory was to provide time through the time-ball tower. Every day at exactly 1.00 pm, the time-ball on top of the tower would drop to signal the correct time to the city and harbour below. At the same time a cannon on Dawes Point was fired, later the cannon was moved to Fort Denison. The first time- ball was dropped at noon on 5 June 1858. Soon after the drop was rescheduled to one o'clock. The time-ball is still dropped daily at 1pm using the original mechanism, but with the aid of an electric motor, not as in the early days when the ball was raised manually. After the federation of Australia in 1901, meteorology became a function for the Commonwealth Government from 1908, while the observatory continued its astronomical role. The observatory continued to contribute observations to The astrographic catalogue, kept time and provided information to the public. For example, each day the observatory supplied Sydney newspapers with the rising and setting times of the sun, moon and planets. A proposal to close the observatory in 1926 was narrowly avoided, but, by the mid-1970s, the increasing problems of air pollution and city light made work at the observatory more and more difficult. In 1982, the NSW Government decided that Sydney Observatory was to be converted into a museum of astronomy and related fields as part of what is now the Powerhouse Museum. In November 1821 Governor Brisbane arrived with a set of astronomical instruments, a plan for an observatory and two personal employees with astronomical expertise - Charles Rumker and James Dunlop. Brisbane set up an observatory at the Governor's residence in Parramatta. Problems developed between Brisbane and Rumker. Rumker lost his position and it was not until Brisbane had been recalled that Rumker was reinstated by the Colonial Secretary. The following year Governor Darling, the new Governor, appointed Rumker as Government Astronomer, the first to hold the title in Australia. In 1831 Dunlop was appointed Superintendent at the observatory, Rumker again losing his position while on a visit to London. Brisbane's instruments remained at Parramatta when he left and they were used in that observatory until it was closed in 1847. The recommendation for the closure came from a commission appointed by Governor Fitzroy at the prompting of London. Dunlop had become increasingly frail and negligent and the Parramatta observatory had fallen into decay. The instruments were placed in ordnance storage at the urge of Phillip Parker King, a leading astronomer in Australia. Construction of an observatory King argued that a government observatory should be set up, and not just the suggested time ball. King's preference for Fort Phillip to be the site was eventually accepted. In the eight years from Edmund Blacket's modest 1850 plan for the time ball observatory until its completion, the plans underwent progressive enlargement. The 1850 plan was a room for a transit telescope and timekeeping apparatus with a small ante-room. In 1851 an enlarged version was presented to the Colonial Secretary but it had no time ball tower, because neither King or Blacket, the Colonial Architect, knew how it worked. The need for an Observer's dwelling was noted. Plans were redrawn in the next couple of years. When Blacket resigned in 1854 to take on the design and supervision of construction of The University of Sydney, plans were underway for an observatory that would be both functional and of architectural quality. Blacket's successor, William Weaver, replaced him on the observatory project. Weaver was appointed Colonial Architect in October 1854. Correspondence from him to Blacket in the early years indicates that Weaver was much happier in direct supervision of works than performing the duties of his desk-bound role. As head of an over-loaded department, he complained: A Select Committee on the Colonial Architect's Department in August 1855 questioned an overpayment to the stonemasonry contractor of the Dead House at Circular Quay and accused him of defrauding the Government. Weaver, as head of the Department, was accused of negligence for paying him and subsequently submitted his resignation in apparent disgust. Weaver was only 18 months as Colonial Architect and of the two major architectural works to come from his Department during his term in office, the Government Printing Office at the corner of Phillip and Bent Streets no longer stands and the Sydney Observatory has been generally attributed to his successor. In fact, Sir William Denison approved Weaver's plans \\"for an Observatory and Astronomical resicence\\" in August 1855 after some specifications supplied by Denison had been incorporated. When building commenced a year later the new Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson adopted those plans. Little more was done until the arrival of Sir William Denison as Governor General in January 1855. Denison saw an observatory as an important addition to the colony. As a result, the allocated to the time ball and building was augmented by an additional vote of for a complete observatory and Denison wrote to the Astronomer Royal asking him to find a competent astronomer. Plans and estimates were submitted in August 1855 but Denison decided to defer the final decision on the site and design until the arrival of the astronomer. Alexander Dawson replaced Weaver as Colonial Architect in April 1856 and the new Government Astronomer, Reverend William Scott, M.A., arrived with his family in October that year. Tenders for the construction were advertised in February 1857. The successful tenderers were Charles Bingemenn and Ebenezer Dewar. The plans used appear to have been the work of Dawson rather than those of his predecessors, there being numerous references by Scott to consultations with the Colonial Architect on the design of the building. Extra work was approved after Bingemann and Dewar won their tender. This included the addition of a telescope dome and an increase in the height of the time ball tower. This increased height caused some dismay for Scott as it blocked out an increased area of the eastern sky. The completed building combined, for the first time in a major Sydney building, two architectural streams - Italian High Renaissance Palazzo and the Italian Villa forms. These contributed the symmetry of the townhouse facade for the residence and an asymmetry for the observatory born of the peculiar needs of transit room, equatorial dome and time ball tower. The building was thus elevated from basic necessity to fashionable stylishness. Dawson's budget had enabled him to emphasise the distinction between the private and the public, the domestic and the official. The style and form was overlaid with early Victorian theories of fitness and association, that style should be chosen to indicate the nature and status of the building and in some cases, the site. Operations, 1858 to 1980s A telescope of Sydney Observatory Scott occupied the residence in 1858 and commenced a trial operation of the time ball in June. His initial equipment was modest, mostly the instruments from Parramatta. He did, however, obtain the money for an equatorial telescope. In 1862 Scott resigned, recommending prominent amateur astronomer John Tebbutt as his replacement. Tebbutt declined the offer and the search for a replacement was commenced. In the meantime, his assistant Henry Chamberlain Russell was left in charge of the observatory. In January 1864 the new appointee George Robarts Smalley arrived and Russell was his second in command. In 1870 Smalley died and was replaced by Russell. Russell's talent, entrepreneurial flair, intimate knowledge of how to work the political and bureaucratic system of NSW and longevity gave him a 35-year tenure as Government Astronomer and made him the Grand Old Man of physical science in the colonies. It was during Russell's period that Sydney Observatory was popularly believed to have been at its professional zenith, particularly from the 1870s through to the 1890s. Russell wasted no time in pressing the government for the necessary physical and instrumental resources to carry out his astronomical programs at the observatory. The addition of a west wing designed by colonial architect James Barnett was the main work resulting from this. It provided for a major ground floor room for Russell, a library, a second equatorial dome on a tower at its northern extremity which removed the blind spot imposed by the time ball tower. An enlarged Muntz metal dome was also placed on the old equatorial tower to accommodate a new Schroeder telescope. The telescope remains a prized and functional possession today. Russell also turned his attention to improving the residence, claiming it was not large enough to accommodate his family. In 1875 Russell succeeded in securing an extension of the observatory enclosure. Like his predecessors, he had been concerned with the restrictive nature of the observatory grounds which made siting of meteorological and auxiliary astronomical instruments difficult, if not impossible. This extension, together with the adjacent signal station give the site its present symmetrical perimeter. The Astrographic Catalogue was Russell's greatest commitment and would affect programs at the observatory for 80 years. His interest in the application of photography to astronomy and a visit to Paris in 1887 prompted Russell to take part in a \\"great star catalogue\\". The Sydney Zone of the catalogue was a massive logistical enterprise and was not practically completed until 1964. Russell died in 1907 after taking leave for an extended period of time due to ill health. His assistant Alfred Lenehan was appointed acting Government Astronomer during this period and later Government Astronomer in 1907. However, in 1906 a premier's conference resolved that the Commonwealth Government would take over meteorological work, leaving astronomy to the states. Thus, the meteorological section of the observatory became a Commonwealth agency under the direction of a former officer of the observatory, Henry Hunt. Lenehan and Hunt continuously quarrelled and did not develop a good working relationship. In January 1908 Lenehan had a stroke and never returned to work. At the same time the Commonwealth agency was installed in the observatory residence. William Edward Raymond, the officer responsible for transit work, became officer in charge for four years, until the appointment of William Ernest Cooke in 1912. Cooke was lured to Sydney from Perth Observatory with promises of a new site located in Wahroongah, then free of city lights and traffic, the purchase of modern instruments and a world trip to investigate the latest developments. None of these eventuated during Cooke's fourteen years at the observatory. In 1916 the board of visitors to the observatory was reconstituted. Russell had allowed it to lapse during his term of office and in 1917 the residence was again inhabited by the Astronomer. Photoheliograph used to photograph the sun.All government astronomers from Scott to Cooke were worried about increasing levels of city light, vibration from traffic and magnetic disturbance which rendered the Flagstaff Hill site increasingly unsuitable. Recommendations had been made by Smalley in 1864 and others in the first quarter of the twentieth century. While Russell had managed to have the astrographic telescope relocated to Pennant Hills, there was general worry over the reaction to the cost of relocation of the whole observatory. In July 1925 Cooke wrote to his minister pointing out the problems at the site and with the equipment. The State Cabinet took him at his word and in October decided to close the observatory rather than face the cost of removal and re-equipment. However, protests from the Board of Visitors, the Royal Society of NSW, the NSW Branch of the British Astronomical Association, the University of Sydney and interested members of the public caused the Government to change its mind and allow the observatory to continue - but with a heavily reduced staff and program. Most of the staff were transferred to other departments and Cooke was retired the following year. Only the time ball and completion of the astrographic program survived. This experience inhibited later Government Astronomers in their arguments for a new site. Two World Wars, a great depression and a commitment to a logistically exacting astrographic program helped reduce the vitality of the establishment in the twentieth century. The deployment of major resources to the astrographic program became something of an incubus as the twentieth century progressed. The Government Astronomers could not suspend or abort the program even if they had thought it desirable. At the same time the fulfilment of international obligations under the program was largely instrumental in the survival of the observatory. The completion of the program in 1964 and publication of the final volume in 1971 meant the observatory's days were numbered. Other fundamental reasons also contributed to the notion that the observatory was no longer a viable proposition. The transfer of meteorology to the Commonwealth in 1908 removed the observatory's most high-profile public service, electric telegraphy and radio had reduced and in time eliminated the need for local navigational and time services. Ambient city light was starting to restrict astronomical observation though the place was still suitable for the time-consuming analysis of the observations and other astronomical work together with functions such as a public observatory and a centre for public and media enquiries. Post World War II was an exciting time for Australian astronomical development, particularly in radio astronomy. These developments bypassed Sydney though the Government Astronomer Harley Wood kept a close involvement as the first president of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) in 1966 and as the co-ordinator of the first International Astronomical Union (IAU) General Assembly to be held in the southern hemisphere in Sydney, 1973. Without major capital funds to develop its own specialisations in the west, Sydney remained tied to its traditional role. Despite this there was some positive activity at the observatory. During the 1950s and 1960s under Wood, the observatory enjoyed a modest renaissance. Staff numbers were built up and new equipment acquired. Both the Sydney and Melbourne sections of the Astrographic catalogue were completed and published. A new domed building was constructed in the south-east corner of the observatory to house the Melbourne star camera that replaced the original Sydney one. A new survey of the southern sky was commenced and by 1982 Wood's successor William Robertson had completed the photography and measurement was underway. Education was another aspect of the observatory's work that Wood developed. Always one of its aims, increasing numbers of visitors, including teaching students, attended the observatory. These activities commanded respect for Sydney Observatory in astronomical circles, but its image in the NSW Parliament and associated Public Service remained forgettable. Wood's annual reports failed to help this. They did not communicate any sense of excitement and worth in the observatory. Disestablishment as a functioning observatory The disestablishment of the observatory echoed that of fifty years earlier when Cooke stressed the need for a new location. The Chairman of the Board of Visitors wrote a letter to the Premier in 1979 urging the establishment of a remote observing site for the observatory and stressing the difficulty of the conditions at the existing site. This coincided with a nationwide review of astronomy facilities commissioned by the ASA and led by Monash University Professor of Astronomy Kevin Westfold (1980) This concluded that astronomy was a federal responsibility and that resources should be allocated to research operations, highlighting radio astronomy. It should also be noted that the State of NSW was in financial difficulties. This, and likely other pressures, resulted in a letter from the Premier in June 1982 announcing his decision to transfer the observatory to the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences and discontinue scientific work. Despite letters from international astronomers, and a concerted offort from now-retired Harley Wood, the Government did not rescind its decision. In July 1984 the Minister for Public Works, Ports and Roads announced an $800,000 project to restore Sydney Observatory for astronomy education, public observatory and a Museum of Astronomy. While the importance of the exterior was recognised, the interior was less fortunate. Work inside the building in the creation of the museum involved the staged removal of almost all instruments, equipment, and furniture and furnishings to the Museum's store. The astrographic building was demolished and the dome, instruments and most of the glass plate and paper collection was removed to Macquarie University for future research use. In 1997 the observatory was refurbished, this time instruments were returned to their original locations or showcased. 'The \\"By the light of the Southern Stars\\" exhibition theme also included the Parramatta Observatory instruments and Indigenous Astronomy. In 1999 a major stonemasonry repair project on the observatory building commenced. This continued through to 2008. In 2002 the conservation plan was updated by Kerr, this time complimentary on the relocation and interpretation of the instruments. A number of key astronomical events have occurred in recent years, most notable are Halleys Comet (1986), The impact of Shoemaker Levy on Jupiter (1994), Mars at its closest encounter (2003), transits of Venus (2004, 2012), Comet McNaught (2007), planetary alignments and eclipses. Thousands of people came to the observatory to view these through telescopes and to see relevant exhibitions. Further the observatory provided information about these events to many more people either directly or through the media. In 2008, for the 150th anniversary, the Signal Station building was stabilised, one of the original two flagstaffs re-constructed and an archaeological investigation commenced around the base of the fort led by NSW Government Architects, building design and Heritage office and Casey and Lowe. Original fort footings were uncovered and the base of a room which was once a bombproof inside the fort wall foundations. In 2009 permission was granted for a temporary marquee to be erected for a restricted period of time in order to raise funds. Furthermore, the Astrographic dome and instruments have been returned by Macquarie University to the Museum store where they are awaiting conservation and a Heritage NSW approved structure on the observatory site. The most significant change to Sydney Observatory in 50 years, the new Eastern Dome was opened on 27 January 2015, by the Deputy Premier Troy Grant and Minister for Disability Services, John Ajaka. =Georg Merz and Sons, vintage 7.25-inch refracting telescope= Located at the Sydney Observatory is a vintage 7.25-inch refracting telescope on an Equatorial mount that was manufactured by the German company Georg Merz and Sons between 1860 and 1861. The 7.25-inch Merz refracting telescope arrived at Sydney Observatory, Sydney, Australia, in 1861.  Description  The observatory is a sandstone two- storey building in the Italianate style. There are two telescope domes on octagonal bases and a four-storey tower for the time-ball. The 1858 building designed by the Colonial Architect, Alexander Dawson, comprised a dome to house the equatorial telescope, a room with long, narrow windows for the transit telescope, an office for calculations, and a residence for the astronomer. A western wing was added in 1877 with office and library space and a second dome for another telescope. Some of the first astronomical photographs of the southern sky were taken at the observatory, under the direction of Henry Chamberlain Russell. The observatory also took part in the compilation of the first atlas of the whole sky, The astrographic catalogue. The part completed at Sydney took over 70 years, from 1899 to 1971, and filled 53 volumes. The observatory once contained offices, instruments, a library and an astronomer's residence. It is now a public observatory and a museum of astronomy and meteorology. The building is of Florentine Renaissance style and the storeys are divided by string courses while articulated quoins at corners, stone bracketed eaves and entablatures to openings of the residence contribute to the fine stone masonry work. A single storey wing to the north has had a timber balcony verandah with a stone balustrade built above. Windows are of twelve pane type and the doors are six panels. The physical condition is good. Observatory Hill affords superb views of Sydney Harbour and the bridge. = Modifications and dates = *1796First windmill built on hill. *1796-7to crush grain - abandoned 1806. *1800At least two six-pounder cannons located on hill. *1804Commencement of construction of Fort Phillip as protection versus convict uprising.

Its dominant location beside and above the port town and, later, City of Sydney made it the site for a range of changing uses, all of which were important to, and reflected, stages in the development of the colony. These uses included: milling (the first windmill); defence (the first, and still extant, fort fabric); communications (the flagstaffs, first semaphore and first electric telegraph connection); astronomy, meteorology and time keeping. The surviving structures, both above and below ground, are themselves physical documentary evidence of 195 years' changes of use, technical development and ways of living. As such they are a continuing resource for investigation and public interpretation. The place has an association with an extensive array of historical figures most of whom have helped shape its fabric. These include: colonial Governors Hunter, Bligh, Macquarie & Denison; military officers and engineers Macarthur; Barrallier; Bellasis and Minchin; convicts: the as yet unnamed constructors of the mill and fort; architects: Greenway (also a convict), Lewis, Blacket, Weaver, Dawson and Barnet; signallers and telegraphists such as Jones and the family Moffitt; astronomers: particularly PP King, Scott, Smalley, Russell, Cooke and Wood. The elevation of the site, with its harbour and city views and vistas framed by mature Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) trees of the surrounding park, make it one of the most pleasant and spectacular locations in Sydney. The picturesque Italianate character and stylistic interest of the observatory and residence building, together with the high level of competence of the masonry (brick and stone) of all major structures on the site, combine to create a precinct of unusual quality; Finally, the continued use of the observatory for astronomical observations and the survival of astronomical instruments, equipment (Appendix 4) and some early furniture (Appendix 3), although temporarily dispersed, and the retention of most interior spaces, joinery, plasterwork, fireplaces, and supports ensure that the observatory can remain the most intact and longest serving early scientific building in the State. Also of significance for relationship of Commonwealth and State powers. Site of the first intercolonial conference on meteorology and astronomy. An excellent example of a Colonial building erected for scientific purposes and continuing to perform its function at the present time. The structure makes an imposing composition atop the historic hill originally known as Flagstaff Hill and occupies the historic Fort Phillip site (1804‚Äì45). Designed by the colonial architect Alexander Dawson and built in 1858.AHC Sydney Observatory was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.

Lysine degradation is also affected in this disorder leading to hyperlysinemia. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an individual must inherit mutations in NADK2, located at 5p13.2 from both of their parents. NADK2 encodes the mitochondrial NAD kinase. A defect in this enzyme leads to deficient mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels. 2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase, but also lysine degradation are performed by NADP-dependent oxidoreductases explaining how NADK2 deficiency can lead to multiple enzyme defects. 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency was initially described in 1990 based on a single case of a black female who presented with persistent hypotonia. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated lysine, low levels of carnitine and an abnormal acylcarnitine profile in urine and blood. The abnormal acylcarnitine species was eventually identified as 2-trans,4-cis- decadienoylcarnitine, an intermediate of linoleic acid metabolism. The index case died of respiratory failure at four months of age. Postmortem enzyme analysis on liver and muscle samples revealed decreased 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity when compared to normal controls. A second case with failure to thrive, developmental delay, lactic acidosis and severe encephalopathy was reported in 2014. 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency was included as a secondary condition in the American College of Medical Genetics Recommended Uniform Panel for newborn screening. Its status as a secondary condition means there was not enough evidence of benefit to include it as a primary target, but it may be detected during the screening process or as part of a differential diagnosis when detecting conditions included as primary target. Despite its inclusion in newborn screening programs in several states for a number of years, no cases have been identified via neonatal screening.

Cristea (31 January 1909 - 6 July 1995) is considered by many to be Romania's best racing driver, winner of the 1936 Monte Carlo Rally. Cristea was born in Bucharest, Romania. Having a passion for motor vehicles, he forged his ID card in 1925 and obtained his driving licence even though he was only 16 and a half. He started racing in 1930 and entered his first Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo in 1931, finishing 11th with his team mate, driving a Dodge Victory Six. He pursued his driving career in parallel with joining the Bucharest Polytechical University, of which he dropped out after 3 years for medical reasons. He entered the 1934 and 1935 Monte Carlo Rallies, finishing 18th and 15th driving a modified Ford V8 in both rallies. After these progresses, Cristea, together with Ionel Zamfirescu, a motorcycling champion, decided to modify a Ford V8 in order to attempt a top finish in the 1936 Monte Carlo Rally. To help him, Ford Romania gave him an already competitive Ford V8, which he heavily tuned up: he only kept from the original car the radiator's mask, the engine hood, the headlights, the fenders, the windshield and the dashboard. He modified the engine, which received a British-made cylinder head which reduced the compression ratio, he replaced the Delco ignition with a Vertex-Scintila magneto and replaced the stock carburettor with a double Weber carburettor taken from Maserati, he reinforced the chassis, changed the shocks with some Lincoln provenance, more rigid shocks, obtained a rigid transmission by obtaining the current effect of the limited slip differential and transformed the car's body into a roadster's body. When the car was finished, he stated that he couldn't possibly take any more weight off his car. Together with his team mate Ionel Zamfirescu and his mechanic Gogu Constantinescu he started the rally from Athens and arrived to Monte Carlo without accumulating any penalty points (like other 15 crews). The winner was going to be selected after a slalom contest, which Cristea won 0.4 seconds ahead of Frenchman Laury Schell, driving a more powerful Delahaye. This was Ford's first win at Monte Carlo and Romania's only victory in the Principality. The following year, he won the Monte Carlo Rally, but he was disqualified because his back fenders were illegal (they did not fully covered the wheels). In 1939, he won a sports car event at the N√ºrburgring in Germany. In the post-war period, Cristea only competed in local races and hillclimbing events in Romania. During his career, he raced in 80 competitions (of which 35 were international ones) and had 56 podium finishes (30 wins, 20 second places and 6 third places). After ending his driving career, he founded the Autoturism (Car) magazine in 1969, today owned by the Romanian Auto Club and wrote several reference books including Cum sa devii campion (How to Become a Champion), Arta de a conduce automobilul (The Art of Driving The Car), Practica automobilului (The Practice of Car), Motorul de automobil (The engine of the automobile). He also wrote Dictionar tehnic auto in 7 limbi (Dictionary of Automotive Terms in 7 Languages - English, French, German, Italian, Romanian, Russian and Spanish) with Carol Szabados. Practica automobilului a best seller, was published in four editions; the book is recognized as the \\"bible\\" of the Romanian automotive technology and is widespread in many libraries of automotive enthusiasts. He died in Bucharest on 6 July 1995, aged 89.

Currently, he is a baseball player agent. Frye played in Major League Baseball with the Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Colorado Rockies for all or part eight seasons between and . He was listed as tall, and he thew and batted right-handed. Born in Oakland, California, he graduated from high school in Panama, Oklahoma, and played college baseball at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. Career Frye was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 30th round of the 1988 amateur draft and made his big league debut with them on July 9, 1992, at Arlington Stadium during a 14‚Äì4 Rangers victory over the Cleveland Indians. Frye went 2-for-3, including a triple, walk, RBI and three runs, as the starting second baseman and leadoff hitter. His first career home run came July 24, 1992, off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Arthur Rhodes at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He missed the 1993 season due to injury. In 1996, after hitting just .238 in 49 games with the Rangers' American Association affiliate Oklahoma City 89ers, Frye was released. That same day, June 5, he was signed as a free agent with the Red Sox. He had a career year in 1997 when he hit .310 with 6 home runs in 127 games. He missed the entire 1998 season due to an injured left knee but returned for the 1999 season, playing in 47 games. Frye became a bench player when the Red Sox signed second baseman Jos√© Offerman prior to the 1999 season and, on July 27, 2000, was traded to the Colorado Rockies with Brian Rose and John Wasdin in exchange for Rolando Arrojo, Rick Croushore and Mike Lansing. On December 11, 2000, he signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 3, 2001 at a game in the SkyDome, aphids were in the ballpark causing him to wear a mask on his face for the whole game. He made history on August 17, 2001, when he became only the second Blue Jay in history to hit for the cycle. The only other Blue Jays player to hit for the cycle was Kelly Gruber, who happened to be in attendance that day. Frye's final big league appearance came September 20, 2001, as he pinch-hit for catcher Darrin Fletcher in the 8th inning of a 12‚Äì6 loss to the Orioles.

The four-engine propeller-driven airplane crashed at 1:41 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on June 17, 1948 outside of Aristes, Pennsylvania, killing all 4 crew members and 39 passengers on board. Accident sequence Flight 624 from San Diego had just completed a routine initial descent as part of its approach into the New York area, when the forward cargo hold fire indicator light illuminated, leading the flight crew to believe there was a fire in that cargo hold. Although this later turned out to be a false alarm, the crew decided to discharge bottles into the forward cargo hold, to try to extinguish the possible fire. While proper operating procedure called for opening the cabin pressure relief valves prior to discharging the bottles, to allow for venting of the gas buildup in the cabin and cockpit, there was no evidence the crew opened the relief valves. Consequently, the released gas seeped back into the cockpit from the front cargo hold and apparently partially incapacitated the flight crew. The crew then put the aircraft into an emergency descent, and as it descended lower it hit a high voltage power line, bursting into flames, then smashing through the trees of a wooded hillside. Notable victims Among the passengers were Broadway theatre impresario Earl Carroll and his girlfriend, actress Beryl Wallace, plus Henry L. Jackson, men's fashion editor of Collier's Weekly magazine and co-founder of Esquire Magazine. An interesting item discovered in the wreckage was a script of Garry Moore's Take It or Leave It show broadcast at the time each Sunday night over NBC, but an NBC spokesman in New York said he was \\"certain\\" Moore was not on the plane. Investigation and final report The Civil Aeronautics Board investigated the crash and published a narrative describing the following sequence of events in its final report: > The airplane, named Mainliner Utah, arrived in Chicago at 09:52 en route > from Los Angeles to New York. After a 52-minute turnaround, the DC-6 > departed for New York. The airplane climbed en route to its planned altitude > of 17,000 feet.

The former Lamprophis capensis, brown or Cape house snake, has been assigned to the genus Boaedon, as Boaedon capensis. Geographic range House snakes are found throughout all of sub- Saharan Africa in a wide variety of habitats; some species are well adapted to living in burrows. They are named \\"house\\" snakes as they are frequently found around human dwellings, feeding on the rodents that congregate around human waste. They are extremely adaptable snakes, which are found in scrubland, woodland, savannah, and montane regions. Behaviour and diet Wild house snakes are often very nervous, but are not prone to biting. Their first defensive reaction is to flee. They are frequently found in and around human dwellings, where they consume rodents, small lizards, and even birds. House snakes are prolific breeders and lay clutches averaging eight to 12 eggs that hatch after around two months of incubation. Hatchlings are typically around 20 cm long. In captivity African house snakes are common in the exotic pet trade. The primary species available is B. capensis, with the others being harder to acquire. They are easy to care for and breed readily. Their popularity has declined in recent years due to more interestingly colored snakes, like the corn snake. Despite this, captive breeding of house snakes for color and pattern continues. Few are exported from Africa due to their low market value and the ease of breeding them in captivity. They can live up to 20 years with proper care. Males are smaller than females and seldom grow longer than . Females can attain lengths of , and specimens from the eastern region of southern Africa (KwaZulu-Natal) are reported to reach lengths of or more. These snakes are nocturnal. The female lays one clutch of 9 to 16 eggs in early spring. They are known to store sperm and lay up to six clutches per year in captivity, but it rarely happens in nature. Hatchlings are upon hatching. Diet Their main diet consists of rodents; in captivity, smaller snakes take pinkie mice, and in the wild they more commonly prey on geckos until they are powerful enough to constrict mice. Large females are known to occasionally eat weanling rats. Adult snakes get fed weekly. Hatchlings may eat small lizards, such as skinks and geckos, and newborn mice. In captivity, they can successfully be fed on gecko tails. Larger specimens are also known to take lizards, and in rare cases they will catch small bats. House snakes should be fed alone; their often violent feeding response may cause cannibalism.

People with this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that helps break down proteins containing the amino acid leucine. This condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide. Presentation Infants with this disorder appear normal at birth but usually develop signs and symptoms during the first year of life or in early childhood. The characteristic features of this condition, which can range from mild to life-threatening, include feeding difficulties, recurrent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, excessive tiredness (lethargy), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). If untreated, this disorder can lead to delayed development, seizures, and coma. Early detection and lifelong management (following a low-protein diet and using appropriate supplements) may prevent many of these complications. In some cases, people with gene mutations that cause 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency never experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. The characteristic features of this condition are similar to those of Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections. Genetics The MCCC1 and MCCC2 genes make protein subunits that come together to form an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. This enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for the fourth step in processing leucine. If a mutation in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene reduces or eliminates the activity of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, the body is unable to process leucine properly. As a result, toxic byproducts of leucine processing build up to harmful levels, damaging the brain and nervous system. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Screening It is one of the 29 conditions currently recommended for newborn screening by the American College of Medical Genetics. Treatment Symptoms can be reduced through avoidance of leucine, an amino acid. Leucine is a component of most protein-rich foods; therefore, a low-protein diet is recommended. Some isolated cases of this disorder have responded to supplemental biotin; this is not altogether surprising, consider that other biotin-related genetic disorders (such as biotinidase deficiency and holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency) can be treated solely with biotin. Individuals with these multiple carboxylase disorders have the same problem with leucine catabolism as those with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency.

The station is owned by Connecticut College Community Radio, Inc. and is operated by students and members of the community. The station features eclectic musical genres that are less often heard on the majority of radio stations. History WCNI was originally an on-campus AM radio station broadcast to Connecticut College students and staff via low-power carrier current transmitters placed in college dormitories and facilities. The presence of the station encouraged engagement in media arts, although the quality of its signal was typically poor and its interference with the broadcast signal of New York City's WNBC led to students sometimes turning off the transmitters in their dormitories. The station filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 10, 1972 for 89.9 MHz. A series of opposition letters were filed by WGAL Television, Inc., owner of WTEV/6 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, so Connecticut College modified their request to 91.5 MHz on May 10, 1973. A construction permit was finally granted on October 3, 1973 to allow WCNI to transmit on 91.5 MHz.WCNI's F.C.C. history card file; retrieved April 26, 2018. The application was filed by the Connecticut College Broadcast Association, Inc., a non-profit corporation established to limit the college's liabilities from the station's broadcasts to the general public. The call sign was assigned by the FCC on March 11, 1974.WCNI's F.C.C. history card file; retrieved April 26, 2018. In 1974, WCNI made its debut on 91.5 MHz with ten watts of transmission power, one of a wave of college radio stations introduced in that era using low-power FM transmission facilities. Early station promotional spots created by student and staff member Ken Abel hailed it as having \\"less power than a common light bulb.\\" Subsequent increases in transmission power led to a reassignment of its frequency to 91.1 MHz and eventually to the current 90.9 MHz. The original antenna tower for FM transmissions was erected atop Bill Hall on the Connecticut College campus using a World War II air raid siren tower as its base, modified by Connecticut College maintenance staff to hold a steel pipe which acted as an antenna mast. The antenna was subsequently relocated to a professionally installed tower next to the Crozier-Williams student center on the Connecticut College campus, adjacent to the station's studios and recording archives. Early broadcasts of the FM radio station were wide-ranging, including a variety of music genres, old radio serial dramas, local history, and live performances. To raise funds for government-mandated emergency broadcast equipment, the station held its first on-air fund raising marathon in the spring of 1975. The early FM broadcast signal of WCNI was not strong, but the station had a notable body of off-campus listeners in the New London area and its on-air staff included non- student members from the community. The station's proximity to the U.S. Navy submarine base across the Thames River in Gales Ferry, Connecticut and to the General Dynamics submarine manufacturing facility in Groton led to its nickname \\"Ground Zero Radio\\", in recognition of the region's presumed high priority as a Soviet nuclear strike site.Hartford Radio History's entry for WCNI; retrieved April 26, 2018.

Whitcher may have been the first significant woman prose humorist in the United States. Family life Frances was born November 1, 1811 in Whitestown, Oneida County, New York. She was the daughter of Lewis Berry. She lived a fairly sheltered life, and was very close to her family. She was often ill, but managed to find the ridiculous in everyday life. On January 6, 1847, at the age of 35, she married Rev. Benjamin Williams Whitcher, and in the Spring of that year moved with her new husband to Elmira, New York where he became the Rector of Trinity Church in April 1847. She had to put herself more into the public eye as a minister's wife. She died January 4, 1852 in Whitestown, New York. Material Whitcher's keen observations of those around her were an unending source of materials for her sketches. Those she wrote about soon saw themselves in her prose, and this caused friction with her husband's parishioners. This may have caused him to lose his position in the church. Characters She contributed poems to the Saturday Gazette and Godey's Lady's Book during the 1840s. Her humorous creation, The Widow Bedott, made her a celebrity. The characters she developed helped her satirize gentility, including issues such as fashion, social status, courtship, and hypocrisy. In 1855, The Widow Bedott Papers, was gathered from her writings and published in book form, featuring her chief character, the comic fool The Widow Bedott. Afterwards, David R. Locke fashioned a coarsely amusing play from it. Consult the memoir by M. L. W. Whitcher in Frances M. Whitcher's Widow Spriggins (New York, 1867).

History In 1833 Johann Rudolf Ringier purchased a printing plant in the Swiss town of Zofingen and began by printing regional gazettes and school curriculums. The small workshop soon evolved into a national newspaper-publishing house. Schweizer Illustrierte was first published in 1911 using letterpress.Offizielle Website der Schweizer Illustrierten. It was Switzerland's most successful people magazine and remains so to this day. Ten years later the equivalent for French-speaking Switzerland L‚ÄôIllustr√© was launched. Between 1948 and 1994 Ringier published comic stories of Ringgi and Zofi. In 1959 Ringier took the Swiss public by surprise launching the country's first tabloid, Blick.[2] With SonntagsBlick appeared the first Sunday Paper in 1969 on the market. In 1974, Hans Ringier founded the first journalism school in Switzerland. In 1977 Schweizerische Allgemeine Volkszeitung became Gl√ºckspost.Entstehung der Gl√ºcksPost. The Ringier-Pressehaus in Zurich Seefeld was opened in 1978. In the 1970s, the Swiss Ringier AG acquired the Munich publisher ‚ÄúHeering-Verlag‚Äù and changed the name to ‚ÄúRingier Deutschland GmbH‚Äù (Ringier Germany). The publishing house primarily focused on photography for books and magazines. Ringier Germany employed around 100 people and published eight monthly magazines plus special editions (e.g. Globo, Kundenmagazin BMW, fotoMagazin). In 2001 Ringier Germany closed its doors. In 2004, Ringier Publishing GmbH in Berlin launched the magazine Cicero and thus returned to the German market.¬´Cicero¬ª ‚Äì Ringier kehrt nach Deutschland zur√ºck. In: swissinfo.ch. 25. M√§rz 2004.

It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift by his brother - participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent. The Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, but had middling box- office returns compared with its budget and the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven (1995). Plot Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, is estranged from his ex-wife and his younger brother, Conrad. He is haunted by having seen his father commit suicide on his father's 48th birthday. For Nicholas's own 48th birthday, Conrad presents Nicholas with an unusual gift‚Äîa voucher for a game offered by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Conrad promises that it will change his life. Nicholas has doubts about CRS, but he meets fellow bankers who enjoyed the game. He goes to the CRS offices to apply and is irritated by the lengthy and time-consuming series of psychological and physical examinations required. He is later informed that his application has been rejected. Soon Nicholas begins to believe that his business, reputation, finances, and safety are at risk. He encounters a waitress, Christine, who appears to have been endangered by the game. Nicholas contacts the police, but they find the CRS offices abandoned. Eventually, Conrad appears at Nicholas's house and apologizes, claiming he has come under attack by CRS. With no one else to turn to, Nicholas finds Christine's home. He discovers she is a CRS employee and her apartment was fake. Christine says they are being watched. Nicholas attacks a camera, and armed CRS personnel swarm the house and fire upon them. Nicholas and Christine flee. Christine tells him CRS has drained his bank accounts using the psychological tests to guess his passwords. Panicking, Nicholas calls his bank, gives a verification code and is told his balance is zero. He realizes she has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, she admits she is part of the scam and he made a fatal mistake saying his verification code. Nicholas wakes entombed alive in a cemetery in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to return to the US, where he finds his mansion foreclosed and most of his possessions removed. He is told Conrad has been committed to a mental institution due to a nervous breakdown. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect, he discovers Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who conducted his tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. He locates Feingold and forces him to find the real CRS office. He takes Christine hostage and demands to be taken to the head of CRS. Attacked by CRS guards, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door. The guards begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells him it is a part of the game, his finances are intact, and his family and friends are waiting on the other side of the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge‚ÄîConrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated over accidentally killing Conrad, Nicholas leaps off the roof but lands on a giant air cushion. He is greeted by Conrad, who is alive, and the rest of the people from the game; everything had been staged. Conrad tells him this is his birthday present and that he arranged it to help Nicholas become a better person and embrace life. After a birthday party with friends, Christine declines Nicholas's offer for a date as she has another job in Australia. She offers instead to have coffee with him at the airport.

It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, who put the project in turnaround, where it was picked up by Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was originally attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct.Swallow 2003, p. 92. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a \\"fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a Mission: Impossible situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting\\". He said in an interview that his film differs from others of that kind because \\"movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information\\". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about \\"loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close to your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'\\"Swallow 2003, p. 91. More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.Swallow 2003, p. 94. =Casting= Fincher intended to make The Game before Seven, but when Brad Pitt became available for Seven, that project became top priority. The success of Seven helped the producers of The Game get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production. At the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, PolyGram announced that Jodie Foster would be starring in the film with Douglas.Swallow 2003, p. 93. However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting an actor and movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After talking to her, he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, Douglas didn't like the idea and requested it to change the character to his sister, which Foster found peculiar as Douglas is almost 20 years her senior and also appeared with her in Napoleon and Samantha, when Foster was 9 years old while Douglas was 28. Due to differences in opinions and also scheduling conflicts with Robert Zemeckis' Contact, Foster could not appear in the film. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to Jeff Bridges but he declined and Sean Penn was cast instead. Later, Foster alleged that she and PolyGram had orally agreed that she would appear in the film and when this did not transpire, she took out a $54.5 million lawsuit against the company. Deborah Kara Unger's audition for the role of Christine was a test reel consisting of a two-minute sex scene from David Cronenberg's Crash. Douglas thought it was a joke but when he and Fincher met her in person, they were impressed by her acting. =Filming= Principal photography began on location in San Francisco, despite studio pressure to shoot in Los Angeles which was cheaper. Fincher also considered shooting the film in Chicago and Seattle, but the former had no mansions that were close by and the latter did not have an adequate financial district. The script had been written with San Francisco in mind and he liked the financial district's \\"old money, Wall Street vibe\\". However, that area of the city was very busy and hard to move around in. The production shot on weekends in order to have more control. Fincher utilized old stone buildings, small streets and the city's hills to represent the class system pictorially. To convey the old money world, he set many scenes in restaurants with hardwood paneling and red leather. Some of the locations used in the film included Golden Gate Park, the Presidio of San Francisco, and the historic Filoli Mansion, 25 miles south of San Francisco in Woodside, California, which stood in for the Van Orton mansion. For the visual look of Nicholas' wealthy lifestyle, Fincher and the film's cinematographer Harris Savides wanted a \\"rich and supple\\" feel and took references from films like The Godfather which featured visually appealing locations with ominous intentions lurking under the surface.Swallow 2003, p. 102. According to Fincher, once Nicholas left his protective world, he and Savides would let fluorescents, neon signs and other lights in the background be overexposed to let \\"things get a bit wilder out in the real world\\". For The Game, Fincher employed a Technicolor printing process known as ENR which lent a smoother look to the night sequences. The challenge for him was how much deception could the audience take and \\"will they go for 45 minutes of red herrings?\\"Swallow 2003, p. 103. To this end, he tried to stage scenes as simply as possible and use a single camera because \\"with multiple cameras, you run the risk of boring people with coverage\\". The scene where Nicholas' taxi drives into the San Francisco Bay was shot near the Embarcadero, with the close-up of Douglas trapped in the back seat filmed on a soundstage at Sony Pictures Studios in a large tank of water.Swallow 2003, p. 95. The actor was in a small compartment that was designed to resemble the backseat of a taxi with three cameras capturing the action. Principal photography lasted 100 days with a lot of shooting done at night utilizing numerous locations.Swallow 2003, p. 96. Release The Game was released on September 12, 1997 in 2,403 theaters, grossing $14.3 million during its opening weekend. It went on to make $48.3 million in North America and $61.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $109.4 million. On September 18, 2012, The Criterion Collection released The Game on DVD and Blu-ray, making it spine #627 of the collection. They had originally issued the film on Laserdisc in 1997. Reception =Critical response= The film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 74% of 57 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average score is 7.32/10. The website's consensus reads: \\"The ending could use a little work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling.\\" Metacritic gives it a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as \\"the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times\\". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, \\"Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, that for a while the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, \\"It's formulaic, yet edgy. It's predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there's much pleasure in Fincher's intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense over long periods of time and his sense of humor\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B+\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game ‚Äî can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! ‚Äî but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact\\". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, \\"At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes\\". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that \\"Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied\\". =Retrospect= In retrospect, Michael Douglas said: David Fincher later admitted in interviews that he was not proud of the movie, explaining his working relationship with his wife, longtime producer Ce√°n Chaffin, the filmmaker said he picks her brain, and that they'll often disagree: =Literary assessment= In the Criterion edition film notes, the director was referred to as incorporating elements of the writings taken from Franz Kafka stating: =Accolades= A sequence from the film deemed to be the most thrilling was ranked #44 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

His Meteorologia philosophico-politica, in duodecim dissertationes per quaestiones meteorologicas & conclusiones politicas divisa, appositisque was first published in 1697. A third edition was published posthumously in 1709. His Meteorologia philosophico-politica is, as its title indicates, a meteorological, astrological, and political compendium.

His 12 dissertations are subdivided into 84 \\"questions.\\" These questions not only consider various natural phenomena but also the application of appropriate political policy and behavior in reaction to them. Thus, in his examination on comets, which deals with the appearance of every notable comet from 1500 to 1688, Reinzer discusses the predicted political upheavals and other political events that came in their wakes, and asks that Joseph be a wise and just ruler.

The enzyme is bound to adenosylcobalamin, a hormonal derivative of vitamin B12 in order to function. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency is caused by genetic defect in the MUT gene responsible for encoding the enzyme. Deficiency in this enzyme accounts for 60% of the cases of methylmalonic acidemia. Symptoms People with methylmalonyl CoA mutase deficiency exhibit many symptoms similar to other diseases involving inborn errors of metabolism. Newborn babies experience with vomiting, acidosis, hyperammonemia, hepatomegaly (enlarged livers), hyperglycinemia (high glycine levels), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Later, cases of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia can occur. In some cases intellectual and developmental disabilities, such as autism, were noted with increased frequency in populations with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency. Causes While methylmalonic acidemia has a variety of causes, both genetic and dietary, methylmalonyl CoA mutase deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Patients suffering from the deficiency either have a complete gene lesion, designated as mut0 or a partial mutation in the form of a frameshift designated as mut-. This frameshift affects the folding of the enzyme rendering its binding domain less effective. Patients with a complete deletion suffer an inactivation of methylmalonyl CoA mutase and exhibit the most severe symptoms of the deficiency, while patients with a partial mutations have a wide range of symptoms. Over 49 different mutations have been discovered for the MUT gene, yet only two appear in any discernible frequency. Enzymatic activity Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and uses a B12 derived prosthetic group, adenosylcobalamin, in order to accomplish this transfer. The enzyme is a homodimer, located in the mitochondrial matrix. The enzyme is 750 amino acids long, with the a metal ligand binding region to bind to the Cobalt region of adenosylcobalamin. The enzyme works by cleaving the adenosylcobalamin C-Co(III) bond, giving the carbon and cobalt (III) atoms each an electron. The cobalt then fluctuates between its two oxidation states: Co(II) and Co(III). In this way the adenosylcobalamin works as a reversible free radical generator. The cobalt therefore donates an electron back to the methylmalonyl- CoA backbone in order to transfer the coenzyme A group. MUT's reaction mechanism Metabolic activity Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is essential to the degradation pathways of many molecules including amino acids, and odd-chain fatty acids. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase links the propionyl-CoA degradation byproduct of these macromolecules to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. For amino acid metabolism, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase works in the degradation pathways of isoleucine, threonine, valine, and methionine. These amino acids are degraded into propanoyl-CoA which is then further degraded into (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This substrate must be further metabolized by a very similar enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which converts the (S) form of methylmalonyl-CoA into the (R) form. This is finally transformed using methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. L-methionine is also metabolized through a longer superpathway (see Figure 2). After transformation to L-homocystein, it is combined with L-serine to make L-cystathione, which is hydrolyzed by cystathione gamma lyase to create 2-oxobutanoate. This substrate is transformed to propionyl-CoA and undergoes the same metabolism previously described for propionyl-CoA. The cholesterol superpathway follows the degradation of cholesterol down to various substrates, however only a couple of these biotransformed molecules see propionyl-CoA as a byproduct. The conversion of 3,24-dioxocholest-4-en-26-oyl- CoA to 2-oxochol-4-en-24-oyl-CoA sees the release of a propionyl-CoA molecule. Additionally, the conversion of 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-17-ol-22-oyl-CoA to androst-4-ene-3,17-dione release of a propionyl-CoA molecule. Finally, the degradation of (S)-4-hydroxy-2-oxohexanoate to pyruvate and propanal, in turn releases a propionyl-CoA substrate after the propanal is converted. All these propionyl-CoA substrates are converted to succinyl-CoA following the methylmalonyl pathway For amino acid metabolism, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase works in the degradation pathways of isoleucine, threonine, valine, and methionine. These amino acids are degraded into propanoyl-CoA which is then further degraded into (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This substrate must be further metabolized by a very similar enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which converts the (S) form of methylmalonyl-CoA into the (R) form. This is finally transformed using methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. L-methionine is also metabolized through a longer superpathway (see Figure 2). After transformation to L-homocystein, it is combined with L-serine to make L-cystathione, which is hydrolyzed by cystathione gamma lyase to create 2-oxobutanoate. This substrate is transformed to propanoyl-CoA and undergoes the same metabolism previously described for propanoyl-CoA. Odd chain fatty acids are also metabolized through the methylmalonyl pathway. The degradation of odd chain fatty acids releases Acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is then converted to succinyl-CoA, and both succinyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are interjected into the tricarboxylic acid cycle for continued production of reductant. Metabolic pathology Urea cycle colored. The final product of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity is succinyl-CoA which is a tricarboxylic acid cycle substrate. A side effect of excess methylmalonyl-CoA is an interruption of the enzymes responsible for other transformations earlier in the metabolism of propionyl- CoA, leading to propanoic acidemia as well. This, along with an excess of methylmalonyl-CoA leads to the depletion of ATP through oxidative stress and coenzyme A. This disrupts the biosynthesis of myelin, urea, and glucose. Specifically, excess methylmalonyl-CoA places oxidative stress on the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the urea cycle (such as ammonia-dependent- carbamoyl-phosphate synthase or CPS1), and inhibits its mechanism of action. The combination of inhibited urea synthesis and poor protein metabolism, as well as a weakly replenished tricarboxylic acid cycle contribute to the symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia. Diagnosis Several tests can be done to discover the dysfunction of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Ammonia test, blood count, CT scan, MRI scan, electrolyte levels, genetic testing, methylmalonic acid blood test, and blood plasma amino acid tests all can be conducted to determine deficiency. Treatment There is no treatment for complete lesion of the mut0 gene, though several treatments can help those with slight genetic dysfunction. Liver and kidney transplants, and a low-protein diet all help regulate the effects of the diseases.  Prognosis  Infant mortality is high for patients diagnosed with early onset; mortality can occur within less than 2 months, while children diagnosed with late-onset syndrome seem to have higher rates of survival. Patients suffering from a complete lesion of mut0 have not only the poorest outcome of those suffering from methylaonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, but also of all individuals suffering from any form of methylmalonic acidemia.

During that time, individuals and groups in the Garvagh area inevitably became involved or affected. =Post Troubles= The Garvagh and District Development Association- GADDA undertook a project to modernise the town in the late 1990s and early 2000s by installing new water mains, upgrading road surfaces, improving pedestrian surfaces, new street lighting, a new community building and a new toilet block, which were funded through various support channels: the Coleraine Borough Council, the Ireland Fund of America, the EU and the British Government. In August 2009, more than 20 windows in Catholic owned businesses including a public house, butchers‚Äô shop and cafe were smashed some time around 3am. Police investigated the attacks as sectarian hate crimes. In October 2018 a man was shot in the arms and legs and beaten with a bat in what the police said was a paramilitary- style attack. The intruders also chased and threatened to shoot his teenage daughter who had offered them her piggy bank money to leave her family alone. Places of interest *Garvagh Museum is a rural Folk Museum in the walled garden of Garvagh House, the former seat of the Canning family. George Canning was elevated to the peerage in 1818 and took the title, Baron Garvagh. This walled garden has historic links with Donnchadh √ì H√°msaigh (aka Denis Hampson) the great blind harper who lived in three centuries, being born in 1695 and dying in 1807. George Canning, Dr Bacon and Squire Gage bought Hampson's first harp while he lived in Garvagh. At the entrance to the museum there is a memorial to Hempson in the form of a granite pillar. This unique collection holds almost two thousand artefacts which trace the history of the Bann Valley from 3000 BC through to the first half of the 20th century.Discover Northern Ireland: Garvagh Museum, accessed 3 July 2017 *Garvagh Forest, the former estate of the Cannings covering over , is on the western outskirts of Garvagh. *The River Agivey flows through Garvagh.

Garvagh Public Elementary School, which was the Presbyterian school, was at the Southerly end of the town. Garvagh Youth Club now occupies the premises. The second school, which was known as the Canning Public Elementary School, was the Church of Ireland school, and was positioned where the Christian Workers Union Hall now stands. In 1947 an Education Act was passed, changing education in Northern Ireland. Public Elementary schools were to be called Primary Schools, with pupils transferring at 11+ to Intermediate schools, Grammar schools, and Technical schools. This change took some time, as schools had to be planned and built. Garvagh Intermediate school opened in 1953. The primary school population fell as a result. Both primary schools continued to operate for some time, but eventually the Canning Primary School closed. Primary Education continued in Garvagh Primary School, but as housing development took place, the school could not cope with the numbers. Temporary accommodation was given in Garvagh Orange Hall. In the grounds of Garvagh Intermediate School was the school, and Garvagh House, the former house of the Canning family, which contained some classrooms and flats for single female teachers. The house fell into disrepair over the years and was eventually demolished; in 1965 the County Londonderry Education Committee opened Garvagh Primary School on the site. In the early 1970s, increased enrolment due to the raising of school leaving age led to the Education Committee transferring the primary school buildings to the Intermediate school, and in April 1973 a new Garvagh Primary School opened. It was built on Ashe's Meadow. Where the gates are, was the site of the old cinema (AVON - which stood for Allies Victory over Nazis). The school was of a new design, with three wings. Each wing consisted of three classrooms, lavatories and an open area. Apart from the classroom for P1, the classrooms had no doors. This was referred to as open plan. Today, there are two schools in Garvagh: Garvagh Primary School, St Patrick's & St Joseph's Primary School (Glenullin). Garvagh High School closed on 31 August 2013 as a result of enrolment decline. In addition, the future of Garvagh Primary School is unclear as there are ongoing discussions regarding forming an amalgamation with Gorran Primary School, which lies just beyond the town vicinity. Garvagh was one of the first towns to provide early year education in the area. The preschool. Garvagh Community Playgroup was established in 1974. The playgroup currently resides behind Garvagh Primary School and provides early years education to children from 3 years old.

He observed that people's perceptions of products and services were directly related to aesthetic design, and named this relationship sensation transference. Cheskin spent most of his life investigating how design elements impacted people's perceptions of value, appeal, and relevance. He also discovered that most people could not resist transferring their feelings towards the packaging to the product itself. Based on consumer feedback, Cheskin recommended changing the colour of Jelke's Good Luck margarine from traditional white to yellow. Furthermore, he changed the wrapper material from waxed paper to foil to represent a higher quality product. These simple recommendations dramatically improved the product's sales, and are still in use for many margarine and dairy products.Louw, Alice, and Michelle Kimber. \\"The Power of Packaging.\\" The Customer Equity Company. web .

Evolution of marketing In the early 20th century, advertisers took a top-down approach to communicating value to customers. Customers were perceived as responding as a part of a group; their decisions were based on unknown psychological forces. This model mirrored Sigmund Freud's view of human psychology: interpretation of sensory input, such as a product image, was believed to derive from childhood experience, gender, and sexual desires. In the late 1940s, there were several consultants using this approach, then called motivational research, for market research based on psychological understanding. The first was probably the Bureau of Applied Social Research, founded by Paul Lazarsfeld in New York City. Though largely unsuccessful, it began the Institute for Motivation Research, founded by Lazarsfeld's student Ernest Dichter. Another public relations firm was Bernays & Co., founded by Edward Bernays. These two companies met success with their Freudian approach to marketing. Louis Cheskin had a contrasting approach. In the 1930s, he founded the Color Research Institute of America in Chicago, renamed Louis Cheskin Associates.Renamed 'Cheskin Research' after his death. He was one of the first marketers to use customer-centric methods, and to value direct customer input above marketers' expectations or guesses about customers' needs. An example of this contrasting approach comes from cigarette advertising. The Freudian approach posited that women smoked more when cigarette advertising showed uplifted, or erect, cigarettes in their hands and mouths because of their inherent penis envy. Cheskin reasoned that it could also be due to the idea of social acceptance and glamour projected by the advertisement. Cheskin employed the scientific method in marketing, testing his hypotheses of product acceptance by observing customers, which was a unique approach at the time. His methods focused on catering to what consumers felt, desired, and needed, rather than trying to directly manipulate those ideas. His methods also advocated frequent updates to the methodology used, as Cheskin's methods were based on ephemeral consumer attitudes rather than on Freudian psychology. By the 1950s, Cheskin had already implemented the concept that brands, messages, and offerings could be coordinated and delivered through multiple contexts and media. He relied on scientific testing procedures and detailed standards, including colour guides. One such standard was first to understand, then explain what companies had to offer in a way that customers understood. Use of color Published in 1951, Louis Cheskin's groundbreaking Color For Profit initiated a scientific approach to color and design. Cheskin's philosophy rotates around three core concepts: 1\\\\. Good taste has little to do with how well a design sells. 2\\\\. Asking customers what they think of a package design is not a useful way to measure effectiveness. Surveys and polls don't measure unconscious reactions; and what consumers do, not what they say, is what matters. Research shows that most people who claim advertising doesn't affect them tend to buy widely advertised products. 3\\\\. Colors have symbolic meanings: \\"We associate red with festivity, blue with distinction, purple with dignity, green with nature, yellow with sunshine. Pink is generally associated with health... White is a symbol of purity. Black expresses evil.\\" Preferences for pure colors are often associated with the poor. The rich tend to prefer tints. And while women generally prefer tints and men deep shades, both are attracted to fleshtones.\\" :From: The Louis Cheskin Animal Coloring Book by Jack Szwergold. Changing the face of Ford In researching the automobile market in 1957, Cheskin wrote a scathing prediction that the Edsel motor car would be a market flop because its styling did not portray a coherent aesthetic and reflect the changing trend toward modernism. Inversely, he predicted the massive success of the Ford Thunderbird. Experts of the time had made the opposite prediction based on the comparative size of the companies' advertising budgets. Though Henry Ford and the automotive industry initially denounced Cheskin's opinion, Ford subsequently included Cheskin in the Ford Falcon project after his forecast proved correct. While the Falcon project had progressed too far to make use of his research results, his new insights were incorporated into the Ford Mustang, one of Ford's most successful cars. Cheskin helped rigorously test the Mustang in experiential prototypes. Based on the success of the Mustang, in 1960 Ford brought Cheskin in to research and develop the Lincoln Continental, the country's first modernist 'luxury' car. Using his research techniques, Cheskin recommended a radically different advertising approach with the Continental's launch. He created the first magazine designed to sell a product for exclusive distribution through country clubs. Driving events at country clubs were also promoted. Initially, this approach relied almost exclusively on word of mouth and represented an early use of guerrilla marketing. Cheskin viewed these innovations as part of the process; natural extensions of his understanding of customer experience. In his view, there were no meaningful distinctions between advertising, price, packaging, product use, or the brand promotion. He approached these as an integrated whole. Ford's close involvement with Cheskin in their product development was also unusual for the times. Sensation transference Most people make unconscious assessments of a product, service, or event not only based on the item itself, but on secondary sensory input associated with the item, which all contribute to one general impression - whether intended or not, accurate or not. Cheskin called this \\"sensation transference\\". Cheskin's innovative insight was that impressions created in customers' minds, based on experiencing products sensorially, transferred directly to concepts of value, price, quality, and emotion. These, in turn, created and fulfilled expectations of satisfaction. Cheskin's research didn't always explain why these associations existed, but he confirmed that they did play an important role in both customer choice and satisfaction. Cheskin's work was not just focused on appearance. Often his research led to understanding that added value and changed the product or service offering in valuable ways. For example, initially McDonald's operated burger-stands designed for walk-up service. Cheskin's research showed that these configurations were uncomfortable for families, particularly women alone with their children, accounting for low sales to these customers. Cheskin was able to show that tables, chairs, and a semblance of walls helped these customers feel safe and comfortable visiting and eating on-site. Later, this understanding led to the transformation of the burger-stands into restaurants. Research on color use and imagery, too, led to the introduction of Ronald McDonald. It was these kinds of insights that Cheskin's research gave his clients that helped shape companies' strategies. Some results of Cheskin and his team's research include: * The adoption of the spoon on Betty Crocker packages (leading to a doubling of sales) * The consumer flop of the Edsel automobile was predicted in a legendary article Cheskin wrote before its introduction (triggering Henry Ford to hire him shortly afterward) * Uncovering the preference of American consumers for circles over triangles on packaging * Developing the first successful mainstream margarine (Imperial for Unilever) * The basic market research underlying the introduction of the Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental * The development of the Marlboro Man and Marlboro packaging from what was previously a women's cigarette * The creation of the Gerber Baby * Rounding the corners of the Fleishmann's Gin label to appeal more to women (who made up nearly 40% of liquor store shoppers) * The transformation in the mid-1950s of the Duncan Hines cake mix package toward a more 'colonial' style to reflect American consumers' desire for both newness and tradition * The retention of the Golden Arches by McDonald's, which he argued \\"had Freudian applications to the subconscious mind of the consumer and were great assets in marketing McDonald's food\\", and likened to \\"mother McDonald's breasts\\".\\"Brand iconography - the secret to creating lasting brands?\\", from Brand Strategy, February 20, 1999, archived and partially paywalled at Highbeam.com Cheskin's approach and successes won respect from corporate leaders at McDonald's, Ford, Polaroid, General Mills, and many others. Henry Ford, Walt Disney, and Ray Kroc personally engaged Cheskin on the basis of his innovative approach. One famous Cheskin study involved the testing of identical deodorants in different packages. Samples were mailed to users and told that the formulations were different. However, the only difference between them was their packaging (three different colour schemes). As one might expect from Cheskin's work, the trials showed that customers preferred one over the others. In fact, some perceived one of the samples as so threatening that they reported rashes and trips to dermatologists, yet had no trouble with the same formula in a different package. Imperial margarine In 1940 margarine wasn't popular in the United States. Consumers were not interested in eating or purchasing it and Cheskin was asked to find out why. At that time, though margarine was common, it was not associated with butter because of its texture and colour; it was white instead of yellow. The obvious solution was to add yellow colouring (where the law allowed), but that didn't mean that consumers would find it acceptable. In a truly innovative approach, Cheskin threw luncheons for housewives (sometimes in their homes), using this new colored margarine instead of butter, but not drawing attention to this fact. The luncheons included speakers and the food was only secondary. He asked the women to fill out questionnaires about the speaker, which also asked them to rate the food. By not drawing attention to the margarine and not conducting a typical focus group (which would do just that), Cheskin was able to test this new approach to margarine in a neutral environment. The results of this technique showed no real differences between people served butter and those served margarine. This conclusion alone was significant for the margarine industry. However, by conducting research indirectly, in the environment where the product would eventually be used (as opposed to a meeting room typical of focus groups), Cheskin lent credibility to the results. In addition, his multi-sensory and experiential approach of creating a full event around the test was truly innovative for the time. Further tests found ways of transferring the impression of quality, a known concern with this product. By delivering the margarine in blocks the same size as butter, wrapping them in foil, naming the margarine 'Imperial,' and using a crown logo, he was able to create a total experience, through product and packaging, that connoted quality to housewives of the time. Furthermore, when the company proclaimed 'It tastes just like Butter,' they had scientific 'proof' to back this statement up. The Marlboro Man Perhaps Cheskin's most famous achievement was turning Marlboro cigarettes into a 'man's' cigarette from its original appeal to women. Because more men than women were smokers, Cheskin convinced Phillip Morris that they would have more success by appealing to men. At the time its unique product differentiation was a red wrapper, to hide lipstick marks. Cheskin's recommendations were to redesign the package to denote masculinity, while keeping the red color. His recommendations underlie everything from the 'Man-Sized Flavor' advertising campaign and the now iconic packaging (resembling a medal), to the masculine and virile Marlboro Man himself. The Marlboro Man sported tattoos to give him a rugged backstory and often appeared as a cowboy on horseback (the predominant image that has survived today). Relevance to marketing today Though Cheskin's process was created and perfected in the 1950s and 1960s, it is just as relevant to marketing today as back then - more so, perhaps, with the rise in experiential branding and marketing. Indeed, market tests continue to confirm Cheskin's sensation transference phenomenon. The current evolution of Louis Cheskin's firm, Cheskin Added Value, continues to apply many of his foundational principals of design research and sensation transference to their work. Indeed, Cheskin's approach is enduring and has outlasted those of Dichter and Bernays - at least, theirs are not prominent nor accepted approaches in most marketing environments or business schools.

Following his release from prison, Clarkson co-founded an organization called the Patriot Network. He held tax protester meetings and sold books that claimed to teach individuals how to avoid paying taxes. 2004 sentencing In May 2004, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Clarkson had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and held that Clarkson was guilty of criminal contempt. He was sentenced to six months in jail. The sentence was suspended for five years, however, on three conditions: firstly, that Clarkson and the South Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel submit to the Court an agreed- upon disclaimer stating that Clarkson is not an attorney and is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina or in any other state; secondly, that Clarkson file an affidavit stating that the disclaimer has been prominently and permanently placed on any and all of his websites and on all literature authored and/or published by Clarkson; and thirdly, that Clarkson no longer engage in the unauthorized practice of law.In the Matter of Robert Barnwell Clarkson, Order No. 94 of 2004 (5/24/2004).

In 1973 she founded the organization COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics), which advocates decriminalization of prostitution. In 1999, she was instrumental in founding the St. James Infirmary Clinic, a medical and social service organization serving sex workers in San Francisco.  History  Margo St. James was born in Bellingham, Washington. She lived in the Haight-Ashbury during the Summer of Love in the mid-1960s and her home became an informal salon, living with her guitarist friend Steve Mann, hosting visitors such as Ken Kesey, Dr. John, Frank Zappa, members of comedic improvisational ensemble The Committee, and comedian and publisher Paul Krassner. In the late 1960s, she was the live-in housekeeper and chauffeur for Alan Watts, in Marin County.Summer of Love: 40 Years Later / Margot St. James, San Francisco Gate, Joel Selvin, May 20, 2007. Retrieved 23 April 2017. St. James founded COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) in 1973. The forerunner of COYOTE was WHO: Whores, Housewives and Others; Others in this case meant lesbians. The first meeting of WHO was held on Alan Watts's houseboat; and the name COYOTE came from novelist Tom Robbins who dubbed St. James the coyote trickster. St. James began attending international conferences: the United Nations Decade Face of Women Conferences in Mexico City, the 1976 Tribunal of Crimes Against Women in Brussels, the 1977 International Women's Year Conference in Houston, the 1977 Libertarian Party Convention, the 1980 Decade of Women Conference in Copenhagen, the 1976 Democratic National Convention in New York City‚Äîwhere St. James organized loiter-ins‚Äîand the Republican Convention in Kansas City. In 1974, St. James lectured at Harvard, among other campuses. In 1976, COYOTE, led by St. James, filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island. In the case, COYOTE v. Roberts, the argument was based on how much power the state should have to control the sexual activity of its citizens. The lawsuit also alleged discrimination on how the law was being applied. Data was submitted that demonstrated selective prosecution, the Providence Police were arresting female sex workers far more often than the male customers. St. James testified in the case. Although the case eventually was dismissed when the General Assembly changed the prostitution statute in 1980, COYOTE and St. James are given credit as one of the reasons prostitution in Rhode Island was decriminalized, prostitution was outlawed again in 2009 (see Prostitution in Rhode Island). Other documentaries detailing St. James's activism include Hard Work, directed by Ginny Durrin, Ain't Nobodies Business, and Hookers. Hard Work, which is set in Washington D.C., was filmed in 1976 during the Bicentennial. The short documentary won the NYC Golden Eagle Cine Award in 1978 and the Edinburgh, Scotland award for Best Documentary in 1979.Boyd, Dick. http://northbeachbook.com/MargotStJames.aspx St. James claims to be a former prostitute and has been criticized by the anti-pornography feminists, including Dorchen Leidholdt. Her claim to have been a prostitute is based on a 1962 prostitution conviction. According to St. James, her conviction was based on her knowledge of the word trick. From 1974 to 1979, COYOTE published its newsletter, COYOTE Howls, from St. James's office in San Francisco. Fund- raising involved an annual hosting of the well-attended Hooker's Ball, which nabbed 20,000 attendees in 1978. St. James sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in 1980. In 1985, COYOTE's records were archived at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, in the prestigious Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. In 1993, St. James returned from France, where she had organized for decriminalization internationally, and married journalist Paul Avery. Avery, who died in 2000, was best known for his investigation of the Zodiac Killer and Patricia Hearst cases. In 1996, St. James received 78,669 votes in her bid to become a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, finishing seventh in a race where the top six were seated. In the late 1990s, she served on the Board of Supervisors' Drug Abuse Advisory Board. In 1999, Margo St. James founded the St. James Infirmary Clinic in San Francisco to help provide health care to the sex worker community.  Personal  St. James was married to journalist Paul Avery, who gained fame while writing for the San Francisco Chronicle during the Zodiac Killer case. He was one of the leading reporters on the case, and at one point received a personal threat from the killer in the form of a greeting card. Avery and Margo St. James were married until his death on December 10, 2000 from emphysema on Orcas Island, Washington. As of 2013, St. James was still living on Orcas Island.

The differences may be marginal‚Äîor even great, in some cases. These differences reflect the great ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity that existed after the fall of the Roman Empire on the Italian peninsula. Different monastic traditions arose within the Roman Catholic Church throughout Italy, but at different places and at different times. Even a musical non-specialist can hear the difference, for example, between the straightforward tone production in the Ambosian chants from Milan and the chants from Benevento, which display a distinct \\"eastern\\" ornamental quiver in the voice, reflecting the vocal traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church. Yet, in spite of the differences, the similarities are great. In any event, the formal Gregorian chant was imposed throughout Italy by 1100, although the music of Greeks rites continued to be heard at various places on the peninsula, especially in those places which Byzantium had once held, such as Ravenna or in the southern peninsula, which had been a refuge for those Greeks fleeing the great Byzantine iconoclast controversies before the year 1000. Obviously, where Greek rites were practiced, the chants were sung in the Greek language and not in Latin, as they were in the Roman Catholic liturgy. =Music of the Trecento= Francesco Landini, the most famous composer of the Trecento, playing a portative organ (illustration from the Fifteenth-century Squarcialupi Codex)The Trecento, from about 1300 to 1420, was a period of vigorous activity in Italy in the arts, including painting, architecture, literature, and music. The music of the Trecento pioneered new forms of expression, especially in secular song and in the use of vernacular language, Italian. In these regards, the music of the Trecento may seem more to be a Renaissance phenomenon; however, the predominant musical language was more closely related to that of the late Middle Ages, and musicologists generally classify the Trecento as the end of the medieval era.Richard H. Hoppin, Medieval Music (New York, W.W. Norton & Co., 1978), pp. 433ff. =Secular music= Secular music before the year 1500 was largely the work of jongleurs, troubadours and mimes. This was the age of the great vernacularization of language in Italy‚Äîindeed, throughout Europe; that is, people started to write and sing songs in their native language, which was not Latin, but whatever brand of vernacular medieval neo-Latin was spoken in their area. Thus, Dante showed with the Divine Comedy in 1300 that the common language (his was called \\"Tuscan\\" and not \\"Italian\\" until as late as the 18th century) could be a vehicle for fine literature. Logically, that extended to the lyrics of the songs that people sang. Two points are worth mentioning in this regard: (1) we know much more about the words of songs than we know about the actual sound of the music. Words were written down with much more ease than melodies were notated. (See musical notation). Thus, we know that there was a vibrant troubador tradition in the 12th century in the Provence in their language and we know that 1000 miles away on the island of Sicily there was also a vibrant troubador tradition at the Hohenstaufen court of Frederick II, songs sung in the dialect of the people (very much influenced, for example, by Arabic), but it is conjecture as to exactly what either one sounded like. We only know that southern French folk music, today, sounds quite a bit different from Sicilian folk music. Since folk music is relatively conservative in that it resists rapid change, we may assume that at least some of the obvious differences in melody, scales and approach to vocalising that exist now, existed then. The call and response nature of much popular choral singing in the Middle Ages‚Äîthat is, a soloist singing a line that is then answered by a group‚Äîfound its way into medieval church music as a way of involving all members of the congregation. The complicated polyphonies of what is called the Ars Nova began to be heard in the 14th century and 15th century; popular items such as madrigals employed increasing dense overlays of different melodies sung at the same time, the point being to create an interwoven and euphonious texture of sound; this is NOT the same as harmony, the sounding of many notes together in order to form a chord. That is a later invention. Nevertheless, the move from the monophonic sounds of chants to the many simultaneous melodies of polyphony does represent a revolution in our musical perceptions: to wit, you can have more one thing sounding at the same time and still find it pleasant to listen to. =The Renaissance= Most people do not think of music when they hear the term Renaissance. Yet, in the same sense that architects, painters, and sculptors of the 16th century were paying tribute to the newly rediscovered values of classical Greece, poets and musicians of that period attempted to do the same thing. The years between 1500 and 1600 are the most revolutionary period in European musical history; it is the century in which harmony was developed and the century that gave birth to opera. These two developments are connected. Readers will have noted the move from the monophony of Gregorian chants to the complicated polyphonies of madrigals and other music of the few centuries before 1500. The next shift in musical perception involves a less common term: homophony; that is, the sounding of a harmonic chord or progression of chords, not meant to stand out, but which support an obvious melody on top of the harmony. The desire‚Äîperhaps need‚Äîfor homophonic music arose from a number of factors. First, there was a rejection of overly complicated polyphony of many different melodies running at the same time: second, a general, new musical aesthetic of the period, best summed up in the words of Leonardo da Vinci in 1500, who said that music was \\"the simultaneous conjunction of proportional parts\\"‚Äîthat is, the sounding together of notes based on simple arithmetic rations such as 2:1 (which produces the sound of an octave), 3:2 (which produces the sound of fifth), and 5:4 (which produces the sound of a major third). Thus, if you generate notes at 400, 600, 800, and 1000 cycles per second, you have all the notes of the simplest and most harmonious sound in our music‚Äîthe major chord. It really is that simple. (See Musical Acoustics.) Third on the list of factors that make the 16th century so important was the Renaissance desire to tell a story, to put people up on a small stage and have them sing songs about Greek mythology‚Äîthe tale of Orpheus, for example. That is difficult to do if everyone is singing a melody at the same time; thus, polyphony gave way to homophony, and early opera consisted of relatively simple melodies with texts about Greek mythology, sung in Italian and supported by simple harmonies. The important city in Italy in this development of music in the 16th century was Florence. (See also: Florentine Camerata, Vincenzo Galilei, Jacopo Peri, Claudio Monteverdi, Palestrina, Arcangelo Corelli.) Besides Florence, two other Italian cities are particularly worthy of mention in the period around 1600. There is somewhat of a friendly rivalry between advocates of the two cities as to which one is more important in the history of the development of music in Italy. Venice justly claims its place as the birthplace of commercial opera; Naples points to its own history of church-sponsored music conservatories, institutions that developed into \\"feeder-systems,\\" providing composers and performing musicians for much musical life in Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. (See also: Music of Venice and Music of Naples.) =17th century= The period from about 1600 to 1750 encompasses the Baroque era of music. Many important things happened in this period. One was a return to the melodic complexities of polyphony; however, the melodies ran within a modern, established system of harmony based on chords and major and minor scales. This latter element is an extension of the concept of homophonic music and allowed melodic complexity of any variance to rise to dominance over the importance of text. The struggle for dominance between text and music goes back to the music of the Greeks and is still going on in all forms of European art music and popular music. This new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion and invention of instrumental resources of the orchestra; the keyboard was extended in both directions; the making of instruments such as those by Stradivarius became a great industry in Cremona; and instrumental music started to develop as a separate \\"track,\\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the sonata and fugue. Well-known and influential musical figures from this time period in Italy include Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, Benedetto Marcello and Antonio Vivaldi, representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period. =18th century= From the early 18th century to the end of that century encompasses what historians call \\"classical music\\". (Note that this use of the term \\"classical\\" does not correspond to what non-historians mean when they say \\"classical music\\"‚Äîthat is, all opera and symphonic music, as opposed to \\"popular music\\".) The term \\"classical\\" is appropriate for this period of music in that it marks the standardization of musical forms such as the symphony and concerto. Thus the term \\"classical\\" is used in the Renaissance sense of classical Greek philosophy‚ÄîPlatonic form, the idea that things such as beauty exist eternally as ideals, and that the artist's job‚Äîin this case, the composer's job‚Äîis put form on that ideal. Thus, we have, for example, a symphony formalized as a standard work in four movements for orchestra, and so forth. The physical plant for composition and performance of music in Italy advanced greatly during this century. It is the period in which the great opera houses in Naples and Milano were built: the San Carlo Theater and La Scala, respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan‚Äîand then Italian‚ÄîComic opera. Important, too, is refinding of some sense of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Metastasio. Important Italian composers in this century are: Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Niccol√≤ Piccinni, Giovanni Paisiello, Luigi Boccherini, Domenico Cimarosa, Muzio Clementi, Luigi Cherubini, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Niccol√≤ Paganini. It is also the age in which \\"Italian music\\" became international, so to speak, with many of these Italian composers beginning to work abroad. =19th century= This is the century of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Romanticism in music is marked by many of the same characteristics that define that century's literature and painting: less attention to the formalities of classicism, more involvement of human passions such as love, heroism, courage, freedom, etc., all of which is a direct outgrowth of the humanism of the French Enlightenment. Italian opera tends to forsake the light-heartedness of the Comic opera for the more serious fare of Italian lyric Romanticsm. Although the ever-popular Rossini is certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of Bellini, Donizetti, and then, of course, for the last fifty years of the century by Giuseppe Verdi, the greatest musical icon in Italian history. It is also the time of the early career of Giacomo Puccini, perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music, and certainly the last one. Puccini is the bridge to the age of the new music of the 20th century. =20th century= Romanticism in all European music certainly held on through the turn of century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Other Italian Romantic composers‚Äîat least composers who continued to compose in the tonal traditions of Western music (as opposed to the new atonality and dissonances of post-World War I Europe‚Äîcomposers who \\"made it\\" into the 20th century include Arrigo Boito, Ruggiero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea, and Ottorino Respighi. Yet, it was inevitable that Italian composers would respond to the fading values of Romanticism and the cynicism provoked in many European artistic quarters by such things as World War I and such cultural/scientific phenomena as psychoanalysis in which‚Äîat least according to Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äî\\"all men have secret thoughts that would shame hell.\\" Romanticism‚Äîin spite of its lingering popularity with opera goers‚Äîdied in the First World War. Romantic music in Italy, however, cannot be said to have died under its own weight, as one might say of the overlong and over-orchestrated works of the late Romantic music in Germany that gave way to Minimalist music. But abstraction and atonality and, simply, \\"difficult\\" music did come to Italy after the death of Puccini. Among the most important Italian names in 20th-century music are Luciano Berio, Luigi Dallapiccola, Goffredo Petrassi and Luigi Nono.

Baltimore returned with two second quarter scores, a 62-yard Bruce Laird interception return for a touchdown and a 36-yard field goal by Toni Linhart. The halftime score was 10-7 in favor of Baltimore. The second half began with a scoring flurry. Dave Casper scored on an 8-yard touchdown reception on Oakland's first drive of the half. Marshall Johnson of the Colts then returned the ensuing kickoff 87 yards for a matching touchdown. Ted Hendricks blocked a third-quarter Baltimore punt, setting up a 10-yard Stabler-to-Casper touchdown pass, which made the score 21-17 in favor of the Raiders.

Stabler connected with Clarence Davis for a first-down at the Raiders' 44-yard line.

On NFL's Greatest Games, Madden explained Casper's job on the play was normally to draw away the opposing team's safeties so the receivers could make a catch, but Flores had noticed the safeties had been playing closer to the line of scrimmage than usual, which is what prompted Flores to tell Stabler to look for Casper downfield. Casper himself claimed that although it was one of the team's most effective plays, he didn't recall ever catching a pass on it all season. In what football fans now refer to as \\"The Ghost to the Post\\", Casper ran a deep post pattern, and Stabler threw a high, arching pass that looked well over thrown and behind Casper. It was Casper's memorable change of direction, chase, and athletic over-the-head catch that became the signature moment for the game. Casper went down at the 14-yard line, setting up an Errol Mann field goal, with 29 seconds left, that tied the game and sent the game to overtime.

National unification came quite late to the Italian peninsula, so its many hundreds of separate cultures remained un-homogenized until quite recently compared to many other European countries. Moreover, Italian folk music reflects Italy's geographic position at the south of Europe and in the center of the Mediterranean Sea: Arabic, African, Celtic, Persian, and Slavic influences are readily apparent in the musical styles of the Italian regions. Italy's rough geography and the historic dominance of small city states has allowed quite diverse musical styles to coexist in close proximity. Today, Italy's folk music is often divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated since. The Celtic and Slavic influences on the group and open-voice choral works of the north contrast with the Arabic, Greek, and African influenced strident monody of the south. In central Italy these influences combine, while indigenous traditions like narrative and ballad singing remain. The music of the island of Sardinia is distinct from that of the rest of Italy, and is best known for the polyphonic chanting of the tenores. Italian folk revival Italian folk musicians performing in Edinburgh The modern understanding of Italian folk music has its roots in the growth of ethnomusicology in the 1940s and 1950s and in the resurgence of regionalism in Italy at the time. The Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare (CNSMP), now part of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, was started in 1948 to study and archive the various musical styles throughout Italy. In the 1950s, a number of important field recordings were conducted by American Alan Lomax and Italians Diego Carpitella, Franco Coggiola, Roberto Leydi among others. Toward the end of the decade, a special effort was made to capture the folk traditions of the Meridione (southern Italy), including an important study by Carpitella and anthropologist Ernesto de Martino of the tarantella. The early 1960s saw the rise of social and political popular music, including a vast number of releases by the I Dischi del Sole label. Several important groups had their birth around the same time, including Cantacronache in 1958 and the Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano (NCI) in 1962. The NCI was an assemblage of musicians and composers including Giovanna Marini that made its first major public appearance at the 1964 Spoleto Festival dei Due Mondi and generated a large number of records and concerts. The Italian folk revival was accelerating by 1966, when the Istituto Ernesto de Martino was founded by Gianni Bosio in Milan to document Italian oral culture and traditional music. With the emergence of the Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare in 1970, the notion of a musical group organized to promote the music of a particular region (in this case, Campania) was clearly gaining momentum. Many of the best known Italian folk revival bands got their start in the following decade, including La Lionetta (1977), Tre Martelli (1977), La Ciapa Rusa (1978), Re Niliu (1979), Calicanto (1981), and Baraban (1983). Northern & central Italy The northern regions of Italy historically exhibited Celtic and Slavic influences in their cultures. Roots revivalists have revived traditional songs, though, from Piedmont (La Ciapa Rusa, Tre Martelli), Lombardy (Barab√†n, Pandemonio) and Veneto (Calicanto). The Genoese docks are the home of trallalero, a polyphonic vocal style with five voices, one of which imitates a guitar. It arose in the 1920s and includes modern groups like La Squadra -- Compagnia del Trallalero and Laura Parodi. The highly urban provinces of northern and central Italy are also known for the medieval sung poetry ottava rima, especially in Tuscany, Lazio and Abruzzo. Ottava rima is performed by the poeti contadini (peasant poets) who use the poems of Homer or Dante, as well as more modern lyrics which address political or social issues. It is often completely improvised, and sometimes competitive in nature. Tuscan folk poetry is closer in form and style to high-culture poetry than is typical elsewhere in Italy. The saltarello dance is also popular throughout the region. Canzoniere del Lazio is one of the biggest names from central Italy during the 1970s roots revival. With socially aware lyrics, this new wave of Italian roots revivalists often played entirely acoustic songs with influences from jazz and others. More modern musicians in the same field include Lucilla Galeazzi, La Piazza and La Macina. Southern Italy Calabrian tarantella at Caulonia (August 2010) Zampogna e ciaramedda A folk dance called the tarantella is still sometimes performed. It was performed to cure the bite of Lycosa tarentula, usually with female victims dancing until exhaustion. Performers used varying rhythms according to the exact kind of spider. Antonio Infantino has explored the percussion-based tarantolati healing rituals since 1975, when he formed the group Tarantolati di Tricarico. Puglia is also home to brass bands like Banda Citt√° Ruvo Di Puglia; this tradition has led to collaborations with jazz musicians like Matteo Salvatore, Battista Lena, Eugenio Colombo, Natale Galletta and Enrico Rava. Another culturally unique musical tradition in Southern Italy is the zampogna, a form of bagpipe originally played by the shepherd class and is still prevalent in the mountainous regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. The Zampogna, in addition to secular use is associated with the annunciation of Christ and it is still not uncommon to see a zampogna player at a nativity scene during the Christmas season. The zampogna is most likely a direct descendant of the Greek aulos and more similar Roman tibia utricularis. =Ethnic Greeks= The ethnic Greeks living in Salento (Puglia) and Calabria have their own distinct dialects (Griko and Grecanico, respectively). They have lived in the area for an undetermined amount of time, possibly as early as Ancient Greece or as late as the Middle Ages. The community has been largely assimilated by the Italian nation, but there remain speakers of the dialects and other aspects of the culture. There was a roots revival in the 1970s in this area, paralleling similar developments across continental Europe, including Brittany and Catalonia. Folk musical traditions in the area include a religious piece, Passiuna tu Christ√π, which recounts the Passion of Christ. The Passion is performed by street accordionists with two singers. An example of a pizzica song from Salento region is Kali Nifta (Good night). The lyrics were written in Griko by Vito Domenico Palumbo (1856‚Äì1918). =Sicily= Sicily is home to a great variety of religious music, including a cappella devotional songs from Montedoro and many brass bands like Banda Ionica, who play songs from a diverse repertoire. Harvest songs and work songs are also indigenous to the agricultural island, known as \\"Italy's granary\\". Franco Battiato, Fratelli Mancuso, Luciano Maio, Taberna Mylaensis and Ciccio Busacca are among the most popular musicians from Sicily. Busacca has worked with Dario Fo, like many Italian musicians, but is perhaps best known for his setting the poems of Ignazio Buttitta, a Sicilian language poet. Fratelli Mancuso (brothers Enzo and Lorenzo Mancuso) have fused traditional Sicilian peasant songs (lamintazioni), monodic chants (a la carrittera) and other indigenous forms to create a uniquely Sicilian modern song style. Sardinia Probably the most culturally distinct of all the regions in Italy, Sardinia is a Mediterranean island known for the cantu a tenore polyphonic chant, sacred songs called gozos, and launeddas, a woodwind instrument similar to the Greek aulos. Launeddas are used to play a complex style of music that has achieved some international attention, especially Dionigi Burranca, Antonio Lara, Luigi Lai and Efisio Melis; Burranca, like many of the most famous launedda musicians, is from Samatzai in Cagliari. An ancient instrument, dating back to at least the 8th century BC, launeddas are still played during religious ceremonies and dances (su ballu). Distinctively, they are played using extensive variations on a few melodic phrases, and a single song can last over an hour. The ottava, or eight-line stanza, is a common lyrical form in Sardinia, one which allows the performer a certain amount of improvisation and is not unlike the stornello of south-central mainland Italy. Rural polyphonic chanting of the tenores is sung with four vocal parts. They are bassu, mesa boghe, contra and boghe (respectively to be properly translated to English from Sardinian as \\"bass\\", \\"middle\\", \\"counter\\" and \\"soloist\\"). The most popular group is Tenores di Bitti. In November 2005, the Cantu a Tenore vocal style of the Sardinian pastoral culture was proclaimed a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Sacred gozos, or sacred songs, can be heard during religious celebrations, sung by choruses like Su Cuncordu 'e su Rosariu. Other influential Sardinian musicians include Totore Chessa (organetto), Maria Carta (singer), Mauro Palmas, Elena Ledda and Suonofficina, Cordas et Cannas, Paolo Fresu (trumpet), Gesuino Deiana (guitar), Tazenda, Marisa Sannia.

The baskets have a distinctive design with a square bottom forming the foundation of the basket. It takes approximately two weeks to complete a basket about 35 cm in diameter. The baskets are made from the ilala palm (mapokwe in Tonga), which, although growing freely, is also planted by Tonga women for the purpose of basket making. This re-planting became standard practice in the late 1980s with the opening of the Tonga Craft Centre in Binga village, Zimbabwe a centre funded by the Danish government, which exports thousands of baskets a year. This craft centre not only keeps the traditional crafts alive (basket-making, drum- making, carving, pottery, and beading), but keeps the women who are involved alive. The Tonga live in an area prone to drought and poverty, and the basket making helps the women feed their families. Traditionally, the baskets were (and still are) used for carrying maize or sorghum from the fields and then winnowing the grain. Traditional designs includes stripes, a spider web type pattern and a lightning pattern.

Both these two definitions are very loose: due to the complex political history of the Italian Peninsula and the different independent political states, cultural and linguistic traditions which sprang within them, it is rather difficult to define what may be considered to be truly Italian. Since before the formation of a unified educational system and the spread of information through the radio and the press during the twenties, all the different cultural and linguistic groups within the country were independent of one another, and a unified Italian Country was still only a political or ideological concept far from the daily life. The Fascist period: Affirmation of a national Italian culture Music and the artistic production of this period reflected the need of the political class to affirm its ideological statement of a united and strong Italian identity on both the political as well as cultural basis. Regional languages and independent cultural inheritances began to be slowly eradicated through the school system and the advent of the mass media which, at the time, were entirely controlled by the Italian government. The slow process of the industrialization which begun during the fascist period had strong effects on the lower classes; it helped in forming the contemporary Italian society, in particular in the economical separation between the north and the south, which is reflected in the different references to the traditional background in the contemporary popular music. Emigration contributed to the exportation of the Italian musical background to other countries such as Argentina, Australia, and the United States. 1948 to the late 1980s: Slow evolution to new forms During the second half of the twentieth century, Italian popular music has seen a strong shift as a result of the influences foreign music had on the Italian musicians brought by the technological advances such as television, tapes vinyl. In particular, the protests of 1968 helped to form a new group of musicians in contrast with the stereotypes of the musica leggera (light music) and opened to new musical forms. * Foundation of musica leggera during the fifties and early sixties, e.g. Domenico Modugno, Adriano Celentano, Mina, Mia Martini, Gino Paoli, Sanremo Festival * Music of the '68 and the Modern Italian troubadours e.g. Fabrizio De Andr√©, Francesco Guccini, Francesco De Gregori, Giorgio Gaber * Opposition with the traditional musica leggera, e.g. Celentano, Mina, Toto Cutugno, Gianni Morandi * New direction of the late 1970s, e.g. progressive rock, Franco Battiato, Le Orme, Lucio Dalla * Rock leggero of the 1980s and 1990s, e.g. Vasco Rossi, Piero Pel√π Contemporary music =Rock and pop= Italian pop and rock has produced many stars including: Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Mango, Max Pezzali, Biagio Antonacci, Antonello Venditti, Lucio Dalla, Lara Fabian, Tiziano Ferro, Anna Tatangelo, partially Salvatore Adamo and Pooh, Adriano Celentano, Mina, Andrea Bocelli and Elisa. Additionally, a popular singer is Viola Valentino. The modern style of pop music tends toward sentimental ballads with a crooning vocal style, though it previously had a blend of Mediterranean folk rhythms fused with pop forms. These folkier pop artists included Lucio Battisti, Vasco Rossi and Pino Daniele. Modern and young emerging artists falling within this genre who have acquired public success for their voices include Alessandra Amoroso, Malika Ayane, Emma, Arisa and Noemi to name a few. During the 1960s and 1970s, Italian popular music changed by incorporating Latin American and Anglo musical traditions, especially Brazilian bossa nova, American and British rock and roll and even jazz. The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecitt√† films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. This film music remained popular in the 1970s, and then underwent a revival in the 1990s. Italy was one of the leading nations of the progressive rock movement of the 1970s (the others being Germany and the United Kingdom), and its progressive scene was big, united and lively. The main Italian style of progressive rock was symphonic rock mixed with Italian folk music influences, e.g. Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Premiata Forneria Marconi, Pooh, Il Balletto di Bronzo. There were also some experimental rock bands around, such as Area. Progressive rock concerts were usually political events with an energetic atmosphere: Area's songs had mainly left-wing political lyrics. Beginning in the 1980s, pop grew more heterogeneous and more in line with international sounds. Italian house music spawned Black Box, whose first single \\"Ride on Time\\" was an international hit, making the Top 10 in many countries and no 1 in the UK, becoming the UK's best-selling single of 1989. Zucchero is a leading Italian rock musician along with Luciano Ligabue and Vasco Rossi, whilst Jovanotti is a widely popular singer mixing elements of dance music with Italian popular music and rap. Other prominent rock bands include Litfiba. In the 2000s, dance music group DB Boulevard with vocalist Moony, charted at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart in 2001, with their song \\"Point of View\\". The video accompanying the song featured a computer-animated cardboard woman driving a cardboard car through a cardboard city. The song earned DB Boulevard the distinction of being the first Italian music group to be nominated at the MTV Europe Music Awards. =Electronic and dance music= Techno, trance, and electronica are all popular forms of electronic dance music in Italy. The country is home to genres such as Italodance, Italo house and Italo disco, and the Swiss-born but Italy-raised Robert Miles was one of the seminal artists of the dream trance genre. * Barrio Jazz Gang * Benny Benassi * Eiffel 65 * Gabry Ponte * Gigi D'Agostino * Montefiori Cocktail * Nicola Conte =Hip hop= The Italian hip hop scene began in the early 1990s with Articolo 31 from Milan. Their style was mainly influenced by the East Coast rap. Other early rap groups are typically politically oriented acts like 99 Posse (who later became influenced by British trip hop). More recent artists of the genre include Fabri Fibra and Club Dogo. Return to tradition: Patchanka Following De Andr√©, many artists are rediscovering the forms of traditional music abandoned since the fascist period as a sort of traditional revival, including Tazenda and Teresa De Sio. There are bands in Italy that play patchanka music, characterized by a mixture of traditional music, punk, reggae, rock, and political lyrics. Modena City Ramblers are one of the more popular bands; they mix Irish, Italian, punk, reggae and many other forms of music. Other bands include Casa del Vento, Mau Mau, Banda Bassotti and Talco. Jazz The most important jazz scenes are in Rome and Milan, however many Italian jazz musicians are resident in Paris. Italian instrumentalists include: saxophonists Stefano di Battista and Francesco Cafiso, pianists Danilo Rea and Stefano Bollani, trumpet players Paolo Fresu and Enrico Rava. Palermo also has a lively jazz scene, including Enzo Rao, who have added native Sicilian influences to American jazz.

The word was inherited by Classical Greek from Mycenean Greek with the same meaning and it was applied to several goddesses. A similar word is the title Despoina, \\"the mistress\\", which was given to the nameless chthonic goddess of the mysteries of Arcadian cult.

On a number of tablets from Pylos, we find po-ti-ni-ja (potnia) without any accompanying word. Chadwick suggests that she was the mother-goddess of the Mycenaeans. It seems that she had an important shrine at the site Pakijanes near Pylos.G. Mylonas (1965) Mycenae and the Mycenaean age, Princeton University Press, p.159 Wanax (wa-na-ka) was her male companion in the Mycenean cult, and this title was usually applied to the god Poseidon (po-se-da-o) as king of the underworld.

A famous Minoan seal impression found by Arthur Evans shows a nameless goddess brandishing a spear and standing upon the representation of a mountain flanked by rampant lions, and the representation seems similar to the Homeric potnia theron (the mistress of the animals).

Potnia is almost always accompanied by an epithet characterizing a particular place or function of the mistress : po-ti-ni-ja,a-si-wi-ja (a-si-wi-ja = ethnic adjective, possibly \\"Asian (Lydian) woman\\"), si-to-po-ti-ni-ja (sitos = \\"grain\\", of wheat or barley; probably referring to Demeter or her predecessor), po-ti-ni-ja,i-qe-ja (Potnia Hippeia, \\"Horse Goddess\\").

The explosion, which killed 439 miners and a rescuer, is the worst mining accident in the United Kingdom. Universal Colliery, on the South Wales Coalfield, extracted steam coal, which was much in demand. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen. In an earlier disaster in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest established that the colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in the east side of the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp‚Äîa poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion. Fires in the workings hampered rescue efforts, and it took several days before they were under control. It took several weeks for most of the bodies to be recovered. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined ¬£24 while the company was fined ¬£10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 1 shilling d (about ¬£ in ). In 1981 a memorial to the men who died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion. Background Caerphilly borough =Welsh coal industry= The Welsh coal industry employed 1,500 workers in 1800; as the industry expanded, the workforce rose to 30,000 by 1864, and to 250,000 by 1913. As employment became available, many people moved to the area of the South Wales Coalfield; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8 million long tons of coal (63.6 million short tons) a year, up from 8.5 million long tons (9.5 million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined a fifth of all coal produced in the UK, and employed a fifth of its miners in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1913 Britain was responsible for 25 per cent of world coal production and 55 per cent of all world coal exports. The South Wales Coalfield produced the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals‚Äîthe latter a grade between the two comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp‚Äîa mixture of methane and hydrogen‚Äîand were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. The carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to form carboxyhemoglobin, which prevents the blood cells carrying oxygen, and can therefore result in suffocation by lack of oxygen known as anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face the possibility of being killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp in South Wales's collieries contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18 per cent of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time. =Senghenydd and the Universal Colliery= Senghenydd‚Äî in Welsh‚Äîis situated at the northern end of the Aber Valley, approximately north-west of Caerphilly and north-west of Cardiff. When geological surveys for coal began in 1890 it was a farming hamlet of around 100 people. Coal was found, and sinking of the first mineshaft for Universal Colliery‚Äîwhich was owned and developed by William Lewis‚Äîbegan in 1891; the first coal was extracted in 1896. The colliery's two shafts were both deep, the downcast Lancaster and the upcast York. Development of the pit coincided with the Boer War, and sectors of the underground workings were named after key places in the war, such as Pretoria, or the lifting of the sieges at Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. Sir William Lewis in 1891 South Wales miners, including those at Universal, were paid on a rate determined by the Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike that the men at Universal joined at the end of April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400 short tons) of coal a week. The industrial historians Helen and Baron Duckham consider Universal Colliery to have been \\"an unlucky mine\\". At approximately 5:00 am on 24 May 1901 three underground explosions occurred as the night shift was exiting the pit. Because the explosion damaged the pit winding gear, it took time to clear the debris from the pithead to allow rescuers to begin work. They descended at 11:00 am and rescued one man, an ostler, found alongside the corpse of the horse he was tending. There were no other survivors and 81 men died. The funerals for the victims started four days later, and the rescue and recovery operations lasted for six weeks. The Mines Inspectorate began an enquiry, chaired by the mining engineer William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It stated that the mine was hot with high levels of coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated. Le Petit Journal illustration of the Courri√®res mine disaster. In 1906 a major explosion at a colliery in Courri√®res, northern France, caused the deaths of more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force in December that year. Among other changes to the health and safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913. In 1913 the colliery was producing 1,800 long tons (2,000 short tons) of coal a day, and Senghenydd's population had grown to just under 6,000. No work was undertaken at Senghenydd to implement the requirement, and the Mines Inspectorate gave the management an extended deadline of September 1913 to complete the work, but this, too, was missed. 14 October 1913 The layout of the Senghenydd mines, showing the location of the victims, and how they had died At 3:00 am on 14 October 1913, the day firemen descended the pit to conduct the daily checks for gas; they had three hours to complete their investigations. The firemen for the Mafeking return had to travel more than two miles from the shaft bottom to the workface. It left insufficient time in which to make a thorough check of the workings‚Äîwhich involved placing a naked flame into cavities to see if the flame lengthened‚Äîthe historian Michael Lieven states that \\"the company considered any other form of inspection to be too time-consuming\\". Between 5:10 and 6:00 am 950 men descended the shaft for a shift that was due to last until 2:00 pm. Just after 8:00 am an explosion occurred in the west side of the underground workings. It is possible there were two explosions as survivors stated a smaller explosion preceded the main one; the official report referred only to one. The cause was probably a build- up of firedamp that was ignited by an electric spark from equipment such as electric bell signalling gear. The initial explosion ignited airborne coal dust, and a shock wave ahead of the explosion raised yet more coal dust, which also combusted. Many victims who were not killed immediately by the explosion and fire died from the effects of afterdamp. The explosive wave travelled up the Lancaster shaft to the surface, destroying the headframe; it killed the winder‚Äîthe man in charge‚Äîand badly injured his deputy. A rescue team leaving the pit Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, was on the surface and the remaining shift foremen were still underground and unable to give assistance. He took charge and descended the York shaft, accompanied by overman D R Thomas. The descent was slow, and they had to clear several girders and obstructions before they reached the bottom. They found that the men from the east side of the workings (approximately 450 workers) were unharmed, and their evacuation was ordered. Shaw and Thomas moved to the western side, where they found other men, alive but injured, and arranged for them to travel to the surface. Thomas later reported that the view into the western workings \\"was exactly like looking into a furnace\\". Shaw explored what he could of the western workings, before he and some of the survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30 am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00 am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning. A thirteen-year-old girl awaits news with her baby sister. Lieven recounts how the rescue parties \\"in their desperation, ... were reckless with their lives\\" in their attempts to find survivors; many were injured in small roof collapses, or suffered the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their endeavours saved lives throughout the remainder of the day and into the night, including a group of 18 men found at around 1:00 am. They were the last survivors found. A total of 432 miners had died that day‚Äîsome bodies were not found until later‚Äîand 7 others died later in hospital or at home. A journalist from The Times wrote: \\"The numbers are truly awful. We talk in awed terms of the decimation of a regiment in a bloody battle, but here a great community engaged in the pursuit of a peaceful vocation is threatened with the loss of at least a quarter of its able bodied manhood\\". On the surface the townsfolk waited for news; a reporter for The Dundee Courier thought: \\"the scene at Senghenydd last night was depressing in the extreme. The streets were full of silent throngs of people who moved aimlessly about or stood stolidly at the street corners.\\" Rescue, fire- fighting and recovery: 15 October to 30 November Work continued throughout the night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During the course of the day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft. Bringing the bodies out Reginald McKenna, the Home Secretary, visited the colliery on 15 October representing King George V, who was attending the marriage of Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife. The king sent a ¬£500 donation to a disaster relief fund; the royal couple displayed their wedding presents at St James's Palace and charged a shilling for entrance, raising ¬£1,200 for the fund. The fund was started by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff; another collection, the Mansion House Fund set up by the Lord Mayor of London, raised more than ¬£3,000 on its first day. William Brace, the local MP speaking on behalf of the South Wales Miners' Federation, announced on 16 October that the priority would be given to putting out the fire and that no more search parties would be looking for survivors. Brace observed that the fire was blocking the western workings and consuming the oxygen in the air, making it unlikely that anyone was left alive. Progress in tackling the fire over the previous days had been slow, and it had only been extinguished in the first 30 yards of the roadway‚Äîstill from the coal face. Two coroner's inquests were opened: one in Senghenydd for the men who died in the colliery, and one in Cardiff for those who had died in hospital; both were adjourned the same day. The first funerals took place the following day, Friday 17 October. An estimated 150,000 mourners gathered for the 11 men buried on the Saturday and 8 on the Sunday. The funeral of one of the miners, E Gilbert, a colour sergeant in The Salvation Army The firefighters built bashings, walls of sandbags, turf and sand, approximately 18 feet (5.5 metres) deep and 17 feet (5.2 metres) up to the tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling the rest of the workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. The fire was contained, but miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris; another fall was more than 300 feet (91.5 metres) long and 30 to 40 feet (10‚Äì12 metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. The explosion, fire and subsequent decomposition made it difficult to identify many victims; some had to be identified by their personal effects, and some bodies remained unidentified. By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts had been fully explored, with more than 200 bodies raised to the surface in the preceding two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still unaccounted for. Toward the end of the month, the men voted to return to work, even though the western workings were still out of action and 11 bodies were still missing. A photographer, W Benton, took a series of photographs as the disaster unfolded, and later published them as a set of postcards. Their publication is described by the National Library of Wales as \\"an excellent example of early photo-journalism\\". The photographs came with a caption, shown below: File:Senghenydd pit disaster 10.jpgalt=Two miners pose for the camera.

The deaths of 440 men from a small community had a devastating effect; 60 victims were younger than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost their fathers and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while the death of one father and son left an 18-year-old daughter to raise her 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger. The inquiry into the disaster opened on 2 January 1914 with Richard Redmayne, the Chief Inspector of Mines, as the commissioner; he was assisted by two assessors, Evan Williams, the chairman of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coal Owners Association, and Robert Smillie, the president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. The inquiry ran for three days before being adjourned to allow for the coroner's inquest to run at Senghenydd. It reopened on 27 January and ran until 21 February. Over the 13 days it heard evidence, 21,837 questions were put to 50 witnesses. The coroner's inquest chaired by David Rees lasted for 5 days from 5 January 1914. A total of 9,000 questions were put to 50 witnesses, and the jury returned verdicts of accidental death. The inquiry report failed to identify a definite cause, but it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of many aspects of the management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft; Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion. Further criticism was directed toward the emergency procedures. The lack of respirators at the mine was deemed to have cost lives. The lack of an adequate water supply for fire fighting was criticised, and Redmayne wrote: \\"I should have thought, in view of the fact that the colliery was such a gassy one, and it had already been devastated by an explosion, that the management would have made arrangements for a supply of water adequate to meet an emergency of the kind that actually occurred.\\" Shaw's actions were described by Lieven as those that \\"gained him a degree of respect from the local mining community which remained over the years; they probably also cost the lives of scores of miners.\\" The Duckhams describe Shaw's inaction in fixing the ventilation fan before the explosion, as well as his delay in sending for assistance from rescue teams until he exited the mine an hour and a half after the explosion. The official report considered there had been a \\"disquieting laxity in the management of the mine\\", although Shaw was described by the Duckhams as \\"undoubtedly a highly capable manager\\". The report led to Shaw being charged with 17 breaches of the Mines Act 1911, and four charges were made against the company. Shaw was found guilty of failing to keep adequate environmental records and failing to replace a broken lamp locker; he was fined ¬£24. The company was convicted of failing to provide a ventilation system that could reverse the airflow and was fined ¬£10 with ¬£5 5 shillings costs. One newspaper, the Merthyr Pioneer, calculated \\"Miners' Lives at 1/ each\\" (1 shilling d or ¬£ in ). After it reopened the colliery never reached the same levels of employment as before the explosion. William Lewis died in August 1914; Shaw continued as manager of the mine until November 1928, when it closed. A stage play based on the disaster, by the journalist and broadcaster Margaret Coles, was first performed at the Sherman Cymru, Cardiff in 1991. The disaster at Senghenydd has provided the backdrop to two printed works of historical fiction: Alexander Cordell's This Sweet and Bitter Earth (1977) and Cwmwl dros y Cwm (2013) by Gareth F. Williams. In 1981 a memorial to those lost in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board. Based outside Nant-y-parc Primary School, which is built on the site of the former colliery, the monument is a high replica of the colliery's winding gear. A second monument was unveiled in 2006 to the dead from both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. On 14 October 2013, the centenary of the disaster, a Welsh national memorial to all mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead. Funded by the Aber Valley Heritage Group and their patron Roy Noble, with matched funding from the Welsh Government, a bronze statue by Les Johnson depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion, was unveiled by Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales. Jones said: \\"Mining is central to the story of Wales. It has shaped our history and communities and its social and physical legacy is still with us to this day. ... It is only right that we have a permanent memorial.\\" See also * Glossary of coal mining terminology * History of coal mining * List of disasters in Great Britain and Ireland by death toll Notes and references =Notes= =References= =Sources=      * External links * Aber Valley Heritage Group * BBC Radio 4, Making History, 7 October 2003: The Senghenydd Colliery Disaster, 1913 (audio file) * 1962 interview with William Vizard, ex-miner who survived the disaster Category:1910s in Glamorgan Category:1913 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:1913 in Wales Category:1913 mining disasters Category:Coal mining disasters in Wales Category:Deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning Category:October 1913 events ","title":"Senghenydd colliery disaster"},{"id":"3911651","text":"Rothrock State Forest is a Pennsylvania state forest in Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry District #5. The main offices are located in Huntingdon in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Rothrock State Forest is located in Centre, Huntingdon, and Mifflin Counties. State College, home of Penn State University is only a few miles from many of the entrances of Rothrock, leading to high utilization of the forest by students and staff of the university. Rothrock shares a common border on its eastern portion with Bald Eagle State Forest and is just north of areas of Tuscarora State Forest. History Rothrock State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock, for whom the forest is named, became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since they had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Two of Dr. Rothrock's major accomplishments as commissioner were his land acquisition program and the creation of a forest academy to train foresters for state service. He led the effort in central Pennsylvania to acquire land that had once belonged to the Greenwood Iron Works. The iron company had left behind approximately of land that had been stripped of its old growth forest to provide fuel in the form of charcoal for the iron furnaces in northern Huntingdon County. Additional land was purchased soon after until nearly all of the Seven Mountain area had become state property. The lands acquired in the early 20th century were divided into three separate state forest reserves. Logan State Forest comprised the land in northern Huntingdon County and Ferguson and Harris Townships in Centre County. Penn State Forest was located in Potter Township, Centre County and Armagh Township and Brown Township Townships in Mifflin County. Rothrock State Forest was near Mount Union and Entriken, in Huntingdon County. The three forests were merged in 1953 with parts of Penn and Logan being added to Bald Eagle State Forest and the rest combined to make what is now Rothrock State Forest. Some of the first firetowers built in Pennsylvania were constructed in Rothrock State Forest in the 1920s. Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot, former chief of the U.S. Forest Service upgraded the Pennsylvania Forestry Division to full department status and gave the new Department of Forest and Waters the funds needed to build steel observation towers in the state forests. The construction of the observation towers combined with changes in forest management lead to a dramatic decrease in the number and size of forest fires throughout the state forests of Pennsylvania. Much of the land that is now Rothrock State Forest was cleared of dried underbrush during the Great Depression by the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In addition to clearing the forests and streams of brush the CCC also built roads and trails in the state forests and parks and many of the recreational facilities still in use at the state parks in the Rothrock State Forest area. By the 1950s the second growth forests of oak and hickory had grown to a size that the wood was ready to be harvested for lumber. A scientific forestry management plan was put into place in 1955. The timber management plan was expanded to a natural resource management plan in 1985. The new management plan covers the management of water, wildlife, timber, fire protection and recreation. Recreational use of the Rothrock State Forest has grown in the last several decades. All visitors are asked to learn and comply with all state forest regulations while using and respecting the forest and its facilities.

Other attractions =Mountain Biking=  Opportunities  Numerous mountain biking trails can be found throughout Rothrock State Forest. It is one of the premier mountain bike destinations in the state, as evidenced by the world class race events held here annually. Shingletown Gap and Coopers Gap are two areas that have a high concentration of popular mountain bike trails. Rothrock has two IMBA Epic rides; each uses trails in these two separate Gaps.  Navigation  Many cyclists and hikers use a Rothrock Purple Lizard Map to navigate of the forest. Additional print maps and resources can be found on the Keystone Trails Association website and IMBA‚Äôs website. Free print maps are available from the DCNR Rothrock State Forest webpage or Nittany Mountain Bike Association‚Äôs site. Many trails have been mapped on OpenStreetMap, as well. =Hiking= The Rothrock State Forest contains nearly 300 miles of hiking trails. The Pennsylvania Mid State Trail (MST), a 326-mile cross-country trail running from the Green Ridge State Forest in Maryland to a spur of the Finger Lakes trail in New York, crosses the Rothrock State Forest for about 42 miles.

A scream is a loud vocalization in which air is passed through the vocal folds with greater force than is used in regular or close- distance vocalisation. This can be performed by any creature possessing lungs, including humans. A scream is often an instinctive or reflex action, with a strong emotional aspect, like fear, pain, annoyance, surprise, joy, excitement, anger, etc. Troponyms A large number of words exist to describe the act of making loud vocalizations, whether intentionally or in response to stimuli, and with specific nuances. For example, an early twentieth century synonym guide places variations under the heading of \\"call\\", and includes as synonyms, bawl, bellow, clamor, cry (out), ejaculate, exclaim, roar, scream, shout, shriek, vociferate, and yell, each with its own implications.James Champlin Fernald, \\"Call\\", English Synonyms and Antonyms: With Notes on the Correct Use of Prepositions\\" (1914), p. 136-37. This source states: Another source proposes different implications for some of these terms, stating that \\"the call is normally addressed to a specific person... and the shout projected to a distant but identifiable target, the holler is emitted to whomever may be within earshot\\".John Shepherd, \\"Holler/Hollering\\", Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production (2003), p. 137. Whooping is another name given to the same kind of noise making as hollering. This source separately notes that a shout \\"may be angry or joyous; it may be directed to one person or many; and, sometimes, its purpose may be merely for the satisfaction of release or of hearing an echo\\".John Shepherd, \\"Shout/Shouter\\", Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production (2003), p. 106.  As a phenomenon  = In psychology = In psychology, the scream is an important theme in the theories of Arthur Janov. In his book The Primal Scream, Janov claims that the cure for neurosis is to confront the patient with his suppressed pain resulting from an experienced trauma. This confrontation gives birth to a scream. Janov believes that it is not necessary that it heals the patient from his trauma. The scream is only a form of expression of primal pain, which comes from one's childhood, and the reliving of this pain and its expression. This finally appears through the scream and can cure the patient from his neurosis. Janov describes the primal scream as very distinctive and unmistakable. It is a ‚Äústrangely low, rattling and involuntary sound. [‚Ä¶] Some people are moaning, groaning and are coiling themselves up. [‚Ä¶] One screams as result of all the other times when it had to stay still, was making fun of, was humiliated or was beaten up‚Äù. Janov also says that the primal scream has series of reactions; ‚Äúthe patients that could not even say ‚Äúpiep‚Äù at home, suddenly feels powerful. The scream seems to be a liberating experience‚Äù. Janov noticed this with all his patients. Women who seem to have baby-voices during the therapy are developing with their primal scream a very low voice. = As focus of power = Gregory Whitehead, founder of the Institute for Screamscape Studies, believes that the voice is used to focus the power: ‚Äúscream used to be a psychological weapon both for you and against your opponent, it raises confidence to the person using it. Creating power with yell is having to affect someone without touching them‚Äù.Gregory Whitehead quote from the Radio Play \\"Pressures of the unspeakable\\" Sydney, 1992 In this case screaming is a protective weapon, as also often used by animals, who scream as an expression of power or during fights with another animals. = Pleasure = Screaming and yelling are also a means of expressing pleasure. Studies on monkeys have shown that when female monkeys scream during sex, it helps the male ejaculate. An approximation of 86 percent of the times where female monkeys screamed during sexual encounter, brought a 59 percent of success rate, in comparison to the 2 percent, without the female-scream. Gayle Brewer of the University of Central Lancashire and Colin Hendrie of the University of Leeds made a similar research with women, that shows that women also do scream often during intercourse as an encouragement for their partner to do \\"a better job\\". = First = Janov believes that for babies, screaming is the only form of communication he or she can have; it is the only way a baby can express his necessities, that he needs food, he is in pain or he simply needs some love. Janov writes, ‚Äúscreaming is a language ‚Äì a primitive one, but a human language‚Äù. = Communication and language = Diana K√∂nig, journalist and broadcasting author, writes: ‚ÄúIf the scream of babies is their first communication method, then the scream of adults is a recession from communication. By screaming, in the opposite of calling, the voice becomes overloaded and over-amplified, and it loses its control, its fundamental sound‚Äù. The scream is there before language and it appears where the language reaches its limits. Elaine Scarry, writer and literature professor, talks about language in connection to pain and she thinks that pain almost destroys the language because it brings people back into a state where sounds and screams are dominating as they were their means of communication before they learned how to speak. Pain cannot actually be communicated, as it is a personal experience and can only be experienced individually. Pain, as any other concept, is actually an individual experience that can only be communicated as an idea and it also is to be interpreted as. Hegel writes: ‚ÄúThe biggest relief when having pain is to be able to scream it out [‚Ä¶] through this expression, the pain becomes objective and this makes the connection between the subject, who is alone in pain, and the object, that is not in pain.‚Äù Arnal and colleague demonstrated that human screams exploit a unique acoustic property, roughness, that selectively activates the auditory brain as well as the amygdala, a deep brain structure involved in danger processing.  Art  = Painting = The Scream, Edvard Munch The Scream () is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition, created as both paintings and pastels, by the Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910. Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature) is the title Munch gave to these works, all of which show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as \\"an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.\\"Arthur Lubow, \\"Edvard Munch: Beyond The Scream\\", Smithsonian Magazine, March 2006, (retrieved 29 March 2013) = Music = In music there are long traditions of scream in rock, punk rock, heavy metal, rock and roll and emo music. Vocalists are developing various techniques of screaming that results in different ways of screaming. In rock and metal music singers are developing very demanding guttural and growled sounds. Scream is also used predominant as an esthetic element in ‚Äúcante jondo‚Äù, a vocal style in flamenco. The name of this style is translated as ‚Äúdeep sing‚Äù. The origins of flamenco and also of its name are still not clear. Flamenco is related to the gypsies‚Äô music and it is said to have appeared in Andalusia in Spain. In cante jondo, that is a subdivision of flamenco, which is considered to be more serious and deep, the singer is reduced to the most rudimentary method of expression, which is the cry and the scream. Ricardo Molima, a Spanish poet, wrote \\"flamenco is the primal scream in its primitive form, from a people sunk in poverty and ignorance. Thus, the original flamenco song could be described as a type of self-therapy.‚Äù David N. Green, musician, writer and composer, wrote in 1987 an essay about musicians using screams as a singing technique in music. He makes the distinction between harmonic scream that relates to the harmony of the music and has components of tonality, the true scream that is atonal, the lyrical scream that is related with the song's lyrics and the pure scream that is not. The harmonic scream is the scream that is still very clear and has a defined pitch and that, according to Green, can actually be related to a fake scream; as it has no great disturbance, the lyrical scream that is related to words, most of the time swearing and the pure scream or the true scream, that in this case can also be called as the real scream or the primal scream. Scream in music can also be seen in other ways than just a vocal action. Many musicians use scream as an inspirational source for their playing with instruments. This is usually represented in a loud hit on the instrument's chords, in the case of the instruments that have chords, or a loud striking note, on the blowing instruments. = Sound art = Pressure of the unspeakable is a radio feature work by Gregory Whitehead. Initiated in 1991 the project started with the founding of the Institute of the Screamscape studies where people were asked through radio and television to call on a hot line and scream. Whitehead notes: ‚ÄúIn addition to framing the nervous system, the telephone-microphone-tape-recorder-radio circuitry also provided the key for the acoustic demarcation of pressure in the system: distortion, the disruption of digital codes, pure unmanageable noise. The scream as an eruption in excess of prescribed circuitries, as capable of ‚Äú blowing‚Äù communications technologies not designed for such extreme and unspeakable meanings‚Äù. Whitehead gathered slowly an archive of screams that was edited and resulted in a theoretical narrative radio feature. Allen S. Weiss notes about his work that ‚Äúthe screamscape lies beyond any possible determination of authenticity‚Äù. The people's vociferations are just manifestations that through their anonymity create a sense of togetherness. = Theater = Actors are taught from the beginning of their careers how to scream correctly. They learn how to awaken that uncomfortable feeling in the listener without necessarily having to have any psychological attachment. = Antonin Artaud = Antonin Artaud's' last written work To have done with the judgment of god was recorded by him for the French radio in 1947. One day before it was scheduled, the director of the radio prohibited it for strong anti-religious and anti- American reasons. The piece consists of intensive texts with interludes of instrumental and vocal improvised sounds and screams. Allen S. Weiss writes about Antonin Artaud‚Äôs scream: ‚Äúthe scream is the expulsion of an unbearable, impossible internal polarization between life‚Äôs forces and death‚Äôs negation, simultaneously signifying and simulation creation and destruction [‚Ä¶] scream, as a nonmaterial double of excrement, may be both expression and expulsion, a sign of birth creation and frustration [‚Ä¶] the scream is the desublimation of speech into the body, in opposition to the sublimation of body into meaningful speech‚Äù. The extreme character of the scream has a life danger element that stands for denying of death. In Artaud's case, a person that was always very close to death and has been calling himself so ever since having strong shock therapies, the scream represents exactly this border between life and death, creation and destruction, of art work and of oneself. Artaud's screams are mostly related to words. The small interludes that are in between the texts parts sometimes contain screams. = Performance art = Screaming for good Marina Abramovic used scream as an element in different performances: together with Ulay in AAA AAA, the two are facing each other and are gradually screaming louder and louder while getting closer and closer to each other's face, until they both lose their voice; Freeing the voice, where Abramovic is staying with her head upside down and screaming till she is left with no voice anymore.  Other aspects  = Dialogue = A verbal altercation between two people during a protest in New York City. Some people, when arguing begin to raise their voices to the point that they are screaming at each other in anger while continuing their debate exchange. Terminology includes \\"shouting match\\". = Military = U.S. Marine Corps recruit sounds off in response to a drill instructor. Drill instructors frequently shout orders at trainees to train recruits into the military culture whilst fostering obedience and expedience. = Audio level = The volume levels of outcries may be very high, and this has become an issue in the sport of tennis, particularly with regards to Maria Sharapova's loud tennis grunts which have been measured as high as 101.2 decibels.Tennis grunters told to stop the racket, Linda Pearce, Theage.com, retrieved December 19, 2007 The loudest verified scream emitted by a human measured 129 dBA, a record set by teaching assistant Jill Drake in 2000.

Background  Gao Conghui was born in 891, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. At that time, or shortly after his birth, he might have been known by the surname of Zhu ‚Äî because his father Gao Jichang had become an adoptive son of Zhu Yourang (), who in turn was an adoptive son of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). (It was not until later in Gao Jichang's career that his name was changed back to Gao ‚Äî sometime after 903.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 133.See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263 [Gao Jichang's advice to Zhu Quanzhong in the 903 campaign ‚Äî described in his biography as before the name change back to Gao]. Gao Conghui's mother was a Lady Zhang; it was not clearly stated in the historical accounts whether she was Gao Jichang's wife or concubine, although it was said that Gao Jichang favored her.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 102. He was Gao Jichang's oldest son. Apparently sometime after Gao Jichang was made the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and sometime after Zhu Quanzhong had seized the Tang throne and established his own Later Liang as its emperor, Gao Jichang sent Gao Conghui to then-capital Luoyang to serve as an imperial attendant, and he later became the supervisor for cavalry supplies. On a later occasion, when he was given a vacation back to his father's post at Jingnan, Gao Jichang kept him at Jingnan and made him a commander of the Jingnan army.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 69. At some point, either during his service at the Later Liang capital or after his return to Jingnan, Gao Conghui successively carried the title of prefect of Hao Prefecture (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui ‚Äî then under control of Wu) and prefect of Gui Prefecture (Ê≠∏Â∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei, one of the Jingnan prefectures). In 925 ‚Äî by which time Later Liang had been conquered by Later Tang, which Gao Jichang then was a vassal of (and had, therefore, changed his name to Gao Jixing, to observe naming taboo for the Later Tang emperor Li Cunxu's grandfather Li Guochang (and Gao Jixing was carrying the Later Tang-created title of Prince of Nanping)) ‚Äî Li Cunxu launched a major attack to destroy Later Tang's southwestern neighbor Former Shu. As part of the attack, he assigned Gao the task of capturing three of Former Shu's eastern prefectures on the border with Jingnan Circuit, Kui (), Zhong (), and Wan () (all in modern Chongqing). Gao left Gao Conghui in charge of the Jingnan headquarters and attacked west, but was defeated by the Former Shu general Zhang Wu () and forced to return to Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality. (Zhang later surrendered his territory to the overall Later Tang commander Li Jiji, not to Gao Jixing.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. In 926 ‚Äî by which time Former Shu had fallen to Later Tang, but Later Tang itself was then overrun with mutinies ‚Äî Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang, and his adoptive brother Li Siyuan succeeded him as emperor. Gao Jixing requested that Kui, Zhong, and Wan become part of his territory, and Li Siyuan initially agreed. However, when the imperial government would not agree to Gao's demand that he himself be allowed to commission those prefects without imperial agreement, Gao seized Kui by force ‚Äî effectively rebelling against the Later Tang imperial government.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Gao Conghui was said to have repeatedly urged Gao Jixing against rebelling against Later Tang, but Gao Jixing did not listen. Subsequently, during his (successful) resistance campaign against the Later Tang army sent against him, Gao instead submitted to Wu as a vassal ‚Äî an overture that Wu initially rejected but later accepted. Apparently as part of Gao's submission to Wu, Gao Conghui was given the title by Wu's emperor Yang Pu of military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei, then under Later Tang control); Yang also gave him the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().  Reign  = During Later Tang = Around the new year 929, Gao Jixing fell ill, and put Gao Conghui in charge of Jingnan's headquarters. Gao Jixing died shortly after. Yang Pu thereafter gave him the title of military governor of Jingnan, and bestowed on him the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Upon his assumption of Jingnan's governance, however, Gao Conghui believed that it was inadvisable to continue to be inimical to Later Tang and be a vassal to Wu, pointing out that Wu's main territory was much farther away than Later Tang. He therefore, through his southern neighbor Ma Yin the King of Chu, offered apologies to Li Siyuan, and later also made the same request by writing Later Tang's military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, i.e., the same circuit as Zhongyi), An Yuanxin (). When An relayed his request to Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan agreed to his request to resubmit. He then submitted a petition, referring to himself to only to his former Later Tang-approved titles of commander of the Jingnan army and prefect of Gui Prefecture (i.e., not with the ones that Wu had conferred). Li Siyuan accepted his submission, gave him the titles of military governor of Jingnan and Shizhong, and formally terminated the campaign against Jingnan. (Later Tang had not pursued the campaign actively for several years, but had never formally terminated the campaign.) Gao also submitted a petition to Yang, apologizing for resubmitting to Later Tang, but asking that his decision be excused because he had been concerned that the tombs of the Gao ancestors, located within Later Tang territory, would be destroyed. Wu sent an army to attack Jingnan, but could not capture it.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. In 931, Li Siyuan gave Gao the honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (). In 932, he created Gao the Prince of Bohai. In 934, he created Gao the Prince of NanpingZizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. ‚Äî the same title that Gao Jixing had held previously. It was said that Gao was intelligent, understanding, humble, and willing to listen to others. He particularly trusted Gao Jixing's chief strategist Liang Zhen, treating Liang as an older brother. There was an occasion when people relaying the news to him about the court of Ma Yin's son and successor Ma Xifan, who then carried the title of Prince of Chu, talking of the grandeurs of Ma Xifan's lifestyle. Initially, Gao, impressed, stated, \\"Prince Ma is truly a man.\\" His staffer Sun Guangxian responded:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Gao initially did not realize the wisdom of Sun's words, but after some time, he did. He stated to Liang, \\"After I thought about my daily living, I believe that I am already excessive.\\" He thus ended using luxurious items, and spent his time enjoying reading classical literature. He also was merciful in punishments and did not impose great tax burdens, so his people were comforted. Liang, believing that the state was in good hands, sought to retire, and after Gao could not dissuade him from the idea, allowed him to, but built a grand mansion for him on an island and would occasionally visited him to give him many gifts. Liang, in retirement, also still occasionally visited him and gave him advice. After Liang's retirement, he entrusted the affairs of the state to Sun. In 936, believing that Wu's regent Xu Zhigao was interested in seizing the Wu throne, Gao wrote him to encourage him to do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Xu eventually did so, in 937, ending Wu and establishing Southern Tang, and thereafter changing his name to Li Bian, as Li was his original family name.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Subsequently, Gao requested to establish a liaison office at Southern Tang's capital Jinling, and Li Bian agreed. = During Later Jin = In 941 ‚Äî by which time Later Tang had fallen, and its former territory was ruled by Shi Jingtang (Li Siyuan's son-in-law) as the emperor of the succeeding Later Jin ‚Äî Later Jin's military governor of Shannan East, An Congjin, was plotting to rebel against Later Jin, and he sent emissaries to ask for aid from both Gao Conghui and Later Shu's emperor Meng Chang. Meng declined the overture, and Gao wrote An, urging him not to rebel. An, in anger, instead reported to Shi that Gao was planning to rebel against Later Jin. At the urging of his commander of the army, Wang Baoyi (), Gao submitted An's letters to Shi, and offered to aid the Later Jin imperial government in coming operations against An. Subsequently, when An did in fact rebel, both Gao and Ma Xifan sent fleets and food supplies to aid the Later Jin commander of the operations against An, Gao Xingzhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Gao Xingzhou was subsequently able to defeat An, and An committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. After An's defeat, Gao requested Shi's nephew and successor Shi Chonggui that Later Jin gave him Ying Prefecture (ÈÉ¢Â∑û, in modern Jingmen, Hubei); Shi Chonggui declined. = During Liao and Later Han = In a campaign in 946-947, Emperor Taizong of the Khitan Liao Dynasty successfully captured Kaifeng and forced Shi Chonggui to surrender, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Emperor Taizong claimed to also be the emperor of China, and, initially, the Later Jin regional governors submitted to him. Gao Conghui also did so, and offered tributes to him. At the same time, though, Gao also sent emissaries to one of the holdouts, Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), urging Liu to claim imperial title. He promised to support Liu if Liu would later give him Ying Prefecture, and Liu agreed. After the Liao subsequently (in stages, both before and after Emperor Taizong's death later in 947) withdrew from Later Jin lands, Liu, who claimed the title of emperor of a new Later Han, entered Kaifeng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. He notified Gao of this. Gao sent an emissary to congratulate the new emperor, and at the same time asked him to fulfill his promise of giving Gao Ying Prefecture. Liu refused, and subsequently, when Liu sent an emissary to bestow honors on Gao, Gao refused to accept the honors. When the Later Han general Du Chongwei later rebelled against Liu at Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Gao took the opportunity to attack Shannan East Circuit, but was repelled by its military governor An Shenqi (). He then attacked Ying, but was repelled by its prefect Yin Shi (). He thereafter cut off his relationship with Later Han, and instead submitted as a vassal to both Southern Tang and Later Shu. Traditional histories used this incident to comment on the peculiar pattern of conduct that both Gao Conghui and his father Gao Jixing had demonstrated throughout Jingnan's existence. As put by the Song Dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu in his New History of the Five Dynasties: However, cutting off relations with Later Han meant that the merchants and the travelers from Later Han stopped visiting Jingnan, which caused economic stress on the small state. In 948, Gao gave in and petitioned Liu's son and successor Liu Chengyou to again submit to Later Han. Liu Chengyou sent an emissary to comfort him. In late 948, Gao fell ill, and had his son and deputy military governor Gao Baorong take over the affairs of the state. He died shortly after.

The western terminus is at the intersection with US 209 located in Cuddebackville, and the eastern terminus is located at Montgomery at NY 17K, where it becomes the main thoroughfare. Through Middletown, it briefly becomes a divided highway with a maximum of five lanes in each direction (a total of ten lanes). It was also through Middletown that the famed \\"Miracle Mile\\" was born, which was the beginning of the shopping center frenzy that saw many businesses move from downtown areas of Middletown to the Route 211 Shopping Corridor. Only in Middletown does the first sign along NY 211 with a directional banner appear, when headed eastward. At that point, the road is running more to the northwest.  Route description  NY 211 between the village of Otisville and city of Middletown NY 211 begins at an intersection with US 209 in the hamlet of Cuddebackville in front of the Rural Valley Cemetery. It proceeds east through Cuddebackville as a two-lane residential roadway, crossing back into the town of Deerpark and crossing over the Basher Kill, where it turns northeast along the creek. The route makes a bend towards the east and crosses over the Metro-North Railroad Port Jervis Line and the southern terminus of County Route 61 (CR 61) as it crosses into the town of Mount Hope. Now known as State Street, NY 211 enters the village of Otisville, bypassing the Otisville Tunnel and bypassing the western reaches of Otisville. Continuing east along the Port Jervis Line tracks, NY 211, enters the center of the village near Highland Avenue. At the junction with Highland, it makes a bend to the north around the eastern portal of the Otisville Tunnel. Running southeast again, it turns out of Otisville and crosses under the tracks near Kelly Hill Road, which connects to the Otisville Metro-North station. Continuing southeast through the town of Mount Hope, the route parallels the railroad tracks past the Shawaganunk Kill. Near the White Bridge Road junction, NY 211 turns southeast away from the tracks and at the junction with Pierson Hill Road, and turns northeast again, soon winding eastward into Baileyville. In Baileyville, the route crosses over the Little Shawaganunk Kill and a junction with the northern terminus of CR 60 (Tally Ho Road). After CR 60, NY 211 turns northeast out of Baileyville and reaches the hamlet of Howells as it crosses into the town of Wallkill. After a large bend to the southeast, the route junctions with CR 18 and begins running southeast along the residential strip northwest of the city of Middletown. Passing Monhagen Lake, NY 211 crosses southeast into the hamlet of Pilgrim Corners, where it junctions with CR 78 and soon enters the city of Middletown. Crossing over a railroad spur, NY 211 enters the city along Monhagen Avenue, a two-lane commercial/residential street in the northwestern section of the city. Several blocks into the city, NY 211 reaches a junction with NY 17M (West Main Street). Paralleling the abandoned Erie Railroad main line through Middletown, NY 211 and NY 17M, now concurrent, turn east along West Main, bypassing the center of Middletown and soon changing names to Wickham Avenue when Main Street forks to the southeast. Bending northeast, NY 17M and NY 211 reach a junction with North Street, where NY 17M turns north onto North while NY 211 continues east on Wickham. NY 211 remains a two-lane commercial street through East Middletown, soon leaving the city for the town of Wallkill. Now without the Wickham Street moniker, the route expands to four lanes through Wallkill, becoming a long commercial boulevard through the town. NY 211 in the Wallkill lowlands between Middletown and Montgomery Bending eastward near Silver Lake, the route gains a center median dividing the two directions before expanding to six lanes. At the junction with the northern terminus of CR 92 (Dunning Road), NY 211 turns northeast and enters exit 120, a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 17 (Future I-86) (the Quickway). The route then turns northeast and crosses the entrance to Galleria at Crystal Run, reaching a junction with Galleria Drive, which connects to the mall and the Middletown- Town of Wallkill Metro-North station. Reduced back to four lanes, NY 211 leaves the mall area and loses the center divide. Passing through the hamlet of Scotchtown, NY 211 crosses a junction with the southern terminus of CR 53 (Blumel Road). Continuing east, the route reduces to two lanes through Wallkill, crossing into the hamlet of Michigan Corners, where it begins to parallel I-84 and the Port Jervis Line. Becoming a two-lane woods road through Wallkill, the route soon enters a wide flat lowlands in the area of Camp Orange Road. The route passes a back entrance to a rest area on I-84 at Bull Road, paralleling the Mannayunk Kill into the town of Montgomery. NY 211 turns northeast and crosses the Wallkill River and passes south of the runway for the Orange County Airport, which is accessible at Dunn Road. Within distance of Dunn Road, NY 211 reaches the northern terminus of NY 416\\\\. Just after NY 416, the route crosses into the village of Montgomery. In the village, NY 211 boasts the name Union Street, crossing northwest through the commercial center of the village. Near River Street, the route bends downhill and crosses through the center of the village. As the route approaches the Wallkill River once again, it reaches a junction with NY 17K (Ward Street) at a t-intersection. This junction marks the eastern terminus of NY 211. History The section of what is now NY 211 from Middletown to Montgomery was first laid out as part of the Minisink and Montgomery Turnpike, chartered in 1809 to build a road from Montgomery to Carpenter's Point, now near Port Jervis. West of Middletown, the road is used, though a section along the Shawangunk Mountains has since been abandoned. The section of this turnpike from North Street (now NY 17M) in Middletown to Montgomery was originally designated as part of NY 8 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY 8 continued south from Middletown to the New Jersey state line at Unionville on modern NY 284 and east from Montgomery to Newburgh on current NY 17K. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the portion of NY 8 southwest of Montgomery was renumbered to NY 84 while a previously unnumbered highway between Cuddebackville and NY 17 (modern NY 17M) in Middletown was designated as NY 211. The NY 84 designation was removed in May 1966 to eliminate numerical duplication with the under-construction Interstate 84\\\\. Its former routing from Middletown to Montgomery became an eastward extension of NY 211. The westernmost portion, according to a historical marker in Cuddebackville, follows the old Mount Hope and Lumberland Turnpike, built during the War of 1812.

The collection is based around the animals of the Amazon rainforest and as such features a variety of exotic animals from South America, including Giant Anteaters, Ocelots, Armadillos, Sloths, Capybara and Tapirs. The zoo originated as a private bird collection and grew into a Zoo Park open to the public all year round. It was once home to the biggest collection of Toucans in the United Kingdom, holding 9 species; this selection has now dwindled down to a single Plate-Billed Mountain Toucan. The zoo has several rescue animals from the private pet trade, other zoos & collections, where they would have been destroyed for varying reasons, and airport seizures & wild caught animals that are unable to be returned to the wild. The zoo also contributes to several breeding programmes and is a leading breeder of Tamandua and Two-toed Sloths. In 2005 the zoo was subject to a nationwide media coverage after a baby penguin was stolen from the zoo overnight. The penguin chick was never found but is presumed to have died after being released into the Solent around the Isle of Wight. Since undergoing new management, the collection has improved remarkably. The zoo is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) for which it undergoes routine inspections to ensure that it is up to standard and providing correct animal welfare in an ecological way. Conservation The zoo contributes to several international breeding programmes including ones for highly endangered species such as the Bali Starling; a species that at one point had a mere 11 left in the wild. It has also had considerable success in breeding the two- toed sloth, a species that is notoriously difficult to breed in captivity. Amazon World Zoo Park also purchase land in South America through the World Land Trust to help conserve the South American natural habitat for the animals they house and care for. Rescue The zoo has a large number of rescue animals within the collection. A large number of their reptile and bird collection are ex-pets and RSPCA rescues that have been donated and rehomed to the zoo where they can receive specialised care and be allowed to live more naturally. They also have a few airport seizures, many of whom have been smuggled into the country for the illegal per trade and have sustained injuries from their capture or transport making them unable to be returned into the wild. Penguin theft Toga was an African penguin who was stolen from the zoo. Toga was the first South African jackass penguin bred at the zoo. On 19 December 2005, burglars stole Toga. It is supposed that the thieves scaled a outer wall before climbing over an metal fence. Katherine Bright, manager at Amazon World at the time, said: \\"Toga was last seen at 4.30pm on Saturday.\\" As the penguin refuses food from humans it is unlikely to survive more than a few days away from it's parents. The zoo initially offered a reward of ¬£1,000, which was swelled by additional offers of money from around the world (including $600 from America). Zoo staff speculated that the film March of the Penguins may have inspired the crime. By Thursday, hopes of finding Toga alive were fading. There was also a caller to the morning television programme GMTV claiming to have dumped the body of Toga in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite the unlikelihood of success on 27 December, the zoo continued to search for the missing penguin. By 17 January 2006, the zoo staff had given up all hope of ever finding the whereabouts of Toga. Toga's parents Kyala and Oscar produced two more eggs early 2006 after recovering from the loss of their first born. On 14 February 2006 one of the eggs hatched, they had a female chick who was named Mumbles. Species Species include Anteaters, Wallabies, Pacas, Kinkajous, Sloths, Frogs, Parrots, Armadillos, Penguins, Meerkats, Carp, Cuckoo amongst many others.

The editor in chief is Stephen Orr. Better Homes and Gardens focuses on interests regarding homes, cooking, gardening, crafts, healthy living, decorating, and entertaining. The magazine is published 12 times per year by the Meredith Corporation. It was founded in 1922 by Edwin Meredith, who had previously been the United States Secretary of Agriculture under Woodrow Wilson. The original name was Fruit, Garden and Home from 1922 to 1924. The name was changed in 1925 to Better Homes and Gardens. Better Homes and Gardens is one of the \\"Seven Sisters\\", a group of women's service magazines. Brand extension The Meredith Corporation publishes a number of books on home economics and gardening under the BH&G; brand, the best known of which is the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book, colloquially known as the \\"Red Plaid\\" book. Now in its 15th edition (published in August 2010), the Red Plaid was originally published in 1930. Meredith also publishes the New Junior Cookbook for children learning to cook. The magazine's title was used by Meredith's real estate arm, which was sold and then called GMAC Real Estate. In October 2007, Meredith entered a 50-year licensing agreement with Realogy Corporation to license the Better Homes and Gardens name to Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate. The company is based in Parsippany, New Jersey, and has offices across the country. Meredith's broadcasting division began producing the television program Better in the fall of 2007, which is a lifestyle show which has a mix of content from Meredith's various magazine titles (included BH&G;), consumer advice and celebrity interviews. The program currently airs on stations owned by Meredith, Scripps, Fisher and LIN TV groups. Some Meredith-owned stations produce their own local edition of Better. The brand offers a line of home decor products through a partnership with Home Interiors and Gifts, a company based on direct selling. Overseas editions An Australian edition is also published, under licence, by Pacific Magazines and there is also a television show which airs on the Seven Network. The Australian edition is the 6th best selling consumer magazine in Australia. The Australian edition has been publishing since July 1978. References in popular culture Mad Magazine published a satire in 1958 (issue #53) titled \\"Bitter Homes and Gardens,\\" including articles titled \\"They Built Their House on a Lot 22 Inches Wide\\" (A house built between two office buildings); a \\"How-The...\\" department which suggests putting a lawn on rollers so one can drag it \\"to a nearby spot where it's raining\\"; and an article on how to convert a second bathroom into a basement (with a photo of the author's wife, who has just stepped out of the shower and covers herself with a towel). The magazine was also spoofed in the 1970s as \\"Bitter Homes and Garbage\\", in a set of \\"Crazy Magazine Covers\\" produced by Fleer. In an episode of I Love Lucy, Lucy jokes about the magazine as, \\"Better Homes and Garbage\\" when she and Ethel redecorate Lucy's apartment. An episode of The Simpsons showed a brief shot of a magazine entitled Better Homes Than Yours. Better Homes and Gardens is mentioned in the song \\"I Save Cigarette Butts\\" by the American band P, consisting of Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, Johnny Depp, Sal Jenco, and Bill Carter.

These volumes were intended to provide a detailed representation of thousands of individual occupations in the United States, for the purpose of occupational information, occupational exploration, and job placement. The Social Security Administration was particularly interested in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the SCO for the purpose of establishing the existence of jobs that a claimant for disability benefits could otherwise perform despite his or her mental and/or physical impairments during disability adjudication within the Social Security Administration. The Dictionary of Occupational Titles was insufficient for disability adjudication at the Social Security Administration because it did not include enough detail about the physical and environmental demands of the jobs listed therein. Accordingly, the Social Security Administration requested that the Department of Labor produce a companion volume to the DOT, which would publish data collected as part of the DOT research, but not previously available. This document is known as the \\"SCO\\" or Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles.Social Security Disability Advocate's Handbook, by David Traver, James Publishing, 2008, The Social Security Administration's Interest in the SCO In 1960, Kerner v. Flemming, 283 F.2d 916, 921 (2d Cir. 1960) held that there must be a \\"rational decision\\" regarding the vocational issues. In response to Kerner and the underling demand for rationality inherent in District Court review, the SSA undertook a search for vocational evidence to support its disability determinations. Prior to the publication of the Fourth Edition of the DOT, the Social Security Administration requested estimates of worker traits from the Bureau of Employment Security. \\"There was also widespread interest among vocational consultants in an abstract of worker traits and physical requirements for occupations such as the Estimates of Worker Trait Requirements for 4,000 jobs, which had been published with the second edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Basic information about the physical capacities, working conditions, general educational development and specific vocational preparation requirements for the individual jobs could be ascertained by referral to this work. However, such information was needed in more accessible form for vocational assessment, therefore, the Bureau of Disability Insurance entered into an arrangement whereby the Bureau of Employment Security compiled and published a Supplement to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Microfilmed data about occupations furnished by the Labor Department was punched into IBM cards by the Social Security Administration's Division of Accounting Operations. Thus, it was possible to abstract selected data about occupations that would be useful for vocational evaluation. This Supplement, entitled Selected Characteristics of Occupations, was published in 1966 and proved to be a valuable tool in supplementing information provided by a disability claimant regarding his past work and in identifying jobs for which he could qualify.\\" History Page SSA Online As a result of this work, Social Security Administration's Ruling SSR 00-4p and prior Regulations explain: \\"In making disability determinations, we rely primarily on the DOT (including its companion publication, the SCO) for information about the requirements of work in the national economy. We use these publications at steps 4 and 5 of the sequential evaluation process.\\"Selected Characteristics of Occupations, United States Department of Labor, Germania Publishing, 2008.

It covers the main part of the upper basin of the Wis≈Çoka river. When the Park was created in 1995 it covered 199.62 km¬≤, although it is now only , of which 185.31 km¬≤ is forest. The Park takes its name from the massif known as Magura WƒÖtkowska, after WƒÖtkowa, its highest peak. Magura is also the name of the second-highest peak of this massif. The landscape Magurski National Park's landscape is typical of the Beskid Niski ridge and consists mainly of heavily forested low and medium peaks. The park features fancifully sculpted rocks. The huge Devil's Rock wrapped in mystery is the most prominent among these rock formations. The main part of the park consists of the Magura WƒÖtkowska massif, with its highest peak WƒÖtkowa at above sea level. Other significant hills are Magura (842 m), Wielka G√≥ra (719 m) and Nad Tysowym (713 m). The Wis≈Çoka river and its tributaries are some of the most important elements of the park. The Wis≈Çoka is a typical mountain river, which creates picturesque ravines and frequently changes its course. The Kornuty nature reserve is located at the heart of the park, protecting the constellations of its fancifully sculpted sandstones. Their unusual shapes are due to erosion. The rocks conceal numerous fracture caves, including the best known Mroczna [Murky] Cave, whose corridors are 200 metres long. Flora and fauna Plant life is of a transitional character and reflects the park's location - between the Eastern and Western Carpathians. The majority of the Park is forest. Spruce is not frequent here, which means that the woodland is for the most part natural. Animal life is very rich in the Park - there are 137 species of birds, including several endangered such as the eagle and eagle-owl as well as the stork. There are also 35 endangered mammal species including the brown bear (they roam back and forth between Poland and Slovakia), lynx, wildcat, wolf and otter. One can also find fish, snakes, salamanders and numerous insects. It is estimated that within the Park there are 200 species of endangered animals. Human settlement The oldest trace of human settlement in this area are remains of a stronghold at Brzezowa, on the Walik mountain. It was part of the system of strongholds built by the Wislanie tribe in the 9th century on the Southern border of their lands. Also, one can find small, wooden Orthodox churches, which were built by the eastern Slavic Lemkos. Unfortunately, some of these buildings are ruined. In one of the farmers‚Äô huts, at the village of Kolonia Olchowiec, there is a small, private museum of Lemko culture. There are also numerous cemeteries from World War I, as this area was for a long time a battleground between the Russian and Austro-German armies. A tragic reminder of World War II is the cemetery of 1250 Jews, who were killed by the Nazis in 1942 at the Halb√≥w pass. The Park has its headquarters in the village of Krempna.

The concept has some antecedents in Brezhnev's foreign policy, who used the phrase during a visit to Bonn in 1981. However, at this time it was likely used in an attempt to sow discord between the United States and the European allies in the hopes of moderating American policy.Neil Malcolm. \\"The 'Common European Home' and Soviet European Policy.\\" International Affairs. 65(4) 1989. p. 662 Though Gorbachev used a similar phrase in a 1985 statement, calling the Old World \\"our common house,\\"Christian Schmidt-H√§uer. Gorbachev: The Path to Power. London: I.B. Tauris. p. 144 perhaps the most famous use of the term arose when Gorbachev presented his concept of \\"our common European home\\" or the \\"all-European house\\" during a visit to Czechoslovakia in April 1987. In his main address in Prague he declared: :We assign an overriding significance to the European course of our foreign policy.... We are resolutely against the division of the continent into military blocs facing each other, against the accumulation of military arsenals in Europe, against everything that is the source of the threat of war. In the spirit of the new thinking we introduced the idea of the \\"all- European house\\"... [which] signifies, above all, the acknowledgment of a certain integral whole, although the states in question belong to different social systems and are members of opposing military-political blocs standing against each other. This term includes both current problems and real possibilities for their solution.Milan Svec. \\"The Prague Spring: 20 Years Later.\\" Foreign Affairs. Summer 1988. At the time, Eastern European analysts viewed this rhetoric as a way for Gorbachev to prevent an outright revolt of Eastern European countries from the Soviet bloc. Jim Hoagland wrote that Gorbachev's \\"Common European Home\\" and Bush's \\"Europe Whole and Free\\" were competing concepts describing the same situation: an economic and ideological collapse of Soviet power concurrent with the European Community gaining new dynamism and economic clout.Jim Hoagland. \\"Europe's Destiny.\\" Foreign Affairs. 1989/1990. On June 12, 1989, General Secretary Gorbachev arrived in Bonn, and held private talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizs√§cker. The following day, Kohl and Gorbachev signed a joint declaration supporting national self-determination, mutual reduction in nuclear and conventional forces, and a \\"Common European Home\\" in which Canada and the United States have a role. He also stated that by appropriating Charles de Gaulle's \\"Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals\\" geographical definition, Gorbachev was attempting to keep the Soviet Union presence prescribed.\\"Chronology 1989; East-West Relations.\\" Foreign Affairs. Fall 1989-1990. pp. 230 In his July 6, 1989, speech before the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Gorbachev declared: :The philosophy of the \\"Common European Home\\" concept rules out the probability of an armed clash and the very possibility of the use of force or threat of force - alliance against alliance, inside the alliances, wherever. This philosophy suggests that a doctrine of restraint should take the place of the doctrine of deterrence. This is not just a play on words but the logic of European development prompted by life itself. On November 29, 1989, General Secretary Gorbachev, en route to the upcoming Malta summit with President George H.W. Bush, arrived in Italy. He gave a speech the next day at the Rome city hall in which he sketched out the notion of the \\"Common European Home\\" as a commonwealth of sovereign and economically interdependent nations. He then also proposed a 1990 meeting of CSCE, and met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican the following day. At the time, analysts such as Robert D. Hormats saw the nascent European Community as primely positioned to take on the role of a Common European Home due to its \\"moral, political and social - as well as economic - strength.\\"Robert D. Hormats. \\"Redefining Europe and the Atlantic Link.\\" Foreign Affairs. Fall 1989. Ronald D.

Victoria Arana, \\"Cheney-Coker, Syl\\", in Encyclopedia of World Poetry, Infobase Learning, 2015. is a poet, novelist, and journalist from Freetown, Sierra Leone. Educated in the United States, he has a global sense of literary history, and has introduced styles and techniques from French and Latin American literatures to Sierra Leone. He has spent much of his life in exile from his native country, and has written extensively (in poetry, fiction, and non-fiction) about the condition of exile and the view of Africa from an African abroad. Early life and education Cheney-Coker was born a Creole in Freetown, Sierra Leone, with the name Syl Cheney Coker, and changed his name to its current spelling in 1970.Clarke, George Elliot, Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002), 128. He went to the United States in 1966, where he attended the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Oregon, and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. After his schooling he returned briefly to Sierra Leone, but accepted a position at the University of the Philippines in 1975; he later married a Filipino woman.Hallowell, Gbanabom, \\"The Claustrophobia of Exile: African Poets Writing in the 'Wasteland'\\" (Sea Breeze: Journal of Contemporary Liberian Writings Vol. 3, No. 1 [2006]). He moved to Nigeria in 1977 to teach at the University of Maiduguri, and returned to the United States in 1988 to be Writer-in-Residence at the University of Iowa. Poetry Cheney-Coker's poetry is tinged with the anxiety of his perennially uncertain status, dealing both with exile (he has spent the majority of his adult life outside of his country) and with the precariousness of living as an intellectual in Sierra Leone. At the same time, he is concerned always with how he will be read; his poems are radical and ardent, but also erudite and allusive, which can distract a reader from Cheney-Coker's ideological project. He has been called one of the more western-influenced African poets.Riemenschneider, Dieter, African Literatures in the Eighties (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1993), 82. In his \\"On Being a Poet in Sierra Leone\\" (from his The Graveyard Also Has Teeth, 1980) he writes: :at the university the professors talk about the poetry of Syl Cheney-Coker condemning students to read me in the English honours class my country I do not want that! do not want to be cloistered in books aloneMoore, Gerald, and Ulli Beier, The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry, 4th edition (London: Penguin, 1998), 339. The Last Harmattan of Alusine Dunbar After three collections of poetry, all well received in the west, Cheney-Coker wrote a novel, The Last Harmattan of Alusine Dunbar, which was published in 1990. The novel, extremely ambitious in scale and scope, describes the entire history of a fictional country, Malagueta, with roots in the Atlantic slave trade (similar to Sierra Leone or Liberia, both populated partly by former slaves). The novel is intended as a break with the tradition of the African novel and its dominant writers, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o and Chinua Achebe.Bertinetti, Paolo, \\"Reality in Magic in Syl Cheney-Coker's The Last Harmattan of Alusine Dunbar,\\" in Linguanti, Elsa et al., ed., Coterminous Worlds: Magical Realism and Contemporary Post-colonial Literature in English (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1999), 199. To achieve this independence, it draws both on the peculiar histories of the post-slavery nations of northwest Africa and on literatures from outside of the continent. Cheney-Coker's interest in Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, in particular, has led some critics to consider the novel to belong to the genre of magical realism‚Äîthe title character demonstrates mysterious powers similar to those of some of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's characters‚Äîthough others have questioned that assumption.Olatubosun Ogunsanwo, for example, challenges that interpretation in his review of Brenda Cooper's Magical Realism in West African Fiction: Seeing with a Third Eye (Research in African Literatures Vol. 31 No. 2 [2000], 226‚Äì228). Bertinetti quotes some ambivalent statements by Cheney-Coker himself, and argues for a middle view (199‚Äì200).

Journalism and exile In the early 1990s, Cheney-Coker returned to Freetown to become editor of a progressive newspaper, the Vanguard. After the military coup of 1997, Cheney- Coker was targeted as a dissident, and barely escaped with his life.Schaeffer, Glen, \\"Battling Censorship, One Writer at a Time\\" (International Institute of Modern Letters, Rainmaker Report Winter 2003/2004), 1. In part through the efforts of Wole Soyinka, an exiled Nigerian poet teaching at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Cheney-Coker was invited to be the first writer in the City of Asylum program in Las Vegas, Nevada. He decided to return to a somewhat more stable Sierra Leone in 2003, saying, \\"After a while, exile is neither justifiable nor tolerable.\\"Morrison, Jane Ann, \\"Symbol of Freedom: Exiled Writer: Time is Right to Go Home\\", Las Vegas Review Journal, 17 January 2003.

At 17 he received a full factory ride from Team Yamaha. He has raced for many factory teams and holds several titles, back to back AMA 125 West Supercross Championships in 1996 and 1997, the 2005 Motocross des Nations team championship, and 2nd in points for the 2008 supercross season. In 1999 Windham won the United States Grand Prix of Motocross held at Budd's Creek, Maryland. Despite his longtime status as one of the world's fastest motocross racers, he is yet to win a major (250cc or 450cc) National or World Championship. He is better known by the nickname K-Dub on the racing scene. He announced his retirement from racing at the third round of the 2013 Supercross season. Personal Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Windham began riding motorcycles from the age of three with friends in the spillways around the New Orleans area. He is married to Dottie. They met at around age twelve, when Dottie went with her sister to watch a race at the local motocross track. The couple have four children; daughters Madelyn, Annabelle and Elizabeth, and son Kevin Jr. Windham lists his non-motocross hobbies as \\"anything outdoors\\", including bmx, fishing and flying his own plane. Windham is known by the nickname K Dub. Mattel released a Hot Wheels model of Kevin Windham on a 2000 Honda CR250 in 2001. Amateur experience The 1994 AMA Amateur and Youth National Motocross Championships, at Loretta Lynn‚Äôs Dude Ranch, was the venue for Windham‚Äôs final races as an amateur. He won both the 125cc A Modified and the 250cc Open A Modified classes, setting a new lap record, taking out his seventh and eighth amateur national titles, and extending his personal winning streak at Loretta Lynn‚Äôs to eighteen consecutive motos. Professional career Hot Wheels model of KDub on #14 Windham riding for Geico Powersports Honda At Glen Helen Raceway, in San Bernardino, California, in 2009 Kevin Windham has been described as \\"arguably the best rider to have never won a National Championship\\". Regarded as one of the most naturally talented riders competing in motocross and supercross, Windham has finished second in the overall points standings five times, without once winning. Though one of the oldest riders on the track in 2011, his acknowledged class, grace, and riding ability make him a favourite with the fans. In 1994 Windham turned professional midway through the season, riding a Kawasaki. He was awarded the AMA Rookie of the Year award, and after an impressive performance at Mt. Morris, PA, where he nearly beat Doug Henry for the moto win, he was signed by Team Yamaha. In 1995 Windham took five podium finishes in the 125cc East Region Supercross Series, with a best result of second at Minneapolis. He finished that series in 5th overall. He also had some strong performances in the outdoor nationals with a top 125cc Motocross finish of fifth at Delmont, PA. 1996 was a breakthrough year for Windham, with six supercross wins he scored his first 125cc West Coast Championship. Later that year he won four 125cc Nationals and placed second to Steve Lamson in the championship. In 1997 Windham had another strong season. He won all but two rounds of the 125 West Region Supercross series and earned his second title in as many years. He also had 125cc National Motocross overall wins at Buchanan, MI, New Berlin, NY, and Delmont, PA. Windham also made history by winning a 250cc Supercross main event in Charlotte, NC while still a full-time 125cc rider. He was the first person, and so far only, in motocross history to do this. In 1998 Windham moved to the 250cc class full-time for Yamaha and won the New Orleans and St. Louis 250cc Supercross rounds. he took five additional podium finishes and finished outside the top-10 just once in the 1998 Supercross series. He finished 4th overall. He took podium finishes in the 250cc Motocross National races at Budds Creek, MD, and New Berlin, NY, but failed to score an overall victory. He broke his leg at the Washougal, WA, event and withdrew from the series. After a bitter contract dispute, Kevin Windham signed with Team Honda for the 1999 season. In the 1999 season, after some initial struggles adapting to his new Honda, Windham hit his stride and won two Supercross main events and four motocross Nationals. He finished the outdoor season ranked second behind Greg Albertyn. Windham and Sebastien Tortelli both posed strong challenges to Albertyn all season, but eventually came up short. It is regarded as one of the most competitive motocross seasons ever. However, A high point of kevin's motocross career came in 1999. Kevin decided to race the USGP being held at Budd's Creek, MD only three days prior to the event. European Champion and motocross hero overseas Stefan Everts made a comment concerning the top US racers deciding not to race the GP, rather to focus on the US races and the time off the week end allowed. Everts said he thought the US racers were being cowards. This angered Kevin Windham greatly. Stefan Everts at the time was one of the toughest racers to beat. Kevin went on to dominate the race and left no doubt that Everts had nothing for him on that day. This race was very emotional for Kevin and it took years for Kevin to finally say he was okay with Stefan Everts. Kevin put the motorcycle he won that race on his trophy room, suspended from the ceiling. The 2000 season was more of a challenge to Windham, as he scored just one supercross victory at Dallas, TX, and lost both the supercross title to Jeremy McGrath and the outdoor title to Ricky Carmichael, who was in his rookie 250cc National season. For 2001, hoping for a positive change, Windham switched to Team Suzuki. It was a tough season, as it saw the beginning of Carmichael's domination for years to come. Windham did turn things around outdoors though, winning six motos. A titanic duel at the Washougal National between Carmichael and Windham is known as one of the best races ever, with Windham gaining the upper hand in both motos. He also won the season finale at Delmont, PA. In 2002, he began the season for Team Sobe Suzuki with a broken finger, and had difficulty adjusting to the race situation with crowds and lights. He also had problems with fitness, suffering arm pump, and fired his trainer. Windham broke his femur in a horrific crash in Atlanta. Windham did not return to the circuit that season and many speculated that he would retire at the young age of 23, however the enforced rest allowed him to fully recover mentally and physically. In 2003, Windham missed the supercross series to spend time with Dottie and their new-born daughter. After over a year off, Windham announced his comeback for the 250cc Nationals aboard a Factory Connection Honda CRF450R. With an emphasis on having fun and just enjoying the sport, Windham rode better than ever before, claiming two overall victories at Unadilla and Washougal, and finishing on the podium at all but two events. He placed second to the champion Carmichael and cemented his status as a fan favorite. Carmichael withdrew from the 2004 Supercross season for knee surgery. After a long battle with Yamaha's Chad Reed, Windham claimed 5 victories but still finished second to Reed in the title chase. By his standards, Windham had a mediocre summer and failed to win any races, finishing a distant third in the championship. In 2005, several weeks before the start of the season Kevin's mechanic, Jonathan, committed suicide. Windham went on to win the muddy opening round in Anaheim. After a season long battle, he ended third in the championship behind Carmichael and Reed, but ahead of James Stewart. Windham won just one moto that summer at Unadilla, but was the only rider who could keep Carmichael in sight and finished 2nd overall once again. Teamed with Carmichael and 125cc Champion Ivan Tedesco, Windham helped his team win the 2005 Motocross des Nations in Ernee, France. Before the 2006 season Kevin Windham broke his arm in training and returned near the end of the supercross season. He rode a consistent outdoor series to finish a strong second overall once again. The 2007 Supercross season was lackluster for Windham, he had some good races and podium finishes, but went winless to end the season 4th overall. Carmichael had switched to a partial schedule, and Windham was beaten by eventual champion Stewart, Reed and Tim Ferry. The outdoor season began with similar results, with Kevin finishing off the podium. But once the series headed to Unadilla, Windham broke through with his first outdoor overall victory since 2003 and first moto win since 2005. Windham would win the final moto of the season at Glen Helen Raceway. His series was up and down, and he finished a close 5th overall. 2008 would be one of Kevin's best supercross seasons ever. He never once finished outside the top 5, and finished up the season with 4 overall victories, including the Daytona supercross. The Daytona race was one of the most difficult in memory, as torrential rain flooded the course, making for treacherous conditions. Windham would take the win after Chad Reed's bike quit with just a few turns to go. As the season went on, Windham would pressure Reed extremely hard, and proved to be the fastest rider near the end of the series, but ended up falling a few points short of the title. He again finished 2nd in the championship. 2009 for Kevin has been nothing but bad luck for the Geico powersports honda rider. Kevin collided with James Stewart in the season opener while running in the top 5, finishing 15th. And a DNF in Indianapolis, while he was running in a strong in 3rd. In the 2010 supercross series Kevin once again showed he had what it takes to contend despite his age. He held the fastest qualifying times at a number of events including Atlanta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida. He found himself on the podium more than once. Windham won two consecutive races at one point, in Seattle and Salt Lake City. At the end of 2010 he signed a two-year extension to his contract with Geico Powersports Honda. In 2011 Windham finished the Supercross season in seventh position. He rode the first half of the 450 Class Motocross Championship, filling in for injured Honda riders Trey Canard and Josh Grant, achieving a number of top-10 finishes. He volunteered to join GEICO Honda teammates Justin Barcia and Eli Tomac to replace Christophe Pourcel, injured two weeks before, at the 29th annual Supercross of Bercy at Omnisport Paris, however he was unable to finalize travel documents in time. In 2012 Windham continues with Geico Powersports Honda, entering his 19th season as a professional motocross racer. However, while battling with James Stewart, Jr. on the Final Lap during Heat of Round 13 at Houston, Windham crashed hard and suffered several injuries. Consequently, Windham will be out for the remainder of the 2012 Supercross Season. In 2018 Windham took part at the most prestigious motocross event in the world known as the Motocross of Nations representing none other than Puerto Rico, he was invited to be part of the team by long time friend, extreme sports icon and Nitro Circus ring leader Travis Pastrana, Pastrana's Puerto Rican roots made him want to raise awareness for the situation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and made it his duty to do something about it. He contacted Gabriel Catala from the Puerto Rican motorcycling federation and it all took off from there. The team consisted of Travis Pastrana, Ryan Sipes and Kevin Windham. The team ultimately won the B-Final to make it to the main event, making them the most popular team at Red Bud Motocross during the event. =Career Highlights= * 2010 2nd (SX) * 2008 2nd (SX) * 2006 2nd (250MX) * 2005 3rd (SX), 2nd (250MX), team 1st Motocross des Nations * 2004 2nd (SX), 3rd (250MX) * 2003 2nd (250MX) * 2001 2nd (250MX) * 2000 3rd (250MX) * 1999 2nd (250MX) * 1997 1st (WSX), 2nd (125MX) * 1996 1st (WSX), 2nd (125MX) References Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American motorcycle racers Category:Motocross riders Category:People from Centreville, Mississippi Category:Sportspeople from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:X Games athletes ","title":"Kevin Windham"},{"id":"3911807","text":"Bald Eagle State Forest is a Pennsylvania state forest in Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry District #7. The main office is located in Laurelton in Union County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The forest is found in Centre, Clinton, Mifflin, Snyder, and Union Counties. Bald Eagle shares a common border on its western extent with Rothrock State Forest and on its northern extent with Tiadaghton State Forest. Five Pennsylvania State Parks are contained within the forest: Poe Valley, Poe Paddy, R. B. Winter, Reeds Gap, and Sand Bridge, as well as two former state parks: Snyder-Middleswarth Natural Area (formerly Snyder-Middleswarth State Park) and Hairy Johns Picnic Area (formerly a state park known as both \\"Hairy John's State Forest Park\\" and \\"Voneida State Forest Park\\"). History Bald Eagle State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Events Various events are held in Bald Eagle each year including the Wilderness 101, a mountain bike race.

Background The work is written as a dialogue between prominent figures of the Middle Roman Republic and is set after the death of the younger Scipio Africanus (otherwise known as Scipio Aemilianus, Scipio Africanus Minor or Scipio the Younger) in 129 BC. The interlocutors of the dialogue chosen by Cicero are Gaius Laelius, a close friend of the late statesman, and Laelius's two sons- in-law, Gaius Fannius, and Quintus Mucius Scaevola. Cicero in his youth knew Scaevola, and states that Scaevola described to him the substance of the conversation on Friendship which he and Fannius had held with Laelius a few days after the death of Scipio. De Amicitia is addressed to Atticus, who, as Cicero tells him in his dedication, could not fail to discover his own portrait in the study of a perfect friend. Summary In the dialogue Fannius, the historian, and Mucius Scaevola, the Augur, both sons-in-law of Laelius, pay him a visit immediately after the sudden and suspicious death of Scipio Africanus. The loss which Laelius had thus sustained leads to a eulogy on the virtues of the departed hero, and to a discussion on the nature of their friendship. Many of the sentiments which Laelius utters are declared by Scaevola to have originally flowed from Scipio, with whom the nature and laws of friendship formed a favourite topic of discourse. > But I must at the very beginning lay down this principle‚Äîfriendship can only > exist between good men. ‚Ä¶We mean then by the \\"good\\" those whose actions and > lives leave no question as to their honour, purity, equity, and liberality; > who are free from greed, lust, and violence; and who have the courage of > their convictions.Marcus Tullius Cicero.

He is the author of three books. He is a former member of the San Francisco Chinatown gang that was responsible for the 1977 Golden Dragon massacre. Biography Lee grew up in San Francisco's Chinatown, and went to Marina Middle School, Galileo High School and was a student majoring in psychology at San Francisco State University when he joined the Chung Ching Yee, also known as the Joe Boys. Although not indicted, he was questioned by homicide investigators about the 1977 Golden Dragon massacre. The massacre was one of the deadliest in San Francisco History, for which five other Joe Boys were jailed after injuring 15 people and killing 5 others. In 1988, Lee was an employee at ESL when former employee Richard Farley fatally shot seven people and wounded four others at its headquarters. Lee recalled the tragedy in detail and his role in rescuing coworkers in his first book, Chinese Playground: A Memoir.Notes from the Underworld Announcement of the book's publication was featured on the front page of The San Francisco Examiner and as the cover story in AsianWeek. Shortly after Chinese Playground was released, the author and Sergeant Dan Foley of the SFPD's Asian Gang Task Force appeared on KPIX's Bay Sunday (CBS affiliate) where they discussed the book and the Golden Dragon massacre.  Career  Lee is the author of three books. His first, Chinese Playground: A Memoir (1999) is a memoir of gang life in 1960s and 1970s San Francisco Chinatown which caused him to be approached and threatened by former gang associates who told him he should not have written the book and made veiled threats against him and his family. He is also the author of Born to Lose: Memoirs of a Compulsive Gambler, (2005) which details his 40-year gambling addiction and recovery. Lee's latest book is Born-Again Buddhist. He has written numerous articles for the San Francisco Chronicle and AsianWeek and has been featured on the History Channel, A&E;, Spike, FOX network, PBS, Radio Television Hong Kong, NPR, and in national print publications.

Population: History The origin of Pochep is unknown but it was mentioned in the 15th century as an important town of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It fell into the hands of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1503. Pochep was returned to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth under the terms of the Truce of Deulino. It was part of the Smolensk Voivodeship. Pochep remained of little significance until 1709, when Hetman Ivan Skoropadsky made a grant of it to Alexander Menshikov. The latter founded the fort of Alexandropolis in the vicinity and launched manufacture of sails for Russian ships in Pochep. The industry declined following Menshikov's downfall and the town stagnated until 1750, when it passed to another Hetman, Kirill Razumovsky, who planned to build his summer residence there. The only monument to these plans is the Resurrection Church, built in the 1750s to a confident Baroque design and often attributed to Antonio Rinaldi. Resurrection Church in Pochep During World War II, Pochep was occupied by the German Army from August 22, 1941 to September 21, 1943.

First opened in 1972,http://www.stvrain.k12.co.us/schools/nhs/#history Niwot High School has been a part of the community for over 40 years. The school's original construction was delayed, so for the first semester of the 1972‚Äì73 school year students attended classes at the Longmont High School building after regular hours. Niwot High School was finished on December 22, 1972. The first class of students was given the honor to choose the school's colors, mascot, and motto. These were two students from each class that was to attend the new school. The colors were kelly green and silver, the mascot was a cougar named \\"Carrie\\", and the motto was \\"Our Pride is Our Life\\". There were no seniors in the first year because the district did not want to remove current seniors from their home schools to finish their final year in a new school. Thus, the class of 1974 was the first graduating class, and the class of 1976 was the first to have been at Niwot for all four years. The football and baseball team won the conference championship their second year.Longmont Daily Times-Call, December 1972 The school has had several additions since it was originally constructed; the new commons, auditorium, large gym, and a large portion of the lower wing were added after the school was originally built.

As the mouth of the net is kept open by the lateral pull of the individual vessels, otter boards are not required. With the towing power of two boats and no otter boards, a larger net may be worked than would otherwise be possible, or alternatively, the two boats can share increased fuel efficiency. As doors are not necessary, the gear arrangements are simplified, with the warps attaching directly to the wings of the net. Setting and hauling of the nets are carried out by one boat, while the other is only used for towing; usually each will take turns at these operations. Pair trawling is effective on all demersal species. In shallow waters, where the noise from a single vessel may scatter fish, two vessels operating a distance apart tend to herd fish into the path of the net. Catch per vessel often considerably exceeds that attainable through standard bottom trawling. Pair trawlers targeting cod off the coast of New England have reported average per vessel catches of three to six times that from single trawls.Sainsbury, J.C. (1996) Commercial Fishing Methods (3rd edition). Fishing News Books, Oxford, UK. Because of the increased efficiency of pair trawling, vessels are able to tow their gears in mid-water at a faster speed to target species which are normally able to escape trawl nets, such as the European seabass. This has caused some controversy, due to the high level of marine mammal bycatch associated, leading to the British government introducing a ban on pair trawling for bass in UK territorial waters.The South-west Territorial Waters (Prohibition of Pair Trawling) (Amendment) Order 2005 References * Thomson, David: Pair trawling and pair seining.

Toponymy Greenslopes was named after an early estate in the area. The estate was owned by Frederick Wecker, who purchased the land in 1857 and named it after the area's green pastures.  History  Steven's Hill, Greenslopes, looking towards Junction Park School, 1940s Parts of the current suburb were originally opened for settlement under names such as the Dunellan, Thompson and Mount Pleasant Estates. There is still a Dunellan Street in the suburb, adjacent to the state school. Greenslopes formed part of Stephens Shire until its amalgamation with over 20 other local shires into Greater Brisbane in 1925. The shire's name can still be seen on a plaque on the bridge where Juliette Street crosses Norman Creek. The Brisbane City Council operated trams along Logan Road, through Greenslopes until 13 April 1969. Until 1957 a tram line also operated along Chatsworth Road, branching off the Logan Road line at Greenslopes. In October 1925, 23 allotments bordered by Holland Street, Donaldson Street and Curd Street, were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love & Co, Limited. A map advertising the auction shows the nearby tram line on Chatsworth Road. St Matthew's Anglican Church hall opened circa 1936 and closed circa 1968. In September 1938, \\"Waratah Estate\\", made up of eight allotments bordered by Logan Road and Donaldson Street, were advertised to be auctioned by Sharp & Musgrave. A map advertising the auction states that the allotments are on the Holland Park tramline. Chatsworth Heights Estate bordering Logan Road was auctioned on the Saturday 14 June 1914. Many of the dwellings in the suburb of Greenslopes are 'character homes' of pre-war construction. Brisbane City Council purportedly recognises pre-war homes as being valuable to the identity of the suburb and enforces controls relating to the demolition and renovation of the original homes, whilst also ensuring that any new dwellings built in the suburb are reflective of traditional architecture and maintain and enhance the character of the streetscape. However, two- and three-story walk-up apartment buildings are increasingly the norm. Before August 2015, Greenslopes was in Holland Park Ward but from August 2015 it is in the new Coorparoo Ward with Annerley, Coorparoo, Camp Hill and Carina Heights. Geography Greenslopes lies south-east of the Brisbane central business district. There is some slight variety in the terrain, with low hills in the east and south sloping down to the flood plain of Norman Creek, which curls around the western and northern edges of the suburb on its way to join the Brisbane River at Norman Park. The major roads are: * Logan Road; * The Southeast Freeway. Both Freeway and Logan Road are oriented northwest-southeast and lead from inner Brisbane to the city of Logan and other points south; * Chatsworth Road, joining Greenslopes to suburbs further east, including Coorparoo, Camp Hill and Carina; * Old Cleveland Road, a major arterial road which also leads eastwards but reaches almost to the shores of Moreton Bay; * the South-East Busway, which tends to parallel the course of Norman Creek with Greenslopes busway station providing frequent and rapid services to the city; * Henzell Terrace, atop one of Greenslope's highest hills, which probably contains the greatest concentration of the suburb's more expensive homes. =Stephens Mountain= Stephens Mountain is one of Brisbane's largest hills. It is located in Greenslopes, between the Greenslopes Private Hospital located on a ridge leading east from its highest point, and the Greenslopes busway station and the Pacific Motorway to the west. The hill is low and its highest points are still covered in scrub. Norman Creek drains the areas surrounding the mountain. =Climate= Greenslopes shares Brisbane's humid sub-tropical climate, but the hot summer days are often mitigated by cooling afternoon breezes, especially in the higher areas. Winters are usually drier with very mild temperatures. Demographics Diva Zion Synagogue in Greenslopes Maronite (Lebanese) Catholic Church in Greenslopes The 2011 Census recorded 8,565 residents in Greenslopes, of whom 50.8% were female and 49.2% were male. The median age of the population was 32; five years younger than the Australian median. 64.1% of people living in Greenslopes were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%. The other most common countries of birth were India (4.3%), England (3.2%), New Zealand (3.1%), the Philippines (1.1%), and China (0.8%). 74% of people only spoke English at home, while the next most commonly spoken languages were Punjabi (1.2%), Hindi (1.1%), Mandarin (1.1%), Cantonese (0.9%), and Greek (0.9%). The most common religious affiliation was Catholic (25.7%), followed by 'No Religion' (25%), Anglican (12%), Uniting Church (3.8%), and Buddhist (3%). The suburb's population density was 2,913/km¬≤, whereas Brisbane's was 140/km¬≤. Most occupied dwellings were apartments (48.7%), followed by separate houses (42.6%). Landmarks Greenslopes Private Hospital The local shopping precinct is Greenslopes Mall on Logan Road. The Greenslopes Private Hospital, formerly Repatriation General Hospital (RGH) Greenslopes operated by the Commonwealth Government Dept of Veterans Affairs (DVA) for war veterans is located within the suburb. The hospital, surrounded by quiet streets, lies some distance from the nearest main roads, a factor which has caused friction with local residents over traffic, parking and redevelopment issues in recent years. Other longstanding local landmarks are the Greenslopes State School and Greenslopes Bowls Club. =Stones Corner= Logan Road, Stones Corner, a precinct notable for Iraqi and other Middle Eastern cafes, butcher shops and other services, factory outlets and its Middle Eastern and Northeast African population. Stones Corner is a former Greenslopes locality (now a separately designated suburb) known for its assortment of ethnic communities, ethnic retail food outlets and several sidewalk restaurants and caf√©s ‚Äî Italian, Indian, Turkish and others ‚Äî located on Logan Road near where it crosses Norman Creek. The community is notable for its factory outlets and its longstanding large population of Indians, Iraqis and other Middle Easterners, Somali and other Northeast Africans and more recently, Punjabis, particularly of Sikh religious affiliation, who have flowed into the community as a result of recent changes in federal immigration policy.

University of Cincinnati, 1992. p. 1 The cycle is framed by a prologue The Princess of the Stars and an epilogue And Wolf Shall Inherit the Moon, and includes ten other major works. All twelve of the works place heavy emphasis on the location of performance. The third production in the series, Patria 3: The Greatest Show, was adapted into the film Carnival of Shadows. The cycle is in a continual state of evolution as participants of And Wolf Shall Inherit the Moon return to perform the work each summer, revising the content of the performance to accommodate the current environment of the site and needs of the performance community. History In 1966, Schafer originally conceived of Patria as a bipartite work, where the two halves would be performed simultaneously on separate stages. Instead, the two halves became Patria 1 and 2. By 1979, Schafer began to think of Patria as a cycle of six works. By 1990, the cycle settled into its current form of a dozen works.MacKenzie. 1. Parts ;Patria ‚Äî The Prologue, The Princess of the Stars : Captured by Three-Horned Enemy, the Princess sings an aria across a lake before a sunrise ritual. The audience sits on the shore while the ritual is performed on the lake in canoes. Wolf, who represents the id, leaves the lake to search for the Princess, hoping she will redeem him with her compassion. Only then can he rise to the heavens and inherit the moon. The Princess will return to the heavens as well. Wolf's search will take him through many identities and many generations. The Princess will become the human Ariadne. ;Patria 1 ‚Äî Wolfman : Wolf's first incarnation is as a refugee, who is unable to integrate into his new country. He locates Ariadne at a party, but he is unable to meet her. He stabs himself in the stomach with a knife over this heartbreak. :Patria I was premiered as a co-production of the COC and the Shaw Festival. ;Patria 2 ‚Äî Requiems for the Party Girl : The Star Princess has incarnated as Ariadne in her first transformation on Earth. She is committed in a mental asylum with no exits. The doctors are completely unable to treat her. Ariadne searches for an exit, and she is the only patient to do so. ;Patria 3 ‚Äî The Greatest Show : The music of Patria 1 and 2 is pulverized and performed at an outdoors carnival at night throughout various tents and booths. The fairgrounds are destroyed at the conclusion. ;Patria 4 ‚Äî The Black Theatre of Hermes Trismegistos : In a deserted mine or factory at midnight, Hermes Trismegistos (the thrice great) guides the work of medieval alchemists who are gathered around a crucible.

It is located at the southern slope of the Kyffh√§user mountain range, on an artificial arm of the Wipper river, a tributary of the Unstrut. Because of the nearby Kyffh√§user monument dedicated to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, it is nicknamed Barbarossastadt. The municipality includes the villages of Seehausen, Udersleben, (since 2007) Esperstedt and (since 2019) Ichstedt and Ringleben.  History  Frankenhausen was first attested as a Frankish settlement in the 9th century in deeds of the Abbey of Fulda. It received town privileges in 1282 and from 1340 on was part of the County of Schwarzburg. On 15 May 1525 it was the location of the Battle of Frankenhausen, one of the last great battles of the German Peasants' War, when the insurgent peasants under Thomas M√ºntzer were defeated by troops of the allied Duke George of Saxony, Landgrave Philip I of Hesse and Duke Henry V of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. M√ºntzer was captured, tortured and finally beheaded at M√ºhlhausen on 27 May. With the partition of Schwarzburg County in 1599, Frankenhausen became the capital of the Unterherrschaft subdivision of the County of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, which in 1710 was raised to a principality. Prince G√ºnther Victor was the last German monarch to abdicate, on 23 November (as Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt) and 25 November 1918 (as Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen). The succeeding short-lived Free State of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt merged into the newly created Thuringia in 1920. Since 1818 a saline water well that had been used for centuries to extract salt has been used for saline baths and medical purposes. Therefore, in 1927 Frankenhausen received the official title of a spa town (Bad). In the 19th century the town was also famous for the manufacture of pearl buttons. Today it mainly depends on tourism and spa vacation. Since 1972 Frankenhausen has been a garrison town, formerly of a motorised infantry regiment of the National People's Army, from 1990 on of the 13th Mechanized Infantry Division of the German Army. = Population since 1994 = Population as of 31 December unless otherwise noted:Datenquelle: Th√ºringer Landesamt f√ºr Statistik { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"20%\\"  * 1994: 9730 * 1995: 9834 * 1996: 9768 * 1997: 9661 * 1998: 9542 * 1999: 9472  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"20%\\"  * 2000: 9432 * 2001: 9233 * 2002: 9132 * 2003: 8978 * 2004: 8809 * 2005: 8775  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"20%\\"  * 2006: 8706 * 2007: 9292 * 2008: 9097 * 2009: 9000 * 2010: 8962 * 2011: 8677  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"20%\\"  * 2012: 8677 * 2013: 8672 * 2014: 8734 * 2015: 8792 } Peasants' War Panorama Frankenhausen Town hall Panorama Museum, rotunda The tower of Bad Frankenhausen's Oberkirche is claimed to be the second most crooked tower in Germany. Based on Friedrich Engels' 1850 book The Peasant War in Germany, Thomas M√ºntzer as an early revolutionary became an icon of historical materialism in East Germany. At the 450-years jubilee of the battle for Frankenhaus in 1975, the then- ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) charged the rector of the Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts, Professor Werner T√ºbke, with the creation of a monumental panorama painting: Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany, also known as the Peasants' War Panorama. The work in a specially erected rotunda was finished in 1987. Depicting more than 3000 individuals, the panorama is in length and in height. Despite the Politburo's plans modelled on the Battle of Borodino panorama at Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow, T√ºbke realised a rather pessimistic vision of a resigned M√ºntzer standing alone among battling troops, a Bundschuh flag on the ground at his side. The Panorama was inaugurated by Kurt Hager and Margot Honecker, as deputy for her husband Erich, on 14 September 1989, eight weeks before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the eventual reunification of Germany in October 1990. Today the Panorama Museum displays art shows and a collection of works of contemporary international artist. Sights * Frankenhausen Castle, with medieval foundations from the 14th century on, served as a residence of the House of Schwarzburg. Heavily damaged during the Peasants' War, it was rebuilt in Renaissance style between 1533 and 1536. Today it houses a museum of local history. * The church of Our Dear Lady at the Mountain, colloquially called Oberkirche (Upper Church), built in 1382, is known for its spire, which precariously inclines to the side. The imbalance caused by sinkholes of the nearby salt mines had already started to affect it in the 17th century, for the Baroque top partly equalises the slant of the tower. When last measured, it leant at 4.8¬∞,Christoph Seidler, \\"Built on Salt: The Leaning Tower of Bad Frankenhausen\\", Der Spiegel 29 April 2010. increasing 6 cm/2.4 ins a year, and thus is the second most leaning tower of Germany (after the spire of the Suurhusen Church) and leaning to a greater extent than the Tower of Pisa.Bojan Pancevski, Colin Freeman, Malcolm Moore, \\"Churches Challenge Leaning Tower of Pisa\\", Sunday Telegraph, 22 July 2007. In 2014, the German federal government agreed to pay ‚Ç¨950,000 for work to stabilise the lean of the tower, fitting a \\"steel corset\\", thereby saving the structure from the risk of demolition. * The Kyffh√§user mountain range north of the town is the site of the Kyffh√§user Monument, a huge sculpture in celebration of German national unity built from 1890 to 1896 to plans by Bruno Schmitz on the ruins of a former Kaiserpfalz.

The New York Times Bestselling series is published through Disney Editions and Disney Hyperion, and the first book was released on August 29, 2005. Its plot follows the adventures of five teens who, by day, are holographic hosts in the Disney Theme Parks. By night, they battle Disney villains to keep them from taking control of the parks, the Disney entertainment empire, and the world. The series' franchise also includes several other elements such as an online game and an interactive educational tour provided for school groups through Disney's Youth Education Series.  Synopsis  = Disney after Dark = Five young teens, Finn, Willa, Charlene, Maybeck, and Philby, have been selected to serve as holographic theme park guides, Disney Hosts Interactives (DHI), in Walt Disney World. Thanks to a glitch in the DHI technology the five teens are transported every night into the park as holograms while they sleep. They find themselves in the middle of a war against various Disney villains called the Overtakers, led by Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, and they must stop them from taking over the park, and the world. They are helped by an original Disney Imagineer Wayne, who tells them about a riddle called \\"The Stonecutter's Quill\\". They go to different attractions and realize that the riddle refers to the first pen that Walt Disney ever owned. Once they find the pen, Finn realizes that he can defeat Maleficent with the pen and with one click... = Disney at Dawn = Things have been relatively quiet for the past few months, until things go wrong at DHI day at Magic Kingdom. The Overtakers are back, and this time the stakes are even higher. A group of Fairlies, or Fairly Humans are a group of people who have special powers. One of these Fairlies, named Jess has gone missing. Her sister, Amanda has recruited the help of the Keepers to help her find Jess. The group searches for clues to her disappearance while also trying to keep the Overtakers at bay in Disney's Animal Kingdom, where the Overtakers have gained control of the computer servers with the intent to wreak havoc. It's a race against time when the Keepers realize that the Overtakers also control the DHI server, which means that if the hosts fall asleep they could stay asleep forever. The Keepers must find Jess and destroy the Overtakers' server, all before falling asleep. = Disney in Shadow = After Wayne, their friend, mentor, and head Imagineer, disappeared during the events at Animal Kingdom, Finn, Philby, Willa, Charlene, and Maybeck suspect the worst. The Overtakers would like nothing more than to eliminate Wayne, or worse, to use his power to their own ends. Their search takes the Keepers, plus Amanda and Jess, into Hollywood Studios and Epcot, where they must fight through puzzles, giant snakes, and deal with Maleficent and her friends while discovering new truths about themselves that lead to more than they could discover. = Power Play = For the five teens who modeled as Disney Hologram Imaging hosts, life is beginning to settle down when an intriguing video arrives to Philby's computer at school. It's a call for action: the Overtakers seem to be plotting to attempt a rescue, lead by The Evil Queen and Curella devil, of two of their leaders, both of whom the Disney Imagineers have locked away somewhere following a violent encounter in Epcot. = Shell Game = Spring Break for the Keepers means a DHI cruise from Florida through the Panama canal to Los Angeles, with stops in exotic locations including Castaway Key, Disney's private island. However, for the Keepers the vacation may not be as much of a break as they'd hoped. With an ongoing battle for Walt Disney World's engineering base back home and Overtakers aboard the ship plotting something catastrophic, the Keepers are in a battle for their lives and the lives of the guests aboard the ship. = Dark Passage = The five Kingdom Keepers and their core friends have uncovered a startling truth: Maleficent and the Overtakers are plotting a catastrophic event that could have repercussions far beyond the world of Disney. They started on the Disney Dream ship. = The Insider = The Keepers have enjoyed three years of relative quiet, but as they get ready to graduate high school, the Overtakers, and a nightmare they left buried in an ancient temple in Mexico, are rising again. This time they are headed to Disneyland, the park where it all began. The Overtakers are done playing games, and the Keepers are in more danger than ever. The only one who may be able to save the kingdom is none other than Disney's most beloved icon, but he has been missing for years and time is running out. = The Fairlies = A related spin off book that follows and delves more in depth into the world and life of a Fairlie, namely: Jess and Amanda  The Syndrome: A Kingdom Keepers Adventure  Written with Brooke Muschott (as Jess) and Elizabeth Hagenlocher (as Mattie) When Amanda travels east to Orlando on a hunch, she is met with the worst news possible. Kingdom Keeper Finn Whitman is missing. Calling on her own gift (telekinesis) her sister Jess' ability to dream the future, and their fellow Fairlie Mattie Weaver's unexplained ability to read minds through physical contact, the three gifted girls must navigate treachery, deception, and the stubborn, unwilling parents of the missing Keepers if they're going to save their friends. Unforeseen  This is an ebook novella focusing on the Fairlie sisters. It picks up after Kingdom Keepers VI: Dark Passage and leads up to Book VII: The Insider. Unforeseen opens with Jess dreaming of ‚Äúcracks‚Äù in Disneyland. As Jess and Amanda set out to find answers, she encounters an old man with secrets, a young Imagineer-in- training whose future Jess wants to see, and a treasured wonderland about to shatter. = The Return (sequel) = The author of the Kingdom Keepers series, Ridley Pearson, wrote a sequel trilogy called The Return. The theme that Pearson had wanted to explore was a fictional Imagineering school and the origins of the Overtakers, the books' villains. A suggestion came from a father and son fan for King Arthur's Carousel allowing time travel and the lead character using it to go back to Disneyland opening day. Pearson was granted access to the Disney Archives to research Disneyland opening day. Disney Lands In the first book, the Keepers are about to go off to college, while the Fairlie sisters are attending the Disney School of Imagineering. Finn is the only one who believes there is something else left to do, that Walt's pen is not where it needs to be in the past and tries to follow Wayne's final clues. When he crosses over into Disneyland, he suffers memory loss and has Walt's pen drawn on his arm. While the Keepers try to figure out what's going on, the sisters, Amanda and Jess, help them by stealing classified documents from the Disney archives in the basement of their dorm building. However, the two show signs of growing apart, as neither can fully tell the other what they know. With the help of some new friends, they find out about something called the Legacy of Secrets and a disgruntled Disney employee from sixty years ago. The Keepers finally connect the dots and figure out that the music box in Walt's apartment opens an anomaly on a horse on King Arthur Carrousel, making the person on it time travel. They find out it can be controlled and that they are needed in the past. After some trial runs, they leave as DHIs, not giving anyone a clue as to their whereabouts. Legacy of Secrets In the second book, the Keepers have successfully arrived at Disneyland's Opening Day in 1955, there to track down Walt's pen and ensure that it is in the right place in the future. Compared to earlier missions, this seems a simple task, especially with the help of their old mentor Wayne, a teen worker at the park in 1955. But they face problems: although the Overtakers do not yet exist, there is a group of regular people who want to stop them and use Walt's magic against him. In the present, the Fairlie sisters have figured out their friends' fate, and are determined to help however possible. They decide to find out more about the Legacy of Secrets, still as dangerous in the present as in 1955. Setting off on their own mission, they find out that the present Legacy is connected to the barracks in Baltimore from which they escaped, after being tested for their abilities. Putting the pieces together, they find that in the present, the Legacy is going to unleash the Fairlies on Disney and destroy it themselves, having previously put their resources behind the Overtakers. After solving a puzzle Walt created for his family to find the pen, the Keepers show down with the Legacy's head, Amery Hollingsworth, who Amanda and Jess have managed to warn them about. Hollingsworth wants to use the pen and its magical ink to create the Overtakers that the Keepers battled in the present. Walt Disney himself shows up, warned by Wayne, and has Hollingsworth and his accomplices thrown out of the park. He promises the Keepers that he will make sure the pen goes to the right place. In the present, Tia Dalma has been shown concocting a strange brew. She has apparently secretly reorganized the Overtakers, who attack in full force when the sisters and their friends (Tim Walters, Emily Fredrikson, and Nick Perkins) show up in Disneyland to receive Philby's phone, which the Imagineers can wire to Return the Keepers to the present. The sisters need the Keepers to stay in the past a little longer, to combat the Legacy and prevent the origin of the Overtakers. Tia Dalma has resurrected Maleficent, whom Finn killed in Mexico three years ago, and she is physically deformed, but more powerful than ever. A weakened Amanda climbs onto the activated carrousel and travels to 1955 to escape and to warn the Keepers, leaving Jess in the present. Jess gives the package to the Imagineers and tells them to write the information on her arms, in case Amanda's memory was affected, and start the music box for her. Disney at Last! In the third book, Amery Hollingsworth in 1955 journeys to the Louisiana swamps to hire a witch doctor (a man known as the Traveler) to help him create the Overtakers, the Disney villains. In the present, the Fairlies show up at Disneyland and begin to cause chaos. Finn and the other Keepers, now joined in the past by Amanda and Jess, have decided to make use of the fact that they cannot yet return home and stop Hollingsworth from creating the Overtakers, though they don't know his plan. Charlene and Amanda track a suspicious pair of teen \\"Cast Members\\" to a secret room in the walls of Sleeping Beauty Castle and are almost caught. Using one of Jess' dreams, they get help from Marty Sklar, who has heard stories about graveyard vandalisms outside the park that go along with Jess' dream of a graveyard and the Traveler. When they go to the graveyard, they are attacked by zombies one night; the next, they uncover the recently removed coffins and find that certain bones have been removed from the bodies. Chased by ghosts and more zombies under the Traveler's control, they flee. Mattie Weaver, Amanda and Jess' Fairlie friend, is working in the present to uncover the details of the impending Fairlie attack, which will be controlled by Amery Hollingsworth, Jr. As Joe Garlington, a head Imagineer, rallies the other Disney characters to their cause, she infiltrates a group of Fairlies hiding out backstage in the Tower of Terror. She gets made into a DHI, to more easily communicate with Imagineers when held captive. Zeke (Ezekiel or Ebsy) Hollingsworth leads a strike with Nick Perkins and select characters to free her, but she resists, deciding she will be of more use on the inside. Zeke is captured. The Keepers send Finn and Amanda to investigate another lead from Marty: a mannequin of Pinocchio in a workshop on property, which would match Jess' dream of a Pinocchio animation cel being burned. They find the mannequin shaped exactly to fit a projected cel from the movie, and then narrowly escape a fan that blows at tornado speeds. To follow up, the whole group helps break into the mannequin company that Disney ordered from, and escaping police, find that Amery Hollingsworth is also a customer. They trace the address to the old abandoned hotel where Finn went exploring and which is home to Amanda and Jess' DSI dorm in the present. Meanwhile, Hollingsworth and the Traveler break into a morgue and steal more bones. Mattie continues to unravel the Fairlies' orders. She manages to connect with them and convinces a couple of them that they are still prisoners, though they're outside Barracks 14's walls, and that they should revolt against their holders. They're not only tools, but also fallback, the Fairlies will be the ones who go to prison for ruining Disneyland, not the Barracks masters or Hollingsworth, Jr. They decide that when the signal comes on the day of the attack, it will determine whether to follow the plan or revolt. The Keepers have been staking out the hotel and the funeral home connected to the morgue investigation. Charlene and Maybeck find Legacy members unloading mannequins into the hotel, and Finn and Amanda arrive to stop them. They witness a ritual where the Traveler burns the bones and the animation cel, does some chanting, shapes a mannequin to fit a projection from the cartoon or movie, and brings it to life as an Overtaker witch in the theater of the hotel, using early Fairlies he enchanted to project emotion and knowledge into it. Willa and Jess narrowly escape death at the funeral home and Jess finds out about the bones, and she and Willa go to the hotel to help. They defeat the Traveler and Fairlies and a halfway-formed Maleficent and destroy them, but in the process Finn is crushed between two enchanted tables, sacrificing himself to kill Hollingsworth. Though the Fairlies decide to revolt, the attack proceeds anyway, with fireworks launching out of control across Disneyland in daytime. Mattie and Nick try to stop the attack, supported by Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters. The Fairlies defeat their holders and Mattie and Nick find Tia Dalma at the top of the Matterhorn, with resurrected Maleficent directing the fireworks. (It's supposed that the Traveler is actually the Devil and Tia Dalma, his offspring, is the Grim Reaper.) Using their electricity, they destroy both Maleficent and Tia Dalma. The Keepers return to the present with a dead Finn, but upon returning their memories are off. Finn comes back to life, as do Dillard and Wayne. The book ends with the Keepers tearfully saying goodbye to this era of their life.  Characters  * Finn Whitman ‚Äì One of the most important DHIs.

He lives above the firestation on Main Street. Background About 2002, Ridley Pearson and his family went to Disney World for the first time with humorist Dave Barry. Pearson indicated to Wendy Lefkon, Disney Publishing Worldwide editorial director, that he found that each attraction and ride ‚Äútells a story, with a beginning, a middle, and the end.‚Äù Lefkon responded with an offer to write a teen thriller novel in a Disney park setting. Pearson then requested full access in off hours, which Disney would not grant. Based on his writing process of hands on and site research, Pearson turned down the offer. A month later, he was granted full access during off hours. Pearson had finished the first of the series' novel in 2004 before the publication of his co-written book, Peter and the Starcatchers, with Barry. A five book series was layout by Pearson. The first book in the series, Disney after Dark, was released August 29, 2005. With Disney After Dark selling well, Hyperion wanted to expand the series to 10 novels, however Pearson felt he could only stretch out the series to 7 books. With needing to move the story to Disneyland, the story in book 5 jumps to Disney Magic cruise ship which was being reposition to California. The fourth book in the series, Power Play, came out in April 2011 and made the New York Times Bestseller Children's Series the week of April 24, 2011. With the last book, Kingdom Keepers VII: The Insider, Pearson crowdsourced some 200 out of 600 pages, with fans voting online for which direction the book would take. During the tour for the final book in the series, Pearson announced a new sequel trilogy for this fictional world, called The Return. On March 31, 2015, the first book in the trilogy follow-up series was released. Pearson was thinking of a series called Kingdom Keepers International, taking the main characters away from the parks and going international. Ridley has posted, on his website, that a new story in the series, currently titled Kingdom Kids, is set to be released in Fall of 2020.

Geography The town is situated on the Alte Oder, an old branch of the Oder River at the northwestern rim of the Oderbruch basin and the steep rise of the Barnim Plateau. It is located east of Eberswalde, and northeast of Berlin, near the border with Poland. Bad Freienwalde has an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church as well as manufacturers of furniture and machinery. The neighbouring forests and its medicinal springs make it a favorite summer resort of Berlin inhabitants. A new tower commands a fine panoramic view over the Oder valley. The municipal area comprises the following villages: Altranft, Altglietzen, Bralitz, Hohensaaten, Hohenwutzen, Neuenhagen and Schiffm√ºhle. History Bad Freienwalde Town hall Freienwalde Castle The settlement of Vrienwalde in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was first mentioned in a 1316 deed and appeared as a town in 1364. From 1618, the Freienwalde manor was directly held by the Brandenburg prince-electors (Kurf√ºrsten). A mineral spring was discovered in 1683. The alchemist Johann Kunckel brought it to the attention of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg, who, gout-ridden, arrived in Freienwalde the next year. Recorded by the physician Bernhardus Albinus in 1685, the Kurf√ºrstenquelle became the foundation of Freienwalde's rise as a spa town. Frederick William's son King Frederick I of Prussia had a first maison de plaisance erected by the architect Andreas Schl√ºter. The development was further promoted, when in 1799 the small Neoclassical Freienwalde Castle was built according to plans by David Gilly as a summer residence of Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse- Darmstadt, the widow of King Frederick William II of Prussia. Its park was redesigned by Peter Joseph Lenn√© in 1822. The industrialist and politician Walther Rathenau acquired the palace in 1909, it was nationalised after his assassination in 1922.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation in the mid-1990s under the ring name Mantaur, and later worked there as Tank. Professional wrestling career =Catch Wrestling Association (1991‚Äì1994)= In 1991, under the ring name Bruiser Mastino, Halac traveled to Germany to work for the Catch Wrestling Association. He debuted on November 11, in a losing effort against Rambo for the World Heavyweight Championship. He remained with the promotion until late 1994, when he returned to the United States to perform for the World Wrestling Federation. =World Wrestling Federation (1994-1995)= Halac wrestled his first two matches as Bruiser Mastino defeating Nikolai Volkoff on August 25 and 26, 1994, at house shows. A few months later on the January 7, 1995 episode of Superstars of Wrestling (taped on December 10, 1994), Halac debuted in the World Wrestling Federation as Mantaur, defeating Walter Slow. The Mantaur character was that of a Minotaur who charged, trampled and mooed at opponents. Soon after debuting, he acquired Jim Cornette as his manager. Mantaur then began a small winning streak, defeating a series of jobbers. He came close to beating then- Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon, but lost the match by disqualification due to interference by Jeff Jarrett, who was involved in a feud with Ramon at that time. Mantaur made his first and only pay-per-view appearance at the 1995 Royal Rumble, where he competed in the Royal Rumble match and lasted nine minutes before being eliminated by Lex Luger. Mantaur was defeated by World Champion Bret \\"The Hitman\\" Hart during a taping of Wrestling Challenge in Moline,IL on April 26, 1995. Mantaur entered the 1995 King of the Ring tournament but was pinned by Bob \\"Spark Plug\\" Holly in a qualifying match. In his final televised WWF match, he lost to Bam Bam Bigelow as part of a push to enhance the popularity of Bigelow as a babyface. Halac made his last WWF appearance as a lumberjack in a lumberjack match between Sycho Sid and Diesel at In Your House 2. =Extreme Championship Wrestling and return to CWA (1995‚Äì1996)= After leaving the WWF, Halac returned to his Bruiser Mastino ring name and joined Extreme Championship Wrestling. He debuted there on December 1, 1995, with a victory over The Dark Ninja. Eight days later, he lost to Hack Meyers at December to Dismember. A few weeks after that, he lost to 911. At Holiday Hell, Mastino defeated El Puerto Ricano in his final match for the promotion, in which he was jeered with \\"Mantaur\\" chants from the always-vocal ECW audience. Halac then briefly returned to the Catch Wrestling Association as Terminator Mastino. =Return to WWF (1996)= In April 1996, Halac returned to the WWF playing the role of Goldust's unnamed bodyguard. He appeared with Goldust at In Your House 7 in his corner for his match against the Ultimate Warrior. After Goldust lost, the bodyguard attacked Warrior but was overpowered and body slammed. =United States Wrestling Association and second return to WWF (1997)= Halac then worked in the United States Wrestling Association as Tank, a member of The Truth Commission where he wore a mask. He won the Unified World Heavyweight Championship, his first and only wrestling title, on March 15, 1997, after defeating then-champion Jerry Lawler. He lost the belt back to Lawler in a rematch seven days later. Later that spring, Tank was involved in a controversy surrounding the World Tag Team Championship. While The Interrogator and Recon (Tank's teammates in The Truth Commission) held the title, Tank substituted for The Interrogator in one match and his team lost the title to Nick Dinsmore and Flash Flanagan. The title change was declared invalid, however, as Tank was not one of the official holders of the World Tag Team Title. He returned to the WWF in June 1997 with the Truth Commission as he fought as Tank. He was on two Shotgun Saturday Night episodes for 6 tag matches until his release later that summer. =World Championship Wrestling (1997)= Halac wrestled a dark match for World Championship Wrestling's Monday Nitro, defeating Dami√°n 666 on September 22, 1997, in his only appearance for the company. =Second return to CWA and the independent circuit (1998‚Äìpresent)= Halac returned to the CWA in September 1998, again as Bruiser Mastino.He wrestled three matches for NWA Germany later that year, winning the first against Franz Schumann on September 22, losing the second to Ulf Herman September 23, and losing the third to Shumann on December 2. He also competed in the European Wrestling Promotion (EWP), defeating Christian Eckstein on November 25. Halac returned to the EWP on May 18, 2001, winning a triple threat match against Eric Schwarz and Martin Nolte. The next day, he defeated Big Tiger Steele. Halac returned to wrestling on June 3, 2005, in Germany for one night only for Riotgas Wrestling Alliance. He won a battle royal and later that night fought his cousin Cannonball Grizzly for the RWA International title which Grizzly won. On June 2009, Halac along with his cousin PN News promoted an independent tour entitled \\"Beach Brawl 09\\" with two shows at Fun Plex in Omaha, Nebraska and concluding in Hartington, Nebraska. The tour included Alex Shelley, Homicide, Matt Morgan, Lenny Lane and Chad Collyer. On the first show of the tour, Halac (as Brusier Mastino) teamed with News (as Cannonball Grizzly) as Big O Incorporated in a winning effort against Matt Morgan & Homicide. He lost to Tito Santana at Pro Wrestling Syndicate in Metuchen, New Jersey on December 7, 2012. In May 2015, as \\"The Turkish Terror\\" Madd Mustafa, he won the American Heritage Wrestling Heavyweight Championship at their inaugural event in Adel, Iowa. In September 2016, Halac returned to Germany for European Wrestling Promotion where he teamed with Thunder against PN News and Christian Eckstein in a no contest. On November 28, 2018, Mantaur was an inaugural inductee into the Omaha Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame at the PWP Live \\"Wrestlerama\\" event at The Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha. Most recently he wrestled as Mantaur at GCW's Joey Janela's Spring Break 3 Part 2 in a Clusterfuck Battle Royal which lead to a no contest in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Personal life  In July 2016, Halac was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The case was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. Halac has type 2 diabetes.

DAW Books) cover art by Jack Gaughan Entry to Elsewhen is a collection of science fiction short stories by John Brunner, published in 1972. It contains the following stories: * \\"Host Age\\" first appeared in New Worlds in 1955. * \\"Lungfish\\" first appeared in Britain in Science Fantasy in 1957. * \\"No Other Gods But Me\\" first appeared in what the acknowledgments page of this book describes as a \\"shorter and substantially different form\\" as \\"A Time To Rend\\" in Science Fantasy in 1958. The version included in Entry to Elsewhen was written in 1966 and first appears in this collection. The above attributions notwithstanding, the book's acknowledgments page notes that \\"All three stories have been completely revised by the author for the present book.\\" Host Age The first story takes place in what appears to be the relatively near future. Set in London, it deals with the appearance and spread of a mysterious new plague. The plague defies all efforts to treat it or stop its spread, showing varied symptoms in different victims and mutating rapidly. A sinister aspect soon appears when scientists making progress in fighting the plague are repeatedly sabotaged by unknown persons. Also, the plague seems to be spread by multiple typhoid Mary individuals, found unconscious on trains with large amounts of cash but no identifying information. Eventually it is discovered that the plague is being spread by human military forces who have travelled through time from several centuries in the future. The head of this group explains that the plague was developed by an aggressive alien species with the purpose of destroying humanity. The plague's effectiveness derives in part from atrophied immune systems resulting from long-term prevention of exposure to any infectious agent. Traveling to the past is a desperate measure to introduce the virus to humans with more robust immune systems in the hope that the survivors will be better able to resist the virus when the alien species creates it. Lungfish This story takes place aboard a multi-generational spaceship travelling from Earth to a planet orbiting Tau Ceti with the goal of establishing a colony. The story's action concerns the end of the journey. The trip has taken 37 years, and by now the crew is composed of two groups‚Äîthe Earthborn, the surviving members of the original crew, and the Tripborn, descendants of the original crew, who have lived their entire lives aboard the ship. On reaching the destination planet, the Tripborn refuse to leave the ship. Never having lived on a planet, they don't seem to see the appeal. Additionally the idea causes severe agoraphobia, as experienced by one Tripborn crew member who makes a landing on the planet and must be retrieved by remote control. The Earthborn crew members employ a variety of means to make the Tripborn less comfortable on the ship, such as Psychoactive Drug included in the food supply and subtle background sounds designed to cause unease. However this fails to move the Tripborn, even despite the fact that the ship will be unable to support the full crew's life for more than a few weeks more. The Tripborn also note that it's difficult to accept the Earthborn crew's rosy predictions for the future when the overall mission calls for the Earthborn to return home, leaving the Tripborn to establish the colony. Since the ship's cargo includes the necessary tools to build a city suitable for 10,000 inhabitants on the destination planet, the Earthborn crew suggests that they instead be employed in the construction of a second spaceship. The reduced crew on the original ship could be supported by the ship's systems, and the Earthborn crew would no longer need the original ship for the return voyage. The story ends before this plan has been carried out, leaving the reader to imagine whether the plan would be successful. No Other Gods But Me As with the first story, this story takes place on the near-future Earth. Colin Hooper is a man who is completing recovery from a severe mental breakdown, which significantly included hallucination. After repeated chance meetings with Vanessa Sheriff he becomes unnerved by the fact that whenever she is present, the hallucinations return. However, she sees them as well. Their meetings are repeatedly interrupted by the appearance of a man calling himself Kolok, who makes dire predictions if they should keep meeting, but offers no details of what might occur. Vanessa marries a man who is involved with an organisation calling itself Real Truth, which she describes as a cult. The \\"Real Truthers\\" beliefs include a belief in the supremacy of human thought as the primary force in the universe, and the idea that by working together they can think into existence someone who they describe as the Perfect Man. After being drawn into a meeting of Real Truth, Colin and Vanessa accidentally cross over into a parallel-universe Earth in which mental powers such as psychokinesis are practised by a number of adepts, who use these powers to enslave the rest of the population. It is explained that these abilities originated thousands of years past as the result of a mutation which the adepts carry. The leader, Telthis, is the one with the strongest mental powers, and has been using his abilities to influence events on Colin and Vanessa's Earth with the purpose of eventually invading it and ruling both Earths. It was Telthis's efforts which caused Colin's breakdown and hallucinations. Telthis also manipulated Colin and Vanessa into their apparently random meetings, because they also carry the genetic mutation of the adepts on Telthis' Earth, and he hopes that by bringing them together they will eventually have children and promote psychokinetic and other mental powers. Kolok, it turns out, is Telthis' chief opponent, who has appeared to Colin and Vanessa in the hope of preventing this. Colin and Vanessa manage with Kolok's help to escape from captivity and return to their own Earth. Shortly afterward, Telthis' invasion begins. However he discovers that his mental powers do not function outside of his own Earth. He and his soldiers are attacked by an angry mob and carried off by police.

It is surrounded by fir-clad hills and possesses numerous handsome villa residences, a Kurhaus and a sanatorium. In the immediate neighborhood is the beautiful ducal hunting seat of Reinhardsbrunn, built out of the ruins of the famous Benedictine monastery founded in 1085. On 1 December 2007, the former municipalities Ernstroda and Finsterbergen were incorporated by Friedrichroda. History Within the German Empire (1871‚Äì1918), Friedrichroda was part of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Development of first jet flying wing aircraft During the late years of World War II, Friedrichroda was the site of manufacture of the mock-up production of the double-seat, all-weather fighter version of the Horten Ho 229 V4 and V5 (Versions 4 and 5) flying wing jet aircraft.

Past and present contact between Russia and Iran have long been complicatedly multi-faceted; often wavering between collaboration and rivalry. The two nations have a long history of geographic, economic, and socio-political interaction. Mutual relations have often been turbulent, and dormant at other times. Currently Russia and Iran act as economic partners to one another, since both countries are under sanctions by much of the Western world. Vladimir Putin with Ali Khamenei during a state visit to Tehran in September 2018. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the two neighboring nations have generally enjoyed very close cordial relations. Iran and Russia are strategic allies and form an axis in the Caucasus alongside Armenia. Iran and Russia are also military allies in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and partners in Afghanistan and post-Soviet Central Asia. Due to Western economic sanctions on Iran, Russia has become a key trading partner, especially in regard to the former's excess oil reserves. Militarily, Iran is the only country in Western Asia that has been invited to join the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Russia's own international treaty organization in response to NATO. While much of the Iranian military uses Iranian-manufactured weapons and domestic hardware, Iran still purchases some weapons systems from Russia. In turn, Iran has helped Russia with its drone technology and other military technology. Iran has its embassy in Moscow and consulates in the cities of Astrakhan and Kazan. Russia has its embassy in Tehran, and consulates in Rasht and Isfahan. History of Iran‚ÄìRussia relations Painting of Shah Suleiman I and his courtiers by Aliquli Jabbadar, Isfahan, 1670. The painting was acquired by Tsar Nicholas II, and is now kept at the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts in Saint Petersburg. =Pre-Safavid era= Derbent is renowned for the Sassanid Iranian fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Contacts between Russians and Persians have a long history, extending back more than a millennium. There were known commercial exchanges as early as the 8th century AD between Persia and Russia. They were interrupted by the Mongol invasions in the 13th and 14th centuries but started up again in the 15th century with the rise of the state of Muscovy. In the 9th‚Äì11th century AD, there were repetitive military raids undertaken by the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores of what are nowadays Iran, Azerbaijan, and Dagestan as part of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus'.Logan (1992), p. 201 Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and the areas of Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. =Safavid Empire‚ÄìRussian Empire= It was not until the 16th century that formal diplomatic contacts were established between Persia and Russia, with the latter acting as an intermediary in the trade between England and Persia. Transporting goods across Russian territory meant that the English could avoid the zones under Ottoman and Portuguese control. The Muscovy Company (also known as the Russian Company) was founded in 1553 to expand the trade routes across the Caspian sea. Moscow's role as an intermediary in exchanges between Britain and Persia led Russian traders to set up business in urban centres across Persia, as far south as Kashan. The Russian victories over the Kazan Khanate in 1552 and the Astrakhan Khanate in 1556 by Tsar Ivan IV (r. 1533‚Äì84) revived trade between Iran and Russia via the Volga-Caspian route and marked the first Russian penetration of the Caucasus and the Caspian area. Though these commercial exchanges in the latter half of the 16th century were limited in scope, they nonetheless indicate that the fledgling entente between the two countries emerged as a result of opposition to the neighboring Ottoman Empire. Stepan Razin Sailing in the Caspian Sea by Vasily Surikov, 1906 Diplomatic relations between Russia and Iran date back to 1521, when the Safavid Shah Ismail I sent an emissary to visit the Czar Vasili III. As the first diplomatic contacts between the two countries was being established, Shah Ismail was also working hard with the aim of joining forces against their mutual enemy, neighboring Ottoman Turkey. On several occasions, Iran offered Russia a deal exchanging a part of its territory (for example Derbent and Baku in 1586) for its support in its wars against their Ottoman archrivals. In 1552‚Äì53, Safavid Iran and the Muscovy state in Russia exchanged ambassadors for the first time, and, starting in 1586, they established a regular diplomatic relationship. In 1650, extensive contact between the two people, culminated in the Russo-Persian War (1651‚Äì53), after which Russia had to cede its footholds in the North Caucasus to the Safavids. In the 1660s the famous Russian Cossack ataman Stenka Razin raided, and occasionally wintered at, Persia's north coast, creating diplomatic problems for the Russian Czar in his dealings with the Persian Shah. The Russian song telling the tragic semi- legendary story of Razin's relationship with a Persian princess remains popular to this day. Peace reigned for many decades between the two peoples after these conflicts, in which trade and migration of peoples flourished. The decline of the Safavid and Ottoman state saw the rise of Imperial Russia on the other hand. After the fall of Shah Sultan Husayn brought the Safavid dynasty to an end in 1722, the greatest threats facing Persia were Russian and Ottoman ambitions for territorial expansion in the Caspian region‚Äînorth- western Persia specifically. During the Safavid period, Russian and Persian power was relatively evenly balanced. Overall, the common anti-Ottoman struggle served as the main common political interest for Iran and Russia throughout the period of Safavid rule, with several attempts to conclude an anti-Ottoman military treaty. Following Shah Husayn's fall, the relationship lost its symmetry, but it was largely restored under Nader Shah. In his later years of rule, Peter the Great found himself in a strong enough position to increase Russian influence more southwards in the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, challenging both the Safavids and the Ottomans. He made the city of Astrakhan his base for his hostilities against Persia, created a shipyard, and attacked the weakened Safavids in the Russo-Persian War (1722‚Äì1723), capturing many of its territories in the Caucasus and northern mainland Iran for several years. After several years of political chaos in Persia following the fall of the Safavids, a new and powerful Persian empire was born under the highly successful military leader Nader Shah. Fearing a costly war which would most likely be lost against Nader and also being flanked by the Turks in the west, the Russians were forced to give back all territories and retreat from the entire Caucasus and northern mainland Iran as according to the Treaty of Resht (1732) and Treaty of Ganja (1735) during the reign of Anna of Russia. The terms of the treaty also included the first instance of close Russo-Iranian collaboration against a common enemy, in this case the Ottoman Turks. =Qajar Persia‚ÄìRussian Empire= Irano-Russian relations particularly picked up again following the death of Nader Shah and the dissolution of his Afsharid Dynasty which gave eventually way to the Qajarid dynasty in the mid-18th century. The first Qajar Persian Ambassador to Russia was Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi. After the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, who stabilized the nation and re-established Iranian suzerainty in the Caucasus, the Qajarid government was quickly absorbed with managing domestic turmoil, while rival colonial powers rapidly sought a stable foothold in the region. While the Portuguese, British, and Dutch competed for the south and southeast of Persia in the Persian Gulf, the Russian Empire largely was left unchallenged in the north as it plunged southward to establish dominance in Persia's northern territories. Plagued with internal politics, the Qajarid government found itself incapable of rising to the challenge of facing its northern threat from Russia. The Battle of Ganja (1804) during the Russo- Persian War (1804‚Äì1813). A weakened and bankrupted royal court, under Fath Ali Shah, was forced to sign the notoriously unfavourable Treaty of Gulistan (1813) following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813), irrevocably ceding what is modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, and large parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) was the outcome of the Russo- Persian War (1826‚Äì1828), which resulted in the loss of modern-day Armenia and the remainder of the Azerbaijan Republic, and granted Russia several highly beneficial capitulatory rights, after efforts and initial success by Abbas Mirza failed to ultimately secure Persia's northern front. By these two treaties, Iran lost swaths of its integral territories that had made part of the concept of Iran for centuries. The area to the north of the Aras River, which included the territories of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century. Anti-Russian sentiment was so high in Persia during that time that uprisings in numerous cities were formed. The famous Russian intellectual, ambassador to Persia, and Alexander Pushkin's best friend, Alexander Griboyedov, was killed along with hundreds of Cossacks by angry mobs in Tehran during these uprisings. With the Russian Empire still advancing south in the course of two wars against Persia, and the treaties of Turkmanchay and Golestan in the western frontiers, plus the unexpected death of Abbas Mirza in 1823, and the murder of Persia's Grand Vizier (Mirza AbolQasem Qa'im MaqƒÅm), Persia lost its traditional foothold in Central Asia.Nasser Takmil Homayoun. Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?. 2004. p.78. The Treaty of Akhal, in which the Qajarid's were forced to drop all claims on Central Asia and parts of Turkmenistan, topped off Persian losses to the global emerging power of Imperial Russia. Alexander II of Russia and Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in Saint Petersburg, 1873 By the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire's dominance became so pronounced that Tabriz, Qazvin, and a host of other cities were occupied by Russia, and the central government in Tehran was left with no power to even select its own ministers without the approval of the Anglo- Russian consulates. Morgan Shuster, for example, had to resign under tremendous British and Russian pressure on the royal court. Shuster's book \\"The Strangling of Persia\\"Morgan Shuster, The Strangling of Persia: Story of the European Diplomacy and Oriental Intrigue That Resulted in the Denationalization of Twelve Million Mohammedans. is an account of these times, and a harsh criticism of the Russian and British Empires. Northern Iran at this point was officially a sphere of influence of Imperial Russia, and many ethnic Russian settlements were established there. In the same period, by a proposal of the Shah with the backing of the Tsar, the Russians founded the Persian Cossack Brigade, which and would prove to be crucial in the next few decades of Iranian history and Irano-Russian relations. The Persian Cossacks were organized along Russian lines and controlled by Russian officers. They dominated Tehran and most northern centers of living. The Russians also organized a banking institution in Iran, which they established in 1890. In 1907, Russia and Britain divided Iran into three segments that served their mutual interests, in the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. The Russians gained control over the northern areas of Iran, which included the cities of Tabriz, Tehran, Mashad, and Isfahan. The British were given the southeastern region and control of the Persian Gulf, and the territory between the two regions was classified as neutral territory. These, and a series of climaxing events such as the Russian shelling of Mashad's Goharshad Mosque in 1911, and the shelling of the Persian National Assembly by the Russian Colonel V. Liakhov, led to a surge in widespread anti-Russian sentiments across the nation. Colonel V. Liakhov was notorious for shelling the National Iranian Assembly in 1911. =Pahlavi‚ÄìSoviet Union= Image from 1916 French magazine showing the \\"Russians at Isfahan\\". One result of the public outcry against the ubiquitous presence of Imperial Russia in Persia was the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan, which followed up the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Many participants of the revolution were Iranians educated in the Caucasus, direct √©migr√©s (also called Caucasian muhajirs) from the Caucasus, as well as Armenians that at the same period were busy with establishing the Dashnaktsutyun party as well as operations directed against the neighboring Ottoman Empire. The rebellion in Gilan, headed by Mirza Kuchak Khan led to an eventual confrontation between the Iranian rebels and the Russian army, but was disrupted with the October Revolution in 1917. As a result of the October Revolution, thousands of Russians fled the country, many to Persia. Many of these refugees settled in northern Persia creating their own communities of which many of their descendants still populate the country. Some notable descendants of these Russian refugees in Persia include the political activist and writer Marina Nemat and the former general and deputy chief of the Imperial Iranian Air Force Nader Jahanbani, whose mother was a White √©migr√©. Russian involvement however continued on with the establishment of the short- lived Persian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1920, supported by Azeri and Caucasian Bolshevik leaders. After the fall of this republic, in late 1921, political and economic relations were renewed. In the 1920s, trade between the Soviet Union and Persia reached again important levels. Baku played a particularly significant role as the venue for a trade fair between the USSR and the Middle East, notably Persia.Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, \\"Red Passage to Iran: The Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922‚Äì1930\\", Ab Imperio, Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79‚Äì112. In 1921, Britain and the new Bolshevik government entered into an agreement that reversed the division of Iran made in 1907. The Bolsheviks returned all the territory back to Iran, and Iran once more had secured navigation rights on the Caspian Sea. This agreement to evacuate from Iran was made in the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship (1921), but the regaining of Iranian territory did not protect the Qajar Dynasty from a sudden coup d'√©tat led by Colonel Reza Shah. In 1941, as the Second World War raged, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom launched an undeclared joint invasion of Iran, ignoring its plea of neutrality. In a revealing cable sent on July 6, 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the local Soviet commander in northern Azerbaijan was instructed as such: :\\"Begin preparatory work to form a national autonomous Azerbaijan district with broad powers within the Iranian state and simultaneously develop separatist movements in the provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Gorgan, and Khorasan\\".Decree of the CC CPSU Politburo to Mir Bagirov, CC Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, on \\"measures to Organize a Separatist Movement in Southern Azerbaijan and Other Provinces of Northern Iran\\". Translation provided by The Cold War International History Project at The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. After the end of the war, the Soviets supported two newly formed in Iran, the Azerbaijan People's Government and the Republic of Mahabad, but both collapsed in the Iran crisis of 1946. This postwar confrontation brought the United States fully into Iran's political arena and, with Cold War starting, the US quickly moved to convert Iran into an anti-communist ally. =Post 1979= The Soviet Union was the first state to recognize the Islamic Republic of Iran, in February 1979. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, however, it supplied Saddam Hussein with large amounts of conventional arms. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini deemed Islam principally incompatible with the communist ideals (such as atheism) of the Soviet Union, leaving the secular Saddam as an ally of Moscow. However, during the war, USA imposed arms embargo on Iran, and Soviet Union supplied arms to Iran via North Korea. After the war, in 1989, Iran made an arms deal with Soviet Union. With the fall of the USSR, Tehran‚ÄìMoscow relations experienced a sudden increase in diplomatic and commercial relations, and Russia soon inherited the Soviet-Iranian arms deals. By the mid-1990s, Russia had already agreed to continue work on developing Iran's nuclear program, with plans to finish constructing the nuclear reactor plant at Bushehr, which had been delayed for nearly 20 years. During the East Prigorodny conflict, and Georgian‚ÄìOssetian conflict, Iran secretly supported Ossetian separatism against Georgia, and sided with the Ossetians against Ingush and Chechens in the conflict. Current relations Iran is a CSTO candidate As tension between the United States and Iran escalates, the country is finding itself further pushed into an alliance with Russia, as well as China. Iran, like Russia, \\"views Turkey's regional ambitions and the possible spread of some form of pan-Turkic ideology with suspicion\\".Herzig Edmund, Iran and the former Soviet South, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 1995, , p.9 Russia and Iran also share a common interest in limiting the political influence of the United States in Central Asia. This common interest has led the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to extend to Iran observer status in 2005, and offer full membership in 2006. Iran's relations with the organization, which is dominated by Russia and China, represents the most extensive diplomatic ties Iran has shared since the 1979 revolution. Iran and Russia have co-founded the Gas Exporting Countries Forum along with Qatar. =Military= Unlike previous years in which Iran's air fleet was entirely Western-made, Iran's Air Force and civilian air fleet are increasingly becoming domestically and Russian built as the US and Europe continue to maintain sanctions on Iran. In 2010, Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment led the UN to pass a new resolution, number 1929 to vote for new sanctions against Iran which bans the sale of all types of heavy weaponry (including missiles) to Iran. This resulted in the cancellation of the delivery of the S-300 system to Iran: In September 2010 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree banning the delivery of S-300 missile systems, armored vehicles, warplanes, helicopters and ships to Iran.Medvedev bans sale of S-300 missiles, other weapons to Iran (Update 1) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also criticised Russia for kowtowing to the United States. As a result of the cancellation, Iran brought suit against Russia in Swiss court and in response to the lawsuit Russia threatened to withdraw diplomatic support for Iran in the nuclear dispute.Strokan, Sergey. \\"Russia and Iran: Heading toward a political earthquake?\\" RT, 15 August 2012. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Iran and Russia have become the Syrian government's principal allies in the conflict, openly providing armed support. Meanwhile, Russia's own relations with the West plummeted due to the Ukraine crisis, the 2018 Skripal poisoning incident in Great Britain, and alleged Russian interference with Western politics, prompting the U.S. and Europe to retaliate with sanctions against Russia. As a result, Russia has shown a degree willingness to ally with Iran militarily. Following the JCPOA agreement, President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban in 2015 and the deal for the S-300 missile defense system to Iran was revived.Putin Lifts Ban On Supplies Of S-300 Missiles To Iran The delivery was completed in November 2016 and was to be followed by a $10 billion deal that included helicopters, planes and artillery systems.Russia Completes S-300 Delivery to Iran =Trade= Hassan Rouhani and Putin in Tehran, 20 November 2015 In addition to their trade and cooperation in hydrocarbons, Iran and Russia have also expanded trade ties in many non-energy sectors of the economy, including a large agriculture agreement in January 2009 and a telecommunications contract in December 2008. In July 2010, Iran and Russia signed an agreement to increase their cooperation in developing their energy sectors. Features of the agreement include the establishment of a joint oil exchange, which with a combined production of up to 15 million barrels of oil per day has the potential to become a leading market globally. Gazprom and Lukoil have become increasingly involved in the development of Iranian oil and gas projects. In 2005, Russia was the seventh largest trading partner of Iran, with 5.33% of all exports to Iran originating from Russia. Trade relations between the two increased from US$1 billion in 2005 to $3.7 billion in 2008. Motor vehicles, fruits, vegetables, glass, textiles, plastics, chemicals, hand-woven carpet, stone and plaster products were among the main Iranian non-oil goods exported to Russia. Relations between Russia and Iran have increased as both countries are under U.S. sanctions and are seeking new trade partners. The two countries signed a historic US$20 billion oil for goods deal in August 2014. =Eurasian Economic Union= As Iran and Russia economic and geo-political relations have improved over the years, Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) have opted for Iran to join the EEU as well. Currently, only one EEU country, Armenia, shares a land border with Iran. Iran currently remains a key partner of the Eurasian Economic Union. Iran has expressed interest in joining the EEU. During a meeting between Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, they discussed the prospect of cooperation between the customs union and Iran. According to the Iranian Ambassador to Russia, Mehdi Sanaei, Iran is focusing on signing an agreement with the EEU in 2015 regarding mutual trade and reduction of import tariffs to central Asian countries and trading in national currencies as part of the agreement rather than in US dollars. In May 2015, the Union gave the initial go-ahead to signing a free trade agreement with Iran. Described as the EEU's \\"key partner in the Middle East\\" by Andrey Slepnev, the Russian representative on the Eurasian Economic Commission board in an expert-level EEU meeting in Yerevan, Viktor Khristenko furthermore noted that Iran is an important partner for all the EEU member states. He stated that \\"Cooperation between the EEU and Iran is an important area of our work in strengthening the economic stability of the region\\".  Polls  According to 2015 data from Pew Research Center, 54% of Russians have a negative opinion of Iran, with 34% expressing a positive opinion.Global Indicators Database. Pew Research Center. According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 86% of Russians view Iran's influence positively, with 10% expressing a negative view.2013 World Service Poll BBC A Gallup poll from the end of 2013 showed Iran ranked as sixth greatest threat to peace in the world according to Russian view (3%), after United States (54%), China (6%), Iraq (5%), and Syria (5%). According to a December 2018 survey by IranPoll, 63.8% of Iranians have a favorable view of Russia, with 34.5% expressing an unfavorable view.

Early years  Petros Elia was from the Lower Baz village, Ottoman Empire in 1880. There he received his elementary education before attending a European missionary school in the Persian city of Urmia. After finishing his studies, he went back to his village of Baz and became a teacher there. It was thanks to his fluency in numerous languages, including Syriac, Turkish, Arabic, French, Persian, Kurdish, English, and Russian, he was appointed by the Ottomans as a secretary, and as a Consul in Urmia briefly in 1909.  World War I  After the Russians entered Urmia, Agha Petros was appointed as a general with a small Assyrian force under his command. He later engaged and defeated forces of Ottoman and Kurds in a series of battles. He was later approached by the Allies and was given command of the left wing of the army of Assyrian Volunteers (the right wing being commanded by Mar Shimun‚Äôs brother David Shimunaia, the center being under the command of Mar Shimun).Joseph Naayem, Shall this Nation die?, Chaldean Rescue, New York, 1920, p. 277 online version Naayem, Shall This Nation Die?, p. 281 His volunteers had quite a few successes over the Ottoman forces, notably at Suldouze where Petros‚Äô 1,500 horsemen overcame the forces of Kheiri Bey's (8,000 men).

There was disunion in the ranks, and instead of posting a force to contain the Turks, whom he had defeated previously, he moved his forces to Sain Kala as encouraged by the British officials, who had promised him military help. Nevertheless, the British did not fulfill their promises. He reached Sain Kala seven days after the British detachment retired.The Tragedy of the Assyrians By R. S. Stafford online version After the invasion of Mosul by the Young Turks, the Assyrian army, led by General Agha Petros, fought intensively and successfully against the Ottoman army and their Kurdish allies, and pushed them out of Mosul and the whole area, leading to Britain's control of the region. The battles are described in detail by surviving letters of Petros and British officials. Agha Petros also had some disagreements with Mar Shimun, the patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, and was often mistrusted by his family.Ashur Giwargis,The Assyrian Liberation Movement And the French Intervention (1919‚Äì1922), AINA.orgJoseph Naayem, Shall this Nation die?, Chaldean Rescue, New York, 1920, p296 online version : \\"The cause of our flight was Agha Petrus who had written to Mar Shimun at Salmas, advising him to commence the attack on the Turks, who had retired on Kara Tepe, and promising that he would reinforce him with 3,500 men.

On July 24, 1923, he took part in the League of Nations Peace Conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he approached the Turkish delegation for the resettlement of the Assyrians in and around Hakk√¢ri Province in exchange for the loyalty of the Assyrians.

He was later to be found in Rome where he passed himself off as an Assyrian tribal chief desirous to bring his tribe from the Assyrian Church of the East over to the fold of the Roman Catholic Church (called ¬´ Chaldean Church ¬ª). Impressed and grateful for this decision, the Catholic authorities granted him an official decoration. Petros then returned to the Ottoman Empire and displayed his decoration from the Pope to local authorities to ask for a job at an Ottoman Consulate. A job that he did get, as a secretary, and as a Consul in Urmia in 1909. Some historians believe Petros Elia was merely concerned by his own ambition.

It lay on the trade route from the coast to Lake Tanganyika and to the kingdoms to the west of Lake Victoria. The various peoples of the region were known as long-distance traders, providing porters for caravans and arranging caravans in their own right. At first the main trade was in ivory, but later slaving became more important. Location Female torso thought to have originated in the region The Unyamwezi region lies around the modern town of Tabora, between the coast and Lake Tanganyika, and includes the Tabora, Nzega and Kahama districts of the western plateau of modern Tanzania. Unyamwezi is mentioned as early as the 16th century by the Portuguese and by Antonio Pigafetta, under the name Munemugi or \\" Land of the Moon,\\" which is the exact equivalent of the name Wu-nya-mweziby which the land is known to its own people. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition said the region \\"is rich in woods and grass, and has many villages surrounded by well cultivated farms and gardens. The western portions, however, are somewhat swampy and unhealthy.\\" In the 19th century the inhabitants were called Nyamwezi people by outsiders, although this term covered various different groups. History People of the region in 1914Unyamwezi lay at a juncture where a trade route from the coast split, with one branch going west to the port of Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika while another branch led north to the kingdoms of Buganda and Bunyoro. Coastal traders settled in Unyamwezi, some with hundreds of well-armed retainers. The Nyamwezi provided most of the porters for the caravans organized by the coastal Arabs and Swahilis, and also conducted their own caravans. The Nyamwezi were long-distance traders throughout East Africa. Ivory was not widely used by the Nyamwezi, but at some point they became aware that there was an overseas market for the product, and began to carry ivory along the route from Tabora down to the Indian Ocean coast opposite Zanzibar. There are records of Sultan Sayyid Said of Zanzibar negotiating with envoys from Unyamwezi in 1839 for safe passage for caravans to the interior. The Nyamwezi did not sell their own people as slaves, since they needed manpower for the ivory trade, but after the 1850s the slave trade began to become important. Slaves brought from the Congo Basin or the Great Lakes region would be held at Tabora, then sent down to the coast in small groups for onward shipment. The first Europeans to reach the region were Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke, who had been sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society and the British government to investigate the great Lake Uniam√©si said by German missionaries to lie in the region and determine if it was the source of the Nile. Burton and Speke reached Zanzibar on 20 December 1857, visited Johannes Rebmann (who had reported the lake) at his Kisuludini mission station, and paid a visit to Fuga, capital of the Usambare kingdom. They left for the interior on 26 June 1858. After travelling through mountainous country they reached the inner plateau of Uniamesi. At the Arab trading post of Kazeh (now Tabora) they recorded an elevation of . At Kazeh Burton and Speke found a mixed population of Nyamwezi, Tutsi and Arabs engaged in cattle farming and cultivation of foods such as rice, cassava, pawpaw and citrus. Burton called Unyamwezi the garden of inter-tropical Africa. Henry Morton Stanley visited the region in 1871, where he found that the Zanzibar Arabs were predominant in the country. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"later the natives rose and, under Mirambo‚Äîwho had been a common porter and rose to be a conquering chief, earning for himself the title of the Black Bonaparte‚Äîa Negro kingdom was formed. Since 1890 the country has been under German control and the power of the native chiefs greatly curtailed.\\" Notes References  Category:Geography of Tanzania ","title":"Unyamwezi"},{"id":"3912129","text":"The Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Revealed After the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas are selected tablets written by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and published together as of 1978. The current edition bears the title Fountain of Wisdom: A Collection of Writings from Bah√° ºu'll√°h. As his mission drew to a close after his writing of the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas in 1873, he continued to write unnumbered tablets and letters, doing so until the last days of his life in 1892. Six of the tablets in this volume were translated into English and published in 1917. The translations were improved upon by Shoghi Effendi, and those not translated by him were filled in with the publication in 1978 under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice. Law·∏•-i-Karmil (Tablet of Carmel) :See online text here The Tablet of Carmel () is a short tablet of only a few pages, but it is considered one of the charters of the Bah√° º√≠ administration. It consists essentially of a conversation between God and Mount Carmel. In it, God says to the mountain: :\\"Render thanks unto thy Lord, O Carmel. The fire of thy separation from Me was fast consuming thee... Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee the dawning-place of His signs and the dayspring of the evidences of His Revelation... Beware lest thou hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company of the most exalted angels... Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bah√° who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.\\" Shoghi Effendi described the tablet as \\"the Charter of the World Spiritual and Administrative Centers of the Faith on that mountain.\\" Implying that this document established that Mount Carmel would be the physical location of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. The two other documents described as charters by Shoghi Effendi include the Tablets of the Divine Plan, and the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Law·∏•-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Tablet) :See online text here The Law·∏•-i-Aqdas () or Most Holy Tablet, sometimes also referred to as the Tablet to the Christians, was addressed to a believer of Christian background. In the Tablet Bah√° ºu'll√°h proclaims his message to Christians across the world, and in clear terms declares that his station is that of the Kingdom of the Father that Jesus Christ had promised. BisÕüh√°r√°t (Glad-Tidings) :See online text here The BisÕüh√°r√°t () is a Tablet that is composed of fifteen headings, each designated a glad-tiding, where Bah√° ºu'll√°h provides teachings and laws. While the identity of the person that Tablet was addressed to is not known, Adib Taherzadeh states that the tone of the utterances throughout the Tablet indicate that it was addressed to humankind and not specifically to an individual. Christopher Buck and Youli A. Ioannesyan call this tablet a \\"proclamatory Kitab-i-Aqdas\\", where a selection of laws from the Aqdas and supplementary texts, relevant for all humanity, are re-revealed. The main themes are abolishments of certain laws from other religions, and secular world reforms. In 1891 the Tablet was sent to Cambridge orientalist E.G. Browne and the St. Petersburg diplomat Victor Romanovich Rosen, who published translations of it in English and Russian respectively.Buck, Christopher; Ioannesyan, Youli A. (2010). Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Bish√°r√°t (Glad-Tidings): A Proclamation to Scholars and Statesmen. Bah√° º√≠ Studies Review, 16. pages 3-28. The fifteen glad-tidings are: #The abolition of the law of holy war practised by Muslims, where Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that war of any kind is incompatible with the Bah√° º√≠ principles of love and unity. #The statement that everyone should associate with all the people of the world with a spirit of friendliness regardless of race or religion. #:\\"The second Glad- Tidings It is permitted that the peoples and kindreds of the world associate with one another with joy and radiance. O people! Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.\\" #:: (Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 28) #Advocates the adoption of a universal language (See Bah√° º√≠ Faith and auxiliary language). #Serve Monarchs that protect the oppressed. #Exhorts Bah√° º√≠s to honesty and truthfulness towards their government. #Concerns the establishment of the Lesser Peace. #Confirms that clothing and facial hair are left to the discretion of each individual. #Abolishes the practice of idleness in the name of religion, performed by people who would lead an ascetic life and go into seclusion. Bah√° ºu'll√°h instead states that every person must work for the betterment of humanity. #Abrogates the practice of the confession of sins as practiced by some Christian churches, and provides a prayer to be used by individuals to ask forgiveness directly of God. #Abolishes the law of the destruction of Books. This refers to the B√°b's advice in the Bay√°n to destroy holy books of the past. #Permits the study of arts and sciences which \\"would redound to the progress and advancement of the people.\\" This is in reference to some Muslim clergy who had forbidden the study of modern sciences. #Enjoins everyone to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, and trades and raises this occupation to the station of worship. #Writes about the duties of the Universal House of Justice and that they are charged with the affairs of all people. #States that it is not necessary to undertake long journeys to visit the resting-places of the dead. This is in reference to the practice by Muslims who believe that it is conducive to the forgiveness of sins. Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that instead the cost of this journey should be offered to the Bah√° º√≠ Fund. While Bah√° ºu'll√°h disapproves of special long journeys to visit the graves of the dead, he states that there is some spiritual value in praying at the resting-place of the dead. #Recommends a constitutional monarchy combined with representative democracy in preference to a republic. ·π¨ar√°z√°t (Ornaments) :See online text here In the ·π¨ar√°z√°t () Bah√° ºu'll√°h reveals some of his teachings and exhortations. The Tablet is composed of six headings, each designating an ornament representing the characteristics that each person should obtain. Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes that truthfulness and sincerity are lacking in the world, and that corruption has spread. He also describes newspapers as the \\"mirror of the world\\" and delineates guidelines for the editorial staff. The ornaments are: #That everyone should know oneself understand what characters leads to glory or poverty, and after he has understood this he should be active in a profession or craft that serves humankind. Bah√° ºu'll√°h singles out people who dedicate themselves to the education of others. #That everyone should consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. #That everyone should strive to obtain a good character, especially justice and fairness. #States that trustworthiness is the greatest character that leads to the security of the world. #That people should not defile their tongues with the abuse of others. #States that knowledge is a wondrous gift from God, and that everyone should try to acquire it. Near the end of the Tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes to the B√°b√≠s who didn't accept his claim as He whom God shall make manifest and who instead followed Mirza Yahya, and tells them not to follow the promptings of their own selves and passions; he admonishes them lovingly to return to the path of God. Tajall√≠y√°t (Effulgences) :See online text here and this online study outline.'' 'Revelation writing': The first draft of a page from the Tajall√≠y√°t of Bah√° ºu'll√°h The Tajall√≠y√°t () was revealed circa 1885 while Bah√° ºu'll√°h was in Bahj√≠ in honour of Ust√°d  ªAl√≠-Akbar, who was one of the believers from the city of Yazd, and who designed the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Ishq√°b√°d. The first couple pages of the tablet are written in Arabic, and the remainder in Persian. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h explains the station of the Manifestation of God, and specifically his own mission. He states that he has ushered in the Day of God, and that no one can recognize God except through him. The tablet is written as four tajall√≠s, or effulgences, which are: # The knowledge of God can only be obtained through the Manifestation of God. # Steadfastness in the cause of God is obtained by recognizing the Manifestation of God, and through faith in his wisdom and teachings. # It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire knowledge in the arts, crafts, and sciences, but only those that can help humanity advance, and \\"not those which begin with words and end with words.\\" # Recognition of the divinity of the Manifestations of God. Kalim√°t-i-Firdaws√≠yyih (Words of Paradise) :See online text here The Kalim√°t-i-Firdaws√≠yyih () was revealed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h two years before his death in honour of his trusted disciple ·∏§√°j√≠ M√≠rz√° ·∏§aydar- ªAl√≠. The tablet is partly written in a style where the words of God are written on ten leaves. Among other things, Bah√° ºu'll√°h states that people will be exalted through \\"honesty, virtue, wisdom and saintly character,\\" and that the fear of God is a safe stronghold for all the peoples of the world. He states that living in seclusion or practising asceticism is not acceptable, and that instead all should work towards the betterment of humanity rather than that what profits themselves; he extols the praiseworthiness of charity and the use of sciences and arts to promote the well-being of humankind. He furthermore writes that moderation is desirable in all matters, and that anything taken to an excess is a source of evil. He also writes regarding the importance of the moral education of children. Furthermore, Bah√° ºu'll√°h restates the Golden Rule: :\\"O son of man! If thine eyes be turned towards mercy, forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto that which will profit mankind. And if thine eyes be turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbour that which thou choosest for thyself.\\" :: (Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Tablets of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 64) He further enjoins the kings and rulers of the world to uphold the cause of religion, and enjoins all the nations to cleave tenaciously to unity, which will lead to the well-being of humankind. He further writes about the use of an international auxiliary language to increase the unity of the world. He states that the basis of world order is established on the twin principles of reward and punishment, and that justice is the chief instrument for promoting unity and fellowship among people. Regarding the Universal House of Justice, he authorizes its members \\"to take counsel together regarding those things which have not been outwardly revealed in the Book\\" referring to its legislative authority and infallibility in those matters. He commands the members of the Universal House of Justice \\"to ensure the protection and safeguarding of men, women and children.\\" Law·∏•-i-Duny√° (Tablet of the World) :See online text here The Law·∏•-i-Duny√° () was revealed in Haifa by Bah√° ºu'll√°h in 1891 in honour of √Åq√° M√≠rz√° Aqay-i- Afn√°n, whose mother was the sister of the wife of the B√°b. The tablet was handed to √Åq√° M√≠rz√° Aqay-i-Afn√°n's son by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In the opening of the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h bestows his bounties upon Hands of the Cause  ªAl√≠-Akbar and Trustee of Huq√∫qu'll√°h, Am√≠n who were imprisoned in Qazvin. Bah√° ºu'll√°h then reiterates many of the teachings he had revealed in previous tablets, such as being detached from worldly desires, living a virtuous life, forbidding contention and conflict, and observing courtesy among other things. Bah√° ºu'll√°h then promulgates some of his teachings which were aimed for the unity of a world society, such as the establishment of an international language, the promotion of fellowship among all peoples, the education of children, the importance of agriculture, and the establishment of a constitutional government. IsÕühr√°q√°t (Splendours) :See online text here The  ºIsÕühr√°q√°t () was written by Bah√° ºu'll√°h circa 1885 while he was in Bahj√≠ to Jal√≠l-i-KÕühu'√≠, a coppersmith and a believer from Azerbaijan in response to questions that Jal√≠l-i-KÕühu'√≠ asked of him. The tablet starts in Arabic and continues in Persian. The title Ishr√°q√°t, which translates in English to \\"effulgences,\\" \\"radiant lights,\\" or \\"splendours,\\" refers to the splendours of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Revelation. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, in the tablet, first calls the B√°b√≠s to accept Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim to be \\"He whom God shall make manifest,\\" a figure who was foretold by the B√°b. He then elucidates on the principle of the infallibility of the Manifestations of God, and discusses the response of humanity to new Manifestations of God when they appear and why humanity, in general, does not accept the new Manifestation of God. Bah√° ºu'll√°h then discusses various prophecies of previous religions which he claims are fulfilled by his coming. He goes on to discuss the personal virtues and behaviours, mainly justice and trustworthiness, that all Manifestations of God have enjoined. He then list the nine splendours of his revelation: #Those in power must have a profound regard for religion, for it is the means of all human prosperity and progress. #The Lesser Peace is necessary to humankind's tranquillity and advancement. #Everyone must obey God's commandments. #Humankind must exhibit upright character and perform deeds of service. #Governments must rule with justice and equity. #There must be an international auxiliary language that will bind all mankind together. #Education is of paramount importance. #The Universal House of Justice is given responsibilities for the well-being of humankind and are given legislative authority to make new and authoritative laws that are not specified in his writings. #The purpose of religion is to establish unity and concord among humankind. Humankind must follow the teachings God has sent. Bah√° ºu'll√°h explicitly makes the eighth Ishr√°q an addendum to the Kit√°b-i- Aqdas. He also foresees Jal√≠l-i-KÕühu'√≠'s defection from the covenant, which occurred after the passing of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. :See also: this online study outline of Ishr√°q√°t. Law·∏•-i-·∏§ikmat (Tablet of Wisdom) :See online text here The Tablet of Wisdom () was addressed to √Åq√° Mu·∏•ammad, a distinguished believer from the town of Q√°'in, who was surnamed Nab√≠l-i-Akbar. In the abjad notation the name 'Mu·∏•ammad' has the same numerical value as 'Nab√≠l'. Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote the Tablet during his latter years in Akk√° and in the Tablet provides counsel regarding individual conduct, expounds the basic beliefs of some of the philosophers of ancient Greece, and writes about the fundamentals of true philosophy. The philosophers mentioned include the following: *Empedocles *Pythagoras *Hippocrates *Socrates *Plato *Aristotle *B√°linus (Apollonius of Tyana) :See also: this online study outline to Law·∏•-i-·∏§ikmat. A·π£l-i-Kullu'l-KÕühayr (Words of Wisdom) :See online text here The Words of Wisdom () is a relatively short tablet of only three pages. Research has indicated that it was actually revealed before the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, but it is, at least for now, being kept in the publication. Through a series of short aphorisms, it describes the essence of wisdom, love, religion and detachment. One of the quotes from this Tablet, \\"The source of all learning is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory\\" was chosen by Shoghi Effendi to adorn one of the doors on the House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. Law·∏•-i- Maq·π£√∫d (Tablet of Maq·π£√∫d) :See online text here Out of respect, the Bah√° º√≠s, rather than addressing Bah√° ºu'll√°h directly, would write to his amanuensis, M√≠rz√° √Åq√° J√°n. The reply would be in the form of a letter from M√≠rz√° √Åq√° J√°n quoting words of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, but would, in fact, be dictated in its entirety by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Thus all parts of the tablet, even those which ostensibly are the words of M√≠rz√° √Åq√° J√°n himself, are sacred scripture by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The Tablet of Maq·π£√∫d () is in this form. It was addressed to M√≠rz√° Maq·π£√∫d, one of the early believers living at that time in Damascus and Jerusalem. S√∫riy-i- Vaf√° (Tablet of Vaf√°) :See online text here The S√∫riy-i-Vaf√° () was written to SÕühaykÕüh Mu·∏•ammad ·∏§usayn, one of the early believers of Shiraz, surnamed Vaf√° (Fidelity) by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The tablet was written while Bah√° ºu'll√°h was in Akk√°, and was in response to some of the questions of SÕühaykÕüh Mu·∏•ammad ·∏§usayn. In the tablet, Bah√° ºu'll√°h refers to the immensity and boundlessness of the spiritual worlds. Law·∏•-i-Siyyid-i-Mihd√≠y-i-Dahaj√≠ (Tablet to Siyyid Mihd√≠y-i-Dahaj√≠) :See online text here In the Tablet to Siyyid Mihd√≠y-i- Dahaj√≠ (), Bah√° ºu'll√°h writes to Siyyid Mihd√≠y-i-Dahaj√≠ who later broke the Covenant. Bah√° ºu'll√°h stresses the importance of serving the Bah√° º√≠ cause, and of teaching the Faith to others. He explains the power of a pure and stainless heart in influencing one's words to influence people, and asks that people memorize passages from the Holy Writings to use in the course of their speech. He also cautions against causing division and discord between people. Law·∏•- i-Burh√°n (Tablet of the Proof) King of Martyrs (left), and Beloved of Martyrs (right) :See online text here The Tablet of the Proof () was written after the martyrdom of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, and was addressed to SÕühaykÕüh Mu·∏•ammad B√°qir, denounced by Bah√° ºu'll√°h as the 'Wolf'. In this tablet Bah√° ºu'll√°h refers to M√≠r Mu·∏•ammad ·∏§usayn, the Im√°m Jum'ih of Isfah√°n, surnamed the 'She-Serpent', who was SÕühaykÕüh Mu·∏•ammad B√°qir's accomplice in the persecution of the Bah√° º√≠s. The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf was addressed to the son of SÕühaykÕüh Mu·∏•ammad B√°qir. Kit√°b-i- ªAhd (Book of the Covenant) The Kit√°b-i- ªAhd ( literally \\"Book of My Covenant\\") is Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Will and Testament, where he selects  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as his successor. While the Tablet of the Branch, composed in the Adrianople period had clearly signaled a high station for \\"the Branch of Holiness\\" and the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas has specified that this high station involved leadership of the Bah√° º√≠ community after Bah√° ºu'll√°h's passing, it was only with the unsealing of the Kit√°b-i- ªAhd after the passing of Bah√° ºu'll√°h that it was confirmed that the Branch referred to was indeed  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°.

It is situated on both sides of the river Bode, approximately northeast of Aschersleben, and south of Magdeburg. Pop. (2005) 23,538. It was one of the chief seats of the German salt-producing industry. It is still surrounded in part by the ruins of its ancient walls, but, with the exception of the parish church of St. John (15th century), there are no buildings worthy of special notice. History The first mention of the place was in connection with the village of Alt-Sta√üfurt in 806, in an invitation by Emperor Charlemagne to the Abbot Fulrad of St. Quentin to hold an army meeting at Starasfurt on the Bode River. The interpretation of the name is most likely from a composition of the Old Slavic word for old (staraja) with the Old High German word for river-crossing (furt). The importance of Sta√üfurt in the Middle Ages was due to its location. Here, the old trading and salt road led from L√ºneburg coming to Halle. The village Alt-Sta√üfurt north of the Bode was temporally and spiritually under the Archbishop of Magdeburg. In the 11th century, a castle was built south of the Bode. By 1180, the city law was extended to settlement areas south of the Bode within the defensive walls. Until 1277, Sta√üfurt and its castle was in the possession of the Anhalt Counts. Afterward, the brother Dukes of Saxony, John I and Albrecht II, held such a huge banquet celebrating their knighthoods that they to settle the debt of 6,000 silver marks by pledging Sta√üfurt to Archbishop Conrad II of Magdeburg on 8 July 1276. In the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, Sta√üfurt shared the fate of Magdeburg and was awarded to Brandenburg, but only on the death of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, who had been promised the territory in the Peace of Prague in 1635. As of 1680, Sta√üfurt was a so-called Immediate City directly subordinated to the Duchy of Magdeburg and lay until 1807 in the Holzkreis region. After this, it was temporarily within a canton of the Kingdom of Westphalia. From 1815, Sta√üfurt was incorporated into the administrative district of Magdeburg in the Province of Saxony, and remained so until the dissolution of the Prussian state in 1947. During the Second World War, a small satellite camp of Buchenwald called Sta√üfurt I / Neusta√üfurt (alias deer) was built on 13 September 1944, situated between the villages of L√∂derburg-Lust and Atzendorf in which 459 prisoners, mostly from France, at the underground relocation of Ernst Heinkel AG had to work together with Polish concentration camp prisoners in extremely poor conditions. Of those, between 300 and 380 lost their lives. Another external camp existed from December 28, 1944 in the village of Leopoldshall. Both camps were evacuated on April 11, 1945 with a death march. The atomic bomb Little Boy, detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, contained 64 kilograms of uranium. At least part of the uranium allegedly came from the approximately 1,100 tons of uranium ore and uranium oxide, which had been secured by U.S. forces in Sta√üfurt in the second half of April 1945. From 1952 to 1994, Sta√üfurt was county seat of the district of Sta√üfurt and later government district Magdeburg. With the regional reform in 1994, the new county of Aschersleben- Sta√üfurt was formed by the merger of the districts Aschersleben and Sta√üfurt. In the course of the district reform in 2007, Sta√üfurt was transferred to the newly formed Salzlandkreis. The militant group SWAPO sent children from war- torn areas of South West Africa to Sta√üfurt for education and training in the German Democratic Republic during the independence struggle in the 1980s. Thus, at the beginning of 1990, 291 such children were at the school of friendship in Sta√üfurt. In August 1990, they were returned to the now independent Namibia.See the German wikipedia page at https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta%C3%9Ffurt Local divisions Sta√üfurt is divided into the following localities (with postal codes): * 20px Altsta√üfurt (39418) * 20px Atzendorf (39443) * 20px Athensleben (39446) * 20px Brumby (39443) * 20px F√∂rderstedt (39443) * 20px Gl√∂the (39443) * 20px Hohenerxleben (39443) * 20px Leopoldshall (39418) * 20px L√∂bnitz (39443) * 20px L√∂derburg (39446) * 20px Lust (39446) * 20px Neu Sta√üfurt (39418) * 20px Neundorf (39418) * 20px Rathmannsdorf (39418) * 20px Rothenf√∂rde (39446) * 20px Sta√üfurt (Altstadt) (39418) * 20px Sta√üfurt-Nord (39418) * 20px √úllnitz (39443) =The lost hamlets of Atzendorf= Around the village of Atzendorf are several lost hamlets, reputedly destroyed together with Atzendorf and many other villages of Sta√üfurt on 29 August 1635 by Imperialist troops. _Atzendorfer Jahrtausendtuch_ , Carsted Club e.V. - Heimatverein Atzendorf, Nov. 2002 Although the ruined hamlets of Eikendorfer Kock, Eimecke, K√∂tlingen, Luxdorf, and Stieritz appeared on older maps, today there is only tilled farmland. The old road to the nearby town of Borne bei Sta√üfurt was demolished but traces of its route are still visible in the lay of the land. Salt production Although saline springs are mentioned here as early as the 13th century, the first attempt to bore for salt was not made until 1839, while the systematic exploitation of the salt-beds, to which the town is indebted for its prosperity, dates only from 1856. The shafts reached deposits of salt at a depth of 850 ft. (190 m); but the finer and purer layers lie more than 100 ft. (31 m) below the surface. The rock-salt is excavated by blasting. Besides the rock-salt, the deposits of Stassfurt yield a considerable quantity of deliquescent salts and other saline products, which have encouraged the foundation of numerous chemical factories in the town and in the neighboring village of Leopoldshall (currently part of Sta√üfurt). The rock-salt works are mainly government property, while the chemical factories are in private hands. The town is also home to Sta√üfurt Museum shed, which houses many preserved steam locomotives. Stassfurt potash deposit Halite crystal from the Sta√üfurt potash deposit. The beautiful azure-blue color banding is sought after by mineral collectors. The Sta√üfurt potash deposit, a part of the same evaporite sequence that hosts the salt mines, is notable historically as the site of the earliest large-scale mining of potash for fertilizer, beginning in 1861.Vaclav Smil, 2006, Transforming the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations and Their Consequences, , Oxford University Press, Notable residents Wilhelm von Willisen in 1847 * Karl Wilhelm von Willisen (1790‚Äì1879), Prussian general * Hermann Volrath Hilprecht (born 1859 in the district of Hohenerxleben), archaeologist and assyriologist * Wilhelm Steinkopf (1879‚Äì1949), German chemist * Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk (1887‚Äì1977), Minister of Finance of Germany from 1932 to 1945 and Leading Minister of the German Reich (Chancellor) in May 1945 * Andreas Wecker (1970‚Äì), German gymnast * Eberhard K√∂llner (1939‚Äì), Backup for Sigmund J√§hn, research cosmonaut of the GDR * Waltraud Dietsch, born in Birnbaum, Germany (1950-), athlete References Category:Salzlandkreis Category:Province of Saxony Category:Bezirk Magdeburg ","title":"Sta√üfurt"},{"id":"3912164","text":"Rossosh () is a town and the administrative center of Rossoshansky District in Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

Though primarily shown as a benign spirit, she is also shown to lure promiscuous men to their death. She appears as either a beautiful young woman or deer. The Deer Woman has equivalents in Greek Mythology and other mythologies across the world. In Native American folklore Deer Woman stories are found in many Native American tribes, told to young children or by young adults and prepubescents in tribes like the Sioux, Ojibwe, Ponca, the Omaha people, Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Choctaw, the Otoe tribe, Osage, the Pawnee people, and the Iroquois - and those are only the few that have documented Deer Woman sightings. In Ojibwe tradition, she can be banished through the use of chanting and tobacco. Others claim that the spell she casts can be broken if one looks at her cloven hooves. Other stories and traditions describe the sighting of Deer Woman as a sign of personal transformation or as a warning. Deer Woman is also said to be fond of dancing and will sometimes join a communal dance unnoticed, leaving only when the drum beating ceases.LaDuke, Winona Last Standing Woman Page 243 Published by Voyageur Press, 1997 Accessed via google Book October 12, 2008Where the White Stag Runs: Boundary and Transformation in Deer Myths, Legends, and Songs by Ari Berk Realms of Fantasy magazine, 2003 Similar creatures The Deer Women show characteristics and traits of both sirens and succubi. The siren, according to the Theoi Project, are monstrous sea nymphs that lure men to their deaths with their song. Succubi, as defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, are \\"demons who take female form who have sexual intercourse with men in their sleep\\"; constant contact with a succubus can result in failing health or death for the man. Deer woman lure men with their beauty and magic, like the sirens, and then sleep with and kill men like succubi. Countless female spirits world wide have similar characteristics. Fiura, of the Chilo√© region of Chile, causes deformation in anyone who looks upon her and will cast spells to confuse young woodsmen into sleeping with her. La Patasola, literally \\"one footed\\", is a shape-shifter from the Antioquia region of Colombia who takes the form of a beautiful woman to lure men with her cries of fear; when the men (who are often causing harm in one way or another to the rain forest) come to her, she drops her beautiful mask and slaughters them in an effort to protect the forest. La Tunda, another nature spirit from Colombia, lures people of all walks of life to them with their song and then drains them of blood; La Tunda can also shape-shift, but she will always have a single leg of a molinillo that she is very careful to hide. The Brazilian Iara are beautiful warrior mermaids who - when found by a man - will charm him with her voice and beauty and either drown him or turn him into something like her and make him her lover. La Llorona (\\"the crier\\"), who is found in Mexico and the Southwest United States, is a female ghost who will kidnap the souls of children - effectively killing them - and who's cries bring irrevocable sorrow and who the sighting of spells death for someone within the week. While all these spirits will lure away and/or hurt others, they also have physical deformity in common. The Deer Woman has hooves. Sirens are bird from the chest down. Succubi were originally portrayed as hideous and demonic.

History and design The locomotives were developed by SNCF for shunting duties. Initial construction was by Locotracteurs Gaston Moyse until that company ceased business, then by Fauvet Girel. Y 8000 machines were used to replace older shunting engines, as well as trip work on minor lines. The locomotives were 2 axle machines with both axles powered by a Poyaud (SSCM) diesel engine via a Voith hydraulic transmission. Locomotives were later re- engined (1997) with lower emission RVI engines; when re-engined locomotives received the green SNCF Fret livery. The locomotives also are certified for use in Italy, limited to shunting work: Y 8120 has been operated by SNCF subsidiary CapTrain Italia. After 1989 production shifted to a mechanically identical Y 8400 type, which incorporated a radio control system for shunting.

It was inspired by the Howard Hawks film The Big Sleep‚Äîin turn based on the novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler‚Äîand unofficially based on the novel The Jugger, by Richard Stark (an alias of Donald E. Westlake). Because neither Godard nor the producer paid the book's adaptation rights and following legal action by Westlake, the film was long unavailable in the United States. The film had its U.S. premiere on April 1, 2009 (three months after Westlake's death) at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco in a newly restored print distributed by Rialto Pictures.Made in U.S.A. from Rialto Pictures Criterion released the film on DVD in July 2009.Made in U.S.A from The Criterion Collection Premise Paula Nelson goes to Atlantic-Cit√© to meet her lover, Richard Politzer, at an unknown point in the future (possibly 1969). Once there, she learns that Richard is dead and decides to investigate. In her hotel room she meets Typhus, whom she ends up knocking out. His corpse is later found in the apartment of writer David Goodis. Paula is arrested and interrogated. From then on, she encounters many gangsters.

Godard did it to help his friend and producer, Georges de Beauregard, through difficulties after the censorship of The Nun, a film by Jacques Rivette, that he produced. This is the last full- length film in which Anna Karina and Jean-Luc Godard collaborated. He again directed her in a segment (called \\"Anticipation, ou: l'amour en l'an 2000\\" (Anticipation: or Love in the Year 2000)) of the film Le plus vieux m√©tier du monde (1967). Marianne Faithfull has a cameo in a cafe scene where she sings \\"As Tears Go By\\". Characters in the film are named for such real-life personages as Don Siegel, Kenji Mizoguchi, Richard Widmark, Robert McNamara, David Goodis, and Richard Nixon. Paula Nelson is probably named for Baby Face Nelson, about whom Siegel had made a film starring Mickey Rooney. The film is dedicated to \\"Nick and Sam\\", referring to Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller, \\"Hollywood mavericks who were objects of filial awe and Oedipal aggression\\" for Godard.  Reception  Made in U.S.A \\"has rarely been seen in the U.S.A.\\"; it was shown at the 1967 New York Film Festival, prompting The New York Times to call it an \\"often bewildering potpourri of film narration, imagery and message\\" and point out that \\"Anna Karina, as the questing girl friend, supplies not only a luminous beauty but also a unifying thread of humanity.\\" Over forty years later, A.O. Scott saw it at Film Forum and said while it is \\"far from a lost masterpiece, it is nonetheless a bright and jagged piece of the jigsaw puzzle of Mr. Godard‚Äôs career\\"; he suggested a number of \\"reasons for non-Godardians\\" to see the film: > There is, for one thing, a pouting and lovely Marianne Faithfull singing an > a capella version of 'As Tears Go By.'

Geography The town in the historic Lower Silesia region is situated north of the Central Sudetes mountains, approximately north-west of Wa≈Çbrzych and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. Szczawno-Zdr√≥j borders the city of Wa≈Çbrzych rin the east and the town of Bogusz√≥w-Gorce in the south. As of 2019, the town has a population of 5,608. History The area was settled in the course of the clearing of the former Silesian Przesieka borderland. A place called Salzborn was first mentioned in a 1221 deed, from the 14th century two settlements, Nieder (\\"Lower\\") and Ober (\\"Upper\\") Salzbrunn are documented. The parish church and a hospital at Nieder Salzbrunn were probably established by the Piast duke Henry I the Bearded after 1200, benefitting from the healing spring at Ober Salzbrunn first mentioned in 1385. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, it was part of the Duchy of Silesia and later the Duchy of Jawor. Together with the Silesian Duchy of Jawor-≈öwidnica it fell to the Bohemian Crown after the death of Duke Bolko II the Small in 1368, held by his widow Agnes of Habsburg until 1392. Ruled by Bohemian governors residing at KsiƒÖ≈º Castle, the area was devastated during the Thirty Years' War. It was annexed by the Prussian king Frederick the Great after the First Silesian War in 1742. In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Battle of Struga took place nearby, in which the Poles defeated a much larger Prussian army. The Zdrojowy Theater hosts the annual International Wieniawski Festival Since the 19th century the spa was very popular among the Polish cultural elite. Among its guests were poets Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, Teofil Lenartowicz, Lucjan Siemie≈Ñski and Narcyza ≈ªmichowska, composer and virtuoso violinist Karol Lipi≈Ñski, philosopher August Cieszkowski and the inventor of Esperanto L. L. Zamenhof. In 1855 and 1857, one of the greatest Polish violinists Henryk Wieniawski visited the spa and played concerts here. From 1966, the city hosts the annual International Wieniawski Festival. Among famous guests of other nationalities were King Constantine I of Greece and British politician Winston Churchill. In 1896 a new Spa Theater was built, after World War II named after Henryk Wieniawski. In 1935 Ober Salzbrunn was officially acknowledged as a spa town and renamed Bad Salzbrunn. At the end of World War II, the town was occupied by Red Army forces in the course of the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive. It became part of the Republic of Poland after the territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union in the Potsdam Agreement. In 1945 Szczawno-Zdr√≥j was granted town rights.

Ruhrort has the largest river harbour in the World, with quays extending nearly 40 kilometres along the river, and it is the principal inland shipping port in Germany. History Ruhrort south harbor in 1905 Ruhrort was founded in 1371 as a customs site and was granted town status in 1551. Due to its convenient position on the junction of two important waterways a shipping guild and a harbour had been created by 1665, mainly for trading coal from the Ruhr Valley mines. The harbour was in steady competition with the harbour of Duisburg which was located only 3 kilometers to the south. In 1701 the town fell to Prussia and the government, who had taken over the control over the harbour by 1766, gradually expanded the docks and basins. When the K√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn built its railway via the nearby towns of Duisburg and Oberhausen it connected Ruhrort to their network in 1848 and constructed the so-called \\"Eisenbahnhafen\\" (railway harbour) in order to convey their trains to the areas west of the Rhine by train ferries. During the 1860s the vast north and south basins (\\"Nordhafen\\" and \\"S√ºdhafen\\") were built. These ideal transport links led to the foundation of a steel mill to the north-east of the railway station. Although many new workers were needed for the new facilities Ruhrort did not grow very much. This was due to the town being surrounded by water on 3 sides with expansion towards the north-east blocked by the railway and the new industries. Therefore, the population remained almost constantly between 8000 and 10000 during these years. The beginning of the 20th century saw the neighbouring village of Beeck incorporated into Ruhrort, and barely two years later in 1905 the city of Duisburg was established, absorbing Ruhrort along with the towns of Meiderich, Marxloh and Hamborn, having a joint population of approximately 200,000. After the merger of the towns it was decided that the harbour of Ruhrort should be expanded further to join a new canal from Duisburg to Herne and on to Dortmund and the North Sea. In 1908 the basins A, B and C had been completed east of the existing harbour and a large railway yard was built to the north. The harbour had reached the size it retains until today. Being an important transport link Ruhrort was heavily bombed during World War II. In the 21st century, Ruhrort became a major destination of container trains from China. According to a 2018 report, it is either the destination, or one of the destinations, of some 80% of all direct China- Western Europe cargo trains.Germany‚Äôs China City: how Duisburg became Xi Jinping‚Äôs gateway to Europe: Some 80 per cent of trains from China make the world‚Äôs largest inland port their first European stop, by PHILIP OLTERMANN, 9 AUG 2018 Demographics Today Ruhrort has 5,467 inhabitants (as of Sep. 1st, 2004), 806 of which are of foreign origin, mainly from Southern Europe and the Middle East. Public transport Old towers of the Friedrich Ebert Bridge across the Rhine Public Transport in Ruhrort is provided by the \\"Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft\\" (\\"DVG\\") which operates one tram line (Line 901) and several bus lines that connect to other parts of the city. Duisburg-Ruhrort station, which lies north of central Ruhrort has been downgraded and is currently only served by a commuter line to Oberhausen operated by the private company \\"Prignitzer Eisenbahn\\". Economy * The major employer in Ruhrort still is the port and the companies operating there. Around 17,000 people work directly or indirectly in the logistics industry. * Although the furnaces of the steel mill have long been demolished, Mittal Steel still operates an oxygen steel plant in Ruhrort. * The Haniel trading company has its headquarters in Ruhrort. Sights Ruhrort is home to the German Inland Waterways Museum (Museum der deutschen Binnenschifffahrt) which is housed in the old swimming pool building. Visitors can also board one of the tour vessels for a view behind the scenes of the harbour. A walk on the promenade facing the Rhine and the quays is quite popular among tourists as well as locals. Ruhrort nowadays lacks the grimy air of a port district and is a neat little village with narrow streets, small parks and some fine cafes.

It lies high on the west slopes of the Vosges, northwest of Strasbourg by rail. In 1911, it contained an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church, a synagogue and a teachers' seminary. Its industries then included the manufacture of gloves, straw hats and liqueurs, and quarrying.  History  The area of the city of Phalsbourg, originally Pfalzburg, was originally part of the principality of L√ºtzelstein, under the overlordship of Luxembourg, then the bishops of Metz and of Strasbourg, before coming under the Dukes of Pfalz- Veldenz, all within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. In 1570, Duke Georg Johann I of Pfalz-Veldenz founded the town of Pfalzburg as a refuge for Reformed Protestants kicked out of the Duchy of Lorraine, and as an administrative center of his holdings. But the cost forced him to sell the city and the surrounding district of Einarzhausen between 1583 and 1590 to Lorraine, whose territory surrounded most of the area. In 1608, his successor Georg Gustav of Pfalz-Veldenz founded nearby Lixheim for Reformed refugees, but was also forced to sell the new town in 1623 to Lorraine. From 1629 to 1660, Pfalzburg and Lixheim were combined as the Principality of Pfalzburg, for duchess Henriette of Lorraine (1605-1660) and her three successive husbands. The principality was acknowledged by Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II in 1629. After the death of Henriette, the principality returned to Lorraine. But the next year, Lorraine had to cede it to France in the Treaty of Vincennes in 1661, at a time when most of Lorraine was occupied by French troops since 1634. The famous French military engineer Vauban reconstructed the town's fortifications in 1680. The town was of military importance as commanding one of the passes of the Vosges. The fortifications of Phalsbourg resisted the Allies in 1814 and 1815, and the Germans for four months under the commander Taillant in 1870, but they were taken on 12 December of that year, and have since been razed. The town was German again from 1871 to 1918, under its old name of Pfalzburg. The United States Air Forces in Europe built an air base near the city in 1953. The base was returned in 1967 to the French government, which redesignated it as Camp de la Horie. The base is currently used by the French military's 1er R√©giment d'H√©licopt√®res de Combat.  Events  The town is home to the annual Erckmann-Chatrian summer festival. It is also the birthplace of Georges Mouton.

There are cultural similarities of Kurds and their immediate neighbours in Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia. Some dishes, such as biryani, are shared with the Indian subcontinent. Kurdish food is typical of western Asian cuisine.  Culinary customs  The Kurdish diet includes a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Lamb and chicken are the primary meats. Breakfast is typically flat bread, cheese, honey, sheep or cow yogurt, and a glass of black tea. For lunch, lamb and vegetables are simmered in a tomato sauce to make a stew usually served with rice and savory dishes are usually served with rice or flat bread (Naan). Kurdistan has a climate and soil suited to grapes, pomegranates, figs, and walnuts. Kurdish honey has a clear light taste and is often sold with the honeycomb. Kurdistan also produces dairy products from sheep and cow milk. Kurds make many types of kofta and kubba, dumplings filled with meat. Kurdish cuisine makes abundant use of fresh herbs. Traditional Kurdish bread, a crusty white loaf that is baked on a round hot iron, Hawraman Sweetened black tea is a very common drink, along with bitter strong coffee. Another favourite Kurdish drink is \\"mastow\\" (Sorani) or \\"Ava Mast\\", which is yogurt and salt mixed with water. The fermented version of this is called Do (Doogh). Both beverages are often served with the addition of dill, mint, pennyroyal or seeds from the Pistacia kurdica tree. Staples of Kurdish cuisine are berbesel, biryani, dokliw, kellane, kullerenaske, kutilk, par√™v tobouli, kuki (meat or vegetable pies), birin√ß (white rice alone or with meat or vegetables and herbs), and a variety of salads, pastries, and drinks specific to different parts of Kurdistan. Other popular dishes are makluba, kofta, shifta, shilah/maraga, spinach with eggs, wheat & lentil soup, beet & meat soup, sweet turnip, cardamon cookies, burgul pilaf, menemen, meh√Ær, √ªr √ª r√ªv√Æ, yaprakh, chichma this dish is common in Erbil (Hewl√™r), tefti, niskene and nane niskan. One of the popular Kurdish dishes is Kardupilau, which is popular in Piranshahr and Mahabad. Sawarr, a traditional dish among Kurdish farmers, is made of wheat grain that is boiled, sun dried and pounded in a mortar (curn) to get rid of the husk. The wheat is then crushed in a mill (destarr). The resulting grain food can be boiled and served. Tapsi is a dish of aubergines, green peppers, courgettes and potatoes in a slightly spicy tomato sauce. Tashreeb consists of layers of naan in a sauce of green pepper, tomato, onions and chillies. A typical Kurdish breakfast consists of cheese, butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, re√ßel (jam/marmalade; a preserve of whole fruits) and honey usually consumed on top of kaymak. Sausage, baked goods and even soups can be taken as a morning meal in Kurdistan. Perhaps more so than traditional breads such as pide, a crusty white loaf is widely consumed. A common Kurdish speciality for breakfast is called menemen, which is prepared with roasted tomatoes, peppers, olive oil and eggs. Invariably, black tea is served at breakfast.  Holiday celebrations During the festival of Newroz, Kurds enjoy picnics in the countryside, eating traditional food, often with dolma, and dancing the traditional Kurdish dance called Halperke. Kurdish people also enjoy Eid food such as chicken, rice, dolma and biryani.

The name was in honour of racer Renzo Pasolini, nicknamed \\"Paso\\", who died on 20 May 1973 in an accident at the Monza race track during the Italian motorcycle Grand Prix (Gran Premio motociclistico d'Italia).Some sources refer to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where Pasolini was killed as Grand Prix of Nations (cf Circuit des Nations which is in Switzerland, not Monza, Associated Press, 1973), or as the \\"Nations Grand Prix at Monza\\" (Fallon 2010) Background The Cagiva (from CAstiglioni GIovanni VArese) company, founded by the Castiglioni brothers, needed an engine ‚Äì while Ducati, who had just been released from a difficult past of statutory public management (IRI), needed revenue. Over a series of Italian style meetings/lunches in 1984, they agreed a deal for Ducati to supply engines to Cagiva ‚Äì and then go out of the business of producing motorcycles. However, the Castiglioni brothers of Cagiva were eventually offered a deal to buy Ducati, subject to the Ducati name living on as an actual motorcycle product. On closure of the deal, Ducati engines were instantly installed in a number of Cagiva bikes, which included the Alazzurra and the Elefant enduro bike. At the time of the takeover, due to its financial difficulties Ducati was in a state of suspended animation with regards to engineering development. By that time, the classic bevel drive V-twin, which was old and expensive to produce, had been replaced by the belt-drive Pantah, designed by Fabio Taglioni. The Pantah was already known to be a strong and capable engine, and known to deliver in the Ducati 750 F1. The Pantah engine is equipped with desmodromic valves and has been constantly developed up to the present day. And around it Cagiva wanted a Ducati motorcycle unlike any other, that showed the world both Ducati's capabilities, and where it would go in the future. The design challenge A 1989 Ducati 906 Paso The challenge consisted in constructing a bike with innovative technical characteristics and image to fight the intense Japanese competition. To undertake the ambitious objective Ducati hired Massimo Tamburini, co-founder of Bimota. Tamburini would go on to design the Ducati 916 and MV Agusta F4 series, included in the Guggenheim Museum's The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition of 1988‚Äì1999, and the MV Agusta Brutale series. Tamburini decided to streamline the bike and its 750cc motor in a close-fitting integral fairing that hid all mechanical parts - one of the first motorcycles to do this, along with the Honda CBR Hurricane series, introduced the same year. He also reversed the rear cylinder head in order to meet emissions and noise restrictions abroad. The Paso 750 was equipped with latest-generation technical features: square frame tubes made in chromoly steel, rear aluminium swingarm with progressive suspension, 16-inch wheels with radial tires, air-and-oil cooled engine, electronic ignition and a comprehensive dashboard. The finished design was christened the Paso 750 and debuted at the 1985 Milan Motorcycle Show, along with a 350 cc version that was never produced. Although initially offered only in red, by 1988 it was offered in red, blue and pearl white. Ducati and Cagiva had hopes that the new machine would redefine sports touring motorcycling and complement their sportsbike line, especially in the American market. Sales and development A 1993 Ducati 907 i.e. The commercial success didn't come however, and worldwide the Paso 750 only sold 4,863 units between its introduction in 1986 and 1988. Only 700 were imported into the United States in 1987. The Paso was more expensive and had lower performance (72.5 hp and 210 km/h top speed) than its competitors, and had some reliability and rideability problems with the electrical and fuel systems, due to the use of an automotive Weber carburetor, which was ill-suited to a small-capacity motorcycle engine. In 1989 the Paso 906 was introduced to replace the 750, with a six-speed gearbox, a 904 cc engine which provided 88 hp and a 220 km/h top speed. The bike still had the same automotive carburetor and unreliable electrical system, but its greatest development was the incorporation of liquid cooling. 1,802 Paso 906's were built between 1988 and 1989. After further development, the final version of the design came in 1991 with the 907 i.e. (iniezione elettronica); now without the name \\"Paso\\". The engine remained liquid-cooled and the carburetor was replaced by the most modern Weber-Marelli IAW 043 system that integrated ignition and electronic fuel injection, which transformed the rideability of the bike. Power increased to 90 hp and top speed to 230 km/h. The wheels were changed to 17 inches, giving the bike more stability. Despite these advances sales of this model remained sluggish, and when production ceased in 1992 only 2,303 907IE's had been built.

They were later joined by Gordon Young (guitar and keyboards) and Karl North (ex Rosetta Stone) (bass guitar). Their musical style combined elements of goth, industrial, rock, and electronic. The band sold over 16,000 albums in their history, with their last studio album, Asphyxia, rated at 8/10 in Rock Sound magazine, 4K in Kerrang! and 8.5 in Terrorizer. Their 1995 album In Amber received a glowing review in The Catholic Times, where it was named 'Album of the month'. Mick Mercer's Hex Files: The Goth Bible (1996) described the Dream Disciples as \\"one of the hardest working bands around.\\" This was partly due to the band's extensive touring around Europe. In 2001, they played at the Eurorock festival (in Neerpelt, Belgium); they also headlined the Whitby Gothic Weekend (England), playing a total of four times, with a final performance in April 2004, supporting The Mission.

In that time, the group released two full-length albums and a compilation of early recordings.Colin Larkin The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Kollington - Morphine 2006 - Page 178 \\"Relocating to Washington, DC, at the dawn of the 90s, Leo turned up in the mod rock outfit Chisel. This underrated band issued 1996's 8 A.M. All Day and the following year's Set You Free before splitting up.\\" Early years Chisel began in 1990 on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, when classmates Ted Leo (guitar/vocals), Chris Infante (bass), and John Dugan (drums) began practicing in the basement of a campus dormitory. Leo had played punk shows with bands such as Animal Crackers in New York's all-ages scene and Dugan had drummed with the Washington, D.C. area punk act Indian Summer from the age of fifteen. The band quickly went from playing a covers set (Wire, Misfits, Buzzcocks, Mission of Burma) to playing original songs written by Leo. Chisel began to perform at various college venues in the Midwest and Northeast, visiting clubs such as D.C. Space in Washington and ABC No Rio in New York City. In 1991, the band released its first single, \\"Swamp Fox/Spike\\" b/w \\"Listen\\", on Assembly Records, and followed it up with appearances on compilations released by college radio stations WVFI in Notre Dame, Indiana and WPRB in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1992, Infante graduated from college and was replaced on bass by Chris Norborg, who also provided the backing vocal harmonies that soon became integral to Chisel's sound. It was during this period that the band began to change its style from traditional emo-influenced pop punk that was inspired by contemporaries in Washington, D.C., to more of a mod-influenced band in the vein of the Small Faces and The Jam. In 1994, the band members relocated to Washington where Dugan had been interning with Amnesty International. 8 A.M. All Day In 1995, Chisel issued its first full-length CD release with New Jersey's Gern Blandsten label, Nothing New, which included a number of new songs recorded with Guy Picciotto of Fugazi in his home studio as well as recordings done the previous year in Chicago with Tortoise soundman Casey Rice. It was followed in 1996 by 8 a.m. All Day, an album of all-new material recorded in the basement studio of Velocity Girl guitarist Archie Moore and produced by the band itself. By this time, Chisel was touring as a support act for bands like Fugazi, Velocity Girl, Blonde Redhead and Tuscadero. Following the release of 8 a.m. All Day, the band gained a growing following in the rock clubs of New York, Chicago and Boston and was being courted by dozens of record labels. Set You Free For its next album, the band enlisted Nicolas Vernhes and his Rare Book Room studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn to record brand new material. The band first recorded a single, \\"It's Alright, You're Okay\\", in the studio and few months later booked Vernhes for 10 days. Within those ten days, the band tracked and mixed 16 songs. This new set of material found the band incorporating various Britpop influences, horns, Hammond organ, and thicker sonics into its sound. But the band also pared some pieces back to an almost minimalist rock aesthetic in order to push Leo's increasingly dark, personal lyrics to the fore. At the other end of the spectrum, Norborg contributed lead vocals to his own compositions \\"Oh Dear Friends\\" and \\"Morley Timmons\\". Leo also soloed on guitar more often on the album. The band released its second and final LP/CD, Set You Free, in mid-1997, and set off on a well- attended tour with Boston band Karate. Chisel played its last show on May 16, 1997 in Knoxville, TN at the end of its tour. Plans to tour the West Coast and Europe were scrapped. A compilation of Chisel rarities has been in the works for some time, but has no release date.

Population: History It was first mentioned in the chronicles in 1137 (according to other sources‚Äîin 1138) as the pogost of Todma (). It was founded by Novgorodians, who used the Sukhona as the main waterway leading to the north and eventually to the White Sea. The name \\"Totma\\" is nevertheless of Finno-Ugrian origin, which, together with archeological discoveries, indicates that an earlier settlement on the site of the present town was established by the Merya people. The original pogost was located downstream of the current location, close to the mouth of the Staraya Totma River. In the 13th century, salt production started around Totma and the town was relocated. In 1539, Totma was plundered by Kazan Tatars; a fortress was built after this event. In 1554, monk Feodosy Sumorin founded the Transfiguration Monastery. In the 16th‚Äì17th centuries, Totma was one of the most prosperous towns of the Russian North, due to the trade and to the salt production. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Totma was visited several times by Peter the Great, which was rather exceptional given the remote location of the town. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Totma was included into Archangelgorod Governorate and named one of the towns constituting the governorate.–£–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∏ –æ —Ä–æ—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫ –Ω–∏–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ In the 18th century, Totma was one of the main centers of the exploration of and the trade with Alaska. In particular, Ivan Kuskov, the first administrator of Fort Ross, a Russian fortress in California, was a native of Totma. In 1780, Totma became the seat of Totemsky Uyezd of Vologda Viceroyalty, and since 1796 it was a part of Vologda Governorate. In the 19th century, Totma quickly lost its significance as the foreign trade was rerouted from Arkhangelsk to St. Petersburg and the river transportation was gradually replaced by railways and highways. The railway from Vologda to Arkhangelsk was constructed along the shortest way via Konosha and bypassed Totma, while the old highway from Moscow to Arkhangelsk never ran via Totma. Until the late 1990s, the only road through Totma connected Vologda with Veliky Ustyug via Nikolsk. In the second half of the 19th century, Totma was frequently used as a destination for political exile. On July 15, 1929, several governorates, including Vologda Governorate, were merged into Northern Krai and the uyezds were abolished. Totma became the administrative center of Totemsky District, which included parts of former Totemsky Uyezd. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Totma serves as the administrative center of Totemsky District.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Totemsky District as the town of district significance of Totma.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Totma is incorporated within Totemsky Municipal District as Totma Urban Settlement.Law #1124-OZ Economy =Industry= The most important industry in Totma is the food industry. =Transportation= Paved roads connect Totma with Vologda via Kadnikov (southwest), Veliky Ustyug via Nyuksenitsa (northeast), and Nikolsk via Imeni Babushkina (east). Before the road between Totma and Veliky Ustyug along the Sukhona was completed in the first decade of the 2000s, the only connection between the towns was via Nikolsk. The Sukhona is navigable in Totma; however, there is no passenger navigation. Culture and recreation Totma is a historical town which preserved, along with other heritage, several churches which have all similar structure not related to any other region of Russia. A Totma church is a building on which the church proper is based on one side and the bell-tower on the other side so that the construction reminds a ship. This style is sometimes referred to as Totma Baroque. Totma contains twelve objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by Russian Federal law and additionally seventy-four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. The town of Totma is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center. The monuments classified as cultural heritage by the federal law are the following: The Church of the Entry into Jerusalem The former Spaso-Sumorin Monastery *The complex of the Resurrection Church and the Assumption Church (1744‚Äì1755) *The Nativity Church (1746‚Äì1748) *The Trinity Church in Zelenskaya Rybatskaya Sloboda (1768‚Äì1772) *The complex of the Church of the Entry into Jerusalem and the Church of St. John the Baptist (1738‚Äì1740) *The Kholodilov House (middle of 19th century) *The ensemble of Spaso-Sumorin Monastery (1685‚Äì1689) *The town hall *The house where Anatoly Lunacharsky lived in 1903-1904 Totma hosts five six museums: *The Totma Regional Museum, founded in 1915.

It tells the story of a fifteen-year-old Lebanese girl, from a Druze community, who is forced to marry her cousin across the Israeli border, but finds herself in love with an Israeli soldier. Le Cerf-volant was Sabag's most commercially and critically successful movie, and her last; she died in 2008. The film was Lebanon's official submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards. Although it never received a theatrical release in the United States, the film was released to DVD in 2009 by First Run Features. Plot The Kite is set in a village called Deir Mimas over the border of the pre-occupied territories in southern Lebanon (occupied by Israel). The 16-year-old Lebanese girl Lamia (Flavia Bechara) lives with her family in the village. Her family had promised to marry her off to her cousin Samy (Edmond Haddad), who lives on the Israeli side. Lamia's mother, Amira (Randa Asmar) was dejected and unwilling to send her daughter away because that meant that Lamia could never come back because of the tense political situation at the border. Lamia, too, is completely reluctant to agree to the marriage because she has never seen him nor does she love him. She is simply a na√Øve young teenager who has no idea about marriage. Similarly, Samy was not much interested in marrying his cousin either; however, he agreed to the marriage because he thought it would help Lamia escape her village. To conduct the wedding, since there is a no-man's land between the Lebanon side and Israel side, they communicate with each other through megaphones and can only see each other through binoculars. Before the marriage, Lamia had to get a pass from the authorities to cross the border. The day of the wedding, the entire village gathers at the border gates to witness Lamia being sent across the border. On the Israeli side, people wave a white flag as a signal to start. Lamia hugs her family and starts her long walk towards the Israeli border in her majestic wedding gown and a lone bouquet. She keeps looking back, knowing that she may never return. Meanwhile, the movie reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), stationed at the border is in love with Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy's house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; this goes on for 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who turns out to be Youssef. Samy's family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, she turns to look at Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away. Because of her continuous unpleasant behavior, Lamia becomes unwanted in Samy's house and she is forced to go back. Samy warns Lamia that no one else would want her anymore if he divorces her and she would be alone forever. Lamia faces a great dilemma because she does not want to be with her husband but she does not want to go back either (because of Youssef). Unfortunately, Lamia returns to Deir Mimas, to her and the soldier's utter disappointment. She becomes a subject of insult in her home village, which is seen when a shop-owner does not accept money from her, calling it \\"money of dishonor\\". The ending of the movie has been purposely left vague and open to interpretation. It appears like a dream or surreal scene where Lamia magically crosses the fence of the border and finally gets to be with Youssef. Production Reception The Kite was Sabag's biggest commercial and critical success, with generally positive reviews. Nitrate Online described it as a story of \\"life and love in the middle of conflict\\" with a \\"refreshingly original appeal that crosses some formidable barriers\\", while Strictly Film School called it a \\"poignant, humorous, and exquisitely realized\\" film. Less than a year after Sabag's death, when the film was out on DVD, Michael Atkinson described it on IFC.com as a \\"tragicomedy\\" and \\"absurdist\\" film, and wrote that the director's tone was \\"gentle and generous\\", except for a single scene involving the discovery of an aborted fetus which he described as \\"tasteless\\". Atkinson added that Sabag considered the points of view of each character in the film, even that of the Israeli officers. When Sabag won the Silver Lion, the Beirut-based Daily Star called the occasion \\"a triumph for Lebanese film\\". The World Press Review described this kind of reception as \\"a radical departure from the hostile press the controversial filmmaker (Sabag) once received\\". Cineuropa said that despite the subject of the story being tragic, Sabag tried to deal with it using irony and managed to \\"triumph life, love and imagination\\" at the end. Both male and female critics on the French film blog L'Oil sur L'Ecran gave it 4 out of 5 stars, with one of them noting that the film was reminiscent of Elia Suleiman's 2002 film Divine Intervention.

He was married to Catherine Dalston. He was a noted teacher and close friend of Thomas Jefferson. As royal governor of Virginia, Fauquier often hosted lavish parties where Jefferson (then a College of William and Mary student) played his violin and drank imported wines. Fauquier County in Northern Virginia is named in his honor. Also, due to his connection to several prominent members (both student and faculty) of The College of William & Mary, a building and a secret society (The Fauquier Society) on the campus are named for him. Background Fauquier was born in England. His father, Dr. John Francis Fauquier, born in Clairac, Lot-&-Garonne France, relocated to Britain to work with Sir Isaac Newton. Dr. Fauquier later became director of the Bank of England. Like his father, Fauquier was brought up to be a renaissance man with expertise in both science and industry, with interests in the arts and charity. He became director of the South Sea Company in 1751. In that same year he also became one of the governors of the charitable Foundling Hospital for abandoned children. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753. He came to the colony of Virginia as lieutenant governor in 1758, succeeding Robert Dinwiddie, and remained in that position until his death. He published several financial essays, among them the idea Raising Money for Support of the War, which was published in 1756, and served as an audition for the replacement of his Virginian predecessor.archive.org: \\"An essay on ways and means for raising money for the support of the present war, without increasing the public debts: inscribed to the Right Honourable George Lord Anson, first Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, &c.;\\" by Fauquier, Francis, 1704?-1768 In the absence of the governors‚Äîthe Earl of Loudoun (1756‚Äì63) and Jeffery Amherst (1763‚Äì68)‚Äîhe was the chief administrative officer. Instructions sent with him demanded that the office of treasurer of the colony be taken from the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, but he disobeyed these instructions and gained and maintained the friendship of the house. He commissioned in 1759 Andrew Burnaby to write a series of observations upon the state of the colonies.archive.org: \\"Travels through the middle settlements in North-America, in the years 1759 and 1760 : with observations upon the state of the colonies\\", by Burnaby, Andrew, 1732-1812; Fauquier, Francis, 1704?-1768 In 1760 he informed the government of the trend toward opposition to British policies in the colony and proposed that British tax policy be changed. In 1765, however, he dissolved the House of Burgesses when it passed a resolution against the Stamp Act. Patrick Henry was a thorn in Fauquier's side for some time; he always called Henry \\"young and hotheaded\\". Except in combating disloyalty, he sympathized with the colonists, and was one of the ablest and most popular of the royal governors. Fauquier died in Virginia in 1768 at the age of 65. A residence hall at the College of William and Mary is named for Fauquier.

The 10th Ward is one of the 17 wards of New Orleans.New Orleans Districts and Wards The ward is one of the city's Uptown wards, formerly the old Faubourg Lafayette annexed by New Orleans in the 1850s. Boundaries The roughly wedge-shaped Ward stretches back from the Mississippi River. The lower boundary is Felicity Street, across which is the 1st Ward, then Martin Luther King Boulevard (formerly Melpomene Street), across which is the 2nd Ward. The upper boundary is First Street, across which lies the 11th Ward. Cityscape and landmarks Near the river the ward includes part of the Lower Garden District and the former location of America's first experiment with large-scale public housing, started here in 1937, when, as part of the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the loan to commence construction of the St. Thomas Housing Project. In Central City it includes the Oretha Castle Haley commercial district. Residents The 10th Ward has been home to such notables as jazz musicians Buddy Bolden and George Brunies History In 1718, the City of New Orleans was established. The city was later divided into many neighborhoods, streets, and squares. Faubourg Lafayette is one of the many neighborhoods of New Orleans. Faubourg Lafayette was united by an act of legislation, prior to being classified as an official neighborhood. However, unlike most of the other neighborhoods in the city, Faubourg Lafayette once belonged to another region of Louisiana before it united with the great city of New Orleans. This area was originally part of the city of Lafayette, Louisiana before New Orleans and Lafayette‚Äôs legislation consolidated in making it great one big city. Many other neighborhoods like Faubourg Nuns and Faubourg Delassize were also a part of Lafayette, Louisiana prior to this consolidation. In 1818, Faubourg Lafayette was bought as a neighborhood and became a subdivision in 1824. In its newborn years as a city, it was cut into blocks and squares by John Poultney. Poultney acquired this neighborhood from Madame Rousseau, who like Samuel Herman bought his neighborhood from the heirs of Valery Delaissize. Both of these neighborhoods started as plantations, but the new owners decided to downsize them in order to make more living space available for the growing population. In 1796, Bertrand Gravier helped enlarge Faubourg by including Phillipa St., which is now called Poydress Street. Years later, in 1997, Gravier died and Jean Gravier, his brother, was appointed to be the new owner of this prosperous estate. He continued in his brother‚Äôs footsteps by further extending the Faubourg to Circus Street, which is currently regarded to as Rampart Street. As Jean Gravier continued to expand the Faubourg region, he included land that was located near Poydras St., and approximately 40 feet in width, for a Canal. This canal linked with an agency in Bayou St. John, and flowed into an area which was called Hagan Avenue; although, this region between the canal is now noted as Jefferson Davis Parkway. In addition, to these expansions, Jean Gravier also designated a tract for a basin that linked to Canal St. During this time, the basin was an uninhabited district of land which was allocated for the community. He later called this Basin ‚ÄúPlace Gravier‚Äù. Jean Gravier didn‚Äôt realize that the canal and Place Gravier would become the basis of a dispute between the City of New Orleans and the Carrollton Railroad Company. At this time, the Carrollton Railroad company possessed the canal, the basin, and asserted ownership of segments of Place Gravier. The dispute between the City of New Orleans, and the railroad company concluded when the Supreme Court of the Territory of Orleans announced a judgement in support of Jean Gravier, on May 23, 1805. Later in 1841, the Supreme Court of the state of Louisiana, pronounced that the Canal and Basin were property of to the Railroad Company. However, years later in 1876, the Supreme Court altered their judgement and decided that the ‚ÄúPlace Gravier‚Äù would be owned by the City of New Orleans and be a location for the general public. In 1897, the City of New Orleans took legal action against Philip Werlien for possession of this basin. This location was declared to be public property as stated by the judgment the Supreme Court announced in 1841. The City of New Orleans won the lawsuit against Werlien and the Supreme Court of the state of Louisiana. Werlein took the litigation to the Supreme Court of the United States and it rendered a judgment in support of him. The Supreme Court of the United States reasoned that the City of New Orleans had lost ownership of Place Gravier. Philip Werlien was able to obtain possession of this disputed property, which is now the site of the Hotel de Sotoe. Faubourg Lafayette is distinctive in its perimeters because of its unique history from vast contributors. Faubourg Lafayette is part of the upper section of New Orleans. The perimeters of Faubourg Lafayette are Saint Charles Street, Calliope Street, Jackson Avenue, and Simon Bolivar Avenue. This area is known for its diverse mixture of businesses, personal homes, schools, and many main attractions for tourist.

Typically born into the profession, jewelers worked in workshops and, using a myriad of techniques, creating many beautiful objects. They were primarily commissioned by the Royal Family and Royal court, although occasionally they created pieces for other members of the nobility or for Buddhist and Taoist temples. Adapting the system from the previous Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty mandated all artisanal professions, such as that of a jeweler, hereditary and binding from generation to generation.Dagmar Schafer, The Crafting of the 10,000 Things (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2011), p. 95 Beginning under the first Ming Emperor, the Hongwu Emperor, a complex system revolving around artisan craftsmanship developed in order to both fulfill the quotas imposed by the Ming Court as well as to protect the rights of the individual artisan and his family.Li He and Michael Knight, Power and Glory: Court Arts of China‚Äôs Ming Dynasty (Asian Art Museum: Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, 2008), p. 25 Guilds and other partnerships also developed in order to protect the different artisans themselves. Within the Royal Court, there was also the Imperial Jewelry Service, which meant that there was both always some sort of official oversight over the jeweler profession as well as a steady demand for the labor of a jeweler.David Ake Sensabaugh, ‚ÄúGold and Jade: The Material World of the Early Ming Princes,‚Äù in Royal Taste: The Art of Princely Taste in Fifteenth Century China, edited by Fan Jeremy Zhang (New York: Scala Publishers, 2015) p. 104 One technique commonly used by jewelers during the Ming period was filigree.David Ake Sensabaugh, ‚ÄúGold and Jade: The Material World of the Early Ming Princes,‚Äù in Royal Taste: The Art of Princely Taste in Fifteenth Century China, edited by Fan Jeremy Zhang (New York: Scala Publishers, 2015) p. 85 Jewelers would twist together thin pieces of metal, such as gold or silver, to create intricate patterns and beautiful shapes. Hairpins provide some of the best example of filigree work during the Ming period. These pieces were delicate and appeared almost otherworldly in their complexity. Through hairpins one can often get a glance at a jeweler's best work, as hairpins were highly prized by the elite women in the Ming Court. and the level of design and grandeur of the hairpin represented the status of the lady it adorned. Another technique often associated with jewelers in the Ming times was gem embedding.David Ake Sensabaugh, ‚ÄúGold and Jade: The Material World of the Early Ming Princes,‚Äù in Royal Taste: The Art of Princely Taste in Fifteenth Century China, edited by Fan Jeremy Zhang (New York: Scala Publishers, 2015) p. 118 Beautifully cut gemstones, imported from Southeast Asia, would be placed in designs of delicate gold filigree, creating truly ornate pieces. Gold, silver, and jade were some of the most commonly used materials by the jewelers in Ming times. Assorted gemstones and pearls were also used frequently along with the other materials. For the members of the Royal Court, a variety of headdresses, belts, trinkets, and other ornaments worn to denote status were made from a combination of silks and gold and other precious jewels. Beyond jewelry and other wearable goods, jewelers also created ornate items such as cups, bowls, trays, and tweezers for use within the Ming Court. In order to procure the raw materials to create these highly sought after products, jewelers had to turn to the court eunuchs who oversaw the mines, imports from surrounding regions, as well as tributes from neighboring states. As evidenced by the abundance of gold and silver products found in Ming tombs, many of these items were so valued that they were chosen or commissioned to go into the afterlife.David Ake Sensabaugh, ‚ÄúGold and Jade: The Material World of the Early Ming Princes,‚Äù in Royal Taste: The Art of Princely Taste in Fifteenth Century China, edited by Fan Jeremy Zhang (New York: Scala Publishers, 2015) p. 21 It is from some of these pieces, preserved in the tombs, that one can see some of the best work of jewelers during the Ming Dynasty. These techniques, practices, and usage of precious metals and gemstones did not originate under the Ming Dynasty; rather, it is thought that the particular styles were inherited from the previous Yuan Dynasty, the Mongols.David Ake Sensabaugh, ‚ÄúGold and Jade: The Material World of the Early Ming Princes,‚Äù in Royal Taste: The Art of Princely Taste in Fifteenth Century China, edited by Fan Jeremy Zhang (New York: Scala Publishers, 2015) p. 114 Under the Ming Dynasty jewelers further refined and explored these techniques to create pieces distinctive of the Ming period.

Fishing is one of the main activities, including that of tuna and coral. History As with many other places in Calabria, Pizzo claims ancient origins. The town may have been founded by colonists from an unknown site in ancient Magna Grecia, but there is currently no documentary or archeological evidence to support this. Consequently, the history of Pizzo begins in 1300 when the existence of a community of Basilian monks, a fort, and a fishing village is documented . The name Pizzo (translated either as bird's beak or projecting point) fits perfectly with the tuffa promontory that juts out into the sea near the mouth of the river Angitola. For centuries tuna was trapped in the beaches around Pizzo, especially in the months of May and June. Despite fading in importance over time this activity continued until the 1970s in the Centofontane area, where nets were spread to corral tuna from offshore. Ruins of the activity remain. The activity is now banned. The Piedigrotta and Prangi areas include some sea caves, and \\"the cave of the Saracen\\", although largely eroded today, was supposedly used by Saracen pirates to store booty and people captured during their raids along the coast of Calabria. The former King of Naples Joachim Murat, who was the brother-in-law of Napoleon, was imprisoned for several days in the town's Aragonese castle and then sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad on October 13, 1815, in the main hall of the castle and was possibly buried in the church of San Giorgio. Paradoxically, the castle is now called Castello Murat. Inside the castle is the Provincial Museum Murat. In 1783 the town was almost destroyed by an earthquake, and it suffered some damage from the same cause in 1905. Main sights It has an old castle, built by the Aragonese in the 15th century, in which Joachim Murat, ex-king of Naples, was shot on October 13, 1815. Other sights include the Baroque church of St. George (1632) and the cave church of Piedigrotta (17th century) Food Pizzo is famous in the area for its Tartufo, a large ball of ice cream filled with molten chocolate.

He acted in a couple of American films in the late 1960s like as Claude Jade's husband in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz. In 1999, he once again played Forestier in Beau Travail, a highly praised variation of Billy Budd, directed by Claire Denis. He continued to work with her. Early life and education He was born as Mischa Subotzki in France in 1935, to anti-Bolshevik parents from the Soviet Union who had immigrated a few years earlier. His father was an engineer in Moscow, and his mother was born in Azerbaijan. Michel Subor has a sister who moved to the United States as an adult. Career His career started with small roles in Frou-Frou (1955) and Un dr√¥le de dimanche (1958), followed by playing Roger Hanin's son in Mon pote le gitan (1959) . First leading role by playing the lover of Brigitte Bardot's character in La Bride sur le Cou (1961). The year before he had completed Subor's most important early role was as Bruno Forestier, a French deserter in Geneva in Jean-Luc Godard's Le Petit Soldat (1960), set against terrorist acts in France and Switzerland during the guerre sans nom of the Algerian War. The film starred Anna Karina in her debut. Due to its politically sensitive content, the French government banned its release until 1963, after the end of the war.

But the producer had not acquired the rights and the film was left unfinished in 1965. Subor was also cast in American films, appearing in Clive Donner's comedy What's New, Pussycat? (1965) as the lover Philippe. In 1968/69 he starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz (1969), featured as the journalist Fran√ßois Picard, the husband of the character played by Claude Jade. Hitchcock changes Subor's role and let Fran√ßois Picard survive the assassination attempt from the novel, so he returns wounded (\\"I've been shot, just a little\\") into Claude Jade's arms. He appeared in Jean-Louis Bertucelli's The Imprecator (1977) and G√©rard Blain's The Rebel (1980), but felt he never made the transition to mainstream cinema. Blain used Subor again in Amen he (1999). That year's renewal of Subor's career included a role in Claire Denis's Beau Travail, as a Foreign Legion captain named Bruno Forestier.

It operates as both a producing house - staging at least six of its own productions each year, and a receiving house - hosting work from visiting companies throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom including drama, musicals, contemporary & classical dance, children‚Äôs theatre, comedy, jazz and opera. It is home to the Dundee Rep Ensemble, Scotland‚Äôs only full-time company of actors, as well as Scotland‚Äôs principal contemporary dance company, Scottish Dance Theatre. ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôThe Rep‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô building is located in Tay Square at the centre of the city‚Äôs \\"cultural quarter\\" in the West End. Recognised to be among the top regional theatres in the UK, it plays to an average audience of over 70,000 people a year attracting a very broad cross-section of the local population in terms of age and occupation.  History  Dundee has had a number of purpose built theatres. Apart from early wooden theatres, the Theatre Royal in Castle Street opened in 1810 and became firmly established from the 1840s until 1885 when the new Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre and Opera House opened on the Seagate. Others included the Alhambra - renamed the Whitehall in the 1970s - the Palace, renamed the Theatre Royal in the 1960s, and the King's Theatre in the Cowgate which opened in 1908. By around 1920 many theatres had converted into cinemas, and for most of the 1930s Dundee no longer had a designated drama theatre. Robert Thornely ‚Äì Manager of the last touring company to perform in Dundee was determined to find a home in the city for his professional theatre company. He approached the Dundee Dramatic Society, an amateur company, who, also faced with nowhere to perform had recently purchased their own premises in the form of a disused jute mill. In May 1939 Dundee Repertory Theatre was founded as a collaboration between professionals with amateur support. Around this time people thought it strange to be concentrating on drama during the turmoil of World War II. However the company performed weekly repertory during the war and the rest of the 1940s and throughout the 1950s. The company was housed in Foresters' Hall (6 Nicoll street to 3 Rattray Street) which was built for the Ancient Order of Foresters in 1901, when in June 1963 a fire completely destroyed the building and the Rep was forced to live a nomadic existence for a short period. Eventually a temporary refuge was found in the converted former Dudhope Church on the Lochee Road of Dundee although the company remained at the venue for a further 18 years. After negotiation with the City of Dundee District Council and the Scottish Arts Council it was agreed that the company would have its own purpose built premises on land donated by University of Dundee. Work began in January 1979 under the leadership of Robert Robertson who had been Artistic Director for a number of years and who was instrumental in overseeing the building and completion of the new theatre. However, the building work looked like being stopped in its tracks due to rising prices and inflation. A public appeal was launched which raised a massive ¬£60,000 in under six weeks, reaching an eventual total of ¬£200,000 outstripping all possible expectations, in a city that was then in the midst of economic recession. The new theatre opened on 8 April 1982, designed by Dundee-based architects Nicoll Russell Studios. The building proved a great success - with a personal 455-seater auditorium, providing one of the best stages in Scotland in terms of its relationship with its audience, it received a civic commendation from The Civic Trust Award in 1984 and in 1986 won the RIBA Architecture Award. Robert Robertson retired from Dundee Rep in 1990. In April 1992 Hamish Glen was appointed Artistic Director, the same year saw the building extended and undertook a major refurbishment to facilitate a growing community and education department and to include a dance studio as well as extending its existing workshop, wardrobe and rehearsal capacity. In 1996 it received the prestigious TMA Martini Award for the Best Overall Production in the UK and in September 1999 it opened its doors to one of the most ambitious experiments in Scottish Theatre for many years ‚Äì a permanent company of 14 actors. James Brining became Artistic Director in 2003 and during that time the company created over 50 productions. The Ensemble developed its international reputation, being the first UK company to tour to Iran in 30 years with Shakespeare‚Äôs The Winter‚Äôs Tale. In 2005, it visited the prestigious Cerventino Festival in Mexico with a new version of Jarry‚Äôs Ubu the King and in 2006 it took David Greig‚Äôs Dr Korzcak‚Äôs Example to Tokyo and Hiroshima. The company has developed co-productions with some of the UK‚Äôs leading producers including the Barbican, the Young Vic, National Theatre of Scotland, Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, The Traverse Theatre Company, Paines Plough and the Tron Theatre, performing in all of Scotland‚Äôs major venues. The repertoire was broad, encompassing Shakespeare, musicals, American classics, new plays and work for children and young people. In 2007 Dundee Rep Ensemble created Sunshine on Leith featuring the music of The Proclaimers. It soon became a Scottish favourite and has been seen by more than 200,000 people. In 2013 a film version of the musical premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. In May 2012 it was announced that Fleur Darkin was to become the new Artistic Director of Scottish Dance Theatre. Shortly after this it was announced that current Associate Director Jemima Levick and former Artistic Director of The Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh would share the position of Joint Artistic Directors of Dundee Rep Theatre as of February 2013. Since then Dundee Rep have teamed up with National Theatre of Scotland to present the World Premi√®re of the cult classic Let The Right One In, collaborated with the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh with Time and the Conways, presented the Scottish Premiere of David Greig‚Äôs Victoria. The Rep is now home to over 20 resident performers who are rooted in the region but are nationally and internationally orientated. As the theatre grows, so does the ambition. Now the most awarded theatre in Scotland and with more Ensemble and Scottish Dance Theatre performances than ever before, Dundee Rep Theatre has cemented itself as one of the leading producing theatres in the UK. In September 2018 it was reported that the Rep was considering leaving its current building for new purpose built premises. The Rep's artistic director Andrew Panton stated that it had outgrown its present home and that the building needed a lot of work. Panton suggested that a newly built theatre should be able to seat 800 to 1000 people (as opposed to the current building's capacity of about 400) and have greater flexibility to be able to house different sizes of audience. He suggested that this could tie in to the Rep's 80th anniversary celebrations in 2019 and be the next major cultural project in Dundee following the completion and opening of V&A; Dundee in 2018.  The Rep Ensemble  The Rep Ensemble as of 2010 approaches the start of its twelfth year, having proven to be a long term success after performing numerous successful productions, including a yearly Christmas pantomime as well as challenging renditions of famous plays such as A Doll's House and The Elephant Man. The presence of the Ensemble at the Theatre allows for the organisation of workshops, readings, and other ways of reaching out to the community that would simply not be possible for a theatre without an official troupe of actors. It also allowed for the production of Sunshine on Leith, the successful musical that has been on tour three times now. The Rep Ensemble has won numerous awards and continues to further the ambition Hamish Glen had for the project, with performances in 2011 of The Rise & Fall of Little Voice and Anna Karenina.  The Rep today  In Spring 2003 James Brining and Dominic Hill replaced Hamish Glen as joint Artistic Directors. Since then the theatre's work has been seen locally, elsewhere in Scotland and further afield. In the 2004 Critics Awards For Theatre In Scotland (CATS), Dundee Rep 5 awards ‚Äì Best Production (Scenes From An Execution), Best Director (Dominic Hill for ‚ÄòScenes...‚Äô), Best Actor (John Bett), Best Design & Best Music (both for ‚ÄòTwelfth Night‚Äô) as well as five other nominations. In 2004 a new ¬£1 million dance studio was completed to house Scottish Dance Theatre. The Rep's in-house productions offer a repertoire of acclaimed works. The Rep also commissions playwrights to create new works and translate and adapt classical texts, making it relevant to Scotland‚Äôs contemporary cultural and social climate. A recent venture was the tour of its production of The Winter's Tale to Iran under the auspices of the British Council's five year initiative 'Connecting Futures'. This was the first major cultural event to be shown in Iran for 25 years, and the first ever British Council theatre tour to Iran. The set was built entirely in Iran, under the direction of John Miller, the company's production manager and played at the Vahdat Hall, Tehran. In May 2015 Dundee Repertory Theatre appointed Nick Parr as its new chief executive officer. He took over from Philip Howard, who held the joint roles of CEO and, with Jemima Levick, joint artistic director. He leads Dundee Rep Theatre Ltd solely in the role of chief executive, working alongside Levick as sole artistic director and Fleur Darkin who is artistic director of Scottish Dance Theatre. Levick left the Dundee Repertory Theatre in 2016. Levick was replaced by Joe Douglas in April 2016 in the role of Associate Artistic Director.http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/article/joe-douglas-16 In July 2016 Andrew Panton was appointed new Artistic Director at Dundee Rep to take over from Douglas in the Autumn of 2017.http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/article/artistic- director-16  Notable alumni and players  Richard Todd began his acting career with the Company in the 1930s, returning to perform with it after military service in World War II.

It comprises upland (which includes around of wetlands) and submerged. The most significant natural feature is the first-magnitude headspring basin, which produces up to of fresh water per day, forming the Rainbow River. The looking-glass waters of Rainbow Springs come from several vents, not one large bubbling spring. The river itself supports a wide variety of fish, wildlife, and plants, many within easy viewing by visitors. In total, the park contains 11 distinct natural communities, including sandhills, flatwoods, upland mixed forests, and hydric hammocks. Visitors are able to see a variety of wildflowers in season; oak, longleaf pines, magnolia, dogwood, red maple, redbud, cypress, sabal, and hickory trees; gray squirrels, red-shouldered hawks, swallowtail kites, barred owls, whitetail deer, and a wide variety of wading birds. The relative peace and quiet of the winter season offers much for the nature enthusiast. An interpretive room located in the visitor center displays the historical, natural, and cultural resources of the park.  History  Rainbow Springs became a privately owned theme park in the 1930s, where visitors could look out into the water at eye level in a sub-boat. In addition to waterfalls, a zoo, rodeo, gift shops, and a monorail were added. Due to the development of Florida's interstate highway system, the attractions in Orlando drew many people away from Rainbow Springs and other small towns that hosted similar attractions. As a result, Rainbow Springs closed in 1974. After years of being closed, Rainbow Springs later reopened as a state park in the 1990s. Residents of the area created a support organization for the park called the Friends of Rainbow Springs. By physically clearing paths and bringing life back to the gardens, this group helped lead the opening of the park. Geography The Rainbow River flows from Rainbow Springs into the Withlacoochee River. Ecology Among the wildlife of the park are gray squirrels, otter, turtles, alligators, and many types of birds. Among the birds are songbirds, hummingbirds, red-shoulder hawks, and swallowtail kites, as well as ospreys, barred owls, and various water birds. The site has a nature trail. Recreational activities and amenities Activities include swimming, snorkeling, canoeing, kayaking, and wildlife viewing. Amenities include a nature trail, a full-service campground, a picnic area with pavilions, canoe and kayak rentals, and gardens, as well as access to the Rainbow River. It also has waterfalls and phosphate pits from former open-mining activity. A small zoo complex was once located in the gardens. Some of the facilities still exist, but are no longer used. At the entrance is a small visitor center, shop, snack bar, and restrooms, located in an elevated position above Rainbow Springs with a good view along the Rainbow River. Hours Florida state parks are open between 8:00 am and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

He first appeared disguised as the villain Polestar in Green Lantern Corps #201 (June 1986), then disguised as the villains Truk, Malignon, and his true form in Green Lantern Corps #202 (July 1986). Ub'x was named after the famed Walt Disney animator Ub Iwerks. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Doctor Ub'x's pre-Crisis life was revealed in as a flashback in Green Lantern Corps #203 (August 1986). Ub'x was born on H'lven, a planet located in Sector 1014 of the DC Universe. Ub'x resembles an anthropomorphic combination of a squirrel and a beaver. Possessed of great intelligence and an equally great desire for power, Ub'x left his homeworld and created a powerful military force known as the \\"Crabster Army.\\" Under Ub'x's direction, this army conquered most of the planets in the sector and defeated the fox-like creature that was the Green Lantern of that region of space. Turning his attention to his homeworld, Ub'x easily defeated the peaceful inhabitants of H'lven and sentenced the leader of the resistance, Ch'p, to death. Ch'p was visited in his cell by one of the Guardians of the Universe, who offered the heroic H'lvenite a Green Lantern power ring. Using the ring, Ch'p became the new Green Lantern of sector 1014 and swept Ub'x's forces from the planet. Defeated but unrepentant, Ub'x commenced a campaign to overcome his new adversary, engaging the Green Lantern in a series of battles to test Ch'p's abilities, and discovering Ch'p's secret identity. Using his information, Ub'x kidnapped Ch'p's girlfriend and threatened to feed her to the terrible Borgul Bears unless the Green Lantern gave up his ring. Ch'p gave in to the demand, but not before commanding the ring to capture Ub'x in a giant nutcracker at a later moment. Defeated once again, Dr. Ub'x retreated to his well-guarded fortress to hatch a new plot. Utilizing his powerful intelligence, Ub'x created a device designed to match the power of a Green Lantern. Dubbing the device the \\"Sucker Stick\\", Ub'x completed his work just as the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" struck his homeworld. Realizing that the timeline was being rewritten, Ub'x used the power of the Sucker Stick to keep himself from being erased from history. The Sucker Stick converted his body into energy. =Post-Crisis= Ub'x eventually followed his nemesis Ch'p to Earth. He was able to convert his energy form into copies of other supervillains, and engaged the members of the Green Lantern Corps. Once he defeated the Green Lanterns, he was able to convert his body back into its original shape and prepared to kill Ch'p. Before he could, he suddenly realized that Ch'p was the only remaining connection to his past. Unable to kill the Green Lantern, Ub'x lost control of his Sucker Stick and was almost erased from history, but Ch'p intervened to prevent his demise. The two former adversaries called a truce and eventually became friends. Ub'x relocated to Africa where he began experiments to create a race of creatures similar to the rodent-like H'lvenites. Accompanying Ch'p on a mission to the future, Ub'x discovered that his experiments had succeeded, and decided to remain in the 58th century in order to aid the new species he had created (Green Lantern Corps #215, August 1987). With the subsequent revisions to the DC timeline, it is uncertain whether or not Ub'x or this alternate future continue to exist.

Population: History Considered to have been founded in the 11th century, it was first mentioned, as Zhelezny Ustyug (), in 1252, and in the following centuries was called variously Ustyuzhna Zheleznopolskaya, Ustizhna, Ustizhnya, Ustyuzhnya, and Yustyzhnya. In the 16th‚Äì18th centuries it was known mostly as Ustyuzhna-Zheleznaya or Ustyuzhna-Zheleznopolskaya, but since 1808 it had mostly been referred to by its modern name.

It was situated on the shortest route from Novgorod to the basin of the Northern Dvina, which caused an interest of the Novgorod Republic. In the 14th century, Novgorod made several attempts to establish control over the town. During the Time of Troubles, the Polish Army laid a siege on Ustyuzhna, but did not manage to conquer the town. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the territory became one of the most important centers of metal production in Russia, second only to Tula. Between 1702 and 1714, Izhinsky iron-making plant, built by the Admiralty, existed in Ustyuzhna, making it a major producer of arms. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Ustyuzhna was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate) and named one of the towns constituting the governorate.–£–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∏ –æ —Ä–æ—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫ –Ω–∏–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, which included Ustyuzhna as a part of its Belozersk Province. In 1738, Ustyuzhna was chartered and became the seat of Ustyuzhensky Uyezd. In 1776, the uyezd was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and Ustyuzhensky Uyezd was transferred to Novgorod Governorate. In June 1918, five uyezds of Novgorod Governorate, including Ustyuzhensky Uyezd, were split off to form Cherepovets Governorate, with the administrative center in Cherepovets. On August 1, 1927, Cherepovets Governorate was abolished and its territory became Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. At the same time, uyezds were abolished and Ustyuzhensky District was established, with the administrative center in Ustyuzhna. On September 23, 1937, Ustyuzhensky District was transferred to newly established Vologda Oblast and remained there ever since. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Ustyuzhna serves as the administrative center of Ustyuzhensky District and of Ustyuzhensky Selsoviet of that district, even though it is not a part of the latter.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Ustyuzhensky District as the town of district significance of Ustyuzhna.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Ustyuzhna is incorporated within Ustyuzhensky Municipal District as Ustyuzhna Urban Settlement and serves as the administrative center of the municipal district, urban settlement, and of Ustyuzhenskoye Rural Settlement, even though it is not a part of the latter.Law #1126-OD Economy =Industry= The main industrial enterprise in Ustyuzhna is a cheese production factory. =Transportation= A114 Highway, connecting Vologda to Cherepovets and St. Petersburg, passes north of Ustyuzhna.

Released in 1992, it consists of previously unreleased live recordings by the band and one previously unreleased studio song: \\"A Can√ß√£o do Senhor da Guerra\\".  Background and curation  The band had always been reluctant about releasing a compilation, which culminated in the members' feud with label EMI-Odeon when it tried to edit a compilation without talking to them first. The album would only come out their way, and ended up being produced in a rather timely occasion, since the previous studio album V tour had been prematurely aborted and the members looked for ways to earn money while vocalist, acoustic guitarist and keyboardist Renato Russo searched for help to get rid of drugs. Meanwhile, they wanted to offer something truly new and not so purely commercial to fans, in order to compensate for the cancellation of so many shows, and that's when they decided to gather live recordings, almost all of which were previously unreleased. The songs were recorded during lives performances at Parque Ant√°rtica Stadium, in S√£o Paulo, in August 1990; in Morro da Urca, Rio de Janeiro, in August 1986; some sessions at radio stations Transam√©rica FM (Rio de Janeiro), in 1988 and 1992 and R√°dio Cidade (Rio de Janeiro), in 1992; and the band's MTV Unplugged album, in 1992. The booklet says all tracks (except \\"A Can√ß√£o do Senhor da Guerra\\" and \\"Mais do Mesmo\\") were recorded in only one take and that the original tapes were not enhanced, except for edits, mixes and sound filtering. The art project was done by Fernanda Villa-Lobos and Gualter Pupo, and the album cover was drawn by drummer Marcelo Bonf√°. It was mixed in November 1992. Former bassist Renato Rocha and touring musicians are also featured. Russo and guitarist Dado Villa-Lobos agreed that the album summed up the history of the band appropriately, since it covered all lineups.  \\"A Can√ß√£o do Senhor da Guerra\\"  The only studio track of the album is \\"A Can√ß√£o do Senhor da Guerra\\" (The Song of the Lord of War). Originally, it was simply titled \\"O Senhor da Guerra\\" (The Lord of War) and was featured in an album from A Era dos Halley, a Rede Globo children special aired from November 1985 to May 1986. The band guest starred in one of the episodes, performing the song to the characters and wearing medieval clothes. The album was produced by Guto Gra√ßa Mello and featured performances by Tim Maia, Roupa Nova, Baby Consuelo, Sempre Livre, Rosana and Guilherme Lamounier, Tit√£s, S√©rgio Dias, Tx√£ and Gabriela. This album's version is different, not only in the title, but also in the fact that it was entirely recorded by Russo, who played all instruments over an electronic drum set. A rare interview with Raul Seixas that circulates on the internet suggests that the song had originally been requested to him. He says he had just created a new song with Lena Coutinho and that he would take it to Rio de Janeiro the following day. \\"I will be the 'Lord of War'\\", he said. It's not known why Legi√£o Urbana's version was ultimately chosen over his.

Rode rose to prominence as a trading centre on the ceremonial borders of Wiltshire and Somerset, and later became a market town. The old village was positioned around St Lawrence's church along the main thoroughfare (known as Rode Major; now on the ordnance map as \\"Church Row\\"). However, many parts of the old village were damaged in a fire and the ruins can be seen in the field adjoining the church. Rode's prominence was greatest during the 16th and 17th centuries, when the wool milling industry boomed in the South West; a success due largely to the meandering nature of its rivers, which afforded the space for the construction of mill ponds and streams, and because of its close proximity to the international port of Bristol. At one point Rode was home to four or five wool mills which created great wealth for the village and funded the construction of many large houses in the village, such as Rode Manor, Langham House, Milfield House and Southfield House. During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries the village centre thrived enough for Rode to be known as a market town. Possibly the greatest single moment in the milling industry of Rode was during the 18th century when a consortium of Rode mills won a competition to make Queen Charlotte's dress. In winning the prize a mill in the village invented the dye Royal Blue and received a certificate to sell it under that name. By the middle to the end of the 19th century, the wool mills of Rode were struggling, like many in the South West region, as a result of both the industrial revolution and the invention of steam power, which caused mills to move to northern industrial centres. Rode is now largely a dormitory village, offering good access to Bristol, Bath, Trowbridge and Frome. =The Murder at Road Hill House= Rode was the scene of one of the most infamous murders of the 19th century when Constance Kent was arrested by order of the town magistrates for the murder of her 3-year-old half-brother at Road Hill House (now Langham House). The case was investigated by Detective Inspector Jack Whicher. Although released at her committal hearing, Kent was later to confess, was charged and received the mandatory death sentence. This was commuted to life imprisonment, of which she served twenty years. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls in the 'Rode and Norton St Philip' electoral ward. The ward has its northern edge in Norton St Philip, then it stretches south through Rode to Lullington. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 2,2227. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Church of St Lawrence, Rode Religious sites The Church of St Lawrence dates from the late 14th and early 15th century. It was restored in 1874 by Charles Edward Davis and is a Grade I listed building. There is also a Baptist-Methodist chapel, dating from 1809, which has Grade II listed building status for the gates and walls. Christ Church at Rode Hill was built in 1824 but was declared redundant in 1995 and is now a house and violin shop.

Amenities  Facilities in the village include a village school, pre- school, shop/post office, physiotherapy and acupuncture clinic, chocolate factory, recreation ground and a cricket club, which was founded in about 1895. There used to be several mills in the village, one of which has now been converted into the Mill pub. Other pubs in Rode are the Cross Keys and the Bell. Until 1962, the village was home to Fussell's Brewery, which grew up behind the Cross Keys Inn. It continued to be used as a bottling plant and distribution depot by Bass until 1992. The site was eventually sold off to a housing developer despite strong opposition from residents, as was the site of Rode Tropical Bird Gardens, an animal sanctuary and small zoo, which closed its doors to the public in 2001.

Its location is now occupied by the borough of Santa Severa. Remains of its defensive walls exist in polygonal blocks of limestone and sandstone, neatly jointed. They enclosed a rectangular area some 200 m in width and at least 220 m in length. The south-west extremity has probably been destroyed by the sea. It contained a rich temple of Leucothea, the foundation of which was ascribed to the Pelasgi. It was plundered by Dionysius in 384 BC. Later it became dependent on Caere, though it is not probable that it was originally merely the harbour of Caere; Alsium was c. to the south.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 53,690. History The railway arch bridge across the Msta The Msta River was an important waterway since at least the 10th century, since it connected Novgorod with the basins of the Volga and the Northern Dvina Rivers. The settlement was first mentioned in 1495. It was granted town status in 1770 by Catherine the Great. The main occupation of the town's inhabitants was piloting ships through the rapids of the Msta River that used to be a part of an important waterway connecting Central Russia with the Baltic Sea (hence a rudder appears on the town's coat of arms granted by Catherine the Great). However, by the mid-19th century, after opening of the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway and the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway, the significance of the Msta River as a transport route has decreased. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. In 1773, Borovichsky Uyezd was established. In 1776, the area was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and Borovichsky Uyezd was transferred to Novgorod Governorate. Sources of fire clay were discovered near the town in the 19th century, and the first fire brick manufacturing plant opened in the region in 1855. In 1878, a railway branch connected the town to Uglovka station of the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway, which allowed to establish several large fire brick plants in 1880. Now about half of the town's population is employed in the fire brick industry. In 1905, the first arch bridge in Russia was built in Borovichi across the Msta. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Borovichsky District was established, with the administrative center in Borovichi. The district was a part of Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. The town of Borovichi initially belonged to the district, but from 1930 it was elevated in status to that of a town of oblast significance. On July 5, 1944, Borovichsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Borovichi serves as the administrative center of Borovichsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #559-OZ As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Borovichi‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts (one of the three in Novgorod Oblast). As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Borovichi is incorporated within Borovichsky Municipal District as Borovichi Urban Settlement.Law #369-OZ Economy =Industry= In Borovichi, there are enterprises of construction material production, timber industry, and food industry. There is also production of woodworking machines and of engines. =Transportation= Borovichi railway station Borovichi is connected by a railroad with Uglovka and thus with the railway between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. There are road connections to Tikhvin (via Lyubytino), Okulovka, and Pestovo. Borovichi is a local bus transportation hub. Culture and recreation The Pentecost Church in Borovichi The town of Borovichi contains one cultural heritage monument of federal significance‚Äîthe arch bridge across the Msta‚Äîand additionally ninety- nine objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The town is home to the Borovichi Regional Museum. The famous rapids of the Msta River popular among tourists are located just upstream from Borovichi.

Its MƒÅori name is kahukura, which means \\"red cloak\\". The red admiral is a member of the family Nymphalidae, the subfamily Nymphalinae and the tribe Nymphalini. There are two subspecies: V. g. gonerilla, which occurs on the mainland of New Zealand, and V. g. ida, which occurs on the Chatham Islands. Description The red admiral is a medium-sized butterfly with a 50‚Äì60 mm wingspan. The top side of the forewings is mostly black, with a central bright red bar running back from the front edge. There are white spots, fringed with light blue, near the forewing tips. The rear wings are a dark reddish brown with a red patch containing four black circles; the centre of each circle is pale blue. The underside of the rear wings is a mottled collection of white/brown/black shapes, which camouflages the butterfly when at rest. When revealed, the underside of the forewings display a striking blue eyespot bracketed by white and red arcs. File:NZ Red Admiral (Vanessa gonerilla)-5.jpgFolded camouflaged wings File:NZ Red Admiral 09.JPGEyespot Distribution and threats Red admirals are relatively common throughout New Zealand where their food plants occur. Anecdotal evidence suggest their numbers have been declining since the early 1900s, and the species has reportedly disappeared from Auckland. This is linked to spraying and the decline of native nettle plants, although nettle numbers are also affected by drought; nettle species are now being cultivated by NZ Forest & Bird and some councils as a butterfly food. Another factor in red admiral decline has been exotic parasitic wasps. The Australian white-spotted ichneumon wasp Echthromorpha intricatoria is self introduced, and the pteromalid wasp Pteromalus puparum was introduced by government entomologists in 1932‚Äì33 to control the adventive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae), a serious agricultural pest in New Zealand. One study at Banks Peninsula noted that 1‚Äì19% of red admiral pupae were parasitised by P. puparum, and 20‚Äì30% by E. intricatoria. Life cycle The primary host plant for red admiral larvae is the native stinging nettle, ongaonga (Urtica ferox), although larvae can also eat other Urtica species. Throughout their life they use the nettle leaf to protect them during the day, by rolling the edge around them, or (as they get bigger) folding the leaf over into a 'tent'. thumb The green, barrel-shaped, ribbed eggs are generally laid singly on a leaf. The larva only eats enough of the eggshell to get out, whereas the closely related yellow admiral larva consumes the whole shell. Larvae go through five growth stages (called instars). For about 10 days they have a brown body with small white spots and fine hairs (setae). At about 2.5 mm they moult and during this stage develop a pale stripe along the body just above the legs. The setae start to develop spikes, usually two or more at this stage. At about 5 mm long they moult again and the pale longitudinal lines become more obvious. At about 10 mm they moult once more, and the setae develop more spikes. The last moult is at about 22 mm, from where caterpillars grow to about 36 mm before pupating into a roughly 20‚Äìmm pupa. It is difficult to tell red admiral and yellow admiral caterpillars apart: looking at the 4th and 6th body segments, the yellow admiral larva has a wider light coloured area than the red admiral. The pupa of the red admiral tends to be thinner and longer than that yellow admiral when compared side by side, but otherwise they are very difficult to distinguish.

Adult red admirals occur most frequently during summer. They over- winter as adults, so can be seen on warm winter days. They are long lived, surviving up to six months in the summer, and perhaps nine months for those which overwinter. The adults feed on nectar from various plant species (native and introduced) and occasionally on seepage of sap. They are strong fliers, but their short flights when feeding and ovipositing are very erratic. Flights over water or mountain ranges are straight and fast, characteristic of a migrating butterfly, but no migration within New Zealand has been reported.

McGonigle, a Temple University trustee and pretzel magnate from Reading, Pennsylvania who donated the new facility's furniture and equipment. McGonigle Hall opened on December 2, 1969, with a Temple University men's basketball win over St. John's. The venue served as the home of men's basketball until it was replaced in 1997 by the Liacouras Center. In 2012, the University completed a $48 million renovation and expansion of Pearson and McGonigle Halls, providing additional classrooms, faculty and coaching staff offices as well as state-of- the-art men's and women's basketball practice facilities. Temple Men's Basketball Temple hosts the University of Connecticut at McGonigle Hall on January 28, 2014 The Temple men's basketball program held a practice open to the public at McGonigle Hall on October 15, 1969. The team played three home games that season at McGonigle and the rest of its home schedule at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Temple dedicated the venue on December 2, 1969 before its game against St. John's which was preceded by a Temple freshman game against LaSalle. Due to the venue's small size, Temple would play the majority of its home schedule at the Palestra through 1984. Coach John Chaney and the school decided to move most of its home games to McGonigle Hall to have a home-court advantage and build on campus spirit. Temple reached number one in the national rankings in February 1988. Despite ticket demand, then school president Peter J. Liacouras refused to move the February 10, 1988 game against Villanova to the Spectrum, insisting the game be played at McGonigle on campus. For basketball events such as selected 1987, 1990, and 1992 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball tournament games, its capacity was 4,500. The Temple men's team played its final game at McConigle Hall on February 24, 1997, a 69‚Äì53 win over Fordham. The school welcomed back Harry Litwack for the game, along with the other players from the team's first season at the gym in 1969. Temple played a \\"Turn Back the Clock Game\\" at McGonigle Hall against Bowling Green on December 28, 2009, featuring throwback uniforms and 1980s music, attire, and concession prices. Temple had a record of 178 wins and 29 losses at McGonigle. Community Events The Black Panther Party held its Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention at McGonigle Hall on September 5 and 6, 1970. Huey P. Newton spoke on September 5, 1970 to a crowd of 6,000 with another thousand outside. President Jimmy Carter held a \\"Philadelphia town hall\\" meeting before an audience of 1,100 at McGonigle Hall on November 13, 1979. The president's helicopter landed at Geasy Field, 15th and Berks Street. McConigle Hall has served as a concert venue on multiple occasions. Soul Asylum played the venue on April 17, 1997; H√ºsker D√º and Christmas on March 22, 1987; and Kris Kristofferson played on August 18, 1976. NBC Sports Network held a \\"Fight Night\\" boxing event at McGonigle Hall on December 8, 2012 that featured Philadelphia native heavyweight Bryant Jennings. Following the 2016 Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine held a campaign rally on July 29, 2016 at McGonigle Hall.

He also appeared in the Southern League for Ipswich Town and Colchester United. Career Born in Wolverhampton, Astill played as a youth for Horden Road and Old Hall schools in Wolverhampton, before joining local club Heath Town, and then being picked up by hometown Football League club Wolverhampton Wanderers. After only two appearances for Wolves, he moved to Blackburn Rovers in 1935 having gained England Junior caps during the 1934‚Äì35 season. He signed for a fee of ¬£3,000, but could only manage three appearances and one goal at Ewood Park. Astill moved to East Anglia from Blackburn to Ipswich Town in 1937, where he scored 12 goals in 27 league games during his solitary season at the club. For Astill to remain at Portman Road, Ipswich needed to stump up a ¬£1,000 fee for his signing, but the club refused despite the player being second-top scorer for the 1937‚Äì38 season, and so moved on to neighbours Colchester United. The move to Colchester proved fruitful for Astill as he helped the club secure the Southern League title in his first season. After his debut on 27 August 1938 in a 2‚Äì0 win over Gillingham and scoring his first goal against Yeovil & Petters United in an 8‚Äì1 thrashing on 10 September, Astill ended his first season with 13 goals in 27 league appearances, but his time at the club was cut short with the outbreak of World War II and the cancellation of the 1939‚Äì40 season, where he appeared in all three matches before the competition was abandoned. Personal life The War spelt the end of Astill's playing career, and he became an on-course bookmaker in Telford, before becoming a newsagent and then settling in Walsall working as a market trader for almost 30 years.

Bush, on Tuesday, January 31, 2006, at 9 p.m. EST, in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives to the 109th United States Congress. It was Bush's fifth State of the Union Address and his sixth speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, accompanied by Dick Cheney, the Vice President of the United States. The address outlined the President's legislative proposals for the upcoming year and referenced the budget deficit, health care reform, the War on Terror, the Occupation of Iraq, Iran's nuclear program, the rising price of gasoline and the transfer to independent sources of alternative energy, illegal immigration, Hurricane Katrina and the federal response to natural disasters, Avian influenza (H5N1) outbreak, the Abramoff scandal and corruption within the government, the NSA spying controversy, the successful nomination of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, and the Administration's proposed ban on same-sex marriage. Newly elected Governor of Virginia Tim Kaine gave the Democratic response in English and Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa did so in Spanish. Introduction President Bush began his State of the Union Address for the year by reflecting on the memory of Coretta Scott King, who died earlier that day, and Martin Luther King, Jr., \\"the husband who was taken so long ago\\".State of the Union 2006, from the White House website Bush then paralleled \\"moments of national mourning,\\" an indirect reference to the September 11, 2001 attacks with \\"national achievement.\\" When discussing the American political system, Bush used anaphora, repeating \\"two\\" at the beginning of each clause, \\"two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches.\\" Bush shifted his tense from the past to the future while emphasizing the need for civility and bipartisanship among legislators during debate. Echoing his 2005 State of the Union address, he stated \\"Tonight the state of our Union is strong ‚Äì and together we will make it stronger.\\" Terrorism and isolationism He again used anaphora by repeating \\"We will choose,\\" paralleling \\"pursuing the enemies of freedom,\\" applicable to both the Axis of Evil and terrorists in general, with \\"Retreating \\"from our duties in the hope of an easier life,\\" a direct attack on Criticism of the Iraq War, which particularly calls for withdrawal. He paralleled choosing \\"to build our prosperity by leading the world economy\\" with the alternative \\"shut[ting] ourselves off from trade and opportunity,\\" a warning against protectionism and isolationism. The President cited a foiled terror plot in Los Angeles, where terrorists supposedly planned to hijack a plane and fly it into the Liberty Tower. Democracy versus tyranny Bush stated that America's involvement in Afghanistan is a necessity, part of an overall historical goal of trying to end tyranny worldwide, because \\"problems originating in a failed and oppressive state seven thousand miles away\\" orchestrated the September 11th attacks and continue to \\"shelter terrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction\\" whereas Democracies give hope and \\"respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors.\\" The president pointed out that there are 98 more Democratic countries in 2006 than there were in 1945, in addition to Women's suffrage in Afghanistan, the Purple Revolution in Iraq, and political discourse in Lebanon and Egypt, as evidence that Democracy, freedom, and self-governance have grown throughout the world. Although many social and political analysts would agree that more people live in free and fair societies than at the end of World War II, all of the examples Bush provided lay in the Middle East. He went on to say that the \\"demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require... freedom\\" for the citizens of nations in the Axis of Evil; Syria, Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran. Radical Islam Shifting away from the comparison of democracy and dictatorship during the Cold War and post-9/11 America, Bush outlined the major opposition to freedom as radical Islam, which he defines as \\"the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.\\" See also: Religion of Peace He stressed that \\"bin Laden [is] serious about mass murder\\" and wants to \\"impose... totalitarian control throughout the Middle East, and arm [al Qaeda] with weapons of mass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven... When they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will.\\" He indirectly referenced the Beatitudes by saying the terrorists hope that breaking the will of the U.S. will allow \\"the violent to inherit the Earth.\\" Retreat from evil In a verbal attack on \\"isolationist\\" and \\"appeasing\\" sentiments, Bush condemned \\"the false comfort of isolationism\\" for sending the \\"signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage.\\" Energy Bush stated that America is addicted to oil often originating from unstable parts of the world. He announced increased funding in clean-energy research: renewable energy, for instance biofuels and nuclear energy. He also stated the goal of 75% oil import replacement by 2025 based on new technologies.

Although a completely standalone game in its own right, Hordes was designed as a companion to Warmachine, Privateer Press' flagship miniatures game. The games are 100% compatible, and share much of the same rules set, although the most important mechanic - fury for Hordes and focus for Warmachine - remains unique to each. Hordes forces and Warmachine forces often face off against each other both on the tabletop and in the background fiction. The games share the same setting, the Iron Kingdoms, with much of the Hordes storyline taking place in the wild areas away from the 'civilized' areas where Warmachines major action takes place. Hordes won the 2006 Origins Award for Miniatures Game or Expansion of the Year.  Gameplay  As in Warmachine, gameplay in Hordes is supposed to promote offensive play; defensive play is possible, but the spirit of the game (as laid out in Page 5 of Primal) encourages \\"testosterone-laden aggression\\".Hordes: Primal, Privateer Press, 2006 Play is centered on Warlocks and their attendant Warbeasts, who may be supported by units and solos. Warbeasts generate fury(an equivalent to focus which is allocated or not at the start of your turn), which can be controlled by Warlocks and used to fuel their spells, but if left unchecked can cause the beasts to go into an uncontrolled frenzy, potentially even attacking their allies or controlling warlock. Hordes is similar to Warmachine in most aspects; if you already know how to play Warmachine then you already know the basics of Hordes. The core mechanic is the same as its companion game Warmachine: roll two six-sided dice, add one stat, and compare the total to an opposing stat. Additionally, almost all rules mechanics from Warmachine are replicated in Hordes. Together, the two rules sets form a single rules superset, which consists mostly of rules common to both games, and partially of mechanics specific to one game or the other. The game-specific mechanics are generally those used by warlocks and warbeasts for Hordes, and warcasters and warjacks for Warmachine, while those rules covering generally how models move, act, and how their actions are resolved are common to both. Replacing the Warcaster as the commander of the army is a Warlock, a powerful magic-user who draws upon the collective Fury of his warbeasts to cast spells and heal damage. As the four factions in Hordes use no steamjacks, their functional parallel are Warbeasts, large savage creatures. The Warlock is able to \\"force\\" Warbeasts to perform special attacks, which builds up Fury points. The Warlock is then able to \\"leach\\" this Fury to add to his pool, otherwise the warbeast will continue to gather Fury, eventually losing control and going into an uncontrollable rage. This system has been dubbed \\"Risk Management\\" as opposed to the \\"Resource Management\\" system in Warmachine. The first rule book for the Hordes system is called Primal. It contains all the latest rules for the Hordes (and Warmachine) system, and army lists for the four 'factions' along with some Minions who will work for various armies. An expansion for the game called Evolution was released by Privateer Press in August 2007. A third expansion, Metamorphosis, was released in 2009. In 2010 a major rules revision, called MkII, was released following a similar revision for Warmachine. The current main rule book is called Primal MkII. It contained the latest rules and stats for a subset of the released figures for each faction. After this five Forces of Hordes books were released, one for each main faction and one for the Minions, each one containing stats for all released models for that faction and some new units. MkII saw its first expansion in December 2011 when the book Domination was released. In December 2016, Forces of HORDES: Trollbloods Command was released and featured all the current faction and profile rules for Trollblood models in Hordes Mk II. In addition, the rulebook also contained new troops to add to the fray, including an all-new Warlock. The sourcebook also contained an in-depth look at the history and structure of trollkin kriels. = Hordes/Warmachine interaction = From the beginning, Hordes was designed to be played against Warmachine. Playing a Warmachine army against a Hordes army is little different from playing two Hordes armies or two Warmachine armies against each other, and many of the special rules are written so that they affect models from both games in similar ways. As an example, damage is recorded differently for warbeasts (in branches) and warjacks (in columns), but most effects which let you choose a column to record damage against a warjack also let you choose a branch, and vice versa. However, each game does have models which possess special rules which are not effective against models from the other game.  Factions  Six factions native to the Iron Kingdoms make up the armies of Hordes: = Trollbloods = A collection of various troll breeds, banding together to push back both the civilized nations of Immoren and the forces of the wild from their territories. Trollkin and the Pygmy Trolls (their diminutive counterparts) comprise the more intelligent, civilized troll breeds and fill the role of basic troops in a troll army, while the larger, stronger, and more savage cousins, the full-blood trolls, are used as light warbeasts. Full-blood trolls can be grouped into two general categories, those who use hand-held weapons and those who rely on their own unique physiology. The Troll Axer, Impaler, and Bouncer fall into the former category, specializing in melee, ranged, and defensive roles respectively, while the Pyre, Winter, and Slag Trolls can add fire, cold, and corrosion effects to either their melee or ranged attacks, making both groups fairly versatile to field. Rarer and much more dangerous than either trollkin or full-blood trolls are the Dire Trolls, giant full- blooded troll beasts that dwarf even other full-blood trolls whose ravenous and seemingly endless appetites frighten man, beast, and trollkin alike. These monsters are exclusively used as heavy warbeasts and include the Dire Troll Mauler, Blitzer, and Earthborn, which is also the Trollkin's Alpha Warbeast. Finally the advent of Metamorphosis saw the addition of \\"Mulg the Ancient\\" to the Trollkin's ranks, the oldest and most powerful of Dire Trolls. Matt Wilson of Privateer Press has stated the Trollbloods will be the 'protagonist' faction of Hordes. In play they are extremely tough and resilient, very strong melee fighters and have great synergy between various units and their Warlocks. To compensate for their strength and resilience the Trolls are largely regarded as the second slowest of the four factions, but with their staying power and strength of arms they can endure punishment that would shatter other factions' defenses. = Circle Orboros = A secret cabal of powerful druids, cultists, and wilderness tribes that command the forces of nature against their foes. Led by the Omnipotents, a trio of master druids and spellcasters, the druids follow three primary paths of elemental power: Beast, Storm, and Stone, and each of the three warlocks introduced in \\"Hordes: Primal\\" exemplify one of these paths. While the druids are the largely undisputed masters of the Circle they have allied themselves with the Tharn, a race of human cannibals dedicated to the worship of the Devourer Wurm, one of the aspects of the druids' god, Orboros. The druids' magical power is easily matched by physical prowess of the Tharn, who are able to call upon the Devourer Wurm to warp their bodies into amalgamations of beast and man before throwing themselves against their enemies. These two groups comprise the bulk of a Circle army's troop choices. Finally the Circle uses both the beasts of the wild and elemental constructs called wolds as their warbeasts. With a penchant for wolves the Circle employs the two-headed Argus and bipedal Gorax as their living light warbeast choices, with the Woldwatcher and Woldwyrd representing the elemental constructs. Their heavy warbeasts include the Gnarlhorn and Shadowhorn Satyrs, the Feral Warpwolf and Pureblood Warpwolf, the Woldwarden, and Megalith, a unique woldwarden constructed by one of the warlocks from Primal. The Circle's play style is typically fast and furious, using existing terrain against their opponents and often creating terrain of their own while their beasts and units use both their high speed and various teleportation abilities (a trait fairly unusual of the Circle) to get where they need to be when needed. Whether spellcaster or melee unit all Circle troops can move across any terrain without penalty. As agile as they are, however, the Circle does not have the armor or tenacity to stand long in a straight up, prolonged fight. In general a Circle army must hit hard and either destroy their target, or retreat to avoid any serious counterattack. = Skorne = A warlike, savage humanoid race invading from beyond the Bloodstone Marches. Built on a philosophy of pain they have turned the act of torture into an art form, documenting in exacting detail their own physiology as well as those of the various beasts that they have encountered and enslaved in their homeland. Organized into castes and split into various warring houses, Skorne society is built upon the backs of countless slaves, both humanoid and animal. A very organized, militaristic faction, their troops are highly regimented and disciplined, focusing primarily on melee combat with relatively few ranged choices. Like the Circle they employ a variety of species of warbeasts, with the versatile Cyclops Savage, Brute, and Shaman filling melee offense, defense, and magical roles respectively while the Basilisk Drake and Krea fill ranged and support roles. As for heavies the Skorne, like the Trolls, specialize in melee combat: the Titan Gladiator, Titan Bronzeback, Rhinodon, and Molik Karn (their unique warbeast introduced in Metamorphosis) all excel in both damage output and resilience, with the Titan Cannoneer filling both melee and ranged roles. A Skorne army plays similar to a Troll army, with a few notable differences. Arguably the slowest of the Hordes factions, the Skorne excel at regimented, brick-style combat, with hardened melee troops and beasts forming a wall in front with ranged and support units behind, but whereas the trolls specialize in defense and endurance, the Skorne specialize in offense and damage output, even at the expense of their own troops and beasts. Most notably the Skorne have access to several abilities that can turn their losses into advantages, more than any other Hordes faction, giving them an edge in battles of attrition. Several army additions released in Hordes: Evolution and Metamorphosis drastically changed the original Primal Skorne play-style, allowing them to field more varied types of armies, but the tried-and-true Skorne brick is still a powerhouse to contend with, for few factions can deal out more damage than the Skorne in straight-up melee combat. = Legion of Everblight = An army of draconic horrors and twisted creatures who serve the newly reawakened (but not reformed) dragon, Everblight, the Legion is led by the blighted ogrun Thagrosh, Prophet and now Messiah of Everblight, who discovered the resting place of Everblight's crystal heart, or athanc, thrust it into his own chest, and thus unleashed the Legion into the world. All of the Legion Warlocks carry a shard of the athanc within themselves, linking themselves both to the mind of Everblight as well as each other. The energy emanating from the athanc shards, called blight, has both corrupting and mutational properties, which can be used to warp and twist others to the will of Everblight. The first victims of this influence were the Nyss, the arctic race of elves which lived near the mountain where Everblight's athanc was discovered by Thagrosh, and these blighted Nyss comprise the bulk of a Legion's unit and troop choices. Apart from the Nyss several tribes of ogrun have been subjected to the blight as well, giving the Legion limited heavy troop options. The warbeasts of the Legion are all dragonspawn, hideous eyeless draconic creatures created from the blood of Everblight's warlocks. Two hallmarks of the Legion are the inclusion of lesser warbeasts, a third category of beasts apart from lights and heavies, and the inclusion of warbeasts with wings, making them highly maneuverable. The three lessers to date, the Shredder, Stinger and winged Harrier, serve primarily as expendable shock troops or damage sinks. Their light beasts are more diverse, with the Teraph and Nephilim Protector filling defensive roles, the Nephilim Soldier and Raek providing melee offense options. The Nephilim Bolt Thrower provides ranged support. The Legion also has access to a number of heavy warbeasts. The Carnivean and Scythean focus on melee damage while the winged Angelius is a fast, maneuverable assassin. Additionally, the Ravagore provides a balance of melee power and artillery- like support with its fiery breath, and the winged Seraph specializes in ranged combat and maneuverability. Typhon, the Legion's unique warbeast introduced in Metamorphosis, was at the time the only Legion warbeast capable of throwing its victims, a previously unheard of ability among Legion beasts. This changed with the release of Hordes Mk.II, which presented updated rules that gave the Carnivean and Ravagore the ability to grab and throw as well. The Legion play style is similar to the Circle, fast and maneuverable but not very durable. The primary differences are that whereas the Circle relies on synergy between their units, beasts, and warlocks to get the job done, each element of a Legion army is designed to function independently, with each element working alone but in sync with the others to get the job done. Finally while the Circle has a definite focus on magical attacks, the Legion is predominantly focused on fast, hard-hitting alpha strikes. = Grymkin = The Grymkin are the denizens of the wilderness of Urcaen beyond the protection of the gods - essentially hell for all intents and purposes. Grymkin are not undead, or demons, but have both souls and physical bodies. The warbeasts are the nightmares of the Defiers given flesh and blood. For millennia they tormented the defiers before they learned to control them. The lesser Grymkin are those wicked souls who end up in the wilds of Urcaen and are judged and transformed by the Defiers as an eternal punishment. The Defiers themselves are five humans who were banished to the wilds of Urcaen for refusing Menoth's law. Their wills were so strong that they each became demigods dedicated to opposing Menoth and punishing his creation, which they see as corrupt and wicked. For centuries, the Defiers awaited their chance to return to Caen to unleash their wicked harvest on Menoth's civilization. It was not until the Old Witch devised a way to create a portal to Urcaen through which the armies of the grymkin could pass that they got their chance. The Old Witch's motive for unleashing hell on earth was‚Äîoddly enough‚Äîto use the Grymkin to slow the spread of infernalism that would one day unleash an even worse hell on earth if left unchecked. If Infernals ever invaded Caen in full force, it would mean the end of the world and the eternal torment of all living souls. The Grymkin, then, are the world's twisted salvation from annihilation. The Grymkin playstyle is based around punishing the opponent for taking certain actions and has a heavy emphasis on reaping corpses to power their abilities. They are melee-centric and have the worst ranged abilities of any faction. Even Minions out shoot them. =Minions= Occasionally other creatures in the wilds of western Immoren are caught up in the conflicts of the region. Some are individuals seeking profit. Others are small groups of tribal creatures willing to offer their strength of arms to others, whether in return for protection or supplies or to preserve their home territories from enemies. Events can sweep up these minor players against their will as they are captured, enslaved, or coerced into doing the bidding of the factions that are more numerous or powerful. Whatever their concerns or motivations, minions bring versatility to their sponsors. Swamp gobbers bring the inventive alchemy of their fog bellows to cloak allies in concealing mist. Farrow brigands offer rifles and clubs for hire and willing to take the brunt of enemy assaults. Gatormen are among the most vicious and deadly warriors in the region, with a combination of physical prowess and tough scaled hides. Bog trogs emerge from the wetlands wielding barbed hooks and take advantage of their natural camouflage to ambush and surprise the enemy.

The village is referred to colloquially as KO. St Oswald's Church, Kirkoswald, looking south-west Heritage The village's name means Church of St Oswald and the parish church is dedicated to Saint Oswald, King of Northumbria. The body of Oswald is believed to have been taken through the village. The church lies on the southern edge of the village overlooking the River Eden close to the bridge which connects Kirkoswald to Lazonby. St Oswald's Church is unique in having a 19th-century bell tower on top of the hill 200 yards from the church itself. Parts of the church date from the 12th century, the chancel being added in 1523, when the \\"College\\" was founded by Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre and his wife.Kirkoswald - St Oswald's Church Church A sacred spring lies under the nave of the church, and a well is found on the west wall.Kirkoswald Cumbria One of Kirkoswald's most splendid buildings is the College, its name recalling the days when St Oswald's Church was a collegiate church. Originally built in 1450 as a Pele Tower it became home to the Fetherstonhaugh family, after dissolution in 1547, who previously lived at Featherstone Castle in Northumberland. Amenities The village consists mainly of one main street rising up a steep hill passing through a former market place on which the village's two pubs (the Crown Inn and the Fetherston Arms) are situated. A third pub, the Black Bull, which at one time won awards for its food, overlooked the square, but this closed in the early 1990s. The village also has one shop which houses a post office, a Methodist church and a well- attended primary school. Until recently there were further shops, including a butcher and a branch of the Midland Bank.

The professional side was either the Football League champion or FA Cup winner from the previous season while the amateurs were usually represented by Corinthian, a renowned amateur side of the time. The first game was played on 19 March 1898, after being devised by Sir Thomas Dewar and ratified by the Football Association, whose president Lord Kinnaird and former president Sir Francis Marindin sat on the Shield's committee. Proceeds from the annual game were distributed to hospitals and charities. The game was the predecessor to the FA Charity Shield, today the FA Community Shield, which began in 1908 after the Amateur Football Association split from the Football Association. After 1908 the trophy was revived on seven occasions in the twentieth century to raise funds for grassroots football causes in matches played between London-based sides. History =Formation= Lord Dewar The Corinthian team of 1896‚Äì97, including Shield committee members: Charles Wreford Brown (far left, seated), N.L. Jackson (centre, seated) and R.C. Gosling (2nd left, seated) In 1898 a shield was offered by Sir Thomas Dewar, the Sheriff of London at the time, with the understanding that it would pit the best professional side and amateur side against each other with proceeds going to charity. A high profile committee of Football Association and amateur football representatives, politicians and England players past and present was formed composed of Sir Dewar; Lord Kinnaird (President of the FA); Sir Reginald Hanson (Lord Mayor of London); Sir Francis Marindin (Former President of the FA); Sir William Bromley-Davenport (Member of Parliament and former England international footballer); Colonel Harry McCalmont (Member of Parliament), R. Cunliffe Gosling (former England captain), Dr. Kemp (a former player for the London-based United Hospitals side), N. L. Jackson (FA Honorary Secretary and Founder of Corinthian), John Bentley (President of the Football League), and Charles Wreford-Brown (former England captain and FA Council member). The competition lasted for nine years in its first incarnation, coming to an end in part due to the dominance of the professional sides, and also to a rift in the Football Association that saw the creation of the Amateur Football Association. Following the 1907 edition, won by Newcastle United, the shield was replaced in 1908 by the FA Charity Shield which rather than the best amateur side pitted the Football League winner against the winners of the Southern Football League and then later against the winner of the FA Cup. =Legacy= The match was later resurrected in the 1930s over four years at the suggestion of Charles Wreford-Brown, a member of the original Shield committee, to raise funds for the National Playing Fields Association. The trophy was again competed for in the 1960s for three years with funds supporting Corinthians Casuals Football Club, the successor to the original Corinthian side. The most recent match for the shield trophy was a one-off game played between Watford and Corinthian Casuals in 1983, marking the centenary of Corinthians original formation. Watford ran out as 6‚Äì1 winners. All seven matches in the post-1907 era were London-only affairs. The shield itself, commissioned by Dewar, was over six feet high and believed to be the largest trophy to be competed for in the history of football. In the 1990s, the trophy was put up for auction by Corinthian Casuals to finance all- weather training facilities; it sold for around ¬£25,000 to a private owner.

If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that b/a is an integer.The Free Dictionary by FarlexDictionary.com UnabridgedCambridge Dictionary Online In mathematics, when a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a, then a is called a divisor of b. One says also that a divides b. If a and b are not integers, mathematicians prefer generally to use integer multiple instead of multiple, for clarification. In fact, multiple is used for other kinds of product; for example, a polynomial p is a multiple of another polynomial q if there exists third polynomial r such that p = qr. In some texts, \\"a is a submultiple of b\\" has the meaning of \\"b being an integer multiple of a\\". This terminology is also used with units of measurement (for example by the BIPM and NIST), where a submultiple of a main unit is a unit, named by prefixing the main unit, defined as the quotient of the main unit by an integer, mostly a power of 103. For example, a millimetre is the 1000-fold submultiple of a metre.

Kurmanji literature  A Yezidi religious work, the Meshefa Re≈ü, is in a classic form of Kurmanji and it has been conjectued that it was written sometime in the 13th century. However, it has been argued that the work was actually written as late as the 20th century by non-Yazidi authors seeking to summarise the beliefs of Yezidis in a form similar to that of the holy scriptures of other religions. * Serencam, The book of Yarsan. The Kurdish poet Muhammad Faqi Tayran (1590‚Äì1660) collected many folk stories in his book In the Words of the Black Horse. He also wrote a book of Sufi verse, The Story of Shaykh of San‚Äô√¢n. Faqi-Tayran also had versified correspondence with the poet Malaye Jaziri. Some of the well-known Kurmanji poets and writers are listed below. #Ali Hariri (1009-1079). #Mela Hesen√™ Batey√Æ (1417‚Äì1494) from Hakkari region, who wrote the author of Mawlud, a collection of verse and an anthology; #Salim Salman, author of Y√ªsif √ª Zuleyxa in 1586; #Malaye Jaziri (1570‚Äì1640) from Buhtan region, the famous sufi poet. His collection of poems contains more than 2,000 verses #Ahmad Khani (1651‚Äì1707), the author of Mam and Zin, a long poem of 2,650 distichs, is probably the best known and most popular of the classical Kurdish poets. #Ismail Bayazidi (1654‚Äì1710), author of a Kurmanji-Arabic-Persian dictionary for children, entitled Guljen. =The tragedy of Mam and Zin= The drama of Mem √ª Z√Æn (Mam and Zin) (Mem√Æ Alan √ª Z√Æn√Æ Buhtan), was written in 1694 by Ahmad Khani (1651‚Äì1707) from Hakkari, is a rich source of Kurdish culture, history and mythology. This work also emphasizes the national aspirations of the Kurdish people. Mam of the Alan clan and Zin of Buhtan family are two lovers from Alan and Butan families, respectively. Their union is blocked by a person named Bakr of the Bakran clan. Mam eventually dies during a complicated conspiracy by Bakr. When Zin receives the news, she also dies while mourning the death of Mam on his grave. The immense grief leads to her death and she is buried next to Mam. The news of the death of Mam and Zin, spreads quickly among the people of Jazira Butan. Then Bakr's role in the tragedy is revealed, and he takes sanctuary between the two graves. He is eventually captured and slain by the people of Jazira. A thorn bush soon grows out of Bakr's blood, sending its roots of malice deep into the earth between the lovers‚Äô graves, separating the two even after their death. =Contemporary Kurmanji literature= The first Kurmanji newspaper, titled Kurdistan, was published in Cairo in 1898. The Kurds in the Soviet Union, despite their small numbers, had the opportunity of elementary and university education in Kurdish and for many decades. This in turn led to an appearance of several Kurdish writers and researchers among them. The literary works of Qanate Kurdo and Arab Shamilov are the well known examples of Kurdish prose in the 20th century. The first modern Latin-based alphabet for Kurdish was created by Jaladat Ali Badirkhan, the poet and writer who fled Turkey in the 1920s and spent the rest of his life in Syria. Since the 1970s, there has been a massive effort on the part of Kurds in Turkey to write and to create literary works in Kurdish. The amount of printed material during the last three decades has increased enormously. Many of these activities were centered in Europe particularly Sweden and Germany where many of the immigrant Kurds are living. There are a number of Kurdish publishers in Sweden, partly supported by the Swedish Government. More than two hundred Kurdish titles have appeared in the 1990s. Some of the well known contemporary Kurdish writers from Turkey are Firat Cewer√Æ, Mehmed Uzun, Abdusamet Yigit, Mehmed Emin Bozarslan, Mahmud Baksi, Hesen√™ Met√™, Yekta Uzunoglu (Geylani), Arjen Ar√Æ and Rojen Barnas. The main academic center for Kurdish literature and language in Europe is the Kurdish Institute of Paris (Institut Kurde de Paris) founded in 1983. A large number of Kurdish intellectuals and writers from Europe, America and Australia are contributing to the efforts carried out by the Institute for reviving Kurdish language and literature.  Sorani literature  A manuscript of Ahmadi dictionary by Shex Marof Nod√™ (1753-1838) from the archive of legacy committee of Vejin. This manuscript is written in 1928. In contrast to Kurmanji, literary works in Sorani were not abundant before the late 18th century and early 19th century. Although many poets Nal√Æ have written in Sorani,Khazanedar, Maroof (2002), The history of Kurdish literature, Aras, Erbil. but it was only after him that Sorani became an important dialect in writing.Sajjadi Ala'edin (1951), The history of Kurdish literature, Ma'aref, Baghdad. Nal√Æ was the first poet to write a diwan in this dialect. Others, such as Salim and Kurdi, wrote in Sorani in the early 19th century as well. Haji Qadir Koyi of Koy Sanjaq in central Kurdistan (1817‚Äì1897), and Sheikh Reza Talabani (1835‚Äì1909) also wrote in Sorani dialect after Nal√Æ. The closeness of the two dialects of Sorani and Kurmanji is cited as one of the reasons for the late start in Sorani literature, as well as the fact that during 15th to 19th century, there was a rich literary tradition in the Kurmanji dialect. Furthermore the presence of the Gorani dialect as a literary language and its connection to Yarsanism and Ardalan dynasty was another reason that people did not produce texts in Sorani. Despite its late start, Sorani literature progressed with a rapid pace, especially during the early 20th century and after recognition of Sorani as the main language of Kurds in Iraq. The language rights of Kurds were guaranteed by the British and school education in Kurdish started in earnest in the early 1920s. It is estimated that almost 80% of the existing Kurdish literature in the 20th century has been written in Sorani dialect. Increased contact with the Arab world and subsequently western world led to a translation movement among Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan in the early 20th century. Many classical literary works of Europe were translated into Sorani, including the works of Pushkin, Schiller, Byron and Lamartine. Kurdish is one of the official languages of Iraq and the central government assistance has been instrumental in supporting publication of books and magazines in Kurdish. In the 1970s, an organization called Kor√Æ Zaniyar√Æ Kurd (the Kurdish Science Council) was established for academic studies in Kurdish language and literature. It was centered in Baghdad. Kurdish language departments were also opened in some Iraqi universities including Baghdad University, University of Salahaddin and University of Sulaimani. Well-known Sorani poets include Abdulla Goran (founder of the free verse poetry in Kurdish), Sherko Bekas, Abdulla Pashew, Qanih. Many Kurdish writers have written novels, plays and literary analysis including Piramerd, Alaaddin Sajadi, Bakhtyar Ali, Ibrahim Ahmad, Karim Hisami and Hejar.

Bias in school textbooks The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term \\"whitewashing\\" is the one commonly used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment. The reporting of military atrocities in history is extremely controversial, as in the case of the Holocaust (or Holocaust denial) and the Winter Soldier Investigation of the Vietnam War. The representation of every society's flaws or misconduct is typically downplayed in favor of a more nationalist or patriotic view. Also, Christians and other religionists have at times attempted to block the teaching of the theory of evolution in schools, as evolutionary theory appears to contradict their religious beliefs; the teaching of creationism as a science is likewise blocked from many public schools. In the context of secondary-school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One legitimate argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the \\"inappropriate\\" distinction is in itself controversial, as it can be used to enforce wider and more politically motivated censorship. Religious bias Many countries and states have guidelines against bias in education, but they are not always implemented. The guidelines of the California Department of Education (Code 60044) state the following: \\"No religious belief or practice may be held up to ridicule and no religious group may be portrayed as inferior.\\" \\"Any explanation or description of a religious belief or practice should be present in a manner that does not encourage or discourage belief or indoctrinate the student in any particular religious belief.\\"California State Law, Education Code 60044, Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content, 2000 Edition . Retrieved on 15 June 2008 On the basis of these guidelines, the Board of Education of California corrected in 2005 misrepresentations of Judaism, Islam and Hinduism in schoolbooks. Many of these misrepresentations were described as biased, erroneous or culturally derogatory. All 500 changes proposed by Jews and about 100 changes proposed by Muslims were accepted.  Gender bias  According to fourth edition of annual Global Education Monitoring Report of UNESCO, 2020, depiction of female characters are less frequest and often discriminatory in school text books of many countries. By country or region = Australia = A recent study of student evaluations of teaching (SET) from a large public university in Sydney focused on gender and cultural bias. The dataset of more than 523,000 individual student surveys across 5 different faculties spanned a seven year period 2010-2016. There were 2,392 unique courses and 3,123 individual teachers in the dataset. The researchers concluded, \\"We detected statistically significant bias against women and staff with non-English language backgrounds, although these effects do not appear in every faculty. Our findings on the effect of cultural background is novel and significant because in Australia, where the population is culturally diverse, current policy and administrative actions have focussed on addressing gender bias, but less on cultural or racial bias. We found some evidence that the proportion of women or staff with non-English language backgrounds in a faculty may be negatively correlated with bias, i.e., having a diverse teaching staff population may reduce bias. We also found that due to the magnitude of these potential biases, the SET scores are likely to be flawed as a measure of teaching performance. Finally, we found no evidence that student‚Äôs unconscious bias changes with the level of their degree program.\\" =United States= Many recent allegations against the United States have surfaced about the hiding of many historical facts from the public through public education and thus luring the public to believing that the actions taken by the U.S. government are justified and provide a global benefit. On the political left, professors Howard Zinn and James Loewen allege that United States history as presented in school textbooks has a conservative bias. A People's History of the United States, by American historian and political scientist Zinn, seeks to present American history through the eyes of groups rarely heard in mainstream histories. Loewen spent two years at the Smithsonian Institution studying and comparing twelve American history textbooks widely used throughout the United States. His findings were published in Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your High School History Textbook Got Wrong. On the political right, professor Larry Schweikart makes the opposite case: he alleges in his 48 Liberal Lies About American History that United States history education has a liberal bias. In a landmark book called \\"The Trouble with Textbooks,\\" Dr. Gary A. Tobin and Dennis R. Ybarra show how some American textbooks contain anti- Semitic versions of Jewish history and faith, particularly in relation to Christianity and Islam. The authors found that some U.S. textbooks \\"tend to discredit the ties between Jews and the Land of Israel. Israel is blamed for starting wars in the region and being colonialist. Jews are charged with deicide in the killing of Jesus. All in all, there are repeated misrepresentations that cross the line into bigotry.\\"  Zero Tolerance policies and Racial Bias  In 2008, The American Psychological Association Zero Tolerance Task Force conducted a study to determine if zero tolerance policies were effective in achieving their goals.American Psychological Association Zero Tolerance Task Force (2008). Are zero tolerance policies effective in the schools? American Psychologist, 63(9), 852‚Äì862. https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.63.9.852 The task force conducted an evidentiary review study which summarized the key findings from twenty years of literature review since the implementation of zero tolerance policies. In addition, the task force also conducted a review of an extensive national database on school discipline. Zero tolerance policies were first introduced to schools in the 1990s to enforce strict disciplinary actions against drug usage. The idea behind zero tolerance policies was that by removing students who participated in those misbehaviors, schools were removing the threat of students further promoting those misbehaviors; thus, allowing for a safer school environment. Schools across the nation began to implement zero- tolerance policies which resulted in predetermined and often severe consequences for students. Schools implemented strict policies without taking into account the context of the situation that led to the disciplinary action. Schools' zero tolerance policies lacked clarity and definition which has led to the misuse of zero tolerance policies. For example, schools enforcing harsh disciplinary consequences for actions that do not endanger school safety. One example the study found was a student who was expelled for using a cell phone to talk to his mom who was overseas. This along with other examples demonstrated that there was a gray area in zero tolerance policy which many times left the interpretation to school administrators and teachers. In theory, zero tolerance policy is a fair practice because it adopts a universal disciplinary policy for all students. However, research shows that there is an overrepresentation of African American students in zero tolerance cases such as suspensions and expulsions. The U.S. Department of Education collected data which further showed that African American students were more than twice as likely to have a zero tolerance violation than their white classmates in corporal punishment, out of school suspension, and expulsion. Research shows that the disproportionate number of African American students being expelled and suspended through zero tolerance policy is not due to an increase in misbehavior but is due to an increase in zero tolerance policy enforcement.Berlowitz, M.J., Frye, R., & Jette, K. (2017). Bullying and Zero- Tolerance Policies: The School to Prison Piepline. Multicultural Learning and Teaching, 12(1), 7-25. https://doi.org/10.515/mlt-2014-0004 Townsend (2000) argues that racial stereotypes and lack of cultural competency of teachers plays a role in interactions between teachers and African American students. In a study with students from an urban high school, Sheets (1996) noted that students of color viewed disciplinary actions from teachers as intentional. Students also argued that teachers used subjective reasons for example ‚Äúlack of respect‚Äù to enforce zero tolerance policies and remove students from the classroom. Schools misuse of zero tolerance policies has also led to the criminalization of students of color and has resulted in high suspension and expulsion rates. This push out from schools leads students of color into the criminal justice system in a phenomenon called the school to prison pipeline. Heitzeg (2009) refers to the school to prison pipeline as the growing pattern of students who are pushed out of schools as a result of zero tolerance policies who are then introduced to the criminal justice system. Studies show that African American males are more likely to drop out of schools due to disciplinary reasons. According to the Office of Education Ombudsan in Washington state, 33% of the students who dropped out of high school during the 2011-2012 school year were African American. Heitzeg (2009) states that although there are other factors in our education system that contribute to students dropping out of school, zero tolerance is a direct factor that contributes to high drop out numbers in a racially disproportionate manner. =Middle East= Palestinian school text books have come under repeated criticism for anti-Israeli bias. An independent study of Palestinian textbooks by Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University in Washington, DC, found that Palestine National Authority-authored books avoid treating anything controversial regarding Palestinian national identity, and while highly nationalistic, do not incite hatred, violence and anti-Semitism. An analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP), found that there was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. However in 2012, Nurit Peled-Elhanan, a professor of language and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, published Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education, an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books, finding that Israeli school books do in fact promote racism against and negative images of Arabs, and prepare Israeli children for compulsory military service. =South Asia= India In 1982 the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) issued guidelines for the rewriting of schoolbooks.(Indian Express 17 January 1982, New Delhi; Shourie 1998) It stipulated that: \\"Characterization of the medieval period as a time of conflict between Hindus and Muslims is forbidden.\\"(Elst 1992) In April 1989 the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had issued instructions to schools and publishers of textbooks that \\"Muslim rule should never attract any criticism. Destruction of temples by Muslim rulers and invaders should not be mentioned.\\"(Shourie 1998) Schools and publishers have been asked to ignore and delete mention of forcible conversions to Islam. Some academicians have felt that these \\"corrections\\" were politically motivated and that they are censorship.(The Statesman, 21 May 1989) Arun Shourie criticized these changes in schoolbooks and claimed: The most extensive deletions are ordered in regard to the chapter on \\"Aurangzeb's policy on religion\\". Every allusion to what he actually did to the Hindus, to their temples, to the very leitmotif of his rule ‚Äì to spread the sway of Islam ‚Äì are directed to be excised from the book. ... \\"In a word, no forcible conversions, no massacres, no destruction of temples. ... Muslim historians of those times are in raptures at the heap of Kafirs [sic] who have been dispatched to hell. Muslim historians are forever lavishing praise on the ruler for the temples he has destroyed, ... Law books like The Hedaya prescribe exactly the options to which these little textbooks alluded. All whitewashed away. Objective whitewash for objective history. And today if anyone seeks to restore truth to these textbooks, the shout, \\"Communal rewriting of history.\\"\\"Arun Shourie (1998) History textbooks and schoolbooks written by Marxist historian Romila Thapar have been criticized for being biased. . Pakistan Bias in education has been a common feature in the curriculum of many South Asian countries. According to Waghmar, many of the oriental societies are plagued by visceral nationalism and post- imperial neurosis where state-sanctioned dogmas suppress eclectic historical readings.Waghmar, B. (2005). Pakistan Studies: The State of the Craft. Dawn. 27 February. p. 5. Retrieved on 9 June 2008. Issues such as the preaching of hatred and obscurantism and the distortion of history in Pakistan have led the international scholars to suggest the need for coordinated efforts amongst the historians to produce a composite history of the subcontinent as a common South Asian reader.Verghese, B.G. (2004). Myth and hate as history . The Hindu. 23 June. Retrieved on 7 June 2008. Bias against Indians and Hindus, as well as other religious minorities, have been found in Pakistani schoolbooks.Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, The Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution: The Jama\`at-i Islami of Pakistan (University of California Press, 1994) p121-122 However, Nelson here stresses the need for any educational reform to be based at the needs of the level of local communities.Nelson, M.J. (2006). Muslims, Markets, and the Meaning of ‚ÄòA Good Education‚Äô in Pakistan . Asian Survey. 46(5). pp. 699-720. The bias in Pakistani textbooks was studied by Rubina Saigol, Pervez Hoodbhoy, K. K. Aziz, I. A. Rahman, Mubarak Ali, A. H. Nayyar, Ahmed Saleem, Yvette Rosser and others. A study by Nayyar & Salim (2003) that was conducted with 30 experts of Pakistan's education system, found that the textbooks contain statements that seek to create hate against Hindus. There was also an emphasis on Jihad, Shahadat, wars and military heroes. The study reported that the textbooks also had a lot of gender-biased stereotypes. Some of the problems in Pakistani textbooks cited in the report were: \\"Insensitivity to the existing religious diversity of the nation\\"; \\"Incitement to militancy and violence, including encouragement of Jehad and Shahadat\\"; a \\"glorification of war and the use of force\\"; \\"Inaccuracies of fact and omissions that serve to substantially distort the nature and significance of actual events in our history\\"; \\"Perspectives that encourage prejudice, bigotry and discrimination towards fellow citizens, especially women and religious minorities, and other towards nations\\" and \\"Omission of concepts ... that could encourage critical selfawareness among students\\".(Nayyar & Salim 2003) These problems still seem to persist: The Curriculum Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education rejected a textbook in December 2003 because of two serious objections: The textbook contained the text of letter of a non-Muslim, and it contained the story of a family were both husband and wife worked and were sharing their household chores. In February 2004, a textbook was disapproved by the Curriculum Wing because it didn't contain enough material on jihad.(Nayyar 2004) Pakistani textbooks were relatively unbiased up to 1972, but were rewritten and completely altered under Bhutto's and especially under Zia's (1977‚Äì88) rule. The bias in Pakistani textbooks was also documented by Yvette Rosser (2003). She wrote that \\"in the past few decades, social studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used as locations to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy makers have attempted to inculcate towards their Hindu neighbours\\", and that as a result \\"in the minds of generations of Pakistanis, indoctrinated by the 'Ideology of Pakistan' are lodged fragments of hatred and suspicion.\\"(Rosser 2003) Professors who have been critical of Pakistani politics or corruption have are sometimes discriminated against. Dr. Parvez Hoodbhoy, who was also a critic of Pakistani politics, had troubles leaving the country for a lecture in the Physics department at MIT, because he was denied a NOC (No Objection Certificate) necessary for travels abroad. One of the omissions in Pakistani textbooks is Operation Gibraltar. Operation Gibraltar, which provoked the Indian Army attack on Lahore, is not mentioned in most history textbooks. According to Pakistani textbooks, Lahore was attacked without any provocation on the part of the Pakistani army. The rule of Islamic invaders like Mahmud of Gahzni is glorified, while the much more peaceful Islamic ruler Akbar is often ignored in Pakistani textbooks. The Pakistani Curriculum document for classes K-V stated in 1995 that \\"at the completion of Class-V, the child should be able to\\": * \\"Acknowledge and identify forces that may be working against Pakistan.\\"[pg 154] * \\"Demonstrate by actions a belief in the fear of Allah.\\" [pg154] * \\"Make speeches on Jehad and Shahadat\\" [pg154] * \\"Understand Hindu-Muslim differences and the resultant need for Pakistan.\\" [pg154] * \\"India's evil designs against Pakistan.\\" [pg154] * \\"Be safe from rumour mongers who spread false news\\" [pg158] * \\"Visit police stations\\" [pg158] * \\"Collect pictures of policemen, soldiers, and National Guards\\" [pg158] * \\"Demonstrate respect for the leaders of Pakistan\\" [pg153](National Bureau of Curriculum and Textbooks Federal Ministry of Education, 1995 Government of Pakistan.

The bay is located south of Batticaloa, due east of Colombo, and approximately south of the market town of Pottuvil. The main settlement in the area, known locally as Ullae, is predominantly Muslim, however there is a significant Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhala population to the south of the village, as well as a number of international expatriates, largely from Europe and Australia. While traditionally fishing has dominated the local economy, tourism has grown rapidly in the area in recent years. Arugam Kudah's literal Tamil translation is \\"Bay of Cynodon dactylon\\". Tourism in Arugam Bay is dominated by surf tourism, thanks to several quality breaks in the area, however tourists are also attracted by the local beaches, lagoons, historic temples and the nearby Kumana National Park. Conflict between fishing and tourism During the period of fighting between the central government and Tamil separatists tourism was fairly low key and the hotels often bought the catch of the fishermen.The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein, p. 386 As a result of the peace tourism expanded and many fishing people who had the moved to areas less touched by the conflict returned and hotel owners began to complain about the smell of drying fish and how the fishing huts block their viewThe Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein, pp. 386‚Äì7 In the aftermath of the Tsunami fishing people were forbidden to return, officially on the grounds of safety but allegedly as a result of pressure from the hotel owners.The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein, pp. 388‚Äì97 Surrounding areas The nearby () Muslim village of Pottuvil is the center of commerce and transportation while tourist accommodations lie along the beach to the south of Pottuvil Arugam Bay () is also the gateway and the only road access to the Yala East National Park.

Its roots went back to a Union soldier who remained in Marion after the end of the Civil War to teach newly freed African Americans. His efforts proved successful and in 1867 the school was incorporated with the support of African Americans from the surrounding Perry County. Founded less than two years after the end of the Civil War as the Lincoln Normal School in Marion, Alabama, it is one of the oldest HBCUs in the United States. Nine ex-slaves, Joey Pinch, Thomas Speed, Nickolas Dale, James Childs, Thomas Lee, John Freeman, Nathan Levert, David Harris, and Alexander H. Curtis, made up the first Board of Trustees. Under their guidance, the black and white community of Marion raised five hundred dollars to buy land for the school's campus. The money to build the school building came from the American Missionary Association (AMA). In 1868, school trustees sought the assistance of the American Missionary Association (AMA) for help with day-to-day operation of the school. The AMA supplied teachers and financial support. Teacher Training In 1870, the school expanded to include teacher training and for a time became known as the Lincoln Normal University for Teachers. The program primarily focused on training African American high school graduates to become teachers. In 1885, Lincoln School was voted the top school for freed slaves in the south.See, Curtis, Nancy C., Black Heritage Sites: An African American Odyssey and Finder's Guide,(Nancy Curtis: 1996) p. 25, found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk7NPRm_nB0C&pg;=PA25&dq;=lincoln+normal+school+marion+alabama#v=onepage&q;=lincoln%20normal%20school%20marion%20alabama&f;=false On July 26, 1878, William Burns Paterson left Tullibody Academy to accept the Presidency of the State Normal School and University for Colored Students and Teachers in Marion, Alabama. In 1887 fire destroyed many of the campus buildings. As a result, the teacher training function was relocated to Montgomery where it became Alabama State University. Faculty The school was led by several principals, most notably Miss Mary Elizabeth Phillips. During her tenure from 1896 to 1927 both the campus and student body expanded. In 1939, alumni and friends constructed Phillips Memorial Auditorium in her honor. Other notable faculty included Cecil and Fran Thomas who were instrumental in establishing a choral program at the school. Under their direction, choirs from the school toured across the Southeast and Midwest.See footnote at, The Papers of Martin Luther King Jr., Birth of a New Age, December 1955-December 1956, Clayborne Carson, editor, (University of California Press, 1996), at p. 28, found online at https://books.google.com/books?id=GkHrnFzEykwC&pg;=RA5-PA28-IA1&dq;=cecil+and+fran+thomas+lincoln+school+marion+alabama#v=onepage&q;=cecil%20and%20fran%20thomas%20lincoln%20school%20marion%20alabama&f;=false Legacy and Reputation Lincoln School became well known for graduating a high proportion of students who went on to attain advanced degrees, a remarkable achievement for any school but more particularly for a segregated high school in rural Alabama.See, The Crisis, an official publication of the NAACP, Vol. 79-80, p. 156, 1972.

Tovey wrote, \\"Sir Hubert Parry has aptly compared the opening of [this sonata] with that of the finale of Mozart's G minor symphony to show how much closer Beethoven's texture is. The slow movement ... well illustrates the rare cases in which Beethoven imitates Mozart to the detriment of his own proper richness of tone and thought, while the finale in its central episode brings a misapplied and somewhat diffuse structure in Mozart's style into a direct conflict with themes as Beethovenish in their terseness as in their sombre passion\\".Donald Tovey, \\"Beethoven\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition  Structure  The sonata is in four movements: =I. Allegro= The first movement, in cut common time, is in the tonic key of F minor and in conventional sonata form, as was typical at Beethoven's time. A tense, agitated feel is ubiquitous throughout the movement. The piece opens with an ascending arpeggiated figure (a so-called Mannheim Rocket, like that opening the fourth movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40),Cummings, Robert. \\"Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor, Op. 2/1 (1793‚Äì1795)\\" in All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music, p. 106 (Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott eds., Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005)., culminating in a sixteenth-note triplet turn.

After a short intriguing fermata, the ascending- arpeggio motif is now introduced on the dominant-minor key (C minor), played by the left hand. This is seamlessly continued by imitative sequences (mm. 9‚Äì14), effectively working as a transition preparing the secondary key (see sonata form). An ascending bass progression leading to a half-close in the key of A major is played three times (mm. 15‚Äì20) against syncopated descending thirds on the right hand, all of which inequivocably establishes A major (the relative major of F minor) as the secondary key. (Using the relative major as secondary key is the most conventional procedure for minor-key sonata expositions.) A new melodic subject based on a descending arpeggio is presented over a ceaseless dominant pedal in broken octaves (mm. 20‚Äì25). This subject clearly references the opening subject of the sonata, both being quarter-note arpeggios, whilst contrasting with it by inverting its contour (descending vs. ascending), articulation (legato vs. staccato) and harmony (outlining a dominant ninth chord as opposed to the tonic chord in the opening subject). This dual quality of unity and contrast achieved by using the same musical material in opposite ways (to articulate the tonic and secondary keys respectively), proved to be a very effective device for Beethoven, which he would use again for his other much more famous piano sonata in F minor. The second subject stays in A major throughout, as would be expected of conventional sonata form, although it also hints its parallel minor key (A minor). After sequencing iterations (mm. 26-31) of the 3-note motif that followed the descending arpeggio, the music seems to really take off on a loud closing theme outlining a cadential progression (III6, IV6, V, V7). which is played twice (mm. 33‚Äì40) and solidly resolves to an A major chord. A little codetta (mm. 41-48) echoing the second half of the opening subject (m. 2), again with shadings of A minor, and eventually resolving in an emphatically perfect cadence (the first one so far). The exposition is repeated. The development opens with the initial theme (mm. 49‚Äì54) in the secondary key, but is mostly dedicated to the second subject and its eighth-note accompaniment (mm. 55‚Äì73), first in its original form, then exchanging roles between the hands. This goes through the relatively close keys of B minor, C minor, B minor and back to A major, where it creates a sequence on the last two notes of the theme (mm. 73‚Äì80), going through a descending-fifths progression leading to a terse dominant pedal on C (mm. 81‚Äì94), preparing the return of the tonic key. A very quiet passage of mysterious-sounding suspensions follows (mm. 95‚Äì100), over which the exposition's transition material is reprised, serving as a very effective retransition back to the opening material. The recapitulation (mm. 101‚Äì145) starts loudly instead of quietly (a common device in Beethoven's early piano sonatas), and with many of the left-hand chords now happening on strong beats, unlike the syncopated exposition. Most events from the exposition are reprised in the same order, with slight changes of dynamics and voicings. Most significantly, all the material previously stated on the secondary key is now restated in the tonic, so that this time the final perfect cadence is heard on the tonic-key, giving a satisfying resolution to the key dichotomy in the exposition. To this end, the original transition to the secondary key is rewritten passing through the subdominant key and leading back to the tonic, which is a conventional procedure in classical sonata recapitulations. At the end of the recapitulation, instead of giving the perfect cadence in the exact parallel location to that of the exposition, Beethoven delays the resolution for an extra 6 bars, during which two 'fake' attempts at a final resolution (in the subdominant and relative major keys, respectively) heighten anticipation for the 'true' cadence. The movement finishes on a fortissimo perfect cadence on F minor. =II. Adagio= The second movement opens with a highly ornamented lyrical theme in time in F major. This movement is in ternary form. This is followed by a more agitated transitional passage in D minor accompanied by quiet parallel thirds, followed by a passage full of demisemiquavers in C major. This leads back to a more embellished form of the F major theme, which is followed by an F major variation of the C major section. This Adagio is the earliest composition by Beethoven now in general circulation; it was adapted from the slow movement of his Piano Quartet No. 3 in C major from 1785.Michael Steinberg: \\"The Beethoven Piano Sonatas\\", Notes from the Richard Goode recording of the complete Beethoven Sonatas, Elektra Nonesuch label, 1993 :650px =III. Menuetto and Trio (Allegretto)= The third movement, a minuet in F minor, is conventional in form. It contains two repeated sections, followed by a trio in F major in two repeated sections, after which the first minuet returns. The minuet is characterized by syncopations, dramatic pauses and sharp dynamic contrast, and like many minor-key minuets has a somewhat melancholy tone spanning major and minor tonality. The trio is built around longer, more lyric phrases that pass between the right and left hands in imitative polyphony. The main material is reprised after the trio. :650px =IV. Prestissimo= The fourth movement, like the first and third, is in the tonic-minor key (F minor), is in cut common time and bears the tempo marking prestissimo (\\"very fast\\"). It has the form of a modified sonata-allegro movement, in which the development section has been replaced with a contrasting middle section. The movement opens with fast triplet eighth-note arpeggios on the left hand, over which the main three-chord motif in staccato quarter notes is introduced two beats later: :650px The eighth-note triplet figuration pervades throughout most of the exposition, alongside the main motif's character of energetic frantic pursuit of something elusive. A transitional passage modulates to the dominant-minor key (C minor), where a more lyrical but still agitated theme is presented twice. It is noteworthy that Beethoven chose the dominant-minor key as the secondary key, instead of the more conventional relative major. The exposition closes emphatically on C minor, with iterations of the first subject chordal motif. Instead of developing earlier material (as would be expected of a conventional allegro-sonata movement), the following middle section starts off with a peaceful new theme in the relative major key (A major), thus compensating for its absence as the exposition's secondary key. This A major theme is articulated in quarter-notes, providing a respite from the eighth- note triplets that pervaded most of the exposition. This major theme provides the answer to the rocket theme that opens the sonata (both ascending, one lyrical and major, the other percussive and minor). It is structured on compound-binary form, where both phrases are played twice each in slightly varied fashion. This is followed by an extended retransition based on alternating motives from the exposition first subject and the middle-section theme. The recapitulation reprises the whole exposition nearly identically (apart from very slight changes in dynamics and voicings), but significantly all the material is now re-stated in the tonic key (F minor), as would be expected of any conventional sonata form. The movement ends on a fortissimo eighth-note-triplet descending arpeggio, perhaps to give a symmetrical ending to a sonata that opened with a raising arpeggio.

It was written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and stars Balthazar Getty, Henry Rollins, Navi Rawat, Judah Friedlander, Jenny Wade, Gulager's father Clu Gulager, Josh Zuckerman and Jason Mewes. The story revolves around a group of people gathered inside a local bar in Nevada, where they are suddenly attacked by a horde of monstrous creatures. Feast is a result of the amateur filmmaking documentary series and contest Project Greenlights third season. The winning team was composed of writers Dunstan and Melton and director Gulager. The executive producers were Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Moore (through their LivePlanet production company), Wes Craven and the Maloof family. The film had a limited release in the United States on September 22, 2006, and premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival on April 14, 2005. Upon its release, it received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, while some highly praised the cast performances as well as the story's humor. It grossed only $658 thousand against a production budget of $3 million. Plot As people are enjoying drinks in a bar, a man covered in blood‚Äîidentified onscreen as \\"Hero\\" (Eric Dane)‚Äîenters through the door and warns them all of impending danger. No one heeds his warning, so he shows the bar patrons the head of a repulsive creature to make them take him seriously. He is soon pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters. After the carnage, a woman‚Äî\\"Heroine\\" (Navi Rawat)‚Äîbursts through the door and reveals herself to be the recently deceased man's wife. After a brief sentimental moment between the wife and her late husband, the bar patrons begin boarding up the windows in the bar. Despite their efforts, a young monster bursts through an uncovered window and begins attacking. As a monster outside bursts its hand through \\"Vet\\" (Anthony \\"Treach\\" Criss), \\"Edgy Cat\\" (Jason Mewes) has his face torn off and is accidentally shot dead, and the little monster cuts off the leg of one of the women ‚Äî \\"Harley Mom\\" (Diane Ayala Goldner)‚Äîwho is initially assumed to have died from massive blood loss. The monster disappears for some time, then is found attempting to sexually penetrate one of the deer heads nailed to the wall. A shotgun blast removes the deer head and monster. The monster drops into a freezer which is then sealed shut, trapping it inside. Following this, the remaining windows are boarded up and the bar patrons are given a moment of peace. Trying to call for help, they learn that the only phone in the bar has been hit by a stray shotgun blast and rendered useless. One of the women‚Äî\\"Tuffy\\" (Krista Allen)‚Äîsuddenly realizes that her son Cody (Tyler Patrick Jones) is still upstairs and runs to get him. Once she finds her child the group rejoices until the boy is pulled through a window and eaten by one of the monsters, leaving only his right foot behind. Tuffy is incapacitated by grief, while the monster vomits a stream of slime at one of the group‚Äî\\"Beer Guy\\" (Judah Friedlander). As the remaining people regroup downstairs, they realize that the slime has a decomposing effect and that Beer Guy is being slowly overcome by its effects. The group kills the young monster in the freezer and hangs it outside. The monster's parents quickly eat the child, have sex and produce two offspring in a matter of seconds, all of whom begin to attack the pub with renewed fury. Meanwhile, one of the women‚Äî\\"Honey Pie\\" (Jenny Wade)‚Äîbegins washing off the blood and has to take off her clothes, much to the amusement of the others. The patrons regroup and enact various attempts to escape or drive off the monsters, including using Harley Mom's body as boobytrap while the Heroine and the \\"Coach\\" (Henry Rollins) attempt to escape. Upon discovering she's still alive, \\"Bossman\\" (Duane Whitaker) continues to prepare to sacrifice her to the creatures when she is suddenly grabbed by a baby monster that starts sexually assaulting her. The distraction fails, leading to the accidental death of the Heroine at the hands of another character, \\"Bozo\\" (Balthazar Getty). Driven by rage over the death of her child, Tuffy aggressively takes charge of the remaining survivors, which results in the audience seeing her nickname change from \\"Tuffy\\" to \\"Heroine 2\\". After \\"Coach\\" and \\"Bossman\\" are killed, \\"Honey Pie\\" successfully makes it to a truck, giving the other characters brief cause for hope (until they realize she is speeding off by herself). A fight to the death between the last remaining humans and monsters ensues, resulting in the deaths of \\"Beer Guy\\" and supposedly the \\"Bartender\\" (Clu Gulager). Bozo, his brother Hot Wheels (Josh Zuckerman), and Tuffy (Heroine 2) survive, and drive off to retrieve the Heroine and Hero's daughter. One person‚Äî\\"Grandma\\" (Eileen Ryan)‚Äîis shown to still be alive within the bar but is attacked by one of the remaining monsters.

History In 1927, William A. Logus and Leo F. Smith purchased of land on Hayden Island from the Portland Electric Power Company. Logus and Smith headed the Hayden Island Amusement Company and they built an amusement resort and tourist park named Jantzen Beach Amusement Park for one of the park's investors, Carl Jantzen, of Jantzen swimsuit fame. The door opened to the public on May 26, 1928. It surpassed all attendance expectations; over 30 million people patronized the park through its 42 years. On opening day, Saturday May 26, 1928, 15,000 people paid the $0.10 admission. The following day, 25,000 people came out to the park. The amusement park included a merry-go-round, fun house, Big Dipper roller coaster, Golden Canopy Ballroom, four swimming pools, a natatorium, of picnic grounds, and of parking. The C.W. Parker carousel, built in 1921, was moved to Jantzen Beach in 1927. Some of the hand carved horses were made by inmates of the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. The amusement park's popularity peaked during the 1940s. In the late 1950s, attendance declined while the commercial value of the land increased. The park closed on Labor Day, 1970. The pumping system from the swimming pools remains installed, and is used to pump drinking water to the residents of Hayden Island. The Jantzen Beach Carousel, also known as the C.W. Parker Four-Row Park Carousel, was installed inside the Jantzen Beach Mall, a shopping mall located on the grounds formerly occupied by the park, and it operated there from 1972 to 2012. However, it was removed in 2012 for the reconstruction of the shopping center, and it remains in storage . The carousel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 but was removed in 2008.

Movements It has four movements: =I. Allegro vivace= :600px An athletic movement that has a bright disposition. The second theme of exposition contains some striking modulations for the time period. A large portion of the development section is in F major, which contains a third relationship with the key of the work, A major. A difficult, but beautiful canonic section is also to be found in the development. The recapitulation contains no coda and the movement ends quietly and unassumingly. Tovey wrote, \\"The opening of the second subject in the first movement is a wonderful example of the harmonic principle previously mentioned...In all music, nothing equally dramatic can be found before the D minor sonata Opus 31 No. 2 which is rightly regarded as marking the beginning of Beethoven's second period.\\" =II. Largo appassionato= :600px One of the few instances in which Beethoven uses the tempo marking Largo, which was the slowest such marking for a movement. The opening imitates the style of a string quartet and features a staccato pizzicato-like bass against lyrical chords. A high degree of contrapuntal thinking is evident in Beethoven's conception of this movement. The key is the subdominant of A major, D major. Tovey wrote, \\"The slow movement shows a thrilling solemnity that immediately proves the identity of the pupil of Haydn with the creator of the 9th symphony.\\" =III. Scherzo: Allegretto= :600px A short and graceful movement that is in many respects similar to a minuet. This is the first instance in his 32 numbered sonatas in which the term \\"Scherzo\\" is used. The A minor trio section adds contrast to the cheerful opening material of this movement. Unusually, there is a second melody (not in the trio) in the remote key of G minor. =IV. Rondo: Grazioso= :600px A beautiful and lyrical rondo. The arpeggio that opens the repeated material becomes more elaborate at each entrance. The form of this rondo is A1‚ÄìB1‚ÄìA2‚ÄìC‚ÄìA3‚ÄìB2‚ÄìA4‚ÄìCoda. The C section, in the parallel minor A minor, is rather agitated and stormy in comparison to the rest of the work, and is representative of the so-called \\"Sturm und Drang\\" style. A simple but elegant V7‚ÄìI perfect cadence closes the entire work in the lower register, played piano. A typical performance lasts about 22 minutes.

It used two slightly separated antenna elements to send the beam slightly to either side of the midline of the antenna, switching between the two to find which one gave the stronger return, thereby indicating which direction the antenna should be moved in order to point directly at the target. The concept was used only briefly, and was almost completely replaced by conical scanning systems by the end of World War II. The concept is also known as sequential lobing, although this terminology appears to be rare, and the associated output was sometimes known as a split display. Description Early radar antennas generally consisted of a number of small dipole antennas in front of a passive reflector. The dipoles were placed in order to have them constructively interfere in front of the antenna, thereby \\"aiming\\" the signal in that direction. The beam's angular spread is a function of the number of elements, with more elements producing a more tightly focussed beam. A huge number of such elements would be ideal, but impractical due to them having to be placed at a specific distance to each other depending on the wavelength of the radio source being used. In early \\"longwave\\" systems, like those used by the British and US, this forced the elements to be placed several feet apart, limiting the number of dipoles to perhaps a dozen for any reasonably sized antenna. The resulting beam angles for such a system were generally too wide to be used directly for gun laying. For instance, the US's SCR-268 had a beam width of 2 degrees, and once the target entered that beam, the operator could not easily say where in the beam it was. An angle accuracy of about 0.1 degree would be needed for direct gunlaying. In early use the system was simply paired with a searchlight, which would be directed to the target by the radar, and then the gunners would aim visually. In this role, even during the day, the range information the radar provided was still invaluable. Lobe switching concept. In this diagram the two lobes are shown in yellow, and the resulting \\"summed\\" signal in blue. If the aircraft were to move slightly up, the signal strength in the lower lobe would drop off rapidly, while growing rapidly in the upper lobe. The operator would then aim the antenna upward to compensate, until the two returns were equal again. Lobe switching offered greatly improved accuracy for the addition of a small amount of complexity. Instead of a single set of dipole elements, two were placed at each point on the array. The radio signal was then alternately switched between the two sets of dipoles, normally through a motor-driven mechanical switch. The return signal from one set was sent through a small delay, shifting its \\"peak\\" on the operator's oscilloscope slightly to one side. Since the switching was faster than the eye could follow, the result appeared as two well formed peaks on the display. Since each lobe was slightly off center, if the target was not centered down the middle of the antenna (as a whole), one of the two return signals would have greater strength than the other. Thus the operator could keep the antenna pointed at the target simply by moving it to make both returns equal height on the display. Since the lobes were arranged to overlap only slightly, there was only a very small angle where the two returns would be equal - even slight movements of the target out of the centerline would quickly make one signal much stronger. The resulting measurement was therefore much more accurate. Conical scanning was similar in concept to lobe switching, but as the name implies it was operated in a rotary fashion instead of two directions. This allowed the operator to get a 2-D view of which direction had the strongest return, and was much easier to operate as a result. However, conical scanning could only easily be used on an antenna with a single feed horn, which is only practical with microwave radars. As such systems were introduced into service, lobe switching generally disappeared. Jamming It is possible to jam a lobe switching radar with relative ease if one knows the basic operating frequencies of the radar. In the case of a lobe switching set that switches lobes 30 times a second, a jammer can be constructed to send out a weak signal on the same frequency that also varies 30 times a second, but only sends out a signal when the radar's lobe is pointed away from the aircraft - which is easily found by looking for a low point in the received signal. At the receiver end the two signals are mixed, and the additional signal from the aircraft's jammer \\"smooths out\\" the strong/weak signal that would otherwise be seen. This denies the radar angle information, and can make anything but gross angle tracking difficult. = Lobe on receive only = One way to avoid this problem is known as lobe on receive only (LORO), which uses one set of antenna elements to send a non-lobe-switched signal, and two additional sets for lobe switching on reception. Operation is basically identical to a normal lobing radar, but it denies any information about the lobing to the target aircraft, for the cost of some additional antenna elements (or more commonly, a second antenna). Unsynchronized \\"blocks\\" of signal can be used to jam LORO radars, although it is not as effective as against a \\"normal\\" lobing system and generally makes the operator's job difficult, as opposed to impossible. The SCR-268, the US Army's first radar system, was one of the first radar sets to use lobe switching of its receiving antennas as a means to aim anti-aircraft searchlight beams at aircraft.

MSX offered the first system demonstration of technology in space to identify and track ballistic missiles during their midcourse flight phase.Williams, Frank. \\"Space-Based Surveillance Operations Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration,\\" Space Tactics Bulletin, Vol 6, Issue 4 History On 24 April 1996, the BMDO launched the MSX satellite on a Delta II booster from Vandenberg AFB, California. MSX was placed in a sun- synchronous orbit at 898 km and an inclination of 99.16 degrees. MSX's mission was to gather data in three spectral bands (long wavelength infrared, visible, and ultraviolet). MSX became a contributing sensor to the Space Surveillance Network on 13 May 1998. The only person on record ever hit by space debris was hit by a piece of the Delta II rocket that launched MSX. Lottie Williams was exercising in a park in Tulsa on January 22, 1997 when she was hit in the shoulder by a piece of blackened metallic material. U.S, Space Command confirmed that a used Delta II rocket from the April 1996 launch of the Midcourse Space Experiment had crashed into the atmosphere 30 minutes earlier. The object tapped her on the shoulder and fell off harmlessly onto the ground. Williams collected the item and NASA tests later showed that the fragment was consistent with the materials of the rocket, and Nicholas Johnson, the agency's chief scientist for orbital debris, believes that she was indeed hit by a piece of the rocket. Operations Operational from 1996‚Äì1997, MSX mapped the galactic plane and areas either missed or identified as particularly bright by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) at wavelengths of 4.29 Œºm, 4.35 Œºm, 8.28 Œºm, 12.13 Œºm, 14.65 Œºm, and 21.3 Œºm. It carried the 33-cm SPIRIT III infrared telescope with solid hydrogen-cooled five line-scanned infrared focal plane arrays. Alpha Centauri by MSX Calibration of MSX posed a challenge for designers of the experiment, as baselines did not exist for the bands it would be observing under. Engineers solved the problem by having MSX fire projectiles of known composition in front of the detector, and calibrating the instruments to the known black-body curves of the objects. The MSX calibration serves as the basis for other satellites working in the same wavelength range, including AKARI (2006-2011) and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). MSX data is currently available in the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) provided by NASA's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC).

A typical performance lasts 15 minutes. While it is not as well known as some of the more original sonatas of Beethoven's youth, such as the Path√©tique or Moonlight sonatas, Donald Francis Tovey described it as an 'exquisite little work.'Tovey, D.F. (1931) Commentary on Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, London, ABRSM. Form The sonata is in three movements: The first movement, marked legato in the urtext score, opens with a brief sixteenth-note phrase, accompanied by short, tied arpeggios in the bass. This phrase is used consistently throughout the movement and subject to a great deal of highly imaginative development through changing harmonies and shifting key-centres. Bars 70‚Äì80 are particularly notable, in that the main theme is subjected to highly chromatic treatment at this point. Thirty-second-note passages develop in the upper register of the piano, limiting the tempo at which it can reasonably be taken. The entire movement ends with a coda, where, according to Charles Rosen, Beethoven 'decides to normalize the rhythm of the main theme, and make it no longer witty but expressive.' The closing two bars consist of a quiet, quick turn in the treble. The second movement is a set of variations on a disjunct, chordal theme which is marked \\"La prima parte senza replica\\" (first part without repeats). The form of the music is Theme with Three Variations. It seems about to end quietly, like the first and last movements, but then concludes abruptly with a crashing fortissimo C major chord. Like the first movement, the third movement opens with an ascending, hesitant, three- note motif that conveys considerable rhythmic ambiguity. In his book, The Music Instinct, the science writer Philip BallBall, P. (2010) The Music Instinct, London, The Bodley Head singles out this theme as an example of the classic trick of disguising 'one rhythmic structure as another'. The movement, which is in time, is entitled \\"Scherzo\\" but is actually in rondo form. The main theme undergoes many changes, until the end, where it ends quietly, on the very lowest notes of the piano of Beethoven's time. The movement plays with listener expectations through rhythmic ambiguity, unexpected harmonic shifts, and above all, the use of strategically placed silences. All of these characteristic examples of musical wit show the continuing influence of Haydn on Beethoven at this early stage in his composing career.

Beethoven regarded it as the best of his early sonatas, though some of its companions in the cycle have been at least as popular with the public.\\"Artur Pizarro ‚Äî The Beethoven Sonata Cycle\\", BBC Radio 3 (accessed August 3, 2015). Prominent musicologist Donald Francis Tovey has called this work the crowning achievement and culmination of Beethoven's early \\"grand\\" piano sonatas. (The \\"grand\\" modifier was applied by Beethoven to sonatas with four movements instead of three.) Subsequent sonatas find Beethoven experimenting more with form and concept. Structure The sonata has four movements:Cummings, Robert. \\"Piano Sonata No. 11 in B Flat Major, Op. 22 (1800)\\" in All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music, p. 108 (Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott eds., Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005). A typical performance lasts 25‚Äì30 minutes. = I. Allegro con brio = The first movement is in typical sonata form. The exposition starts in the tonic key and transitions into the dominant key as the second theme begins. The development plays around with the closing measures of the exposition before making the right hand play arpeggios as the bass line slowly descends chromatically. The theme of the closing octaves from the exposition comes back again in the bass, leading into a chromatic scale resolving in an F dominant seventh chord (dominant function of the sonata), which sets up the recapitulation. The recapitulation is at first the same as the exposition, but has some changes, with a deviation that sets the rest of the movement to stay in the tonic key. = II. Adagio con molto espressione = The second movement is in E major and is also in sonata form. Its opening melody is often compared to the later music of Chopin. The exposition starts in the tonic key and ends in the dominant key. The development plays around with the first theme of the exposition, slowly building intensity until both hands play constant sixteenth notes. The right hand plays a second voice above its 16th notes, and a little later, the left hand plays a bass line consisting of just Bs. The left hand then stops and the right hand flows right into the recapitulation. The recapitulation stays in the tonic key for the rest of the movement. = III. Menuetto = The third movement is in minuet and trio form, but the trio is instead a very contrasting \\"Minore\\". The first 30 measures of the Menuetto are in B major, the Minore is in G minor (the relative minor of B flat major). The end of the Minore is marked Menuetto D.C. senza replica which means to play the Menuetto again, this time without taking the repeats. This is the shortest movement. = IV. Rondo: Allegretto = The fourth movement is in a rondo form: A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìCoda. The first \\"A\\" theme starts in the tonic key, and the \\"B\\" theme transitions into the dominant key with big grand arpeggios in the right hand using a good portion of the keyboard. After the arpeggios, both hands play around with the \\"A\\" theme's melody before arriving back to the tonic key at the second \\"A\\" theme (with very little deviation from the first \\"A\\" theme). Suddenly, the \\"C\\" theme begins with a key change into B minor (although not marked in the key signature). The sharp forte chords, although in stark contrast with the rest of the rondo, bear some resemblance to the first few chords of the \\"B\\" theme. The right hand then plays urgent thirty-second notes while the left hand supports with staccato sixteenth notes. This reaches a climax, a call-and-response play on the beginning of the \\"C\\" theme, and the thirty-second-note passage with the climax again. Not unlike the end of the \\"B\\" theme, the \\"A\\" theme's melody is suggested a few times before returning to the tonic key and a third \\"A\\" section. However, the melody of this \\"A\\" section is in the left hand until the right hand has a two- measure thirty-second-note run that flows into the rest of the melody, this time the right hand octaves being broken. The next section (second \\"B\\" section) is very similar to the first \\"B\\" section except that it stays in the tonic key all the way through. A fake \\"A\\" section is played in the subdominant key before developing into the final \\"A\\" section where the melody consists of triplet sixteenth notes instead of regular sixteenth notes. The very end of the final \\"A\\" sections runs right into the coda that builds up to an exciting final climax before relaxing to a piano dynamic level and two big chords (dominant seventh to tonic) to conclude the sonata.

He had already made a name for himself in Vienna as pianist and composerGordon (2005, 5) and was beginning to explore alternatives to the classical-era compositional procedures that he had largely adhered to during the 18th century. The most famous works of his \\"middle period\\", often emphasizing heroism, were yet to come.

Both Op. 27 sonatas were originally titled . The dedicatee of the work was (as was typical of the time) an aristocrat, Princess Josephine von Liechtenstein. Little is known of Beethoven's relationship with her. =Quasi una fantasia= Grove Music Online translates the Italian title as \\"sonata in the manner of a fantasy\\".Quasi. Grove Music Online (Oxford Music Online). Retrieved 7 January 2012. While we cannot know precisely why Beethoven used this description for the two Op. 27 sonatas, several explanations are available.Jones (1999, 55‚Äì65) In the case of the present work (though not its companion), the entire sonata is played continuously without pauses between movements, in the manner of most fantasias.Marston (2000, 93) The movements are not in the usual order for a sonata: the opening movement is a slow movement and the scherzo and slow movement are in inverted order. The first movement is not in sonata form, as is true for most sonatas. As Kenneth Drake has pointed out, the movements are in extreme contrast with each other, a common trait of the sections of a fantasia.Quoted in Sisman (1998, 70) Lastly, the appearance of a quotation from one movement within another (here, from the third movement within the fourth) is a form of freedom not ordinarily employed in classical sonatas.Beethoven would return to this procedure in the Fifth Symphony, the piano sonata Opus 101, the cello sonata Opus 102 No. 1 (Marston 2000, 93) and the Ninth Symphony. There are precedents from Haydn; his 31st and 46th symphonies. Several of these patterns are mentioned in Lewis Lockwood's discussion of the aesthetics of Beethoven's \\"\\" works: Movements The Op. 27 No. 1 sonata is laid out in four movements: The opening four bars of the first movement: Andante. The first movement is in five-part rondo form instead of sonata form, unusual for Beethoven. The tempo is slow, interrupted by a fast medial section. The second movement is a scherzo and is in ternary form (the norm for scherzi). The main theme consists of mostly quarter notes in parallel octaves. When it returns following the trio section, the left hand plays staccato and the notes of the right hand part (still legato) are offset half a beat later. The movement includes a brief coda and concludes on the chord C major, a Picardy third. The third movement is slow in tempo and features a lyrical, noble theme, set against an eighth note accompaniment (in a later appearance, 16ths). The movement does not conclude in its tonic key, but instead reaches a final cadenza that leads directly to the finale. The movement is brief and thus might be heard by some listeners as an introduction to the final movement rather than as an independent movement. The finale is the most extended movement of the work; Charles Rosen notes, \\"With this movement, Beethoven began an experiment, to which he continued to return and develop through the years, of displacing some of the weight of the work from the opening movement to the finale\\".Some later instances of the same procedure include the companion piano sonata Op. 27 No. 2 (Marston 2000, 93), the piano sonatas Op. 101 (Marston 2000, 93), and Opus 111, the cello sonata Op. 102 No. 1 (Marston 2000, 93), and the Eighth Symphony. The work is in fast tempo and in sonata rondo form.Steward (2005, 114) In the coda section, the main theme of the slow movement briefly returns, followed by a brief cadenza. There follows a short final section, marked Presto, based on a tightly compressed version of the main theme. A typical performance of the work lasts 15 minutes.
