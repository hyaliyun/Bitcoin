It borders V√§sterg√∂tland, Sm√•land, Scania and the sea of Kattegat. Until 1645 and the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro, it was part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Administration The provinces of Sweden serve no administrative function. Instead, that function is served by the Counties of Sweden. However, the province of Halland is almost coextensive with the administrative Halland County, though parts of the province belong to V√§stra G√∂taland County and Sk√•ne County, while the county also includes parts of Sm√•land and V√§sterg√∂tland. As of December 31, 2016, Halland had a population of 327,093. Of these, 310,536 lived in Halland County; 14,205 lived in V√§stra G√∂taland County; and 2,352 lived in Sk√•ne County. Heraldry During the Danish era until 1658, the province had no coat of arms and no seal. In Sweden, however, every province had been represented by heraldic arms since 1560.Clara Nev√©us, Bror Jacques de W√¶rn: Ny svensk vapenbok. Riksarkivet 1992. (In Swedish) When Charles X Gustav of Sweden suddenly died in 1660 a coat of arms had to be created for the newly acquired province. Each province was to be represented by its arms at the royal funeral. There are several theories about the choice of a lion. Bengt Algotsson, duke of Halland and Finland in the 14th century, used a lion in his personal arms. Blazon: Azure, a Lion rampant Argent langued, armed and dente Gules. The same coat of arms was later granted for the administrative Halland County, which has almost the same boundaries. Geography The rivers of Lagan, √Ñtran, Nissan and Viskan flow through the province and reach the sea in Kattegat. Halland is well known for its fertile soil and as an agricultural district. Most of the region is made up of a relief unit known as the Sub-Mesozoic hilly peneplain. Around Morup and Tv√•√•ker hilltops are remnants of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain, an ancient erosion surface that covers much of eastern Sweden. Loose flint nodules of Cretaceous age have been found around Halland. The flints are remnants of a former cover of sedimentary rock that has been eroded. At present the sedimentary cover continues to exist in Scania, Denmark and offshore.  History =Early history The Bronze Age was probably a period of relative prosperity in Halland. This is shown in the number of new settlements and the numerous archaeological remains. Over 1,100 tumuli and grave mounds have been found. The end of the Bronze Age witnessed an over-consumption of resources. Large areas were deforested. This might have been a result of a high demand for charcoal in smelting gold or bronze among the local elites. The worsening climate at the beginning of the Iron Age meant that the local elites no longer could obtain bronze to the same extent as before. As a result, the social structures collapsed. The early Iron Age social structures seem to have been relatively egalitarian, but from around 200 AD there was a trend in which villages formed larger communities and small kingdoms. This is likely to have been a distant influence from the growing Roman Empire. During the 5th and 6th century large free-standing farms were created; they grew larger as time passed. An example of such a farm can be found in Sl√∂inge. It was not just the social structure that changed, so too did the settlement structure. New villages were formed, while old ones were abandoned. The new centers that were formed became the kernel from which new areas were settled during medieval times. 800‚Äì1645 AD According to information from a trader travelling from Skiringssal, close to the Oslofjord to Hedeby in the 870s it can be concluded that Halland was a Danish area at that time. It would stay so for most of recorded history. Iron extraction is known to have taken place in Hishult and Tv√•√•ker/Sibbarp during the Iron Age. As part of the Scanian lands (then part of the Kingdom of Denmark) Halland came under the Scanian Law and participated in the Scanian Thing, one of three Things electing the Danish king. Local assemblies took place in Getinge. Halland was the scene of considerable military action from the 13th century and on as Sweden, Denmark and to some degree Norway fought for supremacy in Scandinavia. The many wars made the province poor. Not only were material damages caused by military action, but the social impact of the fighting was devastating; people lacked the motivation to invest in their land and properties as it was likely to be destroyed anyway. The county was the site of combat and plunder three times during the 13th Century: in 1256 Haakon IV of Norway invaded, followed by Magnus III of Sweden in 1277 and Eric VI of Denmark in 1294. The county came to be split in two parts for the next century, with the river √Ñtran forming a boundary. The lords of the two parts succeeded each other in a high tempo. As the Kalmar Union was formed, Halland came for a brief period of time to be centrally located. According to the union treaty, the king was to be elected in Halmstad. During the rebellion of Engelbrekt in 1434 the fortress in Falkenberg was burnt down and two years later was captured by the Swedes. The Swedo-Danish struggles in the early 16th century came to affect the province as well, as in 1519 when the border regions were sacked by the Swedes as a vengeance for similar Danish action in V√§sterg√∂tland. The Danish civil war called the Count's Feud in 1534‚Äì36, the Northern Seven Years' War between Denmark and Sweden in 1563‚Äì1570 and the Kalmar War between Denmark and Sweden in 1611‚Äì1613 all affected Halland. One of the major battles of the Northern Seven Years' War, the battle of Axtorna, took place in Halland. After 1645 The peace stone in Br√∂msebro is not a runestone even if it looks like one. The stone was made in 1915 to commemorate the peace between Denmark and Sweden and the text is written with Latin letters. The text on the stone says \\"Memory of the peace in Br√∂msebro ‚Äì Gaspard Coignet de La.Thuilerie ‚Äì Axel Oxenstierna ‚Äì Corfitz Ulfeldt\\". The three named persons were the negotiators. Thuilerie was an ambassador from France, Oxenstierna represented Sweden and Ulfeldt represented Denmark. Halland was temporarily (for a period of 30 years) transferred to Sweden in 1645 under the terms of the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro. The conquest was later made permanent by the ceding of the province in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The last battle in Halland took place in Fyllebro on 17 August 1676, during the Scanian War. The more peaceful conditions that followed meant that the province could start to develop again. The 19th century saw the farming develop quickly to become one of the more efficient in the country by the end of the century. Parts of the province did however remain poor and erosion and blown sand remained a problem for much of the century. The county did therefore see a lot of emigration, continuing well into the 20th century. The 20th century has seen the province becoming one of the fastest growing in Sweden, as it has doubled its population since World War II. This is in part due to the northern parts, such as Kungsbacka and Onsala, more or less becoming suburbs of Gothenburg. Cities During Danish rule, privileges to towns in Halland were granted to: *Falkenberg (1558) *Halmstad (1307) *Kungsbacka (approximately 1400) *Laholm (approximately 1200) *Varberg (approximately 1100) Such privileges have no official significance nowadays.  Hundreds  Hundreds of Sweden were provincial divisions until the early 20th century, when they lost importance. Halland's hundreds were: Faur√•s Hundred, Fj√§re Hundred, Halmstad Hundred, Himle Hundred, H√∂ks Hundred, T√∂nnersj√∂ Hundred, Viske Hundred and √Örstad Hundred.  Culture  The language varieties spoken in Halland are together called hall√§ndska, though they belong to two main dialectal groups. In northern Halland a variation of the G√∂taland dialect is spoken and in the south the spoken language is a variety of Scanian.  Sights  The Varberg Fortress was built in the 13th century and improved with higher walls in the 15th century. Dukes of Halland As early as the 13th century, southern Halland was given as duchy to a branch of the Danish royal family. In the 14th century, it was given to various relatives of Danish and Swedish royal families, such as Benedict, Duke of Halland 1353‚Äì57. Since 1772 Swedish royal princes have been nominated dukes of provinces without political significance. Such a title was held by Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland (1912‚Äì1997); who was survived by his wife Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland (1976‚Äì2013). Sports Football in the province is administered by Hallands Fotbollf√∂rbund. Team handball is also popular, with HK Drott.

Origin The history of foreign migration to Athens dates back to the archaic period. Solon was said to have offered Athenian citizenship to foreigners who would relocate to his city to practice a craft.The poetics of appearance in the Attic korai, Mary Clorinda Stieber Page 134 Athenian democracy, Peter John Rhodes Page 31 (2004) However, metic status did not exist during the time of Solon. Scholars have tended to date the development of metic status to the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. However, the rate of the increase in the Athenian population in the years following 480 BC is difficult to explain by purely natural growth ‚Äì suggesting that immigrants to Athens could still become Athenians citizens at this point, and metic status did not yet exist. The first known use of the word metoikos is in Aeschylus' play Persians, first performed in 472 BC. However, James Watson argues that the word was used in Persians in a non-technical sense, meaning nothing more than \\"immigrant\\". Rebecca Futo Kennedy dates the origin of metic status in Athens to the 460s, while Watson argues that the legal status of being a metic did not develop until 451 BC ‚Äì the same year as Pericles introduced his citizenship law.  Metics in Classical Athens  One estimate of the population of Attica at the start of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC found the male metic population to be ~25,000, roughly a third of the total. The majority of metics probably came to Athens from nearby cities, seeking economic opportunities or fleeing from persecution, although there are records of immigrants from non-Greek places such as Thrace and Lydia. In other Greek cities (poleis), foreign residents were few, with the exception of cosmopolitan Corinth, of which however we do not know their legal status. In Sparta and Crete, as a general rule with few exceptions, foreigners were not allowed to stay (Xenelasia). There are also reported immigrants to the court of tyrants and kings in Thessaly, Syracuse and Macedon, whose status is decided by the ruler. Due to these complications, the legal term metic is most closely associated with Classical Athens. At Athens, the largest city in the Greek world at the time, they amounted to roughly half the free population. The status applied to two main groups of people--immigrants and former slaves. As slaves were almost always of foreign origin they can be thought of as involuntary immigrants, drawn almost exclusively from non-Greek speaking areas, while free metics were usually of Greek origin. Mostly they came from mainland Greece rather than the remote parts of the Greek world. Metics held lower social status primarily due to cultural rather than economic restraints. Some were poor artisans and ex-slaves, while others were some of the wealthiest inhabitants of the city. As citizenship was a matter of inheritance and not of place of birth, a metic could be either an immigrant or the descendant of one. Regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. From a cultural viewpoint such a resident could be completely \\"local\\" and indistinguishable from citizens. They had no role in the political community but might be completely integrated into the social and economic life of the city. In the urbane scene that opens Plato's Republic‚Äîthe dialogue takes place in a metic household‚Äîthe status of the speakers as citizen or metic is never mentioned. Metics typically shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform military service and, if wealthy enough, were subject to the special tax contributions (eisphora) and tax services (\\"liturgies\\", for example, paying for a warship or funding a tragic chorus) contributed by wealthy Athenians. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica, whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption. Neither could they sign contract with the state to work in the silver mines, since the wealth beneath the earth was felt to belong to the political community. Metics were subject to a tax called the metoikion, assessed at twelve drachmas per year for metic men and their households, and six for independent metic women.Kennedy, Rebecca Futo (2014). Immigrant Women in Athens: Gender, Ethnicity and Citizenship in the Classical City. Page 2. In addition to the metoikion, non-Athenians wishing to sell goods in the agora, including metics, seem to have been liable to another tax known as the xenika.Kennedy, Rebecca Futo (2014). Immigrant Women in Athens: Gender, Ethnicity and Citizenship in the Classical City. Page 9. Although metics were barred from the assembly and from serving as jurors, they did have the same access to the courts as citizens. They could both prosecute others and be prosecuted themselves. A great many migrants came to Athens to do business and were in fact essential to the Athenian economy. It would have been a severe disincentive if they had been unable to pursue commercial disputes under law. At the same time they did not have exactly the same rights here as citizens. Unlike citizens, metics could be made to undergo judicial torture and the penalties for killing them were not as severe as for killing a citizen. Metics were also subject to enslavement for a variety of offences. These might either be failures to abide by their status obligations, such as not paying the metoikon tax or not nominating a citizen sponsor, or they might be \\"contaminations\\" of the citizen body, marrying a citizen, or claiming to be citizens themselves. How long a foreigner could remain in Athens without counting as a metic is not known. In some other Greek cities the period was a month, and it may well have been the same at Athens. All metics there were required to register in the deme (local community) where they lived. They had to nominate a citizen as their sponsor or guardian (prostates, literally \\"one who stands on behalf of\\"). The Athenians took this last requirement very seriously. A metic without a sponsor was vulnerable to a special prosecution. If convicted, his property would be confiscated and he himself sold as a slave. For a freed slave the sponsor was automatically his former owner. This arrangement exacted some extra duties on the part of the metic, yet the child of an ex-slave metic apparently had the same status as a freeborn metic. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of \\"equal rights\\" (isoteleia) under which they were freed from the usual liabilities. In the religious sphere all metics were able to participate in the festivals central to the life of the city, except for some roles that were limited to citizens. The status divide between metic and citizen was not always clear. In the street no physical signs distinguished citizen from metic or slave. Sometimes the actual status a person had attained became a contested matter. Although local registers of citizens were kept, if one's claim to citizenship was challenged the testimony of neighbours and the community was decisive. (In Lysias 23,http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0154:speech=23:section=1 a law court speech, a man presumed to be a metic claims to be a citizen, but upon investigation‚Äînot by consulting official records but by questions asked at the cheese market‚Äîit transpires that he may well be a runaway slave, so the hostile account attests.) Metics whose family had lived in Athens for generations may have been tempted to \\"pass\\" as citizens. On a number of occasions there were purges of the citizen lists, effectively changing people who had been living as citizens into metics. In typical Athenian fashion, a person so demoted could mount a challenge in court. If however the court decided the ejected citizen was in fact a metic, he would be sent down one further rung and sold into slavery. In studying the status of the metics it is easy to gain the impression they were an oppressed minority. But by and large those who were Greek and freeborn had at least chosen to come to Athens, attracted by the prosperity of the large, dynamic, cosmopolitan city and the opportunities not available to them in their place of origin. Metics remained citizens of their cities of birth, which, like Athens, had the exclusionary ancestral view of citizenship common to ancient Greek cities. The large non- citizen community of Athens allowed ex-slave metics to become assimilated in a way not possible in more conservative and homogenised cities elsewhere. Their participation in military service, taxation (for the rich at Athens a matter of public display and pride) and cult must have given them a sense of involvement in the city, and of their value to it. Though notably, while Athenians tended to refer to metics by their name and deme of residence (the same democratic scheme used for citizens), on their tombstones freeborn metics who died in Athens preferred to name the cities from which they had come and of which they were citizens still. Aftermath The term Metic began to lose its distinctive legal status in 4th century BC, when metics were allowed to act in the court without a Prostates (patron) and came to an end in Hellenistic Athens, when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of Demetrius Phalereus in ca. 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves (Athenaeus, vi. p. 272 B). In the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a polis were called \\"paroikoi\\" (see etymology of parish), in Asia Minor \\"katoikoi\\".Encyclopedia of ancient Greece By Nigel Guy Wilson Page 470 (2006)  Modern French usage In French, \\"m√©t√®que\\" was revived as a xenophobic term for immigrants to France. This sense was popularized in the late 19th century by the nationalist writer Charles Maurras, who identified metics as one of the four primary constituents of the traitorous \\"Anti-France\\", along with Protestants, Jews, and Freemasons.L'Action fran√ßaise, 6 juillet 1912. This pejorative sense remains current in the French language, and has to some extent been reclaimed by French people of immigrant background. In 1969 the Greco-French singer Georges Moustaki recorded a song, Le M√©t√®que, which has since been covered by several artists of immigrant descent.

Local historical interest = Brewery  There seems to be some debate as to exactly when Frank Hahne came to DuBois and broke ground on his own facility. One source claims 1898, another 1897. It seems most likely that this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the DuBois Weekly Courier reported: \\"Some new developments in connection with the brewery may be looked for in the near future.\\" There were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution. By 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between DuBois Brewing and Anheuser-Busch. The DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size, ranging up to away and selling well in Buffalo, Erie and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300-barrel kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois. As with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along until 1918 and the advent of Prohibition. The brewery shifted production to \\"near beer\\" and soft drinks and opened the H&G; Ice Company. According to the April 7, 1933, DuBois Courier, the brewery won the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the 18th Amendment went into effect. As a result, DuBois Brewing Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing immediately upon the enaction of the 21st Amendment. Frank Hahne died in 1932, and the brewery was passed to his only son, Frank Hahne Jr., whose own only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967. The brewery was torn down in late 2003.  Notable people  * Thomas S.

At the 2010 census, Lock Haven's population was 9,772. Built on a site long favored by pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth through the end of the 19th century. In the 20th century, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s. The city has three sites on the National Register of Historic Places‚ÄîMemorial Park Site, a significant pre-Columbian archaeological find; Heisey House, a Victorian-era museum; and Water Street District, an area with a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture. A levee, completed in 1995, protects the city from further flooding. While industry remains important to the city, about a third of Lock Haven's workforce is employed in education, health care, or social services.  History = Pre-European  The earliest settlers in Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000 BCE and 8000 BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding. Fluted point spearheads from this era, known as the Paleo-Indian Period, have been found in most parts of the state. Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000 years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE. First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.At the time of first contact, several tribes lived in what later became Pennsylvania. It is not known which tribe made first contact with Europeans.  Eighteenth century  In the early 18th century, a tribal confederacy known as the Six Nations of the Iroquois, headquartered in New York, ruled the Indian (Native American) tribes of Pennsylvania, including those who lived near what would become Lock Haven. Indian settlements in the area included three Munsee villages on the Great Island in the West Branch Susquehanna River at the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek. Four Indian trails, the Great Island Path, the Great Shamokin Path, the Bald Eagle Creek Path, and the Sinnemahoning Path, crossed the island, and a fifth, Logan's Path, met Bald Eagle Creek Path a few miles upstream near the mouth of Fishing Creek. During the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì63), colonial militiamen on the Kittanning Expedition destroyed Munsee property on the Great Island and along the West Branch. By 1763, the Munsee had abandoned their island villages and other villages in the area.The earliest recorded inhabitants of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were the Susquehannocks, but they were wiped out by disease and warfare with the Iroquois, and the few members left moved west or were assimilated into other tribes by 1675. After that the Iroquois, who were the nominal rulers of the land but mostly lived in New York to the north, invited tribes displaced by European settlers to move into the region. These included the Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, and others. Generally, they moved west into the Ohio River Valley. For more information see Wallace, Paul A.W. (2005).

Retrieved on December 21, 2009. Map of fortifications and streams in north-central Pennsylvania during the Big Runaway. Modern county borders are shown for orientation. With the signing of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, the British gained control from the Iroquois of lands south of the West Branch. However, white settlers continued to appropriate land, including tracts in and near the future site of Lock Haven, not covered by the treaty. In 1769, Cleary Campbell, the first white settler in the area, built a log cabin near the present site of Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, and by 1773 William Reed, another settler, had built a cabin surrounded by a stockade and called it Reed's Fort. It was the westernmost of 11 mostly primitive forts along the West Branch; Fort Augusta, located by the confluence of the East (or North) and West branches of the Susquehanna at what is now Sunbury, was the easternmost and most defensible. In response to settler incursions, and encouraged by the British during the American Revolution (1775‚Äì83), Indians attacked colonists and their settlements along the West Branch. Fort Reed and the other white settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in 1778 during a general evacuation known as the Big Runaway. Hundreds of people fled along the river to Fort Augusta, about from Fort Reed; some did not return for five years. In 1784, the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix, between the Iroquois and the United States, transferred most of the remaining Indian territory in Pennsylvania, including what would become Lock Haven, to the state. The U.S. acquired the last remaining tract, the Erie Triangle, through a separate treaty and sold it to Pennsylvania in 1792.  Nineteenth century  Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when Clinton County was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19th century largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally for such things as frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before the founding of the town, the lumber industry was well established. alt=A stone and metal monument and stone retaining walls commemorate a former canal lock. A sidewalk runs by the memorial and between the retaining walls on a lush bed of grass. The West Branch Canal, which opened in 1834, ran from Northumberland to Farrandsville, about upstream from Lock Haven. A state-funded extension called the Bald Eagle Cut ran from the West Branch through Lock Haven and Flemington to Bald Eagle Creek. A privately funded extension, the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation, eventually reached Bellefonte, upstream. Lock Haven's founder, Jeremiah Church, and his brother, Willard, chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river, the creek, and the canal. Church named the town Lock Haven because it had a canal lock and because it was a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers. Over the next quarter century, canal boats wide and long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as coal, ashes for lye and soap, firewood, food, furniture, dry goods, and clothing. A rapid increase in Lock Haven's population (to 830 by 1850) followed the opening of the canal. A Lock Haven log boom, smaller than but otherwise similar to the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the Dunnstown Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about from one another, stretched in a line from the dam to a point upriver. Connected by timbers shackled together with iron yokes and rings, the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs. Workers called boom rats sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products. The Sunbury and Erie Railroad, renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861, reached Lock Haven in 1859, and with it came a building boom. Hoping that the area's coal, iron ore, white pine, and high-quality clay would produce significant future wealth, railroad investors led by Christopher and John Fallon financed a line to Lock Haven. On the strength of the railroad's potential value to the city, local residents had invested heavily in housing, building large homes between 1854 and 1856. Although the Fallons' coal and iron ventures failed, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Italianate mansions and commercial buildings such as the Fallon House, a large hotel, remained, and the railroad provided a new mode of transport for the ongoing timber era. A second rail line, the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad, originally organized as the Tyrone and Lock Haven Railroad and completed in the 1860s, linked Lock Haven to Tyrone, to the southwest. The two rail lines soon became part of the network controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad. alt=Several rafts made of long logs lashed together are bunched together near the bank of a large river. A row of houses lines the river bank, at the bottom of hill paralleling the river. Two men are standing on one of the rafts. During the era of log floating, logjams sometimes occurred when logs struck an obstacle. Log rafts floating down the West Branch had to pass through chutes in canal dams. The rafts were commonly wide‚Äînarrow enough to pass through the chutes‚Äîand to long. In 1874, a large raft got wedged in the chute of the Dunnstown Dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank with a pile of logs high. The jam eventually trapped another 200 log rafts, and 2 canal boats, The Mammoth of Newport and The Sarah Dunbar. In terms of board feet, the peak of the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs produced a total of about (533,000 m3) of sawed lumber. After that, production steadily declined throughout the state. Lock Haven's timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889. The Central State Normal School, established to train teachers for central Pennsylvania, held its first classes in 1877 at a site overlooking the West Branch Susquehanna River. The small school, with enrollments below 150 until the 1940s, eventually became Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. In the early 1880s, the New York and Pennsylvania Paper Mill in Castanea Township near Flemington began paper production on the site of a former sawmill; the paper mill remained a large employer until the end of the 20th century.  Twentieth century  Bird's-eye view from a postcard sent in 1911. Bald Eagle Creek is in the foreground and the West Branch Susquehanna River is in the background. As older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and Mill Hall, about to the west. The trolley line extended from the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad station in Lock Haven to a station of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven's downtown, close to the Normal School, across town to the trolley car barn on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and Nittany Valley Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, south of Mill Hall, and to Avis northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930. alt=A white van is parked in front of a rectangular three-story building with many windows. A sign on the building says, \\"Piper Aviation Museum\\". William T. Piper, Sr., built the Piper Aircraft Corporation factory in Lock Haven in 1937 after the company's Taylor Aircraft manufacturing plant in Bradford, Pennsylvania, was destroyed by fire. The factory began operations in a building that once housed a silk mill. As the company grew, the original factory expanded to include engineering and office buildings. Piper remained in the city until 1984, when its new owner, Lear-Siegler, moved production to Vero Beach, Florida. The Clinton County Historical Society opened the Piper Aviation Museum at the site of the former factory in 1985, and 10 years later the museum became an independent organization. The state of Pennsylvania acquired Central State Normal School in 1915 and renamed it Lock Haven State Teachers College in 1927. Between 1942 and 1970, the student population grew from 146 to more than 2,300; the number of teaching faculty rose from 25 to 170, and the college carried out a large building program. The school's name was changed to Lock Haven State College in 1960, and its emphasis shifted to include the humanities, fine arts, mathematics, and social sciences, as well as teacher education. Becoming Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania in 1983, it opened a branch campus in Clearfield, west of Lock Haven, in 1989. An industrial area in Castanea Township adjacent to Lock Haven was placed on the National Priorities List of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites (commonly referred to as Superfund sites) in 1982. Drake Chemical, which went bankrupt in 1981, made ingredients for pesticides and other compounds at the site from the 1960s to 1981. Starting in 1982, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began a clean-up of contaminated containers, buildings, and soils at the site and by the late 1990s had replaced the soils. Equipment to treat contaminated groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate.  Floods  alt=A large, smooth river crossed by a modern bridge. The left bank is tree lined, the right is a levee, a long mountain ridge is in the background. Pennsylvania's streams have frequently flooded. According to William H. Shank, the Native Americans of Pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers every 14 years. Shank tested this idea by tabulating the highest floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 200-year period and found that a major flood had occurred, on average, once every 25 years between 1784 and 1972. Big floods recorded at Harrisburg, on the main stem of the Susquehanna about downstream from Lock Haven, occurred in 1784, 1865, 1889, 1894, 1902, 1936, and 1972. Readings from the Williamsport stream gauge, below Lock Haven on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, showed major flooding between 1889 and 1972 in the same years as the Harrisburg station; in addition, a large flood occurred on the West Branch at Williamsport in 1946. Estimated flood-crest readings between 1847 and 1979‚Äîbased on data from the National Weather Service flood gauge at Lock Haven‚Äîshow that flooding likely occurred in the city 19 times in 132 years. The biggest flood occurred on March 18, 1936, when the river crested at , which was about above the flood stage of . The third biggest flood, cresting at in Lock Haven, occurred on June 1, 1889, and coincided with the Johnstown Flood. The flood demolished Lock Haven's log boom, and millions of feet of stored timber were swept away. The flood damaged the canals, which were subsequently abandoned, and destroyed the last of the canal boats based in the city. alt=A color-coded chart shows that Hurricane Agnes began as a tropical depression over the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico, turned sharply northward and became a tropical storm after entering the Caribbean Sea. It gained hurricane strength as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico but weakened to a tropical depression again after striking the U.S. mainland and turning to the northeast. After crossing several southeastern states, it entered the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of North Carolina and regained tropical-storm strength. It then curved back to the northwest and, striking the mainland again, it passed close to Pennsylvania. The most damaging Lock Haven flood was caused by the remnants of Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The storm, just below hurricane strength when it reached the region, made landfall on June 22 near New York City. Agnes merged with a non-tropical low on June 23, and the combined system affected the northeastern United States until June 25. The combination produced widespread rains of with local amounts up to in western Schuylkill County, about southeast of Lock Haven. At Lock Haven, the river crested on June 23 at , second only to the 1936 crest. The flood greatly damaged the paper mill and Piper Aircraft. In 1992 federal, state, and local governments began construction of barriers to protect the city. The project included a levee of and a flood wall of along the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek, closure structures, retention basins, a pumping station, and some relocation of roads and buildings. Completed in 1995, the levee protected the city from high water in the year of the Blizzard of 1996, and again 2004, when rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan threatened the city. Geography Lock Haven is the county seat of Clinton County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land. About , 6 percent, is water. alt=A highway runs toward a bridge between an ornate building with a clock tower and a plain three-story red brick building. A forested hill rises on the far side of the bridge, which is decorated with U.S. flags on poles. A double highway sign along the road indicates that Highway 120 turns to the left (west) before the bridge and that Highway 664 continues across the bridge and heads generally north. Several cars are moving along the highway and over the bridge. Lock Haven is at above sea level near the confluence of Bald Eagle Creek and the West Branch Susquehanna River in north-central Pennsylvania. The city is about by highway northwest of Philadelphia and northeast of Pittsburgh. U.S. Route 220, a major transportation corridor, skirts the city on its south edge, intersecting with Pennsylvania Route 120, which passes through the city and connects it with Renovo in northern Clinton County. Other highways entering Lock Haven include Pennsylvania Route 664 and Pennsylvania Route 150, which connects to Avis. The city and nearby smaller communities‚ÄîCastanea, Dunnstown, Flemington, and Mill Hall‚Äîare mainly at valley level in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, a mountain belt characterized by long even valleys running between long continuous ridges. Bald Eagle Mountain, one of these ridges, runs parallel to Bald Eagle Creek on the south side of the city. Upstream of the confluence with Bald Eagle Creek, the West Branch Susquehanna River drains part of the Allegheny Plateau, a region of dissected highlands (also called the \\"Deep Valleys Section\\") generally north of the city. The geologic formations in the southeastern part of the city are mostly limestone, while those to the north and west consist mostly of siltstone and shale. Large parts of the city are flat, but slopes rise to the west, and very steep slopes are found along the river, on the university campus, and along Pennsylvania Route 120 as it approaches U.S. Route 220.

Annual snowfall amounts between 1888 and 1996 varied from 0 in several years to about in 1942. The maximum recorded snowfall in a single month was in April 1894.  Demographics  As of the census of 2010, there were 9,772 people living in 3,624 housing units spread across the city. The average household size during the years 2009‚Äì13 was 2.38. During those same years, multi-unit structures made up 57 percent of the housing-unit total. The rate of home ownership was 35 percent, and the median value of owner-occupied units was about $100,000. The estimated population of the city in 2013 was 10,025, an increase of 2.6 percent after 2010. The population density in 2010 was 3,915 people per square mile (1,506 per km2).

Lock Haven's economy, from the city's founding in 1833 until the end of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth. By 1900, the lumber industry had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, maker of the Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment rate of more than 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.

In 1900, 4,082 people lived there, and in 1910, 4,621 lived there, but in the 2010 census the borough population was 1,228. The borough is located on the West Branch Susquehanna River, and along Pennsylvania's Bucktail State Park Natural Area, centered on Pennsylvania Route 120, which winds through the surrounding mountains following the river. The town is the home of the \\"Flaming Foliage Festival\\" held each October, generally on the second weekend, celebrating the fall colors of the trees on the area's many mountains. The festival includes a parade and the crowning of a queen, usually chosen from one of the nearby high schools. The festival serves as a \\"homecoming\\" event for former residents of Renovo, many of whom return annually for the event. Various vendors from the surrounding areas sell food, clothing, and an array of novelties, memorabilia, and souvenirs. The economy of Renovo and the surrounding area were primarily based on lumbering, until the first-growth forest was almost entirely stripped away, and the industry collapsed. There are also deposits of bituminous coal and fire clay in the region. History Renovo was built for and by the Philadelphia & Erie Railroad as the midpoint between Philadelphia and Erie. The town was laid out on a mostly-flat flood plain along the West Branch of the Susquehanna River in North-Central Pennsylvania, and was incorporated in 1866. Many of the buildings of what became the sprawling Railroad Shops complex were built before, during, and after the American Civil War. The Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, along with many other relatively smaller lines eventually became incorporated into the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest corporation in the world with an annual GPO larger than the federal government, and is the only corporation in history to have paid out dividends due to its profitability for 100 years. Unlike most \\"rural\\" towns and residential areas, Renovo was laid out in an industrially-oriented urban grid with avenues given names of the Great Lakes, and \\"side streets\\" numbered from 1 to 16. Houses were mostly built close to one another or incorporated into row houses. Houses with larger lots allowing for big yards were a rare luxury. Before the town was completely built out, Renovo was known and advertised as a \\"resort town in the mountains.\\" One can still find newspaper ads and brochures extolling the restorative mountain air, clean water, and outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting. There were several large hotels in the town well before the turn of the 20th century. The railroad made access to this remote area seemingly quick and effortless for those living in other cities which enjoyed railroad service. The town boasted dozens of bars and restaurants as well as fine churches which gave testimony to the forward-directed, optimistic, and vigorous energy which fueled the town's growth and development. Most institutions which one would find in a town of the era or today, such as a hospital, YMCA, schools, taxi service, shops, clubs, lodges, fraternal organizations, professional services, and sports teams, were established. The major employer was the Pennsylvania Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad Shops. As long as the railroad prospered, the town was a bustling center of activity. Some aspects of railroad business began to decrease as early as before World War II, but business surged back strongly during the War. However, further decline in demand for both passenger and freight transportation via the railroad came with the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the building of the Interstate Highway System, the surge of automobile ownership and use, and the consolidation of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Shop facilities to other locations such as Pittsburgh and Altoona. The closing of the shops in the 1960s tolled the death knell for Renovo as an enterprising town with a future. Its present population is less than 2,000; it was once around 5,000. Many residents drive the two-lane, windy roads and I-80 to other towns for employment. There is also a substantial contingent of lifelong residents and transplants who are retired. The change in human activity over the years hasn't dimmed or substantially altered the natural environment of this Allegheny Mountain area of the larger Appalachian Highlands. Geography Renovo is located in north-central Clinton County at (41.327669, -77.749580), along the West Branch Susquehanna River, at the bottom of a gorge.

The population was 932 at the 2010 census. History Catawissa Township is the oldest municipality in Columbia County. It was first formed in 1785 from parts of Augusta Township. When first formed, Catawissa Township stretched from Montour County in the west to western Schuylkill County in the east. The creations of Roaring Creek Township, Franklin Township, and Main Township in 1832, 1843, and 1844 respectively, reduced the size of Catawissa Township significantly. The first Native Americans to settle in the vicinity of the township were the Piscatawese, Conoys, or Gangawese, who built a wigwam in Catawissa. The first house in Catawissa Township was built in 1774 by Moses Roberts. By the mid to late 1770s, Quakers had arrived in the township. More settlers arrived in Catawissa Township in 1782. The same year, a group of Native Americans arrived in the area to re-establish a wigwam. This led to strife between them and the settlers, and several murders occurred. In 1833, there were two furnaces and two forges within the boundaries of Catawissa Township as it was at that time. The Hollingshead Covered Bridge No. 40 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Geography Scenery of Catawissa Township Catawissa Township is located southwest of the center of Columbia County, across the Susquehanna River from Bloomsburg, the county seat. The township is bordered to the north and northwest by the Susquehanna, to the west by the borough of Catawissa, to the southwest by Franklin Township, to the south by Cleveland and Locust townships, and to the east by Main Township. Catawissa Mountain, elevation , occupies the southeastern part of the township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.01%, is water. Catawissa Creek flows east to west across the center of the township, entering Catawissa borough before emptying into the Susquehanna River. Geology Iron ore is abundant in Catawissa Township. The soil in the township consists of clay and gravel. The terrain in the township is predominantly hilly. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 944 people, 378 households, and 297 families residing in the township. The population density was 75.8 people per square mile (29.3/km).

Its population has dwindled from more than 1,000 residents in 1980 to 63 by 1990, to only five in 2017‚Äîa result of the coal mine fire which has been burning beneath the borough since 1962. Centralia, which is part of the Bloomsburg‚ÄìBerwick metropolitan area, is the least-populated municipality in Pennsylvania. It is completely surrounded by Conyngham Township. All real estate in the borough was claimed under eminent domain in 1992 and condemned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Centralia's ZIP code was discontinued by the Postal Service in 2002. State and local officials reached an agreement with the seven remaining residents on October 29, 2013, allowing them to live out their lives there, after which the rights to their houses will be taken through eminent domain. History=Early history Many of the Native American tribes in what is now Columbia County sold the land that makes up Centralia to colonial agents in 1749 for the sum of ¬£500. In 1770, during the construction of the Reading Road, which stretched from Reading to Fort Augusta (present-day Sunbury), settlers surveyed and explored the land. A large portion of the Reading Road was developed later as Route 61, the main highway east into and south out of Centralia. In 1793, Robert Morris, a hero of the Revolutionary War and a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, acquired a third of Centralia's valley land. When he declared bankruptcy in 1798, the land was surrendered to the Bank of the United States. A French sea captain named Stephen Girard purchased Morris' lands for $30,000, including 68 tracts east of Morris'. He had learned that there was anthracite coal in the region. The Centralia coal deposits were largely overlooked before the construction of the Mine Run Railroad in 1854. In 1832, Johnathan Faust opened the Bull's Head Tavern in what was called Roaring Creek Township; this gave the town its first name, Bull's Head. In 1842, Centralia's land was bought by the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Alexander Rae, a mining engineer, moved his family in and began planning a village, laying out streets and lots for development. Rae named the town Centreville, but in 1865 changed it to Centralia because the U.S. Post Office already had a Centreville in Schuylkill County. The Mine Run Railroad was built in 1854 to transport coal out of the valley.  Mining begins  220px The first two mines in Centralia opened in 1856, the Locust Run Mine and the Coal Ridge Mine. Afterward came the Hazeldell Colliery Mine in 1860, the Centralia Mine in 1862, and the Continental Mine in 1863. The Continental was located on Stephen Girard's former estate. Branching from the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad was constructed to Centralia in 1865; it enabled transport and expansion of Centralia's coal sales to markets in eastern Pennsylvania. Centralia was incorporated as a borough in 1866. Its principal employer was the anthracite coal industry. Alexander Rae, the town's founder, was murdered in his buggy by members of the Molly Maguires on October 17, 1868, during a trip between Centralia and Mount Carmel. Three men were eventually convicted of his death and were hanged in the county seat of Bloomsburg, on March 25, 1878. Several other murders and incidents of arson also took place during the violence, as Centralia was a hotbed of Molly Maguires activity during the 1860s to organize a mineworkers union in order to improve wages and working conditions. A legend among locals in Centralia tells that Father Daniel Ignatius McDermott, the first Roman Catholic priest to call Centralia home, cursed the land in retaliation for being assaulted by three members of the Maguires in 1869. McDermott said that there would be a day when St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church would be the only structure remaining in Centralia. Many of the Molly Maguires' leaders were hanged in 1877, ending their crimes. Legends say that a number of descendants of the Molly Maguires still lived in Centralia up until the 1980s. According to numbers of Federal census records, the town of Centralia reached its maximum population of 2,761 in 1890. At its peak, the town had seven churches, five hotels, 27 saloons, two theaters, a bank, a post office, and 14 general and grocery stores. Thirty-seven years later the production of anthracite coal had reached its peak in Pennsylvania. In the following years, production declined, as many young miners from Centralia enlisted in the military when the US entered World War I. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 resulted in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company closing five of its Centralia-local mines. Bootleg miners continued mining in several idle mines, using techniques such as what was called \\"pillar-robbing,\\" where miners would extract coal from coal pillars left in mines to support their roofs. This caused the collapse of many idle mines, further complicating the prevention of the mine fire in 1962. Efforts to seal off the abandoned mines ran into the collapsed areas. In 1950, Centralia Council acquired the rights to all anthracite coal beneath Centralia through a state law passed in 1949 that enabled the transaction. That year, the federal census counted 1,986 residents in Centralia. Coal mining continued in Centralia until the 1960s, when most of the companies shut down. Bootleg mining continued until 1982, and strip and open-pit mining are still active in the area. An underground mine about three miles to the west employs about 40 people. Centralia area showing conditions before mine fire Rail service ended in 1966. Centralia operated its own school district, including elementary schools and a high school. There were also two Catholic parochial schools. By 1980, it had 1,012 residents. Another 500 or 600 lived nearby.  Mine fire  A small part of the Centralia mine fire as it appeared after being exposed during an excavation in 1969 =Triggers= Analysts disagree about the specific cause of the Centralia fire. David Dekok, author of Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire, concluded that it started with an attempt to clean up the town landfill. In May 1962, the Centralia Borough Council hired five members of the volunteer fire company to clean up the town landfill, located in an abandoned strip-mine pit next to the Odd Fellows Cemetery just outside the borough limits. This had been done prior to Memorial Day in previous years, when the landfill was in a different location. On May 27, 1962, the firefighters, as they had in the past, set the dump on fire and let it burn for some time. Unlike in previous years, however, the fire was not fully extinguished. An unsealed opening in the pit allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia.David Dekok, 'Unseen Danger and successor edition, Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire By contrast, other sources claim that the fire had started the previous day, when a trash hauler dumped hot ash or coal discarded from coal burners into the open trash pit. The author of The Day the Earth Caved In noted that borough council minutes from June 4, 1962, referred to two fires at the dump and that five firefighters had submitted bills for \\"fighting the fire at the landfill area.\\" The borough, by law, was responsible for installing a fire-resistant clay barrier between each layer of the landfill, but fell behind schedule, leaving the barrier incomplete. This allowed the hot coals to penetrate the vein of coal underneath the pit and start the subsequent subterranean fire. Another theory proposes that the Bast Colliery fire of 1932 was never fully extinguished, and that fire reached the landfill area by 1962; however, a miner named Frank Jurgill Sr. disputes that theory. Jurgill claims he operated a bootleg mine with his brother near the landfill from 1960 to 1962. If the Bast Colliery fire had not been extinguished, the brothers would likely have been overcome or killed by the noxious gases via many interconnected tunnels in the area. =Immediate effects= In 1979, locals became aware of the scale of the problem when a gas-station owner, then-mayor John Coddington, inserted a dipstick into one of his underground tanks to check the fuel level. When he withdrew it, it seemed hot. He lowered a thermometer into the tank on a string and was shocked to discover that the temperature of the gasoline in the tank was . Statewide attention to the fire began to increase, culminating in 1981 when a 12-year-old resident named Todd Domboski fell into a sinkhole, wide by deep, that suddenly opened beneath his feet in a backyard. His cousin, 14-year-old Eric Wolfgang, pulled Domboski out of the hole and saved his life. The plume of hot steam billowing from the hole was tested and found to contain a lethal level of carbon monoxide. Although there was physical, visible evidence of the fire, residents of Centralia were bitterly divided over the question of whether or not the fire posed a direct threat to the town. In The Real Disaster is Above Ground, Steve Kroll-Smith and Steve Couch identified at least six community groups, each organized around varying interpretations of the amount and kind of risk posed by the fire. In 1983, the U.S. Congress allocated more than $42 million for relocation efforts. Nearly all of the residents accepted the government's buyout offers. More than 1,000 people moved out of the town and 500 structures were demolished. By 1990, the census recorded 63 remaining residents. In 1992, Pennsylvania governor Bob Casey invoked eminent domain on all property in the borough, condemning all the buildings within. A subsequent legal effort by residents to overturn the action failed. In 2002, the U.S. Postal Service discontinued Centralia's ZIP code, 17927. Only 16 homes were still standing by 2006, which was reduced to eleven by 2009 when Governor Ed Rendell began the formal eviction of the remaining Centralia residents. Only five homes remained by 2010. The Centralia mine fire extended beneath the village of Byrnesville, a short distance to the south, and required it also to be abandoned. Condemnation and abandonment Toxic gas and smoke rising from the ground above the underground fire in 2006 1999 photo showing the abandoned highway and its replacement Few homes remain standing in Centralia. Most of the abandoned buildings have been demolished by the Columbia County Redevelopment Authority or reclaimed by nature. At a casual glance, the area now appears to be a field with many paved streets running through it. Some areas are being filled with new-growth forest. The remaining church in the borough, St. Mary's, holds weekly services on Sunday. It has not yet been directly affected by the fire. The town's four cemeteries--including one on the hilltop that has smoke rising around and out of it--are maintained in good condition. The only indications of the fire, which underlies some spreading along four fronts, are low round metal steam vents in the south of the borough. Several signs warn of underground fire, unstable ground, and dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Additional smoke and steam can be seen coming from an abandoned portion of Pennsylvania Route 61, the area just behind the hilltop cemetery, and other cracks in the ground scattered about the area. Route 61 was repaired several times until it was closed. The current route was formerly a detour around the damaged portion during the repairs and became a permanent route in 1993; mounds of dirt were placed at both ends of the former route, effectively blocking the road. Pedestrian traffic is still possible due to a small opening about two feet wide at the north side of the road. The underground fire is still burning and may continue to do so for 250 years. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not renew the relocation contract at the end of 2005.Reading Eagle, January 3, 2006 The last remaining house on Locust Avenue was demolished in September 2007. It was notable for a period for the five chimney-like support buttresses along each of two opposite sides of the house. The house had formerly been supported by a row of adjacent buildings. Another house with similar buttresses was visible from the northern side of the cemetery, just north of the burning, partially subsumed hillside. Residents John Comarnisky and John Lokitis, Jr. were evicted in May and July 2009, respectively. In May 2009, the remaining residents mounted another legal effort to reverse the 1992 eminent domain claim.\\"Few remain as 1962 Pa. coal town fire still burns,\\" Yahoo News, February 5, 2010 In 2010, only five homes remained as state officials tried to vacate the remaining residents and demolish what was left of the town. In March 2011, a federal judge refused to issue an injunction that would have stopped the condemnation. The Borough Council still had regular meetings . It was reported that the town's highest bill at the meeting reported on came from PPL, a power utility, at $92 and the town's budget was \\"in the black.\\" In February 2012, the Commonwealth Court ruled that a declaration of taking could not be re-opened or set aside on the basis that the purpose for the condemnation no longer exists; seven people, including the Borough Council president, had filed suit claiming the condemnation was no longer needed because the underground fire had moved and the air quality in the borough was the same as that in Lancaster. In October 2013, the remaining residents settled their lawsuit, receiving $218,000 in compensation for the value of their homes, along with $131,500 to settle additional claims, and the right to stay in their homes for the rest of their lives. Time capsule The town's residents and former residents decided to open a time capsule buried in 1866 a few years earlier than planned after someone had attempted to unearth and steal the capsule in May 2014. The capsule was not scheduled to be opened until 2016 (150 years). Items found in the footlocker-sized capsule, which had been inundated with about of water, included a miner's helmet, a miner's lamp, some coal, a Bible, local souvenirs, and a pair of bloomers signed by the men of Centralia in 1866. Mineral rights Several current and former Centralia residents believe the state's eminent domain claim was a plot to gain the mineral rights to the anthracite coal beneath the borough. Residents have asserted its value to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact amount of coal is not known.This is stated in Joan Quigley's The Day the Earth Caved In in a section that indicated that Centralia is the only municipality within the Commonwealth that owned its mineral rights. This theory is based on the municipality laws of the state. According to state law, when the municipality can no longer form a functioning municipal government, i.e., when there are no longer any residents, the borough legally ceases to exist. At that point, the mineral rights, which are owned by the Borough of Centralia (they are not privately held) would revert to the ownership of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Demographics=2000 census As of the census of 2000, there were 21 people, 10 households, and 7 families residing in the borough. The population density was 87.5 people per square mile (3.38 km¬≤). There were 16 housing units at an average density of 66.7 people per square mile (2.57 km¬≤). The racial makeup of the borough was 100% white. There were 10 households, out of which 1 (10%) had children under the age of 18 living with them, 5 (50%) were married couples living together, 1 had a female householder with no partner present, and 3 (30%) were non-families. 3 of the households were made up of individuals, and 1 had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10, and the average family size was 2.57. In the borough the population was spread out, with 1 resident under the age of 18, 1 from 18 to 24, 4 from 25 to 44, 7 from 45 to 64, and 8 who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 62 years. There were 10 females and 11 males with 1 male under the age of 18. The median income for a household in the borough was $23,750, and the median income for a family was $28,750. The per capita income for the borough was $16,083. None of the population was below the poverty line. 2010 census As of the census of 2010 there were 10 people (down 52% since 2000), 5 households (down 50%), and 3 families (down 57%) residing in the borough. The population density was 42 people per square mile (16/km¬≤) (down 52%). There were 6 housing units (down 62.5%) at an average density of 0.4 units per square mile (.015 units/km¬≤). The racial makeup of the borough was 100% white. Of the five households, none had children under the age of 18. Two (40%) were married couples living together, one (20%) had a female householder with no spouse present, and two (40%) were non-families. One of those non-family households was an individual, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.0 persons, and the average family size was 2.33 persons. There were no residents under the age of 18, one aged 25‚Äì29, one aged 50‚Äì54, one aged 55‚Äì59, four aged 60‚Äì64, two aged 70‚Äì74, and one aged 80‚Äì84. The median age was 62.5 years, and there were five females and five males in total. Public services Fire engine inside municipal building The borough is served by a small group of volunteer firefighters operating one fire engine that is more than 30 years old. The fire company ambulance was given to the nearby Wilburton Fire Company in Conyngham Township in 2012. The Centralia Municipal Building still stands, along with its attached fire station garage. By the early 2010s, the building had fallen into disrepair, but new siding was installed in 2012. The building hosts the annual Centralia Cleanup Day, when volunteers collect illegally dumped trash in the area. Although past cleanup days avoided fire-impacted areas, the 2018 cleanup included areas around the landfill and the abandoned section of PA Route 61, since nicknamed the Graffiti Highway. The town's Ukrainian Catholic church remains in use and attracts worshippers from surrounding towns including people who were once residents of the town. A geological survey found there was solid rock, not coal, under the church so it is not in danger of collapse due to the fire. In popular culture Road damage and graffiti on abandoned section of PA Route 61 Abandoned section of Railroad Avenue in Centralia, 2016 Centralia has been used as a model for many different fictional ghost towns and manifestations of Hell. Prominent examples include Dean Koontz's Strange Highways and David Wellington's Vampire Zero. Screenwriter Roger Avary researched Centralia while working on the screenplay for the Silent Hill film adaptation. The 1982 PBS documentary Centralia Mine Fire contains interviews with residents and relates the story of the mine fire. The 1987 film Made in U.S.A. opens in Centralia and the surrounding coal region of Pennsylvania. The 2007 documentary The Town That Was is about the history of the town and its current and former residents. Centralia's Graffiti Highway was used as a filming location in the YouTube Horror/Mystery series, EverymanHYBRID. The episode in question was posted on November 4th, 2010. Centralia had a segment entitled \\"City on Fire\\" on the Travel Channel television series America Declassified which aired in 2013. The Centralia story was explored in the documentary segment \\"Dying Embers\\" from public radio station WNYC's Radiolab. American History comedy Podcast, The Dollop, featured an episode in 2015 discussing Centralia. Centralia is featured in season 1, episode 4 of The UnXplained on the History channel, titled \\"Unnatural Nature\\". The episode first aired on August 9, 2019. The setting of the 1991 movie \\"Nothing But Trouble\\" starring Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd was set in a fictional town \\"Valkenvania\\" based on Centralia.

Esrange Space Center was established in Kiruna in the 1960s. Also in Kiruna are the Institute of Space Physics and Lule√• University of Technology's Department of Space Science.  History = Origins  Archaeological findings have shown that the region around Kiruna has been inhabited for at least 6,000 years. Centuries before Kiruna was founded in 1900, the presence of iron ore at Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara had been known by the local Sami population. In 1696, Samuel M√∂rt, a bookkeeper of the Kengis works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills.Kummu 1997, p. 96. The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sami man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in Jukkasj√§rvi Church. Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer and mapper Anders Hackzell mapped the Kiruna area in 1736 and gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names Fredriks berg (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and Berget Ulrika Eleonora (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden Fredrik I and his wife Ulrika Eleonora. Despite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by reindeer and horses. However, the costs were high and the quality of the phosphorus ore poor, until, in 1878, the Gilchrist-Thomas process, invented by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Gilchrist, allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore. An Iore-hauled train passing Vassijaure In 1884, a concession for a railway from Lule√• to Narvik was granted to The Northern Europe Railway Company. The provisional railway between Lule√• and Malmberget was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million Swedish crowns, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to G√§llivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at Malmberget by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmf√§lt (AGM). At the initiative of Robert Schoug, the Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing Malmbanan via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to Narvik was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of Russia (then controlling Finland and already connected to Sweden at Haparanda‚ÄìTornio) on an international railway line. Kiruna City Hall in summer The decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. King Oscar II only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north. The architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman's plan was officially accepted. Gustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements Kiruna, a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish speaking inhabitants. The name means rock ptarmigan in Sami and Finnish. LKAB appointed Hjalmar Lundbohm, who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.  Early history  Population development in Kiruna town Aurora taken from the suburb of Kiruna Before the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal slums similar to those in the other mining town, Malmberget, south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, B:1, is preserved and can be seen at Hjalmar Lundbohmsg√•rden. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon- to-be Kiruna. This increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930. The residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamh√§lle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetaref√∂rening, that had hoped for status as k√∂ping, which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest's home. Kiruna Church In April 1907, a tram began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: bergbanan (funicular), stadssp√•rv√§gen (city tramway) and gruvsp√•rv√§gen (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of and was unique due to the 1-meter gauge, double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden. The iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, mountaintop removal mining was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using steam powered excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of Kiirunavaara, Statsr√•det, was above Luossaj√§rvi until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910. A general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in Latin America was not what they had hoped it to be, Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants. During World War I, iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB's history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the fabulous twenties, it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927. In 1921, mining started at Kiruna's other hill, Luossavaara. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in open pit mining here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine. While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Luossavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Luossavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.Hansson 2015, p. 212. During the first decades of Kiruna's existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the Torne and Kalix rivers to Jukkasj√§rvi and H√•moj√•kk and then proceed by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkij√§rvi in 1909, Alttaj√§rvi in 1913 and connected to Svappavaara in 1926, from where roads already connected via Vittangi to Pajala and via Lappesuando to G√§llivare and further south. The Great Depression led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of World War II. Although some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna's existence.  World War II  The municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German invasion of Poland, then in November 1939 after the Russian invasion of Finland, but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in Operation Catherine. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined. After the German invasion of Norway, at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along Malmbanan, to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the Sami, military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgr√§nsen. After the battle at Bj√∏rnfjell, 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna. Despite the conditions for Swedish neutrality, rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bj√∏rnfjell. Swedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, Ernst Wollweber and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3¬Ω years in prison. Upon his release, he founded Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies. Germany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to transitering av human karakt√§r, men ej underh√•ll till stridande trupp (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches. During the war, up to 2000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossaj√§rvi lake, next to the railway stop. North of Tornetr√§sk, at Kaivare, a radio base Kari was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.  Post-war  An old mansion near Kiruna centrum In 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as Lombolo was built in the 1960s. After World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, Norrlandsfonden was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods. On 10 November 1960, Kiruna Airport opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at Luossaj√§rvi since World War I. A road to Nikkaluokta was opened in 1971 and to Riksgr√§nsen and Narvik in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of Tornetr√§sk, via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, Salmi to Innset and Bardu in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25 km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmav√§gen, is not connected to any other road. Increased communications were also beneficial for tourism. Swedish Railways had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between Gothenburg and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the United States. The canoe club Kiruna L√•ngf√§rdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasj√§rvi. In 1990, the first Icehotel was built in Jukkasj√§rvi and advertised as the world's largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of Malmbanan 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish Viking satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna. In 1957, the Kiruna Geophysical Observatory (KGO) (now the Swedish Institute of Space Physics) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Esrange Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the Swedish Defence Material Administration). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmaj√§rvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, Ume√• University started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and GIS education was started by Lule√• University of Technology in 1991. In 1993, The Ume√• space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Lule√• University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Lule√• University of Technology, remained, while the Ume√• University programme in Space Engineering quit. ice hotel in Jukkasj√§rvi The Kiruna Icehotel has been built in Jukkasj√§rvi each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.  Moving the town  The re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by LKAB, undermines the current town center. Several buildings are to be moved or demolished. The town center is to be moved 3 kilometers to the east. In 2004, it was decided that the present centre of the municipality would have to be relocated to counter mining-related subsidence. The relocation would be made gradually over the coming decade. On January 8, 2007, a new location was proposed, northwest to the foot of the Luossavaara mountain, by the lake of Luossaj√§rvi. The first actual work on moving the town was done in November 2007, when work on the new main sewage pipe started. In the same week, first sketches for the layout of the new part of the town became available. The sketches include a travel centre, the new locations for the city hall and the church, an artificial lake and an extension of the Luossavaara hill into the city.Skissf√∂rslag nov.-07 The location of the new section of the E10 is still uncertain, as is the location of the railway and the railway station. A more official sketch was published early in spring 2008, which was then discussed with various interest groups before a further version is to be produced. In June 2010 the municipal council decided that the town would be moved eastwards (to ), in the direction of Tuolluvaara, instead of the proposed northwestern location. The moving of the town was started in 2014 and the plan describes a process that continues to 2100. The years 2012-2013 an international architectural competition concerning the vision, strategy and design of a new city centre for a new Kiruna was arranged by the Municipality of Kiruna in partnership with the Swedish Association of Architects. White Arkitekter AB based in Stockholm togheter with Ghilardi + Hellsten Arkitekter based in Oslo, SPACECAPE AB, VECTURA CONSULTING AB and EVIDENS BLW AB won the competition with their masterplan and strategy for moving the city. The competition team was led by White Arkitekter AB, Lead Architect Mikael Stenqvist Architect SAR/MSA, in collaboration with Ghilardi + Hellsten Arkitekter, Lead architect Ellen Hellsten,https://www.arkitekt.se/app/uploads/2014/06/T%C3%A4vlingar-2013-Ny- stadsk%C3%A4rna-i-Kiruna-Jury-Pronouncement.pdf Together with researchers from Lule√• and Delft universities, which envisages a denser city centre with a greater focus on sustainability, green and blue infrastructure, pedestrians and public transport rather than automobiles. In 2018, Swedish government announced that it would help arrange replacement work for radio corporation Radiotj√§nst after the city had been moved from its original location.  Geography  Kiruna is located in the north of Sweden, north of the Arctic circle. The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the Torne river to the north and the Kalix river to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town's primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope. The city is built near the lake Luossaj√§rvi with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the Torne river at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the Scandinavian mountains, visible from the city centre. Sweden's highest mountain, Kebnekaise, is from the city centre and can be seen from it as well. To the west is Nikkaluokta and to the northwest are Abisko, Bj√∂rkliden, Riksgr√§nsen and the Norwegian town of Narvik, via the road. north of Kiruna is Kurravaara, on the edge of the Torne River. The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and Finnish borders at Treriksr√∂set. The lower- lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of kilometers into Finland and Russia. Around 15 km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably Jukkasj√§rvi, where an ice hotel is built in winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities G√§llivare and Malmberget are some 120 km south of Kiruna. Kiruna became a Swedish city on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area, even if most of its territory was non- urban. After the Swedish municipality reform in the 1970s, the term \\"city\\" has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a de facto city.  Climate  Being located 145 km (90 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, Kiruna has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with short, cool summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The sun does not set between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. The period that the sun does not rise lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna's winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in North America and Siberia, and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the 45th parallel in the Russian Far East. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern tree line. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the Gulf Stream such, where in fact the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are colder than or similar to Troms√∏'s all-time record low. The coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with recorded in January 1999. The weather station recorded in July 1945, which is the all-time record. The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of . Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low- pressure systems. Due to its extreme daylight cycle, the period between April to August account for 73% of Kiruna's annual sunshine according to the 1961-1990 normals, whereas the five darkest months between October and February contain only around 10% of the annual sunshine.  Transportation  View from just outside Kiruna, with European route E10 left to Lule√• and right to Narvik, Norway (and to Kiruna's railway station) Boeing 737-600 aircraft at Kiruna Airport Kiruna is on the E10 road, connecting Lule√• with Norway and passing near G√§llivare (south of Kiruna) and Narvik (on the Norwegian coast). A short road connects to Kurravaara at the Torne river and ends there. Another road connects Kiruna with Nikkaluokta close to Kebnekaise and is used by tourists to get to the mountains. It passes by or nearby several villages in the Kalix river valley. Buses connect Kiruna with major towns in Norrbotten province and villages nearby and in the wider region. The railway connects Lule√• with G√§llivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, Swedish Rail runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to Stockholm, a day train from Narvik to Lule√• (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and Gothenburg), and trains to Lule√• and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as Karven and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Bj√∂rkliden and Riksgr√§nsen, particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by Transdev in summer. In 2013, the railway station was moved 2 km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bustation in the city centre. Kiruna Airport is southeast of the city, 8 km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Lule√• or Ume√•. An airport bus is available for all flights to and from Stockholm- Arlanda.  Economy =Space research Space research started in the late 1940s. The ESTRACK Kiruna Station of ESA, the European Space Agency, is located in the municipality. So is Esrange, the European Space and Sounding Rocket Range, as well as an EISCAT station and EISCAT scientific headquarters. Also in Kiruna are the Institute of Space Physics and the Department of Space Science belonging to Lule√• University of Technology. In 2007, the Swedish government announced that Kiruna would be the host of Spaceport Sweden, signing an agreement with Virgin Galactic.  Mining  The ore body in Kiruna is an inclined slab of magnetite, 80 m wide, 4 km long and at least 2 km underground Mining plays a major role as a source of national income and employment for Kiruna and the surrounding region. As with most of Northern Sweden the area is rich with Magnetite which is mined to produce various Iron ore products which are then transported by rail to Narvik port in Norway to be shipped to customers around the world. Large-scale mining in Kiruna started in the 19th century right around the time the major Swedish mining company LKAB was founded in 1890.  Tourism  Dog sledding is a popular activity in the countryside surrounding Kiruna. In winter, the Icehotel and northern lights attract tourists. The long and certain snow cover, which generally lasts from October to May, and frozen lakes and rivers facilitate cross-country and alpine skiing, dog sledding and snowmobiling. There are ice climbing in the mountains and ice skating on lakes or rivers. The annual Snow festival is held over the last weekend of Januaryhttp://www.kirunalapland.se and includes scooter jumping, reindeer racing and an ice sculpture contest.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 948. It is part of the Bloomsburg- Berwick Micropolitan Statistical Area. History John Eves, a native of Ireland living in Mill Creek Hundred, Delaware, is thought to have been one of the men to visit the Greenwood Valley and Little Fishing Creek area in 1770. (One account of this visit indicates that he purchased a sizable portion of the land he explored in the area from the Indians who had served as his guides on his journey.) Although he returned to Delaware after this initial visit, he returned the following year with his son Thomas and built a log cabin on the property. The entire Eves family arrived the next year, in 1772, and began tilling the fields adjacent to the cabin as soon as they could be cleared. In 1774, the Eves family received a deed for their property in the valley, the largest land holding at the time in what would later become Columbia County. Title for the land, originally obtained by William and Elizabeth McMean in 1769, was passed to Reuben Haines, and then to John Eves. An Indian uprising, the Battle of Wyoming, in mid-summer of 1778, caused the Eves family to flee their home in the valley and take refuge at a stockade near Washingtonville. Upon their return in 1785, they found their cabin burned and their fields overgrown, but immediately set about to recreate their homestead. File:Millville PA Friends 1795.jpgMillville Friends Meeting House, established in 1795 When the Eves family returned in the mid-1780s, they were determined to make the settlement permanent. They were accompanied or were soon followed by several other families, including Masters, Kisner, Battin, Parker, Lundy, Lemon, Oliver, and Rich. With 17 children and 104 grandchildren, John Eves looked after the building of homes for the family, a gristmill that was to stand for 100 years, and later a sawmill and several other essential structures. Growth of the community was slow because it was not located along a main traveled route or major waterway. Until 1798, Indian trails, which crossed at Millville, were the only accessways to the area. In that year, a road was surveyed across the Mount Pleasant hills to the Susquehanna River. It was 1856 through before the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was laid out through Millville. Early residents were almost entirely self-sufficient. Thomas Eves succeeded his father in ownership of the grist mill and built the first house in what is now Millville Borough. According to an early historian, David and Andrew Eves opened the first store in the area in 1827. David Eves was also commissioned the first postmaster in 1831, followed by his brother Andrew some years later. While the early population was scattered, provision was made for both worship and education. In the early years of the community, services and classes were held in the homes, but in 1785, a school was started in Millville and a two-room meeting house was erected in 1795. Local industry at the time consisted of those operations which were necessary to meet the needs of the early population. Sawmills and grist mills were the first, followed by a woolen mill, started in 1813 by John Watson, several brick plants, and a wagon shop, established by Charles Eves, in 1837. One spurt of growth in Millville occurred in 1856 when the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was constructed. The town experienced considerable growth in the years following construction of this roadway because the community now had adequate access to markets and other transportation links in Bloomsburg. A second period of growth was experienced in 1887 when the railroad was constructed through town. Numerous businesses and industries were created and buildings were erected to service the railroad. A local newspaper, the Weekly Tablet, published its first edition in April 1887.

A martial-arts helmet protects from kicks and punches to the face. A hard hat protects from objects dropped on it. Bicycle, ski, and motorcycle helmets protect the head from impacts on hard surfaces. French cyclist J√©r√©my Leveau wearing a bicycle helmet A helmet is a form of protective gear worn to protect the head. More specifically, a helmet complements the skull in protecting the human brain. Ceremonial or symbolic helmets (e.g. UK policeman's helmet) without protective function are sometimes worn. Soldiers wear helmets, often made from lightweight plastic materials. The word helmet is diminutive from helm, a medieval word for protective combat headgear. The medieval great helm covers the whole head and often is accompanied with camail protecting throat and neck as well. Originally a helmet was a helm which covered the head only partly and protected it from injury in accidents. In civilian life, helmets are used for recreational activities and sports (e.g. jockeys in horse racing, American football, ice hockey, cricket, baseball, camogie, hurling and rock climbing); dangerous work activities (e.g. construction, mining, riot police, fighter pilots); and transportation (e.g. motorcycle helmets and bicycle helmets). Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids. Designs Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound together with cut bramble. Europeans in the tropics often wore the pith helmet, developed in the mid-19th century and made of pith or cork. Military applications in the 19th-20th centuries saw a number of leather helmets, particularly among aviators and tank crews in the early 20th century. In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather. In World War II, American, Soviet, German, Italian and French flight crews wore leather helmets, the German pilots disguising theirs under a beret before disposing of both and switching to cloth caps. The era of the First and Second World Wars also saw a resurgence of metal military helmets, most notably the Brodie helmet and the Stahlhelm. Modern helmets have a much wider range of applications, including helmets adapted to the specific needs of many athletic pursuits and work environments, and these helmets very often incorporate plastics and other synthetic materials for their light weight and shock absorption capabilities. Some types of synthetic fibers used to make helmets in the 21st century include Aramid, Kevlar and Twaron. Helmet types A reenactor wearing a sallet A depiction of Owain Glynd≈µr, prince of Wales in full armour riding his stallion on his great seal Helmets of many different types have developed over time. Most early helmets had military uses, though some may have had more ceremonial than combat applications. Two important helmet types to develop in antiquity were the Corinthian helmet and the Roman galea. During the Middle Ages, many different military helmets and some ceremonial helmets were developed, almost all being metal. Some of the more important medieval developments included the great helm, the bascinet, the frog-mouth helm and the armet. The great seal of Owain Glynd≈µr (c. 1359 ‚Äì c. 1415) depicts the prince of Wales & his stallion wearing full armour, they both wear protective headgear with Owain's gold dragon mounted on top. This would have been impractical in battle, so therefore these would have been ceremonial.http://www.gutorglyn.net/gutoswales/llun.php?src=diddordeb_sel_og.jpg&teitl;=Great+Seal+of+Owain+Glynd%C5%B5r+&testun;=The+reverse+of+the+Great+Seal+of+Owain+Glynd%C5%B5r. In the 19th century, more materials were incorporated, namely leather, felt and pith. The pith helmet and the leather pickelhaube were important 19th century developments. The greatest expansion in the variety of forms and composition of helmets, however, took place in the 20th century, with the development of highly specialized helmets for a multitude of athletic and professional applications, as well as the advent of modern plastics. During World War I, the French army developed the Adrian helmet, the British developed the Brodie helmet, and the Germans produced the Stahlhelm. A motocross helmet showing the elongated visor and chin bar Flight helmets were also developed throughout the 20th century. A multitude of athletic helmets, including football helmets, batting helmets, cricket helmets, bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets and racing helmets, were also developed in the 20th century. Helmets since the mid-20th century have often incorporated lightweight plastics and other synthetic materials, and their use has become highly specialized. Some important recent developments include the French SPECTRA helmet, Spanish MARTE helmet or the American PASGT (commonly called \\"Kevlar\\" by U.S. troops) and Advanced Combat Helmet, or ACH. Heraldry As the coat of arms was originally designed to distinguish noble combatants on the battlefield or in a tournament, even while covered in armour, it is not surprising that heraldic elements constantly incorporated the shield and the helmet, these often being the most visible parts of a knight's military equipment. The practice of indicating peerage through the display of barred or grilled helmets first appeared around 1587-1615, P. 319. and the heraldic convention of displaying helmets of rank in the United Kingdom, which came into vogue around Stuart times, is as follows:Fox-Davies, P. 303. *Sovereign: a gold barred-face (tournament) helm placed affront√© *Peer's helmet: silver barred-face (tournament) helm placed in profile *Knight's or baronet's helmet: steel helm (earlier jousting helm, later close helm) placed affront√© with visor open *Esquire's helmet: steel helm placed in profile with visor closed Earlier rolls of arms reveal, however, that early heraldic helmets were depicted in a manner faithful to the styles in actual military or tournament use at the time.Fox-Davies, P. 316.

It mined, for its own requirements and for sale, ore from its own iron ore fields. At a large number of its own power stations, situated on Svart√§lven and its tributaries, the company produced electrical energy which was widely distributed to its own works and outside customers. The company also grew timber on a large scale, and an extensive private railway system runs right through the company's forests which cover several hundred thousand acres in H√§llefors and surrounding municipalities. The general management of the company was at H√§llefors, where the company operated ironworks, a wood-grinding mill, a sawmill, a box factory and joinery works. The small town Loka is located in H√§llefors Municipality. They are bottling mineral water from their well, that once housed a thermal bath.

Linesville is within the Conneaut School District and is home to the district's administration offices, along with Alice Shafer Elementary and Linesville Junior-Senior High School. Points of interest Presbyterian Church on an old postcard There are several points of interest throughout the town, chiefly Pymatuning Lake and the Linesville Spillway. In warm weather, the spillway on the sanctuary (eastern) side is home to thousands of oversized carp, attracted by the bread thrown into the water by visitors; this is known as \\"The Place Where the Ducks Walk on the Fish\\", coined by local businessman Alpine Maclaine. The spillway is locally billed as \\"Pennsylvania's second most popular tourist attraction, after the Liberty Bell\\", and the logo of the Linesville Volunteer Fire Department used to be a duck standing on the back of a fish. Pymatuning Lake is one of the largest man-made lakes in Pennsylvania. It was created in the 1930s as a Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) project. Linesville is also home to the University of Pittsburgh's Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology. Linesville is the birthplace of noteworthy traveler Winfield Line (Amos Line's great-great-grandson) who, in 1922-23 with his brother Francis, hiked/hitchhiked through every state in the Union. This pair of brothers later wrote a book entitled Foot by Foot Through the USA, A High Adventure Odyssey to Every State in the Union, which chronicled their journey.http://www.envisionlinesville.org/Route6/Documents/USRt6_MuseumVC_MasterPlan_FINALrev02.pdf Another minor point of interest is at the main intersection of the town (at its sole traffic light). On the Maclaine Building at the northwest corner is a sign reading \\"<CHICAGO: 500 miles NEW YORK: 500 miles>\\" (the true midpoint between the two is actually about a mile west). At one time, Linesville was the onion capital of the United States, distributing its fragrant produce via the Erie & Pittsburgh Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Linesville made national news in November 2005 when 18-year-old Christopher Seeley was elected mayor, one of the youngest mayors to serve in a U.S. city to date.

The city is within of Erie and within of Pittsburgh. It was the first permanent settlement in Northwestern Pennsylvania. The population was 13,388 at the 2010 census. The city of Meadville is the principal city of the Meadville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. As well as one of two cities, the other being Erie, that make up the larger Erie-Meadville, PA Combined Statistical Area.  History  Meadville was settled on May 12, 1788, by a party of settlers led by David Mead. Its location was chosen well, for it lies at the confluence of Cussewago Creek and French Creek, and was only a day's travel by boat to the safety of Fort Franklin. Their settlement was in a large meadow, first cleared by Native Americans led by Chief Custaloga, and well suited for growing maize. The village Custaloga built here was known as Cussewago. Custaloga's name first appeared in western Pennsylvania's history in George Washington's journal of 1754. When Washington arrived in the village of Venango (Fort Machault), Custaloga was in charge of the wampum of his nation. This wampum was a message that was sent to the Six Nations if the French refused to leave the land. Custaloga was the chief of the Munsee or Wolf Clan of Delawares and he also ruled over the Delawares at the town of Cussewago, at the present site of Meadville. The neighboring Iroquois and Lenape befriended the isolated settlement, but their enemies, including the Wyandots, were not so amiable. The threat of their attacks caused the settlement to be evacuated for a time in 1791. Around 1800, many of the settlers to the Meadville area came after receiving land bounties for service in the Revolutionary War. Meadville became an important transportation center after construction of the French Creek Feeder Canal in 1837 and of the Beaver and Erie Canal it connected to at Conneaut Lake and subsequent railroad development. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Meadville played a small part in the Underground Railroad helping escaping slaves to freedom. An event in September 1880 led to the end of segregation by race in the state's public schools. At the South Ward schools, Elias Allen tried unsuccessfully to enroll his two children. He appealed to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, and Judge Pearson Church declared unconstitutional the 1854 state law mandating separate schools for Negro children. This law was amended, effective July 4, 1881, to prohibit such segregation.HistoricalMarkers.com Retrieved on December 14, 2008. By the late 19th century, Meadville's economy was also driven by logging, agriculture, and iron production. The Talon Corporation, headquartered in Meadville, played a major role in the development of the zipper. Since the clothing industry was largely unaffected by the Great Depression, the community saw a population boom at that time. During World War II, the nearby Keystone Ordnance plant brought additional jobs to the area. Drawing of 1914 zipper patent filling The high demand for zippers created favorable conditions for the Talon Company, and so became Meadville's most crucial industry. The company encountered significant difficulties after it was absorbed by Textron industries in 1968, eventually ending up bankrupt. Today, nothing remains of Talon in Meadville except for a few run down buildings. However, as a result of the need for close tolerances and tool and die makers, a cottage industry of tool and die shops was established which resulted in Meadville, earning the city the nickname Tool City with more tool shops per capita than any place else in the United States. In 1886, a blacksmith from Evansburg, Pennsylvania, George B. DeArment, began hand-forging farrier's tools and selling them from town to town out of the back of a wagon. The business eventually became known as the Champion Bolt and Clipper Company. In 1904, now named Channellock, the company moved to a facility in Meadville and added nippers, pinchers and open- end wrenches to its product line. George B. DeArment's two sons, Almon W. and J. Howard DeArment, became partners in the company in 1911 and expanded the product line again to include hammers. In 1923, the company moved again to a facility at its current location. Four years later, the name of the company was changed to the Champion‚ÄìDeArment Tool Company. Talon remained a major employer, along with the Erie Railroad, American Viscose Corporation (later known as Avtex Fibers), Channellock tools, and Dad's Pet Food. The area actually saw an increase in population during the Great Depression and the economy continued to grow past World War ll. In the 1980s, the Great Lakes region saw a decline in heavy industry. By the early 1990s, Channellock and Dad's were the only large companies operating in Meadville. This blow to the local economy was softened by subsequent surge in light industry, mainly tool and die machine shops. The area has seen growth in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. The song \\"Bittersweet Motel\\" by Vermont jam band, Phish, was inspired when keyboardist Page McConnell left a wedding in Meadville and drove to the Pittsburgh Airport. In addition to the Meadville Downtown Historic District, several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Baldwin-Reynolds House, Bentley Hall (Allegheny College), Independent Congregational Church, Dr. J. R. Mosier Office, Roueche House, Ruter Hall (Allegheny College), and Judge Henry Shippen House.  Attractions = Baldwin-Reynolds house  Baldwin Reynolds house was built in 1843 by United States Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin Originally built in 1843 by United States Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin. Just a few months after the house was complete, Henry Baldwin died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After his death, the house became a girls‚Äô school for three years until it was sold to a local businessman, William Reynolds. Thus, the house became The Baldwin- Reynolds House and now serves as a museum of history, the arts and cultural experiences in northwest Pennsylvania. The Baldwin-Reynold house offers free tours in the summer. David Mead's original house and settlement  David Mead's House  A replica of founder David Mead's log cabin, the first permanent settlement in northwestern Pennsylvania, is located at Bicentennial Park along the banks of French Creek. The replica was built as a part of Meadville's Bicentennial celebration in 1988. The cabin is used as an educational resource for school tours and the general public.  Diamond Park  Replica of founder David Mead's log cabin Diamond Park is Meadville's central park and has been used for a variety of different purposes for over two centuries. In the 19th century, the park was used as militia drill grounds leading up to and during the Civil War. After the Civil War was over, Diamond Park became more open to the public with grass, statues, monuments and a gazebo. It is now used as a recreational park for the community. The Meadville Market House  The Meadville Market House  A monument in the shape of a scroll dedicated to the founder of Meadville, David Mead The Market House is a prominent historical building located in downtown Meadville. It is the oldest continuously-run market structure in the state of Pennsylvania, and still serves as a hub for local farmers. Farmers markets are still held on Saturdays. Education=Colleges Meadville is the home of Allegheny College, a liberal arts college with approximately 1,700 students. Allegheny was founded in April 1815 by the Reverend Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard's School of Divinity. The college was historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church after 1833, although it is currently non-sectarian. The first class, consisting of four male students, began their studies on July 4, 1816, without any formal academic buildings. Within six years, Alden accumulated sufficient funds to begin building a campus. The first building erected, the library, was designed by Alden himself, and is a notable example of early American architecture. Bentley Hall is named in honor of Dr. William Bentley, who donated his private library to the College, a collection of considerable value and significance. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Alden, expressing the hope that his University of Virginia could someday possess the richness of Allegheny's library. Alden served as president of the college until 1831, when financial and enrollment difficulties forced his resignation. Ruter Hall was built in 1853. Note: This includes Meadville Theological School was established in 1844 by a wealthy businessman and Unitarian named Harm Jan Huidekoper. It moved to Chicago in 1926.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.49%, is water. Boiling Springs gets its name from the natural artesian well springs located in and around the town. Boiling Springs ranks seventh in size of springs in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The largest of these springs named \\"the Bubble\\" is a 2nd magnitude spring based on its average discharge of around 0.7 cubic meters per second. About of water flows per day from a total of 30 springs dotted across approximately . The impression of \\"boiling\\" does not result from the temperature of the water, which stays at year-round, but rather from a unique hydrogeological feature. Two vertical diabase dikes, made up of highly impermeable igneous basalt parent rock, cut through the limestone bedrock in the area and form a subterranean \\"V\\", with Boiling Springs located at the interior tip of the V.Flippo, H. N., Jr. [1974], Springs of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Office of Resources Management, Water Resources Bulletin 10, 46 p. The dikes were formed around 200 million years ago, during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods, when Pangaea broke apart: the same period of geological activity that formed the Palisades Sill. What is now eastern North America began to separate from what is now north-western Africa. Deep faults formed in the earth's crust as the continental sections pulled apart. Magma was generated through decompression melting, and this molten rock pushed up to fill the faults. The cooler temperatures of the upper crust quickly solidified the hot rock, preventing it from reaching the surface. This geological process created large, thin, subvertical sheets of impermeable basalt, or diabase dikes. Paleontological Research Institution, \\"Topography of the Appalachian/Piedmont: Region 2\\", p. 117 When precipitation flows down South Mountain, a large amount of groundwater is produced. Much of the water, which has an acidic pH, is able to erode the valley's limestone bedrock and continue flowing at about below the soil. However, some of the water is trapped by the impermeable diabase dikes, which act as a hydrologic barrier. The water becomes progressively confined by the dikes as it nears the tip of the \\"V\\". Due to the positive pressure created by this confinement, water is pushed up to the surface and out of the artesian aquifer, giving the impression of \\"boiling\\" springs. The springs have a median flow of per minute. These springs, collectively known as a \\"spring swarm\\" discharge 5 to 7 times the expected infiltration given its topographic watershed.Becher, A. E. (1991), Stop 7; Hydrogeology and the source of Boiling Springs, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in Geology in the South Mountain Area, Pennsylvania: Guidebook for the 56th Annual Field Conference of Pennsylvania Geologists, edited by W. D. Sevon and N. Potter, pp. 189‚Äì193. Data collected via the use of highly precise and accurate data loggers have revealed the springs hydrograph to display discharge surges, while temperature, conductivity, and turbidity remain constant. Water temperature varies seasonally by 0.3 ¬∞C but is 6 months out of phase with air temperature. A new model that has been proposed to account for these findings suggests that the excess water emanating from the springs originates from an area 60 km to the southeast on the southern side of South Mountain near the West Conewago Creek, Lat 40\`04'56\\", long 76\`43'13\\". The Bubble One of the most prominent springs in this area is called the \\"Bubble\\". It is located directly behind the Boiling Springs Tavern, at the intersection of 1st Street and Front Street. The name of the Boiling Springs High School mascot, \\"The Bubblers\\", was inspired by this spring. Children's Lake Swans nesting, a few yards downstream from The Bubble This body of water was formed by partially damming the brook fed from 30 natural springs, including the \\"Bubble\\". Children's Lake is home to many ducks, swans, and geese throughout the year. The lake dates to the 1750s when the dam was used to provide water power for iron production. In the mid-18th century, a grist mill was built by Michael Ege on the southeast shore of the lake, to provide flour and grain for the iron works. This building has been converted into apartments. Historic grist mill in Boiling Springs On the east shore, remaining from the pre-revolutionary iron forge complex, are the original forge and the iron master's mansion with the remnants of its terraced gardens. This 1795 Georgian structure is the most outstanding example of architecture in the Boiling Springs Historic District and of major historical significance as the home of the Ege family. The mansion is presently in a deteriorating condition and is uninhabited. The lake feeds into Yellow Breeches Creek. A picturesque, natural stone three-arch bridge, built in 1854, stands behind the mill, spanning the creek. This limestone trout stream has developed a national reputation for fly fishing. Where Children's Lake runs into the Yellow Breeches, a one-mile stretch of water known as \\"The Junction\\" provides quality catch-and-release fishing year round. This is arguably the most intensely fished section of water in Pennsylvania when the White Mayfly hatches. Limestone bedrock streams are rich in minerals, which serve as the basis for the trout's food chain and contribute to healthy growth rates for trout. Appalachian Trail Boiling Springs and South Middleton Township, which are near the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail, were designated Pennsylvania's first Appalachian Trail Community. In 2010, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy started recognizing towns near the trail that are assets to hikers and the trail. As of 2012, Boiling Springs is one of 23 designated Appalachian Trail Communities. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Office of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is located at 4 East First Street in Boiling Springs, sharing space with the Boiling Springs Appalachian Trail Information Center. As one of only four regional offices along the trail, the staff covers New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia south through Shenandoah National Park. It is the only Appalachian Trail Conservancy office that is located on the famous footpath itself. Several hundred hikers pass through every week during the busy seasons. Hikers often mail themselves packages to pick up at the Boiling Springs Post Office, which is just feet from the trail. The Boiling Springs Pool offers hikers a shower for $1, and there are several bed and breakfasts, a nearby campground and even a resident who lets hikers sleep in the backyard. Nearby Allenberry Resort Inn and Playhouse rents rooms to hikers for a reasonable rate. History Boiling Springs was settled by Europeans prior to 1737.Historic South Middleton Township, pp. 1-2. The springs were partially dammed in the 1750s to provide water power for iron production, with raw materials of iron ore, timber and limestone plentiful in the neighboring mountains. The Carlisle Iron Works was in full production by the 1760s, and a grist mill was built at the end of the lake in 1762. While the foundry's iron was probably used to make ammunition and weapons for the Continental Army, no cannons were made.Richard Tritt and Randy Watts. \\"At a Place Called the Boiling Springs\\". [1995] Daniel Kaufman, who laid out the village of Boiling Springs in 1845, purchased from his father, Abraham, in 1843. He built his 301 Front Street home in 1880. Kaufman and Boiling Springs played a role in the Underground Railroad. Kaufman was an Underground Railroad agent from 1835 to 1847. The Underground Railroad asked him to set up a necessary stopover between Shippensburg and Harrisburg. Kaufman provided food and transportation to fugitive slaves passing through the area; his barn and a densely wooded area nearby served as shelter. Kaufman was sued by a Maryland slave owner in 1847 and convicted in Cumberland County, but the verdict was overturned by the state Supreme Court. He was then charged in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia and convicted. He was ultimately fined $4,000 in 1852, in a case that drew wide attention. Boiling Springs is now part of the Network to Freedom, a series of noteworthy sites along the Underground Railroad. The area around the lake was a recreation spot as early as 1875 when a steam launch began to operate to carry picnickers down the mill race to Island Grove, on Yellow Breeches Creek. In 1895, trolley car lines were added running from Carlisle and Harrisburg. The Valley Traction Company leased the lake in 1900 and built a park as a destination for passengers on their trolleys. Boiling Springs became a resort community, with travelers coming to picnic and boat on the lake, with such park attractions as a dance pavilion, picnic pavilion, miniature steam railway and a merry-go-round. The trolley was operated until around 1930.Historic South Middleton Township, pp. 14-22. The Boiling Springs Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Episode #13 of the second season of the classic TV series Route 66 was set in and filmed in Boiling Springs. The episode was titled \\"Burning for Burning\\" and was first aired on December 29, 1961. Entertainment Opening day of trout season, Yellow Breeches Creek, Boiling Springs Recreation continues to bring people to Boiling Springs, ranging from fly-fishing on Yellow Breeches Creek to theater, dining and lodging at Allenberry Resort,Allenberry Resort which opened in the summer of 1946. Allenberry Playhouse,Allenberry Playhouse whose season runs more than 40 weeks - from March to December - produced its first stage performance in 1949. The Boiling Springs Tavern, a restaurant in downtown Boiling Springs, is a popular dining destination. Parts of the tavern, which is located along an old stagecoach route, date to 1832. One of the newest eateries in town, Caffe 101, opened in 2010 in a historic building at 101 Front Street. Boiling Springs has an annual juried arts and crafts show, called Foundry Day,Foundry Day on the first Saturday in June. The booths and food vendors stretch down Front Street, next to Children's Lake. The annual Carlisle Summerfair Festival's Anything Floats\\"Anything Floats\\" event is held on the 4th of July. Teams create their own vessel and then paddle the boat from one end of Children's Lake (near the Boiling Springs Tavern) to the other end (near the Grist Mill and the Boiling Springs Pool). There is also an inner tube race. Of course, the main idea is to be the fastest boat or inner tube captain to make the trip ‚Äì but most of the fun is watching to see which team is going to make it without tipping over! The Boiling Springs PoolBoiling Springs Pool was built in 1927 by Gilbert Malcolm, husband of Helen Bucher. It was the first public swimming facility in Cumberland County. The pool is still open to the public today. The facility offers four pools and three waterslides. They also have a full- service snack bar and plenty of grass and shade areas.

History Jay Cooke was among the investors who in 1864 purchased the South Mountain Iron Company at Pine Grove Furnace, a charcoal-fired iron operation dating to 1764. The specific reason that Cooke Township was created in 1872 out of previously existing Penn Township (established 1860) is unclear. Jay Cooke lost the company in the Panic of 1873, but bought back a major portion of it four years later with a group of investors as the South Mountain Mining and Iron Company. Jay Cooke by Henry Shrady, Duluth, Minnesota He was still a co- owner at the time of his death. According to the biography by Oberholtzer (who Cooke and his family assisted), Jay Cooke visited Pine Grove Furnace repeatedly. Cooke fished for trout there‚Äîhe was an avid outdoorsman throughout his life‚Äîand he annually brought gifts such as pocket knives and scissors to the small school established there for the workers' children. Cooke Township continues to this day as a very lightly populated but heavily forested area, while the former center of the iron industry within it is now Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The Pine Grove Furnace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

History Named for a settlement of mechanics who made and repaired Conestoga wagons in the early 19th century, Mechanicsburg's continued growth was also attributed to the Cumberland Valley Railroad (CVRR). Completing its line in 1837, Mechanicsburg was designated as a water station where workers could restock the locomotive's wood and pump water. The train became the town's link to the world of business and industry. Grain and feed companies, lumber yards and numerous factories were purposely built alongside the railroad tracks. Archives show that, at one time, there were twenty-five trains chugging through the town daily carrying travelers, coal, feathers, fruit, ice, mail and newspapers. During the American Civil War, the railroad was an invaluable method of transporting troops and supplies. Today, approximately six trains travel through Mechanicsburg each day, which has recently increased due to new operations on the local sub-line owned by Norfolk Southern. Another part of Mechanicsburg's growth occurred when the Naval Support Activity was built on of land in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania. NSA Mechanicsburg continues to serve as one of the Defense Department's major logistics sites. Although automotive technology changed the town forever, today's residents cannot dismiss the vital role the railroad played in its development. Present-day Mechanicsburg is centered on that Leonard Fisher purchased from Joseph Heynes tract (No. 1442 of an original grant of from William Penn. Before becoming incorporated on April 12, 1828, the town went by several different names. First, Drytown, because of the extreme scarcity of water during the winter and summer. It was also known as Pinchgut, a German name used as a sign of amusement given to a small village of only a few people. Some also referred to the town as Staufferstown, in honor of Henry Stauffer, the owner of much of the land in the center of town. Briefly referred to as Creekville during the Colonial Era, Mechanicsburg is home to many historic markers, such as Irving Female College (named for Washington Irving, a trustee), the first women's college in Pennsylvania to grant degrees in arts and sciences. On June 28, 1863, Confederate troops led by Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins raided Mechanicsburg, and two days later, met with Union forces in the Skirmish of Sporting Hill, just east of town. It is known as the northernmost engagement of the Civil War. Following the Skirmish of Sporting Hill, the Confederate forces retreated south into the little town of Gettysburg where the Battle of Gettysburg would be fought. The oldest building in Mechanicsburg is the Frankeberger Tavern. One of Mechanicsburg's first residents was George Frankeberger, who in 1801 applied for a license to open his newly built log home for the \\"convenience\\" of travelers. In exchange for a small fee, Mr. Frankeberger offered cattle drivers a warm meal and a place to sleep. This proved to be rather lucrative, as many people were making the two-day trek between Harrisburg (the state capital) and Carlisle (Cumberland County's county seat). The Mechanicsburg Commercial Historic District, Irving Female College, Cumberland Valley Railroad Station and Station Master's House, Adam Orris House, and Simpson Street School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Perry County line follows the crest of Blue Mountain. Conodoguinet Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, crosses the southern part of the township just north of Carlisle, making several large bends.

Unincorporated communities in North Middleton Township: *Schlusser, a census-designated place *Caprivi History When Cumberland County was founded in 1750, it originally consisted of three townships: East and West Pennsborough Townships, and Middleton Township. In 1810, due to population increase, Middleton Township was divided into North Middleton Township to the north of Carlisle, and South Middleton Township to the south. In the mid 18th century, the area that is now the township was inhabited primarily by Scotch Irish settlers who were granted land patents in that region by the family of William Penn, the proprietors of Pennsylvania at the time. The rapid settlement of this area at that time was the result of the Penns' plan to keep the Scotch Irish who were viewed as rowdy and unsophisticated out of the more refined Lancaster and York counties to the southeast. Thus, by the late 1700s, the population west of the Susquehanna River was composed almost exclusively of Scotch Irish settlers. As was common of most areas in the Cumberland Valley at that time, most early settlers of North Middleton Township were farmers by trade, and perhaps the area's most lasting legacy was the great quantity and quality of barns built there. The majority of these barns exhibited a style that came to be known as the Pennsylvania barn. Many of these barns were built during the late 1800s, but a fair number still exist in the township today. According to a township publication from 1976, there were 78 barns still standing in the area, and although this number has dwindled since that time, there are still several dozen barns in the township today, and agriculture still remains a substantial sector in the region's economy.

Its seat is located in the town of Surahammar. The municipality is located some 100 km west of Stockholm in the southern part of the mineral-rich Bergslagen region. The municipality was formed in 1963 through the amalgamation of Ramn√§s and Sura.  Localities  * Ramn√§s * Surahammar (seat) * Virsbo  History  Steelmaking in this municipality was started on a larger scale in the 16th and 17th centuries when forges were built there. It was a new phenomenon to run forge mills separate from mining and pig iron production sites in Bergslagen. The mills were located in Virsbo, Ramn√§s and Surahammar and pig iron was transported from mills further north, initially by horse-sledges in the winter. There was ample local supply of hydropower to run the forge hammers and timber to make charcoal. Later, when Str√∂msholm Canal was finished, it was used to ship finished products to V√§ster√•s and Stockholm for export. This restructuring process appears to have been driven by the need to secure access to hydropower and timber for the forges since both the mines and blast furnaces used up considerable amounts of resources in the production of pig iron. Over time, the mills specialised and in Ramn√§s the key product became iron chains ‚Äì in modern days for the off- shore industry ‚Äì and in Surahammar wheel-sets for the rail road industry and electro steels, both with ASEA as a major customer. In Surahammar, Gustaf Eriksson developed the first combustion-engine automobile built in Sweden in 1897. It formed the basis for a new Swedish industry that was located in S√∂dert√§lje under the name of Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget i S√∂dertelge (renamed in 1906 to Vabis that later merged with Scania AB). Today, the mills in Virsbo, Ramn√§s and Surahammar have been transformed into modern industries with international owners.

History Dauphin borough began as a settlement at the mouth of Stony Creek, the head of a valley between Second and Third Mountains. It was established by Samuel Sturgeon in 1765.Egle (1883) p. 447 By the end of the eighteenth century, the Sturgeon property was owned by Revolutionary War soldier Timothy Green. The locality became known as Green's Mill, after the grist mill Colonel Green built at the mouth of the creek. According to local history, the area was also known for its colonial-period fort, alternately called Fort Lyon or Fort McKee. Colonel Green continued to hold highly valued real estate until his death in 1812. By 1814, his plantation property with its mills became part of his son Judge Innis Green's holdings.Dauphin County Deed Book U1, p. 238Larson (1976) p. 20 Judge Green continued to add to his real estate holdings throughout the early nineteenth century. Early road map showing Dauphin Borough and surrounding mountains The surrounding township is called Middle Paxton, part of the former Paxton Township of Lancaster County prior to the creation of Dauphin County in 1785. Middle Paxton Township was incorporated in 1787. The main geographic feature of this area are ancient hills or mountains and narrow valleys that generally run east to west with streams emptying into the Susquehanna River. The township remained rural until the twentieth century. Judge Green laid out Dauphin as \\"Port Lyon\\" in recognition of the former fort in 1826. Green named the Port Lyon streets after Pennsylvania rivers and creeks. Opportunities for economic expansion for the area appeared bright that year, as legislation was passed for creation of the Pennsylvania Canal. This fostered expectations that Dauphin would become a port to the coalfields lying to the northeast. Green acted on behalf of the Dauphin & Susquehanna (D & S) Coal Company, which had purchased eighteen tracts of land on or near Little Mountain, totaling about , from a group of businessmen.Dauphin County Deed Book A2, p. 171 Charles Bird had earlier that year purchased four tracts of land in Middle Paxton Township from Judge Green. Bird's interest was purchased by a group of businessmen who then sold to the D & S Coal Company.Dauphin County Deed Book H2, p. 182 Green received the last payment on the agreement price of US $10,000.00 in 1835. Business directory map of Dauphin Borough in 1862 Dauphin was incorporated into a borough by an act of Assembly in 1845.Everts & Stewart (1875), p. 31 According to the 1850 census, Dauphin had 650 inhabitants at that time. There were 124 families in 118 dwellings. The 1860 census for the borough illustrated the working-class nature of the people living there. The borough had 649 inhabitants in 129 households, nearly the same as recorded in 1850. Fifty-five of the men listed their occupation as \\"day laborer\\". The 1870 census showed a marked change in the occupation of Dauphin's residents. Jobs related to the canal had dropped dramatically, while those associated with the railroads had increased substantially. At this time there were 151 households living in 148 dwellings. The borough's population had increased to 742. By 1875, the borough contained four churches, three schools and one select school, and two lodges. The 1880 census showed 155 families living in 146 dwellings in Dauphin. View of Dauphin Borough, c. 1910 In the early twentieth century, several \\"summer\\" houses were constructed on the edge of Second Mountain, south of Stony Creek. Middle-class residents of Harrisburg built these houses as second homes to supplement their primary townhouses. These houses are collectively called \\"Hillside\\" and have since become year-round homes. The borough, situated along the Susquehanna River, has always been associated with transportation. Original Native American trails would have followed waterways such as the river and Stony Creek. Development of the canal system of transporting goods during the early nineteenth century gave way to the rise of the railroads, which lasted for much of the twentieth. U.S. Route 22 became a major highway through Pennsylvania during the mid-twentieth century, parts of which were actually constructed within the footprint of the former Pennsylvania Canal. Dauphin thus developed as an early transportation hub, but in more recent decades has been bypassed by more significant routes of transport, such as the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. Freedom Bible Church In the last forty or so years, Dauphin Borough has been a bedroom community of Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital. Many of its civic centers had gone into steep decline, industry migrated elsewhere, taverns and hotels closed, as did schools and churches. The railroad, which declined during the late twentieth century, has been reduced to two tracks paralleling the river, with no stops or stations in Dauphin. One of the reasons for the decline was that as traffic on U.S. Rte. 22 increased, the borough became less desirable as a place in which to reside. By the 1980s, traffic on Rte. 22 was so heavy that the road essentially cut the borough in half. Residents often had such a difficult time traveling across the borough that they waited until after morning and evening rush hours. On weekends when the Pennsylvania State University in State College, some upstate, held football games, Rte. 22 through the borough was impassable. In older times, Dauphin was the hub of a collection of small village centers in Middle Paxton Township of Dauphin County. Some of these settlements included Singersville, just east of the borough; Ellendale Forge, up Stony Creek Valley; Dauphin Furnace, west of town at the mouth of Clark Creek; Speeceville, west of town at the foot of Peters Mountain; and Heckton Mills, south of Second Mountain about a mile downriver from Dauphin. Much of the eastern part of the township, between Peters Mountain and Second Mountain, is forested and preserved as State Game Lands. Most of these village centers have ceased to exist as the western part of Middle Paxton Township became suburbanized. The nearest organized towns to Dauphin are Duncannon, a borough on the western shore of the river; Halifax, a borough north of Peters Mountain; and Harrisburg, the state capital to the south. In the late 1990s, following many years of planning and several postponements, Dauphin Borough was bypassed. A construction project that had caused much controversy resulted in relocating U.S. Rte. 22 closer to the river and out of, or over, Dauphin Borough. Approximately 28% of the borough's taxable real estate was taken in order to construct the bypass. The remaining town, free of the traffic problems, became once again desirable as a location for commuters to Harrisburg. Some of the last remaining open land in the borough was developed as residential space, and older structures in the borough were increasingly bought and renovated by commuters. Despite the losses in tax revenues owing to construction of the bypass, the local government continues to operate through cost-saving, cooperative efforts with Middle Paxton Township. Sewer system connections were extended to borough residents in Hillside and along River Road as part of a collection system and pump station upgrade. In 2011, the Dauphin/Middle Paxton Fire Company relocated its apparatus from the borough to a new government building housing Middle Paxton Township offices and Public Safety. The local ambulance association became dormant, and Susquehanna Township E.M.S. began covering medical emergencies in both borough and township.

It was founded and laid out in 1765 by Thomas Lingle. The population was 6,334 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Harrisburg-Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area. History In 1765, Thomas Lingle purchased a parcel of land in what was then Paxton Township, so as to develop a 90-plot living, working, and studying community for newly- arriving European settlers. He called his new settlement \\"The Town of St. Thomas\\", after the Christian apostle, his namesake. The sheepskin document on which Lingle drew the plan for his village still exists, showing in great detail the village's name, each of the plots, their plot numbers, and all street and alley names. The county deed recorder's seal and record information are visible on the bottom left corner of the document. In 1811, Lingle died and was buried in the Wenrich's Church cemetery (now St. Thomas United Church of Christ), at the east end of the village. Soon thereafter, village and area residentes began calling his village \\"Lingle's town\\", and the name soon took on its current form. As a busy crossroads community located at the base of the mountain, the village soon became the area center for commerce, civic, religious, and educational activities, much of which still exists today.

At the center of the square is a flag pole located in the middle of the road. The initial plan was to move the flag pole and insert a traffic light. After long debate, that idea was shot down. It was replaced by the \\"Linglestown Plan\\", proposed on March 31, 2000. Nearly seven years later, on February 20, 2007, Lower Paxton Township approved a modified version of the Linglestown Action Plan, which involves the addition of roundabouts, other approaches to slowing down traffic through the square, and general community improvement. On September 11, 2009, PennDOT awarded a construction bid for the project to E. Wintermyer Co. of Etters. While the road construction was intended not only to relieve traffic but also promote an aesthetic aspect in order to draw in business for Linglestown merchants, many of those merchants faced the brink of closing.http://www.abc27.com/story/13021496/2-way-traffic-to-resume-in- linglestown-sooner-than- expectedhttp://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/06/linglestown_road_constructon_p.html In June 2010, the project entered its final phase.

The township was incorporated in 1767 from Paxton Township. The population was 47,360 at the 2010 census. It is the second-most populous municipality in the county, after Harrisburg (population 49,673). History In 1729 the Paxtang Township was established within Lancaster County. The spelling \\"Paxtang\\" is from the original Indian name Peshtank, which meant \\"standing water\\". Today the word \\"Paxton\\" is used instead of Paxtang. On March 4, 1785, the boundaries of Paxtang Township also became the borders of Dauphin County, split from Lancaster County. \\"Dauphin\\" refers to the Dauphin of France, heir apparent to the French throne, whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. About two years later in August 1787 the legislature began to splinter Paxtang Township, first into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang and Lower Paxtang. In the years after Dauphin County was established, the township was slowly divided. Hanover Township was cut off to the east in 1736, and Upper Paxton Township was cut off to the north in 1767. What remained in 1767 was then renamed Lower Paxton Township. The divisions continued. Harrisburg Borough (now the city of Harrisburg) was formed in 1791, and Swatara Township was created in 1799. In 1878 more land was cut off the north and became Middle Paxton Township. Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now occupied by Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry and Susquehanna townships. Lower Paxton has remained the same area since Susquehanna Township was formed from it on May 1, 1815. Geography Lower Paxton Township is located in south-central Dauphin County, bordered by Susquehanna Township to the west, Middle Paxton Township to the north, West Hanover and South Hanover townships to the east, and Swatara Township to the south. The eastern border of Lower Paxton Township is formed by Beaver Creek, a south-flowing tributary of Swatara Creek, which flows to the Susquehanna River. The northern border of the township follows or is close to the crest of Blue Mountain, the southernmost ridge of the Ridge- and-Valley Appalachians in this region.

Harrisburg, PA Sept. 2006. Environment Local waterways have been significantly impacted by development. The Paxton Creek watershed, which drains much of the northern part of the township and flows west to the Susquehanna River, has experienced substantial change in land uses during the past several decades. Development is encroaching on some of Paxton Creek's headwaters. This has affected water levels and flow patterns, and caused significant erosion, sedimentation, and flooding. This watershed now produces over twice the nutrients and 10 times the yields of suspended sediments that are released by typical forested basins, according to the Paxton Creek Watershed and Education Association.2005 State Land Use and Growth Management Report, Pennsylvania Office of Community and Economic Development.

Flemish school, collection of the Mercers' Company, City of London Sir Thomas Gresham the Elder (; c. 1519 ‚Äì 21 November 1579), was an English merchant and financier who acted on behalf of King Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553) and Edward's half-sisters, queens Mary I (1553‚Äì1558) and Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603). In 1565 Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in the City of London. Origins Born in London and descended from an old Norfolk family, Gresham was one of two sons and two daughters of Sir Richard Gresham, a leading City merchant mercer and Lord Mayor of London, who was knighted by King Henry VIII for negotiating favourable loans with foreign merchants. Education Gresham was educated at St Paul's School. After this, although his father wanted Thomas to become a merchant, Sir Richard first sent him to university at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was concurrently apprenticed in the Mercers' Company to his uncle Sir John Gresham, founder of Gresham's School, while he was still at Cambridge. Agent in the Low Countries In 1543 the Mercers' Company admitted the 24-year-old Gresham as a liveryman, and later that year he left England for the Low Countries, where, either on his own account or that of his father or uncle, he both carried on business as a merchant whilst acting in various matters as agent for King Henry VIII. In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of the London merchant Sir William Read, but maintained residence principally in the Low Countries, basing his headquarters at Antwerp in present-day Belgium (then the Spanish Netherlands), where he became renowned for his adept market-play. Financial acumen=Rescues the pound When in 1551 the mismanagement of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, had caused the English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods ‚Äì highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair ‚Äî for raising the value of the pound sterling on the Antwerp bourse which proved so successful that in just a few years King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year. Later services to the Crown On the accession of Queen Mary in 1553 Gresham fell out of favour at Court for a short time with Alderman William Dauntsey displacing him. But Dauntsey's financial operations proved unsuccessful and Gresham was soon re-instated; and as he professed his zealous desire to serve the Queen, and manifested great adroitness both in negotiating loans and in smuggling money, arms and foreign goods, not only were his services retained throughout her reign (1553‚Äì1558), but besides his salary of twenty shillings per diem he received grants of church lands to the yearly value of 200 pounds. Under Queen Elizabeth's reign (1558‚Äì1603), besides continuing in his post as financial agent of the Crown, Gresham acted as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Court of Duchess Margaret of Parma, Governor of the Netherlands, and was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1559 prior to his departure. The unsettled times preceding the Dutch revolt compelled him to leave Antwerp on 10 March 1567; but, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued his business as merchant and government financial agent in much the same way as he had always done. His enterprises made him one of the richest men of his generation in England. Queen Elizabeth also found Gresham's abilities useful in a variety of other ways, including acting as gaoler to Lady Mary Grey (sister of Lady Jane Grey), who, as a punishment for marrying Thomas Keyes the sergeant-porter, was imprisoned in his house from June 1569 to the end of 1572. Founding of the Royal Exchange In 1565 Gresham made a proposal to the City's Court of Aldermen to build, at his own expense, a bourse or exchange ‚Äì what became the Royal Exchange, modelled on the Antwerp bourse;‚Äì on condition that the Corporation provided for this purpose a suitable location. In this proposal he seems to have had a good eye for his self-interest as well as for the general good of the City's merchants, for by a yearly rental of ¬£700 obtained for the shops in the upper part of the building he received more than sufficient return for his trouble and expense. The foundation of the Royal Exchange is the background of Thomas Heywood's play: If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody part 2, in which a Lord extols the quality of the building when asked if he has ever seen \\"a goodlier frame\\": :\\"Not in my life; yet I have been in Venice... In the Rialto there, called Saint Mark's; 'tis but a bauble, if compared to this. The nearest, that which most resembles this, is the great Burse in Antwerp, yet no comparable either in height or wideness, the fair cellarage, or goodly shops above. Oh my Lord Mayor, this Gresham hath much graced your City of London; his fame will long outlive him.\\"Heywood, Thomas, The Dramatic Works of Thomas Heywood, 6 volumes, ed. J. Payne Collier, London: The Shakespeare Society, 1851. Marriage and progeny In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of Sir William Read, a London merchant. By his wife he had an only son who predeceased him. He also had an illegitimate daughter who married Sir Nathaniel Bacon (c. 1546‚Äì1622), half-brother of Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Albans, becoming Anne, Lady Bacon. Death and burial Gresham died suddenly, apparently of apoplexy, on 21 November 1579 and was buried at St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate in the City of London.Memorials of the Institutions ‚Äì St Helen's Bishopgate Bequest for the foundation of Gresham College Apart from some small sums to various charities, Gresham bequeathed the bulk of his property (consisting of estates in London and around England giving an income of more than 2,300 pounds a year) to his widow and her heirs, with the stipulation that after her death his own house in Bishopsgate Street and the rents from the Royal Exchange should be vested in the Corporation of London and the Mercers Company, for the purpose of instituting a college in which seven professors should read lectures, one each day of the week, in astronomy, geometry, physic, law, divinity, rhetoric and music. Thus, Gresham College, the first institution of higher learning in London, came to be established in 1597. Gresham's Law Gresham's Law (stated simply as: \\"Bad money drives out good\\") takes its name from him (although others, including the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, had recognised the concept for years) because he urged Queen Elizabeth to restore the debased currency of England. However, Sir Thomas never formulated anything like Gresham's Law, which was the 1857 conception of Henry Dunning Macleod, an economist with a knack for reading into a text that which was not written.Roover, Raymond de, Gresham on Foreign Exchange, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1949 The Gresham grasshopper The Gresham family crest is: On a Mount Vert a Grasshopper Or,Burke's Armorials, 1884 (a golden grasshopper on a green mound); it is displayed by Gresham College, which he founded, and also forms the weathervane on the Royal Exchange in the City of London, also founded by him in 1565. The Faneuil Hall at Boston, Massachusetts, has also borrowed this heraldic device. The Gresham coat of arms is blazoned: Argent, a Chevron Ermin√©s between three Mullets pierced Sable.Burke's Armorials, 1884 According to ancient legend, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby among long grass in Norfolk during the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. Although a beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply a canting heraldic crest playing on the sound \\"grassh-\\" and \\"Gresh-\\".

On March 4, 1785, Lancaster County was split to form Dauphin County, named for the Dauphin of France, heir apparent to the French throne, whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. About two years later in August 1787 the legislature began to splinter Paxtang Township, first into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang and Lower Paxtang.

History Middletown was founded in 1755 along the left bank of the Susquehanna River and was incorporated as a borough in 1828 after a sudden boom in development and population occurred as a result of the construction of the Union Canal, connecting Lancaster to Middletown. Earlier in 1824 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's legislature authorized and funded the canal construction as part of the broad sweeping commercial initiative called the Main Line of Public Works; a forward looking project designing to connect Philadelphia to Pittsburgh by canals and river navigations which projects would continue to allow Philadelphia to challenge New York City (and its Erie Canal) for emerging mid-western markets beyond the Allegheny Mountains. Middletown was selected as the western terminus of the Union Canal, and it was named from its location halfway between Lancaster and Carlisle, where an ascent exists to a low pass allowing easier (wagon era) travelThe interstate highway I-70 connects the Pennsylvania Turnpike to Washington, D.C. today using the same corridor, as historically did several Class one Railroads. among the barrier mountains of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians giving access into north-central Maryland and the valley of the Potomac River.

The population was 2,557 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Harrisburg-Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Millersburg is located in northwestern Dauphin County on the east bank of the Susquehanna River at (40.541676, -76.957283). Wiconisco Creek enters the Susquehanna at the southern edge of the borough. According to the United States Census Bureau, Millersburg has a total area of , all of it land. Millersburg is the southwestern terminus of U.S. Route 209, which leads northeast to Pottsville and to its northeastern terminus north of Kingston, New York. Pennsylvania Route 147 passes through the center of Millersburg as Market Street, leading north (upriver) to Sunbury and south (downriver) to U.S. Route 22 near Duncannon. The Millersburg Ferry leads west across the Susquehanna to Buffalo Township in Perry County, allowing a connection to U.S. Routes 11 and 15. History Millersburg was founded in 1807 by Daniel Miller, for whom the town was named. The Millersburg Ferry and Millersburg Passenger Rail Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the spring of 1790, Daniel Miller and his brother, John were traveling north along the Susquehanna River. When they arrived at the north side of Berry's Mountain, tradition has it, Daniel was so taken with the beauty of the area where the Wiconisco Creek joined with the Susquehanna that he resolved to purchase the land at that location. On June 2, 1790, Miller received a deed for 979-1/4 acres at the mouth of the Wiconisco Creek from William Von Phul of Philadelphia, the owner of the land upon which Millersburg is now situated. In 1794, Miller built his first cabin that later served as a school in which he taught the children of the surrounding area without compensation. The building was on the site of the old Johnson-Baillie Shoe Company factory on Pine near Market Street. It was not until 1805, upon completion of a more suitable dwelling which still stands on the northeast corner of Pine and Walnut streets that Miller brought his wife, Elizabeth, and their two children to their new home. In 1807, Miller's dream of a town on the banks of the Susquehanna became a reality. During that year, he had the land surveyed and laid out into lots, reserving land for churches, the town square and a riverside park. Until a church could be built, Miller, who was a lay minister of the Methodist Church, held services in his own home. Transportation in Millersburg has always been a very important commodity to the community. Two major transportation projects were planned for Millersburg in the 19th century: one was the Lykens Valley R.R. & Coal Company, and the other was the extension of the Pennsylvania Canal, both proposed in the 1830s. The state began construction of the Wiconisco Canal as part of the Eastern Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in 1837. Millersburg was the northern terminus of the Dauphin County Canal network.

Millersburg ferry  The Millersburg Ferry The Millersburg Ferry, the last surviving ferry which crosses the Susquehanna River, and the last wooden-stern paddle-wheel ferry operating within the United States, operates out of Millersburg, which sits on the east side of the river. According to a sign posted at the ferry dock, a ferry has operated here since 1825. The original ferries were poled across the river. Paddle-wheel boats went into operation in 1873. The current ferries are wooden-stern paddle-wheelers which can carry up to four automobiles. The one-mile crossing goes to a point on the west side of the Susquehanna, in a campground near the point where Pennsylvania Route 34 meets U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 15, and near Liverpool. The ferry boats were officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The river at this location is very wide (approximately 1 mile) but is typically very shallow, sometimes only deep. The ferry follows a course across the river near a submerged man-made wall composed of river rocks and debris which provides slightly deeper clearance and prevents the ferry from grounding out.

Peaceable Kingdom Lost (p. 20). Oxford University Press. Kindle Edition. William Penn purchased the area known as Paxtang, or \\"Paxton\\". Paxtang is the site where Presbyterian Scots-Irish frontiersmen organized the Paxton Boys, a vigilante group that murdered twenty Native Americans in the Conestoga Massacre. On December 14, 1763, more than 50 Paxton Boys rode to the settlement near Millersville, Pennsylvania, murdered six Natives, and burned their cabin. Governor John Penn placed the remaining fourteen Conestogas in protective custody in Lancaster, but the Paxton Boys broke in, killed, and mutilated all fourteen people on December 27, 1763. In January 1764, 140 Natives living peacefully in eastern Pennsylvania fled to Philadelphia for protection. The Paxton Boys marched on Philadelphia in January 1764 with about 250 men. British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from doing more violence. Old Paxton Church Paxtang is home to the Old Paxton Church, one of the earliest in the area. Built in 1740, the church is the oldest Presbyterian Church building in continuous use in Pennsylvania, and the second oldest in the United States. In 1726, the Rev. James Anderson of Donegal, Pennsylvania, became the first regular preacher. The history of the church is interwoven with the history of central colonial Pennsylvania. In 1732, the congregation was officially organized as a Presbyterian Church by the Presbytery of Donegal, with the Rev. William Bertram as the first installed pastor. The Rev. John Elder, the \\"Fighting Parson,\\" became pastor in 1738. He was pastor during the French and Indian War and Revolutionary War, and served as a commissioned officer. Many of the church's pastors have served long pastorates; the terms of four of its ministers total 140 years. The present stone sanctuary was erected in 1740, replacing a log meeting house which had previously served as the place of worship. A stone marker south of the sanctuary indicates the site of the log building. A replica of the log meeting house was erected north of the present sanctuary. Adjacent to the church is a historic cemetery. Here lie the bodies of soldiers of the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and both World Wars. People who molded the early religious and political character of America are buried here, including John Harris II, William Maclay, the first United States senator from Pennsylvania, and four of the six commissioners who planned the town of Harrisburg with him in 1785. Ministers, legislators, farmers, teachers, men of affairs, and enslaved African Americans are buried here. For detailed information about the church, a 200-page book A History of Paxton Church, written by the Pastor Emeritus Morton Glise, is available for purchase from the church.

In 1845, Phillip Wolfsberger and Issac Hershey laid out the land and called it the village of Union Deposit. The name came about due to the area's use as a place to deposit goods meant to be transported on the Union Canal.

History of education The first school built in Bethel was in 1780 on the corner of Kirk and Foulk Road. In 1824, a school opened on a lot on Bethel Road East of Booth's Corner and was later known as public school No. 1. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Public School Act was passed by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth. The law required that every township, borough and city in the state provide a school for its children. Since Bethel Township already had a subscription school, the school was converted into a public school. The first school inspectors appointed for Bethel were Robert McCall and John Larkin. In 1839, a one-story octagonal school house was built at Booth's Corner and used for several years until destroyed by fire. In 1870, the school was replaced with a one-story structure was built and named School No. 2. A second story was added in 1898. The second floor was designated School No. 4 and used as student population necessitated. The building was sold on September 2, 1953 to Brigg's Auction. School No. 2 and No. 4 in Bethel Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania School No. 3 was built in 1860 on Bethel Road west of the village of Chelsea. The first non-single room school in Bethel Township, Francis Harvey Green School, was dedicated on November 9, 1951. The school was demolished in 2010. On July 1, 1964, Bethel agreed to join with Concord and Chester Heights Borough to form the Garnet Valley School District. On June 9, 1969, the Bethel Township School Board was dissolved.

History Brookhaven, Pennsylvania was originally part of a land grant given to William Penn in 1681 by King Charles II of England. The Proprietor negotiated with the Lenni-Lenape Indians, who were the original occupants of the land, the land was then divided into municipal districts. The area of Brookhaven was included in the Municipal District of Chester Township. 317 acres (1.3 km¬≤) were surveyed to Thomas Coebourn who settled in 1682 along with Richard Few who was granted 227 acres (0.9 km¬≤). Thomas Brassey was granted 385 acres (1.6 km¬≤) in 1684. These original grants were parceled eventually into smaller pieces of land and sold to subsequent settlers, such as Trimble, Edwards, Lister and Shepherd, among others. Many of these original settlers have streets named after them in the borough. The elementary school is named Coebourn Elementary (on Coebourn Blvd) after Thomas Coebourn and there are streets named Trimble, Edwards, Lister and Shepherd. For approximately two hundred and fifty years, the region was dependent upon a farming and dairy economy as well as two thriving mill businesses spanning both Chester Creek and Ridley Creek. Bisected by the 1687 Edgmont Great Road, Brookhaven developed into a town of small crossroads, at Sneath's Corners in the mid-19th century. The road from Hinkson's Corners (now Brookhaven Road), was established sometime before 1816 as a service road to the mills on Ridley and to Chester Creeks in 1847. These byways became major highways and at the crossroads of these two highways grew a cluster of services, professional offices and summer homes. In 1872, the name \\"Brookhaven\\" became most widely used after it was published in the letterhead of the Beatty Brothers General Store at Sneath's (later Beatty's) Corners. The Brookhaven community attracted numerous doctors and lawyers, and at the start of the 20th century, was a popular locale for Sunday outings amongst residents of the river tier communities. Brookhaven's mills were perhaps its most notable commercial activity. Thomas Coebourn established the second gristmill in the new Pennsylvania colony, successfully challenging William Penn's monopoly vested in the Caleb Pusey Mill (the Caleb Pusey house is still standing) downstream on Chester Creek. After a 1687 court battle went in Coebourne's favor and granted individuals the right to establish mills, the area's creeks powered a multitude of industries. The original Coebourne Log Mill was replaced in 1750 by a stone structure which was sold to Jonathan Dutton (Dutton Mill Road is a major road in the area) in 1792. A redrawing of Chester Township's borders in 1829 placed this site in present Middletown Township, with only the mill race and the owner's mansion in Brookhaven. The Johnson Ax Factory, the Lower Bank (Todmorden-Sackville) Hair Cloth Mills, Bickley's Gristmill and the Crozer Cloth Mill all utilized the notable drop for streams from the inland plateau to power their machinery. Both the 1826 and the post-flood 1844 mill surveys show large outputs for these factories. In the latter part of the 19th century, several large stock farms were thriving; by the 1900s most of these were consolidated under the ownership of John Price Crozer (the namesake of Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland) who bred racehorses and prize bulls. After Crozer's death and World War II, these farms were sold off to developers. In 1902, the New Chester Water Company built a filtration and storage facility which then serviced the entire city and Chester Township. This plant, on Harrison's Hill, opposite K-Mart, (K-Mart is now closed) is still in active use. The Delaware Valley's rapid industrial expansion and the resulting baby boom of World War II, brought increasing pressure for suburban housing. At the time of Brookhaven Borough's incorporation on April 4, 1945, the Borough had 672 persons and 150 homes. The trolley line which had run from Chester, Pennsylvania to Media via Edgmont Avenue stopped in 1938. The trolley tracks were removed in 1945 and the road was realigned and widened as most of the area's transportation had become automotive. In the last fifty years, Brookhaven has evolved very dramatically from a dairy and stock farm economy to a residential community of over 8,000 people living in over 3,600 homes, apartments and condominiums and supporting approximately 150 businesses.

The population was 2,531 at the 2010 census. Most of the borough lies south of U.S. 1, about a mile southwest of Wawa. History The history of Chester Heights predates grants of William Penn, when the Swedes had penetrated some distance inland from the Delaware River and had found the rich soil very conducive to productive farming. To a remarkable extent, the area had continued to be so used until the last decade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the borough was part of Aston Township, though this northernmost section of Aston did not have a village aspect as such. With the advent of a railroad, which made its first run-through on Christmas Day 1833, a concentration of houses developed. With the reach of the automobile, a settlement of homes sprang up along the oldest road in the borough. That route, now Valleybrook Road, was once known as the \\"Logtown Road\\" and was one of the earliest routes from Chester settlement to the interior. It wanders over and along the West Branch of Chester Creek and is noted for its abrupt curves at the borough's southern end. An 1836 school building on Valleybrook Road and Llewellyn Road was, in its day, rented by its owners to Aston for $2 a month for use as the school for this area. It was subsequently known as the Logtown School and changed to the Chester Heights School in 1880. A second, much later stone school building stands in its place today. The borough was the Fourth Ward of Aston and had been referred to for some time as Chester Heights and Wawa. It was in the northern or \\"Wawa\\" area that, over the past one hundred years or more, several large land parcels were acquired for summer residences. To date, most of these tracts have remained relatively unchanged, though they are now used as year-round private residences. (\\"Wawa\\" was the Indian name for wild goose.) In 1852 the cornerstone of St. Thomas the Apostle Church was laid, to house a Roman Catholic congregation that had been meeting on the property of the Willcox family since 1728. It stands today with the addition of a modern church, parochial school and residences. In 1872 an association of Methodists purchased a farm in Aston, incorporating as the Chester Heights Camp-Meeting Associations, and it still convenes each July for religious retreats. The borough of Chester Heights was officially incorporated in 1945. Today, approximately one dozen early fieldstone or brick dwellings remain intact, though not necessarily restored. The oldest homes date to 1720 or earlier; many of them were established by 1777 when \\"a number of the stragglers from the defeated American Army, hungry, demoralized and exhausted in their flight from the field at Brandywine, collected in the neighborhood of Logtown, where they passed the night, sleeping in the outbuildings and open fields.\\" Altogether, the houses represent an historically valuable span of 18th century to Victorian architecture in the borough.Henry Graham Ashmead, History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (1884), p. 293 The Chester Heights Camp Meeting Historic District, Chamberlain-Pennell House, and Stonehaven are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Chester Heights was also the home of the fictional Grogan family from the 2008 movie \\"Marley and Me\\". Geography Chester Heights is located in western Delaware County at (39.889539, -75.470931). It is bordered to the southeast by Aston Township, to the west by Concord Township, to the north by Thornbury Township, and to the northeast, across Chester Creek, by Middletown Township. U.S. Route 1 (Baltimore Pike) runs through the northern part of the borough, leading northeast to Philadelphia and southwest to Kennett Square. Chester is to the southeast via Valleybrook Road and Concord Road. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

History Concord Township is first mentioned in court records on June 27, 1683 when John Mendenhall was appointed constable of \\"Concord liberty\\". The paper for the first currency printed by the Continental Congress was made at the Ivy Mills founded by Thomas Willcox and Thomas Brown. The Ivy Mills was the second oldest paper mill in the United States. The mill made printing paper for Benjamin Franklin and paper for currency for several Continental governments, the US government and many South American countries. The oldest Roman Catholic parish in Pennsylvania began as a mission at the home of the Willcox family in 1730. The church was later moved approximately one mile east to the top of the hill into what later would become the Borough of Chester Heights and is known as St. Thomas the Apostle Church. In 1702, the St. John's Episcopal Church was founded on land donated by John Hannum, a successful farmer and tavern owner who was baptized by the former Quaker George Keith. Keith was known to conduct services at the Hannum home on Concord Road. The Newlin Grist Mill has been grinding grain since 1704. It has an tall stone wheel housed in a timber frame. The mill and processing complex had later passed through various hands, but in the 1950s it was purchased by a direct descendant of Nicholas Newlin, which along with of surrounding countryside became the Newlin Mill Historic Park. The mill complex area was home to the Markham post office and Markham train station (Philadelphia/Baltimore rail traffic) The name \\"Concord\\" was believed to have been given by the earliest European settlers of the township and reflects the harmonious feelings among them at the time. Title to all real estate in the township can be traced back to a grant from William Penn. Concord Township was a part of Chester County until 1789, at which point Delaware County was created by act of legislature. Farmers in the northern and western reaches of Chester County were weary of travelling a period of days to get to the county seat in Chester, on the Delaware River. The seat of Chester County was moved to Turk's Head, now West Chester, and was centrally located in the county.

During World War I, Remington Arms opened the Eddystone Rifle Plant on Baldwin land with Baldwin management. Here it produced the Pattern 1914 Enfield rifle and M1917 Enfield rifle. A large portion of the rifles used by American soldiers in France in World War I were made at Eddystone.. In January 1918 Remington Arms was absorbed by Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company, which took over the rifle plant.. Baldwin also formed a subsidiary company (Eddystone Ammunition Corporation) in 1915 to build artillery shells (Russian-model on British order). On 10 April 1917, 133 people were killed in an explosion at the artillery shell plant. A monument near the Edgmont Avenue side of the Chester Rural Cemetery marks the final resting place for the remains of the unidentified victims, mostly women and young girls.Eddystone Disaster In 1917 the U.S. government also placed artillery shell orders, and bought out some of the assets of the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation.

Delmar Drive was once part of Calcon Hook Road. Calcon is the Swedish word for \\"turkey,\\" and Hook is the Swedish word for \\"road\\". The original road was a Leni Lenape trail called \\"Turkey's Neck Trail\\" by the settlers, and was no more than wide. Originally productive farmlands, it became a residential suburb of Philadelphia with the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad through the area in 1874. A passenger stop was built and named Folcroft, or \\"leafy fields\\". Originally part of Darby Township, Folcroft was incorporated as a borough in 1922. In August 1963, the Baker family became the first African-American family to purchase a house in Folcroft in the Delmar village complex. When local white resident learned of the purchase, the house was vandalized and a crowd of over a thousand people prevented the Baker family from entering their home. 100 Pennsylvania State Troopers were required to control the crowd and allow the Baker's to enter their home.

Environmental issues Through the grassroots support of local citizens, organizations and politicians, Congress declared Tinicum Marsh along Darby Creek a National Wildlife Refuge in 1972. The John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum is just one of over 530 national wildlife refuges managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In the shadow of Philadelphia, visitors can watch pintail ducks feeding, red- bellied turtles basking, butterflies flitting, and foxes play. With just of marshes, fields, streams and forests, the refuge is small in area but significant biologically. Tinicum's Marshes, along with other wetlands in the Delaware estuary, are the nursery for commercial and sport fisheries along the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Lower Darby Creek Area on the National Priorities List in June 2001. The site consists of two landfills: the Clearview Landfill and the Folcroft Landfill and Annex. EPA held a meeting in September 2001 to inform the community that the Lower Darby Creek Area is now a Superfund site. The Lower Darby Creek Area site consists of two landfills, the Clearview Landfill and the Folcroft Landfill and Annex, along Darby Creek in Philadelphia and Delaware counties. Clearview Landfill is on the east side of Darby Creek, and about downstream is the Folcroft Landfill/Annex on the west side of Darby Creek. The Folcroft Landfill/Annex is part of the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The two landfills operated from the 1950s to the 1970s and were eventually closed in the mid-1970s. During operation they disposed of a variety of waste including municipal, demolition, and hospital waste. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service owns the Folcroft Landfill/Annex and, accordingly, they will have the lead on cleaning it up. Presently, EPA is in discussions with potentially responsible parties to form a group to perform the RI/FS at the Folcroft Landfill/Annex.

The population was 2,397 at the 2010 census. The current mayor is Gene Taylor. The borough calls itself \\"The Cornerstone of Pennsylvania\\". The 2005 film One Last Thing... was set and partially filmed in Marcus Hook. History The earliest inhabitants of Marcus Hook were the Lenape Indians and their indigenous ancestors, whose succeeding cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years. The Lenape had a major settlement in Marcus Hook; New Sweden colonists established a trading post here in the 1640s. The village was called Chammassungh, or \\"Finland\\" by the Swedes. It was located on the west side of the Delaware River, between Marcus Hook Creek and Naamans Creek. Dutch colonists renamed the settlement as \\"Marrites Hoeck\\" after they conquered the area in 1655. The name is derived from the word Hook, meaning promontory, or point of land projecting into the water and Marcus, a corruption of the name of the Indian chief, called Maarte by the Dutch, who lived at the Hook. English colonists gained control of the Dutch colonies and founded St. Martin's Church in 1699; the new church opened for worship in 1702. Walter Martin of Upper Chichester founded this church as an alternative place of worship and burial for Christian non-Quakers. Marcus Hook became a prosperous community and market town and in 1708 was of equal prominence to nearby Chester, Pennsylvania, with each location having approximately 100 houses. In the early 1700s, Marcus Hook was a haven for pirates who plagued the lower Delaware River. The market at Marcus Hook provided the pirates a place to sell plundered goods and re-supply away from the authorities and custom officials in Philadelphia. Early maps of Marcus Hook show the current Second Street was originally named \\"Discord Lane\\", since it was the location of the pirates' revelry when they were in town. According to a local oral tradition, the Marcus Hook Plank House was once the home of the mistress of the pirate Blackbeard. By the mid-1700s, Marcus Hook became a major regional center for the building of wooden sailing ships and remained so until the late 19th century. By that time, larger tonnage ships became more popular than the sloops and schooners built in Marcus Hook. During the American Revolutionary War, two tiers of underwater chevaux-de-frise obstacles were placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook to provide a first line of defense of Philadelphia against British naval forces. Marcus Hook also served as a training center for the Pennsylvania militia. The Continental Army was stationed at Marcus Hook during the fall of 1777. As the town was bombarded by British warships more than once, there are very few pre-Revolutionary houses in Marcus Hook. Marcus Hook served as a defensive post along the Delaware River during the War of 1812, with over 5,000 United States troops placed there. The borough was officially incorporated on March 7, 1892. The convergence of rail, roads, a deepwater port, and the nation's growing thirst for petroleum gave rise to the refineries that became the borough's dominant industry. Sun Oil opened the Marcus Hook refinery in 1901 to refine crude oil brought by ship from Texas. It was the first of seven major refineries that made up the largest fuel-manufacturing center in the Northeast. The refinery was closed in 2011 due to deteriorating market conditions. In 1910, the American Viscose Corporation opened a plant in Marcus Hook for the production of rayon and other synthetic fibers.

Media was incorporated in 1850 at the same time that it was named the county seat. The population was 5,327 at the 2010 census, down from 5,533 at the 2000 census. In June 2006, it became the first fair trade town in America.First Free Trade Town History The history of the area goes back to William Penn, but the area remained predominantly rural until the twentieth century. Land in the area was sold and settled soon after William Penn was named proprietor of the colony of Pennsylvania in 1681 by King Charles II of England. Peter and William Taylor bought the land where Media is now located, directly from Penn.Media: A Walking Tour, published by the Borough of Media, 1990 At the time, the land was located in Chester County. Providence Township was organized in 1684, and later divided into Upper Providence and Nether Providence townships by 1690, even though they only had 40 taxable properties at the time.History of Delaware CountyNether Providence Through the Years (Delaware County Historical Society) The current borough, formed in 1850, sits between the two townships. In 1683, the Court of Chester County approved the construction of \\"Providence Great Road\\" (now Pennsylvania Route 252). The road, which runs north from Chester to within a few blocks of today's downtown, is shown on a 1687 map along with the names of local landowners.The City of Philadelphia Two Miles in Length and One in Breadth (Lower Merion Historical Society) It forms the eastern border of the borough. Thomas Minshall, a Quaker, was an early Media resident, settling just outside the small village then known as \\"Providence\\", along the Providence Great Road. The village then included a tailor shop, blacksmith shop, wheelwright shop, barn and other buildings. Minshall bought from William Penn and arrived in 1682. The Providence Friends Meeting was established at his house in February 1688, and a meetinghouse was later built on land he donated for the purpose. The original meetinghouse was built out of logs in 1699 or 1700, and the current building dates to 1814. A house on Minshall's property, built c. 1750, still stands and was given to the citizens of the borough in 1975. Chester County, Pennsylvania was divided in 1789, the eastern portion becoming Delaware County, Pennsylvania. The area in the center of the new county remained rural through 1850. On March 11, 1850, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by Special Act of Assembly incorporated the Borough of Media, and made the sale of malt and spirituous liquors unlawful within its borders. At the same time, the county seat of Delaware County was moved to Media from Chester. The borough was formed from four farms purchased by the county, totaling only . The borders of the borough have not changed since that time. Streets were plotted in a rectangular grid around the location of the new courthouse, lots were sold at public auctions, and the construction of houses began. Sources agree that Minshall Painter, a descendant of Thomas Minshall, suggested the name \\"Media\\", but do not agree on the reason. The name most likely comes from the borough's central location in Delaware County. In 1940, the Pennsylvania guide described Media by noting that \\"[t]he majority of its houses, almost all built since the Civil War, sit far back on shaded lawns and seem somewhat gloomy. The borough has a large and prosperous business section and a few small industrial plants; many townspeople work in Philadelphia or Chester.\\" The John J. Tyler Arboretum occupies part of Thomas Minshall's original . This farm was used by the Underground Railroad.Loretta Rodgers, \\"The Trackless Train: Tracking Delco's Role in the Underground Railroad\\" (Feb. 27, 1989), Delaware County Daily Times The land was donated to a public trust in 1944 by an eighth-generation descendant. The arboretum was started as a private collection by brothers Jacob and Minshall Painter. In 1825, they began systematically planting over 1,000 varieties of trees and shrubs. Over twenty of their original trees survive, including a giant sequoia. Minshall Painter was also a leader of the Delaware County Institute of Science, which was formed on September 21, 1833, with just four other members: George Miller, John Miller, George Smith, M.D., and John Cassin. The institute was incorporated in 1836. About 1850, Painter gave the institute the land where its building currently stands at 11 Veterans Square, and the building was constructed in 1867. In the second half of the 19th century, Media was a summer resort for well-to-do Philadelphians. The borough's large vacation hotels included the Idlewild Hotel (1871) on Lincoln Street at Gayley Terrace, Chestnut Grove House or \\"The Colonial\\" (1860) on Orange Street, and Brooke Hall on Orange Street and Washington Avenue (now Baltimore Avenue). The Chestnut Grove was used for a year by nearby Swarthmore College due to a fire on its campus. The West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad was built through Media on October 19, 1854. Electrified service was opened on December 2, 1928. Up to 50 trains passed through each day. The railroad became part of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and eventually the Penn Central. SEPTA took over operations in 1983. Woodrow Wilson spoke at the Media Station in 1912 during his first election campaign. Trolley transportation lines spread to and through Media in the 1890s and early 1900s. 200x200px200x200px200x200pxThe Media Theatre opened as a vaudeville house in 1927.The Media Theatre for the Performing Arts - History The first 'talkie' film, The Jazz Singer, was shown there. It remained a popular cinema through the 1970s and 1980s. In 1994, the theater underwent a $1 million restoration by Walter Strine Sr. and re-opened as the 'Media Theatre for the Performing Arts'. Shows produced there have included The Full Monty, Carousel and Miss Saigon. On March 8, 1971, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI raided an FBI \\"resident agency\\" in Media. They later released thousands of documents to major newspapers around the country. These documents revealed FBI tactics, like the recruitment of Boy Scouts as informants, and confirmed for the first time the existence of COINTELPRO, an FBI program to \\"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize\\" dissident groups in the United States. In June 2006, Media became the first town in the United States to follow over 300 towns in Europe in attaining fair trade certification. To meet the criteria for certification, Media passed a council resolution in support of fair trade, served fair-trade coffee and tea in local government meetings and offices, ensured that a range of fair-trade products were available in local restaurants and businesses, raised popular support and provided media coverage for the fair-trade campaign, and convened a fair-trade steering committee to ensure continued commitment.

The population was 1,159 at the 2010 census. Millbourne borders Philadelphia along Cobbs Creek. The borough is not part of neighboring Upper Darby, although Millbourne students attend Upper Darby School District schools. Magisterial courts with presiding jurisdiction for Millbourne are also located in Upper Darby. Millbourne, at over 16,000 people per square mile, is the most densely populated incorporated place in Pennsylvania, and 22nd in the entire United States. Geography Millbourne Borough is located at (39.963412, -75.253998). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2), all land, making it the smallest municipality in Delaware County, Pennsylvania by area. The borough is small enough that it is entirely within walking distance of its elevated station on the Market-Frankford Line. The Millbourne station, newly rebuilt and rededicated in mid-2008, offers an 11-minute commute to University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University and a 15-minute commute to Center City. Millbourne is also within easy walking distance of the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby and the 63rd Street Station in West Philadelphia, both of which are on the Market-Frankford Line. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in the early 21st century that, according to U.S. Census data, only about one-third of Millbourne workers commuted by car. There is a PhillyCarShare shared car \\"node\\" at 69th Street Station, easily accessible from Millbourne or by commuters exiting the Market Frankford El at 69th Street. The Borough is approximately bounded on the north and east by Cobbs Creek, and on the south by Market Street. The creek is graced by an historic mill dam and a bridge said to be eligible for placement on national historic registries. Across Cobbs Creek to the north lies an extension of Fairmount Park and the Cobbs Creek Golf Course. Snowy egrets have been seen in this very urban creek environment. Cobbs Creek originally hosted the Millbourne Mills, a flour mill, and slightly further south in Upper Darby the first mill in the country, established by Ben Franklin at the corner of 63rd Street and Walnut Street. In the 19th century the Cardington Mill (cotton) was built nearby along Naylor's Run. A paper mill existed around the time of the Civil War somewhat farther north-west on Cobbs Creek, near the current site of the 69th Street Station repair yard. The paper was used to wrap guns for the war. Demographics The borough is the most densely populated municipality in Pennsylvania with 16,557 people living per square mile.The Center for Rural Pennsylvania As of Census 2010, the racial makeup of the borough was 13.7% White, 20.1% African American, 0.6% Native American, 56.3% Asian, 0.9% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 4.1% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races.

The per capita income for the borough was $15,752. About 7.8% of families and 10.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.0% of those under age 18 and 16.9% of those age 65 or over. Economy Millbourne was the home of the Millbourne Mills, a grain mill originally established in the 18th century by the Sellers family, and closed in 1927. The old mill dam is still visible on the creek today, as is an arch that covered a rail line serving the Mill. Later, a Sears department store was located on a plot of land at the north eastern end of Millbourne on what is commonly thought to be a flood plain for Cobbs Creek. The Sears department store, through mercantile tax, provided approximately half of the Borough's revenues. It was relocated to the corner of Walnut Street and 69th Street in Upper Darby in 1992. This relocation has caused significant financial difficulties for the Borough, which now has one of the top two tax rates in Delaware County. Millbourne was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1993 by the state of Pennsylvania. The Borough requested removal from distressed status in approximately 2006, but has since applied for status as a \\"blighted\\" community. A blight certification request was completed by the Delaware County Planning Department in 2006. Culture House in Millbourne In 2000, 40.2% of Millbourne residents identified themselves as being of Asian Indian heritage. This was the highest percentage of Indian Americans of any place in the United States. Millbourne is also the only community in Pennsylvania, and the only community outside California, New Jersey, and Hawaii with an Asian American majority. Millbourne is home to a gurudwara, where the Philadelphia Sikh Society holds services. There is a mosque about a quarter mile away in Upper Darby, PA. A number of residents originate from Kerala, a south-western state of India and there is a major Keralite arts and culture fair held annually nearby in Upper Darby. The Borough boasts an expert in the ancient art of Cambodian court dance. Fire protection is provided by the Millbourne Fire Company in partnership with the Upper Darby Fire Department. The Borough also maintains its own police department, which provides frequent coverage of each street. Millbourne has a Town Watch, a volunteer organization run in cooperation with the police department. The Upper Darby/Sellers Memorial Free Library Municipal Branch is within easy walking distance of Millbourne. A library card from the Upper Darby system allows access to the county-wide libraries, and offers an excellent inter-library loan program as well as many local resources. A myriad of ethnic grocery stores are also within easy walking distance, allowing residents to buy home-made tofu, a wide range of Punjabi and other Indian foods, Halal chicken and lamb, a wide range of Asian greens, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean-made foods, Central American foods, and mainstream American foods within minutes of their homes. Korean, Mexican, Peruvian, Colombian, Vietnamese, Caribbean, southern rib, Punjabi and an award-winning pizza restaurant (and, until recently, a Filipino-owned restaurant where adobo was served) are all within walking distance. The Cobbs Creek Bikeway runs from a corner at the eastern end of Millbourne, 63rd and Market Streets, to approximately 86th and Cobbs Creek Parkway. It is used by walkers and bicyclists as well as occasional all terrain vehicles. Plans exist to eventually connect this bikeway to the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge. These plans got a boost from a TIGER grant allowing planning for the 58th Street Connector. There is some support for a rail-with-trail bike path along SEPTA's Route 100 line from Radnor to 69th Street. The adjacent town, Upper Darby, is studying feasibility of a walking path on another old rail right of way, the Newtown Square Branch, which might eventually feed into Millbourne. For bicyclists, it is feasible outside of rush hour to take a bicycle on the Market Frankford Line to reach 30th Street, and bicycle along the Schuylkill River Path to Valley Forge, and the Perkiomen Creek trail to Collegeville or beyond. The Millbourne Borough Council re-established a paper recycling program in approximately 2009, which was discontinued due to vandalism of the paper bins. County \\"igloos\\" for recycling glass are located behind the auto parts store approximately at the corner of Powell Lane and Market Street. The county offers recycling of electronics periodically. Across Market Street, just inside Upper Darby on the eastern end of town, there's a community garden. There's a bit of a wait for a plot. Farther east of the garden, also in Upper Darby, is the Life Center of Eastern Delaware County. This is a 50-bed homeless shelter for individual adults. Many residents of Millbourne volunteer serving or making food at this facility, which is quiet, well-run and well maintained. Community clean-ups are held a few times a year on a volunteer basis, often followed by a barbecue or pot-luck. Health care services are available about a mile away at the ChesPenn Family Health Center of Upper Darby, whether or not a patient has health insurance, and hospitals abound in the Philadelphia area easily accessible by car or the Market Frankford El. Delaware County Memorial Hospital (accessible by car or by the Route 101 or 102 trolleys) is a few miles away. After decades of Republican majority, the Borough has recently become majority Democratic in terms of registration. As of January 4, 2010 the Borough leadership is bi-partisan, consisting of 4 Democrats and 1 Independent on Council, and a Republican Mayor.

Prior to 1789 it was part of Chester County. The population was 12,216 as of the 2010 census, and was 19,705 as of 2017. History The first mention of the township was in 1684, when Thomas Norbury and John Humphrey were appointed collectors of the \\"Levie for the cort house and Prison for ye Township of Newtowne\\". Newtown Square was the name used for the townstead with the majority of early settlers being Welshmen. These Welsh \\"Friends\\" (Quakers) needed a road to facilitate their journey to meeting, the only established road at the time being Newtown Street Road, which ran north and south. As such, in 1687, an east‚Äìwest road was laid out (Goshen Road) so the Friends could attend either Goshen or the Haverford Friends Meeting. By 1696, these friends had become numerous enough to hold their own meeting in Newtown and continued to meet in a private home until the completion of the Newtown Square Friends Meetinghouse in 1711. In the 18th century, Newtown was basically a farming community. Blacksmith and wheelwright shops emerged on the main arteries to service horse and buggy travelers. Taverns and inns were also opened to accommodate local patrons as well as drovers taking their livestock to the markets in Philadelphia. During the Revolutionary War, Newtown township was visited several times by foraging parties of the British Army. On Goshen Road, west of Newtown Square, were the outpost and headquarters of General Potter. During the 19th century a number of mills sprang up along Crum Creek (the western border) and Darby Creek (in the northeast corner of the Township). These included saw mills, paper mills, shingle mills, and a woolen factory. In the Darby Creek area a number of tenement houses were built as well as a general store to service the needs of the mill workers. Municipal Building and library In 1860, the population of Newtown Township was 830; the population of Philadelphia was approximately half a million. At this time, the railroad was laying track out of Philadelphia in all directions with services to Chester, Media, West Chester, and Radnor, but not Newtown Square. As these towns, as well as stops along the way, grew and prospered, mills closed and businesses declined in Newtown Square. By 1890, the population had fallen to 648. As an agricultural community, stone farmhouses graced the country landscape throughout the 19th century. Additions were made to the early simple dwellings as families grew and more living space was required. Prosperity, due to a growing market, also enabled property owners to make additions, not only to their own homes, but on the property as well as in the form of tenements and outbuildings. In 1859, the Rose Tree Hunt Club was organized south of the township, followed by the Lima Hunt Club to the west (1885) and the Radnor Hunt Club at the intersection of Darby-Paoli and Goshen Roads in 1886. With these developments, many country estates were built in the rolling hills of Newtown Square for \\"either country gentlemen of Old Quaker blood ... or rich Philadelphians who loved hunting, owned good horses, and were not afraid to ride them.\\" Major transportation developments for the Township did not occur until the mid-1890s, when trolley service was opened to Newtown Square. Before this time, railroad lines had been proposed, but due to a series of reorganizations and competition between companies for rights of way, as of 1892 no track had been laid. In 1894, however, a mule-drawn service was initiated by the Philadelphia and Delaware County Railroad, with steam dummies used to help out on the hills. Electrification was completed the following year and the trolley was open from Newtown to Fernwood in 1895. By 1889, the reorganized Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company had completed the track to West Chester. Aronimink Golf Club, which has hosted the 1962 PGA Championship, the 1977 U.S. Amateur, the 1997 U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, 2003 Senior PGA Championship, and the 2010 and 2011 AT&T; National is in Newtown Township. At the turn of the 20th century, the automobile began to disperse the urban populations over the countryside. The trolleys, along with automobiles transformed the country farmers into suburban commuters. Farms were sold and the land subdivided. Newtown Square boomed. Many city dwellers retained their country estates; however, these became hidden amidst gridiron developments. Although construction slackened during the depression, another boom was experienced after World War II. Today Newtown Township has a land area of , and a population of 12,216 individuals. Some farms and large estates remain, but for the most part, the township was developed into a suburban community with old stone homes and structures dotting the landscape to serve as reminders of days gone by.

These properties formed the current community of Prospect Park. Prospect Hill Baptist Church in Prospect Park claims a prominent role in instituting the phrase \\"In God We Trust\\" on United States coins and currency. A former pastor, Mark R. Watkinson, felt that the Civil War was going to leave the country with a bad name, \\"brother fighting brother in a civil war\\", and wrote a letter to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting \\"God, Liberty, Law,\\" be put on the coins. Chase referred the matter to James B. Longacre, Mint Engraver. A committee later settled on \\"In God We Trust\\", and the words first appeared on a 2-cent coin. A plaque on the outside of the church announces the birthplace of the phrase.

The Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, PA) August 17, 2004  History =Native American The Lenape inhabited the Delaware River region several centuries before the arrival of European explorers and traders. The Okehocking Tribe of the Lenni Lenape Nation established small permanent villages along the river and its main tributaries. Land adjacent to Stoney Creek in Ridley Township has been identified as a Native American town site. Historians also believe that additional villages may have existed at other locations along Stoney Creek and Crum Creek in Ridley Park. Native Americans significantly influenced the built environment through their network of paths laid out for travel and communication purposes. Their footpaths through the densely forested countryside grew into the first roads of the area. Chester Pike is believed to have developed from a footpath created by the Lenni Lenape as their main thoroughfare in the area.A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, edited by John W. Jordan, LL. D., published by Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York 1914 Colonial The borough is named after a place in Cheshire, England. John Morton, signer of the American Declaration of Independence, was born and raised in a log cabin adjacent to East Ridley Avenue.

Known then as the ‚ÄúQueens Highway,‚Äù it was one of the region's first roads stretching from Chester to Darby, and by 1715, it reached Philadelphia.

The population of the area continued to increase after the American Revolutionary War. Consequently, a private elementary subscription school was founded in 1800 on a site at Chester Pike and Myrtle Avenue. This was one of the first schools in Delaware County.Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware 1630-1707 (edited by Albert Cook Myers.

He wanted to expand the company's rail line to gain more business in the same way the Pennsylvania Railroad had earlier created a Main Line from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia to Paoli. The Pennsylvania Railroad bought up farmland and developed towns all along its rail line. City dwellers, seeking relief from the urban crowds with their potential to spread malaria a disease that was a major health concern at the time, quickly purchased the new homes being built. Seeing the success of this, Hinckley came up with the idea of putting in a rail line that would pass through Darby and continue all the way to the semi-rural city of Chester in what became known as the Darby ImprovementHistory of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Henry Graham Ashmead, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co. 1884 Hinckley's plans met with initial resistance from farmers, and at the end of the first year, he had managed to buy only one farm. Undaunted, he traveled further south on Chester Pike to the area now known as Ridley Park.History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. By Henry Graham Ashmead Philadelphia:L. H. Everts & Co.1884 In an effort to avoid his previous bad experience, in May 1871, Hinckley formed an association to acquire the land. Hinckley hired Robert Morris Copeland, a noted Boston landscape architect, to develop a master plan for a suburban park community which became known as the Borough of Ridley Park. Copeland's design is Delaware County's first planned community. Because of its beautifully landscaped streets and parks, and its man-made lake, Ridley Park became popular in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century as a summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians who built most of the Victorian style homes still lived in today.The history of Ridley Park by Keith Lockhart Published in 1987, K. Lockhart (Ridley Park; Pa.) Between January and May 1870, many farms were purchased. The streets in the new development were named after the families who sold their farmland. Names such as Burk, Dutton, Free, Henderson, Stewart and Ward, are still used today. The first train of passengers-cars stopped at Ridley Park on October 19, 1872. By that time, the town had a hotel, and a dam had been built across Crum Creek, creating a lake. By 1880, the U.S. census return recorded the population of Ridley Park as 439. The railroad was, and continues today to be an integral part of the town.History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. By Henry Graham Ashmead Philadelphia: L. H.

Transportation Ridley Park station is a SEPTA train station on the Wilmington/Newark Line. Chester Pike (U.S. Route 13), leads northeast through the borough to the center of Philadelphia and southwest to Chester. Interstate 95 also briefly passes through the borough, exit 8 serving Ridley Park directly. Education=Primary and secondary schoolsPublic schools= The borough is served by the Ridley School District. It consists of Ridley Township, and the boroughs of Ridley Park and Eddystone. The district has one high school, one middle school, and seven elementary schools. At all levels, the schools use the Green Raiders as their mascot. While originally the Raiders referred to Native Americans from the Lenni Lenape Nation, the district has ceased use of most material relating to the tribe. Ridley High School is home to the WRSD radio station. =Parochial schools= The St. James Regional, formerly St. Madeline-St. Rose School, serves grades 1st through 8. Originally, these were two separate parishes but in 1993, with declining enrollments, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia consolidated the St. Madeline Parish in Ridley Park, and the St. Rose of Lima Parish in nearby Eddystone. The Archdiocese had an area wide consolidation of schools due to declining enrollment. The school is now called St. James Regional School after combining with St. Gabriel's in Norwood in 2012. The name originated from the former St. James High School for Boys in Chester. The St. James High alumni association suggested the name, and the new school asked to use not only the name but also the mascot and colors. When it opened it had 402 students, with around 201 being from St. Gabriel. Cardinal O'Hara High School, serving grades 9 through 12, is a coeducational school located in Springfield, and serves the Ridley Park, Chester, Swarthmore, and Springfield area. Religion The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operates Catholic churches. St. Madeline Church, established in 1908, is in Ridley Park. The number of parishioners decreased by 20% from 2008 to 2012, with 4,720 congregants in the latter year. In popular culture The 2012 movie Silver Linings Playbook takes place in and around Ridley Park, which is credited at the end of the film.

Its area is , and the population was 913 at the 2010 census. The area was settled by Quaker farmers in 1682, and later water mills along Ridley Creek drove manufacturing in the nineteenth century. In 1901 Rose Valley was founded as an Arts and Crafts community by architect Will Price, who bought of land around the former Rose Valley textile mill. Price was a follower of Henry George's economics (Georgism). Price also co-founded Arden, Delaware, a utopian single tax community based on Henry George's economic model. Nevertheless, the Georgist single-tax ideal was never implemented in Rose Valley. Crafts works soon foundered, leaving a legacy of impressive architecture, a preserved landscape, and a regional theatre, the Hedgerow Theatre (founded in 1923), as well as an artistic community that includes writers, painters, and architects. As a former mayor said, \\"Rose Valley is an island of non-conformity.\\"Peter Laird, History (Vol. I), p. vii The Rose Valley Historic District, covering essentially all of the borough, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Note: This includes History Native Americans of the Leni Lenape or Delaware tribe lived in the area when Europeans began arriving. A major trade route, the Great Minquas Path, passed through the site of the present borough, along Long Point, a hairpin turn in Ridley Creek, and then across the creek and through the center of the borough. Furs were carried along the path from Native Americans on the Susquehanna River to European traders on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers. Soon after William Penn received his charter for the Colony of Pennsylvania, three brothers, Thomas, Robert, and Randall Vernon, received land grants from Penn to settle over in the present borough of Rose Valley and Nether Providence Township. The brothers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1682 and began farming the area, about north of Chester, which was then the largest settlement in the colony. Though the brothers purchased their land in 1681 while still in London, the land was not surveyed and patents were not granted for the land until years, perhaps decades, later. The Providence Great Road (now PA 252), just to the north of the borough, was laid out in the 1680s, and Brookhaven Road, on the borough's eastern boundary, was laid out in 1705.Peter Ham, History (Vol. I) Randall Vernon's house was built before 1700, and still stands. Robert Vernon may have built the house known as the \\"Bishop White House\\" about 1695. The name of the house comes from its use by the family of Bishop William White during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 in Philadelphia. Though the bishop visited the house, he generally stayed in Philadelphia in 1793. Will Price modified this house after 1900, adding a stone porch and red tile roof. The Vernon families continued living in the area into the nineteenth century. The American Revolution split family members, who served as soldiers on both the American and British sides. Many veterans of the Revolution are buried in now unmarked graves in the cemetery of the Old Union Methodist Church, the only church in the borough. The roots of the church may go back to 1804, and it was officially organized in 1811. The current building dates to 1835. Following the Revolution, land in the southwest corner of the present borough was confiscated from a Vernon family member who had supported the British. The land was eventually sold to Jacob Benninghove, a Philadelphia tobacconist, who built a large mansion there in 1787. About the same time, he built a dam on Ridley Creek and a water-powered snuff mill. Samuel Bankcroft bought the house in 1831 and named it Todmorden Mansion. He lost the house in bankruptcy in 1842, but bought it back in 1857 and lived there until 1889. He built tunnels and secret chambers in the house for use in the Underground Railroad.

At least three mills operated in the area of Rose Valley. Little remains except a silted-in dam pond of what may have been the earliest mill, located on Vernon Run near the present Pool and Tennis Club. Near the Bishop White House, on Ridley Creek, the remains of a dam and millrace can be seen leading up to the \\"Old Mill\\", which is now used as the town hall. Benninghove's snuff mill was likely built here c. 1789. Between 1826 and 1850 it was run as a paper mill. It was reconstructed as a textile mill in 1861 and burned down in 1885. After 1900 Will Price built a furniture mill or craft shop on the foundations and later it was used as a meeting hall. After extensive fire damage, it was reconstructed into today's town hall. Hutton's mill, on Rose Valley Road by Vernon Run, was built about 1840 as a feed mill. In 1847 it became a turning mill. It was used to produce bobbins for the nearby textile mill as well as serving as a warehouse. Later it produced sandpaper. Will Price also reconstructed this mill into a meeting house and theater. It also suffered fire damage, was again reconstructed, and now houses the Hedgerow Theatre. Arts and crafts project Under the leadership of Will Price, the Rose Valley Association was formed in July 1901 to start an arts and crafts project and buy about of land, an area that is the nucleus of today's borough. Investors contributed about $25,000 in capital, including $9,000 borrowed from nearby Swarthmore College to buy and improve the land. Price's vision may have been modelled on the utopian socialist society described in News from Nowhere by William Morris.George E. Thomas, History (Vol. I), Ch. IX Price's liberal views led to some misconceptions about the project, according to his niece Eleanore Price Mather: \\"First, it was not a free love colony. Second it was not single tax .... And third, it was not communistic. Rose Valley was essentially an arts and crafts project.\\"Eleanore Price Mather, History (Vol. I), p. 13 Price had led a discussion group, including Edward Bok and brothers Samuel and Joseph Fels, and many in this group became investors or residents in Rose Valley. Other early residents included Hawley McLanahan, who became Price's architectural partner; McLanahan's father-in-law Charles T. Schoen; Price's employees at his architectural firm; and his relatives, including his brother Walter, also an architect. Feminist Anna Howard Shaw lived nearby. Administration of the project was in the form of a town meeting, called the \\"Folk Mote\\". The old bobbin mill now houses Hedgerow Theatre. The Rose Valley Association did not produce arts and crafts itself, but rather rented out working space to craftsmen, and provided them housing, generally designed or renovated by Price. The crafts were sold from Price's office at 1624 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. Furniture, as well as ceramics and book binding, were produced at the Old Mill until about 1907. A journal, The Artsman, was published from 1903-1907. An art gallery was located in the old bobbin mill, then called \\"Artsman's Hall\\", and, starting in 1904, run by well-known artist Alice Barber Stephens, who lived in the mill until a nearby barn was converted by Price into her house, Thunderbird Lodge. Artsman's Hall was also used for theater, with the first play The Carpet Bagger's Revenge presented on New Year's Eve, 1904. Eventually the building became used solely by the Hedgerow Theatre, which is still active. By 1910, however, craft production had faded and the community had become essentially a commuter suburb of Philadelphia, using the nearby Moylan - Rose Valley Station.Eleanore Price Mather, History (Vol. I), Ch. II-III, pp. 9-44 The buildings designed or renovated by Price during this period may be Rose Valley's major achievement. According to George E. Thomas, \\"Rose Valley is of exceptional importance, a major American architectural landmark.\\" After 1910 Schoen, McLanahan, and Price bought the remaining land from the Rose Valley Association, and Price designed the \\"Rose Valley Improvement Company Houses\\" near the old bobbin mill. As a group, these are the most important group of houses designed, rather than renovated, by Price in Rose Valley.Elizabeth Sippel, 1995 In 1926 a Pennsylvania State historic marker was installed on Rose Valley Road to the south of Thunderbird Lodge. It commemorates the Great Minquas Path, a Native American trail that ran nearby. It features a sculpture of a beaver by Albert Laessle.

The population was 784 at the 2010 census, down from 860 at the 2000 census.  History  Rutledge was founded in 1885 by a group of Philadelphia businessmen, and incorporated as a borough in 1887. A promotional brochure produced in 1897 described the community as follows: \\"Located ten miles from Philadelphia, on the line of the Central Division of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, three minutes walk from Morton Station ‚Äì it is reached in from 20 to 30 minutes by 21 trains daily‚Ä¶ To the west lies the magnificent Swarthmore College, and to the southeast, three miles away, lies the Delaware River‚Ä¶ its school is one of the finest in the county; its houses are neat and attractive, and their owners take great pride in their homes and the adornment of their grounds.\\" House in Rutledge Since then, there have been a few name changes. The train line is SEPTA's Media/Elwyn Line, which provides 26 trains on weekdays from Philadelphia to what is now called the Morton- Rutledge Station. But in many ways, this description still holds true today. The schools in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District are still among the finest in the county, and the homes, many of them dating back to the late 19th century, are still kept with pride by their owners. Keystone Marker perpetuating the myth that has the borough being named after Ann Rutledge. There is a long-standing legend that the borough was named after Ann Rutledge, a sweetheart of Abraham Lincoln. This erroneous story is perpetuated in the Keystone Marker that greets those approaching Rutledge from the south on Morton Avenue. The actual story, according to the founders' brochure, is that the town was named after a then-popular romantic novel written in the 1860s. However, the site of what is now Rutledge borough was once a section of land on the estate of Edward Rutledge, who served as Representative from South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention of July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia and was the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1958, George Raymond, the president of the NAACP Chester branch, purchased a house in Rutledge. The day before he was to move in, a fire burned down the house. After the fire, the township attempted to exercise eminent domain and claim Raymond's property as a site for a new town hall. Raymond threatened legal action and the township backed down. The house was rebuilt and Raymond took residence in the house in 1959. Geography Rutledge is located in eastern Delaware County at (39.900812, -75.327404).

It was one of three Catholic schools in Delaware County to close at that time. History First settled by Quakers who arrived in Pennsylvania with William Penn, Springfield was first recognized as a governmental entity in 1686. Many of the streets in Springfield are named after former prominent citizens, including Powell, Kennerly, Lownes, Levis, Thomas, Beatty, Lewis, Foulke, Evans, Powell, Pancoast, Worrell, and Edge. Originally, Springfield was primarily a farming town. On December 9, 1687, the settlers began laying the road to Amosland as it was then called. This road is now known as Springfield Road. In 1701 construction began on the Baltimore Pike; the road was formed of sturdy oak planks, some of which still exist under the current Baltimore Pike. 1701 also marked the year that construction began on the first Quaker meeting house. The meeting house burned in 1737 and was rebuilt. The current meeting house that stands in its spot was constructed in 1851. By the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 it is estimated from tax records that about 300 people resided in Springfield. By the 19th century Springfield had become more industrialized. Taking advantage of its many creeks for power, the inhabitants erected many mills. Well-known mill owners included William Fell, Samuel Pancoast, William Beatty, Samuel Levis, and Moses and Emanuel Hey. At the beginning of the 20th century Springfield's Baltimore Pike had become one of the busiest commercial areas outside of Philadelphia. The long, straight stretch of Baltimore Pike in the township was referred to as \\"The Golden Mile\\", commonly known for its many automobile dealerships. Baltimore Pike remains true to its history with many dealerships lining the side of the road. The Golden Mile is a unique corridor that is essentially a compact commercial strip that cuts directly through bedroom communities on both sides. Residents are currently attempting to undo the emblematic effects of urban sprawl along the mile through the implementation of green initiatives, responsible traffic planning, and zoning improvements. In the past century, all of Springfield's farmland was slowly bought up by developers who turned Springfield into the town it is today, that is, largely comprising developments of standard suburban single-family homes. One of the largest single developments was the Stoney Creek development. Construction began in 1949 and was completed in only five years. The huge development stretched from West Avenue to Providence Road and ran all the way up to Baltimore Pike. Over 75 homes were constructed in the development. Similar to most housing developments of their time, no two houses in Stoney Creek were built exactly the same. While all resemble each other with their stone fronts and common size, additional luxuries such as porches and window placement were available for purchase to make each one slightly unique. Though all of the farmland of Springfield's past is gone, many of the woods and fields of the past still remain standing today in some of the many parks located throughout the community. The bulk of Springfield's history lies recorded in the archives of the Heritage Society of Springfield, and the Springfield Township Public Library (a member of the Delaware County Library System). Springfield has three sister cities, Lisbon, Portugal, Lima, Peru, and Vancouver, Canada. Economy The township is home to Springfield Mall, a , two-level shopping mall. One of the first of several suburban locations of Strawbridge & Clothier was located in Springfield. The old Strawbridge & Clothier has since been reconstructed into a Target. Religion Catholic churches in Springfield Township include Holy Cross Church, St. Francis of Assisi Church, and St. Kevin Church. In 2014 the archdiocese asked the churches to produce documents about their future viability as other Delaware County Catholic churches had closed permanently around that time period. In 2015 the archdiocese stated that, at the time, all three would continue to operate.

History Thornbury Township lies in the drainage area of the Delaware River, named in honor of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, governor of the colony of Virginia. The river and its bay were explored by Henry Hudson in 1609, and over the next several decades the region was variously claimed by the Swedes, the Dutch, and the English. Its original human inhabitants were the Lenni-Lenape tribe of American Indians. Once the Dutch were defeated, King Charles II of England made his grant to William Penn in order to found the colony which came to be named Pennsylvania. The land within the present boundaries of Thornbury Township was taken up by \\"first purchasers\\" from William Penn. The original grant documents were copper-plate prints on parchment; some still survive and show a price of 100 English pounds for . The Court of Equity in Chester recognized a separate Thornbury Township in 1687, and appointed township officers. At the time, the area was in Chester County, one of the original counties chartered by William Penn; Delaware County had not yet been formed. Thornbury was named after the English birthplace of the wife of George Pearce, who in 1685 had been granted title to in the township. The Battle of Brandywine, the only major battle of the American Revolution fought in Pennsylvania, was within sight and sound of the western part of the township; follow-up military operations took place in the township (see below). In 1769, the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized the division of Chester County and the creation of Delaware County. In plotting the boundary between the two, Thornbury Township was divided. Border landowners were asked if they wished to remain in Chester County or be in Delaware County. The line thus drawn was quite irregular, and as a result, the northern boundary of the Delaware County township (like the southern boundary of its Chester County counterpart) is distinctly jagged (see map). Thornbury Township was enlarged by annexing the northern portion of Aston Township in 1837; that township was dissolved. The boundaries of Thornbury have remained unchanged since. The township is the location of \\"Thornbury\\" house, home of Revolutionary War figure Persifor Frazer. After the Battle of Brandywine, his wife Mary stood down a British raiding party in a celebrated incident.POLLY FRAZER - An Unsung Heroine‚Äôs Story The house and barn survived the war, but are now in ruins.

Geography Upland is located in southern Delaware County at (39.856762, -75.379429). It is bordered to the west by Chester Township, to the north by the boroughs of Brookhaven and Parkside, and to the northeast, east, and south by the city of Chester. Chester Creek, a southeast-flowing tributary of the Delaware River, forms the southern boundary of the borough. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. History Image of Upland Township from 1862 The first European settlers in this area were from the Swedish colony of New Sweden. They arrived in the area in 1643 and built a permanent settlement at Tinicum Island. Although the name literally means \\"up land\\", it also reflects the Swedish province of Uppland. The settlement of Upland was built around the point where Chester Creek flows into the Delaware River, which is part of the city of Chester (formerly also called \\"Upland\\"). The colonists had plantations devoted to the cultivation of tobacco for export to Sweden. Upland was reflected on the early map of New Sweden made by Peter Lindstrom in 1654. Narrative and Critical History of America (vol. 4) (Justin Winsor. Boston, MA: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1884)History of Upland Borough During this period, three governments were competing for colonial supremacy in the mid-Atlantic coastal area: the Dutch, the Swedish and the English. The Swedish settlement was incorporated into Dutch New Netherland on September 15, 1655. In 1664, the English captured New Netherland from the Dutch. In 1676, the Duke of York's laws were promulgated as the rule of conduct on the Delaware River, and courts were established, one of which was the Upland.Court in Chester County By the mid-1800s, the Upland Mills were built along Chester Creek in Upland by the wealthy textile manufacturer John Price Crozer. The mills produced clothing for the US Army and other customers. The borough of Upland, as opposed to the historic town of Upland (which was later renamed Chester), was founded May 24, 1869.

The population was 16,738 at the 2010 census. History The Lenni Lenape Indians were the earliest occupants of Upper Chichester. They erected several semi-permanent villages in the area tied to fishing and hunting cycles with some farming. The Upper Chichester area was claimed by New Sweden in 1643 and the Dutch in 1654, but both nations were primary interested in trading with the Lenni Lenape Indians. The first European settlers to Upper Chichester were in 1681 under the Penn's Grant of land to William Penn from King Charles II. The first purchasers under Penn's authority were fourteen English and Welshmen, mostly Quakers. Upper Chichester Township was originally part of the section of Chester County called Chichester. Chichester comprised the area now known as Upper and Lower Chichester. It is named after the town Chichester in West Sussex, England from which many of its settlers came from. Upper Chichester Township, at the time called \\"Chichester Liberty,\\" is considered by most to be one of the first settlements within the land grant of Pennsylvania. Among the earliest settlers of the township was Walter Martin, the founder of St. Martin's Church, in the late 17th century. The road from Chichester to Aston traversing the township almost due north, was laid out 1688, while the Upper Chichester road was laid out on Oct. 25, 1687. At the southwestern limit of the territory was a tract of , which was located September 5 and 6, 1681. The \\"Twelve-Mile Circle\\" (the circular northern boundary line of the state of Delaware) traverses this tract. The division of Chichester into Upper and Lower Chichester was made early in 1700 to facilitate public business. In 1753, an effort was made to have the division officially recognized. The movement was, however, met by sturdy opposition from the leading citizens and land-owners of Lower Chichester, stating that the township as it currently stood was convenient enough and did not need any separation. They further argued that recent work to mend the highways in Lower Chichester, and the need to provide for several poor in the township were more important uses of funds than the cost of the survey. The matter was permitted to drag along for six years, during which time the reasons for the official recognition of the separation of the two townships became apparent to all. In August 1759, a petition to formally separate the two townships was presented, bearing the signatures of almost every freeholder in Upper and Lower Chichester as well as those in Nether Providence. Edwin Booth, a significant land owner within Upper Chichester Township, is the namesake for the town of Boothwyn within Upper Chichester Township Boundaries. Local Pennsylvania Amish market \\"Booth's Corner\\" also inherit's his name and rests on the upper left corner of Booth's former land holdings. Upper Chichester became a first class township on December 30, 1941. The Chichester Friends Meetinghouse is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. Geography Upper Chichester Township is in southwestern Delaware County, west of the city of Chester. It is bordered to the south by the state of Delaware, to the west by Bethel Township, to the north by Aston Township, to the east by Chester Township and the city of Chester, and to the south by the borough of Trainer and Lower Chichester Township. The unincorporated community of Boothwyn is in the center and southern part of the township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.15%, is water. Waterways in Upper Chichester include Naaman's Creek and Marcus Hook Creek. Educational system Upper Chichester is a part of Chichester School District. Children within the township usually attend Boothwyn Elementary School (Grades K-4) or Hilltop Elementary School (Grades K-4), Chichester Middle School (Grades 5-8), or Chichester High School (Grades 9-12).

Upper Darby's population is diverse, representing over 100 ethnic cultures. The township hosts a range of housing types including densely populated rowhouse sections similar to houses in neighboring West Philadelphia, tree-lined neighborhoods of turn-of-the-century single-family houses and mid-century developments. It is Pennsylvania's sixth most populous municipality. Upper Darby is 65% residential, 25% commercial, and 8% other. As of the 2010 census, the township had a total population of 82,795. Because of a home-rule charter adopted in 1974 and effective in 1976, Upper Darby utilizes a mayor-council form of management, unlike communities that are still under the Pennsylvania Township Code. (\\"First Class\\" townships in Pennsylvania have a board of commissioners and are divided into wards, and \\"Second Class\\" townships have a board of supervisors, which are usually elected \\"at-large\\".) Upper Darby, along with Lower Merion, Haverford, and Cheltenham form the major inner ring western suburbs of Philadelphia. History=Earliest settlement In 1650, the area that eventually became Upper Darby had been inhabited by the Lenape tribe of Native Americans for hundreds of years, but war with the Susquehannock to the west, along with devastating smallpox and measles epidemics, had significantly reduced their numbers. The Lenape were part of the larger late Woodland culture, living in longhouses and birch bark homes, and engaging in the type of agriculture featuring Companion planting of the Three Sisters (winter squash, maize, and beans). The first permanent Europeans settlers arrived in late 1653 with a group from New Sweden. Soon after, in 1655, New Sweden was taken over by the Dutch, and then came under English rule in October 1664 as part England's overall conquest of New Amsterdam. The region was controlled as a possession of the English king until it was included in a large land grant to William Penn in 1681. Upon Penn's founding of the colony of Pennsylvania the next year, the area was designated as part of the municipality of Darby Township, in Chester County. It was subsequently part of the eastern section of that county which was split off on September 26, 1789, to form Delaware County. The Lower Swedish Cabin, thought to have been built in 1654, is located on Creek Road along the Darby Creek and is believed by many to be a remnant of the early Swedes, who introduced the log cabin to this area. Today the \\"Swedish Cabin\\" is designated with a Pennsylvania Historical Marker. The Cabin is also on the National Register of Historic Places. Division of Upper and Lower Darby Darby Township originally occupied the area between the current border of Upper Darby to the north, Cobbs Creek and then Darby Creek to the east and south, and Ridley and Springfield townships to the west. This continued until 1736, when, for the convenience of the inhabitants, it was decided at a town meeting to separate the upper part from the lower \\"in all matters save the levies made for the support of the poor,\\" with the northern part thereafter to be called Upper Darby Township. The exact boundary was not established until 1787, when a petition was presented to the court. The following is an excerpt from this petition: 19th and 20th centuries Collen Brook Farm Reflecting the Quaker background of its earliest English settlers, Upper Darby was active in the antislavery movement. At least one abolition society existed prior to 1830, and sent a committee of twelve prominent citizens to the 1830 meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia.A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Ed. John W. Jordan. NY: Lewis Historical Publishing, 1914. quoted in A History of Upper Darby; History.rays-place.com Many homes in the area were stops on the Underground Railroad, including Hoodland, the home of abolitionist Thomas Pennock, which was eventually bequeathed to the township's public library and which currently houses the children's library, connected to a much larger modern annex which houses the Main Branch. Another prominent abolitionist, Thomas Garrett, grew up in the township and Thornfield, his home until the age of 32, still stands at Garrett Road and Maple Avenue in the Drexel Hill section of the township. Two regiments from Upper Darby took part in the fighting in the American Civil War, and one, the 106th, was involved in the Battle of Antietam. The Abe Pennock House was a stop on the Underground Railroad The abundance of creeks and streams in the area favored the development of mills, and it was in Upper Darby that the first mills in Delaware County could be found. The mill trade greatly increased the population of the township, from just over 800 in 1800 to almost 5,000 by 1890. However, beginning in 1885, the township also lost large sections of territory as the citizens of more populated neighborhoods petitioned the state to be recognized as separate municipalities. The first of these was the borough of Clifton Heights (incorporated on June 1, 1885), followed by the boroughs of Lansdowne (July 6, 1893), Aldan (September 22, 1893), Millbourne (October 12, 1909), and East Lansdowne (June 3, 1911). (Part of the territory of Aldan was also taken from Darby Township.) In 1907, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company recognized the potential for growth in the township and extended the Market-Frankford elevated train line (or \\"El\\") from just west of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia to 69th and Market Streets in Upper Darby. The El terminus at 69th Street Station became a busy terminal serving several trolley and light rail lines into the suburbs, as well as numerous city and suburban bus routes. Commuter traffic spurred the development of the 69th St. shopping district in the 1920s by John McClatchy, and made Upper Darby the second busiest shopping area in the region, second only to Center City Philadelphia. The business district is noted for many fine examples of Art Deco style buildings. A population explosion in the township followed, and by the 1960s Upper Darby ranked as the 7th most populous municipality in Pennsylvania. In the early 1970s, students from Highland Park Elementary School began a campaign to have the Pennsylvania Firefly declared the official state insect of Pennsylvania. With advice and support from state legislators, the students began a campaign that included letter writing, the circulation of petitions, and the distribution of bumper stickers. On April 10, 1974, Governor Milton J. Shapp signed their bill making the Pennsylvania Firefly their state's official insect. A couple of years later, Highland Park Elementary School was presented with a bronze plaque in honor of the students' achievement. In 1991, five Upper Darby policemen were convicted in federal court and sentenced to prison for violating the civil rights of two residents, a father and son. Each was found guilty on several counts involving assault, false arrest, and prosecution. Arts and culture Upper Darby Township building The Tower Theater, located in Terminal Square at the intersection of 69th and Ludlow Streets, opened as a movie and vaudeville theater in 1927. After closing briefly, the Tower reopened as a concert venue in 1972, and has hosted acts including the first American tours of David Bowie and Genesis. In addition to musical acts, the Tower has hosted comedians such as Trevor Noah and Jim Norton. In 2018, Rolling Stone listed the Tower as one of the 10 best live music venues in the United States. Upper Darby Summer Stage is one of the nation's oldest youth theater programs. Opened in 2018, the Upper Darby Art Gallery in the Highland Park neighborhood features local, national and international artists and works, as well as art classes. Centered in Terminal Square and the West Chester Pike business districts, Upper Darby restaurants feature a diverse range of cuisines including Vietnamese, Thai, Liberian, Italian, Korean, Mexican, and Colombian. The community is also known for its Irish pubs, and the Llanerch Diner was the setting for a pivotal scene in the film Silver Linings Playbook. The Upper Darby International Festival is an annual event held in September on 69th Street. The festival features performances, artwork, and food reflecting the diverse cultural backgrounds of the Upper Darby community. The Philadelphia Museum of Art opened the first branch museum in the United States, modeled on the Carnegie Library branch system, on 69th Street. The 69th Street Branch of the PMA operated from 1930 to 1933.https://hiddencityphila.org/2020/01/have-art-will-travel-uncovering- the-69th-street-branch-of-pma/ The University of Pennsylvania operated the Flower and Clark Observatory in the Highland Park neighborhood from 1897 to 1956, the site is now known as Observatory Park.https://www.physics.upenn.edu/observer/fcoobs.html Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 7.9 square miles (20.4 km). The township lies on the edge of the Piedmont slightly above the City of Philadelphia ( above sea level). The area is crossed by several small creeks.

Paper mill The major industry in Johnsonburg is paper, with the largest mill owned by the Domtar Corporation. It was built more than a century ago, originally owned principally by the Armstrong family of Philadelphia (1888). By 1890 the Armstrong's had merged with the paper mills owned by Augustus Paine of New York to become the New York & Pennsylvania Company. The Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post purchased the mill in 1925. By 1950, it was believed to be the largest coated paper mill in the world. By the end of 1960s, Curtis Publishing filed for bankruptcy and closed the mill. Six months later, investors, including industrialist George S. Petty, formed a group called Penntech Papers, to purchase the mill assets, and continued it in operation for the next 20 years. In 1990, Penntech sold the mill to Willamette Industries, which was acquired by Weyerhaeuser in February 2002 in a hostile takeover and then in 2007 was acquired by Domtar.

The population was 13,070 at the 2010 census. Originally a small town inhabited by mostly Bavarian Roman Catholics, it was founded December 8, 1842. It is home to Straub Brewery and the first Benedictine convent in the United States. In 1992, the borough of St. Marys absorbed the surrounding township of Benzinger and incorporated as a city. Despite its place as the second-largest city by area in Pennsylvania behind Philadelphia, its low population leads to it being one of the state's sparsest cities. St. Marys lies in the center of Pennsylvania's elk country. It is one of the few places east of the Mississippi River that allows hunting of wild elk. The area is known for its access to outdoor activities, including trout streams and state hunting lands inside the city limits. History The town was founded as Marienstadt (Mary's City). Many historic structures are located within the boundaries of the St. Marys Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The Decker's Chapel and John E.

He is often regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte's ideas were also fundamental to the development of sociology; indeed, he invented the term and treated that discipline as the crowning achievement of the sciences. Influenced by the utopian socialist Henri de Saint-Simon, Comte developed positive philosophy in an attempt to remedy the social disorder caused by the French Revolution, which he believed indicated imminent transition to a new form of society. He sought to establish a new social doctrine based on science, which he labelled 'positivism'. He had a major impact on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and George Eliot.http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course His concept of sociologie and social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer, evolving into modern academic sociology presented by √âmile Durkheim as practical and objective social research. Comte's social theories culminated in his \\"Religion of Humanity\\", which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organisations in the 19th century. He may also have coined the word altruisme (altruism).  Life  Auguste Comte was born in Montpellier, H√©rault on 19 January 1798. After attending the Lyc√©e Joffre and then the University of Montpellier, Comte was admitted to √âcole Polytechnique in Paris. The √âcole Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of republicanism and progress. The √âcole closed in 1816 for reorganization, however, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the √âcole Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission. Following his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his Catholic and monarchist family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 Rue Bonaparte in Paris's 6th arrondissement (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to Henri de Saint-Simon, who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, L'Industrie, Le Politique, and L'Organisateur (Charles Dunoyer and Charles Comte's Le Censeur Europ√©en), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819's \\"La s√©paration g√©n√©rale entre les opinions et les d√©sirs\\" (\\"The general separation of opinions and desires\\"). In 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a Plan de travaux scientifiques n√©cessaires pour r√©organiser la soci√©t√© (1822) (Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.Pickering (2006), p. 192ff. Comte married Caroline Massin in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured ‚Äì only stabilized by French alienist Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol ‚Äì so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the Pont des Arts). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his Cours. Comte developed a close friendship with John Stuart Mill. From 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic Clotilde de Vaux, although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new \\"Religion of Humanity\\". John Kells Ingram, an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855. Tomb of Auguste Comte He published four volumes of Syst√®me de politique positive (1851‚Äì1854). His final work, the first volume of La Synth√®se Subjective (\\"The Subjective Synthesis\\"), was published in 1856. Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux. His apartment from 1841‚Äì1857 is now conserved as the Maison d'Auguste Comte and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le- Prince, in Paris' 6th arrondissement. Work=Comte's positivism Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positive Philosophy, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, A General View of Positivism (published in English in 1865). The first 3 volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \\"Queen science\\" of human society itself. His work View of Positivism would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method. Comte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'. Comte's stages were (1) the theological stage, (2) the metaphysical stage, and (3) the positive stage.Giddens, Positivism and Sociology, 1 (1) The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the Age of Enlightenment, in which man's place in society and society's restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in a supernatural power. Fetishism played a significant role during this time. (2) By the \\"Metaphysical\\" stage, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of Aristotle or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the French Revolution of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of universal rights as being on a vauntedly higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion. (3) In the Scientific stage, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of Napoleon, people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of human rights or prophecy of the will of God. Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard he was similar to Karl Marx and Jeremy Bentham. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of classical physics and academic history. Comte's law of three stages was one of the first theories of social evolutionism. Comte's Theory of Science ‚Äì According to him whole of sciences consists of theoretical and applied knowledge. Theoretical knowledge divide on general fields as physics or biology, which are an object of his research and detailed such as botany, zoology or mineralogy. Main fields mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and sociology it is possible to order according to decrescent range of research and complicatedness of theoretical tools what is connected with growing complexity of investigated phenomenones. Following sciences are based on previous, for example to methodically coll chemistry, we must imply acquaintance of physics, because all chemical phenomena are more complicated than physical phenomena, are also from them dependent and themselves do not have on them an influence. Similarly sciences classified as earlier, are older and more advanced from these which are presented as later. The other universal law he called the \\"encyclopedic law\\". By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics (astronomy, earth science and chemistry) and organic physics (biology and, for the first time, physique sociale, later renamed sociologie). Independently from Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s's introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented \\"sociologie\\", and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term \\"social physics\\", but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by Adolphe Quetelet. This idea of a special science (not the humanities, not metaphysics) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term \\"sociology\\" (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s (1748‚Äì1836).Des Manuscrits de Siey√®s. 1773‚Äì1799, Volumes I and II, published by Christine Faur√©, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Fran√ßoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Jacques Guilhaumou, Siey√®s et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot √† la chose, in Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines, Number 15, November 2006. Naissances de la science sociale. The ambitious (or many would say 'grandiose') way that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered \\"Anthropology, or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science.\\"1874 translation of System of Positive Polity, Vol. II, pages 356‚Äì347, cited in Urbanowicz, Charles F. 1992. \\"Four-Field Commentary\\". Anthropology Newsletter. Volume 33, Number 9, page 3. The motto Ordem e Progresso (\\"Order and Progress\\") in the flag of Brazil is inspired by Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progr√®s pour but (\\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; Progress as the goal\\"). Several of those involved in the military coup d'√©tat that deposed the Empire of Brazil and proclaimed Brazil to be a republic were followers of the ideas of Comte. Comte's explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of Harriet Martineau's translation of The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, we see his observation that, \\"If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part we could not even perceive them.\\"Comte, A. b (1974 reprint). The positive philosophy of Auguste Comte freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau. New York: AMS Press. (Original work published in 1855, New York: Calvin Blanchard, p. 27.b) Comte's emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern functionalism. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte's time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition. His emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA, the Shewhart cycle). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena. The early sociology of Herbert Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms. Comte's fame today owes in part to √âmile Littr√©, who founded The Positivist Review in 1867. Debates continue to rage, however, as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Henri de Saint-Simon. Auguste Comte did not create the idea of Sociology, the study of society, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture, but instead he expanded it greatly. Positivism, the principle of conducting sociology through empiricism and the scientific method, was the primary way that Comte studied sociology. He split sociology into two different areas of study. One, social statics, how society holds itself together, and two, social dynamics, the study of the causes of societal changes. He saw these areas as parts of the same system. Comte compared society and sociology to the human body and anatomy. ‚ÄúComte ascribed the functions of connection and boundaries to the social structures of language, religion, and division of labor.\\" Through language, everybody in a society, both past and present, can communicate with each other. Religion unites society under a common belief system and function in harmony under a system. Finally, the division of labor allows everyone in the society dependent upon each other. The religion of humanity Positivist temple in Porto Alegre In later years, Comte developed the 'religion of humanity' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the 'positivist calendar'. For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a \\"good Comte\\" (the author of the Course in Positive Philosophy) and a \\"bad Comte\\" (the author of the secular-religious system). The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte's English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to \\"vivre pour autrui\\" (\\"live for others\\"), from which comes the word \\"altruism\\".\\"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the Nouveau Grand-√ätre Supr√™me (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the Grand F√©tish (the Earth) and the Grand Milieu (Destiny)\\" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and \\"slightly dispiriting\\" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by \\"positive\\" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx. Law of three stages Comte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind.Delaney, Tim. \\"Auguste Comte\\". Council for Secular Humanism. Council for Secular Humanism, Oct.-Nov. 2003. The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system \\"has lost its power\\" and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. 10.Comte, Auguste, and Gertrud Lenzer. Auguste Comte and Positivism: The Essential Writings. New York: Harper & Row, 1975. Print. The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an \\"organic\\" new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment on society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a \\"series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters\\". The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage. The Law of Three Stages is split into stages, much like how the human mind changes from stage to stage. The three stages are the theological stage, the metaphysical stage, and the positive stage, also known as the Law of Three Stages. The theological stage happened before the 1300s, in which all societies lived a life that was completely theocentric. The metaphysical stage was when the society seeks universal rights and freedom. With the third and final stage, the positive stage, Comte takes a stand on the question, ‚Äúhow should the relations among philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be seen.\\"Bourdeau, Michel. ‚ÄúAuguste Comte.‚Äù Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, 8 May 2018, plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/. He says that sociology and history are not mutually exclusive, but that history is the method of sociology, thus he calls sociology the ‚Äúfinal science.‚Äù This positive stage was to solve social problems and forcing these social problems to be fixed without care for ‚Äúthe will of God‚Äù or ‚Äúhuman rights.‚Äù Comte finds that these stages can be seen across different societies across all of history. # Theological Stage ##The first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because \\"the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents\\".Bourdeau, Michel. Auguste Comte. Stanford University. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ [April 28, 2016]. The Theological Stage is the \\"necessary starting point of human intelligence\\", when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena.\\"Auguste Comte.\\" Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6Th Edition (2015): 1. MAS Ultra School Edition. Web. In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena was caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon's philosophy that \\"there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts\\", but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories. \\"For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other\\". Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been \\"incapable of remembering facts\\", and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life. Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary in the beginning of the developing primitive mind. The first theological state is the necessary starting point of human intelligence. The human mind primarily focuses its attention to the ‚Äúinner nature of beings and to the first and final causes of all phenomena it observes.‚Äù (Ferre 2) This means that the mind is looking for the cause and effect of an action that will govern the social world. Therefore, it ‚Äúrepresents these phenomena as being produced by a direct and continuous action of more or less numerous supernatural agents, who‚Äôs arbitrary interventions explain all the apparent anomalies of the universe.‚Äù (Ferre 2) This primary subset of the theological state is known as fetishism, where the phenomena must be caused and created by a theological supernatural being such as God, making humans view every event in the universe as a direct will from these supernatural agents. Some people believed in souls or spirits that possessed inanimate objects and practiced Animism. These natural spiritual beings who possessed souls and may exist apart from the material bodies were capable of interaction with humans, therefore requiring sacrifices and worship to please the agents. With all these new reasons behind phenomena, numerous fetishisms occur, needing several gods to continue to explain events. People begin to believe that every object or event has a unique god attached to it. This belief is called polytheism. The mind ‚Äúsubstituted the providential action of a single being for the varied play of numerous independent gods which have been imagined by the primitive mind.‚Äù These Gods often took on both human and animal resemblance. In Egypt, there were multiple gods with animal body parts such as Ra, who had the head of a hawk and had sun associations with the Egyptians. The polytheistic Greeks had several gods such as Poseidon who controlled the sea and Demeter who was the goddess of fertility. However, with all these new gods governing the phenomena of society, the brain can get a confused with the numerous gods it needs to remember. The human mind eliminates this problem by believing in a sub-stage called monotheism. Rather than having multiple gods, there is simply one all- knowing and omnipotent God who is the center of power controlling the world. This creates harmony with the universe because everything us under one ruler. This leaves no confusion of how to act or who is the superior ruler out of the several gods seen in polytheism. The theological state functions well as the first state of the mind when making a belief about an event because it creates a temporary placeholder for the cause of the action which can later be replaced. By allowing the brain to think of the reason behind phenomena, the polytheistic gods are fillers that can be replaced by monotheistic gods. The theological stage shows how the primitive mind views supernatural phenomena and how it defines and sorts the causes. ‚ÄúThe earliest progress of the human mind could only have been produced by the theological method, the only method which can develop spontaneously. It alone has the important property of offering us a provisional theory,‚Ä¶ which immediately groups the first facts, with its help, by cultivating our capacity for observation, we were able to prepare the age of a wholly positive philosophy.‚Äù (Comte 149) ##Comte believed the theological stage was necessary because of the foundational belief that man‚Äôs earliest philosophy of explanation is the act of connecting phenomena around him to his own actions; that man may ‚Äúapply the study of external nature to his own‚Äù.This first stage is necessary to remove mankind from the ‚Äúvicious circle in which it was confined by the two necessities of observing first, in order to form conceptions, and of forming theories first, in order to observe‚Äù. Additionally, the theological stage is able to organize society by directing ‚Äúthe first social organization, as it first forms a system of common opinions, and by forming such a system\\". Though, according to Comte, it could not last, this stage was able to establish an intellectual unity that made an impressive political system. The theological state was also necessary for human progress on account that it creative a class in society dedicated to ‚Äúspeculative activity‚Äù. It is in this way that Comte sees the theological stage continue to exist into the Enlightenment. Comte momentarily admires the theological stage for its remarkable ability to enact this activity amidst a time when it was argued to be impractical. It is to this stage that the human mind owes ‚Äúthe first effectual separation between theory and practice, which could take place in no other manner‚Äù other than through the institution provided by the theological stage. The Theological Stage is the stage that was seen primarily among the civilizations in the distant past. Having been used before the 1300s, this is a very basic view of the world with little to no involvement in the world of science, and a world of illusions and delusions, as Freud would put it. In order to seek the nature of all beings, mankind puts their focus on sentiments, feelings, and emotions. This turned mankind towards theology and the creation of gods to answer all their questions. ## Fetishism ###The Theological Stage is broken into three sections, Fetishism, Polytheism, and Monotheism. Fetishism is the philosophy in which mankind puts the power of a god into an inanimate object. Every object could hold this power of a god, so it started to confuse those who believed in Fetishism and created multiple gods and formed Polytheism. ## Polytheism ###The basic meaning of polytheism is the belief in an order of multiple gods who rule over the universe. Within polytheism, each god is assigned a specific thing in which they are the god of. Examples of this would be the Greek god, Zeus, the god of the sky/lightning, or Ra, the sun god, in Egyptian mythology. A group of priests were often assigned to these gods to offer sacrifices and receive blessing from those gods, but once again, because of the innumerable number of gods, it got confusing, so civilization turned to Monotheism. ## Monotheism ###Monotheism is the belief in one, all powerful god who rules over every aspect of the universe. The removal of emotional and imaginational aspect of both Fetishism and Polytheism resulted in intellectual awakening. This removal allowed for the Enlightenment to occur as well as the expansion of the scientific world. With the Enlightenment came many famous philosophers who brought about a great change in the world. This is the reason why ‚ÄúMonotheism is the climax of the theological stage of thinking.\\"Priya, Rashmi. ‚ÄúLaw of Three Stages: The Corner Stone of Auguste Comte's.‚Äù Your Article Library, 1 Dec. 2014, www.yourarticlelibrary.com/sociology/law-of-three-stages-the- corner-stone-of-auguste-comtes/43729. # Metaphysical or Abstract Stage ::The second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an \\"abstract entity\\"; it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own. ::The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because \\"Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible\\", and their \\"conceptions are so radically opposed in character\\", human intelligence must have a gradual transition. Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity. The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage, when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through \\"over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question\\". The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage. :: ::In understanding Comte‚Äôs argument, it is important to note that Comte explains the theological and positive stages first and only then returns to explain the metaphysical stage. His rational in this decision is that ‚Äúany intermediate state can be judged only after a precise analysis of two extremes‚Äù. Only upon arrival to the rational positive state can the metaphysical state be analyzed, serving only a purpose of aiding in transition from the theological to positive state. Furthermore, this state ‚Äúreconciles, for a time, the radical opposition of the other two, adapting itself to the gradual decline of the one and the preparatory rise of the other‚Äù. Therefore, the transition between the two states is almost unperceivable. Unlike its predecessor and successor, the metaphysical state does not have strong intellectual foundation nor social power for a political organization. Rather is simply serves to guide man until the transition from imaginative theological state to rational positive state is complete. :3. Positive stage ::The last stage ‚Äì the positive stage ‚Äì is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior, and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world.Delaney, Tim. Auguste Comte. Council for Secular Humanism, 2003. This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was \\"the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge\\" because it organized all of human behavior. The final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena. Humans realize that laws exist, and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation. Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage. He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the \\"science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes\\", is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe. Astronomy is the most simple science, and is the first \\"to be subjected to positive theories\\". Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the \\"general laws of the inorganic world\\", and are harder to distinguish. Physiology completes the system of natural sciences, and is the most important of all sciences because it is the \\"only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves\\". This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace. It is through observation that humanity is able to gather knowledge. The only way within society to gather evidence and build upon what we do not already know to strengthen society is to observe and experience our situational surroundings. ‚ÄúIn the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of phenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them; likewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones,‚Äù The imperfection of humanity is not a result of the way we think, rather our perspective that guides the way we think. Comte expresses the idea that we have to open our eyes to different ideas and ways to evaluate our surroundings such as focusing outside of the simple facts and abstract ideas but instead dive into the supernatural. This does not make mean that what is around us is not critical to look out for as our observations are critical assets to our thinking. The things that are ‚Äúlost‚Äù or knowledge that is in the past is still relevant to recent knowledge. It is what is before our time that guides why things are the way they are today. We would always be relying on our own facts and would never hypothesize to reveal the supernatural if we do not observe. Observing strives to further our thinking processes. According to Comte, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe dead govern the living,‚Äô which is likely a reference to the cumulative nature of positivism and the fact that our current world is shaped by the actions and discoveries of those who came before us,‚Äù As this is true, the observations only relevant to humanity and not abstractly related to humanity are distinct and seen situationally. Situation leads to human observation as a reflection of the tension in society can be reviewed, overall helping to enhance knowledge development. Upon our observation skills, our thinking shifts. As thinkers and observers, we switch from trying to identify truth and turn toward the rationality and reason nature brings, giving us the ability to observe. This distinct switch takes on the transition from the abstract to the supernatural. ‚ÄúComte‚Äôs classification of the sciences was based upon the hypothesis that the sciences had developed from the understanding of simple and abstract principles to the understanding of complex and concrete phenomena.‚Äù Instead of taking what we believe to be true we turn it around to use the phenomena of science and the observation of natural law to justify what we believe to be true within society. The condensing and formulation of human knowledge is what Comte drives us toward to ultimately build the strongest society possible. If scientists do not take the chance to research why a certain animal species is going distinct and their facts researched by those in the past is no longer true of the present, how is the data supposed to grow? How are we to gain more knowledge? These facts of life are valuable, but it is beyond these facts that Comte gestures us to look to. Instead of the culmination of facts with little sufficiency, knowledge altogether takes on its role in the realm of science. In connection to science, Comte relates to science in two specific fields in order to rebuild the construction of human knowledge. As science is broad, Comte reveals this scientific classification for the sake of thinking and the future organization of society. ‚ÄúComte divided sociology into two main fields, or branches: social statistics, or the study of the forces that hold society together; and social dynamics, or the study of the causes of social change,‚Äù In doing this, society is reconstructed. By reconstructing human thinking and observation, societal operation alters. The attention drawn to science, hypothesis‚Äô, natural law, and supernatural ideas, allows sociology to be divided into these two categories. By combining the simple facts from the abstract to the supernatural and switching our thinking towards hypothetical observation, the sciences culminate in order to formulate sociology and this new societal division. ‚ÄúEvery social system‚Ä¶ aims definitively at directing all special forces towards a general result, for the exercise of a general and combined activity is the essence of the society,‚Äù Social phenomena Comte believed can be transferred into laws and that systemization could become the prime guide to sociology so that all can maintain knowledge to continue building a strong intellectual society. In order to continue building a strong intellectual society, Comte believed the building or reformation requires intricate steps to achieve success. First, the new society must be created after the old society is destroyed because, ‚Äúwithout‚Ä¶destruction no adequate conception could be formed of what must be done,\\". Essentially a new society cannot be formed if it is constantly hindered by the ghost of its past. On the same terms, there will be no room for progress if the new society continues to compare itself to the old society. If humanity does not destroy the old society, the old society will destroy humanity. Or on the other hand, if one destroys the old society, ‚Äúwithout ever replacing it, the people march onwards towards total anarchy,‚Äù. If the society is continuously chipped away without being replaced with new ideal societal structures, then society will fall deeper back into its old faults. The burdens will grow deep and entangle the platforms for the new society, thus prohibiting progress, and ultimately fulfilling the cursed seesaw of remodeling and destroying society. Hence, according to Comte, in order to design a successful new society, one must keep the balance of reconstruction and deconstruction. This balance allows for progress to continue without fault. Predictions Auguste Comte is well known for writing in his book The Positive Philosophy that people would never learn the chemical composition of the planets. This has been called a very poor prediction regarding human limits in science. In thirty years people were beginning to learn the composition of planets through spectroscopy.How do we know the composition of stars?

The city became famous in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for being the manufacturer of Climax locomotives. History Erie County was formed from parts of Allegheny County on March 12, 1800. On May 27, 1861, tracks owned by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad intersected with those of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad and was called the \\"Atlantic and Erie Junction\\".Bates, p. 809. Land at the junction was owned by Hiram Cory, who sold a portion to the Atlantic and Great Western in October 1861\\\\. The railroad built a ticket office at the junction and named it for Cory, but through a misspelling it became Corry. The combination of railroad growth and the discovery of oil in nearby Titusville contributed greatly to Corry's development. This boomtown was chartered as a borough in 1863 and designated as a city in 1866. Industry has played a big part in Corry's growth, and the Corry Area Historical Society maintains a museum where one of the Climax locomotives (the steam engine used in logging operations that brought fame to Corry) is on display.

It is part of the Erie Metropolitan Statistical Area. As home to Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, it is a small college town, as well as a resort community. The population was 6,438 at the 2010 census, down from 6,950 at the 2000 census. The town is located in the snowbelt region south of Lake Erie. History The Eriez, Iroquois, and Cornplanter Native tribes were the first known residents of the area that is now known as Edinboro. The tribes called the region Conneauttee, meaning \\"land of the living snowflake\\". A man by the name of William Culbertson moved to the area in 1801, building a gristmill near Conneauttee Lake. From 1801 to 1825, the roots of the town were formed when congregations of Presbyterian and Methodist churches begun moving to the area and building houses and churches, some that are still around today. The original resident, William Culbertson, built the first school around 1825. The first post office was built and formed around 1837 when it was included in the Erie and Crawford counties postal routes. The farms helped the area grow during this time, and the area was incorporated in 1840 with a population of 232 at about . A turnpike between Erie and Meadville was constructed in the 1840s, made of wooden planks, and completed in 1852. In 1857, an academy was started, which was renamed the State Normal School in 1861, which would eventually become Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. A trolley station was built by the railway company, including an electric railway in the 1900s which drew more traffic to the area. Fires in 1902, 1905, and 1909, destroyed most of the wood-framed, commercial buildings but were rebuilt with brick structures that are still standing today. Many more homes, condos and apartments were constructed from 1910 through the 1950s, as Edinboro promoted itself, mainly to the surrounding populations in Pittsburgh and Erie as a resort area by the lake, which boosted tourism through this time period. Meanwhile, the college gained enrollment and drew more residents to the town. The 1960s was a large growth period for the town, as around 400 building permits were issued for both housing and business. The present day post office was built in 1960, and evolved to first class status by 1966. The demand for water consumption had tripled throughout this period, and prompted a new sewage plant to be constructed in 1970. The borough's Home Rule Charter was adopted in 1974, with a new municipal building being constructed in 1975. In 1980, the census placed Edinboro first in population growth in Erie County, with a population increase of 30% from 1970 to 1980 to a total of 6,324. The businesses in the borough continued to grow, and in 1983, Edinboro State College received accreditation by the state and was renamed Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. Between the 1980s and 2000s, Edinboro University has grown to be northwestern Pennsylvania's largest university and is a key factor in drawing people to the area. Today, Edinboro is known as a college town in the winter and lake resort during the summer. The Academy Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Geography Edinboro is located in southern Erie County at (41.876558, -80.131661). It is surrounded by Washington Township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.95%, is water. The center of the borough is at the south end of Edinboro Lake and around its outlet, Conneauttee Creek, a south-flowing tributary of French Creek and part of the Allegheny River/Ohio River/Mississippi River watershed. U.S. Route 6N passes through the center of Edinboro, leading east to U.S. Routes 6 and 19 near Mill Village, and west to Interstate 79. Pennsylvania Route 99 crosses US 6N in the center of Edinboro, leading north to McKean and southeast to Cambridge Springs. The city of Erie is north via US 6N and I-79. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 6,950 people, 2,087 households, and 830 families residing in the borough. The population density was 3,000.6 people per square mile (1,156.6/km¬≤).

MacCready's company AeroVironment. On June 12, 1979, it completed a successful crossing of the English Channel to win the second ¬£100,000 (¬£ today) Kremer prize. Design and development The aircraft was designed and built by a team led by Paul B. MacCready, a noted American aeronautics engineer, designer, and world soaring champion. Gossamer Albatross was his second human-powered aircraft, the first being the Gossamer Condor, which had won the first Kremer prize on August 23, 1977, by completing a -long figure-eight course. The second Kremer challenge was then announced as a flight across the English Channel recalling Louis Bl√©riot's crossing of 1909. The aircraft is of \\"canard\\" configuration, using a large horizontal stabilizer forward of the wing in a manner similar to the Wright brothers' successful Wright Flyer aircraft and powered using pedals to drive a large, two-bladed propeller. The Gossamer Albatross was constructed using a carbon fiber frame, with the ribs of the wings made with expanded polystyrene; the entire structure was then wrapped in a thin, transparent plastic (mylar PET film). The empty mass of the structure was only , although the gross mass for the Channel flight was almost . To maintain the craft in the air, it was designed with very long, tapering wings (high aspect ratio), like those of a glider, allowing the flight to be undertaken with a minimum of power. In still air, the required power was on the order of , though even mild turbulence made this figure rise rapidly. The crossing The cabin of the Gossamer Albatross, Armstrong Flight Research Center, April 1979 Just before 6 am on June 12, 1979, amateur cyclist and pilot Bryan Allen, powered the Albatross to the rehearsed speed of 75 revolutions per minute and took off from a point near Folkestone, England. The Channel conditions and lack of wind were ideal for the crossing. However, problems soon began to affect the aircraft and pilot. Allen's radio failed for a while and he was only able to communicate with the accompanying boats by hand and head movements. In addition, Allen's water supply had been estimated for a two-hour flight, but headwinds delayed the crossing and his supply ran out. Without adequate water, Allen suffered from dehydration and leg cramps. With increasing headwinds, concern grew that the flight would have to be called off. With the coast of France still unseen, an accompanying boat maneuvered in front of the Albatross to hook it to safety. However, for the hooking procedure, Allen had gone a little higher and found less air turbulence, so he continued to pedal the aircraft and see if progress could be made. With a calming surface wind, Allen continued, and landed on a beach at Cape Gris-Nez in France. Allen completed the crossing in 2 hours and 49 minutes, achieving a top speed of and an average altitude of . Versions The Gossamer Albatross II at the Museum of Flight in Seattle MacCready's team built two Albatrosses; the back-up plane was jointly tested as part of the NASA Langley/Dryden flight research program in 1980 and was also flown inside the Houston Astrodome, the first ever controlled indoor flight by a human-powered aircraft. The Gossamer Albatross II is currently on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Alistair Cooke devoted some of his Letter From America broadcast of 15/17 Jun 1979 to Allen's achievement. Prizes For his work on the Gossamer Albatross, MacCready was later awarded the Collier Trophy.

The population was 53,515 at the 2010 census. It is the largest suburb of Erie, Pennsylvania, and the 14th-largest municipality in the state, larger than the cities of Altoona and Harrisburg. Millcreek Township is home to the entrance to Presque Isle State Park, Waldameer Park, the Millcreek Mall, and many other attractions. Also located in the township is Erie International Airport, the major airport serving the Erie metropolitan area. History Evidence exists of Native American presence in Millcreek Township as early as 3700 BC. The township's Sommerheim Park is the location of the Sommerheim Park Archaeological District, which has yielded archaeological artifacts from the Archaic and Woodland periods.Johnson, William C. \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Sommerheim Park Archaeological District\\". National Park Service, 1981-06-29, p. 2. One of the earliest townships in the Erie Triangle to be settled, Millcreek was one of the original 16 townships of Erie County. As families came they moved from the bayfront settlement of Erie and began to form small hamlets such as Federal Hill, Kearsarge, Marvintown, and Weigelville, all to become part of Mill Creek Township. As the Erie settlement grew, first into a borough, then a city, it annexed more and more sections of the township. After the east/west roads were laid out, taverns began to sprout about every mile or so. Along the Ridge Road (U.S. Route 20), which was laid west through Millcreek in 1805, one of the few that remain is the Nicholson Tavern. Built in 1836, mostly by Isabella Nicholson and her sons, it is still owned by the family and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Presque Isle Light and Sommerheim Park Archaeological District are also listed. A recurving sandspit peninsula, Presque Isle, connects to the mainland in western Millcreek. During the War of 1812, Oliver Hazard Perry commanded his fleet in battle and strategically used the peninsula's bay as a harbor to construct six out of nine of the ships in his fleet.

History Waterford is said to contain the only statue of George Washington wearing a British uniform, but in reality, he had been sent by the Governor of Virginia and is wearing the uniform of an officer in the Virginia Militia. In December 1753, at age 21, Washington was asked by Governor Dinwiddie to carry a British ultimatum to the French on the Ohio frontier. Washington delivered the message at Fort Le Boeuf in present- day Waterford. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French to abandon their development of the Ohio Country to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in North America.Grizzard, Frank E., Jr. George Washington: A Biographical Companion.

It is situated along the Monongahela River abutting two other counties, Westmoreland to the north and Washington across the river. As of the 2010 census Belle Vernon had a population of 1,093. \\"Bellevernon\\", as it was originally spelled, was laid out in 1813 by Noah Speers in northwestern Fayette County. French for \\"beautiful green\\", this was the name chosen by both Noah Speers for his little community on the Monongahela River and later by his son Louis, who founded a town with nearly the same name just up the hill (North Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania). Directly across the river lies the borough of Speers, anchoring the far side of the landmark I-70 bridge as the east bridge abutments lie in adjacent Rostraver Township. Geography Belle Vernon is located at (40.126936, -79.868285), nestled in the northwest corner of Fayette County, with abutting borders on Washington County, to the west across the river, and Westmoreland County to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 20.29%, is water. Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods Belle Vernon has three land borders with Washington Township to the southeast and the Westmoreland County neighborhoods of North Belle Vernon to the north and Rostraver Township to the northwest. Across the Monongahela River to the south in Washington County, Belle Vernon runs adjacent with the aforementioned borough of Speers as well as Dunlevy. History Noah Speers was the father of Louis M. Speers, born in a log cabin on the Speers homestead/Gibsonton farm in 1810. The younger Speers played a large role in the development of Belle Vernon. During his lifetime, the population grew to about 700, and there was a steam ferry connecting Belle Vernon with Allen Township across the river. The little hamlet boasted five dry goods stores, four groceries, two glasshouses with 87 employees, a boot and shoe, cabinet, chair, wagon, saddle/harness, blacksmith/tanning shops, and two sawmills. Louis Speers owned a sandbank outside of town which produced the best quality glass sand. He also owned a large coal works and a large boat yard with more than 50 employees. Louis resided on the northwest corner of Main and 2nd streets. Boat hulls were built at his boatyard (owned in partnership with a man named Morgan Gaskill), located on 3rd Street in the 1830s and 1840s. Several steamboats are noted to have come from the yard, including the Minstrel, which in 1842 fell off its building docks killing one and injuring 10. The St. Anthony bound for Galena, Illinois, and the Cassandra headed to Knoxville, Tennessee, came from the Belle Vernon yard. Two boats bound for customers in Pittsburgh were the Alert and the Avalanche (1847). In 1853, Mr. Speers built a sawmill with partner William Latta, a boat builder, below the mouth of Speers Run. It was destroyed by fire in 1877 and rebuilt by his son William F. Speers. William, who spent three months in Libby Prison during the Civil War, left the army after attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. William went bankrupt soon after completing the new mill and sold it to the Belle Vernon Saw and Planing Company in 1880. The small village of Speers across the river, laid out in 1860 by a kinsman, gets its name from the same family. North Belle Vernon, in Westmoreland County, was laid out in 1872 by Louis and was incorporated in 1876. Louis died two years later in 1878 and is buried at the Rehoboth Presbyterian Church Cemetery. Samuel Dougherty, a carpenter, is claimed to have built the first dwelling in North Belle Vernon on Broad Avenue near Spring Alley. He was justice of the peace, council member, school director, and judge of election, all at the same time. The first two industries were a foundry in 1873 on Broad Avenue above Spring Alley and a flour mill on Speer Street in 1874. Most of these early buildings surrounded the intersection of Short Street and Broad Avenue. Lots were not sold until 1900 and the area beyond Arch Street then began to build up.

The Trading Post soon became a tavern and Inn, and was soon receiving emigrants heading west as it was located above the cut bank overlooking first ford that could be reached to those descending from the Mountains Brownsville is located south of Pittsburgh along the east bank of the Monongahela River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Brownsville, located as a county border town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 10.47%, is water--most of which is the Fayette County half of the Monongahela River between the community and the flatter lands of opposite shore West Brownsville in Washington County. As a community, the town is the central population center for a number of outlying hamlets geographically tied to the town for the same reasons they were founded nearby‚ÄîWestern Pennsylvania has far more hills and steep slopes than flats or gentle sloping terrains suitable for settlement. This keeps Brownsville at the nexus of the transportation infrastructure which grew up during its history. While no longer a passenger depot, the town and cross-River West Brownsville share an important Railway bridge creating a balloon loop allowing the turning of complete coal trains. Newest is the limited access toll road PA Route 43, which connects the town to strategic points and southern Pittsburgh at Clairton. River hugging PA Route 88, connects to towns up and down the Mon Valley and the historic National Road (now US Route 40) reached East Saint Louis, Illinois and connected the town to the immigrants arriving in the port of Baltimore traveling west on the Cumberland Turnpike and the National Road. From its founding, well into the 19th century, as the first reachable population center west of the Alleghenies barrier range on the Mississippi watershed, the borough quickly grew into an industrial center, market town, transportation hub, outfitting center, and river boat-building powerhouse. It was a gateway destination for emigrants heading west to the Ohio Country when a trading post, and the new United States' Northwest Territory and their \\"legal successors\\" for travelers heading westwards on the various Emigrant Trails both to the Near West and later Far West from its founding until well into the 1850s. As outfitting center, the borough provided the markets for the small-scale industries in the surrounding counties‚Äîand also, quite a few in Maryland shipping goods over the pass by mule-train via the Cumberland Narrows toll-route. Brownsville became a major center for building steamboats through the 19th century, producing 3,000 boats by 1888. The borough developed in the late 19th century as a railroad yard and coking center, with other industries related to the rise of steel in the Pittsburgh area. It reached a peak of population of more than 8,000 in 1940. Postwar development occurred in suburbs, as was typical of the time. The restructuring of the railroad and steel industries caused a severe loss of jobs and population in Brownsville, beginning in the 1970s. The borough had a population of 2,331 as of the 2010 census. Infrastructure=Transportation Aerial photo of Brownsville, looking over the Monongahela River Brownsville is located on the banks of the Monongahela River, a major tributary of the Ohio River, one of North America's most important waterways. The Monongahela is fully navigable at Brownsville, and offers inexpensive barge transportation to Chicago, New Orleans, St. Marks in Florida, Minneapolis, Tulsa, Kansas City, Houston, and Brownsville, Texas, on the border with Mexico. The shipyards of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, provided Captain Richard King of Brownsville, Texas (founder of the King Ranch), with powerful new-built riverboats to navigate the fast currents of the Rio Grande in 1849. Brownsville is connected to the satellite community of West Brownsville (in Washington County) by the Brownsville Bridge completed in 1914, which spans the Monongahela River. In 1960, the Lane Bane Bridge was constructed just downstream, and path of U.S. Route 40 was moved to the new high-level structure and new four lane highway by-passing old Route 40 until the two merged in the small bedroom neighborhood known locally as Malden.Malden mailing addresses use RD#2 Brownsville as postal addresses, but the lands and school systems are administered as part of Washington, County. It lies nearly equidistant from Centerville, Brownsville, and California. In the heyday of Conestoga wagon migration travels and with the congestion of Brownsville's hilly terrain, the flat lands about Malden just two-to-three further on offered rare open spaces for west-bound travelers to camp and recuperate from the rigorous mountain descent. Before the highway construction of the late 1950s was completed in the early 60s, two additional branchlike housing concentrations existed, the lined either side of 'California Road' which intersected Old U.S. 40 in the heart of the small business district at landmarks, Paci's Restaurant and Cuppies Drive-In Theatre;Landmark , later renamed the Malden Drive-in under new management operated for about 60 years before 2007, and was a well-known landmark in four counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania. www.cinematreasures.org/theaters/10344 the former set in a 17th- century stone Inn. The fourth concentration of housing extended from beside and beyond Cuppies Drive-In for over a mile either side of U.S. 40, now once again, single lane secondary highway. The community has few stores and several housing developments sited along a hilly plateau above the river valleys. The California Area High School is in part sited within parts of Malden. History In pre-Columbian times, the right bank Monongahela held several mounds where iron rich red stone predominated, now believed to have been constructed by a branch of the Mound Builders cultures, but were believed by colonials to have been forts‚Äîleading to the area near the river crossing being called Redstone Old Fort in various colonial government records,See notes quoted in Redstone Old Fort. and later Fort Burd, when an arms cache was built there. By the time the region first became known to Dutch colonists and traders and the French in the 1640s, the lands were largely unoccupied, but under the management of one tribe or shared by several groups of Iroquoian peoples, likely the Erie people, or Wenro people and possibly shared with Seneca, the Shawnee people and the Susquehannocks. With all the rivers and streams tributary to the Monongahela, Youghiogheny, Allegheny Rivers, there is little known about the region's precise role in the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, but when French and Dutch and Swedish fur traders penetrated to the Greater Ohio Basin in the 1640s-1650s, the one thing that seemed clear to those observers was the lands later termed the Ohio Country seemed empty and unpopulated. When in the 17th century, the occasional Englishman, as provincial Virginian or Marylanders generated their observations the emptiness of the region was confirmed. Before the 1750s, the area was 'colonized' by weakened remnant tribes such as the Delaware, the few Erie and the Susquehannock survivors (climbing the gaps of the Allegheny) the Iroquois allowed to move there as tributary peoples. These migrations occurred over the 70‚Äì80 years preliminary to the French and Indian War in the 1750s, where today's historians usually report the lands were long held as 'hunting territories' of the powerful Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. During the Revolution, the Iroquois were divided whether to back the Colonies or the mother country, and mostly did neither, attempting to stay neutral. Nonetheless in 1778, agitated by British Officers lobbying for frontier attacks, mixed parties of Tories (Loyalists) and Iroquois committed atrocities in 1778, so Washington sent the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, which broke the power of the Iroquois‚Äîre-opened the Ohio Country to homesteader settlement. As a river crossing, the closest to the pass that reached the Monongahela, the town would see a lot of boots of settlers passing by. View of Market Street historic district Because colonial settlers believed that earthwork mounds were a prehistoric fortification, they called the settlement Redstone Old Fort; later in the 1760s‚Äì70s, it eventually became known as \\"Redstone Fort\\" or by the mid-1760s, \\"Fort Burd\\" named after the officer who commanded the British fort constructed in 1759. The fort was constructed during the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) on the bluff above the river near a prehistoric earthwork mound that was also the site of historic Native American burial grounds. In 1774, a force from the Colony of Virginia garrisoned and occupied the stockade during Lord Dunmore's War against the Mingo and Shawnee peoples. It commanded the important strategic river ford of Nemacolin's Trail, the western path to the summit; this was later improved and called \\"Burd's Road\\". It was an alternative route down to the Monongahela River valley from Braddock's Road, which George Washington helped to build. Washington came to own vast portions of the lands on the west bank of the Monongahela; the Pennsylvania legislature named Washington County, after him and territorially, the largest county of the state. Entrepreneur Thomas Brown acquired the western lands in what became Fayette County, Pennsylvania, around the end of the American Revolution. He realized the opening of the pass through the Cumberland Narrows,See Nemacolin's Path, the French and Indian War (causes) and the history of George Washington as lieutenant and major in the Colonial Virginia Militia. and war's end made the land at the western tip of Fayette County a natural springboard for settlers traveling to points west, such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio. Many travelers used the Ohio River and its tributary, the Monongahela. Eventually the settlement became known as \\"Brownsville\\" after him. In the 1780s, Jacob Bowman bought the land on which he built Nemacolin Castle; he had a trading post and provided services and supplies to emigrant settlers. Redstone Old Fort is mentioned in C. M. Ewing's The Causes of that so called Whiskey Insurrection of 1794 (1930) as the site of a July 27, 1791, meeting in \\"Opposition to the Whiskey Excise Tax,\\" during the Whiskey Rebellion. It was the first meeting of that illegal frontier insurrection.\\"Timeline\\", Whiskey Rebellion Brownsville was positioned at the western end of the primitive road network (Braddock's Road to Burd's Road via the Cumberland Narrows pass) that eventually became chartered as the Cumberland toll road and later, after the Federal Government appropriated funds for its first ever road project, became known as the National Pike and well after tolls were removed, became the present-day U.S. Route 40, one of the original federal highways. As an embarkation point for travelers to the west, Redstone/Brownsville, blessed by several nearby wide & deep water minor river tributaries could support building slips, soon became a center in the 19th century for the construction of riverine watercraft, initially keelboats and Flatboats, but later steamboats large and small. The entire region sprouted small industries utilizing local coal and Iron deposits feeding iron fittings and products to outfitting settlers about to embark on the river. After 1845, its boats were used even by those intending to later take the Santa Fe Trail or Oregon Trail, as floating on a poleboat by river to St. Louis or other ports on the Mississippi River was generally safer, easier and far faster than overland travel of the time. A large flatboat building industry developed at Brownsville exploiting the flats across the river in present-day West Brownsville to erect building slips. This was followed by its rapid entry into the building of steamboats: local craftsmen built the Enterprise in 1814, the first steamboat powerful enough to travel down the Mississippi River to New Orleans and back. Earlier boats did not have enough power to go upstream against the river's current. Brownsville developed as an early center of the steamboat-building industry in the 19th century. The Monongahela converges with the Ohio River at Pittsburgh and allowed for quick traveling to the western frontier.Marc N. Henshaw, The Steamboat Industry in Brownsville Pennsylvania: An Ethnohistoric Perspective on the Economic Change in the Monongahela River Valley, Ypsilanti, Michigan: Western Michigan University, 2004 From 1811 to 1888, boatyards produced more than 3,000 steamboats.Mary Pickels, \\"Oral history project focuses on Mon Valley's steamboat era\\" , Pittsburgh TRIBUNE-REVIEW, July 26, 2010, accessed February 8, 2012 Steamboats were gradually supplanted in the passenger carrying trade after the American Civil War as the construction of railroad networks surged, but concurrently grew important locally on the Ohio River and tributaries as tugs delivering barge loads of minerals to the burgeoning steel industries growing up along the watershed from the 1850s. Steamboat propulsion would not be replaced by diesel powered commercial tugs until the technology matured in the mid-20th century. Plaque commemorating the first cast iron bridge built in the United States The first all-cast iron arch bridge constructed in the United States was built in Brownsville to carry the National Pike (at the time a wagon road) across Dunlap's Creek. See Dunlap's Creek Bridge. The bridge is still in use in . After the 1853 completion of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to the Ohio, outfitting emigrant wagon trains in Brownsville declined in importance. Yet the rise of the steel industry in the Pittsburgh area led Brownsville to develop as a railroad yard and coking center, generally integrated into other towns within the valley, so Brownsville and West Brownsville were tied to regional operations and while no one yard had space enough to be large, each township along the river shared resources and functioned as an elongated yard system. With its new role as Railroad center and coking center together with the decline of outfitting, the town gradually lost its diverse mix of businesses, but nonetheless, generally prospered during the early 20th century through the 1960s. Brownsville tightened its belt during the Great Depression, but the local economy resumed growth with the increased demand for steel during and after World War II, when many infrastructure projects hatched the improved and rerouted U.S. Route 40 over the new high level bridge, clearing up a perennial traffic congestion problem. In 1940, 8,015 people lived in Brownsville. Its postwar growth led to the development of cross-county-line suburbs such as Malden, Lowhill, and Denbeau Heights (Denbow Heights), which were mainly bedroom communities within commuting distance. In the mid-1970s after the OPEC Oil Embargo of 1973‚Äì74 triggered a recession, with the restructuring of the steel industry and loss of industrial jobs, Brownsville suffered a severe decline, along with much of the Rust Belt. Generally, the region has declined in population and vitality ever since. By 2000, the population was 2,804, as younger people had moved away to areas with more jobs. In 2011, Brownsville has a handful of buildings that are condemned or boarded up. Abandoned buildings include the Union Station of the railroad, several banks, and other businesses. The sidewalks around the town are still intact and usable. Brownsville attracted major entertainers in the early postwar years, who also were performing in nearby Pittsburgh. According to Mike Evans in his book Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul (2007), the singer developed his hit \\"What'd I Say\\" as part of an after-show jam in Brownsville in December 1958.Mike Evans, Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul, London: Omnibus Press, 2007 Lester Ward was elected mayor in 2009. In 2019, Browsville served as the primary filming location for the coming-of-age comedy-drama web television series I Am Not Okay with This, which became available on Netflix in 2020. Geography Brownsville is located at (40.020026, -79.889536), situated on the east (convex) side of a broad sweeping westward bend in the northerly flowing Monongahela River on the northwestern edge of Fayette County. The river's action eroded the steep-sided sandstone hills, creating shelf-like benches and connecting sloped terrain that gave the borough lowland areas adjacent to or otherwise accessible to the river shores. Much of the borough's residential buildings are built above the elevation of the business district. The opposite river shore of Washington County is, uncharacteristically for the region, shaped even lower to the water surface and is generally flatter. A small hamlet called West Brownsville developed on the western shore, with a current population of 992. Historically the area was a natural river crossing, and it was the site of development of a ferry, boat building and a bridge to carry roads. When the nascent United States government appropriated funds for its first road building project, in 1811 Brownsville was chosen as an early intermediate target destination along the new National Road. Until a bridge was built across the river, Brownsville was the western terminus. Redstone Creek is a local tributary stream of the Monongahela River, entering just north of Brownsville. Its color came from the ferrous sandstone that lined its bed, as well as the sandstone heights near the Old Forts. The creek was wide enough for settlers to build, dock and outfit numerous flatboats, keelboats, and other river craft. Its builders made thousands of pole boats that moved the emigrants who settled the vast Northwest Territory. Later Brownsville industry built the first steamboats on the inland rivers, and many hundreds afterwards. Colonists used the term \\"Old Forts\\" for the mounds and earthworks created by the prehistoric Mound Builders cultures. Archeologists and anthropologists have since determined that many prehistoric Native American cultures in North America along the Mississippi River and its tributaries built massive earthworks for ceremonial, burial and religious purposes over a period of thousands of years prior to European encounter. For instance, the Mississippian culture, reaching a peak about 1150 CE at Cahokia in present-day Illinois, had sites throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, and into the Southeast. Archaeological research is ongoing working to tie the local mounds and others regionally close to a particular era and culture. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,804 people, 1,238 households, and 716 families residing in the borough. The population density was 2,796.6 people per square mile (1,082.6/km2).

Features Dunlap's Creek Bridge (1839) under part of the level stretch of Market Street, carrying old U.S. Route 40 over Dunlap's Creek in Brownsville, is the nation's oldest cast iron bridge in existence. (Capt. Richard Delafield, engineer; John Snowden and John Herbertson, foundrymen) The Flatiron Building (c. 1830), constructed as a business building in thriving 19th-century Brownsville, is one of the oldest, most intact iron commercial structures west of the Allegheny Mountains. Over its history, it has housed private commercial entities as well as public, such as a post office. It is the unofficial \\"prototype\\" for the flatiron buildings seen across the United States. The most notable is the Flatiron Building in Market Square in New York City. After nearly being demolished, the building was saved by the Brownsville Area Revitalization Corporation (BARC). Throughout two decades, via private and public grants, BARC has restored the Flatiron Building as an historic asset to Brownsville. The Flatiron Building Heritage Center, located within the building at 69 Market Street, holds artifacts from Brownsville's heyday, as well as displays about the community's important coal and coke heritage. The Frank L. Melega Art Museum, located with the Heritage Center, displays many examples of this local southwestern Pennsylvanian's famous artwork, depicting the coal and coke era in the surrounding tri-state region.\\"BARC Flatiron Building\\" , Flatiron Center In addition to the Dunlap's Creek Bridge, Brownsville is the location of other properties on the National Register of Historic Places. They are Bowman's Castle (Nemacolin Castle), Brownsville Bridge, St. Peter's Church, and Thomas H. Thompson House. There are two national historic districts: the Brownsville Commercial Historic District and Brownsville Northside Historic District.

Transportation Union Passenger Depot / P&LE; (1913) National Register of Historic Places Connellsville Amtrak Station (Capitol Limited line) Looking south at the Connellsville rail yard from West Crawford Avenue Railroads Connellsville has the distinction of having been served at one time by five railroads: the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Western Maryland Railroad, the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Norfolk and Western Railroad. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX Transportation) entered Connellsville on the right (east) side of the Youghiogheny River. This main line originated in Baltimore, passed through Cumberland, Maryland heading west followed the river to Pittsburgh, then continuing on to Chicago. In 1934, the B&O; switched its passenger trains to the tracks of the P&LE; and used the P&LE; station.Wikipedia site: Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad The Pennsylvania Railroad's Southwest branch from Greensburg entered Connellsville from Connellsville Township, crossing Route 119 and the North End, then crossing the Youghiogheny on a trestle in the middle of the town; this line terminated in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The line has been abandoned, and the trestle was demolished in the late 1980s. It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed. This line is now operated by the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad. The Western Maryland Railroad's line crossed the Alleghenies from Cumberland and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny River, connecting with two separate railroad companies. The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh. This was in direct competition with the B & O directly across the river. The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western Railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh & West Virginia railroad bridge. The Norfolk & Western branch was acquired by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, which built a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX, which severed the old line across the bridge. This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition. Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the right of way acquired for other uses. The former Western Maryland Railroad and Pittsburgh & Lake Erie lines are now the part of the Youghiogheny River Trail. Amtrak's provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington, DC, and other points in between. West Penn Railway Historically, the mining and steel working Connellsville- Greensburg-Scottdale-Jeannette-Mt Pleasant-Irwin-Latrobe area was served by a 339-mile interurban trolley system, the wide track gauge West Penn Railways. It operated until 1952. Before the better economy of the area plus improved roads allowed more ownership and use of automobiles, the run every hour 5 cents a ride bright orange West Penn trolleys provided reliable local transportation.Wikipedia site: West Penn Railway Transit center The Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation transit center hub is located at the Connellsville Airport in Lemont Furnace, about halfway between Fayette's two largest urban centers, Connellsville and Uniontown.

DePasquale also reported the Pennsylvania Department of Education failed to take any action to remediate the poorly performing schools to raise student academic achievement or to provide them with targeted professional assistance. ;Opportunity Scholarship - lowest achieving schools In May 2015, the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) released a report identifying five Connellsville Area School District schools as among the lowest achieving schools for reading and mathematics in the state, including Dunbar Township Elementary School. One hundred four (104) public school districts had one or more schools on the list. Parents and students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. ;AYP history Dunbar Township Elementary School remained in Corrective Action II AYP status. Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, the District was mandated to inform parents of the poor achievement and to offer the option to transfer to a more successful school in the District. In 2012, just 62% of pupils were reading on grade level in 3rd through 6th grades. Additionally, 69% of the pupils demonstrated on grade level mathematics skills. In 4th grade science, 89% were on grade level. In 2011, Dunbar Township Elementary School declined further to Corrective Action II AYP status, due to chronic, low student achievement in reading and mathematics. In 2010, Dunbar Township Elementary School declined again to School Improvement Level 2 AYP status, due to continuing low student academic achievement. The administration was required to inform parents of the School's low academic achievement in reading and math.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dunbar Township Elementary School AYP status 2010, October 20, 2010 In 2009, the School declined to School Improvement Level 1 AYP status. The administration was required, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to inform the community of the lagging achievement and to develop a plan to raise student academic achievement. The school was required to pay for after school tutoring for struggling students. Dunbar Township residents may also apply to attend any of the Commonwealth's 13 public, cyber charter schools (in 2013) at no additional cost to the parents. The resident‚Äôs public school district is required to pay the charter school and cyber charter school tuition for residents who attend these public schools. The tuition rate that Connellsville Area School District must pay was $9,558.54 in 2013. Intermediate Unit #1 provides a wide variety of services to children living in its region which includes Dunbar Township. Early screening, special education services, speech and hearing therapy, autistic support, preschool classes and many other services like driver education are available. Services for children during the preschool years are provided, without cost to their families, when the child is determined to meet eligibility requirements. Intermediate units receive taxpayer funding: through subsidies paid by member school districts; through direct charges to users for some services; through the successful application for state and federal competitive grants and through private grants.Intermediate Unit 1 Administration, About our services, 2014  References  Category:Pittsburgh metropolitan area Category:Townships in Fayette County, Pennsylvania Category:Townships in Pennsylvania ","title":"Dunbar Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"132524","text":"East Uniontown is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States.
