The compression-ignition diesel engines listed below were formerly used by various marques of automobiles and commercial vehicles of the German automotive concern, Volkswagen Group,ETKA official factory data and also in Volkswagen Marine and Volkswagen Industrial Motor applications, but are now discontinued. All listed engines operate on the four-stroke cycle, and unless stated otherwise, use a wet sump lubrication system, and are water-cooled. Since the Volkswagen Group is European, official internal combustion engine performance ratings are published using the International System of Units (commonly abbreviated \\"SI\\"), a modern form of the metric system of figures. Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original 80/1269/EEC, or the later 1999/99/EC standards. The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated power output is the kilowatt (kW); and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the 'Pferdest√§rke' (PS, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'metric horsepower'), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the horsepower (hp) or brake horsepower (bhp). (Conversions: one PS ‚âà 735.5 watts (W), ‚âà 0.98632 hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the Newton metre (Nm) will be the reference figure of torque. Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ascending order of preference: #Number of cylinders, #Engine displacement (in litres), #Engine configuration, and #Rated power output (in kilowatts). The diesel engines which Volkswagen Group currently manufactured and installed in today's vehicles, and Marine and Industrial applications, can be found in the list of Volkswagen Group diesel engines article.

In 1996, it was retrospectively awarded the 1946 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. Publication history \\"Uncommon Sense\\" was first published in the September 1945 edition of Astounding Science Fiction and included in Clement's 1969 collection Small Changes. Subsequently, it was published in Nebula Awards Showcase 2000. The story was the first of Hal Clement's \\"Laird Cunningham\\" series, followed by \\"The Logical Life\\" in 1974, \\"Stuck With It\\" in 1976 and \\"Status Symbol\\" in 1987. In February 2000, all four stories were re- published in The Essential Hal Clement, Volume 2: Music of Many Spheres. Plot Laird Cunningham is a rich man who enjoys travelling to distant worlds in search of bizarre life forms. On the trip told in this story, Cunningham overhears the plotting of his two assistants to loot the ship. To avoid this, he forces a crash landing on an unnamed planet, sabotages the ship and escapes, leaving his assistants in the ship. Cunningham goes exploring and finds that the planet is very strange and orbits one of the fiercest suns in the galaxy (Deneb). The planet itself is quite similar to Earth's Moon, being airless and of a similar size, but due to the daily heating by its sun, the terrain is very different and appears strangely windswept. Cunningham also investigates the local life forms which include plants, herbivores, and carnivores. He dissects a few of the animals and finds that they have liquid metal for blood and that their eyes are more like noses, in that their eyes function as pinhole cameras with respect to the local gas molecules, which in the near vacuum travel in essentially straight lines like light rays. Cunningham realises that the animals navigate mostly by smell, since the extremely bright, undiffused sunlight would hamper an optical sense. Taking refuge in a cave, Cunningham watches his ship and his assistants as they attempt to repair it, welding up cracks in the ship's hull. However, they only work during the day and return to the inside of the ship at night. By night, Cunningham kills animals and collects their blood in grooves in the cave floor. The blood freezes in the cold of the night and he attaches the resulting small bars of metal to the remaining cracks in his ship's hull. The next morning, his assistants emerge to continue welding, which melts the bars of blood. The smell attracts many local predators, and Cunningham makes his way onto the ship in the commotion. Although the assistants easily fight off the alien animals, Cunningham locks them in the airlock as they attempt to return to the ship. He then sends out a distress call and sits back, as rescue will arrive in several hours. Reception The SF Site described \\"Uncommon Sense\\" as a classic hard science fiction work, in which the story is predicated \\"on the protagonist's ability to solve a scientific puzzle in the context of the conditions of an alien world.\\" References External links * *\\"Uncommon Sense\\" at the Internet Archive Category:1945 short stories Category:Deneb in fiction Category:Hugo Award for Best Short Story winning works Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"Uncommon Sense"},{"id":"17402861","text":"In contrast to a usual chaplain (a priest serving a specific group of people), a bishop's chaplain or archbishop's chaplain is chaplain to a bishop only.

The station is owned by Edward Perry, Jr. through licensee Marshfield Broadcasting Co., Inc. and is currently simulcasting sister station WATD-FM in Marshfield, Massachusetts. The station also broadcasts through FM translator station W266DA (101.1). History =As WBET= WBMS signed on as WBET on November 27, 1946. The station was owned by The Brockton Publishing Company, with studios on 60 Main Street in Brockton, inside the headquarters of The Enterprise newspaper. The original frequency was 990 kc., daytime only, but by 1952 would move to its current 1460 kc. frequency due to the owners of WBET buying the two other Brockton stations, WBKA (1450 AM) and WBKA-FM (107.1). WBET then turned in the licenses for 990 and 107.1 and moved WBET to 1460. WBKA had been owned by Joseph Curran. The 1951 Broadcasting Yearbook does not list either WBKA or WBKA-FM but the 1953 Broadcasting Yearbook lists WBET as having a construction permit for 1460 with 1,000 watts and the following year is listed as being on 1460. 1948 saw the addition of FM simulcast service with WBET-FM (97.7). When WBET would sign off at sundown, WBET-FM provided service through the nighttime hours. In 1976, WBET-FM ended its simulcasts of the AM station and began broadcasting a top 40 format. A year later, its call letters were changed to WCAV. In 1982, the station switched to a country music format and remained with it until 1999 when Radio One purchased the station and moved its studios out of Brockton. Today, that station is operated from studios in Medford, Massachusetts by iHeartMedia as WKAF and broadcasts a rhythmic classic hits format. WBET featured local news, talk, sports and a variety of different programs and was promoted as \\"Full Service Radio for Metro South.\\" WXBR logo from 2006-2012, under the ownership of Business TalkRadio Network. =Sale to Business TalkRadio Network, as WBZB/WXBR= The station was purchased in 2006 by the Business Talk Radio Network based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Syndicated programming from the network was added to the station's lineup. The station was assigned the WBZB call letters on November 24, 2006, three days ahead of the 60th anniversary of its first sign-on. On December 12, 2006, the station changed its call sign to WXBR. The station was put up for sale in 2011. On May 2, 2012, WXBR staff was evicted from its studios for failure by its owner to pay rent. During this time, the station aired only those programs syndicated by the Business Talk Radio Network. WXBR logo from 2012-2014, under the ownership of Azure Media. =Sale to Azure Media= On May 18, 2012, the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of WXBR to Azure Media, LLC., a Haitian American-owned radio group based in Miami Gardens, Florida. The station's local programming returned to the air that day with its rent paid. On August 3, 2012, Azure Media officially took control of WXBR and signed the station off at 7 P.M. the same day. Former station personalities Dawn Carr and Dennis DeNapoli were on hand at its 60 Main Street studios to announce that the station would be off the air as its studios were relocated and thank all of its current personalities and staff at the time. This was followed by a vintage programming promo voiced by Jack Ainslie from its days as WBET and the playing of \\"Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby Goodbye)\\" by The Four Seasons. DeNapoli read the final station identification before the station went silent. Azure Media constructed new studios on 250 Belmont Street in Brockton with new studio equipment and replaced the station's transmitter. Also, a new logo and website was designed. The new owners intended to return most of WXBR's original programming and hosts under the previous ownership and invite local businesses and community members to start new programs on the station. The station was originally scheduled to return to the air on September 12, 2012. However, problems with the installation of the new transmitter delayed that return. It was later revealed that copper plates needed to transmit were allegedly stolen from its transmitter site in West Bridgewater among other unexpected issues. Those issues were successfully resolved and almost six months to the day after the station signed off, WXBR returned to the air on February 2, 2013 at 6:50 P.M. with a 30-minute test broadcast consisting of a mix of classic rock and country music played from its new studios. More stunting was periodically conducted in the days that followed. The station officially returned to the air on March 5, 2013. WXBR Radio Azure logo, used from 2014-2015 Azure attempted to restore WXBR's original format of local news, talk, sports and variety programming with a mix of longtime personalities, new faces and syndicated offerings. They also encouraged community members to purchase time on the station to develop new programs under a time-brokered format. However, according to reports, the station had been unsuccessful with these efforts and was losing revenue under this format. On July 7, 2014, Azure Media announced that it would be ending WXBR's in-house broadcasts and change the station's format to ethnic Haitian Creole. The station's last day of airing local news and talk programs was July 11, 2014. The station was branded as Radio Azure 1460, adopted the slogan La Radio Haitienne de Boston (Boston's Haitian Radio Station), and had its studios relocated to Randolph, Massachusetts. =Sale to Marshfield Broadcasting Company, as WATD/WBMS= On April 29, 2015, the Marshfield Broadcasting Company and owner Ed Perry entered into an agreement to purchase WXBR from Azure Media. The station was taken silent shortly thereafter and the sale was closed on July 17, 2015 at a purchase price of $165,000. The new owner planned to bring the station's studios back to Brockton, restore its original full service format and change its callsigns to WATD, in reference to the company's flagship station, WATD-FM in Marshfield. The station changed its call sign to WATD on April 28, 2016. In February 2019, WATD returned to the air with a simulcast of WATD-FM and signed on FM translator station W266DA. On March 1, the station changed its callsign to WBMS, which stands for \\"Brockton Metro South.\\" This would be the third time the WBMS call sign was used in the Boston market, as it was the call sign for WILD (1090 AM) from its sign-on in 1946 to 1951 and again from 1952 to 1957. The station has since aired limited original programming and sports with a locally based oldies format on weekdays while continuing to simulcast WATD-FM. Programming =Former hosts= One of the earliest personalities at WBET was Arthur \\"Doc\\" Jones. He was brought over from the former WBKA in 1952 and hosted the morning drive time slot (6-9AM) from that point through the mid-to- late 1970s. After Jones, William \\"Bill\\" Hess took over the time slot and hosted until 1983. He is currently the program director at WMAL-FM in Washington, D.C.. Charlie Bergeron hosted the morning show for 21 years (1983-2004). He was also WBET's program director, general manager and play-by- play announcer for high school sports during his time at the station. In 2004, frequent fill-in host Steve Mason became the successor to Bergeron, who is currently a freelance broadcaster and weekend sports anchor at WBZ in Boston. In January 2009, WXBR made changes to its traditional morning drive format, which featured two people; Mason and news director Kevin Tocci. Management cited tough economic times and decided go with a single personality. Tocci was asked to continue with live news updates, and also to fill the role of host. Mason was let go after 16 years at the station and is currently a personality on WPLM-FM in Plymouth. The show was renamed The Metro South Morning News with Kevin Tocci. Tocci also hosted a sports talk show on the station with Mark Littlefield on Saturday afternoons called KITB Sports Talk (KITB standing for \\"Krashing into the Bigfield\\"). After Azure Media took over ownership of the station and took it off the air in August 2012, Tocci departed and joined WATD-FM as a news correspondent and talk show host. When the station returned to the air in March 2013, Peter Czymbor and Mike Paiva took over as hosts and the show was known as the Metro South Morning Show or PM in the AM until the switch to ethnic Haitian in July 2014. Jim Larkin was one of the longest- tenured personalities at WBET/WXBR. He hosted Sounds of the Emerald Isle, an Irish music and comedy show, Sunday afternoons from 1982-2012. When Azure Media took over ownership of the station and took it off the air in August 2012, Larkin moved his show to WVBF in Middleborough Center. Bill Alex hosted Newsline, a popular Brockton-area morning talk show/news program weekdays from 9-11AM during the 1990s. Bill also reported news events during the day at WBET. The following is a Bill Alex newsclip. (credit to former WBET/WXBR hosts Jim Larkin and Dale Morris). Ron Van Dam, who was brought over from cross-town WMSX, became the successor to Alex's program in 2001 and hosted until the change in formats in July 2014.

The Seljuq army had been raiding Byzantine territory in the Maeander Valley in Anatolia, and had sacked a number of cities. The Byzantine force ambushed the Turks at a river crossing. Background Following Emperor Manuel Komnenos's defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon (1176) the Byzantines failed to implement all the conditions, particularly the destruction of border fortresses, demanded by the Seljuq sultan Kilij Arslan II as a prerequisite for a cessation of hostilities.; . Soublaion was razed but not Dorylaion. A substantial Seljuq cavalry army, including Turcoman nomad auxiliaries, was dispatched into Byzantine territory, in the Meander Valley in western Anatolia, on a retaliatory raid. A Byzantine army under the general John Komnenos Vatatzes, the emperor's nephew, set out from Constantinople with instructions to intercept the Seljuq raiders.John Komnenos Vatatzes was the son of Theodore Vatatzes and the princess Eudokia Komnene, a sister of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Vatatzes was given two other generals as his subordinates, Constantine Doukas and Michael Aspietes, and was able to pick up reinforcements as his army moved through Byzantine territory.; . Battle Byzantine cavalry from the Skylitzes manuscript. The date of the battle is unknown, it has generally been ascribed to the year 1177 on the basis of its position within the narrative of Niketas Choniates. The Turks, who had orders to ravage the Meander Valley as far as the sea-shore, sacked the Byzantine settlements of Tralles, Antioch, Louma and Pantacheir. As a result of these successes, they were loaded with plunder, including, rather poetically, water from the sea, an oar and shore sand.. The stranger items of plunder were doubtless stipulated by the sultan in order to prove that his forces had reached as far as the sea. These burdens would have drastically slowed their progress and lessened their tactical mobility. The Seljuq army was returning towards Turkish territory when it approached a \\"choke point\\" in its journey where the great eastern highway crossed the Meander River by way of a bridge (probably ruined or semi-derelict), near the villages, or forts, of Hyelion and Leimocheir.. Ramsay argues that Hyelion and Leimocheir must have been in the general vicinity of Antioch-on-the-Meander, one of the settlements sacked by the raiding Seljuqs. Even a ruined bridge would mark a shallow crossing point of the river. The Byzantines had concealed themselves and were divided into two corps, separated by the river. They caught the Seljuq army in an ambush when it had partially crossed over the river, destroying it as a fighting force.; . The Byzantine light troops played a prominent role in the battle; posted on high ground they are described as raining missiles down onto the near helpless Seljuqs. Many of the Seljuq soldiers tumbled into the river and were drowned.. The Seljuq commander, known as \\"Atapakos\\" in Greek sources‚Äîevidently a bearer of the title of Atabeg‚Äîtried to help his forces cross the river by rallying the most heavily armed of his cavalry and attacking the Byzantines. This attack having failed, he tried to save himself by swimming across the river with his horse. When he reached the opposite shore, however, he was killed by an Alan soldier of the Byzantine force.. Following the death of their commander the Seljuq troops fled in disorder, with a great number of them being drowned in the river; Choniates stating that only a few out of many thousands were able to save themselves. On the Byzantine side, the general Michael Aspietes fell; he was drowned in the Meander when thrown by his wounded horse.. Aftermath A map of the Byzantine Empire showing the location of the Meander River. The battle was a significant Byzantine victory and it underlined how limited the immediate effects of the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon were on the empire's hold over its Anatolian possessions. The Byzantine victory was followed up by punitive expeditions against the Turcoman nomads settled around the upper Meander Valley. . The Byzantine strategy at this battle, ambushing a raiding army on its return journey when it would be slowed by plunder and captives, is exactly what is prescribed in much earlier Byzantine military treatises, such as the Tactica of Leo VI (886‚Äì912). This points to a retention by Byzantine commanders of knowledge of the successful military strategies of the past.Haldon, pp. 89-90 The emperor Manuel died in 1180; his son and successor Alexios II Komnenos was a minor, and the empire was governed by a divided regency. Without the strong presence of Manuel, the military advantage in Anatolia reverted to the Seljuqs. Sultan Kilij Arslan invaded the empire in 1182, when Byzantium was distracted by the coup d'√©tat of Alexios's cousin Andronikos Komnenos, and following the Siege of Cotyaeum captured the towns of Sozopolis and Cotyaeum.Kafesoƒülu, p. 71 See also *Komnenian army References Sources =Primary= * =Secondary= *Angold, Michael, (1984) The Byzantine Empire 1025‚Äì1204, a political history, Longman.  *Kafesoƒülu, I.

It is a colorless liquid with an ammonia odor. It is miscible with water, ethanol and benzene. A tertiary amine, it is widely used as a sweetening agent in chemical, oil refinery, syngas production and natural gas.Matthias Frauenkron, Johann-Peter Melder, G√ºnther Ruider, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke \\"Ethanolamines and Propanolamines\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Similar compounds are monoethanolamine (MEA), a primary amine, and diethanolamine (DEA), a secondary amine, both of which are also used for amine gas treating. MDEA's defining characteristic when compared to these other amines is its ability to preferentially remove H2S (and strip CO2) from sour gas streams. MDEA's popularity as a solvent for gas treating stems from several advantages it has when compared to other alkanolamines. One of these advantages is a low vapor pressure, which allows for high amine compositions without appreciable losses through the absorber and regenerator. MDEA is also resistant to thermal and chemical degradation and is largely immiscible with hydrocarbons. Lastly, MDEA has a relatively low heat of reaction with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, which allows for lower reboiler duties, thus lower operating costs. MDEA blends MDEA is less reactive towards CO2, but has an equilibrium loading capacity approaching 1 mole CO2 per mole amine. It also requires less energy to regenerate. To combine the advantages of MDEA and the smaller amines, MDEA is usually mixed with a catalytic promoter such as piperazine, PZ, or a fast reacting amine such as MEA to retain reactivity, but lower regeneration costs. Activated MDEA or aMDEA uses piperazine as a catalyst to increase the speed of the reaction with CO2. It has been commercially successful. Many tests have been done on the performance of MDEA/MEA or MDEA/piperazine mixtures compared to single amines. CO2 production rates were higher than MEA for the same heat duty and total molar concentration when experiments were performed in the University of Regina pilot plant, which is a modeled after a natural gas plant. There were also insignificant trace amounts of degradation products detected. However, when the same control variables and tests were conducted at the Boundary Dam Power Station plant, the CO2 production rate for the mixed solvent was lower than MEA. This was a result of the reduction in the capacity of the solvent to absorb CO2 after degradation. Because the Boundary Dam plant is a coal-fired power plant, it operates under harsher environments and produces an impure flue gas containing, fly ash, SO2, and NO2 that are fed into carbon capture. Even with flue gas pretreatment, there is still enough to produce degradation products such as straight chain amines and sulfur compounds, which accumulate so it is no longer possible to regenerate MEA and MDEA. For these blends to be successful in reducing heat duty, their chemical stabilities must be maintained. =Degradation= Main oxidative degradation products of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable salts formate, glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an industrial plan that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation is most likely to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 ¬∞C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary Dam plant, emissions increased when CO2 loading of lean amine increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler heat duty, which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and heat duty or energy costs. This compound should not be confused with the recreational drug methylenedioxyethylamphetamine which is also abbreviated MDEA. Production MDEA is produced by ethoxylation of methylamine using ethylene oxide: :CH3NH2 \\\\+ 2 C2H4O ‚Üí CH3N(C2H4OH)2 Another route involves hydroxymethylation of diethanolamine followed by hydrogenolysis.

It is one of several centres making up Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC). History The Centre's roots go back to 1939 when the Department of National Defence (DND) recognized the vital importance of human factors in the ability of Canada's armed forces to safeguard the nation in peacetime and at war. Recognizing the importance of aviation medicine to defence, an inter-departmental committee, the Associate Committee on Aviation Medical Research, was established in June, 1939, chaired by Sir Frederick Banting. Laboratory studies in pressure physiology began in the Banting and Best Institute, University of Toronto, where the first decompression chamber for human studies in Canada was set up. To expand the effort, in 1940, the No.1 Clinical Investigation Unit (No1 CIU) was formed at the former Eglinton Hunt Club at 1107 Avenue Road with the construction of a low-temperature low-pressure chamber to support research on human capabilities under extremes of cold and high altitude. This led to extensive activity in the development of oxygen and survival equipment for the Royal Canadian Air Force. The second significant experimental facility constructed was the first human centrifuge in the allied countries, pioneered by Dr. Wilbur R. Franks and his colleagues. This was brought into operation in late 1941, and by August 1945 more than 13, 000 human runs had been carried out without a mishap. This machine was used to pioneer and create the world's first anti \\"G\\" flying suit to go into service, when it was worn during Operation Torch during the battle for Oran with the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm in November 1942. In the post-war period, research in aviation medicine continued in the universities and at Avenue Road, now renamed the RCAF Institute of Aviation Medicine (RCAF/IAF). It was assigned responsibilities for aviation medical training, medical statistics, aircrew medical selection, life support and survival equipment and clinical aviation medicine. Under unification in 1968, it was renamed the Canadian Forces Institute of Environment Medicine (CFIEM). In 1947, the Defence Research Board (DRB) was established with its primary responsibility in the field of military medicine and the study of occupational problems of the armed services. Basically, DRB was directed to the study of the environmental factors and hazards affecting them, and the assessment of their task with the view of improving their performance in it. To address the new DRB role in military human factors research, the Defence Research Medical Laboratory (DRML) was constructed at Downsview, Ontario in 1952, with the official opening on 12 February 1954. Its program was widened to embrace studies of tri-service applicability and included food and clothing research. This laboratory was renamed the Defence Research Establishment Toronto (DRET) in 1968. In an effort to consolidate the research effort in the military, DRET and CFIEM were amalgamated in April 1971 and a new organization was formed, the Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine. DCIEM had a combined military and civilian research staff, which provided a unique combination of operational and scientific expertise that addressed the operational needs of the Canadian Forces in all environments. Over the years many new unique facilities were developed at DCIEM, including a new human centrifuge, hot and cold climatic chambers, hypobaric (1954) and hyperbaric (1977) chambers, and impact studies facility (1978). The unification of the three services into the Canadian Forces (CF) in 1968 saw DRB evolve, becoming the Research and Development Branch of the CF by 1974. The laboratories of the DRB were integrated to DND through the formation of the Defence Research and Development (R&D;) Branch (DRDB) to forge closer relationships between scientists and the military. The new branch was led by the Chief of Research and Development (CRAD), within the Assistant Deputy Minister (Materiel) group. The Hunt Club location closed in 1994 and its operations moved to Downsview. The R&D; Branch was reorganized on April 1, 2000 when it became Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), part of DND. As Canada's leader in defence and national security science and technology (S&T;), DRDC maintains a broad scientific program and actively collaborates with industry, international allies, academia, other government departments and the national security community. DRDC Toronto and its forebearers have made major contributions to knowledge and equipment which has not only aided the Canadian Forces in the completion of their missions, but has had a significant impact in the civilian sector both in Canada and worldwide. Functions of DRDC Toronto DRDC Toronto is a research and development organisation for integrated human effectiveness, science and technology (S&T;) in defence and national security. It provides the Canadian Forces (CF), government agencies, academia, and industrial clients with an internationally recognized combination of expertise and research facilities. DRDC Toronto uses a systems-based approach to cover all aspects of human performance and effectiveness, including individual and team performance, human-technology interaction, and the social and psychological factors that affect the resolution of conflict. Their scientists and technologists apply, exploit and share the results of research in the following fields: * Human systems integration * Human performance in stressful environments * Simulation and modeling of the human in complex military systems * Human issues in command and control * Team performance and collaborative behaviour * Psychology of malicious intent * Social and cultural factors influencing behaviour Current research initiatives * Behaviourally Realistic Approaches to Security Risk Management: Researchers developed models of risk perception, assessment, and communication in response to realistic asymmetric threat scenarios, such as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorist attacks. * Distributed Team Modeling: Using a software platform based on a problem-solving task requiring information sharing, scientists compared the effectiveness of different team structures using measures of collaboration, information sharing, and trust. * Tools for the Automatic Extraction and Visualization of Concepts: Tools are being developed to improve the analysis of massive quantities of information and intelligence from various sources to support military decision-making. * Rapid Diagnostic Tools for Detecting Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries: In collaboration with Canadian research hospitals and international partners, diagnostic tools are being developed to assist in the identification of mild traumatic brain injuries.

He was a member of the Breton artistic movement Seiz Breur. Terrorism Berthou was born in Paimpol, C√¥tes-d'Armor. He trained as a chemical engineer, then worked full-time as a pharmacist at Guipavas. In 1929 he suggested to fellow chemist and Breton nationalist C√©lestin Lain√© that a militant group dedicated to direct action against the French state and its symbols should be formed. This was to be called Kentoc'h Mervel (Rather Death). As Lain√© sought his own recruits, Berthou brought the staff of the nationalist journal Breiz da Zont to join en masse. When Lain√© discovered this he distanced himself from Berthou, believing that a public journal could not create an effective support for a secret organization, as it would be too easily infiltrated. Lain√© went on to form the terrorist faction Gwenn ha du. Lain√© later wrote \\"I don't know what became of Kentoc'h Mervel after that, except that it never grew beyond fancy words.\\"Daniel Leach, \\"Bezen Perrot: The Breton nationalist unit of the SS, 1943-5\\", e-Keltoi However when Gwenn ha du launched their first attack in 1932, bombing a sculpture, four informants claimed that Berthou had provided the nitroglycerin.Ronan Carl√©on, Gwenn ha Du, 1938. Neo-Druidism Berthou became closely associated with neo-Druidic and Celticist movements, writing poetry in the Breton language. As part of the Aryanist ideologies of the era, he studied the links between ancient Celtic (Brythonic and Gaelic) culture and Hinduism. His esoterism linked him with various Masonic and Aryanist groups. Along with Morvan Marchal and others he participated in the Kredenn Geltiek (Celtic Creed) Druidic group, adopting the bardic name Kerverziou, though also using the pseudonym \\"Iaktimagos Vissurix\\". He contributed to the Celticist journals Gwalarn and Kad. He also founded the periodical Ogam and was president of Les Amis de la Tradition Celtique (Friends of the Celtic Tradition). In his metaphysical poetry written in \\"ancient Gallic\\", he predicted the end of the \\"white race\\" in the year 2018, a date which corresponded to 3888 in his own personal calendar, which he created based on the cycles of the moon and sun, starting with the supposed date of the legendary Irish Battle of Mag Tuired. Collaborationism Berthou's mystical Aryanist ideas were closely linked to aspects of Nazi ideology. He contributed to the openly pro-Nazi review Stur, edited by Olier Mordrel, and also contributed to other pro-Nazi periodicals. During the war he was involved with the Institut Celtique, created by the Occupation government. Nevertheless, Berthou's involvement remained purely literary.

He became a member of the London Society of Antiquaries in 1747, and as its lawyer, was responsible for securing the incorporation of the Society in 1751. This act was important in putting the society on level terms, in terms of finance and national prestige, with the Royal Society, which some antiquaries saw as a rival.R. Sweet, Antiquaries: The Discovery of the Past in Eighteenth-Century Britain,(Great Britain: Cambridge University Press, 2004), pp.89-91 Webb has remembered also as an agent of the crown in the North Briton scandal (1763), assisting Robert Wood to seize the papers of radical journalist John Wilkes, whose inflammatory writings had offended the king. Early life He was born at Devizes in Wiltshire, and was admitted attorney-at-law on 20 June 1724. He practised at first in Old Jewry, then moved to Budge Row, and afterwards settled in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On 18 December 1727 he was admitted at the Middle Temple, and on 8 April 1741 was admitted at Lincoln's Inn. Early in his career, he acquired a reputation for knowledge of records and of precedents on constitutional law. After the suppression of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 he acted for the state as solicitor in trials of the prisoners. Lord Hardwicke made him secretary of bankrupts in the court of chancery, and he retained the post until 1766, when Lord Northington ceased to be lord chancellor. In politics Webb was elected F.S.A. on 26 November 1747 and F.R.S. on 9 November 1749, and in 1751 he assisted materially in obtaining the charter of incorporation for the Society of Antiquaries. In 1748 he purchased the estate of Busbridge, near the borough of Haslemere in Surrey, which gave him considerable influence in a rotten borough. He sat for Haslemere in the parliaments from 1754 to 1761 and from 1761 to 1768. The first of these elections elicited in 1754 the ballad, attributed to Dr. William King, of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, of ‚ÄòThe Cow of Haslemere,‚Äô which had eight calves, for each of which a vote in Webb's interest was claimed. The Wilkes case In December 1756 Webb was made joint-solicitor to the treasury, and held that post until June 1765; he was consequently a leading official in the proceedings against John Wilkes, and for his acts was dubbed by Horace Walpole ‚Äòa most villainous tool and agent in any iniquity,‚Äô ‚Äòthat dirty wretch,‚Äô and ‚Äòa sorry knave.‚Äô In the action brought against Wood, Lord Egremont's secretary, for seizing Wilkes's papers, Webb, as a witness, swore that while in the house he had no key in his hand. For this he was tried before Lord Mansfield, with a special jury, for perjury, on 22 May 1764. The trial lasted seven hours, and the jury, after an absence of nearly an hour, returned a verdict of not guilty. A motion by Sir Joseph Mawbey in November 1768 for a return of all moneys paid to Webb for prosecutions was refused. On the charge made in the House of Commons on 31 January 1769 that Webb had bribed with public money Michael Curry, to betray Wilkes and give evidence against him, counsel pleaded on behalf of Webb that he was now blind and of impaired intellect, and the motion against him was defeated. Death Memorial in the Church of St. Peter & St. Paul, Godalming Webb died at his seat of Busbridge Hall on 22 June 1770. Works He was the author of Remarks on the Pretender's Declaration and Commission, 1745, dated from Lincoln's Inn on 12 October in that year, and of Remarks on the Pretender's Eldest Son's Second Declaration, 1745, which came out subsequently. Webb was the leader in seizing, among the papers of Wilkes, the poem of the Essay on Woman; and when the legality of general warrants was impugned, he printed privately and anonymously a volume of Copies taken from the Records of the Court of King's Bench, the Office-books of the Secretaries of State, of Warrants issued by Secretaries of State, 1763. He also printed Some Observations on the late determination for Discharging Mr. Wilkes from the Tower. By a Member of the House of Commons, 1763. Other works of Webb were: * A Letter to Rev. William Warburton on some Passages in the ‚ÄúDivine Legation of Moses.‚Äù By a Gentleman of Lincoln's Inn, 1742. Reply to The Divine Legation of Moses. * Observations on the course of Proceedings in the Admiralty Courts, 1747. * Excerpta ex Instrumentis Publicis de Jud√¶is, 1753. * Short but True State of Facts relative to the Jew Bill, 1753. * The Question whether a Jew born within the British Dominions could before the late Act purchase and hold Lands.

On 12 March 1760 he presented this table, one of the Tables of Heraclea, to the king of Spain, through the Neapolitan minister, for the royal collection at Naples, and he received in return a diamond ring. Webb wrote in the Moderator and contributed to the Philosophical Transactions. John Topham served under him. Collector The manuscripts of Sir Julius C√¶sar were dispersed by auction in 1757, and nearly one-third of the collection was purchased by Webb. These, with his other manuscripts on paper, were bought from his widow by Lord Shelburne, and later went to the Lansdowne manuscripts at the British Museum. Webb sold to the House of Lords thirty manuscript volumes of the rolls of parliament, and the rest of his library, including his manuscripts on vellum, was sold on 25 February 1771 and sixteen following days. His most valuable coins and medals were acquired by Matthew Duane; the remainder and his ancient marble busts and bronzes were sold in 1771. On the death of his widow his other collections were sold by Abraham Langford. Naturalist A letter from Emanuel Mendes da Costa to Webb is in John Nichols's Illustrations of Literature (iv. 788‚Äì9). In July 1758 he obtained from the Society of Arts a silver medal for having planted a large quantity of acorns for timber. Family He married, on 2 November 1730, Susanna, daughter of Benjamin Lodington, many years consul at Tripoli. She died at Bath on 12 March 1756, aged 45, leaving one son, also called Philip Carteret Webb (d. 10 October 1793). Two other children died in infancy, and, at her own desire, Mrs. Webb was buried with them in a cave in the grounds at Busbridge. They were afterwards disinterred and placed in a vault under Godalming church, with a monument to her and her husband. In August 1758 Webb married Rhoda, daughter of John or James Cotes of Dodington in Cheshire, and by her had no issue. He bequeathed to her everything that he could. She married, on 5 September 1771, Edward Bever of Farnham, Surrey, and in 1775 sold the estate of Busbridge.

The Association co- ordinates, develops and promotes horsemanship in Victoria and instruction for its members. The Association is a member of Pony Club Australia. Children and young adults to the age of 25 learn the skills of riding and general horsemanship and compete in local events, but can also go on to compete at state, national and international events. Pony Club is one of the few sports were males and females compete on equal terms. Victoria is divided into 10 Zones currently comprising 210 Clubs. Each club is organized and arranged separately, but the Zone also has an organizing Committee. Each Zone also has a Chief Instructor whose duty is to supervise and encourage the instruction policy within the Zone. Each Zone sends Councillors to Association meetings to determine general policy. In each Zone there are as many as 30 different Pony Clubs. Aims and ObjectivesPCAV Mission *To encourage young people to ride and to learn to enjoy all approved types of sport connected with horses and riding *To provide instruction in horsemanship and riding and to instill in the members the proper care of their animals. *To promote the highest ideals of sportsmanship, citizenship and loyalty, thereby cultivating strength of character and self-discipline. Membership Membership is open to anyone. Junior members are under 17 years, Associate members are 17 and under 25 years and Senior Members are 25 years and over. Only Junior and Associate members are allowed to compete or receive instruction and certificates''' Throughout their Pony Club career, riders are encouraged to undertake various efficiency certificates according to their age and ability, commencing with the basic ‚ÄòD‚Äô certificate through to ‚ÄòA‚Äô certificate which is the highest level. These certificates aim to encourage the interest and improvement in knowledge of its members. They are viewed as a measure of a rider‚Äôs progress in their overall efficiency. In working for them riders acquire valuable knowledge and skills, which enhance their riding experience. Competitions To supplement Rally Days there are other activities offered such as gymkhanas, camps, trail rides, lectures and films, visits to places of interest and demonstrations. Inter- club competitions are often held in the form of a Gymkhana, which has a mix of show riding events, Sporting and Showjumping competitions. Zone championships are generally held once a year for most disciplines, including Dressage, Show Jumping, One Day Eventing, Horse Trials, Sporting, Flat teams, and Mounted Games. State Championships are held at roughly the same times each year. Clothing and Uniforms Each member is required to wear the following at all times, while mounted: * Well fitting Pony Club approved helmet * Smooth soled riding boots. Each club sets its own uniform. This will generally include an informal uniform for club rally days such as a club polo shirt and a formal uniform, consisting of a long-sleeved shirt, tie, and jumper or vest. Each club will normally have its own saddle cloth. Each Zone and State also have their own colours and uniforms. Zone representatives in state competitions must wear the Zone's colours. =Examples of club jumper colour schemes= *Apollo Bay Pony Club: Royal Blue and Orange. *Portarlington and District Pony Club: Purple with a Yellow Sash *Shepparton Pony Club: Royal Blue with a Light Blue Sash. *Trafalgar Pony Club: Red. Example: The North Eastern Zone The North Eastern Zone comprises the Pony Clubs in the North Eastern part of Victoria. There are 17 Pony Clubs in this Zone: *Alexandra & District Pony Club *Benalla Pony Club *Bethanga Pony Club *Bright & District Pony Club *Chiltern & District Pony Club *Euroa Pony Club *Howlong Pony Club *Kergunyah Pony Club *Mansfield Pony Club *Moyhu Pony Club) *Myrtleford Pony Club *Numurkah & District Pony Club *Seymour Pony Club *Shepparton Pony Club *Wangaratta Pony Club *Wodonga & District Pony Club *Yarrawonga Pony Club Each of these clubs has its own meeting place, uniforms, shows, rally/training days, sponsors, and committees. Meeting places Quite a few Pony Clubs, such as Bacchus Marsh and Sale, use the local showgrounds. Some clubs, such as Werribee, use special horse facilities like the Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre. Other clubs, such as the Dandenong Ranges Horse and Pony Club and Yarra Glen & District Pony Club have their own grounds which either belong to the club or are leased from the Local Council. The Pony Clubs themselves normally pay for the upkeep and maintenance of facilities, although often government grants will supplement club finances such as the 2008 sand arena at Drysdale/Leopold Pony Club.City of Greater Geelong council news, 4 April 2008 History PCAV was formed at a meeting held at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds on 13 January 1954, with seven affiliated clubs - Berwick, Eltham, Footscray, Mountain District, Shepparton, Vermont and Western District. While Vermont and Footscray have since disbanded, they continue on in their areas as Nunawading District Horse and Pony Club and Truganina Pony Club. Rapid increase in membership in the 1960s necessitated the formation of Zones (areas) to facilitate administration and organisation. Ultimately 10 Zones were formed - each more or less geographical in concept, with a membership ranging from 10 to 16 Clubs each.

Hallam, Domesday Book through Nine Centuries, (London: Thames and Hudson Ltd., 1986), p. 134 In 1753 he was approached by Philip Carteret Webb to make a transcript from Domesday Book; this he did, and, perhaps in return for Webb‚Äôs help in raising awareness of Domesday‚Äôs importance, waived the usual fee ‚Äì two years later Webb‚Äôs paper on the Book was read to the Society of Antiquaries of London. In later life Farley was to produce the first printed edition of Domesday Book, which was then much in demand. Following a Parliamentary order in 1767, Farley was appointed co-editor of the Domesday printing project in 1770, alongside Charles Morton of the British Museum. In his Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century, the printer John Nichols remarked that Morton and Farley‚Äôs relationship was characterised by rivalry and mistrust. Farley, whom Nichols called \\"of all men the properest person for so important a trust\\", due to his \\"long and intimate acquaintance with the original record\\",Jonathan Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century Vol. III (London: Nichols, son, and Bentley, 1812), p. 266 evidently considered himself best fitted to produce the landmark work.

Fall, 2009. Arch of Titus Digital Restoration Project Project Goals The Arch of Titus in Rome commemorates the Emperor Titus‚Äô victory in the Jewish War (66-73 CE). This iconic monument contains bas reliefs of Titus‚Äô triumphal procession through Rome, including a depiction of the seven-branched menorah from the Jerusalem Temple. Long significant for Christian art, this menorah is the symbol of modern Israel. Like the other reliefs on the Arch, the original colors of the menorah relief are no longer visible. New conservation techniques have been successfully recovered traces of the original colors on ancient monuments. We will apply these to the study of the Arch: Noninvasive UV-VIS Absorption Spectrometry will be employed to it for the first time to capture traces of pigments on the relief, and 3D scanning will be used for the first time to capture the geometric detail of the relief. We hope to create the first reconstruction of the polychromy of the relief using the new digital tools for painting and displaying 3D models. The results may transform our understanding of the Arch of Titus, especially the menorah panel, whose original coloration is unknown. Significance Recent scholarship has focused on the significance of polychromy in classical art and architecture. This will be the first study to restore the color on a monument from the Flavian period. This project also has the potential to give us our first glimpse of the colors used to decorate the sacred vessels of the Jerusalem Temple. Given the importance of the Arch of Titus as a Flavian Roman monument and of Temple and its menorah in Judaism and Christianity, our project may transform the way we visualize and conceptualize Roman state architecture as well as the central monument of ancient Judaism, the Jerusalem Temple. The final results of the project will be made available at no cost on the project‚Äôs Web site and in a printed scholarly publication, and will also be presented at a scholarly conference. The findings will also be integrated into the 3D digital model of the Arch in Rome Reborn: A Digital Model of Ancient Rome. Participants An international team of art historians, conservators and historians will be assembled to study the reliefs of the Arch of Titus in all of their complexity. A technology team headed by co-director Bernard Frischer will focus on the technical retrieval of evidence of polychromy, scanning of the reliefs and 3D digital modeling of the Arch. A team led by co-director Peter Schertz will focus on the Roman context of the Arch, including the topographical, artistic and political issues that naturally arise in any study of the monument. Director Steven Fine will oversee the entire project and lead a team dedicated to the interpretation of the Arch within Jewish and Christian contexts, from antiquity to the present.

He indeed considered that in tissue, only limited populations of cells are able to divide. He even compares the tissue to a colony of bees, in which only the Queen ensures reproduction. In contrast, most of the other bees are sterile workers.¬´ Carcinogenic mechanisms: Anticancer drugs that target tumor metabolism ¬ª, Maurice Isra√´l, Laurent Schwartz (trad.

Hypothesis Gernez looked for volunteers to create a universal blood bank by immune adoption because he believed that for a few months after birth, it would be possible to prevent allergy and help organ transplant transforming blood type into group AB, and that organic foods and growth hormone regulation actively prevent against degenerative diseases. On 25 January 2006, Radio Canada announced that the Hospital for Sick Children of Toronto transplanted hearts to babies aged from 0 to 14 months successfully. As tumor cell colony of less than cells remains indetectable for imagery, the yearly procedure proposed by Gernez for preventing cancer consists of three essential parts: # apply a low calorie regime during a fasting period, as recommended by most religions; # eat more fruits, vegetables, less meat, consume products rich in magnesium, vitamins C, E, selenium; # kill tumor cells by giving for a few days an anti-mitotic, such as colchicine.¬´ Carcinogenic mechanisms: Anticancer drugs that target tumor metabolism ¬ª, Maurice Isra√´l, Laurent Schwartz (trad.

This technology would be practiced in the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and in Asia with barefoot doctors. In 1989 Gernez created an association, Organic Union International (OUI), in favor of self- medication with doctors Jacques Lacaze and Jean-Pierre Willem. He died aged 90 in 2014.

The mill was also known as Blackness Mill and the White Mill. History Stone Cross Windmill was built in 1876 by Stephen Neve, the Warbleton millwright. The towe was built by Thomas Honeysett, a local bricklayer and fitted out by Neve with machinery supplied by the Phoenix Iron Foundry, Lewes. Two sails were blown off in 1925. It was working by wind until 1937. The mill was used as an observation post during the Second World War. In January 1962, planning permission was granted to convert the mill into a house. Mr Ron Hall, the owner of the Mill House, bought the mill and outbuildings, and decided to restore the mill instead of converting it to residential use. In 1966, Mr Hall started to repair the mill, which in 1977 was in a similar condition to when it stopped working, with two sails and missing the fantail. By the 1990s, the mill was getting into disrepair, and a trust was formed to buy and restore the mill. Stone Cross Mill Trust became a registered charity in 1996, and work to restore the mill began in 1998. The mill was able to produce wholemeal flour again in 2000. In 2005, the Trust were awarded a plaque by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings \\"in recognition of the high quality of the restoration of the mill back to working order\\". Funding for the restoration was provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, South East England Development Agency, East Sussex County Council and Wealden District Council. Two sails were removed in 2009 for repairs, while the other pair of sails and cap were also removed for repairs in 2011. Stone Cross Mill is twinned with De Wachter, Zuidlaren, Netherlands. Description Stone Cross Windmill is a five-storey tower mill with a stage at first floor level. the mill has a domed cap which is winded by a fantail. It has four Patent sails carried on a cast iron Windshaft. The diameter Brake Wheel is iron. The three pairs of millstones are overdriven.

It is acceptably interchangeable with most responses. > \\"What time do you want to go out tonight?\\" \\"Meh.\\" Also considered a non-committal response, \\"meh\\" can be used when disregarding a question or to refer to something they have no opinion or emotions about. In expressing an opinion, it means the speaker's opinion is that of apathy. However, some may respond with \\"meh\\" simply to avoid creating an opinion on the matter at all. > \\"Do you want to go to the party with me?\\" \\"Meh.\\" > \\"What did you think about the book we had to read?\\" \\"Meh.\\" Origin The origin is unknown. Some have speculated that the term's origin is Yiddish because of its similarity to the interjection \\"feh\\", which appears in the 1936 Yiddish song Yidl Mitn Fidl. In Alexander Harkavy's Yiddish- English-Hebrew Dictionary the word is treated as a bleating or baa sound. Hooray for Yiddish, by Leo Rosten uses the word \\"mnyeh\\", which is speculated to be an early variant of \\"meh\\". Popularization As early as 1992, meh appeared in a Usenet posting in a discussion referring to the television series Melrose Place. Mehs popularity surged after its use on the American animated television series The Simpsons. It was first used in the 1994 episode \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\", when a librarian reacts to Lisa's surprise that voting records are not classified. It also appeared later in \\"Lisa's Wedding\\" after Marge weaves the words \\"Hi Bart\\" on a loom to try to pique her son's interest in weaving, to which he responds \\"meh\\". In the 2001 episode \\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\", Lisa spells out the word for emphasis (\\"M-E-H\\"), after Homer tries to interest her (Lisa) and Bart into going to the theme park \\"Blockoland\\". American lexicographer Benjamin Zimmer wrote in 2006, \\"Whatever Yiddish origins the interjection might have had, they have been lost in post-Simpsons usage.\\" Zimmer contacted Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder, who was responsible for \\"Hungry Hungry Homer\\", who said \\"I had originally heard the word from an advertising writer named Howie Krakow back in 1970 or 1971 who insisted it was the funniest word in the world.\\" Zimmer also contacted the writers of the other two episodes but they could not remember where they had heard the word. Lexicographer Grant Barrett wrote about meh and d'oh, another Simpsons catchphrase: \\"I suspect they're both just transcribed versions of oral speech, which has any number of single-syllable sounds that mean a variety of things\\". Even mainstream publications have adopted usage of meh. The word's first mainstream print usage occurred in Canadian newspaper the Edmonton Sun in 2003: \\"Ryan Opray got voted off Survivor. Meh\\". In December 2009, meh was included in the BBC News Online list of 20 words which defined the decade. On October 14, 2013, ABC News posted on their website under headlines: US Government Shuts Down, World Says, 'Meh'. The New York Timess The One Page Magazine now features a \\"meh\\" list. Meh.com, a daily deals website from Woot founder Matt Rutledge, debuted on July 9, 2014. Rutledge paid $100,000 for the meh.com domain in June 2014. Inclusion in dictionaries In November 2008, the word was added to the Collins English Dictionary, a British publication published by Harper Collins. Cormac McKeown, senior editor for Collins dictionaries, said: > \\"This is a new interjection from the US that seems to have inveigled its way > into common speech over here.\\" > \\"It was actually spelled out in The Simpsons when Homer is trying to pry the > kids away from the TV with a suggestion for a day trip. They both just reply > 'meh' and keep watching TV; he asks again and Lisa says 'We said MEH! M-E-H, > meh?!'\\" Sam Leith, writing in The Daily Telegraph, described the addition of the word, following suggestions received from the public, as a \\"gimmick\\", before concluding it was a \\"useful\\" word. =In Canada= Harper Collins' definition of \\"meh\\" included a \\"real example\\" of usage: > \\"As in 'the Canadian election was so meh'.\\" When complaints arose over this choice of example, Harper Collins' lexicographer Cormac McKeown, who chose the election reference, insisted that he meant \\"no slight to Canada\\".

Hunziker was born and raised in Switzerland, emigrated to the U.S., and studied at Cornell University. He started and developed the dairy program at Purdue University when such programs were at their infancy. At this same time, Hunziker was heavily involved with the development of the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA) and the standardization and improvement of many dairy tests and processes. Hunziker wrote several of the leading dairy processing texts, which continue to be cited. After leaving Purdue University, Hunziker managed research and operations at a large, national condensary, continued to drive ADSA's standardization and publishing efforts, represented the U.S. at international dairy congresses, and facilitated dairy industry improvements across the globe. Early years Otto Frederick Hunziker was born in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, on 25 December 1873 to Karl Otto and Luise (Pupikofer) Hunziker. Otto's siblings were Karl Rudolf (born 5 February 1870, Z√ºrich), Barbara Luise (17 June 1871 ‚Äì 16 October 1871), and Marie Julie (23 July 1872 ‚Äì 30 June 1938). Hunziker spent many early years in Goldbach, Switzerland, where his father was a pastor, professor, and member of the canton parliament. Otto attended the two-year course of studies at Strickhof Agricultural College in Z√ºrich, graduating at age 19. In 1893, Otto Frederick Hunziker emigrated to the United States. During this time period, significant new development in dairy processing technology was occurring on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1890, Stephen Babcock published specifications for the Babcock test for milk fat content. In 1892, Dr. Niklaus Gerber acquired a Swiss patent on the Gerber method for analyzing fat content in milk. Dr. Gerber was based in Z√ºrich, had studied at the University of Z√ºrich, and worked for two years at the Swiss-American Milk Company in Little Falls, New York. Hunziker would spend a substantial amount of time studying and improving these analytic methods. In the United States, Hunziker worked for two years as a laborer on a dairy farm near Attleboro, Massachusetts. To improve his English and commercial skills, he studied at Bryant and Stratton Business College (now Bryant University), Providence, Rhode Island in 1896. He returned to Switzerland briefly in 1898 before returning to receive a B.S. Agriculture in 1900 and M.S.A. in 1901 from Cornell University. He served as an assistant in charge of dairy bacteriology at Cornell University until 1902, when he equipped and operated a dairy manufacturing research laboratory for the Scranton Condensed Milk Company in Ellicottville, New York. Otto Frederick married Florence Belle Burne on 10 April 1905 in Portville, Cattaraugus County, New York.Cornell Alumni News, Vol VII, No. 20, (21 Feb 1906), p. 237 Professorship at Purdue In 1905 Hunziker accepted a position at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana as head of Purdue's Dairy Department.Cornell Alumni News, Vol XII, No. 7, (10 Nov 1909), p. 82 Dairy departments were relatively new at American colleges. (The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the University of Wisconsin in 1890.) Hunziker led Purdue's dairy department through significant growth. From the abstract: \\"During the organizational year of the American Dairy Science Association, Otto F. Hunziker led the dairy program at Purdue University. A charter member of ADSA and its third president, Dr. Hunziker's brilliant career as a scientist, teacher and author is recognized throughout the world. At Purdue he provided leadership in developing educational programs to better educate dairymen. His research programs established the accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream. He planned Smith Hall, which was built in 1913 to provide facilities for teaching, research and extension work.\\"The 1906 Purdue yearbook (the Debris Vol 18) lists: \\"Otto Fred Hunziker, Instructor in Dairying; B.S.A., Cornell University, 1900; M.S.A., 1901; Sigma Xi\\". The only other \\"dairying\\" faculty listed is one Hubert Everett Van Norman who is listed as \\"Resigned\\". The 1907 Debris indicates Hunziker was promoted to associate professor; the only other \\"dairying\\" faculty is one John deMoss Jarvis, assistant in dairying. The following year, Hunziker is listed as a full professor. In 1910, Hunziker's position is listed as professor of dairy husbandry and as a member of the Official Dairy Instructors' Association (ODIA). John deMoss Jarvis remains the only other dairy faculty, but became an instructor in 1909. In the 1911‚Äì1914 yearbooks, Hunziker is listed as president of ODIA as well as a member of the Indiana Academy of Science, Indiana State Dairy Association, and Indiana Jersey Cattle Club. The 1911 Debris also lists two dairy instructors and one assistant. In the new \\"Experiment Station\\" section, Hunziker is listed \\"Chief of Dairy Husbandry\\". The 1914 Debris lists Alpha Zeta and the Purdue Dairy Club for the first time; apart from Hunziker, two associates and an assistant are listed as faculty members of the dairy club. In the summer of 1906, Hunziker was among 18 teachers and investigators meeting at the University of Illinois, Urbana, to found what was then known as National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators. (The following year, this association changed its name to \\"Official Dairy Instructors' Association\\" and, in 1916, changed its name to \\"American Dairy Science Association\\" (ADSA).) From 1910 to 1926, Hunziker chaired ADSA's Committee on Official Methods of Testing Milk and Cream for Butterfat. In 1911, this committee met in Washington, D.C. with the U.S. Bureau of Dairying, the U.S. Bureau of Standards and manufacturers of glassware. Standard specifications for Babcock glassware were published as a result of this meeting. Hunziker actively pursued numerous improvements to the testing methodology, which improved the quality and safety of dairy products. Hunziker was the third president of ADSA from 1910 through 1911. During Hunziker's presidency, ADSA also: created a national score card for scoring dairies; standardized dairy judging contests; secured scholarships for student contests; improved national milk standards; developed ties with breed associations; and, provided fora for industry discussions on dairy instruction and extension services.: \\"The contributions of Otto F. Hunziker, Purdue University, to the Association extended far beyond his early 2-year presidency, 1910 and 1911. For many years he was the dedicated member of the Journal Management Committee, nurturing the newly founded journal as if it were his very own. As an administrator, author, and researcher, his presence at a meeting assured its success. There was authority in his deliberate, well-chosen words. He represented the dairy manufacturers of America five times at the world's dairy congresses‚ÄîLondon, 1928; Copenhagen, 1931; Berlin, 1937; Stockholm, 1949; den Hague, 1953‚Äîa record that stood for many years. For his sustained enthusiasm for the American Dairy Science Association at home or abroad, he might well have been named 'Mr. ADSA'. He too, was listed among the 'Ten Master Minds of Dairying'.\\" Smith Hall, Purdue University, 1913Apart from application of improved pedagogy and scientific methodology, Hunziker oversaw planning and construction of Smith Hall, the building which thereafter housed Purdue's dairy manufacturing group, extension service, and creamery. While at Purdue, he published over 50 bulletins, leaflets, and scientific treatises addressing dairy farm and plant problems. In 1917, Hunziker left Purdue to manage manufacturing and research at the Blue Valley Creamery Company in Chicago, Illinois. Professional life O. F. HunzikerHunziker wrote dairy articles and textbooks used throughout the world, developed dairy curricula, advocated for dairy laws, and developed standard testing methodology. In particular, Hunziker authored The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory, a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940). The Butter Industry (or its author) was \\"recognized by the Ontario Department of Agriculture as an expert on butter quality\\".The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock officially recommended The Butter Industry with only 4 other texts for those studying to test dairy products. A book that Hunziker originally self-published in 1914, \\"Condensed Milk and Milk Powder: Prepared for the Use of Milk Condenseries, Dairy Students and Pure Food Departments\\", was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press. According to one book review: \\"The popularity of this book may be judged by the fact that this is the fourth edition, the three previous editions having long since been exhausted. The book is the most important contribution on the condensed milk and milk powder industry. It should be in the library of the teacher, the student or factory man interested in any phase of the condensed milk and milk powder industry.\\" Both books are listed by Cornell University as \\"Core Historical Literature of Agriculture\\". In the 1920s, Hunziker initiated a \\"dairy school over the air\\"‚Äîa radio program on WGN for which dairy experts were invited to discuss various issues. Hunziker was a director of the National Dairy Council and is listed in The Ten Master Minds of Dairying. Individual article, compiled into \\"The Ten Master Minds of Dairying\\". Republished Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company, 1967, ; New York, Burt Franklin, 1970, When the World's Dairy Congress was held in the U.S. in 1923, the U.S. Department of Agriculture selected Hunziker to head the industry and economics program. He later represented the United States at World Dairy Congresses in London, 1928; Copenhagen, 1931; Berlin, 1937; Stockholm, 1949; and The Hague, 1953. He obtained several United States patents, including: and . At Blue Valley, Hunziker established a research program for 22 creameries and two milk plants. In 1932, Purdue University bestowed an honorary doctoral degree in science. He retired from Blue Valley Creamery in 1939 to work as a consultant. In 1942, O F Hunziker was honored with the first ADSA honorary life membership. Hunziker was awarded numerous international honors for his work, including: *1925: Diploma from Italian government for scientific papers at Milan International Exposition *1927: Australian Dairy Council *1928: Swiss gold medal *1934: A.D.S.A. Distinguished Service Scroll *1942: \\"Grande Diploma de Honra\\", Brazilian Instituto‚ÄïTecnico Industrial *1950: Honorary membership in \\"Tu Sociedad Espanola de Bromatologia\\" (Spain) Family life All three of Hunziker's sons attended Purdue University. Children of Otto and Florence were: * Thelma Belle (Raymond Alton Tipple), born 12 November 1905, Ellicottville, New York, died 4 February 1995, Dallas, Texas. * Florence Louise (Carroll Dunham Galvin), born 15 December 1906 in Indiana, died 27 January 1980, Concord, California. * Karl Otto, born 27 June 1908, Lafayette, Indiana, died 3 November 1932, West Lafayette, Indiana, in an automobile accident while a student at Purdue. * Walter Burne (Mary Ann Murphy Hyer), born 1 Aug 1910, Indiana, died April 1971, Alexandria, Louisiana, graduated from Purdue in 1931 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, as business manager of the Purdue Engineer magazine, and as a member in the band, orchestra, and Delta Chi. * Isabelle Mary (Milton Eugene Kerr), born 8 March 1912, Indiana, died 16 January 1994 in Oakland, California. * Otto Frederick, Jr., born 5 September 1915, Lafayette, Indiana, died 19 August 1993, Osprey, Florida, graduated from Purdue in 1937 with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and as a member of the Cary Club and Kappa Delta Rho. Otto (Sr.) was on the board of the La Grange First Methodist Church and the La Grange Federal Savings and Loan Association as well as active in the Civic Club, Kiwanis Club, and American-Swiss Chamber of Commerce. Hobbies included water sports, mountain climbing, ice skating and gardening. Death and posthumous honors Otto Frederick Hunziker died on 16 November 1959 in La Grange, Illinois. A portrait of Hunziker and plaque hang in Purdue's Smith Hall. In 1964, 283 leaders in the dairy industry were asked to name contributors most significantly shaping the dairy industry. Hunziker was listed third, ahead of such well-known industry luminaries as Gail Borden. He was also inducted into the National Dairy Shrine as a \\"pioneer\\".National Dairy Shrine Notes References 2nd Ed. (LaGrange, Illinois: author, 1918), 3rd Ed.

During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, known as the Uranverein. After the war, he was a department director in the high-voltage section of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, in Mainz, and a supernumerary professor at the University of Mainz. Education From 1932 to 1938, Jensen studied at the Universit√§t G√∂ttingen and the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. He received his doctorate in 1938, under Georg Joos at the University of G√∂ttingen.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Peter Jensen. Career In 1938, Jensen was a volunteer in Walther Bothe's Institut f√ºr Physik at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, reorganized and renamed in 1948 the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung), in Heidelberg. He was a teaching assistant there to Walther Bothe from 1939 to 1946. During this time, Jensen worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club); his work with Walther Bothe, Arnold Flammersfeld, and Wolfgang Gentner appeared as Internal Reports in the Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics) . Jensen completed his Habilitation at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg in 1943. The subject of his Habilitationsschrift was on nuclear cross sections of neutron scattering experiments conducted at the University of Heidelberg.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Peter Jensen. In the latter years of World War II, Berlin scientific organizations moved equipment and personnel out of the city to escape effects of Allied air raids. The Kaiser- Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had partly evacuated to Hechingen and Haigerloch in southern Germany. The Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor) B 8 (B-VIII) was constructed in Haigerloch. The construction of the reactor utilized 1.5 tons of heavy water, 1.5 tons of uranium, and 10 tons of graphite. The configuration was uranium in the form of cubes (40 chains of 9 cubes each and 38 chains of 8 cubes each) in heavy water surrounded by graphite. The report on the B 8 experiment was written by Fritz Bopp, Erich Fischer, Werner Heisenberg, and Karl Wirtz from the KWIP and Walther Bothe, Peter Jensen, and Oskar Ritter from the KWImF.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 377 and 377n73.Bericht √ºber den Versuch B8 in Haigerloch, as cited in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 377n73.Walker, 1993, 103 and 152. From 1946 to 1953, Jensen was Wolfgang Gentner‚Äôs teaching assistant at the University of Freiburg; from 1953 to 1954 he was a senior assistant there. From 1947 he was a lecturer, and from 1951 he was a supernumerary professor (nichtplanm√§√üiger Professor) focusing on the installation of a Van de Graaff generator for experiments in nuclear physics.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Peter Jensen. From 1954, he was a department director in the high-voltage section of the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Chemie - Otto Hahn Institut, in Mainz, and he was a supernumerary professor at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Peter Jensen. Internal reports The following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E; see the entry for Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte.Walker, 1993, 268-274. *Arnold Flammersfeld, Peter Jensen, Wolfgang Gentner Die Energiet√∂nung der Uranspaltung G-25 (21 May 1940) *Arnold Flammersfeld, Peter Jensen, Wolfgang Gentner Die Aufteilungsverh√§ltnisse und Energiet√∂nung bei der Uranspaltung G-26 (24 September 1940) *Walther Bothe and Peter Jensen Die Absorption thermischer Neutronen in Elektrogrphit G-71 (20 January 1941) *Walther Bothe and Peter Jensen Resonanzeinfang an einer Uranoberfl√§che G-72 (12 May 1941) *Peter Jensen Eine weitere Bestimmung des Absorptionsquerschnittes von 38Pr√§parat 38, 38-Oxyd, and 38 were the cover names for uranium oxide; see Deutsches Museum. f√ºr thermische Neutronen G-98 (28 July 1941)  Selected bibliography  * Institutional affiliation: Institut f√ºr Physik am Kaiser Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung, Heidelberg.

Some urban wildlife, such as house mice, are synanthropic, ecologically associated with and even evolved to become entirely dependent on humans. For instance, the range of many synanthropic species is expanded to latitudes at which they could not survive the winter outside of human settlements. Other species simply tolerate cohabiting with humans and using the remaining urban forests, green spaces and street/garden vegetation as niche habitats, in some cases gradually becoming so accustomed around humans thus eventually synanthropic over time. These species represent a minority of the creatures that would normally inhabit an area. For example, a 2014 compilation of studies found that only 8% of native bird and 25% of native plant species were present in urban areas compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. Urban wildlife can be found at any latitude that supports human dwellings - the list of animals that will scavenge from human trash within settlements runs from tropical monkeys to polar bears in the Arctic. Different types of urban areas support different kinds of wildlife. One general feature of bird species that adapt well to urban environments is they tend to be the species with bigger brains, perhaps allowing them to be more adaptable to the changeable urban environment. Evolution Urban environments can exert novel selective pressures on organisms sometimes leading to new adaptations. For example, the weed Crepis sancta, found in France, has two types of seed, heavy and fluffy. The heavy ones land near the parent plant, whereas the fluffy seeds float further away on the wind. In urban environments, seeds that float far often land on infertile concrete. Within about 5-12 generations the weed has been found to evolve to produce significantly more heavy seeds than its rural relatives. Among vertebrates, a case is urban great tits, which have been found to sing at a higher pitch than their rural relatives so that their songs stand out above the city noise, although this is probably a learned rather than evolved response. Urban silvereyes, an Australian bird, make contact calls that are higher frequency and slower than those of rural silvereyes. As it appears that contact calls are instinctual and not learnt, this has been suggested as evidence that urban silvereyes have undergone recent evolution so as to better communicate in noisy urban environments. Broadly distributed Some urban species have a cosmopolitan (i.e. nonselective) distribution, in some cases almost global. They include house mice, cockroaches, silverfish, black rats, brown rats, house sparrows, rock doves, and feral populations of domestic species. Africa Penguins nesting in a roadside suburban storm drain As Africa becomes increasingly urbanized, native animals are exposed to this new environment with the potential of uniquely African urban ecologies developing. In the Cape Town urban area in South Africa, there is increasing conflict between human development and nearby populations of Chacma baboons due to baboons growing dependence on tourists and the urban environment as sources of food. Elsewhere in Africa, vervet monkeys as well as baboons adapt to urbanization, and similarly enter houses and gardens for food. African penguins are also known to invade urban areas, searching for food and a safe place to breed. Simon's Town, next to the popular Boulders Beach had to take action to restrict penguin movement due to the noise and damage they caused. There are reports of leopards roaming suburban areas in cities such as Nairobi, Kenya and Windhoek, Namibia. Reptiles like the house gecko (Hemidactylus) can be found in houses. Australia Urban areas in Australia are a particularly fruitful habitat type for many wildlife species. Australian cities are hotspots for threatened species diversity and have been shown to support more threatened animal and plant species on a per unit-area basis than all other non-urban habitat types. An analysis of urban sensitive bird species (birds that are easily disturbed and displaced) found that revegetation was effective at encouraging birds back into urban greenspaces, but also found that weed control was not. Invasive plant species such as Lantana (L. camara) actually provides refuge for some bird species such as the superb fairy (Malurus cyaneus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), in the absence of native plant equivalents. Some species of native animals on Australia, such as various bird species including Australian magpies, are able to survive as urban wildlife, although introduced birds are more common in the centre of larger cities. Some of the most adaptable small marsupial species, including the Northern brown bandicoot, have also adapted to the urban environment. This being said there are many threats to urban areas in Australia such as habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species (such as cats and Indian mynas), pest species (such as noisy miners), weed propagule pressure, other disturbance, that accompany intensive human land use. If biodiversity is to flourish in urban areas, efforts at the community scale thorough initiatives such as Land for Wildlife and private land conservation, as well as policy and management efforts through restricting land clearing and providing incentives to retain nature in cities is needed. Japan Although culled aggressively in most of Japan for being a pest, the Sika deer is, for religious reasons, protected in the city of Nara and has become part of the urban environment. Due to the denseness of Japanese cities, birdlife is not as common as other parts of the world, though typical urban birds such as crows, sparrows, and gulls have adapted well. Hawaii The urban birdlife of Hawaii is dominated by introduced species, with native species largely remaining only in preserved areas. New Zealand The birdlife in the most urban parts of New Zealand is dominated by introduced species, with bush fragments in the less urbanized areas allowing native species to cohabit. India Rhesus macaques in Agra, northern India In India, the situation is similar to Africa. Monkeys, such as langurs, also enter cities for food, and cause havoc in food markets when they steal fruit from the vendors. In Mumbai, leopards have entered neighbourhoods surrounding the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and killed several people, as the park itself is besieged by a surrounding burgeoning population, where poaching and illegal woodcutting is rife. Europe Many towns in the United Kingdom have Urban Wildlife Groups that work to preserve and encourage urban wildlife. One example is Oxford. =Outside= Urban areas range from fully urban ‚Äì areas having little green space and mostly covered by paving, tarmac, or buildings ‚Äì to suburban areas with gardens and parks. Pigeons are found scavenging on scraps of food left by humans and nesting on buildings, even in the most urban areas, as the tall buildings resemble their natural rocky homes in the mountains. Rats can also be found scavenging on food. Gulls of various types also breed and scavenge in various U.K. cities. A study by the bird biologist Peter Rock, Europe's leading authority on urban gulls, into the rise of herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls in Bristol has discovered that in 20 years the city's colony has grown from about 100 pairs to more than 1,200. From a gull's point of view, buildings are simply cliff-sided islands, with no predators and much nearby food. The trend is the same in places as far apart as Gloucester and Aberdeen. With an endless supply of food, more city chicks survive each year, and become accustomed to urban living. They in turn breed even more birds, with less reason to undertake a winter migration. Waterfowl such as Ducks, Coots, Geese, Swans, and Moorhens thrive in gardens and parks with access to water. Small populations can form around fountains and other ornamental features, far from natural bodies of water, provided there are adequate amounts of food such as aquatic plants growing in the fountain. From a study conducted on Great Tits living in ten European cities and in ten nearby forests. An analysis was made of the way the birds used songs to attract mates and establish territorial boundaries. Hans Slabbekoorn, of Leiden University in the Netherlands, said that city birds adapt to life by singing faster, shorter, and higher-pitch songs in the cities compared to forests. The forest birds sing low and they sing slow. Great Tits living in noisy cities have to compete with the low-frequency sounds of heavy traffic, which means their songs go up in pitch to make themselves heard. A bird that sang like Barry White in the forest sounded more like Michael Jackson in the big city. The advent of these animals has also drawn a predator, as Peregrine falcons have also been known to nest in urban areas, nesting on tall buildings and preying on pigeons. The peregrine falcon is becoming more nocturnal in urban environments, using urban lighting to spot its prey. This has provided them with new opportunities to hunt night-flying birds and bats. Red foxes are also in many urban and suburban areas in the U.K. as scavengers.Foxes They scavenge, and eat insects and small vertebrates such as pigeons and rodents. People also leave food for them to eat in their gardens. One red fox was even found living at the top of the then-partially completed Shard in 2011, having climbed the stairwell to reach its temporary home some 72 stories above ground. In some cases even large animals have been found living in cities. Berlin has wild boars. Wild roe deer are becoming increasingly common in green areas in Scottish towns and cities, such as in the Easterhouse suburb of Glasgow. Urban waterways can also contain wildlife, including large animals. In London, since improvements in water quality in the Thames, seals and porpoises have been seen in its waters in the center of the city . Close proximity to avian life hasn't presented a problem for people in the past, but there are new concerns about the spread of bird flu (the H5N1 virus) via infected migratory birds. Some scientists are worried that persistent human expansion could indirectly lead to a disease pandemic of global proportions. =Inside houses= Numerous animals can also live within buildings. Insects that sometimes inhabit buildings include various species of small beetles such as ladybirds, which often seek refuge inside buildings during the winter months, as well as cockroaches. See also housefly. North America Many North American species have successfully adapted to urban environments and are thriving. Typical examples include coyotes, the top predator of such regions. Other common urban animals include: predators such as red foxes, grey foxes, and bobcats that prey on small animals such as rodents. Omnivores such as raccoons, Virginia opossums, and striped skunks are seldom seen and mainly come out at night; In the south and southeastern United States and Mexico the nine-banded armadillo joins these other omnivores but due to the armadillo's lack of thick fur they are unable to thrive in more northern climates. Squirrels, including the American red squirrel, fox squirrel, and eastern grey squirrel are extremely common in suburbs with enough trees. Herbivores forage in the early morning and evening with cottontail rabbits and in dryer parts of the country jackrabbits as well as the two most common deer species in North America the white tailed deer and the mule deer. Shy of humans, deer are often spotted as a mother with fawns or a lone buck creeping through the trees and bushes. As whitetails prefer forest edge and meadow to actual dense forest, the cutting of forests has actually made more habitat for the white-tailed deer, which has increased its numbers beyond what they were at when Europeans arrived in America. In some cities, older deer seem to have learned how to cross the street, as they look back and forth looking for cars while crossing roads, while fawns and younger deer will recklessly run out without looking; most traffic accidents involving deer happen with deer that have just left their mother, and are less likely to watch for cars. Red-tailed hawks such as Pale Male have been documented nesting and raising chicks in New York City since at least the 1990s. The American alligator, a once-threatened species that was saved from extinction through farming and conservation, can frequently be found living in open areas with access to water, such as golf courses and parks, in its native range. These animals living in urban areas sometimes come into conflict with humans, as some of them will open garbage bags in search of food, eat food left out for pets, prey on unattended pets, feed on prized garden plants, dig up lawns or become traffic hazards when they run out into the road. Coyotes pose a risk to small children, who should not be left unsupervised in areas that coyotes are known to inhabit; they are large enough to easily kill and eat a child, and they lack the fear of humans that most wild canids exhibit. While there are media accounts of alligators being found in sewer pipes and storm drains, most experts think that such 'sewer alligators' are unlikely to sustain a breeding population in such environments, due to a lack of place to bury their eggs. Urban wildlife is often considered a nuisance, with local governments being tasked to manage the issue. In 2009, a large blobby mass made of colonies of tubifex worms was found to be living in the sewers of Raleigh, North Carolina. Revealed by a snake camera inspection of sewer piping under the Cameron Village shopping center, videos of the creature went viral on YouTube in 2009 under the name \\"Carolina poop monster\\". Animals known to dwell within human habitations in the US include house centipedes (Scutigera coleoptrata), and firebrats. South America Marmosets can be found living wild in city parks in Brazil. Urban-dwelling marmosets tend to return more often to the same sleeping sites than jungle-dwelling marmosets. Urban-dwelling marmosets tend to prefer to sleep in tall trees with high first branches and smooth bark. It has been suggested they do this to avoid cats.

This is a 6% drop in numbers from the 2011 census, although the drop could have been because of the poor running of the census leaving many Jews uncomfortable with revealing their religion. There are many estimates of how many Jews are in Australia, with some estimates going as high as 250,000. History In 1830 the first Jewish wedding in Australia was celebrated, the contracting parties being Moses Joseph and Rosetta Nathan. Jewish immigration came at a time of antisemitism and the Returned Services League and other groups publicized cartoons to encourage the government and the immigration Minister Arthur A. Calwell to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants.Rutland, Susan, 2005, The Jews in Australia =Affiliations= The Great Synagogue of Sydney. Until the 1930s, all synagogues in Australia were affiliated with Orthodox, acknowledging leadership of the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom. To this day, about 70% of synagogues in Australia are Orthodox. There had been at least two short-lived efforts to establish Reform congregations, the first as early as the 1890s. However, in 1930, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a Liberal or Progressive congregation, Temple Beth Israel (Melbourne, Australia), was permanently established in Melbourne. In 1938 the long-serving Senior Rabbi, Rabbi Dr Herman Sanger, was instrumental in establishing another synagogue, Temple Emanuel in Sydney. He also played a part in founding a number of other Liberal synagogues in other cities in both Australia and New Zealand. The first Australian-born rabbi, Rabbi Dr John Levi, served the Australian Liberal movement.Rubinstein and Freeman, (Editors), \\"A Time to Keep: The story of Temple Beth Israel: 1930 to 2005\\" A Special publication of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, 2005. These congregations are supported by the Sydney-based Union for Progressive Judaism. Demographics People affiliated with Judaism as a percentage of the total population in Sydney at the 2011 census, divided geographically by postal area A poster of Menachem Mendel Schneerson at the entrance of a Chabad house in Bondi Beach in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. About 90 percent of the Australian Jewish community live in Sydney and Melbourne. Melbourne Ports has the largest Jewish community of any electorate in Australia.http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/2012/12/22/seat-of-the-week- melbourne-ports/ The Jewish Community Council of Victoria has estimated that 60,000 Australian Jews live in Victoria. In Frankston, the Jewish community has nearly doubled since 2007. In Adelaide Australian Jews have been present throughout the history of the city, with many successful civic leaders and people in the arts.Adelaide Jewish Museum Retrieved 8 September 2011. According to the , the Jewish population numbered 91,020 individuals, of whom 46% lived in Greater Melbourne, 39% in Greater Sydney, and 6% in Greater Perth. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Jews are Victoria (0.71%) and New South Wales (0.49%), whereas those with the lowest are the Northern Territory and Tasmania (both 0.05%). The same social and cultural characteristics of Australia that facilitated the extraordinary economic, political, and social success of the Australian Jewish community have also been attributed to contributing to widespread assimilation. Community success can also be measured by the vibrancy of Australian Jewish Media. While traditional Jewish print media is in decline, new media forms such as podcasts, online magazines, and blogs have stepped into the breach.http://macroscope.com.au People =Academics= *Roy Clive Abraham, linguist *Bernhard Neumann, German-born British-Australian mathematician *Peter Singer, philosopher *Ghil'ad Zuckermann, linguist and revivalist =Artists and entertainers= *Lior Attar, singer, musician *Danny Ben-Moshe, writer *John Bluthal, actor *Saskia Burmeister, actress *Isla Fisher, actress *Amelia Frid, Russian-born actress *Renee Geyer, soul singer *David Helfgott, pianist (inspired Academy Award-winning film Shine) *Barrie Kosky, opera director *Ben Lee, singer, songwriter and actor *David Malouf, writer *Miriam Margolyes, British-Australian actress *Leon Pole, artist *Ohad Rain, Australian-born Israeli singer-songwriter *John Safran, comedian *Troye Sivan, South African-born Australian singer, actor and YouTuber *Elana Stone, musician *Yael Stone, actress *Felix Werder, German born *Yitzhak Yedid, Israeli born composer =Business people= *Alan Finkel, Australia's Chief Scientist *John Gandel, businessman, philanthropist *David Gonski, businessman, philanthropist *Solomon Lew, businessman *Frank Lowy, Slovak-born Israeli Australian businessman *Anthony Pratt, Australian businessman *Richard Pratt, businessman *Sheree Rubinstein, entrepreneur, women's business leader and advocate *Sidney Sinclair, businessman *Victor Smorgon, businessman *Harry Triguboff, Chinese-born Australian businessman *Alex Waislitz, businessman =Legal system= *James Edelman, High Court Justice *Louis Waller, Legal academic and head of Monash law faculty =Politicians= *Hajnal Ban Black, Israeli born author, politician *Josh Burns, member for Macnamara *Sir Zelman Cowen, politician, Governor-General of Australia *Michael Danby, member for Melbourne Ports *Mark Dreyfus, former attorney general *Josh Frydenberg politician and deputy leader of the Liberal party *Sir Isaac Isaacs, Judge and politician, Chief Justice of Australia, and Governor-General of Australia *Henry Ninio, Egyptian-born Lord Mayor of Adelaide *Martin Pakula, politician *Kerryn Phelps, president of the AMA and independent member for Wentworth *Mark Regev, Australian-born Israeli diplomat and civil servant *David Southwick, politician =Rabbis= *Raymond Apple, Senior Rabbi of the Great Synagogue of Sydney *David Bar-Hayim, born David Mandel, head of the Machon Shilo in Israel *Eliezer Berkovits, leading rabbinic philosopher, served as a rabbi in Sydney 1946-50 *Israel Brodie, Chief Rabbi of the Commonwealth, served as a rabbi in Australia 1923-37 *Harry Freedman, rabbi, author and translator *Yitzchok Dovid Groner, head of the Yeshiva Centre in Melbourne, implicated in coverups of child sex abuse *Chaim Gutnick, first head of the Rabbinical Council of Victoria *Meir Shlomo Kluwgant, senior rabbi in Melbourne, implicated in coverups of child sex abuse *John Levi, Rabbi *Karen Soria, Reform rabbi, first woman to serve as a rabbi in Australia *Yehiel Grenimann (formerly John Green of Melbourne),Masorti (Conservative), Jerusalem, author, human rights activist =Sportspeople= *Ashley Brown, soccer player *Jordan Brown, soccer player *Gavin Fingleson, Olympic silver medalist baseball player *Jessica Fox, canoeist, Olympic silver medalist *Noemie Fox, canoeist *Todd Goldstein, AFL Player for the North Melbourne Kangaroos *Todd Greenberg, former NRL executive *Michael Klinger, cricketer *Jonathan Moss, former first-class cricketer for the Victoria cricket team (2000 - 2007).

It was established under the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act (2008) and the Public Transport Regulation Act (2009), on 1 December 2009.Part 2 of this Act having been brought into operation by S.I. 459 of 2009, the Dublin Transport Authority (Part 2) (Establishment Day) Order 2009. The NTA took over certain functions from the Department of Transport and the entire role of the Dublin Transportation Office. It has also taken over the functions of the Commission for Taxi Regulation when Part 4 of the Public Transport Regulation Act (2009) commenced on 1 January 2011. The NTA operates under the consumer facing brand Transport for Ireland. Organisation The act establishing the NTA made it a body corporate consisting of the City Manager of Dublin City Council, the Chief Executive and a member of the senior management team, and a chairman and six other members appointed by the Minister for Transport. The NTA has charge of public transport in the Greater Dublin Area, which is defined legally for the first time in the Act. The counties covered are the City of Dublin, D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown, South Dublin, Fingal, County Wicklow. County Kildare, and County Meath. An advisory council, consisting of local government officials and councillors, representatives of the Garda S√≠och√°na, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and business and community interests, was also established. The Public Transport Regulation Act retains this structure, though it provides that its functional area in respect of the additional functions that it is granted under that Bill its functional area is the entire state. The NTA subsumed the activities of the former Dublin Transportation Office, which was dissolved on 1 December 2009. John Fitzgerald is chairperson of the NTA, and Anne Graham is chief executive officer.http://www.nationaltransport.ie/news/new-ceo-appointed-to-national- transport-authority/ Services The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently in charge of most public transport within Greater Dublin. Unlike authorities such as Transport for London and RATP it does not normally operate services itself, although there is provision for it to do so in certain circumstances. It operates public service obligation contracts with transport operators, including C√≥ras Iompair √âireann, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and private operators. It was originally intended that the Railway Procurement Agency would, like the Dublin Transportation Office, be subsumed into the NTA, but a lobbying campaign by the Agency led to it retaining its separate status. The CI√â companies (Dublin Bus, Iarnr√≥d √âireann and Bus √âireann) have retained their existing services, but they are now subject to directions from the NTA within Greater Dublin. In 2011 the NTA oversaw the development of the currently Leap card scheme which introduced integrated ticketing in the Greater Dublin Area. During 2012 and 2013 a major rebranding of services took place on taxis all over Ireland, and on some of the fleet in both Dublin Bus and Bus √âireann, using the new name Transport for Ireland. This rebranding is to continue over the coming years.http://www.independent.ie/national- news/dublin-bus-feeling-offcolour-yet-again-1353864.html On 6 December 2013 the NTA announced that around 10% of routes currently operated by Dublin Bus and Bus √âireann under their direct award contracts would be subject to competitive tendering, with a view to services commencing in 2016.http://www.nationaltransport.ie/news/bus-routes-for-open-tender- announced/ In December 2013 the NTA published a plan for an extensive cycle network in Greater Dublin, with greenways, cycleways and cycle paths which would make all of the city and its surrounds accessible by bicycle ‚Äì the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network. The planned network has not, so far, been built.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/publications/transport-planning/gda- cycle-network-plan/ Establishment timeline The name of the body, under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, was originally to be \\"Dublin Transport Authority\\". However, in the brought-forward Budget announced in October 2008, the Government announced a major review of public service bodies, with bodies being amalgamated where it was felt savings could be made. A separate national transport regulator was originally intended to be set up to licence public transport, but an annex to Budget 2009 revealed that the Government intended to incorporate both this body and the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the DTA. In an interview in The Irish Times on 14 January 2009, the Minister for Transport at the time, Noel Dempsey, confirmed this would indeed be the case. In January 2009, the Public Appointments Service advertised the position of chief executive officer of the DTA.http://www.publicjobs.ie/cand/JobDetails_eng.asp?JobID=3868&hdnGUID;=&hdnJobID;=2452&sgDest;=JOBLISTING The advertisement noted the Government's intention to \\"assign national responsibility to the DTA for bus market regulation and the procurement of public transport services under public service obligations\\" and for the DTA to take over the duties of the Commission for Taxi Regulation. In September 2009, former Dublin city manager John Fitzgerald was appointed chairman designate of the NTA, with Gerry Murphy appointed chief executive designate.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2009/0902/1224253656950.html Also in September 2009, the Public Transport Regulation Bill (2009) was published. This gave it responsibility for licensing road passenger transport services throughout the State. It also provided for the abolition of the Taxi Regulator and the transfer of its functions to the renamed National Transport Authority. This is in addition to its Dublin-specific functions granted under the DTA Act, which it retained. In October 2009, the Minister announced that the Commission for Aviation Regulation would be merged with the new authority, with certain functions of the Irish Aviation Authority also to be transferred. However, neither of these proposals actually made it into the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, which was promulgated on 27 November 2009.http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=24‚ü®=eng The Public Transport Regulation Act (2009) proposed to change the name of the organisation to the National Transport Authority.http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2009/5909/B5909S.pdf and this was done with effect from the establishment day of the Authority under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 (National Transport Authority) (Appointed Day) Order 2009, References External links *The Seanad √âireann Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 *Official site ‚Äì National Transport Authority *Official site ‚Äì Transport for Ireland *Official site ‚Äì Dublin Bus *Official site ‚Äì Iarnr√≥d √âireann *Official site ‚Äì Luas *Official site ‚Äì RPA Category:C√≥ras Iompair √âireann Category:Bus transport in the Republic of Ireland Category:Transport companies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Transport in County Dublin Category:Local government in County Dublin ","title":"National Transport Authority (Ireland)"},{"id":"17404603","text":"A wet woodland in Firebeacon, Devon A wet woodland is a type of plant community.

He was given a full scholarship for soccer by Chris Bartels, the head coach of the University of Memphis, at that time called Memphis State University. Soccer After a year at the University of Memphis and starting at times as a freshman, he dropped out to pursue his dream of being a professional soccer player.

In 2000, DeVall was called up by the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.Can Mosen find new Rhythm? DeVall played 30 minutes of his first MLS game against the Columbus Crew. He then started and played 80 minutes of his next game for the Colorado Rapids at a home game in Denver, Colorado. DeVall was offered the league minimum, $24,000 per year, by head coach Glenn Myernick. DeVall turned down the offer as he was making more than double the money in Nashville playing for the Metros and working as a mortgage broker for People‚Äôs Home Equity. In 2001, the Rhythm returned to Nashville, regaining the Metros name. It also dropped from the USL A-League to the fourth division Premier Development League. DeVall played for the Metros until officially retiring in 2008, holding the team record in games played. DeVall is one of only two players inducted into the Nashville Metros Hall of Fame.NASHVILLE METROS RECORD BOOK References External links * 2008 Nashville Metros * Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:American soccer players Category:Soccer players from Tennessee Category:USISL players Category:Memphis Tigers men's soccer players Category:Memphis Jackals players Category:Nashville Metros players Category:Tennessee Rhythm players Category:Colorado Rapids players Category:USL League Two players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Danny DeVall"},{"id":"17404652","text":"Asian Economic Papers is a peer-reviewed academic journal that focuses on the analysis of economic issues in Asia.

It shares studios with sister WFRL at 834 North Tower Road, northeast of Freeport. Their transmitter site is west of town, on Highway 20. History WFPS signed on the air on November 1, 1970 under the caller letters of WACI with an effective radiated power of 3,000 watts. The station was started by Ruth and F.X. Mahoney. The studios were in a double wide trailer custom designed for a radio station located on highway 20, five miles west of Freeport, IL. Its format was easy listening music. The staff consisted of Ruth Mahoney, Dick Carroll, Al Newman, Lee Newman, Lee Jackson, Mike Dierdorf, Barb Cremer, John Shepler, Jim Runkle, Helen Hawkins, Bob Spencer, John Byers and Sherwin Williams (not the paint guy). In the summer of 1972 WACI was sold to Bob Barry and Bill James from Milwaukee. Bob was the morning DJ on WOKY. When the sale of the station was approved the format changed to a top 40 format. The station sounded very much like WOKY. Among the DJ's were Joe Benson, Scott Bell, Jay Allan Reese, John Q, Mike Raub, Chris O'Brian and others. Joe Benson went on to bigger and better jobs as a DJ after leaving WACI in the summer of 1974. He worked at several stations in the Milwaukee, WI market and eventually ended up in Los Angeles and was formerly the mid-day DJ on 100.3 The Sound KSWD and is the host of the national syndicated show \\"Off The Record\\". When Bill James died in 1973 the station was sold to P.J. Broderick with another silent partner. The station continued with its Top 40 format until the station was sold to Dick Weis in December 1981. Dick Weis did not like the connotation \\"WACKY\\" so the caller letters were changed to WFPS and the format changed to an Adult Contemporary format in the fall of 1982. WFPS changed its format to an oldies format in May 1987. Milwaukee radio legend Pat Shanahan worked at the station in the 80's. Dick Weis owned the station until he became the mayor of Freeport, Illinois. In the spring of 1989 the station was again sold to a group of 4 investors (Friends Communications). The four investors included Chuck Brooks, a radio sales representative from Chicago; his brother, Mick Brooks, a dentist from Youngstown, Ohio, Bob Elliot, a radio consultant from Atlanta, and Robert Guererro, a real estate developer from New Jersey. Despite having no previous experience in the radio industry, Mick Brooks served as the station's General manager. The format switched back to Adult Contemporary with the change of ownership. The move backfired as Brooks struggled with staffing issues and financial problems and alienated many of the locals. On the 25th anniversary of the station (November 1, 1995) the station was again sold to Chuck Mills, an investor from Wisconsin. He held on to the station for 6 months before an offer was presented to him which he could not turn down. The station was again sold in the summer of 1996 to Mike Weckerly. Shortly after Mike Weckerly purchased WFPS, he moved the station out of the trailer it had been broadcasting from for 26 years into a real building that also housed WFRL on Tower Road. It was in August 1996 when WFPS got its first taste of digital automation using Scott Studios. Mike sold the stations in May 1998 to a corporate group from Rockford, IL (Radio Works). The station switched from its Adult Contemporary format to Country Legends in May 2001. In 2005 Radio Works sold its stations in Rockford and Freeport to Maverick Media. On June 1, 2006 the FCC approved the sale of WFPS (and WFRL) from Maverick Media to Green County Broadcasting which also owns WQLF (Lena, IL) and WEKZ AM & FM (Monroe, WI). The current format of WFPS is new Country.

Her previous novel, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, and Peony in Love emphasize the difficulty 19th- and 17th-century Chinese women had in achieving freedom and identity in a society that was both male dominated and rigid in its gender expectations. Plot summary Peony's father, a wealthy, cultured man with important political contacts, is planning a performance of The Peony Pavilion on his estate. This is seen by many as controversial because the opera may influence young women into imitating Liniang, starving themselves to death in hopes of finding love. Unfortunately, this is just what happens to Peony. She is deeply moved by the text and performance of The Peony Pavilion, having extensively written about her feelings and reactions to love in her copy of the text. On the evening of the opera performance, Peony accidentally meets a handsome young man. After three nighttime meetings, Peony falls in love, but she also falls into deep despair, feeling doomed because of being trapped in an arranged marriage. Following the example of Du Liniang, she starves herself to death, only to learn right before her death that the man her father has picked for her is Wu Ren, the man she loves. Most of Peony in Love takes place after Peony's death. Because her funeral rituals are not concluded properly, she becomes a \\"hungry ghost\\", who wanders far beyond the inner world of women that constrained her in her youth. In the process, she encounters a number of women writers who lament the difficulty of getting their voices heard in a male- dominated world. From her dead grandmother, she learns many painful details about her family's past as the Qing Dynasty violently replaced the Ming Dynasty, details later amplified by Peony's mother. Peony comes to learn about the courage and extreme suffering both older women experienced during the fighting and that the sternness her mother treated her with as a girl was only her attempt to protect her daughter from the evils of the outside world. Peony shows her enduring love for Ren by her influence on his second wife, although she later realizes that she may have gone too far and actually harmed the girl. Feeling guilty, she puts herself in self-exile, wandering around Hangzhou, until her mother convinces her to go back and make it up for Ren and his second wife. Peony chooses a young and neglected girl to \\"guide\\" and, influencing the girl's mother, she slowly molds her into a lovely lady. Ren, a lonely widower, marries the girl as his third wife. After years have past, the third wife starts reading Peony's and the second wife's writings, and after adding on to them she convinces her husband to help her publish them. Not long after Ren realizes that Peony was never given the appropriate funeral rites and finally completes them for her. Peony is no longer a hungry ghost but a spirit who looks forward with great joy to meeting her husband again in the afterworld. Background In Peony in Love, the opera The Peony Pavilion by Tang Xianzu, The Three Wives' Commentary on The Peony Pavilion, and the theme of love all play important roles. Of the latter, See has said: \\"I wanted to explore different aspects of love: gratitude love, pity love, respectful love, romantic love, sexual love, sacrificing love, duty love, and finally mother love\\".\\"A Conversation with Lisa See\\", Random House Reader's Circle. See also stated that The Three Wives' Commentary had a special influence on her as she researched the large amount of writing done by Chinese women in the 17th century, most of it largely unknown today. \\"Then I came across The Three Wives' Commentary -- the first book of its kind to have been published anywhere in the world to have been written by women -- three wives, no less. With that, my interest turned into an obsession\\". The three wives of Wu Ren in the novel‚ÄîChen Tong (Peony), Tan Ze, and Qian Yi were, in fact, the real women who wrote The Three Wives' Commentary. The opera presents the love of Du Liniang for a young man, Liu Mengmei, whom she meets in a dream. Unable to turn her dream into reality, Liniang wastes away and dies, haunting Lui as a ghost. Eventually he finds a way to bring Liniang back to life, allowing them to find ultimate happiness.

He served as professor of pathology at several U.S. medical schools and as Dean of the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri). Early life Opie was born in Staunton, Virginia, on July 5, 1873. His father, Thomas, was an obstetrician-gynecologist, and one of the founders and deans of the University of Maryland College of Medicine in Baltimore. Eugene attended Johns Hopkins University, both as an undergraduate and a medical student. He received an A.B. degree in 1893, and was in the first graduating class of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, earning the M.D. degree in 1897. The first medical school graduating class of Johns Hopkins University, 1897. Opie is second from the left in the back row. Under the tutelage of the pathologist William H. Welch, Opie developed a special affinity for tissue pathology. As a medical student, he observed consistent morphological alterations in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans in patients with diabetes mellitusan observational epiphany that shed light on the pathogenesis of that disease. Opie stayed on at Johns Hopkins after completing medical school, to receive additional training in pathology from Welch. He continued his work on pancreatic diseases, establishing the relationship between obstruction of the ampulla of Vater (e.g., by gallstones) and the subsequent development of acute pancreatitis. In 1904, Opie moved to New York City to work at the Rockefeller Institute, with a focus on the enzymatic constituents of leukocytes and their role in inflammatory conditions. He concurrently served as a \\"visiting\\" pathologist at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, and was named an editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology.Op cit. Ref. 2 Washington University (St. Louis) In 1910, Opie was appointed Chair of Pathology at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in St. Louis. He served as Dean of the school from 1912 to 1915, presiding over a significant expansion of its physical facilities, scientific mission, and curriculum.  Military service  When the United States entered World War I, Opie took a leave of absence from WUSM to enter the U.S. Army. He served in France as a colonel (O6) in the Medical Corps, with special work on infectious diseases and their prevention among allied soldiers. Significant new data were accrued on influenza, tuberculosis, and \\"trench fever\\" (bartonellosis) during that time. Upon returning to civilian life, Opie continued his duties at WUSM until 1923. Research on tuberculosis Opie narrowed his general interest in infectious disease to focus on tuberculosis, an international scourge in the early part of the 20th century. In 1923 he became the Director of the Phipps Institute for the Study and Treatment of Tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. A concomitant appointment as Professor of Pathology was also given to him. Through Opie's work over the next decade, much was learned about the modes of tuberculous infection in children and adults, as well as aspects of immunity, hypersensitivity, and cellular defenses regarding that disease. Opie moved to Cornell University Medical Center in New York in 1932 to continue his research. There, as chair of the Pathology department, he recruited several young pathologists‚Äîincluding Robert A. Moore, D. Murray Angevine, Jules Freund, and otherswho would all go on to distinguish themselves as renowned investigators in their own rights. Like Opie, Moore also served as chair of pathology and dean of the medical school at Washington University in the 1940s and 1950s. Retirement Opie retired from full-time professional work in pathology in 1941, although that was not the end of his scientific endeavors. He again worked at the Rockefeller Institute as a \\"guest investigator\\" for the next 28 years. Peer-reviewed manuscripts bore his name as an author until 1970. In addition to infections, Opie did work on hepatic carcinogenesis, alterations in nucleic acid content in various disease states, and tissue fluid flux. Honors Opie served as the president of the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists; the American Society for Experimental Pathology, the National Tuberculosis Association; the American Association of Immunologists; and the Harvey Society. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Yale University, Rockefeller University, and Washington University. Other accolades included the Weber-Parks Medal, the 1959 Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the 1960 Academy Medal for Distinguished Contributions in Biomedical Science from the New York Academy of Medicine, and the T. Duckett Jones Award. Personal life Opie first married Gertrude Lovat Simpson on August 6, 1902, and had four children with her: Thomas Lindsay, Anne Lovat, Helen Lovat and Gertrude Eugenie.

Originally built for the offices of the District of Columbia district government, the District's City Hall was subsequently used as a Federal courthouse, and was the scene of several notable criminal trials including those of three accused presidential assassins. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It now houses the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. History The government of the District of Columbia held a competition for the design of a new district building in 1818. George Hadfield, who had supervised construction of the United States Capitol from October 1795 to May 1798, submitted a design for a new district building, but it was judged to be too costly. Hadfield eventually won the competition in 1820 with a revised version of his original plan, and construction began in August. The offices of the district government moved into the building in 1822. However, a lack of funds and other problems hindered construction and the building would not be completed in its entirety until 1849. According to the NRHP nomination for the adjacent, compatibly-designed United States Court of Military Appeals Building (1910), the district building's south side plan is attributed to George Hadfield, but the north side plan is attributed to Robert Mills. with To raise funds needed to finish the building, the district leased out space during construction to other federal government offices. Tenants included the U.S. Circuit Court and the Recorder of Deeds office, then headed by noted black leader and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, (1818‚Äì1895), who also later served as U.S. Marshal for the District. Following passage of the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, the Old City Hall was used to process payments to slaveholders. The federal government rented additional space in 1863 during the American Civil War and later purchased the building from the District government to house the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. In 1868, a statue of 16th President Abraham Lincoln sculpted by Lot Flannery was erected on the south side of the building, which became the first public monument in his honor. The offices of the District of Columbia government moved to the new District Building in 1908 and the Old City Hall was left to house the federal courts until they vacated the property in 1910. In 1916, Congress approved funds for a complete building renovation. The building was stripped to its brick framing, and the stucco exterior was replaced with limestone blocks on a granite base. The building was rededicated as the U.S. Courthouse in 1922. The federal courts moved to the new E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in 1952 and the Old City Hall eventually became the headquarters of the U.S. Selective Service System. The building was named a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and was returned to the District government two years later for use by the local courts. Prominent cases Many famous cases were tried at the city hall while it was a U.S. courthouse. Former Tennessee Governor and then Cherokee representative Sam Houston, was tried and convicted for assaulting a member of Congress (Ohio Rep. William Stanbery) after Stanbery slandered Houston in a speech on the House of Representatives floor in 1832. Richard Lawrence, the failed assassin of 7th President Andrew Jackson, (the first assassination attempt against an American chief executive) was tried on the site in 1835 under District of Columbia prosecuting attorney Francis Scott Key, (1779‚Äì1843), and was sentenced to a mental institution. The building was also the site of the 1867 trial of John Surratt, an alleged conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln who was later acquitted. However, Charles J. Guiteau, the assassin of President James A. Garfield, was convicted at the courthouse in 1882. The Old City Hall was the scene of a fugitive slave trial known as the \\"Pearl incident,\\" which was the largest single escape by slaves attempted in U.S. history. Two men were convicted in 1848 of attempting to free more than 70 slaves by sailing them from Washington, D.C. down the Potomac River then up the Chesapeake Bay. Current use In 1999, the building closed for an extensive renovation by the architecture firm of Beyer Blinder Belle. Steel framing replaced the old masonry while leaving the stone fa√ßade intact. A new glass atrium was constructed on the north side of the building facing Judiciary Square and is now the main entrance, as had been originally intended. The District of Columbia Courthouse was rededicated on June 17, 2009 as the home of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment, or sheer ignorance of circumstances.\\" Uses The term is widely used by systems theorists. It is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate, or promote it. From a cybernetic perspective complex systems are not controllable by simple notions of management, and interventions in a system can best be understood by looking at how they affect observed system behavior. When \\"side effects\\" or \\"unintended consequences\\" reveal that system behavior is poorly understood, then taking the POSIWID perspective allows the more political understandings of system behavior to be balanced by a more straightforwardly descriptive view.

He was the founder of the German Faith Movement. Biography Initially trained in the family trade as a plasterer, he entered the missionary school at Basel in 1900 and served as a missionary in British India from 1907 to 1911. His time in India and his study of indigenous religions saw him lose faith in Christianity and instead he returned to his studies, reading religious studies and Sanskrit at a doctorate level at the University of Oxford and the University of T√ºbingen, before going on to teach at the University of Marburg (1925) and T√ºbingen itself (1927). Under his tutelage religious studies at T√ºbingen became increasingly close to Nazism and by 1940 he was heading up an 'Aryan Seminar'.The Study of Religion under the Impact of National Socialism In 1920 he formed the Bund der K√∂ngener, a youth movement that grew out of groups of Protestant Bible circles who had come into contact with the Wandervogel tendency. Initially little more than a more organized version of the Wandervogel, the Bund, which was for a time led by Rudolf Otto, became attracted to the ideals of the V√∂lkisch movement, especially as Hauer began to move more towards developing his own religion.Hans-Christian Brandenburg & Rudolf Daur, Die Br√ºcke zu K√∂ngen. F√ºnfzig Jahre Bund der K√∂ngener, Stuttgart, 1970 Hauer began to look into his own forms of religion in 1927 when he set up the Religi√∂ser Menschheitsbund, which aimed for a greater unity amongst Germany's faiths towards common goals. He joined with Ernst Graf zu Reventlow in this endeavour and in 1934 founded the German Faith Movement (Deutsche Glaubensbewegung), which combined a number of existing communities in a V√∂lkisch faith influenced by Hinduism. Hauer's admiration for Hinduism centred on the Bhagavad Gita, to which he had been particularly drawn. He described it as \\"a work of imperishable significance\\", arguing that it called on people to \\"master the riddle of life\\". By July 1934 the religion had been ratified as Hauer celebrated his first wedding without other clergy.Pagans and Gags from Time It had initially been hoped that it might be adopted as the state religion of the Third Reich but this did not happen and as it began to decline Hauer left in 1936. Hauer remained close to the Nazis however. He became a member of the NSDAP in 1937 and liked to portray the German Faith Movement as the true religious expression of Nazism. He expected members of the movement to work together with Catholics and Protestants.C.P. Blamires, World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 299 He wrote to Heinrich Himmler immediately after Rudolf Hess' flight to Scotland, denouncing Hess for his supposed adherence to anthroposophy, an esoteric philosophy which Hauer felt was at odds with his own occult vision.Uwe Werner, Was Rudolf Hess an Anthroposophist? In later years Hauer would seek not only to distance himself from the Nazis but also to portray himself as an anthroposophist. In 1935, however, he wrote that: > every undertaking and activity of anthroposophy necessarily arises out of > the Anthroposophical world view. The anthroposophical world view is in the > most important points directly opposed to National Socialism. Therefore, > schools which are built out of the anthroposophical world view and led by > anthroposophists mean danger to true German education.Uwe Werner, > Anthroposophy in the Time of Nazi Germany Hauer was removed from his university position after World War II and was interned from 1945 to 1949. He continued to agitate for his own religion, forming the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr freie Religionsforschung und Philosophie in 1947 and the Freie Akademie in 1955.

Background At the early period in question, oral tradition may have sufficed to hand down a certain number of musical formulas. When, later on, the ecclesiastical chants had been co- ordinated, it was found necessary to provide them with a notation. The attribution to Pope Gregory I (590-604) of an official codification of the collection of antiphons occurring in the Divine Office has at frequent intervals, exercised the wit of the learned. At the end of the ninth century John the Deacon (d. c. 882) ascribed to Gregory I the compilation of the books of music used by the schola cantorum established at Rome, by that pope. Attribution controversy The statement, formal as it was, left room for discussion. Goussainville was the first to express (1685) a doubt as to the authenticity of the Gregorian antiphonary. He was followed by Ellies du Pin, by Dom Denys de Sainte Marthe, and by Casimir Oudin, who added nothing noteworthy to the arguments of Goussainville. In 1729, J. Georges d'Eckhart suggested Pope Gregory II (715-731) as the author of a work which tradition had for centuries ascribed to Gregory I; his arguments were more or less trivial. In 1749, Dominic Georgi took up the defence of the traditional opinion; among other arguments he brought forward a text whose full bearing on the point at issue he hardly seems to have grasped. This was a text of Egbert of York which Georgi transferred to the end of his book, in the form of a note, so that it was neither seen nor made use of. When, three years later, Vezzozi again took up the question, he also overlooked this particular text, and voluntarily deprived himself of an important argument in favour of the authorship of Gregory I. In 1772 Gallicioli followed in the footsteps of Vezzozi, but renewed the latter's concessions to the adversaries of Gregory I, nor did he make any secret of his surprise at the silence of Gregory of Tours, Isidore of Seville, and Bede, concerning that pope's liturgical and musical labours. Being only partially convinced, he refrained from any conclusion, and left the matter undecided. It was reopened by Martin Gerbert in 1774, and by Zaccarin in 1781, the latter of whom at last lit upon the text of Egbert. Between 1781 and 1890 no one seems to have discussed, critically, the ascription of the antiphonary to any particular pope. Indeed, the question was supposed to have been settled by the discovery of the antiphonary itself, which was said to be none other than the St. Gall manuscript 359 of the ninth or tenth century, containing an antiphonary between pages 24 and 158. This illusion passed through various phases from 1837 to 1848, when Danjou, in his turn, discovered the Gregorian antiphonary in a Montpellier manuscript of the tenth or eleventh century. In 1851 the Jesuit Lambillotte published a facsimile of the St. Gall manuscript, but the Gregorian question made no real progress. The discussion concerning the antiphonary was suddenly revived, in 1890, by a public lecture delivered before the Belgian Academy on 27 October, 1899, by Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert. His argument has been summarized by Dom Morin: :\\"The productive period of church musical art extends from the pontificate of St. Celestine (422-432) to about the year 700, and is divided into two epochs. That of simple chant, the latest development of Gr√¶co-Roman music, includes the last years of the Western Empire, and the whole duration of the Gothic kingdom (425-563). The second, that of ornate chant, coincides with the preponderance at Rome of Byzantine policy and art. We meet with only one name, throughout the latter epoch, with which the creation of the Roman antiphonary seems to be connected; it is to Sergius I (687-701) that the honour belongs not only of having put the last touch to the Roman liturgical collections, but also of having recast all the ancient chants in accordance with a uniform melodic style, in harmony with the tendencies and tastes of the Byzantine influence. Finally, it was most probably the Syrian, Gregory III (731-741), the last but one of the Greek popes, who co-ordinated and united all the chants of the Mass in a collection similar to that which his predecessor, Agatho, had caused to be compiled for the anthems of the Day- Hours. As to the first Gregory, no evidence prior to that of John the Deacon alludes to the part ascribed to him. But there is evidence for the popes of Greek origin who lived at the end of the eighth century, notably for Agatho and Leo II. Indeed, in respect of the chant of the Church, it is very probable that the great pope took no immediate interest in this part of divine worship; much less do the antiphonary and the sacramentary which bear his name agree in any way with the ecclesiastical calendar of St. Gregory's time; if they are at all rightly called Gregorian, it must be in reference either to Gregory II (715-731) or, more probably, to his successor, Gregory III, who died in 741.\\" This theory called forth many refutations. Dom G. Morin set himself to prove that the traditional ascription was well founded. To this end he drew up, in chronological order, a kind of catena of the historical texts on which the tradition rested. In addition to the statement of John the Deacon, he brought forward that of Walafrid Strabo (d. 840), whose meaning is perfectly clear. These texts, however, are of a late date. The previously mentioned text of Egbert, Bishop of York (732-766), is nearly a hundred years earlier. In his dialogue entitled De institutione ecclesiastic√¢, and in a sermon for the second fast of the fourth month, Egbert formally ascribes the composition of both the antiphonary and the sacramentary to Gregory, the author of the conversion of England: noster didascalus beatus Gregorius. At a somewhat earlier period, Aldhelm of Sherburne (d. 709) also bore witness to St. Gregory's authorship of the sacramentary, but said nothing concerning the antiphonary. In another essay Dom Morin reviewed critically all the texts relating to the antiphonary known as Gregorian. Though mostly of a late date, they owe to their mutual agreement an appreciable historical value. There are, however, other and more ancient texts, which, it would seem, ought to close the controversy. Dom Morin's catena seems to end with Egbert, between whom and St. Gregory I there was an interval of at least one hundred and ten years. The silence, as it proved, was less complete than had been supposed. In the very year (732) that Egbert was raised to the See of York another prelate, Acca of Hexham, was forced to resign the office which he had held since 709. Bede appears to have been one of Egbert's friends from that time onward, which enables him to inform us (H. E., V, 20) that Acca had learned the ecclesiastical chant from a certain Maban, who had acquired it, himself, while living in Kent, from the successors of the disciples of the Pope Gregory. Acca had, in fact, spent twelve years in Maban's school. If we take 732 as the last of these twelve years, it follows that the first lessons given by Maban go back to the year 720, at which date Maban had had time to be trained by the successors of the disciples of Pope Gregory. Gregory II became pope in 715; a space of five years is, evidently, not easy to reconcile with the plain meaning of what Bede says. It seems, therefore, as though these words of Bede were equivalent to an early Anglo-Saxon ascription of the ecclesiastical chant to Pope Gregory I. Speaking of Putta, Bishop of Rochester (669-676), the same historian says (H. E., IV, 2): :\\"He was above all things skilful in the art of singing in church according to the Roman fashion, which he had learned from the disciples of the Blessed Pope Gregory\\". There can be no doubt in this case, nor can anyone but Gregory I be meant. Does it follow that St. Gregory was, as John the Deacon says, the compiler of the antiphonary? There are, at least, good reasons for thinking so. One last argument may be cited on his behalf. The series of antiphons in the antiphonary, intended to be sung at the Communion during Lent, are for the most part taken from the Book of Psalms. Their order reveals the idea that governed the choice of them. With certain exceptions, to be referred to presently, the antiphons follow one another in the numerical order of the Psalms from which they are drawn. The series thus obtained begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on the Friday in Passion Week, forming a regular succession of Psalms from 1 to 26, except for the interruptions caused (1) by intercalations and (2) by lacun√¶. These intercalations affect (1) the five Sundays, (2) the six Thursdays, (3) the Saturday following Ash Wednesday. The exclusion of the Sundays is explained by the adoption of a ferial, or week-day, sequence; that of the Thursdays by the simple observation that the Thursdays were not included in the liturgical system for Lent at the period when Psalms 1 to 26 were divided between the other days of the week. We learn from the Liber Pontificalis that it was Gregory II who introduced the Thursday of each week into the liturgical system of Lenten Masses. Now it proves to be these very Thursdays which interrupt the order that the remaining days of the week would otherwise show. No more precise and decisive accumulation of proof could possibly be wished for. We thus grasp the chronological element at the moment of its interpolation into the very heart of the antiphonary. Gregory II ‚Äî therefore still less Gregory III ‚Äî is not the original author of the compilation whereon he has left his mark by misunderstanding the principle which governed its original formation. The musical compilation known as the antiphonary is therefore not due to Gregory II, nor is it from him that it has become known as the Gregorian antiphonary. Its existence prior to his time is proved by the intercalation of the Thursdays which interrupt the continuity of an harmonious arrangement, to which Gregory II paid no attention, though possibly he may rather have wished to respect it as a work thenceforward irreformable, as a traditional deposit which he refused to disturb and re-order. It is not easy to say, or even to convey an idea of, what this primitive edition of the antiphonary may have contained; but there can be no doubt that it contained in their actual order the Lenten communion-antiphons, and is certainly anterior to Gregory III and to Gregory II. This fact alone proves the existence of an antiphonal collection, known as the Gregorian antiphonary, prior to the time of Pope Gregory II.

Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes (Springer Japan, Tokyo), pp 15‚Äì30. The main function of UGGT is to recognize misfolded glycoproteins and transfer a glucose (Glc) monomer (monoglucosylate) to the terminal mannose of the A-branch of the glycan on the glycoprotein. It uses UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as the glucosyl donor and requires calcium ions for its activity: misfolded-glycoprotein-Asn-GlcNAc2Man9 + UDP-Glc => misfolded- glycoprotein-Asn-GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 + UDP UGGT is about 170 kDa and it consists of two structurally independent portions: a variable N-terminal portion of ~1200 amino acids, which in turn comprises 4 thioredoxin-like domains and two beta-sandwich domains, and senses glycoprotein misfolding; and a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic portion of ~300 amino acids, folding as a glucosyltransferase domain belonging to fold family GT24. Higher eukaryotes possess two isoforms, UGGT1 and UGGT2, but only the former has been conclusively shown to be active in misfolded glycoprotein recognition. UGGT is part of the ER quality control system of glycoprotein folding and its activity increases the potential for correctly folded glycoproteins.Dejgaard, S.; Nicolay, J.; Taheri, M.; Thomas, D. Y.; Bergeron, J. J. The ER glycoprotein quality control system. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2004;6:29‚Äì42. The main proteins involved in the ER quality control system are UGGT, the ER lectin chaperones (calnexin and calreticulin), and glucosidase II. UGGT first recognizes the incompletely folded glycoprotein and monoglucosylates it. The lectins, calnexin and calreticulin, have high affinities for monoglucosylated proteins and the ER chaperones that associate with these lectins assist the folding of the misfolded glycoprotein. Subsequently, glucosidase II will deglucosylate the glycoprotein. If the glycoprotein is still misfolded, UGGT will re-glucosylate it and allow it to go through the cycle again. Currently, it is unclear how UGGT recognizes misfolded glycoprotein. It has been proposed that UGGT may bind to exposed hydrophobic stretches, a characteristic feature of misfolded proteins.

Silwan is located in East Jerusalem.Archaeology and the struggle for Jerusalem BBC News. 5 February 2010 Silwan began as a farming village, dating back to the 7th century according to local traditions, while the earliest mention of the village is from the year 985. From the 19th century onwards, the village was slowly being incorporated into Jerusalem until it became an urban neighborhood. After the 1948 war, the village came under Jordanian rule. Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 Six- Day War, since which it has been occupied by Israel. Silwan is administered as part of the Jerusalem Municipality. In 1980, Israel incorporated East Jerusalem (of which Silwan is a part) into its claimed capital city Jerusalem through the Jerusalem Law, a basic law in Israel. The move is considered by the international community as illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. According to Haaretz, the Israeli government has worked closely with the right-wing settler organization Ateret Cohanim to evict Palestinians living on property whether classified formerly as heqdesh (property pledged to a temple) or not, especially in the Batan el-Hawa area of Silwan.Nir Hasson, 'How Israel Helps Settler Group Move Jews Into East Jerusalem‚Äôs Silwan,' Haaretz 6 January 2016.

Silwan is located southwest of the Old City Walls and constitutes part of the Jerusalem's \\"Holy Basin\\". The neighborhood has a narrow shape on a north-to-south axis. It is bounded by the \\"City of David\\" (Wadi Hilweh) and Abu Tor to the west and the Ras al-Amud neighborhood to east. Its southern tip touches the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood and its northern tip touches the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery. The neighborhood, originally a village, is built on the southern ridge of the Mount of Olives, where it slopes steeply from approximately above sea level, until it reaches the Kidron Valley, bounding the neighborhood to the west. The historical core of the village is in its northwestern section, adjacent to the \\"City of David\\" across the valley, which is the site of ancient Jerusalem. This location is where dozens of ancient burial tombs attributed to the time of ancient Israel and Judah as well as the Byzantine rule were found. The modern villagers used the tombs as dwellings or as enclosers for livestock.

In the valley below, according to the Hebrew Bible, \\"the waters of Shiloah go softly\\" (from the Gihon Spring; ) and \\"the Pool of Siloam\\" () to water what since King Solomon became known as the king's garden (; ; ). The necropolis, or ancient cemetery, is an archaeological site of major significance. It contains fifty rock-cut tombs of distinguished calibre, assumed to be the burial places of the highest-ranking officials of the Judean kingdom. Tomb inscriptions are in Hebrew. The \\"most famous\\" of the ancient rock-cut tombs in Silwan is finely carved, the one known as the Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter. Another notable tomb, called the Tomb of the Royal Steward is now incorporated into a modern-period house. The ancient inscription informs us that it is the final resting place of \\"\\"...yahu who is over the house.\\" The first part of the Hebrew name is effaced, but it refers to a Judean royal steward or chamberlain. It is now in the collection of the British Museum. At their first thorough archaeological investigation, all of the tombs were long since emptied, and their contents removed. A great deal of destruction was done to the tombs over the centuries by Roman-period quarrying and later by their conversion for use as housing, both by monks in the Byzantine period, when some were used as churches, and later by Muslim villagers \\"...when the Arab village was built; tombs were destroyed, incorporated in houses or turned into water cisterns and sewage dumps.\\"The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46.

An inscription from Siloam, from the lintel of Shebna-yahu's tomb The Siloam inscription was discovered in the water tunnel built during the reign of Hezekiah, in the early 7th century BC. The Siloam inscription is now preserved in the Archeological Museum of Istanbul, Turkey. Another important inscription found at Siloam is the lintel of Shebna-yahu's tomb (known as the Shebna Inscription), which is in the collections of the British Museum. In 2004, archaeologists excavating the site for the Israel Antiquities Authority found biblical-era coins marked with ancient Hebrew writing, pottery shards and a stone bottle cork that confirmed the identification of the site as the biblical Siloam Pool. =Roman period= During the Second Temple period, the King's Garden was used as a staging area for Jewish pilgrims who, during the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, used the spring-fed Pool of Siloam to wash and ritually purify themselves before ascending the monumental stepped street to the Temple Mount while singing hymns based on Psalms. On Sukkot water was brought from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple and poured upon the altar (Suk iv 9) and the priests also drank of this water (Ab. R. N. xxxv). In the New Testament, the collapse of the Tower of Siloam is cited by Jesus as one of two examples where sudden, untimely death came to people who didn't necessarily deserve it more than most other sinful people. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus healed a man who had been blind from birth. Jesus spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man‚Äôs eyes. He then told the man, \\"Go wash yourself in the Pool of Siloam.\\" So the man went and washed and came back seeing.

Lower down than this, again, is Job's Well (Bir Ayyub). It is said that on the Night of 'Arafat the water of the holy well Zamzam, at Makkah, comes underground to the water of the Spring (of Siloam).

Moshe Gil interprets statements by Muqaddasi (writing in 985), Nasir-i Khusraw (1047), and Yaqut (1225), as meaning that what they called the Spring of Silwan can only be a water source located at quite a distance farther south, Khusraw actually indicating a distance of c. 3 km from Jerusalem's walls. This leads to Gil identifying this \\"Spring of Silwan\\" with what we know today as the Spring of Bir Ayyub (biblical Ein Rogel), whose exact location in those days cannot be pinpointed anymore, but was in any case several km away from the city walls. =Ottoman period= Silwan (\\"vilage de Siloe\\") in Louis Deshayes' Voyage du Levant, fait par le commandement du roi en 1621 View of Silwan from the south, ca. 1864 Maison Bonfils, ca. 1890 Women from Silwan, carrying containers filled with labneh, by Bonfils, ca. 1890 In 1596, Ayn Silwan appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Quds of the Liwa of Quds, with a population of 60 households, all Muslim.

Silwan from Abu Tor, looking towards the Israeli West Bank barrier near the Old City In the twentieth century, Silwan grew northward towards Jerusalem, expanding from a small farming village into an urban neighborhood. Modern Arab Silwan encompasses Old Silwan (generally to the south), the Yemenite village (to the north), and the once-vacant land between. Today Silwan follows the ridge of the southern peak of the Mount of Olives to the east of the Kidron Valley, from the ridge west of the Ophel up to the southern wall of the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. In the 1945 statistics the population of Silwan was 3,820; 3,680 Muslims and 140 Christians,Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 25 with a total of 5,421 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

It remained under Jordanian rule until 1967, when Israel captured the Old City and surrounding region. Until then, the village had delegates in the Jerusalem City Council. =Palestinian- Israeli conflict= Since the 1967 Six-Day War Silwan has been under Israeli occupation, and Jewish organizations have sought to re-establish a Jewish presence there. The Ir David Foundation and the Ateret Cohanim organizations are promoting resettlement of Jews in the neighborhood in cooperation with the Committee for the Renewal of the Yemenite Village in Shiloah. In 1987, the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to inform him of Israeli settlement activity; his letter noted that an Israeli company had taken over two Palestinian houses in the neighborhood of al-Bustan, also called King's Garden, after evicting their occupants, claiming the houses were its property.\\"Letter dated 16 October 1987 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General\\" UN General Assembly Security Council City of David (Wadi Hilweh), an area of Silwan close to the southern wall of the Old City, and its neighborhood of al-Bustan, has been ever since a focus of Jewish settlement.

The organization managed to take over control of an Ottoman era (19th century) Jewish trust, called the Benvenisti Trust after Rabbi Moshe Benvenisti, and claims that land in areas of Silwan, such as the Batan al-Hawa neighboruhood, was 'sacred religious land' and that Palestinians residing on this trust land were illegal squatters. The decisions are thought to effectively threaten with displacement some 700 Palestinians in Silwan.'Settlement Report [The Trump Plan Edition,']Foundation for Middle East Peace 31January 2020. The Sumreen family The house where the family lives is in the City of David (Hebrew: Ir David), an archaeological site believed to be the original site of Jerusalem and operated by the Ir David Foundation. In December 2011, a board member of the Jewish National Fund's US fundraising arm resigned in protest after a 20-year legal process came to a head with an order for the eviction of a Palestinian family from a JNF-owned home. The home had been acquired via the Absentee Property Law. Several days before the order was carried out, JNF announced it would be delayed. In 2011 the verdict was overturned. In 2017, the claim was successfully renewed. In September 2019, the Sumreen family lost an appeal and appealed to the District Court. In June 2020, the appeal was rejected. An appeal to the Supreme Court should be heard in six months. After criticism from many directions the JNF has asked for a rehearing of the proceedings. In August, the eviction process was suspended. JNF and Elad are in disagreement over the process. Housing demolition and construction permits In 2005, the Israeli government planned to demolish 88 Arab homes in al-Bustan neighborhood built without permits but they were not found illegal in a municipal court.\\"Jerusalem Municipality plans to demolish 88 homes in Silwan\\"; Al Ayyam Newspaper, June 1, 2005 According to the State Comptroller's report, there were 130 illegal structures in Silwan in 2009, a tenfold increase since 1967. When enforcement of the building code began in al-Bustan in 1995, thirty illegal structures were found, mostly old residential buildings. By 2004, the number of illegal structures rose to 80. The municipality launched legal proceedings against 43 and demolished 10, but these were soon replaced by new buildings. The group Ir Amim argues that the illegal construction is due to insufficient granting of permits by the Jerusalem municipality. They say that under Israeli administration, fewer than 20 permits, mainly minor, were issued for this part of Silwan, and that as a result, most building in this part of Silwan and the whole neighborhood generally lack permits. They also say that as of 2009, the vast majority of buildings in the neighborhood were built without permits, in particular in al- Bustan. In 2010, Ir Amim's petition to halt a municipal zoning plan for the City of David area was rejected. The plan does not call for demolition of illegal construction, but rather regulates where construction may continue. The group said that the plan favored the interests of Elad and the neighborhood's Jewish residents, while Elad said that the plan allotted only 15 percent of construction to Jews versus 85 percent to Arab residents. The mukhtar of Silwan objected to Ir Amim's petition against the plan. ‚ÄúWe have said that there are good aspects of the plan and there are bad aspects of the plan, we‚Äôre still working it all out. But to come and say that the whole plan is bad, and to ask that it be done away with, then what have you accomplished? Nothing.‚Äù Silwan (East) In 2003, Ateret Cohanim built a seven-storey apartment building known as Beit Yonatan (named for Jonathan Pollard) without a permit.

In a 2011 New York Times article, these attacks were called \\"price tag\\" attacks. Demography The Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies put the number of residents to 19,050 in 2012. However, the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are difficult to define, in contrast to the Jewish neighborhoods, because dense construction has blurred older boundaries and Silwan is now merged with Ras al-Amud, Jabel Mukaber and Abu Tor. The Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are fewer than 700 Jews. Palestinian cultural activities The Silwan Ta'azef Music School opened in October 2007. Since November 2007, an art program, language courses for women, men and children, leadership training for teenage girls, cooking classes, an embroidery club and swimming classes have opened in Silwan. In 2009, a local library was established.

Al-wala' wa-l-bara' is referred to as holding fast to all that is pleasing to God, and withdrawing from and opposing all that is displeasing to Allah, for the sake of Allah. This is for their calling towards something other than submission to Allah, whether on purpose or by nature of disbelief. Loving for the sake of Allah means to love Allah and to show loyalty to him by following his Shariah. It means to love all that is good and permissible in the Quran and Sunnah. This type of love requires one to defend Allah's deen and to preserve it. It is to love those who are obedient to Allah and to defend and assist them.

It may have evolved from the Middle English given name \\"Alstan\\", the prefix, Al- itself derived from different Old English words (\\"noble\\", \\"elf\\", \\"old\\", \\"shrine\\", \\"temple\\"), and the suffix -stan (\\"stone\\") derived from pre 7th century Old English. The oldest public record of this derivation is found in 1279 in Cambridgeshire. One branch of this name may have been taken from the manor of a Saxon Lord called Alstanus, he had his manor in Stambourne, North East Essex. It is known that he was still in possession of the Manor after the Norman conquest, although as a tenant rather than owner, he held the land annexed against the King. There are a high density of families with the surname Alston and Alliston from around the Sudbury area, not far from Stambourne. In the 1224 feet of fines it is recorded that John son of Adam de Alliston sold land at Stanfeld (Stansfield) Suffolk. Stansfield is a few miles North of Stambourne. Both Stambourne and Stansfield may have taken their name from √Üthelstan Half-King, Earl of East Anglia in the 930s. Alston also evolved as a locational surname from villages named Alston (or Alstone) in Devonshire, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Somerset, and Staffordshire. The oldest public records of the locational surname in these villages are from the period of 1221‚Äì1246. An alternate meaning is \\"from the old manor\\". The nearest locational name to Stambourne was Alston village in Suffolk near Trimley St Martin, originally in the Domesday Book it was called Alteinestuna. The original meaning may have been Stone of Fire Farm (tuna). Alteines is a Gallic word meaning \\"stone of fire\\" and is associated with sorcery. The church was consolidated to Trimley St Martin in 1362. The coat of arms containing the stars may have been taken as a variant of the coat of arms of the De Veres (Earls of Oxford) who were one of the most powerful post Norman East Anglian families and associated with early East Anglian Alstons.

Initial stages Having developed the photozincographic process, in a meeting arranged between James and William Ewart Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Henry expressed his ability to produce photozincographic copies of ancient documents at \\"a very trifling cost\\".H. James, Domesday Book, or The Great Survey of England of William the Conqueror...Fac-Simile of the Part Relating to Cornwall, (Southampton: by H.M. Command, 1860), pp. 1-2 James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of ¬£1575 for 500 copies or ¬£3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be ¬£11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph. On 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. Joseph Burtt, one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.E. Hallam, Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries, (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 154 Domesday Book in Southampton An 1865 map showing the photography building and the Ordnance Survey offices On arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' \\"fireproof principles, and‚Ä¶military guard\\", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt‚Äôs description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James‚Äôs insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to London.PRO 1/25 16 Feb. 1861 The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse. Permissions and difficulties Having completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the Master of the Rolls regarding the comparison of James‚Äôs photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by Rev. Lambert Larking of Kent.E. Hallam, Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries, (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 155 Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. Thomas Letts of Letts Son & Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties‚Äô photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday ‚Äì but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking‚Äôs lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life.T. Owen & E. Pilbeam, Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791, (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p. 59 The volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.

Built in 1839 to a design by Robert Mills and enlarged in 1866 to a design by Thomas U. Walter, it is an example of Greek Revival architecture. It was designated a US National Historic Landmark in 1971 for its architecture. and The building has housed the Hotel Monaco since 2002. Description The former General Post Office building occupies an entire city block in central Washington, bounded by 7th and 8th Streets NW, and E and F Streets NW. Built in two major stages, it is composed of two U-shaped structures surrounding a central courtyard. The southern section, mainly facing E Street, is a marble structure three stories in height, set on a raised basement. Its main facade is nineteen bays wide, with the entrance recessed in an enlarged bay at the center. Bays are articulated by banded piers on the first floor and Corinthian pilasters above. Windows on the second floor are topped by peaked lintels. The northern section has a more elaborate facade fronting F Street, which serves as the main hotel entrance. At its center is a five-bay entrance pavilion, with an arcaded recess above the entrances framed by Corinthian pillars and pilasters. The building's public interior spaces on the south side exhibit characteristics of Robert Mills' design, including barrel-vaulted passageways. History The site was originally developed by Samuel Blodget, Jr. (son of Samuel Blodgett), who enlisted James Hoban to design a hotel, which was the largest privately-owned structure in Washington when completed in the early 1800s. The federal government purchased Blodget's hotel in 1810, to house the US Post Office Department and US Patent Office. During the Burning of Washington in the War of 1812, William Thornton, Superintendent of the Patent Office, convinced British troops to spare the building. Because the United States Capitol had been burned down, the US Congress temporarily met in the building. In 1836, a fireplace accident set the building on fire, destroying thousands of patent models and records. President Andrew Jackson sought to rebuild the General Post Office, and Robert Mills designed and oversaw construction, with the new General Post Office completed in 1842. The original building was a U-shape, extending along E Street and part way up 7th and 8th Streets. In 1845, Samuel Morse opened the first public telegraph office in the General Post Office. Thomas U. Walter oversaw the building's expansion from 1855 to 1866, when the building was extended and connected along F Street to form a complete rectangle. This expansion was interrupted by the Civil War, when Union soldiers used the basement as munitions storage. The US Post Office Department moved out in 1897. The US General Land Office was a tenant from 1897 to 1917. The US National Selective Service Board was a tenant in 1919, and it was here that US Army General John J. Pershing wrote his report on the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. The US Tariff Commission was a tenant from 1932 to 1988, eventually occupying the entire building. The building was vacant from 1988 to 2002, when Michael Stanton Architecture in partnership with the Kimpton Group was selected by the US General Services Administration (GSA) to convert the building into a 184-room hotel, which became the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Washington DC. The Washington Monaco Hotel was honored with the Washington DC Mayor's Award for Historic Preservation, the Business Week / Architectural Record Award, the GSA Heritage Award for Adaptive Use, and the GSA Heritage Award for Conservation and Restoration.

It is loosely based on the 1867 novel Th√©r√®se Raquin by √âmile Zola. The film tells the story of a Catholic priest‚Äîwho is in love with his friend's wife‚Äîturning into a vampire through a failed medical experiment. Park has stated, \\"This film was originally called 'The Bat' to convey a sense of horror. The film won the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) is a Catholic priest who volunteers at the hospital, providing ministry to the patients. He is well respected for his unwavering faith and dedicated service, but he secretly suffers from feelings of doubt and sadness. Sang-hyun volunteers to participate in an experiment to find a vaccine for the deadly Emmanuel Virus (EV). Although the experiment fails, and Sang-hyun is infected with the seemingly fatal disease, he makes a complete and rapid recovery after receiving a blood transfusion. News of his marvelous recovery quickly spreads among the devout parishioners of Sang-hyun's congregation, and they begin to believe that he has a miraculous gift for healing. Soon, thousands more flock to Sang-hyun's services. Among the new churchgoers are Kang-woo (Shin Ha- kyun), Sang-hyun's childhood friend, and his family. Kang-woo invites his old friend to join the weekly mahjong night at his house, and there, Sang-hyun finds himself attracted to Kang-woo's wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-bin). Sang-hyun later relapses into his illness and wakes in dire need of shelter from the sunlight, having become a vampire. At first, Sang-hyun feels a newfound vigor but soon he is aghast to find himself drinking blood from a comatose patient. After attempting to kill himself, Sang-hyun finds himself irresistibly drawn to human blood. To make matters worse, the symptoms of EV return and only seem to go away when he drinks blood. Desperately trying to avoid committing a murder, Sang-hyun resorts to stealing blood transfusion packs from the hospital. Tae-ju, who lives with her ill husband and overprotective mother-in- law, Mrs. Ra (Kim Hae-sook), leads a dreary life. She is drawn to Sang-hyun and his physicality, and unable to resist odd desires for him. The two begin an affair, but when Tae-ju discovers the truth about Sang-hyun, she retreats in fear. When Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, she turns him down, suggesting that they kill her husband instead. When Sang-hyun's superior at the monastery requests some vampire blood so that his eyes may heal and he may see the world before dying, in disgust Sang-hyun flees from the monastery. He moves into Mrs. Ra's house so that he may secretly bed with Tae-ju. Sang- hyun notices bruises on Tae-ju and assumes her husband is the cause, a suspicion she sheepishly confirms. Sang-hyun decides to kill Kang-woo during a fishing trip with the couple. He pulls Kang-woo into the water and claims to his superior that he placed the body inside a cabinet in a house at the bottom of the lake, putting a rock on the body to keep it from floating to the surface. Sang-hyun's symptoms return so he kills his superior at the monastery and feeds on his blood. A police investigation ensues. Mrs. Ra drinks often after her son's death, sinking psychosomatically into a completely paralyzed state. Sang-hyun and Tae-ju are haunted by terrifying visions of Kang-woo's bloated corpse. When Tae-ju lets slip that Kang-woo never abused her, Sang- hyun is enraged because he only killed Kang-woo to protect her. Teary-eyed, she asks Sang-hyun to kill her and let her return to her husband. He obliges by snapping her neck, but after feeding on her blood, decides he does not want to be alone forever and feeds her corpse his own blood. She awakens as a vampire. Mrs. Ra, knocked to the floor by a seizure, witnesses everything. Tae-ju quickly shows herself to be a remorseless monster, killing indiscriminately to feed, while Sang-hyun acts more conservatively, only killing when necessary. Their conflicting ethics result in a chase across the rooftops and a short battle. Some time later, Mrs. Ra manages to communicate to Kang-woo's friends that Sang-hyun and Tae-ju killed her son. Tae-ju quickly disposes of two of the friends, and Sang-hyun appears to eliminate the third. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sang-hyun tells Tae-ju that they must flee or be caught. Before leaving with her, he makes a visit to the camp of worshipers who consider him the miracle EV survivor. He makes it seem like he tried to rape a girl, leading the campers to chase him away, no longer idolizing him. Sang-hyun then places Mrs. Ra in his car, and with Tae-ju, drives into the night. Back at the house, the third friend escapes, whom Sang- hyun only pretended to kill to protect her from Tae-ju. Upon waking from a nap in the car, Tae-ju realizes that Sang-hyun has driven to a desolate field with no cover from the imminent dawn. Realizing his plan to have them both burn when dawn breaks, Tae-ju tries to hide but Sang-hyun foils her every attempt. Resigning herself to her fate, she joins him on the car hood, and both are burnt to ash by the sun, as Mrs. Ra watches from the backseat of the car.

Production Thirst had been in the works for a number of years prior to the film's shooting and release. As early as Joint Security Area, director Park Chan-wook had asked Song Kang-ho to star in a vampire film Park was developing. Park further developed the film's story with co-writer Jeong Seo-kyeong while the two collaborated on Lady Vengeance and I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK. Once greenlit, Thirst became the first Korean feature made with both Korean and U.S. studio funding and distribution, with CJ Entertainment and Focus Features partnering on the film's production.

History St Leonard's Mill was built in 1760, originally standing in Iham. It was shown at that site on the 1808 Ordnance Survey map, and was still there in 1813. By 1823 the mill had been moved to the new site, which was on the remains of St Leonard's church. An accident when fitting a new stock to the mill in 1861 resulted in the death of Benjamin King, millwright. The mill was working until the 1890s and was derelict by the 1920s. It was repaired in 1935 and dummy sails fitted, which did not last long. The mill was again repaired in 1955. The National Trust became custodians of the mill in 1975. In February 1978, the back of the mill was blown out in a gale. The windmill was blown down on the morning of 16 October 1987. The wreckage of the mill was still to be seen on site the following March. One of the millstones was salvaged and used in the restoration of Lowfield Heath Windmill. The site of the windmill is now marked by Winchelsea's Millennium Beacon. Description St Leonard's Mill was a post mill with a single storey roundhouse, It was winded by a roof mounted fantail. The mill had two Spring sails and two Common sails carried on a wooden Windshaft. The mill was the last in Sussex to retain a wooden windshaft without an iron poll end, this had been removed by 1935. Two pairs of millstones were arranged Head and Tail, with a third pair underdriven by a belt, this from an Upright Shaft which was driven by the tail wheel.

F. Atkinson in 1886. All described species are endemic to the southeastern United States. Originally placed with the Ctenizidae, it was moved to the wafer trapdoor spiders in 1985, then to the Euctenizidae in 2012. Myrmekiaphila appears as the sister group to all southwestern Euctenizidae with the exception of Apomastus, which in turn is the sister group to all euctenizines. M. flavipes was transferred from Aptostichus in 2007. Description The known species of this genus resemble each other in appearance and behavior. The carapace is long and wide. Females are uniformly colored, with some dusky stripes on the dorsum of the abdomen. Colors range from yellowish red to dark reddish brown. The palpal tibia of the males are modified in a way that distinguishes them from other mygalomorph spiders of North America. The first legs in males are modified as mating claspers. All members live in subterranean, silk-lined burrows covered by a silken-soil trap door. Some species construct side chambers that can be closed off by secondary trap doors, a unique feature among Cyrtaucheniidae. While the related Promyrmekiaphila and Aptostichus also build side chambers, they do not close them with trap doors. G. F. Atkinson collected his specimens while hunting for ants, often finding them in close proximity to ant nests. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek (myrmex), meaning \\"ant\\", and (philein), meaning \\"to love\\", referencing their apparent fondness of ant nests. Species it contains twelve species restricted to the southeastern United States, but found in a wide variety of habitats. These range from northern Virginia along the Appalachian Mountains southward through West Virginia, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Tennessee and northern Georgia into the southeastern plain of Alabama, Mississippi Florida, and the temperate deciduous forest of central Texas with dry climates and relatively high altitudes. *Myrmekiaphila comstocki Bishop & Crosby, 1926 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila coreyi Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila flavipes (Petrunkevitch, 1925) ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila fluviatilis (Hentz, 1850) ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila foliata Atkinson, 1886 (type) ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila howelli Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila jenkinsi Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila millerae Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila minuta Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi Bond & Platnick, 2007 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila tigris Bond & Ray, 2012 ‚Äì USA *Myrmekiaphila torreya Gertsch & Wallace, 1936 ‚Äì USA Three species groups are currently recognized.

O‚ÄôDonoghue published his first book Kicking (1975) with the Gallery Press when he was 24Home Page and became the youngest poet to be included in the Faber Book of Irish Verse. In 1980 he crossed the Atlantic to settle in Lincolnshire in the United Kingdom where he worked freight trains between South Derbyshire and King's Cross, Nottingham and Skegness. His book Making Tracks (Dedalus 2001) was largely influenced by this experience. In the early 1990s O'Donoghue returned to Cork. He published an interim collection The Permanent Way in 1996 with the local Three Spires Press and subsequently became workshop leader at the Munster Literature Centre and poetry editor of the journal Southword.Irish Emigrant - News and jobs for the global Irish community In 2004 he was the recipient of an artist's bursary from Cork City Council. In 2005 he published A Visit to the Clockmaker, translations of a selection of work by the Bulgarian poet Kristin Dimitrova. Seven months later he died unexpectedly.

John Calvin (1509‚Äì1564) was a French Protestant theologian during the Protestant Reformation, and one of the most influential reformers. He was a central figure for the Reformed churches, whose theological system is sometimes called Calvinism. Calvin had a positive view of Mary, but rejected the Roman Catholic veneration of her. Marian doctrines Will Durant says that \\"[i]t is remarkable, how much of Roman Catholic tradition and theory survived in Calvin's theology.\\" Calvin's genius was not in creating new ideas but in developing existing thought to its logical conclusion.Durant 465 He borrowed from Martin Luther, Zwingli, Bucer, \\"but most of these Protestant doctrines had come down, in milder form, in Catholic tradition.\\" Calvin gave them stronger interpretation and rejected the Catholic humanism. The criticism of Calvin on the Catholic Church in general and in regard to Mary in particular, is severe. As in the conflicts with Luther and Zwingli, equally severe Catholic counter-attacks led later theologians to the observation, that Mary was used by both sides to define theological positions and identity. To Calvin, Mary is an idol in the Roman Church, and she diminishes the centrality and importance of Jesus. Regarding Marian relics, Calvin commented ironically that since the Roman Catholics believed in the Assumption of Mary, they have been deprived \\"of all pretext for manufacturing any relics of her remains, which otherwise might have been sufficiently abundant to fill a whole churchyard.\\"John Calvin, A treatise on relics, p. 248. =Perpetual virginity= Calvin argues that in (\\"[Joseph] knew her [Mary] not till she had brought forth her firstborn son\\") the term \\"firstborn\\" and the conjunction \\"till\\" do not contradict the doctrine of perpetual virginity, but Matthew does not tell us what happened to Mary afterwards; he wrote: \\"no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist (Matthew), as to what took place after the birth of Christ.\\" At the same time, Calvin argues that the claims that Mary took a vow of perpetual virginity in (\\"How shall this be, since I know not a man?\\") is \\"unfounded and altogether absurd,\\" and moreover he says that, had she taken such a vow, \\"[s]he would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage....\\" Although Algermissen suggests that Calvin believed that Mary in this verse looked into the future and recognized, that in light of this special grace, any contact with a man would be excluded for her,Algermissen 641 this interpretation takes an objection Calvin is refuting in his commentary and makes it his own position. =Mother of God= Calvin rejected calling Mary the \\"mother of God,\\" saying, \\"I cannot think such language either right, or becoming, or suitable. ... To call the Virgin Mary the mother of God can only serve to confirm the ignorant in their superstitions.\\"John Calvin, Epistle CCC to the French church in London Nonetheless, it has been argued that Mary was, in Calvin's view, properly called the mother of God. Proponents of this view of Calvin's Mariology have cited Calvin's commentary on for support. In this verse, in which Elizabeth greeted Mary as \\"mother of my Lord,\\" Calvin takes note of the divinity often associated with the title Lord, saying: \\"[Elizabeth] calls Mary the mother of her Lord. This denotes a unity of person in the two natures of Christ; as if she had said, that he who was begotten a mortal man in the womb of Mary is, at the same time, the eternal God.... This name Lord strictly belongs to the Son of God 'manifested in the flesh,' (1 Timothy 3:16,) who has received from the Father all power, and has been appointed the highest ruler of heaven and earth, that by his agency God may govern all things.\\" Proponents of this view of Calvin's mariology point out that Calvin's objection to the title \\"mother of God\\" had to do with the \\"superstition\\" of the \\"ignorant,\\" presumably a reference to Marian veneration. He does not state that Mary cannot in any sense be called the \\"mother of God.\\" Opponents of this view state that Calvin's comments on Mary as the mother of Elizabeth's Lord may be understood to mean that, in Calvin's view, Mary was mother of the Lord only while he was on earth. Proponents of this view have cited Calvin's commentary on , from which it has been argued that Calvin considered the mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus to have ceased at Jesus' death. In this scheme, Christ, as he was dying on the cross, appointed his disciple John to take his place as Mary's son, so that he himself might henceforth take his rightful place at the Father's right hand in heaven. Upon Christ's words to his mother concerning John, \\"Woman, behold thy son!\\" Calvin comments, \\"Some think that He does not call her 'mother' but only 'woman' so as not to inflict a deeper wound of sorrow on her heart. I do not reject this; but another conjecture is no less probable, that Christ wanted to show that now that He has completed the course of human life, He puts off the condition in which He has lived and enters into the heavenly kingdom where He will rule over angels and men. For we know that Christ's custom always was to recall believers from looking at the flesh. This was especially necessary at His death.\\" =Immaculate conception= John Calvin believed in the doctrine of original sin as well as the doctrine of headship, found in Romans 5:12-21. Considering he believed in both of these doctrines most reformed theologians agree that John Calvin did not accept the doctrine of immaculate conception, considering it conflicted with the aforementioned doctrines and with Romans 3:23 that all have sinned.John Calvin, Works, Serm. de la proph. de Christ: op 35, 686. Taking into account Calvin's belief in headship, this means that Mary could have original sin and not pass it on to Jesus, considering the male is the one who passes on original sin in the doctrine of headship. Since Jesus was conceived by God himself and not by a human man, original sin was not passed on. Said Calvin: \\"We condemn those who affirm that a man once justified cannot sin. ... As to the special privilege of the Virgin Mary, when they produce the celestial diploma we shall believe what they say.\\"John Calvin, Antidote to the Canons of the Council of Trent, Canon 23. =Salvation= Calvin's soteriology was grounded in the belief that Christ alone is sufficient for salvation. He regarded any opposition to this doctrine as \\"pure defiance\\",Pure defiance and consequently denied any notion of Mary as a participant in the mystery of salvation. He rejected the Roman Catholic belief that Mary acts as a mediator between man and God as idolatry, since only Christ can fulfill this role.Quant a L'intercession de la vierge Marie et des Saincts trespasses, revenez tousiours a ce principe, que cw n'est pas point a nous faire des Advocats in Paradies, mais a dieu, lequel a ordinne Jesus Christ un seul piur tous, Ep 1438, Vol 14,21 Calvin forbade prayers and supplications to Mary for the same reason, further arguing that praying to the dead is not a practice supported by Scripture.Algermissen 1988 640 Calvin held that God's salvation or damnation of an individual seals his fate eternally,Durant 462 rejecting the concept of eventual salvation through suffering in purgatory. He regarded the Catholic belief that Mary can intercede on behalf of the dead to be \\"nothing but blasphemy\\" (\\"exsecrabilis blasphemia\\"), on the basis that only God has the authority to determine the amount of grace given to each individual in his divine will. He therefore did not condone praying to Mary for the salvation of dead sinners, as their eternal fate was already sealed long before creation. =Fullness of grace= The fullness of grace is therefore rejected as well, since the plenitude de grace is Christ only. On this point he coincides with Roman Catholic teaching, which sees only in Christ absolute fullness of grace, while the graces of Mary are seen as a gift of God attributed to her.Algermissen 1988 641 On the other hand, Calvin called Mary a treasure of grace,thre sorie de grace because, Mary preserved in her heart not only for her own use but for the use of all things entrusted to her. She preserved things in her heart, not just for herself, but for all of us. \\"She has preserved in her heart the teachings which open the heavenly gates and lead to Christ\\".John Calvin, Calvini Opera Harmonie Evangelique, Ser IX, op 46 309 God wanted to determine the time in which they would be revealed.Algermissen 1988 642 =Advocate= Calvin considered himself the real follower of Mary, because he freed her from what he saw as undeserved honour. Calvin stated that Mary cannot be the advocate of the faithful since she needs God's grace as much as any other human beingJohn Calvin, Calvini Opera Serm, de la proph, de Christ: op 35, 686 Veneration of Mary Calvin had genuine respect for Mary and saw her as a model for faith. \\"To this day we cannot enjoy the blessing brought to us in Christ without thinking at the same time of that which God gave as adornment and honour to Mary, in willing her to be the mother of his only-begotten Son\\". The genuine respect for Mary in Calvin's writing, and his attempt to express his Marian convictions to the faithful of his day in his explanations of the epistles is not fully known or shared by Reformed Protestants after John Calvin. Statues in the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht, attacked in Reformation iconoclasm in the 16th century =Iconoclasm= Some of the Protestant reformers, Andreas Karlstadt, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. As a result, statues and images were damaged in spontaneous individual attacks as well as unauthorised iconoclastic riots. Erasmus described such an incident in a letter: * They heaped such insults on the images of the saints, and the crucifix itself, that it is quite surprising there was no miracle. ... Not a statue was left either in the churches, or the vestibules, or the porches, or the monasteries. The frescoes were obliterated by means of a coating of lime; whatever would burn was thrown into the fire, and the rest pounded into fragments. Nothing was spared for either love or money.Erasmus, Epistle MXLVIII to Bilibald The destruction of Marian paintings and painting of the saints was not ordered by Calvin alone. But, virtually all Marian pictures and statues in Geneva were destroyed as a result of his 1535 order. John Calvin considered the veneration of religious pictures including Marian pictures as heresy. The Second Council of Nicaea, which in the year 787 had specifically encouraged the pictorial presentation, and which was a part of the ancient Christian patristic tradition, was renounced as an illegal by Calvin in 1550.B√§umer, 481 Calvin's influence John Calvin's view on Mary are reflected in the Second Helvetic Confession (Latin: Confessio Helvetica PosteriorChavannes 425) Calvin's view on Mary are reflected in the Second Helvetic Confession, written by Heinrich Bullinger (1504‚Äì1575), pastor and the successor of Huldrych Zwingli in Zurich. Chapter Three quotes the angel's message to the Virgin Mary, ‚Äú ‚Äì the Holy Spirit will come over you ‚Äú - as an indication of the existence of the Holy Spirit and the Trinity. The Latin text described Mary as diva, indicating her rank as a person, who dedicated herself to God. In Chapter Nine, the Virgin birth of Jesus is said to be conceived by the Holy Spirit and born without the participation of any man. The Second Helvetic Confession accepted the \\"Ever Virgin\\" notion, which spread throughout much of Europe with the approbation of this document.Chavannes 426 The French Confession, the Scots Confession, the Belgic Confession, and the Heidelberg Catechism, all include references to the Virgin Birth, mentioning specifically, that Jesus was born without the participation of a man. Invocations to Mary were not tolerated however, in light of Calvin's position, that any prayer to saints in front of an altar is prohibited.

The Yard is the principal open space at the northern end of the academic portion of the campus, flanked by nine academic buildings. It is the site of a variety of campus gatherings, most notably its annual Homecoming festivities, which are known as \\"Yardfest\\". The quadrangle and three buildings, Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel, Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall, and Founders Library, are a listed National Historic Landmark, important for their role in the advancement of civil rights in education during the 20th century. Description The Yard is located in the northern half of Howard University's Washington campus, bounded roughly on the west by 6th Street NW, the east by 5th Street NW, and the south by Howard Place. The southern edge of the yard directly abuts Howard Place, while it is separated from the other roads by intervening buildings. To the north of the buildings facing The Yard lie the school's athletic facilities and some of its residence halls. The Yard is a roughly flat grassy expanse, dotted with trees around its edges, and traversed by an intersecting network of paved paths. At the center of The Yard's northern half, eight paths radiate from a paved circle. A service road runs along the eastern edge of the grass, between it and the flanking buildings. =North side buildings= Two buildings face The Yard from the north. They are the Ida Aldridge Theatre, and Lulu Vere Childers Hall, and house a portion of the school's theatrical and arts programs. =East side buildings= Three buildings face The Yard from the east. From north to south, they are the Armour J. Blackburn Center, Allan Locke Hall, and the Human Ecology Building. Locke Hall houses the school's college of arts and sciences. =South side buildings= Facing The Yard across Howard Place from the south are the combined Founders and Undergraduate Libraries, and the Andrew Rankin Chapel. Rankin Chapel, built in 1894, is the school's main religious meeting place. Founders Library, built in 1939, has historically housed the Howard University School of Law and its law library. =West side buildings= There are two buildings on the west side of The Yard. The Carnegie Building, built in 1910, houses classrooms and offices, and Douglass Memorial Hall, built in 1935, also houses classrooms. Historic significance Three of the four buildings on the south and west sides of The Yard are historically significant for the role they played in the legal school desegregation battles of the 20th century. Howard's law school was the epicenter where the legal strategies were formulated leading to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case. This legal work often took place in Founders Library, where the law school and library were located from 1944 to 1955, spearheaded by Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall. Research in support of this work often took place in departments located in Douglass Memorial Hall, and Rankin Chapel was the site of conferences held to discuss ongoing legal challenges. As a group, these three buildings, along with the Carnegie Building and the quadrangle itself, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2001.

Shoe Goo is a registered trademark owned by Eclectic Products, based in Eugene, Oregon. Product history =Origins= Shoe Goo was created in part in 1972 by Lyman Van Vliet, a 45-year-old senior executive at Hughes Aircraft Co.\\"A Shoe-repair Product For People On The Run,\\" Inc. magazine, September 1, 1982.Sally Koris, \\"Shoe Goo Guru Lyman Van Vliet Cures Tattered Tennis Toes with Sheer Stick-to-Itiveness\\", People magazine, vol. 18, no. 8 (August 9, 1982). As a frequent player of tennis, Van Vliet was dissatisfied with the durability of the soles of his tennis shoes and sought a method to extend their life by repairing them. Although Van Vliet already held several patents related to the aerospace industry, he had no extensive background in chemistry. Nevertheless, Van Vliet set to work to create an adhesive which could be used to create a pliable surface coating for shoe soles, whipping up his experimental blends in a spaghetti pot. The ultimate result of his efforts was a polymer that was eventually marketed as \\"Shoe Goo\\". Van Vliet founded a company called Eclectic Products and began to market his new creation via small advertisements in tennis magazines, with his wife Sandy hitting the road to gain placement in tennis pro shops. Orders began to pour in. In 1974 Sandy Van Vliet convinced the retail giant K-Mart to place an order, and Eclectic Products was firmly established. Although originally developed for footwear used by tennis players, Shoe Goo quickly gained a foothold in the booming jogging market of the 1970s and 1980s.Sally Koris, \\"Shoe Goo Guru Lyman Van Vliet Cures Tattered Tennis Toes with Sheer Stick-to-Itiveness,\\" People magazine, vol. 18, no. 8 (August 9, 1982). Eclectic Products started modestly, beginning with just 22 orders during its first year of existence, 1972. By the end of its first decade, the company employed 15 people and touted annual sales of approximately US$2 million, with Lyman Van Vliet quitting his job at Hughes Aircraft so that he could devote full-time to his new enterprise. Originally based in the garage of Van Vliet's home in Palos Verdes in Southern California's South Bay, in 1976 Eclectic Products established a manufacturing facility in nearby San Pedro. In 1988, Eclectic Products was sold to the Willamette Valley Company, which moved the base of operations to Eugene, Oregon.Eclectic Products, \\"The Scoop on Goop\\", aneclecticblog.com/ Retrieved October 17, 2010. =Uses= Shoe Goo can be used as a pliable adhesive for separated shoe components, as a filler on worn shoe soles, and as a sealer to repair waterproof fabrics and footwear. Skateboarders use Shoe Goo on their skate shoes to both protect and repair damage done by the sandpaper-like \\"grip tape\\" of the skateboard. Shoe Goo can be used on rubber, wood, glass, concrete and metal. The product is also used by hobbyists in lieu of rubber cement as an assembly adhesive for radio controlled models of cars and aircraft, repair of Lexan bodies, and as a waterproofing agent for model boats. It is also used to protect the toe of Cricket Bats. Composition Shoe Goo is composed of: * styrene-butadiene copolymer, * toluene or tetrachloroethylene (a solvent), and * solvent naphtha.

It is based on measurements in Rayleigh surface waves that travel primarily along the uppermost layers of the Earth. It is currently used in People's Republic of China as a national standard (GB 17740-1999) for categorising earthquakes. Surface wave magnitude was initially developed in the 1950s by the same researchers who developed the local magnitude scale ML in order to improve resolution on larger earthquakes: Recorded magnitudes of earthquakes during that time, commonly attributed to Richter, could be either M_s or M_L. Definition The formula to calculate surface wave magnitude is: :M = \\\\lg\\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{T}\\\\right)_{\\\\text{max}} + \\\\sigma(\\\\Delta)\\\\,, where A is the maximum particle displacement in surface waves (vector sum of the two horizontal displacements) in Œºm, T is the corresponding period in s, Œî is the epicentral distance in ¬∞, and :\\\\sigma(\\\\Delta) = 1.66\\\\cdot\\\\log_{10}(\\\\Delta) + 3.5\\\\,. According to GB 17740-1999, the two horizontal displacements must be measured at the same time or within 1/8 of a period; if the two displacements have different periods, weighed sum must be used: : T = \\\\frac{T_{N}A_{N} + T_{E}A_{E}}{A_{N} + A_{E}}\\\\,, where AN is the north-south displacement in Œºm, AE is the east-west displacement in Œºm, TN is the period corresponding to AN in s, and TE is the period corresponding to AE in s. Other studies Vladim√≠r Toby√°≈° and Reinhard Mittag proposed to relate surface wave magnitude to local magnitude scale ML, using : M_s = -3.2 + 1.45 M_{L} Other formulas include three revised formulae proposed by CHEN Junjie et al.: : M_s = \\\\log_{10}\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_{max}}{T}\\\\right) + 1.54\\\\cdot \\\\log_{10}(\\\\Delta) + 3.53 : M_s = \\\\log_{10}\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_{max}}{T}\\\\right) + 1.73\\\\cdot \\\\log_{10}(\\\\Delta) + 3.27 and : M_s = \\\\log_{10}\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_{max}}{T}\\\\right) - 6.2\\\\cdot \\\\log_{10}(\\\\Delta) + 20.6 See also *Seismic magnitude scales Notes and references External links * Category:Seismic magnitude scales ","title":"Surface-wave magnitude"},{"id":"17405610","text":"The Maritime e-Commerce Association (or MeCA) is a not-for-profit group of marine business and technical experts in the UK who are collectively committed to speeding up the process of marine-related business transactions through the development of application-to-application interoperability standards.

The \\"bed\\" in this context represents not simply a place for the patient to sleep, but the services that go with being cared for by the medical facility: admission processing, physician time, nursing care, necessary diagnostic work, appropriate treatment, and so forth. In the UK, acute hospital bed management is usually performed by a dedicated team and may form part of a larger process of patient flow management; a bed manager may be part of such a team. Importance Because hospital beds are economically scarce resources, there is naturally pressure to ensure high occupancy rates and therefore a minimal buffer of empty beds. However, because the volume of emergency admissions is unpredictable, hospitals with average occupancy levels above 85 per cent \\"can expect to have regular bed shortages and periodic bed crises.\\"NHS reforms by the coalition government and bed management technology In the first quarter of 2017 average overnight occupancy in English hospitals was 91.4%. Shortage of beds can result in cancellations of admissions for planned (elective) surgery, admission to inappropriate wards (medical vs. surgical, male vs. female etc.), delay admitting emergency patients, and transfers of existing inpatients between wards, which \\"will add a day to a patient‚Äôs length of stay\\". These can be politically sensitive issues in publicly funded healthcare systems. In the UK there has been concern over inaccurate and sometimes fraudulently manipulated waiting list statistics, and claims that \\"the current A&E; target is simply not achievable without the employment of dubious management tactics.\\" In 2013 two Stafford Hospital nurses were struck off the nursing register for falsifying A&E; discharge times between 2000 and 2010 to avoid breaches of four-hour waiting targets. In 2018 NHS England started a new initiative to reduce the number of what it now called \\"stranded\\" or \\"super stranded\\" patients, super stranded being people in hospital for more 20 days. About 18,000 of the 101,259 acute and general beds in English NHS hospitals were occupied by ‚Äúsuper stranded‚Äù patients in May 2018. By August 2018 2,338 of these beds had been freed. Some of the delays were related to social care, but more related to the management of inpatient stays. In February 2019, NHS Scotland calculated that 1,419 people had their discharge from hospital delayed in that month, most commonly for health and social care reasons. 1,122 were delayed more than three days. Between them they had spend 40,813 days in hospital. Specific problems * Shortage of beds due to lack of other options. Hospitals in developed countries cannot force a patient to leave if the patient's home is reasonably believed to be unsafe. For example, if a frail, elderly patient has recovered from an acute illness, but is unable to dress himself and prepare simple meals on his own, then the hospital must ensure that the patient will have sufficient assistance with these necessary activities of daily living, or the patient must remain in the hospital. In places with a shortage of skilled nursing facilities, home health care workers, and related support organizations, beds may be unavailable for new, acutely sick patients because of the continued presence of the previous patients. This is sometimes known as a \\"bed blocking\\".Bed blocking threat to A&E; unit and Bed blocking, from the BBC * False appearance or unnecessary creation of a bed shortage. \\"Bed hiding\\", as it is sometimes called, is the practice of delaying admissions due to a falsely claimed lack of beds in the appropriate department.Patients Wait for Hours in Hallways; Strain Felt Throughout State New Haven Register, April 16, 2006. Bed hiding has several causes, including scheduling so many elective procedures that there are inadequate beds left for emergency admissions; frequent changes from ward to ward; inadequate communication, so that cleaning staff don't know when a bed has become available and needs cleaning; misalignment of tasks, so that skilled nurses are expected to take time away from direct patient care to clean beds; too few nurses scheduled for a shift; and overworked staff, who may be inclined to mis-report a bed as full, especially at the end of a shift, in an effort to shift the workload to another person.How hospitals are killing E.R. patients at Slate.comPsychiatric boarding at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bed hiding can be significantly reduced by careful tracking of bed status, making cleaning after discharge the top priority for cleaning staff, and even by physically moving patients to the ward as soon as they are ready for admission rather than boarding them in the emergency department. Reducing bed hiding in regular wards can reduce wait times in the emergency department. Causal factors Patients who are medically fit to leave may be delayed by many factors. Delays due to the lack of social care provision, care homes and residential care have received considerable publicity. In the month of April 2019 there were 130,800 total delayed days in English NHS hospitals, a reduction from 145,300 delayed days in April 2018. The proportion attributed to social care decreased to 27.4%, compared to 30.7% in March 2018. 31.7% of the social care delays were patients awaiting a care package in their own home. 6,354 delayed days were patients awaiting the completion of a social care assessment and 9,251 days related to patients awaiting spaces in residential homes. Other delays may be attributable to issues within the hospital, such as delays in arranging medication or completing tests. Further reading  *Day, Christopher (1985) From Figures to Facts.

Photograph by Lewis Hine, circa 1912 In shipping, break bulk cargo or general cargo are goods that must be loaded individually, and not in intermodal containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain. Ships that carry this sort of cargo are called general cargo ships.  Description  The term break bulk derives from the phrase breaking bulk‚Äîthe extraction of a portion of the cargo of a ship or the beginning of the unloading process from the ship's holds. These goods may not be in shipping containers. Break bulk cargo is transported in bags, boxes, crates, drums, or barrels. Unit loads of items secured to a pallet or skid are also used.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 31. . A break-in-bulk point is a place where goods are transferred from one mode of transport to another, for example the docks where goods transfer from ship to truck. Break bulk was the most common form of cargo for most of the history of shipping. Since the late 1960s the volume of break bulk cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. Moving cargo on and off ship in containers is much more efficient, allowing ships to spend less time in port. Break bulk cargo also suffered from greater theft and damage. Loading and unloading Mixed cargo being loaded into ships at Port Adelaide circa 1927 Unloading barrels from a ship, Accra, circa 1958 A refrigerated general cargo ship. Gladstone Star was built in 1957 and scrapped in 1982. Although cargo of this sort can be delivered straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock in advance of the arrival of the ship and for the cargo to be stored in warehouses. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the quay and then lifted on board by either the ship's gear (derricks or cranes) or by the dockside cranes. The discharge of the ship is the reverse of the loading operation. Loading and discharging by break bulk is labour-intensive. The cargo is brought to the quay next to the ship and then each individual item is lifted on board separately. Some items such as sacks or bags can be loaded in batches by using a sling or cargo net and others such as cartons can be loaded onto trays before being lifted on board. Once on board each item must be stowed separately. Before any loading takes place, any signs of the previous cargo are removed. The holds are swept, washed if necessary and any damage to them repaired. Dunnage is laid ready for the cargo or is just put in bundles ready for the stevedores to lay out as the cargo is loaded. There are many sorts of break bulk cargo but amongst them are: =Bagged cargo= Bagged cargo (e.g. coffee in sacks) is stowed on double dunnage and kept clear of the ship's sides and bulk heads. Bags are kept away from pillars and stanchions by covering it with matting or waterproof paper.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 32: . =Baled goods= Baled goods are stowed on single dunnage at least thick. The bales must be clean with all the bands intact. Stained or oily bales are rejected. All fibres can absorb oil and are liable to spontaneous combustion. As a result, they are kept clear of any new paintwork. Bales close to the deckhead are covered to prevent damage by dripping sweat.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 33: . =Barrels and casks= Wooden barrels are stowed on their sides on \\"beds\\" of dunnage which keeps the middle of the side (the bilge) off the deck and they are stowed with the bung at the top. To prevent movement, wedges called quoins are put in on top of the \\"beds\\". Barrels should be stowed fore and aft and not athwart ships. Once the first tier has been loaded the next tier of barrels fits into the hollows between the barrels, this is known as stowing \\"bilge and cantline\\".Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 35: . Barrels which are also known as casks or tuns are primarily use for transporting liquids such as wine, water, brandy, whiskey, and even oil. They are usually built in spherical shape to make it easier to roll and have less friction when changing direction. =Corrugated boxes= Corrugated boxes are stowed on a good layer of dunnage and kept clear of any moisture. Military and weather-resistant grades of corrugated fiberboard are available. They are not overstowed with anything other than similar boxes. They are frequently loaded on pallets to form a unit load; if so the slings that are used to load the cargo are frequently left on to facilitate discharge.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 37: . =Wooden shipping containers= Wooden boxes or crates are stowed on double dunnage in the holds and single dunnage in the 'tween decks. Heavy boxes are given bottom stowage. The loading slings are often left on to aid discharge. =Drums= Loading paper rolls in the port of Hamina (Finland) March 2016 Metal drums are stowed on end with dunnage between tiers, in the longitudinal space of the ship. =Paper reels= Reels or rolls are generally stowed on their sides and care is taken to make sure they are not crushed.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 39: . =Motor vehicles= Automobiles are lifted on board and then secured using lashings. Great care is taken to prevent damage.Notes on Cargo Work by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 40: . Vehicles are prepared by removing hazardous liquids (gasoline, etc.). This is in contrast to ro-ro (roll-on/roll-off) vessels where vehicles are driven on and off the ship under their own power. =Steel girders= Any long heavy items are stowed fore and aft. If they are stowed athwart ships they are liable to shift if the ship rolls heavily and pierce the side of the ship.  Advantages and disadvantages  The biggest disadvantage with break bulk is that it requires more resources at the wharf at both ends of the transport‚Äîlongshoremen, loading cranes, warehouses, transport vehicles‚Äîand often takes up more dock space due to multiple vessels carrying multiple loads of break bulk cargo. Indeed, the decline of break bulk did not start with containerisation; rather, the advent of tankers and bulk carriers reduced the need for transporting liquids in barrels and grains in sacks. Such tankers and carriers use specialised ships and shore facilities to deliver larger amounts of cargo to the dock and effect faster turnarounds with fewer personnel once the ship arrives; however, they do require large initial investments in ships, machinery, and training, slowing their spread to areas where funds to overhaul port operations and/or training for dock personnel in the handling of cargo on the newer vessels may not be available. As modernization of ports and shipping fleets spreads across the world, the advantages of using containerization and specialized ships over break-bulk has sped the overall decline of break-bulk operations around the world. In all, the new systems have reduced costs as well as spillage and turnaround times; in the case of containerisation, damage and theft as well. Break bulk continues to hold an advantage in areas where port development has not kept pace with shipping technology; break-bulk shipping requires relatively minimal shore facilities‚Äîa wharf for the ship to tie to, dock workers to assist in unloading, warehouses to store materials for later reloading onto other forms of transport. As a result, there are still some areas where break-bulk shipping continues to thrive. Goods shipped break-bulk can also be offloaded onto smaller vessels and lighters for transport into even the most minimally- developed port which the normally large container ships, tankers, and bulk carriers might not be able to access due to size and/or water depth. In addition, some ports capable of accepting larger container ships/tankers/bulk transporters still require goods to be offloaded in break-bulk fashion; for example, in the outlying islands of Tuvalu, fuel oil for the power stations is delivered in bulk but has to be offloaded in barrels.Tuvalu Electricity Corporation Presentation, Taaku Sekielu and Polu Tanei (PDF) References Further reading *Marc Levinson, The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger (Princeton Univ.

It was thus important in connection with the subject of bailment, involving as it did the curious distinction that where a bailee received possession of goods in a box or package, and then sold them as a whole, he was guilty only of a breach of trust, but if he \\"broke bulk\\" or caused a separation of the goods, and sold a part or all, he was guilty of felony. This distinction was abolished by the Larceny Act 1861, which enacted that whoever, being a bailee of any chattel, money or valuable security, should fraudulently take or convert the same to his own use, or the use of any person other than the owner, although he should not break bulk or otherwise determine the bailment, should be guilty of larceny (s. 3).

It is in Latin elegiacs, of which the Roman Missal takes the first six for the hymn following the procession on Palm Sunday (the use to which the hymn was always dedicated). Processional use The first couplet, :Gloria, laus et honor tibi sit Rex Christe, Redemptor, Cui puerile decus prompsit hosanna pium, is sung by chanters inside of the church (the door having been closed), and is repeated by the processional chorus outside of the church. The chanters then sing the second couplet, the chorus responding with the refrain of the first couplet, and so on for the remaining couplets until the subdeacon strikes the door with the staff of the cross, whereupon the door is opened, the hymn ceases, and the procession enters the church. Words The words of the refrain (\\"puerile decus\\") suggested the assignment of the hymn in the Middle Ages to boy chanters (thus at Salisbury, York, Hereford, Rouen, etc.). The hymn is founded on Psalm xxiii (Vulgate), 7-10; Psalm cxvii, 26; Matt. xxi, 1-16; Luke xix, 37-38. The Protestant hymn \\"All Glory, Laud and Honour\\" is sung to a free translation of the words.

It follows the story of a 'subbie' (from the suburbs of Silverdale) named Zoe and a 'chippy' (from the city of Rawhampton) named Daz. It is a dual dialogue, with parts being written as if by Daz, and parts by Zoe. Daz's spelling is phonetic with appalling grammar, done by Swindells to show Daz's low quality of education. This contrasts with Zoe's more formal style. The novel discusses the microcosm of the 'chippies' and the 'subbies' in order to discuss the ridge between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in a dystopian future where those living in cities do not have suffrage, and the elite suburb-dewellers control the nation.  Plot  'Subbies' live in the suburbs of Silverdale, a large fictional city. 'Chippies' live in the run-down city. The subbie children like to go out 'chippying' (visiting nightclubs in Rawhampton). This prompts adverts on TV about the dangers of chippying. Zoe is friends with Tabitha, the daughter of a very wealthy property developer. She encourages Zoe to go chippying with her, Ned and Larry. Ned drives them to the Blue Moon nightclub, where Daz is as well. In order to leave the suburb, they tell the guard on duty that they are visiting Zoe's cousin in the next suburb and are made to show their ID cards to the bouncers who guard Silverdale. Zoe and Daz fall in love when they first set eyes on each other, although, at first, Zoe thinks it may be the 'lobotomizer' (coke, rum and 'a couple of other ingredients') that she has been drinking. Larry spots an attractive chippy girl and subtly tries to call her over to him. She smiles out of embarrassment, but he thinks she fancies him. Eventually he shouts out to her loudly, his outburst coinciding with a pause in the music. Her boyfriend picks up a chair and goes over to Larry. A policeman steps between them. The chippy throws the chair, which Larry deflects with his arm. Daz comes over to rescue Zoe, taking Larry by the arm and telling the group to run and save themselves. When Zoe gets back to Silverdale, she realises that she has fallen in love with Daz and starts pining for him. Her Grandma tells her a story of how she fell in love with Gordon Payne when she was younger, but he never noticed her. She warns Zoe that Subbies and Chippies are not meant to associate.  Characters  = Darren 'Daz' Barraclough = Daz is a 'chippy'. He wants to join 'Dred', a sub-killing gang, to get revenge on the subbies for murdering his brother Del. He is in the Blue Moon nightclub, speaking to the gang leader, Cal, when he spots Zoe. When he sees that she is in trouble, he rushes over to help her and, taking Larry by the arm, leads them outside and instructs them to run. Zoe quickly gives a kiss to Daz's cheek. And from then on the story unfolds. =Zoe May Askew= Zoe is a 'subby', coming to the Blue Moon nightclub to please her only friend Tabby; she finds herself wondering if all chippies are bad. She wants to please her friends, and was mostly a good girl before meeting Daz. When Daz helps her to escape from the Blue Moon nightclub, she kisses him on the cheek and then realises she has fallen in love with him. And the story unfolds from there.. =Tabitha \\"Tabby\\" Wentworth= Tabby and Zoe are best friends at school whose parents are close colleagues. Her wealthy father founded the very estate the pair live on. She and her family occupy the grand Wentworth House.

Biography Nudeswirl was formed in 1989 by Shane M. Green, Chris Wargo, and drummer Mike Toro in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The band released an independent full-length LP titled Nudeswirl in 1989. In 1992, they signed to Megaforce Records and released their second self-titled album the following year. They toured with White Zombie, Danzig, Flotsam and Jetsam, Mindfunk, and performed on the 1992 Lollapalooza side stage. Videos for \\"F Sharp\\" and \\"Buffalo\\" appeared on MTV's Headbangers Ball, 120 Minutes and Beavis and Butt-head. The band was known for dark, earthy atmospherics combining guitar feedback, attacks of wah-wah, tribal/teutonic rhythms, rolling basslines, and wavering, lyrically obscured vocals. Combining musical styles from rock to metal, from alternative to psychedelic, all the while infusing feedback throughout. Nudeswirl disbanded in 1995 after their only major label release. Considered a cult band almost 20 years later, other bands such as Tool and Radiohead cite Nudeswirl amongst their influences and they have been hailed by Perry Farrell, John Frusciante, and the Edge. Nudeswirl's CD has been out of print, which relegates them further into the depths of cult obscurity. Guitarist Dizzy Cortright went on to play with The Mad Daddies. Vocalist/guitarist Shane M.

Alford, (1961-14 November 2011) was a British writer and speaker on the subjects of ancient religion, mythology, and Egyptology. His first book Gods of the New Millennium (1996) drew on the ancient astronaut theory of Zecharia Sitchin and became a number 11 non-fiction bestseller in the UK. In his subsequent writings, however, he admitted to serious faults in his use of Sitchin's theory and proposed an alternative, cataclysm theory of ancient myth: \\"I am now firmly of the opinion that these gods personified the falling sky; in other words, the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth which stood at the heart of ancient Near Eastern religions.\\" Alford's recent work focuses on the importance of the creation myth in ancient Egyptian religion. Biography Born in 1961, Alan Alford was educated at King Edward VI School in Southampton, England and gained a degree in Commerce from the University of Birmingham in 1982. He became a qualified chartered accountant in 1985, while training with Arthur Young Chartered Accountants in Southampton. He pursued a career in industry, working for McCarthy & Stone plc, Flight Refuelling plc, and South Staffordshire Water plc (during this time he gained an MBA from the University of Coventry). He left the latter company in 1995, and began a new career as a writer.Author's MySpace Page Books * Gods of the New Millennium, Hodder & Stoughton, 1997; first published by Eridu Books, 1996. * The Phoenix Solution, Hodder & Stoughton, 1998. * When the Gods Came Down, Hodder and Stoughton, 2000. * The Atlantis Secret, Eridu Books, 2001, trade paperback edition. * Pyramid of Secrets, Eridu Books, 2003, trade paperback edition * The Midnight Sun, Eridu Books, 2004, trade paperback edition. Retraction of ancient astronaut theories In Gods of the New Millennium (1996 & 1997), Alford drew the attention of the British public to the theories of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin. The book was a commercial success. However, less than two years later, Alford began to contradict his mentor by arguing that the gods personified the explosion of a heavenly planet which had shaped the creation of the earth. Alford's doubts about Sitchin's theory emerged while reading the Pyramid Texts as research for his book The Phoenix Solution (1998). In so doing, he found little evidence to support the ancient astronaut theory, but rather found correspondences between the Egyptian myths and the ‚Äòexploded planet hypothesis‚Äô of the American astronomer Tom Van Flandern. Alford affirms that the key to his U-turn was the realisation that \\"the gods personified the cataclysmic powers of creation\\". Nevertheless, many of his readers prefer the conspiracy theory that Alford was silenced by the CIA. Having realised his mistake, Alford began his own investigation of the Mesopotamian mythological texts. The result was When The Gods Came Down (2000), in which he refined and extended his cataclysmic theory of myth while penning a hard-hitting rebuttal of the ancient astronaut interpretation. Coinciding with the publication of this book, Alford published on his website an extensive ‚ÄòSelf-critique‚Äô of his first book Gods of the New Millennium. At this time also the paperback edition of GOTNM began to carry a new foreword in which the author expressed his reservations about chapters 6 to 16. In The Atlantis Secret (2003), Alford attacked the Euhemerist and Von Daniken theories of myth, arguing that the Greek gods were not deified heroes or astronauts but personifications of cataclysmic events from the beginning of the world. As for the ancient belief that the gods had granted the gifts of civilisation to man ‚Äì a myth commonly cited by ancient astronaut writers ‚Äì this was a natural extension of the ‚Äòbirth from the earth‚Äô myths which were popular in ancient times.Alford, The Atlantis Secret, pp. 153-57, citing myths from Plato and the Etana Epic. Exploded planet hypothesis of myth The ‚Äòexploded planet hypothesis‚Äô of myth first appeared in Alford's book The Phoenix Solution, and was followed up in his subsequent books When The Gods Came Down and The Atlantis Secret. In The Phoenix Solution, Alford noted various Egyptian texts which appeared to describe ‚Äòthe fall of the sky‚Äô and the ensuing fertilisation of the earth. Drawing on the controversial work of astronomer Tom Van Flandern, he interpreted this mythological drama (which is well known also in Sumerian mythology) as a theorised (but not observed) planetary explosion which took place millions of years in the past. Much of Egyptian mythology, he claimed, was based on the imagined ‚Äòdeath and resurrection‚Äô of this long-lost planet, which was personified as a kind of creator-god. In When The Gods Came Down, Alford extended the scope of his study to Mesopotamian and biblical mythology. In this book, he separated his own exploded planet hypothesis of myth from Van Flandern's exploded planet hypothesis of science. He argued that the Sumerian religion had been an ‚Äòexploded planet cult‚Äô and that its central myth had been encoded in tales of the gods coming down from the sky ‚Äì of the deluge and the creation of man ‚Äì of the wars between gods of heaven and earth ‚Äì and of the sacred marriage of the god and the goddess. One of his most controversial claims was that the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ allegorised the fate of the heavenly planet, and that Jesus in all probability never existed unless as the lead actor in an ancient Passion play. In The Atlantis Secret, Alford underlined the importance of cataclysms in ancient Greek myth and suggested that the Greek gods had inherited many characteristics from the older Mesopotamian deities. He cautioned, however, that the ancients‚Äô belief in exploded planets did not require an actual explosion. Instead, he drew on the work of Victor Clube and Bill Napier to suggest that comets, fireballs and meteorites had been closely observed at the dawn of civilisation, and that the ancient sages had deduced an exploded planet, correctly or incorrectly, from first principles; the sages had then attributed the great cataclysm to the beginning of time. There is an implied criticism of Velikovsky's historicist interpretation of cataclysm myths. Critics of Alford's theory say that it is atheistic, that planets do not explode, or that the ancients did not even understand the concept of a planet. More pertinent are the critics who suggest he is wrong to see the exploded planet as a monolithic explanation of all myth.Diskin Clay, \\"Plato‚Äôs Atlantis and the Exploding Planet\\", The Classical Review 53:01 (April 2003), pp. 56-58. Atlantis theory In The Atlantis Secret (2003), Alford criticised historicist interpretations of Plato's Atlantis story and asserted that Atlantis never existed in a geographical sense.Alford, The Atlantis Secret, chapter 15, pp. 242-66. In keeping with recent Platonic scholarship, he took the story to be political allegory, based on Plato's critical view of Athens‚Äô status as a powerful but decadent maritime empire in the 5th century BC.Alford, The Atlantis Secret, pp. 236-39. But he argued that the story was simultaneously an allegory for the creation of the universe ‚Äì following the geocentric cosmogony of the Greeks.The Observer, Myth of Atlantis all took place in Plato's mind, 16 December 2001 In this way, he claimed that the story was indeed \\"true\\" ‚Äì as Plato insisted it was ‚Äì for the ancient sages believed that the myth of creation was a true account of how the universe had been brought into being. The details of Alford's theory are as follows: that Atlantis was a metaphor for the primeval underworld (the interior of the earth); that the invasion of the known world by Atlantis allegorised the eruption of the underworld; and that Ancient Athens represented the ideal city ‚Äì an archetypal and metaphorical ‚Äòcity‚Äô - which fell from the sky and defeated Atlantis by breaking into the underworld. While much of Alford's interpretation hinges on known parallels in Greek myth, for example Hesiod‚Äôs tale of the battle between the gods and the Titans, the key to his theory is his exploration of parallels between Greek and Near Eastern myths. Drawing upon the recent work of scholars such as Walter Burkert, Martin West, and Charles Penglase, Alford suggests that the Greek poets and philosophers borrowed from their Near Eastern neighbours mythical ideas such as: the birth of the universe in a cataclysm; the fall of the sky; the lowering of 'cities' from heaven to earth; the fall of the golden age; the wars of the gods of heaven and the underworld; the fall of gods, islands and continents from heaven into the underworld or subterranean sea; the birth of all things from the earth or subterranean sea; and the idea that mythical peoples dwelt in heaven, the earth and the underworld.Alford, The Atlantis Secret, chapters 16-20. Alford's theory has been attacked by supporters of a historical Atlantis.Graham Hancock book review A classical scholar welcomed his approach and complimented his efforts to elucidate the story from a mythological perspective, while remaining cautious about the 'exploded planet hypothesis' for the myth of the falling sky.Professor Christopher Gill, Foreword to The Atlantis Secret Ideas on ancient Egyptian religion In his book The Midnight Sun, Alford drew on the work of J.P. Allen to elucidate the 'physics' of the ancient Egyptian creation myth. He argued, following Allen, that the creation myth provided a coherent and consistent account of the creation of the cosmos, albeit on a geocentric view, and accordingly proposed a central role for this myth in our understanding of ancient Egyptian religion.J.P. Allen, Genesis in Egypt: The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts, 1988. He further argued, contra Allen and others, that the sun-god was secondary to the creator-god in Egypt, being tasked (alongside the pharaoh) with re-enacting the creation myth in order that the cosmic order (ma'at) be made to endure for ever.Alford, The Midnight Sun, pp. 1-6, 36-37, 64-68. Alford thus held that the traditional cults of Egyptian religion were facets of a unifying 'cult of creation'. In keeping with this creational view of Egyptian religion, Alford is a sceptic of the orthodox solar interpretation of obelisks and pyramids. He maintains that these monuments commemorated the creation of the cosmos, the benben stone at the apex representing the seed of the creator-god which had been raised from the earth into the sky.Alford, The Midnight Sun, chapter 15. Alford has also proposed that the Pyramid Texts ‚Äì such a puzzle to scholars ‚Äì make sense as a ritualistic re-enactment of the events of creation, in which the king played the part of the creator-god and hence emerged from the earth into all parts of the cosmos.Alford, The Midnight Sun, chapter 7, pp. 154-80. Theories on the Great Pyramid Unlike other alternative pyramid theorists, Alford interprets the Great Pyramid in the context of ancient Egyptian religion. Crucially, however, he redefines the builders‚Äô religion, arguing that it was not a sun cult per se but a ‚Äòcult of creation‚Äô, and he devotes an entire volume The Midnight Sun (2004) to the establishment of this idea. Alford takes as his starting point the golden rule that the pharaoh had to be buried in the earth, i.e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that Khufu was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 4; The Midnight Sun, pp. 352-56, 358-70. He has lobbied the Egyptian authorities to explore this area of the pyramid with ground penetrating radar, and although nothing has happened yet it is quite possible that one day this theory will be put to the test. The cult of creation theory also provides the basis for Alford's next big idea: that the sarcophagus in the King's Chamber ‚Äì commonly supposed to be Khufu's final resting place ‚Äì actually enshrined iron meteorites.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 5; The Midnight Sun, pp. 356-58 He maintains, by reference to the Pyramid Texts, that this iron was blasted into the sky at the time of creation, according to the Egyptians‚Äô geocentric way of thinking. The King's Chamber, with its upward inclined dual ‚Äòairshafts‚Äô, was built to capture the magic of this mythical moment.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, pp. 201-4; The Midnight Sun, p. 357. The rest of the Pyramid is interpreted by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed ‚Äì hence the title of his book Pyramid of Secrets.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 6. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin and there is no way of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that we know of today.Fortean Times book review, October 2003. Once again, Alford's theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid's masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers. Alford's most speculative idea is that the King's Chamber generated low frequency sound via its ‚Äòairshafts‚Äô, the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation.Alford, Pyramid of Secrets, chapter 7.The Daily Mail, 21 June 2003.The Richard & Judy Show, Channel 4, 2 July 2003. This theory is an attempt to explain the builders‚Äô use of stacked roofs with enormous granite beams above the chamber's ceiling.Alford, The Singing Pyramid and the Myth of Creation Egyptologists, however, do not see a mystery in these roofs and would therefore reject this as an unnecessary hypothesis.J. Romer, The Great Pyramid: Ancient Egypt Revisited, 2007, pp. 394-99.

Licensed to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States, the station serves the Pittsfield area from a studio located at 4 Federico Drive. The station is currently owned by and licensed to the Pittsfield Public School Committee, and managed and programmed by Pittsfield Community Cable Broadcasting, Inc. through a Time-Brokerage Agreement. History From 1974 until June 25, 2018, the station's studio, transmitter and antenna were located at Taconic High School on Valentine Road in PIttsfield. The station was first licensed as WTBR-FM on June 27, 1978. In the 1970s under the leadership of station director, Bob Cooper, the station flourished with a wide range of student programming and an organization that continued to build the impressive archive of vinyl records. The station's collection contains an estimated 10,000 records from the late 1960s into the early 1990s. Over the years, the station continued to serve as a significant outlet for the school and community. However, in the several years prior to 2006, the station had become devoid of programming as student turnover left WTBR with dead-air for a vast majority of the time. Return To Air In 2006, a group of radio veterans, led by longtime WUPE-FM News Director Larry Kratka, lit a new spark for the station. Kratka brought in several radio veterans, such as Tom Harrison, Joe Mindlin and Brad Lorenz, all of whom were on-air personalities and producers for WUPE-FM; John Krol, who is the former morning news anchor and Opinion show host for WNAW/WMNB-North Adams and former Berkshire Bureau Chief for WAMC-Northeast Public Radio. Krol's \\"Good Morning Pittsfield\\" served as the anchor morning program with news from the Berkshire Eagle and featured interviews with local public officials, business leaders, journalists and other community leaders. The station also featured unique specialty music programs including the only underground music program in the Berkshires; Mike's Amazing Oldies featuring long lost resurrected music from the vault of host Mike Pezzo; the hard rocking metallic edge of Wounded Radio hosted by Tom Harrison; classic '80s rock and dance of Classic TBR with Brad Lorenz and Joe Mindlin; and the longest-running Polish polka show in the area, Polka Express. Larry Kratka was appointed Student Advisor and was also active in upgrading the technology at the station, including new equipment, upgrading to stereo, and allowing WTBR to transmit its full power allowed by FCC license. In June 2010, WTBR became the first station in Western Massachusetts to take part in the American Cancer Society's 'Relay for Life' in Berkshire County Central/South AND move to a different site and broadcast the event in stereo for 26 hours. The next year in 2011, they followed suit and became the official radio station for the Relay for Life in Berkshire County Central/South. In 2011 and 2012, WTBR broadcast 26 hours for Special Olympics COP ON TOP fundraiser and received and award for its hard work. In 2012, WTBR's Sunday lineup added a popular talk show, Ask The Professor, which used to air on Sunday mornings on WUPE-FM. In February 2014, Kratka retired from WBEC and WUPE, then owned by Gamma Broadcasting, and also stepped down as student advisor at WTBR.  Move from Taconic High School to PCTV  At the regular meeting of the Pittsfield Public School Committee on October 8, 2014, Superintendent Jason \\"Jake\\" McCandless outlined steps that he would be undertaking in the next few months to evaluate the school district's continued operation of WTBR. McCandless cited student safety and FCC compliance among his concerns. At the meeting, a petition with over 1,000 signatures was presented to the committee to save the station. In addition, a crowd of about 15 student alumni and other community members opposed to the potential loss of WTBR addressed the committee during its open microphone agenda item. In October 2015, The Pittsfield School Building Needs Commission voted to seek contractors for site work, pouring the foundation, steel and precast concrete for the replacement of the old Taconic High School building. This new building would not contain plans to house the WTBR studio or transmission facilities. By June 2017, the Pittsfield Public School Committee was exploring potential partnerships with higher education, and other radio and media outlets for a new home for the station. United Cerebral Palsy of Berkshire County was considered as a potential partner. On April 18, 2018, the Pittsfield Public School Committee voted to enter into a Time-Brokerage Agreement with Pittsfield Community Cable Broadcasting, Inc., operating as Pittsfield Community Television, to manage and program the station. The TBA took effect on July 1, 2018. On June 25, 2018, after a two-hour broadcast finale of Good Morning PIttsfield, the station was taken silent in anticipation of the demolition of Taconic High School, which housed the studio and transmission facilities. The studio and transmission equipment, along with the entire vinyl music collection, were moved to the Pittsfield Community Television facility on Federico Drive before the old Taconic High School building was demolished. A new studio was constructed as preparations were underway to relocate the transmitter and antenna. On December 15, 2018, regular broadcasts resumed at a lower power under a Special Temporary Authority granted by the Federal Communications Commission. On January 3, 2019, the first live studio broadcast from the new studio at Federico Drive was aired. The broadcast was hosted by William Sturgeon, and featured as guests Superintendent Jason McCandless, School Committee Chair Katherine Yon, Pittsfield Community Television Executive Director Shawn Serre, along with several station alumni and PCTV staff. On July 2, 2019, WTBR-FM applied to permanently move their transmitter to a building in downtown Pittsfield. The site change became permanent and licensed on November 1, 2019.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101787452&formid;=340&fac;_num=52749 Events Over the years, WTBR has provided entertainment and broadcast live from events throughout Berkshire County.

Of note, NASA astronaut, Stephanie D. Wilson, was a member of the radio club and she hosted her own program on WTBR. A 1984 graduate of Taconic High School, Wilson would go on to become the second African-American woman in space, taking part in three successful Space Shuttle missions in 2006, 2007 and 2010.

It is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc.. The station serves as Greenville's Black Information Network affiliate. History =WMRC= WMRC signed on at 1500 kHz on September 22, 1940, under the ownership of the Textile Broadcasting Company. The Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate moved to 1490 kHz with NARBA in 1941 and to 1440 in 1949, giving it a power increase to 5,000 watts. Jolley was the local Royal Crown Cola bottler, and the WMRC call letters stood for \\"We Make Royal Crown\\". WMRC targeted local textile communities through southern gospel, World Transcription Library programs, and live country through Mutual. WMRC's popularity began to increase via morning man Sid Tear, news reporter Martin Agronski, and Meeting House in Dixie, one of its first religious programs. When the ban on phonograph records ended, popular local personalities began to emerge, like Bob Poole with \\"Poole's Party Line,\\" and Frank Cope with \\"The Ole Lazy Man Show.\\" Local university football games, Saturday afternoon's \\"The Metropolitan Opera,\\" and the weekday special \\"The Breakfast Club\\" with Don McNeal were huge hits. 1953 was a year of change for WMRC. The station, which had changed networks to ABC and now had an outlet at 94.9 FM, shut down the FM outlet (whose Paris Mountain transmitter site was used to start WGVL TV channel 23 that August). However, Textile Broadcasting had its own television plans. When the Carolina, Blue Ridge and Textile Broadcasting Companies merged, the station went off the air: the new company was WFBC, Inc., and WFBC radio and television absorbed WMRC's staff. The merger took effect on November 15, 1953. 1440 AM was off the air until the sale to the Piedmont Broadcasting Company was completed at 5:45 p.m. on February 7, 1954. At that time, station WAKE, which had started up in 1950 after WMRC's frequency change, moved its operation from 1490 to 1440 (and a new licensee took over 1490 as WMRB), upgrading from 250 to 5,000 watts in the process. WAKE was a CBS affiliate. =WQOK= On July 4, 1955, WAKE changed its call letters to WQOK, relaunching under the management of R. W. Rounsaville; in 1957, Dick Broadcasting‚Äîwhich also owned stations in Chattanooga and Knoxville‚Äîpurchased WQOK from Speidel-Fisher Broadcasting, which had earlier in the year bought out the other interests in Piedmont. In 1958, WQOK became a Top 40 station programmed by veteran Greenville radio programmer Jerry Mosteller (1922-2013). The station quickly became number one in the market with an endless stream of \\"rock and roll\\" as well as \\"rhythm and blues\\" music broadcast from the \\"Four Towers Of Power\\" on White Horse Road. WQOK found its place in Greenville's radio market with many business in the Upstate area advertising on \\"1440 Greenville\\". WQOK, often known as \\"The Big Q\\", was one of the first stations in the area to use fast talking, big voiced disc jockeys that would introduce the records with \\"jive talk\\" and take telephone requests from the listeners. The station also did live remotes for personal connections with its listeners. WQOK had a stable of popular DJs from 1958 through the late 1960s. Personalities such as Ken Dee (Dockins), Lake Cely, John Hudson, Sonny Epps, Bo Sanders, Carl Stubbs, Mal Harrison, Lee Sims, Paul Gold, Wayne Seal (later to become Governor Robert McNair's press secretary), Rick Fight, Dan Ellis, Charlie \\"Byrd\\" Lindsey, \\"Wild\\" Bill West, Noel Belue, Andy Rector, Mike Jones, Jack Kirby (aka Milton Bagby), Teddy Vee (aka Ted Vigodsky), Don \\"Happy Hearts\\" Bagwell, Little Davey Dee (aka Dave Dannheisser), Jim McAlister, Pete Dawley, Dave Wild (aka Dave Scott at other stations and Scott Studios) and Eston Johnson. Bill Hudson, a mid-day DJ, was also program director in the mid 1960s. The station was popular with the younger demographics (12-24). In one survey in 1961, (Pulse, Spring 1961), Ken Dee (Dockins) had 62% of the total radio audience during his afternoon show. Noel Belue's morning show in 1961 captured 40% of Greenville's total radio audience. Rick Fight's \\"Crazy\\" afternoon show in 1959 had 55% (Pulse, Spring 1959) of the Greenville radio audience. Rick later moved to Greenville station WFBC, when management there made him a better offer, due to his popularity at 1440 WQOK. The station utilized many jingles for weather, news, the time of day and DJ identification. These were played with the sounds of happy voices, honking horns and guitars twanging. The lyrics to one of the early jingles read: T.C. Hooper purchased WQOK from Dick Broadcasting in 1968. For many years, into the early 1980s, WQOK remained one of Greenville's top stations. It was Greenville's \\"Top 40\\" station for 25 years and kept the same basic format. However, as FM slowly took over the majority of radio listenership, WQOK went dark in the early 1980s. Among the former announcers at the station prior to its demise are: Lee Nolan, Gary Jackson, Lee Alexander, Russ Cassell, Steve Chris, Dan Stevens, Kenny Bridwell, Jay (Weekend) Michaels, Teddy \\"Vee\\" Vigodsky, Davey \\"Dee\\" Dannheisser, Chris Scott, John Foster (Dr. John) Brother Bill, Lisa Rollins and Kirby Stevens (who broadcast for 60 hours for the Heart Association). =WGVL= 1440 WQOK turned off its transmitters for a brief while and was sold to Key Market Broadcasting, owner of WSSL-FM, and Kirby Confer in 1982. It was then simulcast with sister station WGVL-FM, now WSSL- FM. WGVL was purchased by Clear Channel Communications, along with country music simulcast partner WSSL-FM, in 1999. WGVL became the Greenville market's first Spanish station on July 11, 1999. Other formats considered, according to Bill McMartin of AMFM, were Radio Disney and sports talk. The station broadcast a wide range of Spanish music. The styles of music ranged from \\"hot Latin pop\\" such as Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez to salsa, merengue, Colombian tropical, Mexican and vallenato, with ballads, boleros and tangos at night. WGVL also aired news and sports programming, including soccer. Program director Carlos Garcia, a Colombia native, made sure that many cultures were served, not just one.\\"Radio Station Switches to 24-Hour Spanish Format,\\" The Charlotte Observer, July 15, 1999. Eventually, the station was leased in a local marketing agreement to various Spanish broadcasters. On September 1, 2009, the station changed format from \\"La Invasora\\" and Spanish music and began simulcasting Shine 96.7 WROO's Christian contemporary format, ending the local marketing agreement and putting the station back in the hands of Clear Channel Communications. Afterwards, the simulcast was discontinued, and 1440 began airing programming from ESPN Radio, being leased by Greenville Radio Group, LLC and operated by veteran broadcaster Greg McKinney, who had previously programmed AC stations WSPA-FM and WMYI in the market. In November 2009, WGVL opened newly built studios in Greenville, SC. The station had a programming agreement with ESPN Radio, and aired the network's lineup of Mike and Mike in the Morning, Colin Cowherd, and Scott Van Pelt. Weekday afternoons, 4 p.m.-6 p.m., WGVL aired The Score Radio Show, featuring local sports personalities Will Merritt, George Rogers, Will Bouton, and others. On weekday evenings from 6 p.m.-8 p.m., the station presented Phil Kornblut's Sportstalk. Logo as a Fox Sports Radio affiliate In late 2011, the LMA with Greenville Radio Group ended due to unknown reasons, and Clear Channel took control of the station once again. Clear Channel retained the ESPN Radio programming and program schedule that had been broadcast on 1440. Late in 2012, WGVL switched to Fox Sports Radio. On June 29, 2020, fifteen iHeart stations in markets with large African American populations, including WGVL, began stunting with African American speeches, interspersed with messages such as \\"Our Voices Will Be Heard\\" and \\"Our side of the story is about to be told,\\" with a new format slated to launch on June 30.Fifteen iHeartMedia Stations Stunting Ahead Of New Network Launch That day, WGVL, along with the other fourteen stations, became the launch stations for the Black Information Network, an African American-oriented all-news network.

In this form they are a traditional Latin Christian prayer. These words form the introductory prayer to every Hour of the Roman, Ambrosian, and monastic Breviaries, except during the last three days of Holy Week, and in the Office of the Dead. While these are recited or sung, all present bless themselves with the sign of the cross. Tradition says that Benedict of Nursia introduced this custom into the monastic Office, heavily influenced by the writings of Saint John Cassian. Saint Gregory the Great extended it to all the Roman churches. Saint John Cassian (Coll., X, 10) wrote that from the earliest Christian times the monks used this introduction very often, including outside of the liturgical prayers, as an invocation for every situation, for times of temptation, tiredness, and joy. Liturgical use In placing this supplication at the beginning of every Hour, the Catholic Church implores the assistance of God against distractions in prayer. In the Roman Rite, the \\"Deus, in adiutorium\\" is preceded in Matins by the \\"Domine, labia mea aperies\\" (\\"Open Thou, o my lips), whilst in the monastic Breviary, the order is reversed. In Compline, it is always preceded by the \\"Converte nos, Deus\\". In the Mozarabic liturgy the Hours commence with the triple Kyrie Eleison. In all the Latin countries north, east, and west of the Alps, the introduction to the solemn Vespers of Easter Sunday was formed by the nine Kyrie Eleison and Christe Eleison of the Easter Mass. In the churches which observe the Greek Rite, the Trisagion and other prayers open the Hours. The \\"Deus, in adiutorium\\" is repeated three times during the conclusional prayers of Prime. In monasteries, Prime was finished immediately after the prayer: \\"Domine, Deus omnipotens\\"; then the monks went from the choir to the chapter- room, where the Martyrology was read, and the day's work was given out; before dispersing to their several occupations they sang three times the \\"Deus, in adjutorium\\", to emphasize the union of prayer and labour. In popular culture In the 1964 historical film Becket, Thomas Becket (played by Richard Burton) sings the hymn at Vespers on the day he is martyred by four knights sent by his former friend King Henry II.

Martiny (19 May 1858According to the New York Times interview noted below, in which Martiny claimed descent from Simone Martini in Alsace ‚Äì 1927) was a Franco-American sculptor who worked in the Paris atelier of Eugene Dock, where he became foreman before emigrating to New York in 1878‚Äîto avoid conscription in the French army, he later claimed.New York Times interview, 1904. In the United States he found work with Augustus Saint-Gaudens, with whom he remained five years; a fellow worker in Saint-Gaudens' shop was Frederick MacMonnies. A group photograph taken in Saint-Gaudens's studio about 1883, conserved in the Archives of American Art, shows Kenyon Cox, Richard Watson Gilder, Martiny, Francis Davis Millet, Saint-Gaudens, Julian Alden Weir and Stanford White. He often worked in cooperation with architects in Beaux-Arts architecture. He lived in Bayside, Long Island, and had a sculpture studio in McDougal Alley, a fashionable former mews behind Washington Square Park. Much of his work is in New York City, though he provided bas-reliefs for the Art Institute of Chicago and for government buildings in Washington, DC. Martiny was one of the colony who gathered round Saint-Gaudens at Cornish, New Hampshire. Martiny was one of the large team of decorative sculptors assembled to carry out details for the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893, where he settled for a year to carry out the clay models for many somewhat facile decorative allegorical figures, cherubs, caryatids and the like. Karl Bitter diplomatically characterised Martiny's technique: > He works with incredible rapidity and apparently with little reflection, but > always with such an instinct for the right thing, decoratively speaking, > that he rarely fails in his resultsBitter, in The Book of the Fair (1904), > quoted in Michele H. Bogart, Public Sculpture and the Civic Ideal in New > York City 1890-1930(University of Chicago Press) 1989:141. The sculptures, which were carried out in staff, a weather-resistant plaster, were destroyed with the exhibition buildings, but the successful effect they produced led to further similar commissions at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York (1901) and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis (1904). His growing reputation led to his only medal, an award medal for the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. Though he was a member of the National Sculpture Society, Philip Martiny was not considered by his contemporaries as a sculptor of the first rank, and the assignation to him by the Tammany Hall architects given the plum project of completing designs for the New York City Hall of Records (later the Surrogate's Court) after the architect John R. Thomas's unexpected death in 1901, raised objections that tested the New York Art Commission's authority to accept or reject sculpture by Henry Kirke Bush-Brown and Martiny for the building. Daniel Chester French was called in to offer suggestions for improved subjectsMichele H.

In the midst of the project Martiny was interviewed for The New York TimesNew York Times, \\"A Sculptor Who Is Also a Captain of Industry\\", March 27, 1904, giving the first impression that Martiny operated a commercial sculpture factory \\"where Art rubs elbows cheerfully, indiscriminately, with Life's less romantic work\\" but ending with admiration for the sculptor's likeness of the late President McKinley. After the First World War, Martiny received two commissions for colossal figures commemorating the fallen soldiers: the Chelsea Park Memorial, at 28th Street and 9th Avenue and the memorial in Abingdon Square Park, where 8th Avenue commences. Martiny married twice and had eight children. A debilitating stroke ended his career, and a second one finished his life. His papers, compiled by Martiny's grandson, Raymond J. Linder, are conserved in the Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian Institution.

The Lead Pastor is Deacon Godsey; Andrew Davis is the Pastor In Residence; Jill Godsey is the Vintage Kids Pastor. History Founded in August 2004 under the name \\"Heartland K10 Lawrence\\", services were originally held in a variety of rooms on the University of Kansas campus, primarily attended by students. After out-growing space available to campus ministries on a weekly basis, the ministry moved to the Lawrence Arts Center, then to Lawrence Memorial Central Middle School, until moving into their current facility at 1501 New Hampshire St. The church officially changed its name to Vintage Church in the Fall of 2006. Vintage Church was originally a church plant of Heartland K10 (now known as 'Redemption Church', currently located in Olathe, Kansas), which was established by Pastors Kevin Cloud and Tim Suttle. Heartland K10 planted Vintage Church with the hope of establishing a church with similar values as its own in the Lawrence area. Redemption Church itself is a church plant of Heartland Church in the Kansas City area. Beliefs Vintage Church upholds the historic creeds of the Church, specifically the Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed. Vintage Church is committed to the authority of God in scripture, and seeks to root its understanding and application of the Bible in the cruciform character of Jesus as the exact representation of God‚Äôs heart, mind, character and being, through the grace and power of the Holy Spirit. They seek to unite around Jesus‚Äôs life, ministry, teaching, victory over sin and death, and around the foundational convictions of the historic Christian faith. On all other matters they encourage loving conversation in the context of community and welcome respectful disagreement in the process. They have a wide range of thoughts and perspectives on a variety of doctrinal specifics, but try to hold those views with open hands, not requiring everyone to stand in unilateral agreement on them as a litmus test for involvement in the Vintage Church family. Services Vintage's services appeal to a wide ranging demographic, with folks representing all age ranges. Services are held on Sundays at 10:00am. The worship service itself is characteristic of most Protestant churches, typically incorporating a time of musical worship, communion, public reading of scripture, and teaching, followed by a closing benediction. And while Vintage isn't a \\"liturgical\\" church, it does utilize the church calendar from December - May.

Lexis according to Plato  According to Plato, lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into mimesis (imitation properly speaking) and diegesis (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: \\"Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad\\".\\"Boundaries of a Narrative,\\" New Literary History, Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1‚Äì13. JSTOR. p. 2 In the Iliad, a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to Gerald Prince, diegesis in the Iliad is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the Iliad is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.Gerald Prince. A Dictionary of Narratology. 2003. University of Nebraska Press In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the \\"direct representation of the actors speaking to the public.\\"Gennette 2  Lexis according to Aristotle  According to Jose M. Gonzalez, \\"Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\\"Jose M. Gonzalez, \\"Phantasia and Aristotle.\\" JSTOR Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion. Gonzalez also points out that, \\"By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\\" Phantasia is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as \\"our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image.\\" Jana Noel. \\"Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis\\". 1997. Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.  Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle  Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an \\"elevated subject of inquiry,\\" he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech. Often calling it \\"style\\", he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness. Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, \\"it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.\\"The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed. Donald, McQuade. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16‚Äì17 In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the \\"proper method of delivery\\". McQuade 1984, p. 20. Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. Voice At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice. They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In The Rhetoric, Aristotles says, \\"proper method of delivery‚Ä¶affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected.\\" McQuade 1984, p. 164. Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions. The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.McQuade 1984, p. 165. Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice. This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, \\"voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.\\".Taylor Stoehr. \\"Tone and Voice.\\" College English Nov. 1968: JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO. 28 April 2008. . p. 150 However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice. Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.Stoehr 150 Language As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude. The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life. However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance. The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking. In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life. They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech. Most of all, the speaker must \\"give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially.\\" McQuade 1984, p. 18. When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. Also, a speaker must avoid using very many \\"strange words, compound words, and invented words\\".McQuade 1984, pp. 28‚Äì29 Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak. However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of metaphor because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.  Two forms of lexis  According to Aristotle, , meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style. However, is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms. The two types of in rhetoric include: ' and '.Robert P. Sonkowsky, ‚ÄùAn Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.‚Äù p. 259 The separate terms that describe the two forms of , and , have been conformed by several Latin terms. Although the words directly relate to the type of , the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare. ' comes from the term ', meaning realistic painting, and , meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same. His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ' is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.Sonkowsky, 264 ' however is from the term ', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting. Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ' does not need questions asked, but only answers. The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.Sonkowsky, 265 To further understand the separate types of , each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered. ' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence. The delivery of ' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.Sonkowsky, p. 260 This type of is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation. ' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech. ' contradicts ' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance. The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.Sonkowsky, p. 261  References  Category:Literary concepts Category:Narratology Category:Plot (narrative) Category:Poetics ","title":"Lexis (Aristotle)"},{"id":"17406218","text":"Gullhella Station () is a railway station located at Gullhella in Asker, Norway on the Spikkestad Line.

At the end of the Edo period, Kururi Castle was home to a branch of the Kuroda clan, daimy≈ç of Kururi Domain. The castle was also known as , after a legend that it rained twenty-one times during its construction, or, on average, once every three days.Kururi Castle  History  The original Kururi Castle was a mountain-top fortification built during the Muromachi period by Takeda Nobunaga (1401‚Äì1477), and was ruled by his descendants, the Mariyatsu Takeda clan, from 1540. With the expansion of the Satomi clan from Awa Province in the Sengoku period, the castle was taken over by Satomi Yoshitaka, who used it as his base of operations against the H≈çj≈ç clan, based from Odawara Castle. The H≈çj≈ç attempted to take the castle unsuccessfully on a few occasions, and finally seized it in 1564. They lost it just three years later in 1567, when the Satomi regained control. Following the Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi punished the Satomi clan by depriving them of their territories in Kazusa Province. With the entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into the Kant≈ç region, he assigned the fortifications at Kururi to one of his retainers, Matsudaira (≈åsuga) Tadamasa, and appointed him as daimy≈ç of the 30,000 koku Kururi Domain. Osugi Tadamasa built most of the current fortifications of Kururi Castle, and established a castle town at its base. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, the ≈åsuga clan was transferred to Yokosuka Castle in Suruga Province, and were replaced by the Tsuchiya clan with a reduction in revenues to 20,000 koku. The domain was suppressed in 1679, and Kururi Castle was allowed to fall into ruin. In 1742, Kururi Domain was reinstated, with Kuroda Naozumi transferred from Numata Domain in Kazusa Province. He rebuilt the fortifications of the old castle, and his descendants continued to rule Kururi Domain until the Meiji Restoration. In 1872, by orders of the Meiji government, the surviving structures of Kururi Castle were destroyed. The area, containing remnants of moats, earthen works and a well, became a park in 1955. The current donjon was reconstructed in 1979 to boost local tourism. It was built adjacent to the earthen foundation of the original donjon. The Edo period donjon was a two-story, two-roofed structure; however the current structure is not historically accurate, and has three interior floors. The interior is a museum devoted primarily to local history exhibits.

Lutheran Mariology developed out of the deep Christian Marian devotion on which Luther was reared, and it was subsequently clarified as part of his mature Christocentric theology and piety.; cf. p. 235f. Lutherans hold Mary in high esteem, universally teaching the dogmas of the Theotokos and the Virgin Birth. Luther dogmatically asserted what he considered firmly established biblical doctrines such as the divine motherhood of Mary while adhering to pious opinions of the Immaculate Conception and the perpetual virginity of Mary, along with the caveat that all doctrine and piety should exalt and not diminish the person and work of Jesus Christ. By the end of Luther's theological development, his emphasis was always placed on Mary as merely a receiver of God's love and favour. His opposition to regarding Mary as a mediatrix of intercession or redemption was part of his greater and more extensive opposition to the belief that the merits of the saints could be added to those of Jesus Christ to save humanity. Lutheran denominations may differ in their teaching with respect to various Marian doctrines and have contributed to producing ecumenical meetings and documents on Mary. Overview Martin Luther Despite Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos, the Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which at that time was undefined in the Church; however, he maintained belief in Mary's lifelong sinlessness. Regarding the Assumption of Mary, he stated that the Bible did not say anything about it. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. The centerpiece of Luther's Marian views was his 1521 Commentary on the Magnificat in which he extolled the magnitude of God's grace toward Mary and her own legacy of Christian instruction and example demonstrated in her canticle of praise.Martin Luther, Luther's Works, The American Edition, Jaroslav J. Pelikan & Helmut Lehmann, eds., 55 vols., (St. Louis & Philadelphia: CPH & Fortress Press, 1955-1986), 295-358; cf. This canticle continues to have an important place in Lutheran liturgy.Anderson, 239, 381. Doctrines =Mother of God= Lutherans believe that the person Jesus is God the Son, the second Person of the Trinity, who was incarnated in the womb of his mother Mary as a human being, and since, as a person, he was \\"born of the Virgin Mary\\".Cf. the Apostles' Creed. Lutherans have always believed that Mary is the Theotokos, the God-bearer. Martin Luther said: This belief was officially confessed by Lutherans in their Formula of Concord, Solid Declaration, article VIII.24: =Virgin Birth= The Lutheran Churches teach the doctrine of the virgin birth, as summarized in the Formula of Concord in the Solid Declaration, Article VIII.24. =Perpetual virginity= Franz Pieper (June 27, 1852 ‚Äì June 3, 1931) Luther accepted the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary. Jaroslav Pelikan noted that the perpetual virginity of Mary was Luther's lifelong belief,Luther's Works, 22:214-215 and Hartmann Grisar, a Roman Catholic biographer of Luther, concurs that \\"Luther always believed in the virginity of Mary, even post partum, as affirmed in the Apostles' Creed, though afterwards he denied her power of intercession, as well as that of the saints in general, resorting to many misinterpretations and combated, as extreme and pagan, the extraordinary veneration which the Catholic Church showed towards Mary.\\" The Smalcald Articles, a confession of faith of the Lutheran Churches, affirm the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary. As such, this belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary was held by the Lutheran scholastics, including Johann Konrad Wilhelm L√∂he. For this reason Confessional Lutheran scholars, such as Franz Pieper (1852‚Äì1931) refused to follow the tendency among non-Lutheran Protestants to insist that Mary and Joseph had marital relations and children after the birth of Jesus. It is implicit in his Christian Dogmatics that belief in Mary's perpetual virginity is the older and traditional view among Lutherans. Some American Lutheran groups such as the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, however, later \\"found no difficulty with the view that Mary and Joseph themselves together had other children\\".LCMS FAQ - New Testament Another American Lutheran denomination, the Evangelical Catholic Church, on the other hand, considered \\"Saint Mary Ever Virgin, a title affirmed in The Smalcald Articles (Part One, IV [Latin]), and She recognizes her as that Most Praiseworthy Virgin (Augsburg Confession III, 1 [German]; Formula of Concord VIII; Solid Declaration 100 [Latin]).\\" =Immaculate conception= In 1544, Luther said: 'God has formed the soul and body of the Virgin Mary full of the Holy Spirit, so that she is without all sins, for she has conceived and borne the Lord Jesus.'Martin Luther, D. Martin Luthers Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe, 61 vols., (Weimar: Verlag Hermann B√∂hlaus Nochfolger, 1883-1983), 52:39 [hereinafter: WA] Elsewhere, \\"All seed except Mary was vitiated [by original sin].\\"WA, 39, II:107. When concentrating specifically on Mary herself as the Mother of God, Luther acknowledges God's singular action in bringing her into the world, but in making general comments about the universality of human sinfulness, he includes her among all the rest of humanity. =Queen of Heaven= In his earlier years, Luther referred to Mary as the \\"Queen of Heaven\\", but he warned against people using the term too much.Luther's Works 7:573 Luther later rejected this title due to its lack of scriptural evidence and the fact that he felt that Mary's accomplishments should be ultimately attributed to Christ.Kreitzer \\"Luther Regarding the Virgin Mary\\" =Mediatrix= Before 1516, Luther's belief that Mary is a mediatrix between God and humanity was driven by his fear of Jesus being the implacable judge of all people. \\"The Virgin Mary remains in the middle between Christ and humankind. For in the very moment he was conceived and lived, he was full of grace. All other human beings are without grace, both in the first and second conception. But the Virgin Mary, though without grace in the first conception, was full of grace in the second ... whereas other human beings are conceived in sin, in soul as well as in body, and Christ was conceived without sin in soul as well as in body, the Virgin Mary was conceived in body without grace but in soul full of grace.\\" Luther later rejected the stance of Mary as a mediator between Christ and humanity. Luther claimed that though Mary possessed many virtues, she could not intercede for sinners. He claimed that the evidence for Mary's powers as a mediatrix was a result of improper translation of the Annunciation. Instead, Luther believed that Mary's lack of power to intercede is seen in her praising God and his blessings, not in taking credit for herself.Kreitzer,\\"Luther Regarding the Virgin Mary\\" =Development of doctrine= The term \\"Mariology\\", although used by some Lutherans across liberal-conservative lines, was not originally a term coined by Lutherans. Today, some Lutherans prefer not to use the term \\"Mariology\\" to describe their own Marian doctrine because they are concerned the term implies an acceptance of the concept of development of doctrine. Additionally, some Lutherans only use the term in an external sense, such as describing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Anglican teachings concerning Mary. Veneration Saint-Pierre- le-Jeune, Strasbourg Luther composed a number of venerational poems, which focus on Mary's virginity. He also translated old devotional Latin hymns on Mary into German. They express in various ways the incarnation of God through a virgin: The Lutheran views on the veneration of Mary were interpreted differently by different theologians over time. Key is his interpretation of the Magnificat of Mary, which to some is a relic of the Catholic past, but to others a clear indication that he maintained a Marian piety. Luther states in his Magnificat that one should pray to Mary, so God would give and do, through her will, what we ask. But, he adds, it is God's work alone. Some interpret his Magnificat as a personal supplication to Mary, but not as a prayerful request for mediation. An important indicator of Luther's views on the veneration of Mary are not only his writings but also approved practices of Lutherans during his lifetime. The singing of the Magnificat in Latin was maintained in many German Lutheran communities. The Church Order (Kirchenordnung) of Brandenburg, Bugenhagen Braunschweig and other cities and districts decreed by the royal heads of the Lutheran Church maintained three Marian feast days to be observed as public holidays. It is known that Martin Luther approved of this. He also approved of keeping Marian paintings and statues in the Churches. He also advocated the use of the pre-Trent version of the Hail Mary (that is, \\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\\") as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Blessed Virgin.Luther's Works, 10 II, 407‚Äì409 The 1522 Betb√ºchlein (Prayer Book) retained the Ave Maria. Comparison to Roman Catholic and Reformed views Luther came to criticize Roman Catholics for blurring the distinction between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is manifested in human beings and religious service offered to them and other mere creatures. In some instances he considered the Roman Catholic practice of making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry.Augsburg Confession XXI 2 :\\"Furthermore, how will you endure [the Romanists'] terrible idolatries? It was not enough that they venerated the saints and praised God in them, but they actually made them into gods. They put that noble child, the mother Mary, right into the place of Christ. They fashioned Christ into a judge and thus devised a tyrant for anguished consciences, so that all comfort and confidence was transferred from Christ to Mary, and then everyone turned from Christ to his particular saint. Can anyone deny this? Is it not true?\\"Luther's Works, 47:45; cf. also This distinction separates Lutheran views from Roman Catholic Mariology. It is also significant in the context of Roman Catholic claims that modern Protestants deserted Luther's Mariology. Roman Catholics and Protestants may have held some similar views on Mary in the 16th century, but for Luther it was a \\"passive\\" Mariology, while for Roman Catholics it was \\"active\\" in suggesting devout veneration (\\"hyperdulia\\") and constant prayers for intercession. Questions have been raised as to whether the Marian views of Martin Luther could bring separated Christians closer together. There seems to be scepticism on both sides. The eighth \\"Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue\\" addressed these issues. Throughout Luther's life, he called Mary by the title Theotokos, Mother of God,Luther's Works, 21:346. Martin Luther as well as Martin Chemnitz, \\"the other Martin\\" of early Lutheranism, are said to have prayed the pre-Trent Hail Mary, and very likely other suddenly-ex-Catholic Lutheran priests who were contemporaries of the two Martins likewise did. Modern Lutheran synods usually reject or at least do not actively recommend the practice of directly addressing Mary and other saints in prayers of admiration or petition as part of their religious worship of God. Lutherans defended various Marian doctrines, such as the perpetual virginity of Mary, in order to distinguish and distance themselves from the Reformed (Calvinists). When a Reformed preacher came to Saint Bartholomew's Lutheran Church in 1589 and preached against images, the Lutheran Church Fathers responded by placing a statue of the Virgin Mary on the high altar of the church, causing the preacher to retire to a quieter parish. In general, Calvinist iconoclasm \\"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\\" in Germany and \\"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\\" in the Baltic region. At Saint Marien Church in Danzig, Lutheran clergy retained sacred artwork depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary and lit candles beside it during the period of Calvinist dominance in the region.

The museum has exhibits of artifacts related to local history and prehistory, including photographs and musical instruments, and also holds possessions and memorabilia - including letters and journals - of David Livingstone, the explorer and missionary. History The Livingstone Museum is the largest and the oldest museum in Zambia, established in 1934 as the David Livingstone Memorial Museum. In 1948, Captain A.W. Whittington offered to sell the two specimens of a fossilized human femur (\\"Rhodesian man\\") to the Rhodes- Livingstone Museum, but the museum could not afford to make the purchase. A new Spanish colonial-style building was opened in 1951. Jock Millar, former mayor of Livingstone, requested that Harry Susman donate a 'four-faced' tower clock to the museum, but before it was unveiled in the museum, Susman died. In 1960 the museum recreated villages from five ethnic groups to give visitors a sense of traditional tribal life and to present the \\"way of life during the bronze and iron age.\\" Following Independence in 1964, in 1966 the name of the Museum was changed to The Livingstone Museum. In 2003 the buildings were renovated with funds from the European Union. Over the years, the museum has been a trustee of numerous archaeological expeditions in Zambia. In 1956 the museum was a trustee, along with National Monuments Commission of Northern Rhodesia (a former name for Zambia) and the Wenner-Gren Foundation, of the excavation of the Kalambo Falls Prehistoric Site. In 2005, a statue of David Livingstone was erected in front of the museum in memory as was a statue of Emil Holub, a noted Czech doctor, explorer, cartographer, and ethnographer who made the first map of the Victoria Falls region. Geography The Livingstone Museum is located in the heart of the Livingstone town on the Mosi-o-Tunya Road. It is 10 km away from the Victoria Falls, on the Zambian side. Road access is from three directions. The drive from across the border near the town of Victoria Falls crosses over the famous Victoria Falls Bridge. The second approach is from Botswana involving crossing the border at Kazungula by ferry. Livingstone is from Lusaka, taking the southbound Kafue Road, crossing the Kafue River Bridge and taking a right turn towards Mazabuka. Layout The museum provides an important insight into the national and cultural heritage of Zambia. An open archaeological site is located next to the museum next to the falls which has unearthed items from the early Stone Age to the present, covering some 250,000 years. Experts from the museum, such as Dr. J. Desmond Clark, once director, have provided an important contribution to research in the country. The museum has also provided expertise and support to archaeological expeditions in neighboring South Africa, The museum is laid out in five galleries namely, the Archaeology gallery, the Ethnographic gallery, the History gallery, the Art gallery and Livingstone gallery. They cover topics such as archaeology, ethnography, history and natural history, mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, entomology, botany and ichthyology. The Archaeology gallery has exhibits of human evolution and cultural development in Zambia starting with Stone Age to Iron Age. The front of the Livingstone Museum The Ethnography and Art gallery has exhibits of the different cultures of the country. Handicrafts and musical instruments are part of this gallery. The History gallery traces the origins of the Bantu people, the era of British colonial rule and the period till Zambia achieved independence from the colonial rule. Also on display are exhibits of endemic animals as seen in their natural habitats in Zambia. The Livingstone gallery has an extensive collection of David Livingstone memorabilia, which were donated by the Livingstone family. The museum also has a large library of books on archaeology and wildlife and also some of the journals published by Livingston. The museum often has special exhibits; the witchcraft exhibit was said to be \\"especially interesting, if somewhat hair-raising.\\" It also features sculptures and paintings by Zambian artists. Publications The museum started publishing \\"Occasional Papers\\" from 1948 but published the 16 papers in 1967 as a new series titled \\"Zambian Museum Papers\\", based on extensive research of Zambia‚Äôs prehistory, history, ethnography and natural history. These papers were authored by specialists in each field.

Ivers was disappointed that his acting career stalled by the middle 1960s and told the Yakima Herald-Republic in 1978 that he would have enjoyed the excitement of the Hollywood scene and often contemplated what might have been.Bob Ivers, former movie actor and television newsman, dies Associated Press Feb. 16, 2003 In 1965, he launched a career in television news at KPHO in Phoenix, Arizona, followed by WJIM in Lansing, Michigan, and then (in 1970) KTHI-TV in Fargo, North Dakota.

Located from Oslo Central Station, it is served by line L1, L2, L2x and L21 of the Oslo Commuter Rail and by Flytoget - the express train to Oslo Airport. It is located in a primarily residential area and has four regular hourly services operated by the Norwegian State Railways. The station features an island platform accessible from the station building on the south side. The station opened on 29 May 1884, twelve years after the line was completed. The station building, designed by Paul Due, was completed in 1904. It received major upgrade from 1917 to 1922, when an all-new station building and the railway was doubled, electrified and gauge converted to standard gauge. This gave a thirty-minuted headway to Oslo and Sandvika. Stabekk was manned until 1982. History The Drammen Line past the site of Blommenholm Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom: 189 During the planning of the line the municipal council in B√¶rum was consulted regarding where they wanted to have stations. They elected Sandvika and Lysaker. At the time there was a limited population at Stabekk, but not more than that a unanimous municipal council stated that it was within walking distance of Lysaker Station.Sars & Nordheim: 38 Private dwellings grew up in the Stabekk area starting in the 1860s and by the 1880s it had grown sufficiently substantial that it could support a train station.Sars & Nordheim: 41 By then H√∏vik Station had opened between Stabekk and Sandvika.Bjerke & Holom: 192 The first station at Stabekk was austere with only a simple station building and platform. It was taken into use on 29 May 1884. In 1901 there were 87,655 passengers and in 1911 there were 130,462 passengers traveling to and from Stabekk Station, excluding all commuters with a month pass.Sars & Nordheim: 42 The station during the 1930s A new station building was erected and completed in 1904,Hartmann: 126 costing 41,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). About twenty people work at the station during the 1910s.Sars & Nordheim: 46 The line from Sandvika to Oslo was substantially upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at H√∏vik and standard gauge traffic was carried out on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All‚Äìstandard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922.Bjerke & Holom: 196 An interlocking system was installed on 6 October 1924. Stabekk Station was manned until 1 December 1982. The line past the station received centralized traffic control and automatic train stop on 3 December 1992. The opening of the B√¶rum Tunnel, the second phase of the Asker Line, 26 August 2011, meant that express and regional trains bypassed Stabekk Station all together and run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika. Subsequently, the segment of the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Sandvika was upgrades. To carry out efficient construction work, the segment of track was closed and all trains diverted via the B√¶rum Tunnel from 7 April 2013 to 13 December 2014. The work on Stabekk Station was awarded to Implenia and cost NOK 59.5 million. The upgrades include building a new and higher platform, demolishing the old and constructing a new underpass and construction of elevators in connection to the underpass. The upgrades freed up track capacity allowing the number of trains to increase from two to four per direction per hour. Facilities H√∏vik Station is situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station at an elevation of . The station features three tracks. Access to the trains takes place via an island platform, which has access to two of the tracks. The third track runs closest to the station building. Access to the island platform takes place through an underpass which is equipped with stairs and an elevator. The platforms are long and tall, providing universally accessibility. The platform has under- soil heating. The station building The station building, situated on the north side of the tracks, was designed by Paul Due. The brick structure features a mix of Romance and Gothic styles in the gable and windows in Art Nouveau. The station building is no longer used in conjunction with rail operations and instead used as a dormitory. It is listed as a heritage site. Next to the station building there is parking for 120 cars. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Stabekk with line L1, L2, L2x and L21 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 and L2 calls at all stations. L1 is running from Spikkestad Station along the Spikkestad Line to Asker Station and past Stabekk to Oslo Central Station. It then continues along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m Station. L2 is starting at Ski Station running along the √òstfold Line to Oslo Central Station, along the Drammen Line to Stabekk. Stabekk has four local trains per hour in direction Sandvika and Asker, and seven local trains per hour in direction to and from Oslo Central Station. In addition there are two Flytoget trains pr. hour to Oslo Airport Gardermoen. The station had about 600 passengers per day in 2008.

The two men then head to the local railroad station \\"to catch a train out of town\\". Through a series of chance encounters with travelers in the main terminal of Union Depot, Chick becomes, in his own words, a \\"Gentleman for a Day\\" (the name under which the film was released in the United Kingdom). Entering Union Depot, Chick, steals or \\"acquires\\" a station official's uniform. Concerned that he will be caught impersonating staff he retreats into the public washroom, where he finds a suitcase left by a drunk passenger. Inside the suitcase are toiletries and a nice double-breasted man's suit that has a wad of cash in one of its pockets. After getting cleaned up in the washroom and changing into the suit, Chick uses the money to buy himself a much-needed meal at the depot's diner. Soon he meets Ruth Collins (Joan Blondell) sitting on a bench in the main terminal. She tells him that she is an out-of-work chorus girl, is broke, and desperate to raise the $64 train fare to Salt Lake City, where a job is waiting for her. Although she is telling him the truth, he thinks she is a prostitute, and he offers to take her to a nearby private \\"dining room\\" to treat her to dinner and to have an intimate time together drinking. There he becomes angry when she resists further advances after they kiss. He calls her a \\"phony\\" but begins to believe her story after she shows him a telegram with her job offer. Ruth admits to him that she is certainly \\"no Pollyanna\\" but not a prostitute. She then confides to Chick that she is worried about being followed by Dr. Bernardi (George Rosener), whom she describes as a \\"madman\\" and a fellow resident of the cheap boarding house where she had lived. She adds that the strange, obsessive doctor had \\"bad eyes\\" and had previously paid her to read to him in the evenings, namely lewd \\"European\\" publications that she found disgusting. Now feeling sorry for Ruth and describing himself as \\"Santa Claus\\", Chick tells Ruth he will give her the money she needs \\"with no strings attached\\". Meanwhile, back inside Union Depot, among the crowd is Bushy Sloan (Alan Hale), who presents himself as a German \\"musician\\" and carries a violin case. Soon he checks his case at the station's baggage area, depositing it there for temporary storage. The case, however, does not contain a violin; it is full of counterfeit money. A pickpocket later steals Sloan's wallet, which holds his baggage-claim ticket. The thief discards the wallet in an alleyway after removing its cash. While waiting for Chick outside the depot, Scrap Iron finds the wallet. It is not completely empty; the ticket is still inside it. Later he gives the ticket to Chick, who uses it to reclaim the violin case. Initially, Chick plans to pawn the case; however, when he opens it, he is stunned to find it full of money, not realizing it is all counterfeit. He hides the case and most of the bogus cash in a coal bin at a small building near the central depot and instructs Scrap Iron to stand guard while he ponders what to do next. Chick sees Ruth again and gives her some of the violin-case money to buy new clothes at a shop in the station. She too is unaware that it is counterfeit. While Chick is away, Dr. Bernardi sends Ruth a passenger ticket and a message to meet him in the designated train compartment. Believing the ticket is from Chick, Ruth goes there. When she finds Bernardi instead, she begins screaming. Chick breaks through the locked door, but Bernardi escapes through a window. As he runs across an adjacent railroad track he is struck by a passing train and killed. A dress shop clerk (Adrienne Dore) who had sold clothes to Ruth becomes suspicious of the cash she had used. The clerk decides to take the counterfeit bills to the station master. Both Ruth and Chick are then taken into custody by government agent Kendall (David Landau). Kendall has been alerted that Bushy, a known criminal, was at the station to pass the phony money to an associate; but he has no description of Bushy. He therefore believes that Ruth might either be Bushy or one of his associates. To clear her, Chick goes to retrieve the hidden violin case and is escorted by another agent, Jim Parker (Earle Foxe). The men are followed by Bushy, who shoots Parker, and flees with the case. Chick chases and catches him. All is eventually cleared up, and Ruth has a bittersweet parting from Chick, as she leaves on the train to Utah. The film ends with Chick and Scrap Iron walking together along the railroad track, away from Union Depot and back to their lives as hobos.

In his article about the film, one written for Turner Classic Movies, comic- book artist and crime-film enthusiast Frank Miller notes, \\"...the film did leave one legacy at the studio. The impressive train station set built for this picture would resurface in Warners' films for years to come, helping keep production costs down in the time-honored Warner Bros. fashion.\\"Miller, Frank. \\"Union Depot (1932)\\", article, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y.

Because Union Depot was produced prior to the rigid enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code, the film's storyline contains many topics that would have, by the latter half of 1934, jeopardized the certificate of approval needed for a production's release in the United States. Some of these forbidden topics in Union Depot include the following: * Ruth reads what is implied to be very lewd or \\"off-color\\" stories to Dr. Bernardi. * Though Chick stops short of taking advantage of Ruth's plight, she makes it clear that she has \\"been around\\" and is willing to do whatever is necessary for the price of a train ticket. Despite this, she emerges unscathed, which ran counter to one of the Hays Code's requirements that \\"sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of the crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin\\".The Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, reasons for Underlying General Principals, Section 1.(2). * Chick, who demonstrates that he is a thief, liar and someone quite willing to purchase sexual services, is ultimately neither held accountable for his actions nor \\"punished\\" in any way by the end of Union Depot; in fact, he emerges as the film's hero. Critical reception The picture launched its New York debut at the Winter Garden Theater, on January 14, 1932. The New York Times movie critic, Mordaunt Hall, characterized Union Depot as an \\"ingenious, rather than artistic\\" melodrama recalling the (then) play Grand Hotel. He noted that some of the dialogue was at times unnecessarily \\"raw\\" and that Mr. Fairbanks appeared to have \\"taken a leaf from James Cagney's book, judging by his talk and the way he slaps a girl's face\\". He also questioned the realism of a hobo speaking with Mr. Fairbanks' excellent elocution.Hall, Mordaunt (1932). \\"All Aboard!\\", review of Union Depot, The New York Times archives, January 15, 1932.

It is home to historical documents and displays concerning the History of the Gambia. History The Gambia National Museum opened in 1985, fifteen years after the Friends of the National Museum Association was established in 1970. The 1974 Monuments and Relics Act followed, which set into motion the plans for the National Museum. The museum's primary goal is the collection and preservation of artifacts documenting the material culture of the Gambia, as well as to educate both visitors to the country and residents who may not be familiar with Gambian history. Discussions about starting a national museum started in the 1960s, and for the two decades leading up to the museum's inauguration, historians and archaeologists collected artifacts and information on Gambian and West African history and culture. Bakari Sidibe, Abdoulie Bayo and Baba Ceesay were pioneer staff of the new museum. At the Gambia National Museum, you can learn about the cultural heritage of the Gambia, like who the Super Eagles were and what a masquerade is. In late 1999, Hassoum Ceesay, a new graduate in history, became Curator and soon worked with his superior officer, Baba Ceesay, to revamp a part of the original exhibition with a display on the history and Culture and Banjul, the capital. As curator, Hassoum also instituted children's museum activities, such as art classes and history video shows and a robust fine art temporary art exhibition programme, which exhibited paintings and sculpture by Gambian and foreign artists. Museum Description The museum houses three floors of exhibits. The ground floor displays the political and cultural history of the nation's capital, Banjul. On the basement level, you can learn about the musical heritage of the Gambia and see what instruments are popular throughout the country. On the second floor, you can learn about the archaeological history of West Africa and the Gambia. The floor also details the nation's colonial and post- Independence political and economic history. The museum has got a sound educational value. Gambian School children form the largest group of visitors and the museum education programme of art classes, quiz, history video shows etc. has become supplementary to civics and social studies classes. The museum is also the most important tourist attraction in the Greater Banjul Area. It is playing its role in tourism promotion. The museum embodies the countries' cultural and historical identity, with its photo archives detailing over 70 years of Gambian history. =Administration= The Gambia National Museum is not an autonomous public body. It falls under the administrative purview of the National Centre for Arts and Culture, NCAC. The National Centre for Arts and Culture (NCAC) is a semi- autonomous institution established by an Act of Parliament in 1989, to promote and develop Gambian Culture. It takes care of performing and fine arts, copyright, sites and monuments and museums. There are other public museums under the stable of the NCAC: Arch 22 museum in Banjul; Slavery museum in Juffureh; Wassu Stone Circles Museum at Wassu, 300 km from Banjul; Fort Bullen Museum in Barra, and the Culture museum at Kerr Batch Stone circles site in the Central River Region. Kachikally sacred crocodile museum in Bakau, 15 km outside Banjul, and Tanji village museum are privately run. The entrance, Gambia national museum Exhibitions =Portrayal of women= Upon initial observation, the presence of women within the exhibits, focusing on the liberation and establishment of the nation's capital (among the first that a visitor would encounter), appears prominent. Women are displayed partaking in various agricultural and household tasks, such as basketry and food preparation. Apart from domestic involvement, perhaps unexpectedly, women are also shown, through photographic display, to have played a part in radical thought and political campaigning. Portraits of individual women are accompanied with captions alluding to the fact that they did indeed hold positions of distinction and respect within the early Bathurst society. In summary, women are shown in traditional dress, as educators within the school system, as members of active social clubs, as participants in religious pilgrimages to Mecca, as icons of beauty and as mothers, striving towards the continuity of their families.

IOSO approach IOSO Technology is based on the response surface methodology approach. At each IOSO iteration the internally constructed response surface model for the objective is being optimized within the current search region. This step is followed by a direct call to the actual mathematical model of the system for the candidate optimal point obtained from optimizing internal response surface model. During IOSO operation, the information about the system behavior is stored for the points in the neighborhood of the extremum, so that the response surface model becomes more accurate for this search area. The following steps are internally taken while proceeding from one IOSO iteration to another: *the modification of the experiment plan; *the adaptive adjustment of the current search area; *the function type choice (global or middle-range) for the response surface model; *the adjustment of the response surface model; *the modification of both parameters and structure of the optimization algorithms; if necessary, the selection of the new promising points within the search area. History IOSO is based on the technology being developed for more than 20 years by Sigma Technology which grew out of IOSO Technology Center in 2001. Sigma Technology is headed by prof . Egorov I. N., CEO. Products IOSO is the name of the group of multidisciplinary design optimization software that runs on Microsoft Windows as well as on Unix/Linux OS and was developed by Sigma Technology. It is used to improve the performance of complex systems and technological processes and to develop new materials based on a search for their optimal parameters. IOSO is easily integrated with almost any computer aided engineering (CAE) tool. IOSO group of software consists of: * IOSO NM: Multi-objective optimization; * IOSO PM: Parallel multi-objective optimization; * IOSO LM: Multilevel multi-objective optimization with adaptive change of the object model fidelity (low-, middle-, high fidelity models); * IOSO RM: Robust design optimization and robust optimal control software; Purpose =Performance improvement and design optimization= IOSO NM is used to maximize or minimize system or object characteristics which can include the performance or cost of or loads on the object in question. The search for optimal values for object or system characteristics is carried out by means of optimal change to design, geometrical or other parameters of the object. =Search for optimal system management laws= It is often necessary to select or co-ordinate management parameters for the system while it is in operation in order to achieve a certain effect during the operation of the system or to reduce the impact of some factors on the system. =Identification of mathematical models= When the design process involves the use of any mathematical models of real-life objects, whether commercial or corporate, there is the problem of co- ordinating the experiment findings and model computation results. All models imply a set of unknown factors or constants. Searching for the optimal values thereof makes it possible to co-ordinate the experiment findings and model computation results. Robust design optimization and robust optimal control =Introduction= Practical application of the numerical optimization results is difficult because any complex technical system is a stochastic system and the characteristics of this system have probabilistic nature. We would like to emphasize that, speaking about the stochastic properties of a technical system within the frame of optimization tasks, we imply that the important parameters of any system are stochastically spread. Normally it occurs during the production stage despite of the up-to-date level of modern technology. Random deviations of the system parameters lead to a random change in system efficiency. An efficiency extreme value, obtained during the optimization problem while solving in traditional (deterministic) approach, is simply a maximum attainable value and can be considered as just conventional optimum from the point of view of its practical realization. Thus, one can consider two different types of optimization criteria. One of them is an ideal efficiency which can be achieved under the conditions of absolutely precise practical replication of the system parameters under consideration. Other optimization criteria are of probabilistic nature. For example: mathematical expectation of the efficiency; the total probability of assuring preset constraints; variance of the efficiency and so on It is evident that the extreme of the one of these criteria doesn't guarantee the assurance of the high level of another one. Even more, these criteria may contradict to each other. Thus, in this case we have a multiobjective optimization problem. =IOSO robust design optimization concept= IOSO concept of robust design optimization and robust optimal control allows to determine the optimal practical solution that could be implemented with the high probability for the given technology level of the production plants. Many modern probabilistic approaches either employ the estimation of probabilistic efficiency criteria only at the stage of the analysis of obtaining deterministic solution, or use significantly simplified assessments of probabilistic criteria during optimization process. The distinctive feature of our approach is that during robust design optimization we solve the optimization problem involving direct stochastic formulation, where the estimation of probabilistic criteria is accomplished at each iteration. This procedure reliably produces fully robust optimal solution. High efficiency of the robust design optimization is provided by the capabilities of IOSO algorithms to solve stochastic optimization problems with large level of noise. References *I.N. Egorov.

The subsidiary ledger allows for tracking transactions within the controlling account in more detail. Individual transactions are posted both to the controlling account and the corresponding subsidiary ledger, and the totals for both are compared when preparing a trial balance to ensure accuracy. For example, \\"accounts receivable\\" is the controlling account for the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger. In this subsidiary ledger, each credit customer has his own account with its own balance.

It is one of the most important museums in the Mediterranean region and the second museum of the African continent after the Egyptian Museum of Cairo by richness of its collections. It traces the history of Tunisia over several millennia and across several civilizations through a wide variety of archaeological pieces. Housed in an old beylical palace since 1888, it has been the setting for the exhibition of many major works discovered since the beginning of archaeological research in the country. Originally called Alaoui Museum (), named after the reigning bey at the time, it takes its current name of Bardo Museum after the independence of the country even if the denomination is attested before that date. The museum houses one of the largest collections of Roman mosaics in the world, thanks to excavations at the beginning of 20th century in various archaeological sites in the country including Carthage, Hadrumetum, Dougga and Utica. Generally, the mosaics of Bardo, such as the Virgil Mosaic, represent a unique source for research on everyday life in Roman Africa. From the Roman era, the museum also contains a rich collection of marble statues representing the deities and the Roman emperors found on different sites including those of Carthage and Thuburbo Majus. The museum also houses pieces discovered during the excavations of Libyco-Punic sites including Carthage, although the National Museum of Carthage is the primary museum of the Carthage archaeological site. The essential pieces of this department are grimacing masks, terracotta statues and stelae of major interest for Semitic epigraphy, and the stele of the priest and the child. The museum also houses Greek works discovered especially in the excavations of the shipwreck of Mahdia, whose emblematic piece remains the bust of Aphrodite in marble, gnawed by the sea. The Islamic Department contains, in addition to famous works such as the Blue Qur'an of Kairouan, a collection of ceramics from the Maghreb and Anatolia. In order to increase the reception capacity and optimize the presentation of the collections, the museum is the subject of a vast operation which was to be completed initially in 2011 but was not finished until 2012 due to the Tunisian Revolution. The work concerns the increase of the exhibition surfaces by adding new buildings and redeploying the collections. The project aims to make the museum a major pole for a quality cultural development, so that the visitor can appreciate the artistic pieces deposited. On March 18, 2015, an Islamist terrorist group attacked the museum and took tourists hostage in the building. The attack, which killed 22 people including 21 foreign tourists, was claimed by ISIS.

In 1937, it won an Academy Award at the 9th Academy Awards for Best Short Subject (Two- Reel). The film shows a dramatization of actual court records which tell the story of a gang's racketeering in the milk industry, and its eventual defeat through the heroism of one dealer. Plot We see three tough-looking men renting an office in one of the better buildings of Claybourne City. Soon \\"The Creamery Betterment Association\\" appears on their door. They intend to force every dealer in the city to sign as members, dues to be one cent on every quart of milk sold in the city; and the dealers are to get this back by raising the price of milk three cents a quart. Then comes the technique for getting members; the vicious means resorted to in \\"stubborn\\" cases. Only one dealer, John Paige has the courage to hold out. He cooperates with the police, but weakens when his family is threatened. Police persuade him to wait, replace all his drivers with detectives, who arrest the gangsters when they do attack the trucks. Finally, the police surround members of the gang who are waiting in ambush to drill Paige's trucks with a \\"tommy\\" gun. This provides sufficient evidence, and the gang is arrested and sent to prison for 50 years.

Born in Newport, County Tipperary, Coffey first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of nineteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary senior team. He made his senior debut during a tournament game in 1932. Coffey subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medal and one Munster medal. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Coffey won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he began his career with Newport before later lining out with Young Irelands and Cappamore. Coffey was a two-time championship medallist with Ahane. Throughout his career Coffey made a brief number of championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1939-40 league. In retirement from playing Coffey became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he trained Cappamore to junior and senior successes before becoming a selector with the Limerick senior team. Playing career =Club= Coffey began his club hurling career with Newport as a member of the minor team in 1926. He won a North Tipperary championship medal in that grade that year as Kildangan were accounted for in the decider. Coffey went on to win two North Tipperary senior championship medals in 1932 and 1935, together with one intermediate championship in 1934. In 1940 Coffey crossed the border to Limerick and lined out with Young Irelands before later linking up with Cappamore after moving to the village in 1945. Because he was playing with a junior club in the division, Coffey was entitled to be added to the Ahane senior team in 1947. Ahane were bidding to win a seventh successive championship as they faced St. Patrick's in the decider. A 5-6 to 1-5 victory gave Coffey a Limerick Senior Hurling Championship medal. Coffey was retained on the Ahane team for 1948 as the club reached the decider once again. A 2-3 to 0-1 defeat of Croom gave him a second successive championship medal. =Inter-county= Coffey first played for Tipperary as a member of the minor hurling team in 1928. It was the beginning of three successive seasons with the team, however, success eluded him for the first two years. A 4-3 to 3-0 defeat of Cork secured a Munster medal for Coffey. On 28 September 1930 Tipperary faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider at Croke Park. A 4-1 to 2-1 victory secured an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal for Coffey. After making his senior debut in a tournament game in 1932, Coffey made his championship debut on 21 May 1933 in a 3-3 apiece Munster semi-final draw with Waterford. In 1937 Tipperary made the breakthrough after much of the decade spent in the hurling wilderness. A 6-3 to 4-3 defeat of five-in-a-row hopefuls Limerick secured a Munster medal for Coffey. Kilkenny were the opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland decider on 5 September 1937, however, a builders' strike at Croke Park resulted in the game taking place at Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney. Newcomer Tommy Doyle pointed for Tipperary virtually from the throw-in. Kilkenny, who had dominated the early part of the decade and were appearing in their sixth final in seven years, had somewhat of a veteran team that failed to match Tipperary's speed. The Cats managed only a brace of points as Tipp notched up 2-8 courtesy of goals by Dinny Murphy and Coffey. Kilkenny introduced their veteran star, Lory Meagher, at the interval and he scored Kilkenny's solitary point of the second half. Tipperary responded with another goal from Dinny Murphy, as they ran out easy winners by 3-11 to 0-3, resulting in an All-Ireland medal for Coffey. Coffey was a regular starter during the 1939-40 league campaign, however, he decided to retire from the inter-county scene before the championship commenced. =Inter-provincial= In 1938 Coffey was included at right corner-back on the Munster inter-provincial team. A 6-2 to 4-3 defeat of arch rivals Leinster in the decider secured a Railway Cup medal. Coaching career =Cappamore= Shortly after his retirement from club hurling, Coffey was appointed trainer of the Cappamore junior team. In 1952 he guided the team to the championship title following a defeat of Castletown. After making the jump to the senior grade, Cappamore qualified for the decider in 1954. A 2-11 to 3-5 defeat of Western Gaels secured Cappamore's first title in half a century. =Limerick= In 1955 Coffey was added as a selector to a Mick Mackey-trained Limerick senior team. That year Limerick qualified for a provincial showdown with Clare. In spite of being underdogs Coffey's side defeated Clare by 2-15 to 2-6. Personal life Born in Chapel Lane, Newport, County Tipperary, Coffey was the second youngest in a family of eight; four boys and four girls. He was educated at the local national school before later finding employment as a lorry driver with O'Byrnes Mineral Waters in Limerick. On 4 April 1945 Coffey married Eileen O'Connell from Cappamore and the couple had three sons; √âamon, Patsy and Thomas. Coffey died on 29 December 2010 at the age of 101.

Pliny does however say that the sculptor bore a remarkable personal likeness to the mathematician.Pliny the Elder, l.c. ¬ß 5 There is no precise indication of his date. Philip Smith accepted the opinion of Karl Julius Sillig (1801‚Äî1855) that Pliny's date of Olympiad 87 (c. 428 BC) ought to be referred to this artist rather than to a different Pythagoras, from Rhegium; other writers consider it possible he lived closer to the beginning of the 5th century BC. Modern writers consider it certain these two were the same artist, and that this Pythagoras was one of the Samian exiles who moved to Zankle at the beginning of the 5th century BC and came under the power of the tyrant Anaxilas in Rhegium.Herodotus, 6.23-5 While a Samian by birth, he was a pupil of Clearchus of Rhegium. Pythagoras was at first a painter, but eventually turned to sculpture, apparently focusing on portraits of athletic champions from Hellenized cities in Italy and Sicily. Despite his contemporary eminence in his field, it is difficult to estimate his skill and attainments, as no certain copy of his works is known to exist. Pliny reports that Pythagoras' skill exceeded even that of Myron, credits him with the innovation of sculpting athletes with visible veins, and calls him the first artist to aim for \\"rhythm and symmetry\\". In his Natural History he goes on to list several of Pythagoras' works, including a renowned pankratiast at Delphi.Pliny the Elder. Natural History, 34-59. He was celebrated as the maker of seven nude statues (which some theorize to have been a depiction of the Seven against Thebes), and one of an old man, which, in Pliny's time, stood near the temple of Fortuna Huiusce Diei (\\"The Fortune of This Day\\"), which Quintus Lutatius Catulus had built in fulfillment of a vow made at the Battle of Vercellae. Pausanias mentions a statuary of this name,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 6.6.6. and lists several of his works, including a sculpture of the boxer Euthymos, without mentioning this artist's home town. The base of the statue has been found at Olympia however, on which Pythagoras signs himself as \\"the Samian\\".

In Rambles Around Kilmarnock (1875) Archibald R Adamson described it as \\"most spacious, although of a most peculiar form, having no less than seven streets branching off it. In the centre stands a marble statue of Sir James Shaw, who rose from a humble position to that of Lord Mayor of London\\".Ramble Round Kilmarnock - Chapter 1 The seven streets (in clockwise order starting from the north) were Portland Street, Fore Street, Regent Street, Duke Street, Waterloo Street, King Street and Bank Street, and just north of Bank Street, but opening more on to Portland Street than the Cross itself, Croft Street. The heavy traffic in the town led to redevelopments in the 1970s which saw all traffic through this area of the town being stopped completely. Redevelopment A complete redevelopment of the town in the 1970s saw some of the streets demolished, including Duke Street, Fore Street, Regent Street and Waterloo Street. Shops were built along the line of Fore Street's northern end becoming the Foregate, the Burns shopping mall covering the old Duke Street area, and the bus station and a multi-storey car park replaced the Regent Street area. Statues The statue of Jimmy Shaw was at the Cross from 1848 - 1929, when it was removed and placed at London Road. In the town today there are statues placed on King Street to signify where the water runs under the streets. Another statue has been placed at the Cross now that it is free of traffic. The statue is of Robert Burns and John Wilson, the printer of Burns' First Edition. King Street Kilmarnock Cross in 1849 Map of Kilmarnock town centre in 1819 King Street opened in 1804.

Portland Street Portland Street, 2006. Portland Street opened about 1805, not long after the opening of King Street. In 1924 a bus service started operating in Kilmarnock, the tram service which had served the town closed in 1926, as it was no longer needed. In 1924 the bus station was established in Portland Street, this continued to serve the town until it was closed and later demolished in the 1970s. A market operated from within the old bus station, and after the demolition continued to operate from the site there. A new bus station was built during the redevelopment and this is where it remains. Portland Street has been completely demolished and rebuilt with new modern buildings which have become shops, a bingo hall and a super pub.

He previously served as Fifth District Kern County Supervisor representing the communities of Arvin, Lamont, and East Bakersfield. Career Rubio put himself through Bakersfield College and subsequently studied Justice Administration at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, graduating with honors in Criminology. He worked for the United States Department of Justice, then returned to Kern County with a job as an advocate for youth and led an agency that provided health insurance to underprivileged children. For four years, Rubio worked for State Senator Dean Florez. In Florez's Sacramento office, Rubio worked on issues such as the quality of air in the San Joaquin Valley, opposing sludge coming into Kern County from Los Angeles and other surrounding areas, as well as initiatives in education. Rubio was elected to the 16th State Senate District in November 2010, representing all or portions of Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties. In March 2004, Rubio was elected to represent the Fifth District on the Kern County Board of Supervisors and, at the time, became the youngest elected supervisor in California. Rubio had the distinction of being the state's youngest senator when he served in the California State Senate. While on the Kern County Board of Supervisors, Senator Rubio spearheaded the Kern County Renewable Energy initiative and has worked to facilitate the development of some of the largest solar and wind projects in California. Rubio led the effort to combat gang violence within the southern Central Valley. The Kern County Gang Violence Strategic Plan, authored by Rubio when he was a supervisor, guided the tripling of the Sheriff's Gang Unit and created mentoring and after-school programs to steer children away from gangs. He was also awarded the John F. Kennedy Jr. Leadership Award from the California Democratic Party and the German Marshall Memorial Fellowship from the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

State Senate candidacy In July 2008, Rubio announced his intention to run for state senate when Senator Florez's term expires in 2010. He chose not to accept voluntary spending limits and expected to spend $1 million on his campaign. In June 2010, Kern County Clerk Ann Barnett revealed that Rubio was living in the 18th Senate District, calling into question his eligibility to run for office in the 16th. In 2001, Rubio's precinct was incorrectly drawn into the 16th State Senate District. The Democratic California Secretary of State Debra Bowen ruled that Rubio's name would remain on the ballot. Acting in good faith to further address the situation, Rubio and his family immediately moved to a house inside the district in East Bakersfield. He subsequently released a radio ad about the incident citing the mistake as yet another example of broken government. On Tuesday, November 2, Michael J. Rubio was elected to represent the 16th District in the California State Senate. He defeated his Republican opponent, Tim Thiesen, with over 60% of the vote. =Opposition to Proposition 19= Rubio came out against Proposition 19, the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010.

He retired from this position on 30 September 2009. Early life Nimmo Smith was educated as a King's Scholar at Eton College, and studied Classics at Balliol College, University of Oxford (BA Hons 1965), and Law at the School of Law of the University of Edinburgh (LL.B. 1967). He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1969. Legal career Nimmo Smith was appointed Standing Junior Counsel (legal advisor appointed by the Lord Advocate) to the Department of Employment in 1977, serving until 1982, at which time he took silk. From 1983 to 1986, he was an Advocate Depute, representing the Crown in prosecutions and appeals in the High Court. From 1986 to 1991, he was Chairman of the Medical Appeal Tribunals and the Vaccine Damage Tribunals, and from 1988 to 1996 was a part-time member of the Scottish Law Commission. =Inquiries and reports= In 1993, he was appointed along with James Friel, Senior Procurator Fiscal of North Strathclyde, to conduct an investigation into allegations of corruption amongst a so-called Magic Circle in the Scottish justice system, comprising homosexual members of the judiciary, legal profession and police. The allegations included liability to blackmail and giving preferential treatment, including unusually lenient sentences, to homosexual criminals. Concerns had been raised by Linlithgow MP Tam Dalyell with Lothian and Borders Chief Constable Sir William Sutherland. The Report on an Inquiry into an Allegation of a Conspiracy to Pervert the Course of Justice in Scotland was presented to the House of Lords on 26 January 1993 by Lord Advocate Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and found no evidence of the existence of such a Magic Circle, but strongly criticised some police officers, who it said had treated rumours as fact or had been motivated by homophobia. In 1995 he was appointed by Michael Forsyth, the Secretary of State for Scotland, to conduct a local inquiry with the terms of reference: \\"To inquire into the question whether Monklands District Council have failed to comply with the duty imposed on them by section 7 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to make appointments to paid office or employment on merit, and to report thereon.\\" After conducting the inquiry, which included the taking of evidence at hearings open to the public, he reported on 15 December 1995 that there was no evidence that any such appointment had been made otherwise than on merit. The Secretary of State so advised the House of Commons on 20 December 1995. =The Bench= Nimmo Smith was appointed a temporary judge of the Court of Session in 1995, and in 1996 was raised fully to the Bench as a Senator of the College of Justice, a judge of the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary, Scotland's Supreme Courts, with the judicial title, Lord Nimmo Smith. Whilst a judge of the Outer House of the Court of Session, he served as the Insolvency Judge and one of the Intellectual Property Judges.

In 1938, the film won an Oscar at the 10th Academy Awards for Best Short Subject (Color). Plot The opening of the film uses the music of \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", which already indicates that this \\"epicurian epic\\" will entail much comedic content. The scene starts as Matthew E. Smudge calls his wife, Chloe, to inform her that he's bringing his boss and a customer home for dinner. Unstressed, Chloe enters the kitchen, expecting to tell the cook there will be two more for dinner; she finds a note. Apparently, her constant high-maintenance demands have caused \\"her culinary queen to quit.\\" Chloe haplessly attempts to fix dinner herself. An hour has transpired and Chloe has burnt the roast beef, dropped a flour bucket on the dog (to which the narrator remarks, \\"Gosh, it ain't a fit night for man nor beast.\\"), and ultimately turned the kitchen into a complete disaster. Pete Smith, as narrator, asks sobbing Chloe the whereabouts of a telephone. He decides to make a personal call to Prudence Penny, advice columnist for the Los Angeles Examiner. With 35 minutes before the husband and company arrives, Penny shows doubtful Chloe how to prepare a full course, mouth-watering meal with what is left in the icebox as well as applying unusual housewife remedies to salvage some of Chloe's cooking. The meal is prepared just in time for the arrival of Mr. Smudge, boss and customer. Chloe greets the guests as Smith whispers to Smudge, \\"Psst, your cook left this morning.\\" Smudge's countenance drastically changes and is now in a dither about dinner; he knows how Chloe cooks. Smudge is surprised by the quality and taste of the courses Chloe has presented to him and his guests. Smith interjects that the entire course only cost Smudge a grand total of $2.83. As Penny secretly sneaks away, Smith also lies to Smudge saying Chloe cooked the entire meal herself. Of course, Chloe emphatically nods in agreement, much to her dog's disbelief.

Completed and consecrated in 1852, it is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. Numerous renovations have enlarged and changed some aspects of the cathedral, but it remains essentially the same since its construction. History Interior Large numbers of Catholics started to arrive in the Western Reserve region of Ohio in the 1830s and were served by visiting priests sent north by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. A small group of Irish settlers established St. Mary's of the Flats in 1826. The congregation met in several locations before beginning construction on its own sanctuary in 1837. When Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Cleveland in 1847, he named Louis Amadeus Rappe as its first bishop. Bishop Rappe established St. John's Cathedral on Superior Street and Erie Street (today's East 9th Street) on land purchased in 1845 by St. Mary's pastor Rev. Peter McLaughlin. He selected architect Patrick Keely, who designed the building in an ornamental gothic style and the Bishop laid the cornerstone October 22, 1848. Until the new building was completed in 1852, St. Mary's served as cathedral for the diocese. At the time of its completion, the new cathedral was the well beyond Cleveland's Public Square. Alterations and additions began on the church almost as soon as the initial construction was complete. In 1857, a boys' school was added and within ten years, it was joined by a parish hall and girls' school. In 1879, the parish raised sufficient funds to complete interior and exterior decoration and add a spire. To fund the initial construction, Bishop Rappe was forced to seek donations from sources as far away as New York City and France. In 1884, the church interior was redecorated and stained glass windows were added along with walnut furnishings in the sanctuary and the windows were replaced again in 1902 with art glass windows from Munich. On August 20, 1920, the cathedral was the site of the funeral for famed baseball player Ray Chapman. Thousands gathered inside and around the cathedral for one of the largest funerals in the history of Cleveland. Chapman was a popular player that only days before was killed when hit in the head by a pitched baseball. He remains the only player to have been fatally injured during a Major League baseball game. In 1943, Archbishop Joseph Schrembs announced a plan to renovate the cathedral, but due to World War II the plan did not move forward until 1945. After World War II, Schremb's successor, Edward Francis Hoban continued Schrembs' plan. Construction began in 1946 when the old cathedral was enlarged and the brick exterior refaced in orange Tennessee Crab Ochard Sandstone. The architectural firm of Stickle, Kelly and Stickle oversaw construction which also included a new bell tower and interior decoration. However, the tower held no bells until 1988. John W. Winterich and Associates supervised creation of a new reredos and other interior decoration. The cathedral currently has seating for approximately 1,500 worshippers.‚Äô‚Äô, Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University The new cathedral contained several new chapels including The Resurrection Chapel, which holds the tombs of former bishops, and the relics of St. Christine of Calixtus (whose relics were discovered in the Catacombs of St. Calixtus outside of Rome), presented to Archbishop Scrembs by Pope Pius XI in 1925. Evidence shows that Christine was a girl of 13 or 14 who died for her faith around the year 300. In keeping with tradition of that time, she had been buried with a small glass vial of her blood, in testament of having given her life for the Faith as a martyr.StJohnCathedral.com‚Äô‚Äô, Website of the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, Cleveland, Ohio. The 4368 pipe/72 rank organ constructed by the Holtkamp Organ Company of Cleveland that was installed during the renovation still serves the church today. The organ may be operated from a console in the loft or another behind the cathedra. On September 4, 1948, Archbishop Hoban with Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York City celebrated a Mass to mark the renovation of St. John's Cathedral. The renovation added a structure to house St. John's College. St. John's later merged with Ursuline College and the building was demolished to construct the Eaton Center in 1981. In 1964, St. John's added a dormitory tower which was later remodeled to house Diocesan offices. In 2007, the Diocese relocated its offices and this was demolished to create a parking lot for the burgeoning Avenue District around St. Clair Avenue and East 12th Street. A parking garage was built nearby to accommodate parishioners. In 1977, Bishop James Hickey carried out additional renovations due to Vatican II reforms. The altar was moved west from the apse to its current location in the crossing. This is approximately where the altar of the original cathedral stood. Parishioners raised funds in 1988 to install bells in the tower that was added during the 1946-48 renovation. The six bells range from to and are named for saints and blesseds who played a role in US history. The bells first rang to celebrate the Christmas Masses in 1988. In 1996, Cleveland's Italian American community provided funds to renovate the sacristy in celebration of Bishop Anthony Pilla's election as President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1995. In 1997, the Diocese celebrated its 150th anniversary. That year ABC-TV produced a special on celebrating Christ's splendor at the cathedral. Bishop Pilla dedicated a Holy Door in 2000 as part of the Holy Year proclaimed by Pope John Paul II. In 2002, the cathedral renovated its flagpole and rededicated it on September 11, 2002, one year after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2006, Bishop Pilla retired and Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Richard Lennon of Boston as 10th Bishop of Cleveland. In November 2016, Bishop Lennon sent a request to Pope Francis for early retirement due to declining health. On December 28, 2016, Pope Francis accepted his resignation as bishop. That same day, Pope Francis named Daniel Edward Thomas, the Bishop of the Diocese of Toledo, as Apostolic Administrator of the diocese. On July 11, 2017 Pope Francis named Nelson Jesus Perez, Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, as the 11th Bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland. He was officially installed as Bishop on September 5, 2017.

The Semantic Web is a collaborative movement led by international standards body the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standard promotes common data formats on the World Wide Web. By encouraging the inclusion of semantic content in web pages, the Semantic Web aims at converting the current web, dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents into a \\"web of data\\". The Semantic Web stack builds on the W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF).  Overview  The Semantic Web Stack is an illustration of the hierarchy of languages, where each layer exploits and uses capabilities of the layers below. It shows how technologies that are standardized for Semantic Web are organized to make the Semantic Web possible. It also shows how Semantic Web is an extension (not replacement) of classical hypertext web. The illustration was created by Tim Berners-Lee. The stack is still evolving as the layers are concretized. (Note: A humorous talk on the evolving Semantic Web stack was given at the 2009 International Semantic Web Conference by James_Hendler.)  Semantic Web technologies  As shown in the Semantic Web Stack, the following languages or technologies are used to create Semantic Web. The technologies from the bottom of the stack up to OWL are currently standardized and accepted to build Semantic Web applications. It is still not clear how the top of the stack is going to be implemented. All layers of the stack need to be implemented to achieve full visions of the Semantic Web. = Hypertext Web technologies = The bottom layers contain technologies that are well known from hypertext web and that without change provide basis for the semantic web. * Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), generalization of URI, provides means for uniquely identifying semantic web resources. Semantic Web needs unique identification to allow provable manipulation with resources in the top layers. * Unicode serves to represent and manipulate text in many languages. Semantic Web should also help to bridge documents in different human languages, so it should be able to represent them. * XML is a markup language that enables creation of documents composed of semi-structured data. Semantic web gives meaning (semantics) to semi-structured data. * XML Namespaces provides a way to use markups from more sources. Semantic Web is about connecting data together, and so it is needed to refer more sources in one document. = Standardized Semantic Web technologies = Middle layers contain technologies standardized by W3C to enable building semantic web applications. * Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for creating statements in a form of so-called triples. It enables to represent information about resources in the form of graph - the semantic web is sometimes called Giant Global Graph. * RDF Schema (RDFS) provides basic vocabulary for RDF. Using RDFS it is for example possible to create hierarchies of classes and properties. * Web Ontology Language (OWL) extends RDFS by adding more advanced constructs to describe semantics of RDF statements. It allows stating additional constraints, such as for example cardinality, restrictions of values, or characteristics of properties such as transitivity. It is based on description logic and so brings reasoning power to the semantic web. * SPARQL is a RDF query language - it can be used to query any RDF-based data (i.e., including statements involving RDFS and OWL). Querying language is necessary to retrieve information for semantic web applications. * RIF is a rule interchange format. It is important, for example, to allow describing relations that cannot be directly described using description logic used in OWL. = Unrealized Semantic Web technologies = Top layers contain technologies that are not yet standardized or contain just ideas that should be implemented in order to realize Semantic Web. * Cryptography is important to ensure and verify that semantic web statements are coming from trusted source. This can be achieved by appropriate digital signature of RDF statements. * Trust to derived statements will be supported by (a) verifying that the premises come from trusted source and by (b) relying on formal logic during deriving new information. * User interface is the final layer that will enable humans to use semantic web applications.

Located from Oslo Central Station, it is served by line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. It is located in a residential area and has four regular hourly services operated by the Norwegian State Railways. The station features two accessible side platforms and an underpass. There are five tracks, three of which are used for turnaround, parking and splitting of trains. The station, designed by Georg Andreas Bull, opened on 1 May 1874, two years after the line. It received major upgrade from 1917 to 1922, when an all-new station building and island platform were built, while the railway was doubled, electrified and gauge converted to standard gauge. This gave a thirty-minuted headway to Oslo and Sandvika. H√∏vik was manned until 1995. It received a new upgrade in 2013 and 2014, when the buildings were demolished and new tracks installed. History The original station during the 1870s The Drammen Line past the site of H√∏vik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom: 189 The railway station serving H√∏vik opened on 1 May 1874.Bjerke & Holom: 192 It was the first railway station between Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station. The new means of transport allowed the H√∏vik area to develop as a suburban residential area allowing commuters to travel to the capital.Wisting: 62 The original station building was a standard design by Georg Andreas Bull used for most stations along the Drammen Line.Hartmann: 125 In addition to a station building it featured a Narvesen kiosk.Wisting: 76 A spur to load cars with compost and garbage was installed in 1908.Wisting: 18 B√¶rum Municipality established a public library for H√∏vik in 1911. From their establishment to 1924 they were located next to the station building.Wisting: 25 The line from Sandvika to Oslo was substantially upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at H√∏vik and standard gauge traffic was carried out on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All‚Äìstandard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922.Bjerke & Holom: 196 An interlocking system was installed on 6 October 1924. The second station during the 1920s The upgrades also resulted in new station buildings on the double tracked sections, which were designed by NSB Arktitektkontor.Hartmann: 85 Architect for the station was Ragnvald Utne. These were the first stations in Norway designed for double-track operations and were designed in Baroque Revival architecture. As the others it featured an island platform. H√∏vik was in this series unusual in that it was not built as an elevation station and instead had the station located on the platform. The old station building was moved to Spikkestad Station.Bjerke & Holom: 193 The new station building opened on 22 February 1922. The main floor featured a common office for the station master, signaling control, telegraphy and ticket sales, a room for cargo handling and a waiting room for passengers. The station master's apartment in the upper story consisted of four rooms and a kitchen. However, it had limited space due to roof angles and steep stairs. There was also a cargo building on the platform and the station featured six tracks at the time. In 1926 the station was manned by a station master, a clerk, a switcher, five telegraphists, six station workers and a journeyman. From 1922 a half- hour headway was introduced on the local trains between Sandvika and Oslo West Station. Two more stations in the H√∏vik area opened on 1 November 1931.Wisting: 63 By building Strand Station and Ramstad Station, the number of local bus routes could be reduced. They would remain in service until August 1978. H√∏vik Station received centralized traffic control on 3 December 1992 and became unmanned on 15 January 1995. The opening of the B√¶rum Tunnel, the second phase of the Asker Line, 26 August 2011, meant that express and regional trains bypassed H√∏vik Station all together and run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika. As part of the Asker Line project, Lysaker Station was upgraded, allowing the Norwegian State Railways to terminate more of their trains there instead of at Sk√∏yen Station. The work on Lysaker Station was completed in August 2011, but because of there was no capacity to turn around trains at Lysaker, the increased capacity was placed on hold until December 2014. This required that a new site to turn around trains was found. H√∏vik was one of several locations proposed and was preferred due to the availability of space combined to the vicinity to Lysaker. While the new turnaround tracks are being built, the project allows for the full upgrade of the station area to modern standards. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration also carried out some construction work regarding the road network in the area. The project, estimated to cost 652 million, includes a full upgrade to all infrastructure on the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Sandvika. In addition to H√∏vik, Stabekk Station and Blommenholm Station were modernized. Skanska won the contract to build the new H√∏vik Station. To carry out efficient construction work, the segment of track was closed and all trains diverted via the B√¶rum Tunnel from 7 April 2013 to 13 December 2014. The upgrades saw the demolition of the station building. In addition of sound shields were built along the sides of the tracks. However, the signaling system, built by Thales Rail Signalling Solutions, was delayed. The upgrades freed up track capacity allowing the number of trains to increase from two to four per direction per hour. Facilities Class 71 train of the Airport Express Train passing through H√∏vik Station. These trains do not serve the station, but prior to 2011 operated as a passing train on the section of the Drammen Line. H√∏vik Station is situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station at an elevation of . The station features five tracks. Two of these are located on each their side platform, serving trains in each direction. The platforms are long and tall, providing universally accessibility. The center three tracks are used for parking, turning and splitting of trains. There is an underpass on the eastern end of the station, which provides access between the platforms and to the streets on each side. Both platforms are available by elevator. On the south side of the station there are bicycle parking, park and ride and kiss and ride facilities with immediate access to European Road E18. There is capacity for 95 bicycles and 77 cars, including 3 disabled parking spaces, 5 charging stations for electric cars and a taxi stand. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves H√∏vik with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Spikkestad Station along the Spikkestad Line to Asker Station and past H√∏vik to Oslo Central Station. It then continues along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m Station. H√∏vik has four trains per direction per hour. The station had about 400 daily passengers in 2008.

The station features an island platform accessible from the station building on the south side. The station opened on 10 May 1910, following the construction of housing in the vicinity. It received major upgrade from 1917 to 1922, when an all-new station building and the railway was doubled, electrified and gauge converted to standard gauge. This gave a thirty-minuted headway to Oslo and Sandvika. Blommenholm was manned until 1969 and previously featured a post office. History The Drammen Line past the site of Blommenholm Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom: 189 During the planning of the Drammen Line there was a disagreement of the route through Blommenholm. The owner of the eponymous farm wanted the tracks to run on the north side of his farm, but this demand was not met.Lindemann: 66 Demands for a station were put forward by Christian Homan. He had bought the farm of Blommenholm with the intent of selling the land for residential development.L√∏ken: 153 The new residents at first used Sandvika Station and H√∏vik Station. However, the roads were poor and it was not uncommon to ski to the station during the winter. To ensure better means of transport for his new residential area, Homan started working to convince the Norwegian State Railways that they should build a station to serve Blommenholm. Homan offered free land and 25,000 Norwegian krone and the railway company agreed to build the station in what became the first major case for the new residents' association.L√∏ken: 154 The original station building opened on 10 May 1910. The station, situated on the north side, only had single track and narrow gauge. Originally there were only three trains per day per direction which stopped at Blommenholm. However, they would only stop intermediately at H√∏vik before running directly to Oslo West Station. The line from Sandvika to Oslo was substantially upgraded between 1917 and 1922.

This caused protests from the residents' association and NSB decided to terminate them in 1929.L√∏ken: 127 Blommenholm was downgraded to a halt on 1 February 1969 and was subsequently no longer manned. A major upgrade to the service came in 1973. New Class 69 trains were put into service. Along with the closing of some stations, it allowed travel time to Oslo to drop from 22 to 12 minutes. During this period the station was repeatedly subject to vandalism, especially the breaking of the windows. In 1983 NSB went to the step of rebuilding the platform building so it became a shed without windows.Lindemann: 67 The line past Blommenholm received centralized traffic control and automatic train stop on 3 December 1992.

Subsequently, the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Sandvika was upgraded. While this involved a full replacement of the superstructure and renovations of H√∏vik Station and Stabekk Station, there was not sufficient funding to complete Blommenholm. Therefore, unlike the other two stations, Blommenholm did not receive universally accessible platforms. However, the underpass was modernized.

Name  They are mentioned as Coriosolitas (var. Coriosolitos, Curiosolitas) and Coriosolites by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 2:34; 3:7:4; 7:75:4 and as Coriosvelites by Pliny (1st c. AD).Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:18 , entry 1002b. The meaning of the name Coriosolites is uncertain. The first element is certainly the Gaulish word corios ('army'), but the interpretation of is unclear. It could stem from the Gaulish root s≈´li- ('[good] sight'; cf. Old Irish s√∫il, 'sight', Brittonic Sulis), with corio-soli-tes as the 'troop-watchers' or 'those who watch over the troop'. A concurrent etymology is the root solitu- ('purchase/salary of mercenaries'; cf. Gaulish soldurio < 'body-guard, loyal, devoted'; Old Breton solt 'sou, solidus'), with curio-solit-es as 'those who purchase soldiers or mercenaries'. The city of Corseul, attested as civitas Coriosolitum ca. 400 AD ('civitas of the Curiosolites', Aecclesia Corsult ca. 869, Corsout in 1288) is named after the Gallic tribe. The ancient Corseul is generally identified with the settlement of Fanum Martis ('temple of Mars') mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana (5th c. AD). Due to the lack of early epigraphic record, however, the original Gaulish name of the town remains unknown.

G. vii. 75. Pliny mentions them with the Unelli, Diablindi, and Rhedones. = Settlements = The ancient settlement of Corseul was most likely established ex nihilo by the Roman authorities during the reign of Augustus, as the capital of the civitas Coriosolitum. It reached at size of 47ha in the first centuries of the Common Era. Around 340 AD, the capital of the civitas was moved to Aleth (Saint-Servan), situated on the coast.

Medical uses Vorapaxar is used for persons with a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or persons with peripheral arterial disease. Studies have shown that this medication can reduce the rate of combined endpoint cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization. Contraindications Vorapaxar is contraindicated for people with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage. In studies of vorapaxar on persons with prior ischemic stroke, there was an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage without an improvement in major vascular events. Vorapaxar possesses a long half life which is a problem because there is currently no treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effects of vorapaxar. Because of this, it is important that vorapaxar not be used in persons with history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracranial hemorrhage, or active pathological bleeding. This family of medication, PAR-1 antagonists in general has been associated with an increased risk of intracranial bleeding demonstrated by a pooled analysis of data that studied 42000 patients with history of thrombotic vascular disease or acute coronary syndrome comparing the medication and a placebo.Morrow, David A., and Mark J. Alberts. \\"Efficacy and Safety of Vorapaxar in Patients With Prior Ischemic Stroke.\\" Journal of the American Heart Association (2013): 691-98. American Heart Association. Web. 2 Nov. 2014. . Drug interactions Vorapaxar is eliminated primarily by metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes. It is best to avoid any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors(ex: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan). CYP3A4 inducers(Carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and Phenytoin) should also be avoided. Dose adjustment No dose adjustment is required in persons with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required in persons with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. If the person has severe hepatic impairment, vorapaxar is not recommended due to the risk of bleeding. Mechanism of Action Vorapaxar is a new anti- platelet drug that is part of the PAR-1 antagonist family, a new class of anti-platelet drug. It functions by inhibiting thrombin-related platelet aggregation. This mechanism works by a different pathway than other anti- platelet medications such as aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors. Unlike many other medication, vorapaxar does not affect ADP-mediated platelet aggregation, coagulation parameters, or bleeding time. Storage Vorapaxar can be stored at 20-25 ¬∞C(68-77 ¬∞F). It is best to store vorapaxar in original packaging with the bottle tightly closed and to avoid moisture. History In January 2011, clinical trials being conducted by Merck were halted for patients with stroke and mild heart conditions due to an increase in brain bleedings.Merck Blood Thinner Studies Halted in Select Patients, Bloomberg News, January 13, 2011 In a randomized double-blinded trial comparing vorapaxar with placebo in addition to standard therapy in 12,944 patients who had acute coronary syndromes, there was no significant reduction in a composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia with rehospitalization, or urgent coronary revascularization. However, there was increased risk of major bleeding. A trial published in February 2012, found no change in all cause mortality while decreasing the risk of cardiac death and increasing the risk of major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhages. After two years, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of the study treatment in people with a history of stroke owing to the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. TRA 2¬∞P‚ÄìTIMI 50 study of vorapaxar was carried out in patients who had previously experienced a heart attack, stroke, or who had peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In this three-year study in over 26,000 patients, the addition of vorapaxar to standard of care (aspirin and/or an ADP antagonist such as clopidogrel) significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or urgent coronary revascularization by 12 percent compared to placebo plus standard of care (11.2 percent vs. 12.4 percent, p = 0.001). Vorapaxar showed the most promising result among patients with a history of heart attack. Among these patients the drug reduced the relative risk of CV death, heart attack or stroke by 20 percent. There was an increase in moderate or severe bleeding, but no statistically significant increase in fatal bleeding. Vorapaxar was recommended for FDA approval on January 15, 2014. On May 5, 2014, vorapaxar obtained FDA approval.

History The park is the site of the Willamette Mission, established in 1834 by Jason Lee, who traveled to the area to convert Native Americans in the Oregon Country to Christianity. The missionaries built a one- room house that served as a school, chapel, hospital, and living quarters. They later added onto the house and built a barn. In September 1837, more missionaries arrived and built a blacksmith shop, granary, and a hospital, and a building that doubled as a school and a dining hall; the ensuing settlement became known as Mission Bottom. The mission later moved in 1840 to Salem (known then as Chemeketa). In a flood in 1861, the mission site was extensively damaged, and the Willamette River changed its course. The mission site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Willamette Station Site, Methodist Mission in Oregon\\". A \\"ghost structure\\" marks the location of the mission.

The Kidron Valley and Mount of Olives are in the background. The Ophel ( ‚Äò≈çpÃÑel), also Graecised to Ophlas,Lightfoot, John. 2007. From the Talmud and Hebraica, Vol. 1 (reprint). New York, New York: Cosimo. p. 62. Freedman, David Noel; editor. 2000. Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., p. 990. is the biblical name apparently given to a certain part of a settlement or city that is elevated from its surroundings, and probably means fortified hill or risen area. In the Hebrew Bible the Ophel refers to a specific part in two cities: the extended City of David (the oldest part of Jerusalem), as in the Book of Chronicles and the Book of Nehemiah (, ), and at Samaria, the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Israel, mentioned in the Second Book of Kings (). The Mesha Stele, written in Moabite, a Canaanite language closely related to Biblical Hebrew, is the only extra- biblical source using the word, also in connection to a fortified place. Meaning of the term Ophel, with the definite article ha-ophel, is a common noun known from two Ancient Semitic languages, Biblical Hebrew and Moabitic. As a place name or description it appears several times in the Hebrew Bible and once on the Mesha Stele from Moab. There is no ultimate agreement as to its exact meaning, and scholars have long been trying to deduce it from the different contexts it appears in. When used as a common noun, it has been translated as \\"tumors\\" (), and in a verbal form it was taken to mean \\"puffed up\\" (), this indicating that the root might be associated with \\"swelling\\". When referring to a place, it seems from the context to mean either hill, or fortified place, or a mixture of the two, i.e., a fortified hill, and by considering the presumed meaning of the root, it might signify a \\"bulging or rounded\\" fortification. Biblical verses in which it has been translated either as \\"fortified place \\" (tower, citadel, stronghold etc.) or \\"hill\\" are , , , , and . On the Mesha Stele, named for the king of Moab who erected it, Mesha says: \\"I built Q-R-CH-H (Karhah?), the wall of ye'arim [forests], and the wall of ophel and I built its gates and I built its towers.\\" Here ophel is commonly translated as \\"citadel\\". Jerusalem Ophel =Hebrew Bible= The location of the Ophel of the Hebrew Bible is easy to make out from the references from and : it was on the eastern ridge, which descends south of the Temple, and probably near the middle of it. In current terms, the still extant Herodian cased-in Temple Mount is bordered to the south by a saddle, followed by the ridge in case, also known as the southeastern hill, which stretches down to the King's Garden and the (lower) Siloam Pool. If the Ophel was, as it seems, close to its centre, the use of the term \\"Ophel ridge\\" for the entire southeastern hill including the saddle, seems to be wrong. Two kings of Judah, Jotham and Manasseh, are described to have massively strengthened the fortifications at \\"Ophel\\" (), leading to the conclusion that this must have been an area of great strategic importance, and either very close to or identical with the \\"stronghold of Zion\\" conquered and reused by King David (). =Josephus' \\"Ophlas\\"= Josephus, writing about the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì70 CE), uses the Graecised form \\"Ophlas\\", and places it slightly higher up the eastern ridge from the First Temple-period Ophel, touching the \\"eastern cloister of the temple\\" (Jewish Wars, V, iv, 2 The Wars Of The Jews, Book V, Chapter IV, paragraph 2. At sacred-texts.com ) and in the context of \\"the temple and the parts thereto adjoining, .... and the .... 'Valley of the Cedron'\\" (Jewish Wars, V, iv, 1 The Wars Of The Jews, Book V, Chapter IV, paragraph 1. At sacred-texts.com ). This takes us to the area of the saddle right next to the southeast corner of Herod's Temple Mount. =Benjamin and Eilat Mazar's \\"Ophel\\"= Benjamin Mazar and Eilat Mazar have excavated in the area between Herod's boxed-in Temple Mount and what is known as the City of David, consisting mainly of a saddle between the Southern Wall of Herod's Temple and the steep ridge of the City of David, and have termed this area \\"Ophel\\". The term is commonly used by archaeologists with this meaning.Daniel K. Eisenbud, Ophel Excavation Director Discusses Biblical Discoveries, Temple Mount, The Jerusalem Post, 26 February 2018, accessed 27 July 2019 Since c. 2000, Eilat Mazar has renewed excavation work in the Ophel area. Notable structures found during these excavations include architectural remains and a variety of movable objects, some dated to the First Temple period, many to the Second Temple period, as well as the Byzantine and Early Muslim periods, the latter including major findings from the Umayyad and Fatimid periods. Here a few selected findings: Canaanite or First Temple period * The Ophel inscription. It is a 3000 years old pottery shard, which bears the earliest alphabetical inscription found in Jerusalem. It was discovered during Eilat Mazar's renewed excavation. First Temple period * Remains interpreted by archaeologist Eilat Mazar to be a 70 or 79 metres long segment of city wall including a gatehouse leading to a royal structure, and a watchtower overlooking the Kidron Valley. Eilat Mazar believes these are the remains of the fortifications that, according to the biblical First Book of Kings, once encompassed the city. Eilat Mazar, who re-excavated the remains in 2010, believes them to date to the late 10th century BCE, associating them with King Solomon, which is controversial and not supported by past and contemporary archaeologists. Biblical reference: According to , King Solomon \\"took Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building ... the wall around Jerusalem.\\" (New Revised Standard Version). The dig: The excavation work was a joint project of Hebrew University, in cooperation with the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, and the East Jerusalem Development Company, with funding provided by Jewish American couple, Daniel Mintz and Meredith Berkman.Weddings: Meredith Berkman, Daniel Mintz. New York Times, 3 November 1996. Dating of the wall: Although consensus on the dating of the wall has not been reached by the archaeological community, Mazar maintains that, \\"It's the most significant construction we have from First Temple days in Israel,\\" and \\"It means that at that time, the 10th century (BCE), in Jerusalem there was a regime capable of carrying out such construction.\\" The 10th century is the period the Bible describes as the reign of King Solomon. Claiming that broken pottery in the \\"royal structure\\" enabled the team to date the building. One storage jar bears an inscription in Hebrew. Mazar told the Jerusalem Post that \\"The jars that were found are the largest ever found in Jerusalem,\\" and \\"the inscription found on one of them shows that it belonged to a government official, apparently the person responsible for overseeing the provision of baked goods to the royal court.\\" Aren Maeir, an archeology professor at Bar Ilan University said he has yet to see evidence that the fortifications are as old as Mazar claims. Whilst acknowledging that 10th century remains have been found in Jerusalem, he describes proof of a strong, centralized kingdom at that time as \\"tenuous\\". Structural features: A section of wall long and high has been uncovered. The discoveries include an inner gatehouse, a \\"royal structure\\" and a corner tower with a base measuring by from which watchmen could keep watch on the Kidron Valley. According to Mazar, the built structures are similar to the First Temple era fortifications of Megiddo, Beersheba and Ashdod. Mazar told reporters that \\"A comparison of this latest finding with city walls and gates from the period of the First Temple, as well as pottery found at the site,\\" enable her to \\"postulate, with a great degree of assurance\\" that the wall dates form the late 10th-century BCE. Mazar told reporters that \\"A comparison of this latest finding with city walls and gates from the period of the First Temple, as well as pottery found at the site, enable us to postulate, with a great degree of assurance, that the wall that has been revealed is that which was built by King Solomon in Jerusalem in the latter part of the tenth century BCE.\\" Previous excavations: The wall has been excavated twice before, once in the 1860s and again in the 1980s. In 1867 Charles Warren conducted an underground survey in the area, describing the outline of a large tower but without attributing it to the era of Solomon. Criticism of approach: Israel Finkelstein and other archaeologists from Tel Aviv University have flagged concern that, with reference to her 2006 dating of the \\"Solomonic city wall\\" in the area to the south of the Temple Mount known as the Ophel, > The biblical text dominates this field operation, not archaeology. Had it > not been for Mazar's literal reading of the biblical text, she never would > have dated the remains to the 10th century BCE with such confidence.

She was the only child of Count Henry IV and his second wife, Agnes of Guelders. Life Prior to her birth, her aging father Henry had recognized his nephew, Count Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut as his heir presumptive. However, the 72-year-old count fathered a daughter, Ermesinde, who displaced Baldwin as heir presumptive. Upon Henry's death in 1197, a war of succession inevitably took place. At its end, it was decided that Count Henry's fiefs would be split: Baldwin would have Namur, Ermesinde would have Durbuy and La Roche, and Luxembourg would revert to their common liege, the Holy Roman Emperor. Emperor Henry VI then gave the fief to his brother Otto I, Count of Burgundy. Ermesinde was initially betrothed to Henry II of Champagne, but the engagement was cancelled in 1189. Instead her first husband was Theobald I of Bar.P. P√©port√©, Historiography, Collective Memory and Nation- Building in Luxembourg, (Brill, 2011), 109-110. He successfully negotiated with Philip of Namur and his brother Baldwin for renunciation of Luxembourg, thus making Theobald and Ermesinde the Count and Countess of Luxembourg.John A. Gade, Luxemburg in the Middle Ages, (Brill, 1951), 74-75. When Theobald died in 1214, Ermesinde married Waleran III, Count of Limburg (1180‚Äì1226), who would rule as the Count of Luxembourg. In 1223 Ermesinde and Waleran pressed their claim to Namur against Margrave Philip II, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Ermesinde granting charters of freedom to the city of Echternach After Waleran's death, Ermesinde ruled Luxembourg alone for two decades. She proved to be an effective administrator, granting charters of freedom to several towns and increasing the prosperity of her country. Grave Legend has it that the Countess was one day walking in the area around her castle, near Eischen. There she saw a woman coming down from a hill, who had in her arms a child that was wrapped in sheepskin, on which was a black cross. The Countess was convinced that this was the Virgin Mary, and therefore planned the construction on this spot of the abbey that would later become the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Clairefontaine. In her will she asked that she be buried at this location. The Abbey of Clairefontaine was in fact only built by her son, Henry V.P. P√©port√©, Historiography, Collective Memory and Nation-Building in Luxembourg, 115. After many years, the abbey was destroyed in the late 18th century by French troops. The Jesuits then reconstructed a part of it from 1875 to 1877, including the old chapel. During these works, the Jesuit Martin Paul on 11 May 1875 found a gravestone, along with human remains. Next to the skeleton was a plaque with the inscription: \\"Voici les precious ossements de la tr√®s Illustre et Pieuse Princesse Ermesinde, Comtesse Souveraine de Luxembourg et de Namur. Notre heureuse fondatrice que Dieu Glorifie et sans fin B√©nisse\\" (Here lie the precious remains of the very Illustrious and Pious Princess Ermesinde, Sovereign Countess of Luxembourg and Namur. Our founder whom God Glorifies and forever Blesses\\") In 1747, shortly before the old abbey was destroyed by the French, the nuns had hidden Ermesinde's remains here. Currently, the remains are in the crypt of the chapel of Clairefontaine.  Children  The children of Ermesinde and her first husband, Theobald I of Bar, were: * Renaud (died before 1214), Seigneur of Briey * Elisabeth (died 1262), married Val√©ran of Limburg, Lord of Monschau * Margaret (d?), first married Hugh III, Count of Vaud√©mont (died 1243); later married Henry of Bois, regent of Vaud√©mont.

The appeal to fund the service was launched in the summer of 2000 by top jockey Frankie Dettori, who had been a casualty in a serious plane crash a couple of months earlier. When flying commenced in January 2001, the service was initially available only one day a week. The East Anglian Air Ambulance now operates two helicopters, 365 days a year, from its bases at Cambridge Airport and Norwich Airport, covering over and a population of approximately 3.5 million. Mission EAAA's mission statement is: \\"To alleviate suffering and save lives, by the rapid delivery of specialist clinicians and equipment to accidents and medical emergencies and the subsequent transfer of patients to and between hospitals\\". The charity provides air ambulance cover for East Anglia, in association with East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which provides highly skilled critical care paramedics who fly with the charity. Doctors are seconded from their home NHS trusts.  Aircraft  EAAA's first aircraft was a Bolkow 105, commissioned from Sterling Aviation. The aircraft was based at Norwich Airport and had the call sign 'Anglia One'. In June 2006, a new helicopter, a MBB/Kawasaki BK 117, G-OEMT, was commissioned from Sterling Aviation. The aircraft replaced the Bolkow 105, G-EYNL, and went into service as Anglia One. In August 2007 and second MBB/Kawasaki BK 117, G-RESC, went into service with EAAA as Anglia Two. In March 2011, EAAA changed operator and moved from Sterling Aviation to interim supplier, Bond Air Services. Bond later successfully tendered for the contract to operate Anglia One and Anglia Two. During the interim period EAAA flew red aircraft but soon returned to their more familiar yellow livery with the introduction of the Eurocopter EC135. In 2012, EAAA commissioned the fully night-capable EC135 T2e and commenced the CAA approval process to begin the night HEMS service. In April 2015, EAAA received a new Eurocopter EC145 T2 helicopter, based at Cambridge Airport. The introduction of the EC145T2 provides EAAA with a helicopter that is capable of carrying two flight crew, three clinicians and a patient, with increased cabin space and performance. In February 2016, a second EC145 T2, G-RESU went into service as Anglia Two. The new aircraft replaces the EC135 T2e, G-HEMN at Norwich. Both aircraft are fitted with medical equipment and are dedicated ambulance helicopters. Anglia One covers Norfolk and Suffolk and is based at Norwich Airport. Anglia Two covers Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire and is based at Cambridge Airport, although both can and do fly further afield when required.  Operations  When the service was first launched, Anglia One operated for only one day a week. This was soon expanded to five days a week and later to the current service of seven days a week. Anglia Two was launched in August 2007 and began operating five days a week (from Sunday to Thursday). The service provided by Anglia Two was extended to seven days a week in 2008. It was manned by the Emergency Medical Team from Magpas Helimedix 24/7, based at RAF Wyton until its move to Cambridge Airport where the charity decided to use its own medical personnel - predominantly doctors specialising in emergency medicine, anaesthesia and/or intensive care medicine from hospitals within the region. Airbus Helicopters H145 completed its first HEMS mission with EAAA on 2 April 2015. This aircraft now operates as Anglia Two at Cambridge Airport Typical incidents for which the assistance of the air ambulance is requested include road traffic collisions, horse riding accidents, cardiac arrests and serious falls. The EAAA team of highly skilled doctors and critical care paramedics also treat many people injured in agricultural, industrial and sporting accidents as well as medical emergencies. Airlifted patients are most likely to go to the major trauma centre at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, the specialist burns unit in Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford or the specialist heart attack centre at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. Patients less severely injured, but where travel would take an excessive amount of time, may be airlifted to their local A&E; with trauma unit. In May 2013, EAAA received approval to fly night time HEMS missions. The first team was available and ready to fly on 24 May and was called that night to a traffic collision in Essex. The clinicians were flown to the scene where they treated an injured motorcyclist with the aid of night vision equipment. The patient was then flown back to Cambridge where he was taken to the major trauma centre at Addenbrooke's Hospital. In 2018, the charity appeared on the Channel 4 TV programme Emergency Helicopter Medics, which follows the crews responding and treating emergency patients.  Aircrew  For the majority of call-outs Anglia One and Two will carry a crew of four; one pilot, one co-pilot, one critical-care paramedic and one doctor. The EAAA crew with their expertise and training are able to 'take the hospital emergency room to the patient'. The speed in which EAAA helicopters can get the medics to people suffering a medical emergency or accident is critical in ensuring a good recovery for the patient. EAAA can provide at the scene of the incident just about all the procedures that would be expected in a hospital. For that reason, once the EAAA doctor and paramedic crew have treated the patient, it is often safe for them to then travel on to the hospital by road for further treatment. EAAA fly approximately a third of their patients and this is either because of the critical nature of their condition or the remoteness of the incident.  Control decision  The EAAA control centre is located in Chelmsford and is staffed twenty four hours a day, every day of the year by an East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust dispatcher and a critical care paramedic. They know what to look for in an emergency call and can ensure that the helicopter is mobilised when its life saving services are required. The decision is made by the doctor at the scene of the incident as to whether the patient should go by land ambulance, or be flown to hospital on the air ambulance.  Finances  The East Anglian Air Ambulance is a charitable service and does not receive direct funding from the government. It is estimated that it costs in the region of ¬£11million per year to keep both helicopters and the service operational; this money comes entirely from public donations and fundraising activities, including the purchase of weekly lottery tickets, corporate donations and legacy giving.  Facts and figures  * East Anglian Air Ambulance has attended over 22,000 life saving missions since the charity's first aircraft was launched in 2000 * The average cost of each mission flown as of 20142015 financial accounts is ¬£3,500 * The normal cruising speed for an EAAA helicopter is and they can reach anywhere in the region within 25 minutes * Prince William, Duke of Cambridge was a former pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance from 2015 to 2017  Pre-hospital care network in the East of England  This charity is one of many pre-hospital care providers in the East, which has an established trauma network ‚Äì the first to be fully operational in the UK.

Clean vocals are implemented again in a few songs, to a larger extent than on Nightmares, although not as prominently as in later releases. The album features a change in guitar tuning, from drop C (which was used on Nightmares) to drop B, for all tracks, except \\"Low\\", which features the same tuning as drop B, but with the low B tuned to F# (the bass string on an eight string guitar). Ruin was the first Architects album to feature new vocalist Sam Carter.

Failed embassy to Portugal (1684) Ok-khun Chamnan was a member of a first embassy to Portugal, which left Siam in March 1684. The Siamese embassy was accompanying a returning Portuguese embassy, which had been sent to Siam by king Pedro II. The embassy was also bearing presents for the King of France, Louis XIV, and was planning to send three ambassadors to visit him. The first leg of the trip was made on a Siamese ship, commanded by a Portuguese captain. In Goa, after waiting more than a year, the embassy sailed on a Portuguese ship, which was wrecked off Cape Agulhas on 27 April 1686. After a series of adventures, Chamnan made his way across the tip of Africa to join the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. After several months, the embassy returned east through Batavia and returned to Siam in September 1687. During his travels, Chamnan had learnt Portuguese, which predisposed him to further contacts with Western countries. Chamnan was present in Bangkok in October during the reception of the 1687 French embassy composed of five warships, led by Simon de la Loub√®re and Claude C√©beret du Boullay, director of the French East India Company. Embassy to France and Rome (1688) Ok-khun Chamnan was then a member of a mission of three Siamese mandarins dispatched to Louis XIV in France and Pope Innocent XI in Rome, by the Siamese King Narai in 1688. The two other envoys were Ok-khun Wiset Puban and Ok-muen Pipith Raja. They were followed three days later by three catechists from Tonkin, and five Siamese students sent to study at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand in Paris. The Siamese mission was accompanied by the Jesuit Father Guy Tachard and the French envoy extraordinary to Siam, Simon de la Loub√®re. They left Siam aboard the Gaillard on 3 January 1688. The Siamese embassy, with Father Guy Tachard meeting with Pope Innocent XI, 23 December 1688 After a first visit to Paris, during which they could not meet Louis XIV, they went to Rome. They met with the Pope on 23 December 1688, and again on 5 January 1689, for a farewell audience. Drawings of the Siamese envoys were made by the famous painter Carlo Maratta. In February 1689, the embassy was granted an audience with Louis XIV, and the treaty of commerce C√©beret had obtained in 1687 was ratified. Two weeks later a military treaty was signed, designating Fran√ßois d'Alesso, Marquis d'Eragny, as captain of the palace guard in Ayutthaya and inspector of French troops in Siam. During Chamnan‚Äôs time in Europe, he had also converted to Catholicismhttp://www.siamese- heritage.org/jsspdf/1991/JSS_086_0g_Smithies_SiameseMandarinsOnGrandTour.pdf. The embassy was returned to Siam by the six warship fleet of Abraham Duquesne- Guiton (nephew of the famous Abraham Duquesne) in 1690, but because of unfavourable winds the fleet was only able to go as far as Balassor, at the mouth of the Ganges, where they dropped the embassy. The embassy finally returned to Ayutthaya overland.

The Unelli and the rest submitted to Publius Licinius Crassus in 57 BC; but in 56 BC it was necessary to send a force again into the country of the Unelli, Curiosolitae, and Lexovii. Quintus Titurius Sabinus had the command of the three legions who were to keep the Unelli and their neighbours quiet. The commander of the Unelli was Viridovix, and he was also at the head of all the forces of the states which had joined the Unelli, among whom were the Aulerci Eburovices and the Lexovii. The force of Viridovix was very large, and he was joined by desperate men from all parts of Gallia, robbers and those who were 'too idle to till the ground'. The Roman general entrenched himself in his camp, and made the Galli believe that he was afraid and was intending to slip away by night. The trick deceived the Galli, and they attacked the Roman camp, which was well placed on an eminence with a sloping ascent to it about a mile (1.6 km) in length. On the Galli reaching the Roman camp exhausted by a rapid march up the hill and encumbered with the fascines which they carried for filling up the ditch, the Romans sallied out by two gates and punished the enemy well for their temerity. They slaughtered an immense number of the Galli, and the cavalry pursuing the remainder let few escape. This feat of arms is told clearly in the Commentaries. The Unelli sent a contingent of 6000 men to attack Caesar at the siege of Alesia. (B. G. vii. 75.) Crociatonum became the civitas of the Unelli after the Roman conquest. It was given the name of Constantia in 298 AD during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus.

History The company was founded in 1932 in Rouen by Max Heilbronn, a son-in-law of Theophile Bader, the founder of Galeries Lafayette. In 1991, Monoprix acquired the Uniprix brand after Galeries Lafayette took over Nouvelles Galeries, the parent of Uniprix. In 1997, the chain merged with French retailer Prisunic, in a deal that saw Casino Group acquire a 21% stake in the merged company. In 2000, Galeries Lafayette, entered into an agreement to sell a 50% interest in Monoprix. Casino Group provided Galeries Lafayette with a put option to sell the remaining 50%. In 2012, after legal wrangling over the value of the put option, the shareholders of both firms agreed on a sale price of $1.6 billion (‚Ç¨1.2 billion). The Autorit√© de la concurrence, France's competition regulatory body, approved the transaction in 2013, with the condition that the merged group sell 58 stores. This allowed the deal to close, making Monoprix a wholly owned subsidiary of Casino Group. The Monoprix group had more than 300 stores and employed around 20,000 people in France at the end of 2008.Overview of the Monoprix group (in French) Monoprix is present in approximately 85% of all French towns with a population of more than 50,000.

Normally phone tapping was used to investigate serious crime or threats to the security of the state but the reverse happened in this case, Minister Noonan announced. History =Tapping= The phone tapping warrants were initiated by S√©an Doherty in discussion with Deputy Garda Commissioner Joseph Ainsworth. The phone of Bruce Arnold was tapped from May 10, 1982 to July 12 the same year. The application was stated to be for security purposes, with a departmental record claiming he was \\"anti-national\\". The phone of Geraldine Kennedy was tapped from July 28, 1982 to November 16 that year with a renewal on October 27 on the grounds that it was \\"yielding results\\". For the tap on Kennedys' phone a new category of \\"national security\\" was created for the warrant. Deputy Commissioner Ainsworth requested a complete set of transcripts on October 5, 1982. =Senior Garda figures= The incoming cabinet met on 18 and 19 January 1983 and an initial draft of a decision expressed loss of confidence in Garda Commissioner Patrick McLaughlin and Deputy Commissioner Thomas Joseph Ainsworth and that they considered removing them from office, though this was removed from the final draft. On 20 January 1983 the cabinet met again and noted the intentions of both Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to retire. =Findings by Deputy Commissioner Wren= Deputy Garda Commissioner Lawrence Wren found that neither Bruce Arnold or Geraldine Kennedy had been connected with criminal or subversive activities or people involved with same, that the request for the warrants had not come from the Garda√≠ but from then minister S√©an Doherty and that copies of the recordings had been supplied to minister Doherty. Resignation of Charles Haughey Nearly a decade after the scandal broke, Se√°n Doherty announced at a press conference that he had shown transcripts of recordings to Charles Haughey in 1982 while the latter was still Taoiseach. Until the press conference, Doherty had denied this. This led to Haughey's resignation as Taoiseach.Western People, The two sides of Sean Doherty, R.I.P.

Formed in 1938 by Victor Blick, the team survived the cessation of club rugby in Wales between 1939 and 1945, during the Second World War. There has been in existence at least two other clubs in Bridgend throughout the club's history providing local competition. The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and presently play in WRU Division 2 West Central.  1938 - The Beginning & Our Founder Victor Blick  Victor Blick came to Bridgend in the late 1920s as a post-man from Neath and he formed the Bridgend District Time Limit Cricket League in 1936 held at the Brewery Field. His greatest achievement was the foundation of Bridgend Sports Club which had a tremendous influence on local teenagers in the late 1930s and early 40s. One wet evening in 1938, sitting on the steps of the old Town Hall whilst waiting for the second house to start at the Embassy Cinema, he and his best mates, Trevor Davies and Roy Davies of Newcastle Hill, came to the opinion that there was room for another Rugby Club in the town. There was already Bridgend RFC and Bridgend Athletic (a different club to the present club. The new ‚ÄòAth‚Äô just took their name). Charlie Griffiths recalls ‚ÄúIt is quite remarkable looking back to see how quickly things developed from that inauspicious beginning‚Äù. For changing facilities, Victor obtained the use of stables at the back of Caedre Street (off Park Street), the bathing facilities there were three large tubs of water for each side. The stables were owned by the local vet and first treasurer Bryn Williams of St Marie Street recalls taking the rent to him on a monthly basis. By the end of 1938 showers were installed and the stables used as the Club House. The laws at this time made it difficult to play open rugby, but it was down to Victor Blick‚Äôs insistence on playing an open game, from the very beginning, that was responsible for the Sports playing the type of rugby we still appreciate today. Getting fixtures was no problem as sides wanted to play clubs with this sort of attitude. With the outbreak of World War 2 most rugby ceased, but somehow Victor managed to keep the Club alive by organising occasional fixtures against RAF St Athan and the Royal Ordnance Factory sides. With the cessation of the hostilities it was not too difficult for the Club to reform. In 1946 Victor organised the first tour to Devon where the Sports played Barnstable and Biddeford. It was a real success despite Victor asking for ¬£10 a head for the hotel. Of course no one paid that - a kings ransom at the time.  History  1938 - 1958 Victor Blick‚Äôs greatest achievement was the foundation of Bridgend Sports Club which had a tremendous influence on local teenagers in the late 1930s and early 40s. The late Charlie Griffiths recalled ‚ÄúIt is quite remarkable looking back to see how quickly things developed from that inauspicious beginning‚Äù. It was down to Victor Blick‚Äôs insistence on playing an open game that generations of Sports players derived so much pleasure over the years. The mid 1950s saw a great period of Sports Rugby with our only ‚ÄúInvincible‚Äù season to date, 1954-1955. Captained by the great Fred Gronow, who played the most games taking the field for 32 of the 35 matches. The team featured Derek Davies, who secured the record points tally with 90, Dennis Speck scored the most tries with 13, followed by Ron Meadows with 10 tries. Edwin Slade and Peter Wright joined the side and helped secure a finishing record of:- P35 W30 D5 L0. Truly Invincible! 1958 - 1978 This was the era in which the Sports built a side of great stature and skill. In 1959 the side with Clive Hathaway, Peter Wright and Brian Holl as well as Ashong and Greenslade won a Sevens competition in Scotland. The Club supplied players to Bridgend on a regular basis and won many Sevens competitions both in Wales, England and even in the USA. With a very strong fixture list built by Jack Braund, the Club chose to honour these fixtures rather than opt into the League system that was offered up by the WRU in the next decade. A decision that proved to be wrong as the leagues developed. 1978 - 1998 Building on that very strong team, the late 1970s and early 1980s saw three Silver Ball final Wins on the trot! A great achievement. Bridgend Sports were already causing ripples in the higher-archy of Welsh rugby. Quite simply we were the best. When the final decision to opt out of leagues happened we were placed in a much lower league than our status demanded. But the spirit of the Sports never faltered and over the next 10 years there was great loyalty and endeavour by both the players and the Committee as the Club looked to revive its status and develop a young growing Club. 1998 - 2018 When the Sports won the Division 5 league title we started that climb up the leagues that was planned. This in conjunction with the starting of a Mini and Junior section was to prove to be the best forward planning decision to date. The contribution by a number of key coaches in the past can not be over-stated and thanks go to Steve Rees, Mark Watts, Rhys Dowling, Roddy Boobyer, Keith Burke and Lyndon Griffiths. Successive captains have given these coaches 100% backing and that again is immeasurable so thanks to Punter, Norris, Wilson and Greg Thomas. 2018 - 2019 / The 80th Anniversary Season The Sports celebrated their 80th Season with a stellar year on the Pitch. The 1st XV were crowned Champions of WRU West Central 3 A on the last day of the season in front of just under 1000 supporters at the Bandstand by beating old rivals and league runners up Pyle RFC. The side also reached the semi final of the WRU Bowl losing a very close game to Oakdale RFC and reached the Final of the District Cup and the Presidents Cup. File:Sports WRU3A.jpgThe Sports 1st XV - WRU West Central 3A Champions 2018/2019 To appreciate what was achieved in our 80th Season these are the thoughts of the Coaches that Season Sean Donovan and Gareth David. \\"What a fantastic season and one I'm sure we will all remember and talk about for many years to come. The Cup run was something else, beating ‚ÄòThe Ath‚Äô. Winning away with the last kick of the game against Vardre. The two North Wales mini tours to Wrexham and Dolgellau which made up for us having to cancel our official tour to Belgium. The quarter final at home to Pontyclun and one of our best performances. Then to the Oakdale game in the Semi Final, where unfortunately we came second on the day, but standing there at the end and seeing all the support on the sidelines from under 7's all the way up to the senior generations was pretty humbling for all involved. Making it to the Principality Stadium would have been the icing on the cake but it wasn't meant to be. To go unbeaten for the rest of the season and maintaining an undefeated home record was pretty unbelievable when we look back at possibly the hardest run in any club from any division had. It all came down to that final day and a pretty brutal game against close rivals Pyle. Looking at comments going around I believe we made a lot of clubs in the area jealous that day of what a great and we'll supported club Bridgend Sports continues to be. Again couldn't have been more prouder to have been involved in such a great day. Credited has to go to our captain Greg and everyone of the squad who trained and played with real enthusiasm and energy all season.\\" The Junior Section of the Club also played their part with the U12's winning the District D GMG Cup and the U15s making the Semi Finals of the Ospreys Cup. In the 2018/2019 season the Club were delighted when an under 7‚Äôs player from 12 years ago, Zac Hemsley, who registered on the first day of our Mini‚Äôs season played for our first team.

In 1963, the madrasa became the University of al-Qarawiyyin. She is also known as \\"Umm al-Banayn\\". Al-Fihri died around 880 AD. Her story is told by Ibn Abi Zar' (d. between 1310 and 1320) in The Garden of Pages (Rawd al- Qirtas) as founding the Qarawiyyin Mosque. Since she was first mentioned many centuries after her death, her story has been hard to substantiate, and it has been speculated it might be ahistorical. Early life Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque and University Fatima was born around 800 AD in the town of Kairouan, in present-day Tunisia. She is of Arab Qurayshi descent, hence the name \\"al- Qurashiyya\\", 'the Qurayshi one'. Her family was part of a large migration to Fes from Kairouan. Although her family did not start out wealthy, her father, Mohammed al-Fihri, became a successful merchant. Little is known about her personal life, except for what was recorded by 14th century historian Ibn Abi- Zar‚Äô. This may be partly due to the fact that the Al-Qarawiyyin's archives suffered a large fire in 1323. Al-Fihri was married, but both her husband and father died shortly after the wedding. Her father left his wealth to both Fatima and her sister, his only children. She and her sister Maryam were well- educated and studied the Islamic jurisprudence Fiqh and the Hadith, or the records of Prophet Muhammed. Both went on to found mosques in Fes: Fatima founded Al-Qarawiyyin and Maryam founded Al-Andalus. The historicity of this story has been questioned by some modern historians who see the symmetry of two sisters founding the two most famous mosques of Fes as too convenient and likely originating from legend. Ibn Abi Zar is also judged by contemporary historians to be a relatively unreliable source. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges to this story is a foundation inscription that was rediscovered during renovations to the mosque in the 20th century, previously hidden under layers of plaster for centuries. This inscription, carved onto cedar wood panels and written in a Kufic script very similar to foundation inscriptions in 9th-century Tunisia, was found on a wall above the probable site of the mosque's original mihrab (prior to the building's later expansions). The inscription, recorded and deciphered by Gaston Deverdun, proclaims the foundation of \\"this mosque\\" () by Dawud ibn Idris (a son of Idris II who governed this region of Morocco at the time) in Dhu al-Qadah 263 AH (July- August of 877 CE). Deverdun suggested the inscription may have come from another unidentified mosque and was moved here at a later period (probably 15th or 16th century) when the veneration of the Idrisids was resurgent in Fes and such relics would have held enough religious significance to be reused in this way. However, Chafik Benchekroun argued more recently that a more likely explanation is that this inscription is the original foundation inscription of the Qarawiyyin Mosque itself and that it might have been covered up in the 12th century just before the arrival of the Almohads in the city. Based on this evidence and on the many doubts about Ibn Abi Zar's narrative, he argues that Fatima al-Fihri is quite possibly a legendary figure rather than a historical one. Founding of Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque Fatima used the money she inherited from her father to purchase a mosque that was built around 845 AD under the supervision of King Yahya ibn Muhammad. She then rebuilt it and bought the surrounding land, doubling its size. The construction project was supervised by Fatima herself. Although the mosque's architecture is extravagant, Fatima made a point to build it modestly. As Tunisian historian Hassan Hosni Abdelwahab noted in his book Famous Tunisian Women: > \\"She committed to only using the land she had purchased. She dug deep into > the land, unearthing yellow sand, plaster, and stone to use, so as not to > draw suspicion from others [for using too many resources].\\" The mosque took 18 years to construct. According to Moroccan historian Abdelhadi Tazi, Al-Fihri fasted until the project's completion. When it was finished, she went inside and prayed to God, thanking him for his blessings. She named it after the immigrants from her hometown of Kairouan. According to tradition, Fatima's sister Mariam also founded a similar mosque in the district across the river the same year (859), with help from local Andalusian families, which became known as the Al-Andalusiyyin Mosque (Mosque of the Andalusians).  The Al-Qarawiyyin Madrasa/University The earliest sources mention founding of the Mosque of Al-Qarawiyyin, but do not mention its role as a madrasa or a teaching institution. The earliest mentions to halaqat (circles) for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th Century. The historian Abdelhadi Tazi indicated the earliest evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121. Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that it was during the reign of the Almoravids (1040‚Äì1147) that the teaching function was added to the mosque. Other historians such as √âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal date the beginning of teaching to the Marinid period. Students were male, but traditionally it has been said that \\"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (riwaq) overlooking the scholars' circle.\\" Some sources referred the Qarawiyyin as the oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world. The height of its prestige and intellectual productivity is argued to have been around the 13th to 15th centuries when it benefited from increased patronage by the Marinid dynasty and its curriculum was it its broadest, ranging from Islamic jurisprudence to sciences like astronomy, medicine, and mathematics. Following this apogee, it underwent a period of decline and progressive reforms over several centuries. It became a state university in 1963.Lulat, Y. G.-M.: A History Of African Higher Education From Antiquity To The Present: A Critical Synthesis, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, , pp. 154‚Äì157 Today the university specializes in traditional subjects such as Islamic law, theology, and Arabic grammar, while also offering courses in other subjects like the humanities. The library in Al-Qarawiyyin is sometimes cited as one of the oldest in the world. Recently it was renovated by Canadian-Moroccan architect Aziza Chaouni and reopened to the public in May 2016. The library's collection of over 4000 manuscripts includes a 9th-century Qur'an and the earliest collection of hadiths.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of an island platform and serves the L1 line of the Oslo Commuter Rail operated by the Norwegian State Railways. It had 900 daily passengers in 2008. The first station at Slependen was located further west and opened on 11 September 1873, a year after the Drammen Line. It was variously known as Sl√¶benden and Sl√¶bende until it took its present name in 1921. A new station building was erected in 1916 and demolished in 1960. With the doubling of the Drammen Line, Slependen was rebuilt to the east, still on a curve, as an elevated station. This station was designed by Ina Backer. That station and the one to the east, Jong Station, were closed on 23 May 1993 and replaced by the current station, designed by Arne Henriksen. History The Drammen Line through Slependen opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The area was at first served by Sandvika Station, but the station, initially known as Sl√¶benden, was opened on 11 September 1873. A year later the name was changed to Sl√¶bende, from April 1894 as Sl√¶benden and received its current name in April 1921. The original station was situated from Oslo West Station. The second station, at the same location, opened in 1916. It was demolished in 1960. The third station at Slependen was constructed as part of the double-tracking of the Drammen Line between Sandvika and Asker. As the first of four phases, the double track past Slependen opened on 9 November 1958. Along with Billingstad Station and Hvalstad Station, Slependen was built as an elevated station. Designed by Ina Becker of NSB Arkitektkontor, it receive an island platform and was built over a road, from where the access to the station came. The station building filled the entire width of the platform and was therefore located at the end. Like the original location, Slependen was located in a curve, resulting in a cuneate shape. The polished concrete building featured a flat roof and slate cornice. The new station was situated further Sandvika than the first two stations. Jong Station, situated between Slependen and Sandvika, opened in 1959. From that year Slependen Post Office moved into the station, where it remained until 1993. Interior of the rotunda By the late 1980s both Slependen and Jong Stations were in poor shape and in need for modernization. In particular, the platforms were less than long. NSB had just ordered new center cars for their Class 69 commuter trains and a double set would therefore exceed the platform length. Both stations were located in curves. NSB therefore proposed merging the two station, located apart, and instead building a new station between them. This was estimated to cost 8.4 million Norwegian krone in 1986. This involved moving the station towards Sandvika. The new station, designed by Arne Henriksen, opened on 23 May 1993, the same day the old station and Jong were closed. The old station was demolished in 1996. Facilities NSB Class 69 train at the station Slependen Station is situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station. The line past the station featured double track and is equipped with a long and tall island platform with two tracks. It is situated in a mostly residential area next to a steep slope. Access to the platform from the steep side is via a rotunda, which features a circular ramp and stairs. This is connected to the staircase on the platform via an overpass, as is access from the other side of the tracks. These are built in untreated concrete, although ceilings and walls are clad in pine. The station has parking for 80 cars. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Slependen with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Spikkestad Station along the Spikkestad Line to Asker Station and past Slependen to Oslo Central Station. It then continues along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m Station. Slependen has two trains per direction per hour, which is scheduled to increase to four in late 2014. The station had about 900 daily passengers in 2008. Travel time to Oslo Central Station is 21 minutes.

The name 'bedeutung' comes from the German word which means 'meaning'. Publication Bedeutung was started in May 2007. The magazine is published four times a year. It features a number of essays by prominent philosophers, sociologists, authors, public intellectuals, thinkers, artists and curators on a range of topics that are overarched by a general theme that runs through the whole issue. Issue 1 was on the distinction between Nature & Culture. It has been suggested that the magazine should be read in the sequence that it is printed, as its structure gradually moves from abstract philosophical ('Philosophy' section) to more concrete and \\"journalistic\\" type of articles ('Current Affairs' section) leading, eventually, to the 'Art' section and closing with the 'Literature' section. The magazine has (already prior to the publication of the first issue) received a lot of attention from various academic and artistic sections, thanks to its combination of analytical thinking, provocative and controversial positions and its beautiful, elegant design. For example, on the first issue, and as it was announced on the magazine's website already months before the issue was out, the Editorship embraced a skeptical approach to environmentalism, illustrated by, amongst others, the interview with Martin Durkin, producer of The Great Global Warming Swindle. Despite that, however, the approach seems to have been sober enough, not to alienate readers but, instead, to engage them in an open debate. The issue of the magazine themed \\"Human & Divine\\" featured articles by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, LSE political philosopher, John Gray, renowned atheist philosopher, A. C. Grayling, LSE social scientist Nicos Mouzelis, an interview with anti- religion crusader Michel Onfray and features the Austrian actionist artist Hermann Nitsch, British artist Becky Beasley, Miuccia Prada prot√©g√© Martino Gamper and Warren Neidich. It also includes a piece by author Sarah Wood. The back cover features an extract by Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. According to the editorial, the second issue of the magazine sets out to defend the view that our idea of secularism bears significant conceptual resemblances with religious belief, in that it is based in faith, rather than objective knowledge. The third issue of Bedeutung, themed \\"Life & Death\\", was announced on the magazine's website.

Its location just north of the Bosphorus Bridge, with the view of the Bosphorus, makes it an attractive facility that houses bars, 6 restaurants and two swimming pools. Only far from the European coast, the islet is reachable by free ferry service. In Autumn 2002, construction has started to turn the Galatasaray Islet into one of the most prominent landmarks of the city. Totally rebuilt, it serves since July 2007 the Galatasaray community and Istanbulers as an entertainment and recreation center. A fire broke out in the kitchen chimney on October 4, 2007 that burnt down two restaurants and damaged four other premises on the islet. In 2017, Nilhan Osmanoglu (Sultan Abdulhamid's granddaughter) stated they will claim ownership of the islet in future.CNNTurk 2.2.2017 Nilhan Osmanoglu, the granddaughter of Abd√ºlhamit II, wants Suada  History  Galatasaray Islet May 2009 Galatasaray Islet May 2009 In 1872, Ottoman sultan Abd√ºlaziz (reigned 1861‚Äì1876) granted the islet to the Ottoman-Armenian court architect Sarkis Balyan (1835‚Äì1899), who erected a three-story house on it as his own residence. In 1874, during one of his several visits to Istanbul, Russian-Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky stayed in the mansion of Sarkis on the islet, and made here a number of paintings commissioned by the sultan for the Dolmabah√ße Palace. Called as the \\"Sarkis Bey Islet\\" during his lifetime, it was rented out by his legal heirs after the World War I to \\"≈ûirket-i Hayriye\\", the company operating passenger ferries in Istanbul, and was used for a long time as a coal depot. In 1957, Galatasaray S.K. purchased the islet and constructed premises and sports facilities on it. The swimming pool on the islet served home to the water polo team from 1957 to 1968.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of an island platform and serves the L1 line of the Oslo Commuter Rail operated by the Norwegian State Railways. The station served 255,000 passengers in 2012. It opened on 3 March 1919; it received a rebuilt in 1958, becoming an elevated station on a section of double track. History The Drammen Line past Billingstad opened on 7 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom: 189 Inga Falsen Gjerdrum was the main enthusiast to establish a station at Billingstad, and a street near the station is named in her honor. Billingstad opened as a staffed station on 3 March 1919.Bjerke & Holom: 192 A year later it received a used station building from Sk√∏yen Station. The line was electrified on 30 August 1922 and an interlocking system was installed on 18 October 1924. The section of the Drammen Line between Sandvika Station and Asker Station was doubled between 1953 and 1958. As part of this work two sections of track were rerouted, including the segment just east of Billingstad Station. There the Billingstad Tunnel was built. The double track from Billingstad to Hvalstad Station was the first to open, on 24 July 1953. The tunnel opened with one track on 6 September 1954 and the second on 29 November 1955. However, the segment of double track from Billingstad to Sandvika was not taken into regular use until 9 November 1958.Bjerke & Holom: 195 NSB Arkitektkontor carried out the design of the new station and Torolf Larsen was the architect for Billingstad. Similar to Hvalstad and Slependen, Billingstad was rebuilt as an elevated station with an underpass for traffic and access from below.Hartmann: 95 The new station was taken into use in 1958. The line past the station received automatic train stop and centralized traffic control on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received axle counters instead of track circuits in 2012. Facilities Billingstad Station is situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station at an elevation of above mean sea level. The line past the station features double track. The station consists of a long and tall island platform with two tracks and a shed. The station is elevated and situated over an underpass for road traffic, with access from below. The station building is built in polished concrete and covers the entire width of the platform ‚Äì and is therefore located at the end. The location on a curve has given it the building a cuneate shape and a lean-on roof. Billingstad is a mixed residential and commercial area. There are both areas of single dwellings and condominiums within the station's catchment area. In addition the area features a large commercial and industrial site, including an IKEA outlet and its Norwegian headquarters. As of 2008, there were 4,300 people living within of the station and 3,600 jobs within the same area. The station has parking for 48 cars and a bicycle stand. There is a ticket vending machine and a taxi stand at the station. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Billingstad with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Spikkestad Station along the Spikkestad Line to Asker Station and past Slependen to Oslo Central Station. It then continues along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m Station. Billingstad has two trains per direction per hour, which is scheduled to increase to four in late 2014. The station had about 900 daily passengers in 2008, and 250,000 annual passengers in 2012. Travel time to Oslo Central Station is 23 minutes.

The play has attracted the attention of modern critics for its juxtaposition of the themes of primogeniture and piracy.Barbard Fuchs, \\"Faithless Empires: Pirates, Renegadoes and the English Nation,\\" English Literary History Vol. 67, No. 1 (Spring 2000), pp. 45-69.Mark Netzloff, England's Internal Colonies: Class, Capital, and the Literature of Early Modern English Colonialism, London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. Publication Fortune by Land and Sea was entered into the Stationers' Register on 20 June 1655, and was published later that year in a quarto by the booksellers John Sweeting and Robert Pollard. This poorly-printed quarto was the only edition of the play to appear during the 17th century.Herman Doh, \\"Compositorial Responsibility in Fortune by Land and Sea, 1655,\\" The Library, 5th series, Vol. 29 (1974). Date and performance Scholars date the play to the 1607-09 period.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 343. The title page of the 1655 quarto states that the drama was acted \\"by the Queen's servants\\", that is by Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre. Heywood was a key member of that company as both actor and playwright, and Rowley was writing for them too at that time. Genre The 1655 quarto calls the play a tragicomedy, though it differs from the specific genre as it was developed by John Fletcher and his imitators during the Jacobean and Caroline eras. Instead the play belongs to the older tradition of romantic adventure that both Heywood and Rowley exploited in their playwriting careers, in works like Heywood's The Four Prentices of London (c. 1592), and The Travels of the Three English Brothers (1607), which Rowley wrote with George Wilkins and John Day. Subject matter The play contrasts the fortunes of its characters in two radically different domains of experience: those living traditional English lives on land are ruled by the strictures of the primogeniture system, while escape to sea means a life of anarchic freedom, danger, and opportunity. Heywood exploited the subject of piracy in other works, notably his two-part play The Fair Maid of the West. In Fortune by Land and Sea, the playwrights based their plot on actual events from the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as recounted in a 1583 pamphlet. The dramatists were looking back to an Elizabethan age of optimism and expansionism, from a Jacobean period that conspicuously lacked those traits.Claire Jowitt, \\"Piracy and Politics in Heywood and Rowley's Fortune by Land and Sea (1607-9),\\" Renaissance Studies Vol. 16, No. 2 (June 2002), pp. 217-33. Synopsis The play relates the story of two interlocked rural families -- two patriarchs, known simply as Old Forrest and Old Harding, each of whom has three children. Forrest has two sons and a daughter, and Harding has three sons. Through the course of the play, it is revealed that the families have endured contrasting reversals of fortune: when the two patriarchs were young men, the Forrest family was prosperous and land-rich, while the Hardings were their tenant farmers. Over the course of the two men's lives, the Forrests were reduced to comparative poverty while the Hardings flourished. Their contrasting fortunes may be the result of the two men's characters: Old Forrest is a mild-mannered and moral gentleman, while Old Harding is grasping and ruthless. In the opening scene, Old Forrest tries dissuade his headstrong elder son Frank from carousing with his fair- weather friends, a \\"quarrelsome gentleman\\" named Rainsford and his hangers-on Foster and Goodwin. Frank Forrest ignores his father's sententious advice; but during the evening Rainsford insults Old Forrest to his son's face, calling him a \\"fool\\" and \\"dotard.\\" The two draw their swords and fight, and Frank Forrest is killed. His family recover his body, but cannot prove the crime against Rainsford, who has powerful connections with the nobility. Meanwhile, Old Harding has just married a new young wife. Harding's younger sons William and John, unhappy at this development, are hostile to their new stepmother, until Old Harding makes his displeasure plain; then the two young men grow more respectful. When Old Harding learns that his eldest son Philip has married Susan Forrest, a young woman of virtue but no dowry, he rejects the match and refuses the young couple all support. To survive, Philip and Susan must become servants in Old Harding's household. The new Mrs. Harding treats the couple with compassion, though brothers William and John are harsher toward their fallen older brother and his wife. Another Harding family servant is the play's Clown, who provides the comic relief. Old Forrest's second son, known simply as Young Forrest, seeks out Rainsford and challenges him to a duel. The two fight, and Rainsford is killed. Young Forrest is pursued by the authorities and by Rainsford's friends Goodwin and Foster; fleeing, he leaps the Hardings' garden wall and confronts Mrs. Harding. Hearing his story, she feels compassion for him; she conceals him for a week, then sends him to her brother, a London merchant. He is similarly taken by Young Forrest's good nature, and helps the young man to travel abroad on one of his ships. The Merchant leaves for a voyage of his own shortly after. At sea, the Merchant's ship is waylaid and overcome by two notorious English pirates, Clinton Atkinson and his associate Purser. Young Forrest has the opposite success: he is elected to lead the crew of his vessel when their captain dies, and conducts a successful campaign against Spanish shipping, taking several prizes. Eventually Young Forrest and his crew engage Purser and Clinton in a sea fight, and emerge triumphant; Young Forrest releases the Merchant from captivity and restores his goods and profits. At home, Philip and Susan must endure the oppression of service in the Harding house. The Clown almost tricks Foster and Goodwin into loaning Philip Harding the money he needs to set up his own farm; but Philip's naive honesty makes the trick fall through. Old Harding is prepared to sign the papers that will disinherit son Philip permanently and settle his estate upon younger brothers John and William; but a sailor arrives with the news of the Merchant's original capture by the pirates. Old Harding is heavily invested in the Merchant's venture, and the bad news strikes him so hard that he collapses. The Clown brings word of the old man's sudden death with comic distress: ::O, my master, my master! what shall I do for my poor master? the kind churl is departed! never did poor hard-hearted wretch pass out of the world so like a lamb! alas! for my poor, usuring, extortioning master! many an old widow hast thou turned into the street, and many an orphan made beg for bread! Oh, my sweet, cruel, kind, pitiless, loving, hard-hearted master! he's dead; he's dead; he's gone; he's fled; and now full low must hang his head! Oh, my sweet vile, kind, flinty, mild, uncharitable master! Old Harding has died before the inheritance documents are signed. From the lowly position of a servant, Philip Harding now inherits his father's estate, leaving his younger brothers dependent upon his goodwill. Better news, of Young Forrest's triumph and the Merchant's rescue, quickly arrives; far from taking a large loss, the Harding estate is now wealthier than ever. Philip and Susan are grateful to Mrs. Harding for the favor she showed them in their servitude. By law, Mrs. Harding receives a third of Old Harding's estate, and her investment in her brother's voyage has made her even richer. Young Forrest earns a pardon for Rainsford's death through his defeat of the pirates. Purser and Clinton are shown on their way to execution; they reminisce romantically about the drama and success of their careers in piracy, before they are led off to the gallows. Young Forrest and the Merchant return home to a welcome from their Forrest and Harding relations; the impetuous Young Forrest asks Mrs. Harding to marry him almost as soon as he meets her. The play ends with a general reconciliation; the two younger Harding brothers, and Goodwin and Foster too, have all been reduced to beggary by loose living and ill luck -- but the generous and forgiving Philip Harding offers to relieve their wants.

Interests =Horizontal collaboration= One of his main principle is that the idea, the project is the center of the action. Therefore there is not one author, nor authority and novelty is not a major preoccupation even if every project, in its practical existence requires a lot of creativity and invention: not creating technologies but inventing creative usages of recent technologies, often through hacking and hybridization. The product of the collaborative process in the architecture realm is therefore more oriented toward the culture quality, embodying technology as culture. When authorship is involved with identified individuals, Bengt Sj√∂l√©n, Usman Haque, Tamas Szakal, Massimo Banzi, Peter Halacsy, Peter Hudini, Andras Kangyal, Attila Nemes, Anita Pozna can be picked as recurrent collaborators. Peer production (coined within social sciences) in a \\"controlled environment like Kitchen Budapest created the necessity of a work methodology : throwing ideas, and a collectively agreed distributing of time, \\"60% own personal project, 35% someone else's project, 5% practical collective tasks)\\". The work of Adam Somlai-Fischer in the Kitchen Budapest is more than to identify areas of interest and organise the dynamics as groups of work : \\"Mobile expression\\", \\"Networked things\\", \\"DIY media, intergang\\", \\"Toy hack space\\", \\"wireless city\\"... In every project he admits everyone has his/her own goals and satisfaction factors. For him the individual identity can be blurred in the community, but it is precisely the belonging to a community, even as a part of a loose network, that individual identity can emerge stronger. =Sharing= Wifi Camera reveals the electromagnetic space of devices and the shadows created within such spaces.

Emma's father, Will, drinks a lot and lives hand to mouth as a waterman. Her mother, Julia, has become a miserable soul, trying to keep a household together on meager funds.

When no one seems to be very interested in talking to Emma, she finds friendship with a troubled young woman, Merrill, who has returned to town looking to deal with her past. The sweetly innocent Emma allows the world-weary Merrill in some ways to reconnect with her own lost innocence, while Merrill, for her part, provides an oasis for Emma, who feels invisible at home in the eyes of her struggling parents.

Will and Julia love their daughter immensely, but suffer from the financial woes of a poor fishing season, the sudden loss of Will's boat and Will's fierce pride in not having to ask for handouts. Casting *Tara Devon Gallagher plays the pivotal role of 11-year-old Emma Tyler, whose passion for swimming is suddenly disrupted by an ear injury requiring expensive surgery. Although Gallagher never had an acting class before ‚Äì much less ever acted, she beat out hundreds of other preteens from New York, Los Angeles and Maryland. Producers said that they were blown away in her initial audition when they asked her to improvise a line of dialog in the script. Sadler says, \\"it was clear she was seeing and experiencing those things in her mind's eye.\\" *Robert Knott as Will Tyler, a Chesapeake Bay waterman who struggles to hold onto his livelihood. Sadler discovered Knott through actor Ed Harris, who had served as one of Sadler‚Äôs advisors at the Sundance Institute Directing Workshop and had previously cast Knott as his brother in his critically acclaimed film, Pollock. Harris was so impressed with the Swimmers script that he had shown it to Knott before there was any discussion about who would play Will Tyler in the film. *Cherry Jones as Julia Tyler, the fiercely determined wife of Will Tyler. Jones says of her character, \\"She's the matriarch of a family who's bottoming out, and she has got to be the glue that binds everything together.\\" *Shawn Hatosy as Clyde Tyler, the second son who becomes the town‚Äôs patrolman rather than a waterman like his dad. From the moment Hatosy received the script for Swimmers he said the story really affected him, saying \\"The story and the way Doug wrote it ‚Äì from the perspective of the little girl ‚Äì just found its way into me.\\" Being from Maryland originally, Hatosy also had a real soft spot for anything that has to do with his home state. Aware that the production would be auditioning actors the following week, he called producer Melanie Backer and persuaded her to accompany him to a screening of his latest film, Dallas 362. Backer, who was already a Hatosy fan from his work in Outside Providence immediately arranged a meeting with writer-director Doug Sadler. Several hours later, Hatosy had the role. *Sarah Paulson as Merrill, the mysterious, kohl-eyed beauty who suddenly turns up in town in a desperate attempt to understand her own emotionally troubled past. Swimmers casting director Ellen Parks first spotted Paulson in the 1998 off-Broadway hit, Killer Joe, with Scott Glenn and Amanda Plummer. Reception Swimmers was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival's American Spectrum showcase and finalist for the Humanitas Prize. The festival called the movie \\"a uniquely American story that combines an Arthur Miller sense of drama with emotive Edward Hopperesque photography. Swimmers draws us in as naturally as the tide with the sharp reflections of its truth and humanity.\\" Daniel Wible of Film Threat described the film as \\"idyllically filmed\\" and having \\"a wonderfully evocative sense of place.\\" Commenting on the film's water motif, Wible said, \\"Sadler and cinematographer Rodney Taylor draw exquisite visual parallels between the gentle rise and fall of the tide and the banal rhythms of daily seaside life. Their use of water as a timeless surrogate for life, hope, and even death, is particularly interesting, if not entirely original.\\" About the performances, Wible said, \\"the film's cast is uniformly authentic and mesmerizing\\" but that, \\"Swimmers is ultimately young Tara Devon Gallagher's film. The rookie actress improbably delivers a profoundly mature performance that belies her experience.\\"Film Threat review Desson Thomson of The Washington Post wrote that overall, \\"Swimmers is an unhurried delight with persuasive performances, particularly from the beguiling Gallagher. And it evokes a memorable world -- dark mornings on the Chesapeake as watermen take out their chugging boats; silhouettes on piers; and the glistening of wriggling crabs in the sun.\\"Washington Post review The film currently has an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of an island platform and serves the L1 line of the Oslo Commuter Rail operated by the Norwegian State Railways. The station served 233,000 passengers in 2012. The line opened at the same time as the Drammen Line on 7 October 1872. The first station building was a wooden structure designed by Georg Andreas Bull. The station was moved in 1915 to its current location. This resulted in another wooden station building, designed by Jens Flor. The third station building, designed by Julie Kristiansen, was completed in 1957. This resulted in the station being raised to an elevated structure. Bull's building has been demolished, while Flor's and Kristiansen's have been listed as heritage sites. History Bull's original station building in 1904 Hvalstad was along with Asker Station the only stations to be opened along with the Drammen Line on 8 October 1872.Bjerke & Holom: 189 The first station building was a simple wooden structure designed by Georg Andreas Bull. It was a stable design, which was seen on several low-traffic stations along the Randsfjorden Line, the Drammen Line and the J√¶ren Line.Hartmann: 138 Near the station there was a wooden viaduct, the Hvalstad Viaduct. It was the largest of its kind in Northern Europe and became a tourist attraction. The station became the natural center for the area and soon both residences and shops. In the mid-1910s, the Norwegian State Railways decided to replace Hvalstad Viaduct. This required the rebuilding of of the Drammen Line past Hvalstad. It also required the moving of the station, about parallel to the tracks to the southwest. This also involved the construction of a tunnel on each side of the new station, the Hvalstad 2 Tunnel to the north and the Hvalstad 3 Tunnel.Bjerke & Holom: 195 The new station received a new station building, designed by Jens Flor of NSB Arkitektkontor. The new segment of track opened on 14 June 1915 and the old viaduct was demolished in 1916. Bull's original station building The line past Hvalstad was electrified on 30 August 1922, and the station received an interlocking system on 20 September 1929.Bjerke & Holom: 194 The line between Sandvika Station and Asker Station was doubled between 1953 and 1958. This resulted in a new tunnel being built south of Hvalstad Station for both tracks, replacing the old tunnel. The segment of double track between Billingstad and Hvalstad opened on 24 July 1953 and the segment from Hvalstad to Asker Tunnel opened on 29 November 1955. NSB Arkitektkontor carried out the design of the new station and Julie Kristiansen was the architect for Hvalstad. Similar to Billingstad and Slependen, Hvalstad was rebuilt as an elevated station with an underpass for traffic and access from below.Hartmann: 95 The new station was taken into use in 1957. It was used both for ticket sales and had a Narvesen kiosk. Bull's original station was demolished in 1960. From the 1960s there was a substantial construction of residences in the station's catchment area. The line past the station received automatic train stop and centralized traffic control on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received a renovation in 2011, including receiving axle counters instead of track circuits in 2012. Akershus County Municipality has looked into the possibility for building additional parking places at the station to allow it to become a park and ride complex. A survey from 2010 showed that 25 of 40 people parking at the station lived within of the station. Facilities Hvalstad Station is situated on the Drammen Line, from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. Located on a segment of double track, the station features a long and tall island platform with two tracks and a shed. Flor's station building from 1915 has been listed as a heritage site The station is elevated with an underpass over the road and access from below. Kristiansen's station building is made of polished concrete and square in shape. Because it covers the entire width of the platform, it was located at the end. It was built to solely serve local traffic and lacks any cargo or other advanced features. Next to the station is Flor's wooden station building. It features detailed wooden decors over the oval gable windows and doors. It is now used as a residence and veterinary clinic. Both have been listed as heritage sites. Flor's because of its intricate and aesthetic design, while Kristiansen has been listed as a representative of the simple, concrete elevated stations built during the 1950s. In addition, they vicinity and contrast were decisive in determining their protection status.Hartmann: 127 The station has parking for 33 cars and a bicycle stand. Hvalstad is primarily a residential area. Within there are, as of 2008, 2,200 residents and 600 jobs. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Hvalstad with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Spikkestad Station along the Spikkestad Line to Asker Station and past Slependen to Oslo Central Station. It then continues along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m Station. Hvalstad has two trains per direction per hour, which is scheduled to increase to four in late 2014. The station had about 900 daily passengers in 2008, and 230,000 annually in 2012. Travel time to Oslo Central Station is 26 minutes.

Iseman (born 1967) is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist working for the firm Iseman & Szelinga. As a lobbyist for the firm Alcalde & Fay she gained national media attention in February 2008, due to her involvement in the John McCain lobbyist controversy. Personal A native of Indiana, Pennsylvania, Vicki Iseman graduated in 1985 from the Homer-Center High School, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the student council. She went on to attend the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a bachelor's degree in Elementary Education in 1990. In 2006, she delivered the commencement address at her old high school, and would lobby for both that school and her alma mater during her career. Her family still lives in Indiana County, where she is recalled as a \\"hometown girl who made good\\". Career Within months of graduation, Iseman joined a friend in Washington, D.C. and initially got a job as a receptionist at Alcalde & Fay. After a few months, she approached the president of Alcalde & Fay and said \\"I‚Äôm a college graduate and I‚Äôd like you to consider me for a secretarial or an administrative position.\\" The president agreed to a three-month trial and within a year she became his special assistant. From this position, Iseman learned about lobbying from the firm's president, and soon became a lobbyist in her own right. Eight years later, she became the youngest partner in the history of Alcalde & Fay. =Clients= Her clients have most notably been broadcasters who were interested in the regulation of cable television. Her most prominent broadcast clients from 1998 through 2006 have included PAX Network (and its corporate parent, Paxson Communications), CanWest Global Communications, Religious Voices in Broadcasting, ION Media Networks, Click Radio, i2 Telecom International, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Total Living Network, Jovan Broadcasting, Saga Communications, Capstar Broadcasting Partners, Telemundo, and the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (purchased in 2003 by Univision Communications, Inc. and renamed Univision Radio). She is also known for her work for the telecommunications industry, including her lobbying for BearingPoint and the Computer Sciences Corporation. Some of her other prominent clients have been PricewaterhouseCoopers, Carnival Cruise Lines (and the family trust of owner Micky Arison), AstraZeneca, CACI, FCCLA, American Medical Facilities Management, Marin County and Tulare County, California, Hillsborough County, Florida, and the cities of Miami, Florida, and Palm Springs, California. She also lobbied for some charitable personal causes, including her aforementioned efforts for her former high school and university. =Lobbying activities= On behalf of these clients, she lobbied both the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. In the course of hearings on communications bills in 1992 and 1996 which eventually led to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, she argued that cable TV should have to carry broadcast television. She also represented her clients' interests with respect to the upcoming conversion to digital television; satellite reception; and telecommunications ownership provisions. Her other activities as a lobbyist included public organizing on behalf of clients interested in the allocation of Federal Highway Administration trust funds, assisting clients interested in securing government contracts and government appropriations, and participating in political fundraising. In February 2015, Politico reported that based on a press release, Iseman and fellow Acalde & Fay attorney Tatanya Szeliga formed Iseman & Szelinga, a new \\"spinoff\\" of Acalde & Fay focusing on government affairs and public relations, intending to maintain a \\"strategic alliance\\" with the previous firm. Lawsuit against The New York Times In December 2008, Iseman filed a US$27 million defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging that the paper, in the course of describing circumstances of her lobbying activity, had falsely implied an illicit romantic relationship between her and Senator John McCain. The Times said they \\"fully stood behind the article\\" and the story was \\"true and accurate\\". The suit was subsequently settled without payment in February 2009. As part of the settlement, Ms. Iseman accepted the Times‚Äô explanation,\\"Joint Statement\\", New York Times (2009-02-19). which appeared in a \\"Note to Readers\\" published in the newspaper. The \\"Note to Readers\\" said: \\"The article did not state, and The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients in breach of the public trust.\\"\\"Note to Readers\\", New York Times (2009-02-19).

History The Nuffield Trust was established in December 1939 as the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust by Viscount Nuffield (William Morris), the founder of Morris Motors. It was set up to coordinate the activities of all hospitals operating outside London and helped inspire the creation of the National Health Service. Indeed, one of its first tasks was a complete survey of hospitals, which was used as a key reference document in the establishment of the NHS.McLachlan, p. 34. In 1998 the Trust adopted the name The Nuffield Trust for Research and Policy Studies in Health Services, retaining \\"The Nuffield Trust\\" as its working name. Areas of work Since its foundation the Nuffield Trust has commissioned a wide range of research on how to improve the health system in the UK, for instance by a Rock Carling Fellowship. In 1971, the epidemiologist Archie Cochrane received a Rock Carling Fellowship to write Effectiveness and efficiency: Random reflections on health services. He argued for greater use of randomised control trials in assessing medical evidence and led to the creation of Cochrane. In 1976, the British public health scientist and health care critic, Thomas McKeown, MD, received the Rock Carling Fellowship, which allowed him to write The role of medicine: Dream, mirage or nemesis?. Therein he summarized facts and arguments that supported what became known as the McKeown's thesis, i.e. that the growth of population can be attributed to a decline in mortality from infectious diseases, primarily thanks to better nutrition, later also to better hygiene, and only marginally and late to medical interventions such as antibiotics and vaccins. McKeown was heavily criticized for his controversial ideas, but is nowadays remembered as 'the founder of social medicine'.

The game was released worldwide in January 2009 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 after the spin-off title Skate It. It is the sequel to 2007's Skate and the third installment in the Skate series overall. Set in the fictional city of San Vanelona, the single-player career mode follows a skateboarder released from jail five years after being arrested in the first game, Skate, who is tasked with popularising skateboarding in the city again after devastating earthquakes, avoiding security guards hired by the company \\"Mongocorp\\" who have bought most of the city's property. Players create their own character and perform tricks such as ollies and grabs to earn points. Tricks can be used to complete challenges, such as racing and trick contests, which earn the player money that can be used to buy clothes and property or bet on events. Up to four players can play against each other in the local multiplayer \\"party play\\" mode, and an online multiplayer mode allows players to connect to games over the internet and take part in various competitive or cooperative activities. Plans for a new Skate game were announced on February 12, 2008, with EA Games' president Frank Gibeau stating that sales of the first game had \\"greatly exceeded\\" his expectations. Skate 2 was announced in May 2008. The executive producer of the game, Scott Blackwood, stated that EA Black Box had given the player the ability to do \\"a lot more\\" while staying true to the \\"authentic feel\\" of the Flickit control scheme. Developers noted New San Vanelona's architectural similarities with Barcelona, San Francisco and Vancouver. A demo for the game was released for Xbox 360 on January 8, 2009 and for PlayStation 3 on January 15, 2009. The third main game in the series, titled Skate 3, was released in May 2010.  Gameplay  Skate 2 is a skateboarding extreme sports game set in an open world environment and played from a third person perspective. The game is set in the fictional city of San Vanelona, the player controls a skateboarder who has just been released from prison after being arrested 5 years ago in the first title in the series, Skate. Since spending time in jail, San Vanelona has been hit with an earthquake that occurred in the spin-off title Skate It, leaving the city in ruins. The City Council and Chamber of Commerce have deemed skateboarding a crime and a corporation called \\"Mongocorp\\" have bought and rebuilt most of the city's property, skate-proofed everything and installed a private security force to prevent people from skating. Upon exiting prison, the player meets Giovanni Reda, a cameraman who films the player's character throughout the game and provides commentary. The player is tasked with rebuilding their skater's career and popularising skateboarding in San Vanelona again. A screenshot from a challenge in Skate 2 showing the player character performing a nose manual trick. The player can gain points by performing tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grinds and grabs. A feature returning from Skate is the \\"Flickit\\" control scheme, which requires the user to move the controller's right stick in certain patterns to perform tricks using the skateboarder's feet. Points gained from a trick are based on multiple factors, such as its height, length and complexity. The player can perform multiple tricks at a time, which are then combined into a \\"sequence,\\" scoring more points than individual tricks. Performing multiple sequences starts a timer, and performing sequences within the timer creates a \\"line,\\" which scores more points than performing individual sequences. Once the line timer runs out, the points gained from the line are added to the player's score. Skate 2s main single-player mode is the \\"career\\" mode. From the beginning of the career mode, the player can create their own custom character and have the ability to change their gender, hair colour and facial shape, as well as choose their clothes and accessories, customise their skateboard and change their skating style, among other features. The player completes challenges to progress through the career mode, such as racing against other skateboarders, doing photoshoots for magazines or entering trick competitions. Completing challenges rewards the player with money, which can be used to buy clothes and property such as skateparks, as well as bet on events. Completing enough challenge events also gains the player sponsorships from truck, wheel or shoe companies, providing the player with free gear, entry to more competitions and extra money. As Skate 2 is set in an open world, and the game's challenges can be found in its different locations. A map can be accessed in the game's pause menu, displaying challenges and locations in San Vanelona and allowing the player to teleport directly to them. Challenges can also be retried from the map. Outside of challenges, the player can freely roam the game's environment. Certain areas in San Vanelona are controlled by Mongocorp, called \\"Mongocorp zones.\\" Security guards patrol in these areas, and if a Mongocorp security guard sees the player skateboarding in a Mongocorp zone or the player angers a civilian anywhere, they will be chased until they escape the area. The player can be knocked off their board by people they're chased by, and if a Mongocorp security guard catches the player in a Mongocorp zone, any removed caps in the area are replaced. The player's character has the ability to jump off their skateboard and walk around, allowing them to traverse areas that are hard to skate on, such as stairs. While on foot, the player has the ability to grab onto objects such as ramps and quarter pipes and pull them around, allowing the player to skate on them in different areas. While on a skateboard, the player can also grab on to cars and be pulled around by them, called \\"skitching.\\" The player have access to an in-game cell phone, which can be used to access a list of contacts. Here, the player can request services such as pool draining, removal of caps from rails in an area or temporary security in Mongocorp zones. The player can also contact any professional skateboarders met in the career mode and challenge them to a \\"throwdown,\\" a game of S.K.A.T.E. \\"Team Film Challenges\\" can be started from the cell phone, where players perform certain tricks in order to get sponsorships. The cell phone can be used to set \\"session markers,\\" points where the player can teleport to quickly. Movable objects can be selected to be included in a session marker, resetting them to their initial position anytime the player teleports back to their session marker. The player have the ability to manually make their player \\"bail,\\" or fall off their skateboard. While bailing, the player can rotate their character and make them move into four different positions. In the career mode, bailing enters the \\"Thrasher Hall of Meat\\" mode, where the player is tasked with damaging their character as much as possible. Skate 2s second single-player mode, \\"freeskate,\\" allows the player to skate around San Vanelona freely as any character unlocked in the career mode. Freeskate mode also allows the player to control settings such as density of traffic and pedestrians, and whether Mongocorp zones are active. The game also contains a local multiplayer mode, \\"party play,\\" and an online multiplayer mode. In party play, two to four players can go against each other in one of three challenges. The game's online multiplayer mode allows multiple players to freeskate in a certain location together over the internet. Players can propose \\"freeskate activities,\\" competitive or cooperative challenges that can be played with other players, as well as invite friends to join their current game. A \\"ranked\\" mode allows players to play against each other in one of six different modes to win money and experience points, and an \\"unranked\\" mode allows players to play ranked challenges without affecting their experience points or winning money. In any of the game's modes, the player can save videos of their skater and edit the footage in the \\"replay editor,\\" allowing different filters to be applied and speed of footage and the angle of the camera to be changed, among other things. This footage could be uploaded to \\"Skate.Reel,\\" an online service where players could view and rate other user created videos made in Skate 2. The player can also enter the \\"Create-a-Spot Editor,\\" where they can create skating \\"spots\\" using a variety of ramps, rails and other objects. The player can skate on their own spots, and could also upload them to the \\"Create-a-Spot Browser,\\" where they could set the spot's high score and challenge other players to download and beat it. A graphics creator also allowed players to create custom graphics on the Skate website and download them in-game to display on shirts, boards and hats. These online features have since been discontinued. Various downloadable content packs have been released for the game, such as a \\"Filmer Pack\\" that adds more replay editor options to the game.  Development  Plans for a new Skate game were initially announced by EA Games' president Frank Gibeau in a presentation for industry analysts on February 12, 2008, stating that sales of the first game had \\"greatly exceeded\\" his expectations. Skate 2 was officially announced in May 2008. Skate 2 was developed by EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts. Scott Blackwood, the executive producer of the game, stated that EA Black Box stayed true to the \\"authentic feel of the Flickit analog controls\\" but had given the player the ability to do \\"a lot more.\\" The developers noted that areas of New San Vanelona have more distinct architectural connections with Barcelona, Spain, San Francisco, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia than in the previous title of the series. EA Black Box and Electronic Arts promised a \\"seamless transition from offline to online\\" gameplay and a set of new competitive modes for the game. A demo for Skate 2 was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on January 8, 2009 and for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store on January 15, 2009. It features a character creator and demonstrations of the career and party play modes, as well as the game's replay editor.  Reception  Skate 2 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics on both platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic. Official Xbox Magazine said the game had good control but will be too hard for casual gamers. Game Informer said that Skate 2 accomplishes the impossible task of making old gameplay feel fresh. They said that while some new tricks were added, the game built upon the original and improved its formula. GameSpot said that the new content was welcomed but the walking and moving objects were clumsy at best. IGN's US review praised Black Box for building upon their winning formula and keeping the gameplay fun. They explained that while the presentation is good, the story seems weak at times and the graphics are not as sharp as they could be. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40, while Famitsu 360 gave the Xbox 360 version a score of one seven, two eights, and one seven for a total of 30 out of 40.  Sequel  A trailer for its sequel was released in September 2009. Skate 3 was released in May 2010. The third game in the series has a stronger focus on online team-based gameplay and content creation than the previous games.

It consists of over fifty utility programs for database access and support, batch updating, and report generation. It was developed by Bob Tidd at the University of California, Berkeley in 1962, and predated many of the commercial and opensource databases in use today. It is still in use on a wide variety of systems at the University and associated institutions.  Features  An INP database may contain up to 100K records of up to 1024 characters (expandable). Up to ten database indexes are allowed. They are btrees of no more than three levels. Databases must contain fixed length records, but some utilities handle variable length, delimited field records. A newline (RETURN) character at the end of each record makes INP databases accessible to the entire array of Unix utilities, including editors, sort, grep, awk, etc. In the data entry and update program, each data field is displayed separately on the screen with a descriptive label. Fields may be skipped during entry or duplicated from the previous record. INP validates each data field as it is entered. Validation types vary from simple alphabetic/numeric through ranges of numbers to tables of all allowable values. If a field is incorrect INP displays the validation criteria, beeps, and returns you to the start of the offending field. A mechanism exists to override validation checks. An optional audit trail of changes is maintained for reference and recovery. The database access program is already compiled. It reads database description files at run time. The record layout and validation criteria are specified in one schema file. The specifications for the screen displays are entered into format files. Both are created by the user with any text editor. A variety of formats may be created to view or update different parts of a database record. INP is implemented on the DEC VAX and PDP-11 under BSD Unix or ULTRIX. Versions are available for SunOS and Onyx. Several operators can simultaneously access or update information in the same database file. Typists and others with little data processing experience find INP easy to use, and they usually become comfortable with the computer related processes rapidly. Like most editors, INP has many command options, but the basic few are easily learned. INP is very forgiving, helpful and bulletproof about data entry and command errors.  Applicability  INP can be used for any small to medium database or data entry task. Basic applications of INP can be designed and implemented by persons familiar with Unix and the text editor, but without programming experience. INP has two powerful sets of options. The elf package allows user supplied coded functions (in the C programming language) for special validation and arbitrarily complex operations including forked programs to occur when various INP commands are requested by the operator. This opens up \\"sky's the limit\\" possibilities for projects implemented using INP. INP comes with an extensive library of functions, including the keyed database access package, which can be incorporated into custom applications.

Ptolemy makes it a port of the Unelli or Veneli, a Gallic nation who occupied part of Armorica. The Table contains a route from Alauna to Caesarodunum (modern Tours), in which the next station to Alauna is Cronciaconnum, distant 10¬Ω Roman miles (milia passuum, or M. P. (\\"1,000 paces\\")) from Alauna. Its position, therefore, depends on that of Alauna. Crociatonum lies between Alauna and Augustodorus (modern Bayeux), from which it is 31¬Ω M. P. distant. D'Anville, who places Alauna at the Moutiers d'Alonne, fixes Crociatonum at Valognes, in the department of Manche. Accordingly, he considers that there is an error in Ptolemy, for the place is called a port in one manuscript at least. But if Alauna is at or near Valognes, as most modern geographers contend,See, e.g., Crociatonum must be looked for elsewhere. Walckenaer places it at the village of Turqueville, west of Audouville-la-Hubert, at the entrance of the Bay of Isigny. There may have been both a town and a port of the same name. Some geographers, including the editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World would fix Crociatonum at Carentan, west of Isigny-sur-Mer. Crociatonum appears to be a composite of Crocq (spur of land) i (of) aton (place name) um (town). Coutances is usually given as the town of the Unelli, it is also the correct distance ratio's from Moutiers d'Alonne and Bayeux. To The west of Coutances, north of the Sienne estuary is a spur of land (Crocq) ending at Pointe Agon, it would appear that Crociatonum (Crociagonum) ought to be the port on the Sienne estuary serving Coutances.

William Earnshaw (1852 ‚Äì 29 December 1931) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for two Dunedin electorates representing the Liberal Party. He later served on the Legislative Council. He was one of the first labour representatives in Parliament. Early life 'Plain Bill' Earnshaw was born in Manchester, England. He received his education in his home town and showed considerable ability at school. He trained as an all- round mechanic after his schooling. Aged 21, he left for the United States, where he spent two years. He visited Australia and came to New Zealand in 1878. He first settled in Christchurch and worked at the Addington Railway Workshops. He married Gwendoline Marie Payne in Christchurch on 21 July 1880. He moved to Dunedin in 1881, where he was a brass-founder at Anderson and Morrisons. Political career In , Earnshaw contested the electorate against the incumbent, William Larnach. He supported female suffrage and prohibition, and was opposed to selling the railways. Earnshaw's victory made him a national figure, one of the new breed of working-class MPs. Earnshaw represented the Peninsula electorate until the end of the term in 1893, and then the City of Dunedin electorate (‚Äì1896) in the House of Representatives. A strong prohibitionist, Earnshaw became one of Sir Robert Stout's few consistent supporters in Parliament after 1893. This put him off-side with Premier Richard Seddon. Earnshaw came seventh in the three-member Dunedin electorate in the . He came eighth in the three-member electorate in the . Earnshaw was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1913 and served until his death in 1931. Life outside parliament After his 1899 defeat, Earnshaw moved to Gillespies Beach near Fox Glacier, where he was involved in dredging. He later took employment with the Wellington Harbour Board prior to his appointment to the Legislative Council. He died on 29 December 1931 at Wellington Hospital after a short illness. He was survived by his wife and two sons. His wife died in 1947, and both are buried at Karori Cemetery.

He was martyred along with Saint Januarius at Pozzuoli during the Diocletian Persecutions. His feast day is September 23, the date, three days after his death, on which his corpse was translated to Misenum.Franco Zullo, San Sosso, Santi e Beati. Legend The legend conserved in the Atti Bolognesi states that during the Diocletian persecutions, Januarius, bishop of Benevento, escaped from his see and traveled to Pozzuoli \\"incognito.\\" However, his presence became known to Christians in the area, and Januarius maintained contact with Sossius, who was a deacon of Miseno, as well as the deacon Festus and the lector Desiderius. Legend says Januarius, with whom he studied to become a priest, predicted the martyrdom of Sossius when he saw a luminous red light and a dove hover over his head while he read the gospel at mass. Sossius was soon discovered to be a Christian by the local authorities and he was condemned by the judge Dragontius, who condemned him to be killed by wild bears in the local amphitheatre. Januarius, Festus, and Desiderius, on hearing of Sossius‚Äô arrest, took a risk and visited him in prison at the sulphur mines of Pozzuoli, near the volcano of Solfatara. The authorities discovered that these men were also Christians and they were thrown to the wild beasts as well, but as one modern account states, \\"...when the animals came near the Saints, they fell affectionately at their feet and refused to harm them.\\".Hieromartyr Januarius, bishop of Benevento, and his companions: Sosius, Proclus and Festus, deacons, Gantiol, Eutychius, Acutius, and Desiderius, at Puzzuoli (305) They were then condemned to be beheaded, along with Sossius. The deacon Proculus of Pozzuoli and the laymen Eutyches and Acutius protested this sentence while the other men were being led to their execution. As a result, these three were also decapitated with the others near the Solfatara, on September 19, 305.Santi Procolo, Eutiche e Acuzio Veneration His remains were first preserved at Misenum (today Miseno). After the destruction of the town by the Saracens, its population transferred to the newly founded town of Frattamaggiore. They brought the saint‚Äôs cult with them, making Sossius patron saint of the town; his relics, however, they left behind. The Benedictines recovered the relics from Miseno and preserved them at the convent of Santi Severino e Sossio, Naples. When in 910 the relics of St. Sossius, a companion of St. Januarius, were transferred to the same convent, John the Deacon wrote a history of St. Januarius and his companions, in which as an eyewitness he describes the aforesaid transfer.Acta Sanctorum, September, VI, 874 sqq.; the text of the \\"Translatio\\" alone is found in Waitz, loc. cit., 459-63. A biography of St. Nicholas of MyraEdited by Angelo, Cardinal Mai in Spicilegium Romanum, IV, 323 sqq. is not by this John but by another author of the same name. From here his veneration spread through various parts of Campania and Lazio, and even to Africa. Following the Napoleonic suppression of the convent, the remains were translated to Frattamaggiore where they are still preserved in the basilica dedicated to him. A village in the province of Avellino was established in his name as San Sossio Baronia.

A force of three Dominican schooners led by Commander Juan Bautista Cambiaso defeated a force of three vessels of the Haitian Navy. Though it was a minor naval battle engagement, it determined the naval supremacy of the Dominican Republic over Haiti until the end of the war. Prelude to battle On 31 March 1844 news from French Admiral De Moges from the frigate La Ner√©ide, warned of a flotilla of Haitian vessels that had been raiding the coast of the Ocoa Bay and transporting supplies to the Haitian Army in Azua. He recommended President Tom√°s de Bobadilla y Briones of the Junta Central Gubernativa, to order all ships in Santo Domingo be used for war. Conscripts for the new navy gathered at Puerta de la Misericordia, among them were Juan Alejandro Acosta, Jos√© Antonio Sanabia, Joaqu√≠n Orta, Teodoro Ariza, Pedro Tom√°s Garrido y Ferm√≠n Gonz√°lez. Juan Alejandro Acosta together with some fellow merchants, armed two schooners. Acosta received the schooner Eleonore (renamed San Jos√©) from the British merchant Abraham Cohen and was followed by the Genoese merchant Juan Bautista Maggiolo who received the schooner Mar√≠a Chica from the Catalan merchants Jos√© and Francisco Ginebra. Both schooners set sail in early April to Aguas de la Estancia, Ban√≠ to meet there with Commander Juan Bautista Cambiaso, another Genoese merchant.

Cambiaso leading the schooner Separaci√≥n Dominicana (flagship), the Captain Juan Bautista Maggiolo led the Mar√≠a Chica and Lieutenant Juan Alejandro Acosta led the San Jos√©. Two days later, on 15 April 1844 Commander Cambiaso sighted three vessels off shore bombarding Puerto Tortuguero, Azua. The three vessels were the Pandora, La Mouche and Le Signifie. Cambiaso quickly decided to engage the fleet and after a combination of manoeuvres the enemy succumbed. All three enemy vessels were sunk. Almost all sailors died in the battle and there is no record of any survivor from the sinkings. Aftermath News from this victory travelled fast and on 23 April 1844 the Junta Central Gubernativa authorised to incorporate these three schooners in the newly created Dominican Navy, and Commander Cambiaso was appointed to the rank of Admiral. Haitian presence at sea vanished after this engagement, which ensured naval supremacy for the newborn nation.

Marins is also known by his alter ego Z√© do Caix√£o (in English, Coffin Joe). It is one of several Marins' films that feature Joe as a major character, although it is not considered part of the \\"Coffin Joe trilogy\\" (At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul, This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse, and Embodiment of Evil). Filmed in Marins' trademark b movie style, including the use of inconsistent visual and sound editing, a bizarre audio track, and extremely low budget effects.  Plot  Playing himself, and having filmed the final scene of his most recent movie, Jose Mojica Marins gives an interview discussing his plans for his next film. After an interviewer asks Marins about the true existence of Coffin Joe, Marins replies ‚ÄúCoffin Joe does not exist‚Äù. A camera light then explodes. He states he will leave for vacation at the country home of his friend Alvaro to write the script for his next film, which he plans on calling ‚ÄúThe Demon Exorcist‚Äù. He arrives at Alvaro's. He is met there by Mr. Julio, father of Alvaro, tending his flowers. Marins is taken to the house and greeted by Alvaro, his wife Lucia, and their three daughters: Betinha, Luciana, and Vilma. Vilma is soon to be married to her fiancee Carlos. Soon odd things occur around the house and property such as winds blowing and horses being frightened, and that night Mr. J√∫lio frightens everyone when he begins tearing off his shirt and declaring in a frenzied voice that has come to collect a debt. Marins investigates the house that night and finds a locked hallway, but is attacked by flying books and the lights turn off. Betinha sees tarantulas and a snake in the Christmas tree. During these events the scene cuts to a strange woman who carries a white cat and is surrounded by occult figurines and symbols, and has a framed portrait of Coffin Joe behind her on the wall. Lucia admits to Marins that Vilma is promised to a local witch in the marriage to Eugenio, who is the son of Satan. Vilma is actually the daughter of the witch, but Lucia obtained her as a newborn due to her husband's infertility and faked the pregnancy with the promise to raise Vilma and return her as an adult for the marriage to Eugenio. The recent occurrences in the house are the result of the witch's anger at Vilma's engagement to Carlos. Carlos is injured in a mysterious car accident and Lucia faints fearing it to be the action of the witch. The scene then shows the witch biting the head off a rooster as a sacrifice. Marins then returns to his room and hears Vilma moaning in the next room. He finds Vilma wandering naked and she strikes him on the head. Marins wakens in a room with a black mass in progress. He sees the red-gowned hooded figures of Luciana, Mr. Julio and the witch, as well as Vilma and Eugenio side by side. The constant sounds of tortured screams fills the room. After the dancers raise their arms, some sparks fly and Coffin Joe appears. Marins is shocked to see his creation in flesh and blood, shouting rants and pronouncements typical of Coffin Joe, such as ‚Äúmay the blood of those who don't deserve to live burst out of their bodies!‚Äù, and ‚Äúmay lightning burn the scum!‚Äù. Coffin Joe walks up a staircase of human bodies to witness the festivities, mainly topless women dancing exotically to the constant screams of torture and terror that fill the background. When the wedding starts, Coffin Joe places the rings on Carlos' and Vilma's fingers, announcing ‚Äúmay pain and blood spread among us!‚Äù. The scenes that follow are a series of vivid depictions of torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and live cannibalism. After forcing Marins from the room, the ceremony takes place, Marins hearing it from the next room. When Marins hears the screams of the youngest daughter Betinha being taken to the ceremony in order to be sacrificed, he returns with a crucifix he found fallen from the wall, and brandishes it saying ‚ÄúI believe in God!‚Äù, preventing Betinha's murder. He then uses the crucifix to quickly exorcise the family members of their influence from Coffin Joe. Marins and Coffin Joe struggle. After Marins is knocked to the ground, a transparent image of Coffin Joe is seen leaving Marins' body. The witch and Eugenio both die as results of Marins' impromptu Christian pronouncements. Marins wakes in his room clutching the crucifix. He goes to check on the family members and sees Mr. Julio setting the table for Christmas dinner, Vilma and Carlos in a loving embrace, and Betinha and Luciana opening presents. Marins silently takes his leave as they sing Christmas carols. The film ends with a shot of Betinha's face with a serious expression. The camera zooms in to the reflection in her eye which shows Coffin Joe who is laughing amid the sounds of tortured screams.

Freehand pin striping is the most difficult method of pin striping and the brush is an important tool for design. Pinstriping brushes have several different designs: Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line brushes.A History Of The Mack Brush Company The brush consists of a small wood dowel handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and brush hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small wood dowel is balanced so pin stripers can freely spin the brush between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the brush does not hit the palm of the hand while the brush is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a pinstriping brush is relatively long at approximately 2 inches or more, compared to most artistic brushes of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line. Cleaning and storage After every use of a pinstriping brush, the brush must be cleaned in order to not damage the brush once the paint dries. The cleaning procedure consists of submerging the brush hairs in mineral spirits;Pinstriper FAQthe brush is then laid down and the brush hairs are gently worked through to remove all paint and residue. The brush hair is delicate and must be stored properly between usage. The brush should be laid flat and soaked in brush oil.

The oil field lies above the North Gas Field, one of the largest gas fields in the world. The field has been operated by Maersk Oil Qatar AS of Denmark until July 2017 under a production sharing agreement with Qatar Petroleum, on behalf of the state of Qatar. As of June 2016, Qatar Petroleum and the French major Total S.A. established a new company known as \\"North Oil Company (Qatar)\\". The new company is 70% owned by Qatar Petroleum and 30% by Total. North Oil Company took over field operations on 14 July 2017. History Though well North West Deep-2, drilled by Shell in 1974, blew out briefly from the Shaheen reservoir, the oil field was only formally discovered in 1992 by Maersk Oil. The drilling of appraisal wells was completed in 1994 using horizontal drilling techniques.Sonowal, K., Bennetzen, B., Wong, P., Isevcan, E.; \\"How Continuous Improvement Lead to the Longest Horizontal Well in the World\\", SPE/IADC 119506, Presented at the SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 17‚Äì19 March 2009. Regular oil production started the same year. In 1995‚Äì1996, production facilities were extended with subsea export pipelines, an additional single point mooring loading buoy, new process facilities and a STAR type wellhead platform. In April 2004, the extension area north of block 5 was included to the production sharing agreement. Inauguration of new offshore facilities took place on 23 February 2005. In May 2008, Maersk Oil drilled the world record extended reach well BD-04A in the field with the GSF Rig 127 operated by Transocean. The well was drilled incident free to a record measured length of including a record horizontal reach of in 36 days. From 2004 until August 2009 the massive supertanker, Knock Nevis, the largest ship built to date, was moored there as a floating storage and offloading unit (FSO). In January 2010, she was replaced by both the FSO Asia, and in August 2010, the FSO Africa replaced the Astro Canopus. Both vessels are owned as a joint venture by Overseas Shipholding Group and Euronav. In June 2016 France's Total won a tender to replace Maersk Oil as operator of Al Shaheen Oil Field and commenced operating the field on 14 July 2017 under a joint venture agreement between Total (30%) and Qatar Petroleum (70%) through a new company named North Oil Company. Geology The oil and gas producing formation is the Kharaib, Shuaiba and Nahr Umr Formations (Early Cretaceous). The field is characterized by low permeability, limited thickness, and geological complexity. Production The field consists of 131 operational production and water injection wells, 18 permanent platforms, and six production installations connected by 20 pipelines. In 2006, Al Shaheen's production of accounted for a significant portion of Qatar's total oil production of . Although the production capacity reaches , the current actual production is only due to OPEC quotas. A development plan between Maersk Oil and Qatar Petroleum calls for an increase in production to . This increase is expected to account for the majority of growth in Qatar's petroleum output over this time. Oil is currently stored in the floating storage and offloading vessels FSO Asia and FSO Africa. Produced oil is transported to the Mesaieed Industrial City for processing and export. There is a plan to build a new refinery in Mesaieed to process oil from Al Shaheen. This plan has been postponed. The Al-Shaheen field also produces associated gas. The gas production is estimated about of which is exported through the North Field Alpha facilities to Mesaieed, is consumed on-site for power and heat generation, and is flared.  Records  The Kola Superdeep Borehole was the longest and deepest borehole in the world for nearly 20 years. However, in May 2008, a new record for borehole length was established by the extended-reach drilling (ERD) well BD-04A, which was drilled by Transocean for Maersk Oil in the Al Shaheen oil field in Qatar. It was drilled to , with a record horizontal reach of in only 36 days. On 28 January 2011, Exxon Neftegas Ltd., operator of the Sakhalin-I project, drilled the world's longest extended-reach well offshore on the Russian island of Sakhalin. It has surpassed the length of both the Al Shaheen well and the Kola borehole. The Odoptu OP-11 well reached a measured total length of and a horizontal displacement of . Exxon Neftegas completed the well in 60 days. On 27 August 2012, Exxon Neftegas Ltd beat its own record by completing the Z-44 Chayvo well. This ERD well reached a measured total length of .

Primary organ systems (so-called core battery systems) are: * Central Nervous System * Cardiovascular System * Respiratory System Secondary organ systems of interest are: * Gastrointestinal System * Renal System Safety pharmacology studies are required to be completed prior to human exposure (i.e., Phase I clinical trials), and regulatory guidance is provided in ICH S7A and other documents.International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/safety/article/safety- guidelines.html Key aims of safety pharmacology The aims of nonclinical safety pharmacology evaluations are three-fold: * To protect Phase I clinical trial volunteers from acute adverse effects of drugs * To protect patients (including patients participating in Phase II and III clinical trials) * To minimize risks of failure during drug development and post-marketing phases due to undesirable pharmacodynamic effects Key issues The following key issues have to be considered within safety pharmacology: * The detection of adverse effects liability (i.e. hazard identification) * Investigation of the mechanism of effect (risk assessment) * Calculating a projected safety margin * Implications for clinical safety monitoring * Mitigation strategies (risk management) Background The first appearance of the term ‚Äòsafety pharmacology‚Äô in the published literature dates back to 1980. The term was certainly in common usage in the 1980s within the pharmaceutical industry to describe nonclinical pharmacological evaluation of unintended effects of candidate drugs for regulatory submissions.Redfern WS, Wakefield, ID (2006) Safety Pharmacology. In Toxicological Testing Handbook: Principles, Applications and Data Interpretation, 2nd edn., pp. 33-78. K Keller & D Jacobson-Kram (eds.), Taylor & Francis Ltd. Back then it was part of a wider ‚Äògeneral pharmacology‚Äô assessment, which addressed actions of a drug candidate beyond the therapeutically-intended effects. The only detailed guidelines indicating the requirements from drug regulatory authorities for general pharmacology studies were from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. Nowadays, the term ‚Äògeneral pharmacology‚Äô is no longer used, and the ICH S7A guidelinesEMA ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals. ICH Step 5: Note for Guidance on Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals. CPMP/ICH/539/00. distinguish between primary pharmacodynamics (‚Äústudies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in relation to its desired therapeutic target‚Äù), secondary pharmacodynamics (‚Äústudies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance not related to its desired therapeutic target‚Äù) and safety pharmacology (‚Äústudies that investigate the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.‚Äù). A major stimulus to the discipline of safety pharmacology was the release in 1996 of a draft ‚ÄòPoints to Consider‚Äô document on QT prolongation by the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), issued in final form the following year.Redfern WS, Wakefield ID, Prior H, Pollard, CE, Hammond TG, Valentin J-P. (2002) Safety pharmacology ‚Äì a progressive approach. Fund Clin Pharmacol 16, 161-173. This initiative had been prompted by growing concern of sudden death caused by drug-induced torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal cardiac tachyarrhythmia. Later, in 2005, this concern was addressed by issue of the ICH S7B guidelines.http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/safety/article/safety- guidelines.html Preclinical safety pharmacology Preclinical safety pharmacology integrates in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches.Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Principles of Safety Pharmacology. Editors: Pugsley, Michael K., Curtis, Michael J. (Eds.), 2015. In vitro safety pharmacology studies are focused on early hazard identification and subsequent compound profiling in order to guide preclinical in vivo safety and toxicity studies. Early compound profiling can flag for receptor-, enzyme-, transporter-, and ion channel-related liabilities of NCEs (e.g., inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go related gene protein (hERG)). Classically in vivo investigations comprise the use of young adult conscious animals. Study design Safety pharmacology studies have to be designed for defining the dose-response relationship of the adverse effect observed. Justification should be provided for the selection of the particular animal model or test system. The time course (e.g., onset and duration of response) of the adverse effect is investigated through selected time points for the measurements based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations. Generally, the doses eliciting the adverse effect have to be compared to the doses eliciting the primary pharmacodynamic effect in the test species or the proposed therapeutic effect in humans. Regulatory guidance documents (current versions) The primary reference document for safety pharmacology is ICH S7A, followed by many key regulatory documents which either focus on or mention safety pharmacology: * ICH S7A: Safety pharmacology studies for human pharmaceuticals. . * ICH S7B: Nonclinical evaluation of the potential for delayed ventricular repolarization (QT interval prolongation) by human pharmaceuticals. . * ICH S6(R1): Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. . * ICH S9: Nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals . * ICH M3(R2): Guidance on nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorisation for pharmaceuticals. . * ICH E14: Clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. . * EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004.

The Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) is a novel safety pharmacology paradigm intending to provide a more accurate assessment of cardiac safety testing for potential proarrhythmic events in human. This initiative is driven by a steering team including partners from US FDA, HESI, CSRC, SPS, EMA, Health Canada, Japan NIHS and PMDA. The CiPA includes in vitro assays coupled to in silico reconstructions of cellular cardiac electrophysiological activity with verification of relevance through comparison of drug effects in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

Background Nish was born in Burghmuirhead, Edinburgh, in 1926. War years World War II gave opportunity to many young non-Japanese to become specialists in Japanese studies, and Nish became one of them. His first encounter with Japan came when he was still an Edinburgh schoolboy. His school announced a government program for volunteers who wanted to learn difficult Oriental languages, but he was too young then to apply. Three years later ‚Äî not yet 18 but in the army and, with infantry and artillery training, posted to India ‚Äî he put in for a crash course in Japanese and was accepted.Kenrick, Vivienne. \\"Personality Profile: Ian Nish,\\" Japan Times. 18 September 2004 -- May '08. The School of Japanese Studies had been opened in an old mansion in Simla, and it later moved to Karachi. The program had strong courses in Japanese language, but nothing in Japanese history or the nature of Japanese society. With the end of the war and the end of the course, the \\"semi-linguists\\" were sent to the Southeast Asia Translation and Interrogation Center in Johore Bahru, Malaya. The course graduates were given translation duties, and were used as interpreters at Changi prison. Within a few months, Nish was ordered to Japan. In Kure, Nish found himself in the headquarters of the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Center. Amongst varied duties in the Translation Section, he was assigned to translate regional newspapers. In that role, he and others were not called upon to draw on their knowledge of the older 'kanji' which they had learned, since a working list of 1,800 characters had been specified by the Ministry of Education for use in the press from New Year's Eve, 1946. Academic career Two years later, Nish faced a choice. He could go to the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London and begin a degree in Japanese, or he could return to Edinburgh to pick up his interrupted honors degree in history. He chose the second option, and was awarded his M.A. from Edinburgh University three years later. In Japan, Nish had collected material on the Anglo-Japanese alliance which had been formalized in 1902. With that material in hand, he moved to SOAS to begin work on his doctorate. At SOAS, he became a student member of the Japan Society of London and the China Society. Nish's first academic appointment was to the history department of the University of Sydney. He spent six months in Japan on his way to Australia in 1957. He remembers that Sydney students at that time were becoming more interested in Japan. As he recalls, the courses in Asian history were ranked as popular during this period. Nish stayed in Australia until 1962. On his return to England, he embarked on 30 years of \\"congenial teaching\\" as a Japan specialist in the international history department at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Two of his specialized courses there resulted in two monograph publications: \\"Origins of the Russo-Japanese War\\" and \\"Japan's Struggle with Internationalism\\". Nish pursued his own research into the history of Anglo-Japanese relations, which led to two more books. He was an active member of the Japan Society;Japan Society, UK: Library Committee Chair, 2008 and he was secretary of the British Association for Japanese Studies (BAJS). For three years from 1985 to 1988, he was president of the European Association for Japanese Studies (EAJS).Nish, Ian. Collected Writings, Part 1, p. xii. Nish retired in 1991. He then accepted the position of honorary senior research associate of the Suntory Toyota International Centre for Economics and Related Disciplines (STICERD). This position proved invaluable in enabling Nish to complete certain research projects which were crowded out by administrative chores during his last years of teaching. In 2001-2002, two volumes of his collected writings were simultaneously published in Britain and Japan. Nish was the Honorary Chief British Coordinator of the Anglo-Japanese History Project; and, to mark the centenary of the Russo-Japanese War, compiled and introduced an eight-volume collection of important historical works and documents, The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-5 (2004). =Honors= Nish suggests that \\"a foreign scholar of Japan is often only a middleman attempting to distill the ideas of Japanese scholars\\". * Japan Academy (Honorary member), 2007.Japan Academy, Honorary member * Commander of the Order of the British Empire. * Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, 1991. * Japan Foundation: Japan Foundation Award, 1991.

The model, with measurements of 4 by 3.6 meters and 1:200 scale, was made in the interbellum period under supervision of Polish architect and art historian, Janusz Witwicki. The Panorama shows all buildings and streets that were found within city walls of the 18th century Lw√≥w. It was made of Bristol board, lead, sheet copper and wire, and colored with paints and different acids. At first, Witwicki himself financed the project, some time in mid-1930s a foundation was created, which collected money for it. In the first half of 1939 authorities of Lw√≥w decided to cover one-third of expenses, but by September 1, 1939 (see: Polish September Campaign) they gave Witwicki only 10 000 zlotys. At the beginning of World War II, models of the largest building had already been made. During Soviet (1939‚Äì1941) and German (1941‚Äì1944) occupations of the city, Witwicki worked on the model aided by some 20 persons. After the war, Soviet authorities prevented Witwicki from taking the Panorama with him to Poland. His documentation was confiscated, and is kept by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. On July 16, 1946, Witwicki died unexpectedly of unknown circumstances. It is suspected that he was murdered by the NKVD. After the death, his wife managed to take the Panorama to Warsaw, where it was secretly kept in the vaults of the National Museum by professor Stanislaw Lorentz. The Panorama was finally transported to Wroclaw, where many Polish inhabitants of Lw√≥w settled after the war. After renovation, it was featured in the Museum of Architecture in Wroclaw, but since 2003 it has been housed in a vault. Now it is presented in the Centennial Hall.

Life Jones was born in Denbighshire, Wales, near Chirk Castle, in 1628. He matriculated at All Souls College, Oxford in 1647, but transferred to Merton College before May 1648, when he appeared before the parliamentary visitors and was expelled from Oxford University for refusing to accept their authority. However, the decision was later reversed when Jones submitted (and possibly with the intervention of Sir Thomas Myddleton, who was Jones's patron) and Jesus College was ordered to admit Jones as a scholar in November 1648. He obtained a B.A. degree in 1652 and was made a Fellow of Jesus College in 1653. He was awarded his M.A. in 1654. However, his puritanical beliefs became stronger and he resigned his fellowship in 1656. After being ordained by the presbyterians in Taunton, he became vicar of Llangynwyd, Glamorgan in 1657, remaining in post for five years. In about 1660, he married and moved to Brynllywarch in Llangynwyd parish (at ), where he remained until his death. The Act of Uniformity made Jones's position intolerable and he resigned his position in 1662. He declined an offer from the Bishop of Llandaff of another position if Jones were to conform. Instead, he obtained a licence to preach under the Declaration of Indulgence of 1672, preaching at his own home and elsewhere. His good connections with local men of influence meant that he suffered relatively little. He established an academy in Brynllywarch to educate dissenting ministers, drawing good candidates given his academic reputation. The academy was later regarded as being the first dissenting academy in Wales, and its first \\"university\\" of sorts. Jones died in September 1697, and was buried on 10 September 1697 in Llangynwyd churchyard. His second wife, and three of his fourteen children, outlived him.

Industrial parks are usually located close to transport facilities, especially where more than one transport modalities coincide. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead, Sk Hwy 11, and Sk Hwy 11 are all accessed directly from Agriplace. The Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport is southwest of the Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead highway. Geography The land was annexed from the rural municipality of Corman Park between 1980 and 1984. The agriplace subdivision is nestled between three major trucking routes. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead departs Saskatoon to North Battleford to the north west. Sk Hwy 11 to Prince Albert via Warman, and Sk Hwy 12 to Blaine Lake via Martensville mark the eastern boundary. 71st Street is the northern perimeter of the industrial park. History First laid out in the early 1980s, Agriplace became well known to Saskatonians through the decision to replace the original downtown Saskatoon Arena with a new indoor arena facility. Three major locations were considered: on the site of a decommissioned power plant just west of the original Arena location (lands now part of River Landing), a site in the North Industrial district east of Idylwyld Drive, and a site in the south portion of the yet-to-be-developed Agriplace. Ultimately, Agriplace was chosen for the location of Saskatchewan Place (later renamed Credit Union Centre), an initially controversial decision due to Agriplace's remote location relative to the rest of the city and the fact accessing the area requires driving on freeways (it was not until the extension of Marquis Drive in the early 2010s that motorists from Saskatoon were given a non-freeway/non-service road option for accessing the area). At one point the City of Saskatoon also pursued plans to relocate the city's exhibition grounds onto lands adjacent to the new arena and north of 60th Street West, but public opposition and lack of space led to this plan being dropped by the late 1980s. Agriplace also received some additional notoriety when it first appeared on City maps. One of the area's major streets carries the name \\"Thatcher Avenue\\"; it appeared on maps the same year former MLA Colin Thatcher was on trial for murder, a sensational case that attracted international attention. In this case, however, the street wasn't named for Thatcher nor his father, former Saskatchewan Premier Ross Thatcher, but rather for a species of wheat, in keeping with the general naming conventions in the area. In 2003, Saunders Avenue, one of the access roads into Credit Union Centre, was renamed Bill Hunter Avenue in honor of the hockey manager and promoter who attempted to get the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League team transferred to Saskatoon in the 1980s. The renaming was noted with irony as Hunter opposed the Agriplace location of the arena. Economy The agriplace industrial park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns. Costco, a members only bulk grocery and department store, is a major employer in the agriplace district. Sasktel Centre formerly named Credit Union Centre, and Saskatchewan Place is a 12000-seat arena hosting sporting, concert and large events to Saskatoon. Canlan Ice Sports Agriplace Centre is located on Apex Street. The Husky truck stop has relocated from Circle Drive to Agriplace. Motel 6 an Tim Hortons have opened near the Husky. In the Agriplace subdivision are located 48 sectors giving employment to 780 full-time employees and 221 part-time employees.

From 1891 to 1901 he was vicar of Holy Innocents, Barbados. Rector of Saint Philip from 1901 to 1907 and dean and rector of Saint Michael, Barbados from 1907 to 1917, Berkeley was elected to be bishop and was consecrated in St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral, Barbados on 12 August 1917. On his retirement as Bishop of Barbados and the Windward Islands in 1927 he was elected as the first bishop of the Diocese of the Windward Islands, which since its formation in 1877 had been administered by the Bishop of Barbados. He was also appointed Rector of St George's Cathedral in Kingstown, St Vincent. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

One basic guidance document on this topic is the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidance E9.International Conference on Harmonization, Guidance for Industry E9, Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, 1998  Choice of analysis set  Failure to include all participants in the analysis may bias the trial results. Most trials do not yield perfect data, however. \\"Protocol violations\\" may occur, such as when the patients do not receive the full intervention or the correct intervention or a few ineligible patients are randomly allocated in error. Despite the fact that most clinical trials are carefully planned, many problems can occur during the conduct of the study. Some examples are as follows: * Patients who do not satisfy the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria are included in the trial, * A patient is randomized to Treatment A, but is treated with Treatment B, * Some patients drop out from the study, or * Some patients are not compliant, that is, do not take their medication as instructed, and so on. = As treated = As-treated analysis has the general idea of comparing the subjects by the treatment regimen that they received. It does not consider which treatment they were assigned for the treatment. = Intention to treat = Randomized clinical trials analyzed by the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach provide fair comparisons among the treatment groups because it avoids the bias associated with the non-random loss of the participants. The basic ITT principle is that participants in the trials should be analysed in the groups to which they were randomized, regardless of whether they received or adhered to the allocated intervention. However, medical investigators often have difficulties in accepting ITT analysis because of clinical trial issues like missing data or adherence to protocol. = Per protocol = This analysis can be restricted to only the participants who fulfill the protocol in terms of the eligibility, adherence to the intervention, and outcome assessment. This analysis is known as an \\"on-treatment\\" or \\"per protocol\\" analysis. A per-protocol analysis represents a \\"best-case scenario\\" to reveal the effect of the drug being studied. However, by restricting the analysis to a selected patient population, it does not show all effects of the new drug. Further, adherence to treatment may be affected by other factors that influence the outcome. Accordingly, per-protocol effects are at risk of bias, whereas the intent-to- treat estimate is not.  Handling missing data  One of the most important problems in analyzing a clinical trial is the occurrence of the dropout. Under the Declaration of Helsinki, patients in clinical trials must participate entirely voluntarily and must have the right to leave the trial at any time. This ethical imperative makes missing data an inevitable problem of clinical trials, and requires appropriate analysis methods to account for it. Since patients often drop out because they find a treatment doesn't seem to be working for them or because it causes harmful side effects, missing data is often correlated with the treatment's efficacy or safety. This type of selection bias makes a reliable assessment of a clinical trial's results particularly difficult. Methods to address missing data make assumptions about the relationship between dropout and study results in order to produce results which account for the missing data. Because the assumptions underlying a particular method may be inappropriate to a given study, care and expertise is required to address the issue. = Last observation carried forward = One method of handling missing data is simply to impute, or fill in, values based on existing data. A standard method to do this is the Last-Observation- Carried-Forward (LOCF) method. The LOCF method allows for the analysis of the data. However, recent research shows that this method gives a biased estimate of the treatment effect and underestimates the variability of the estimated result. As an example, assume that there are 8 weekly assessments after the baseline observation. If a patient drops out of the study after the third week, then this value is \\"carried forward\\" and assumed to be his or her score for the 5 missing data points. The assumption is that the patients improve gradually from the start of the study until the end, so that carrying forward an intermediate value is a conservative estimate of how well the person would have done had he or she remained in the study. The advantages to the LOCF approach are that: * It minimises the number of the subjects who are eliminated from the analysis, and * It allows the analysis to examine the trends over time, rather than focusing simply on the endpoint. However, the National Academy of Sciences, in an advisory report to the Food and Drug Administration on missing data in clinical trials, recommended against the uncritical use of methods like LOCF, stating that \\"Single imputation methods like last observation carried forward and baseline observation carried forward should not be used as the primary approach to the treatment of missing data unless the assumptions that underlie them are scientifically justified.\\" The basic assumption underlying LOCF‚Äîthat patients who are given treatments get better, which makes treating missing data as if the past had continued unchanged conservative‚Äîis often not true. Many drugs treat conditions, such as cancer, heart failure, or AIDS, in which patients are expected to get worse or die while under observation; and where success comes from maintaining the status quo, prolonging life or preventing deterioration, not from curing or improving. In addition, even curative drugs may have harmful and sometimes deadly side effects and safety problems. For these types of trial contexts, handling missing data as if the past had continued unchanged may result in overreporting efficacy or underreporting harmful safety problems, biasing the results in ways that make the investigational treatment appear safer or more efficacious than it actually is. In addition, even when they do not add inappropriate bias, simple imputation methods overestimate the precision and reliability of the estimates and the power of the trial to assess the treatment. When data is missing, the sample size on which estimates are based is lowered. Simple imputation methods fail to account for this decrease in sample size, and hence tend to underestimate the variability of the results. = Multiple imputation methods = The National Academy of Sciences advisory panel instead recommended methods that provide valid type I error rates under explicitly stated assumptions taking missing data status into account, and the use of multiple imputation methods based on all the data available in the model. It recommended more widespread use of Bootstrap and Generalized estimating equation methods whenever the assumptions underlying them, such as Missing at Random for GEE methods, can be justified. It advised collecting auxiliary data believed to be associated with dropouts to provide more robust and reliable models, collecting information about reason for drop-out; and, if possible, following up on drop-outs and obtaining efficacy outcome data. Finally, it recommended sensitivity analyses as part of clinical trial reporting to assess the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions about the missing data mechanism. While the methods recommended by the National Academy of Science report are more recently developed, more robust, and will work under a wider variety of conditions than single-imputation methods like LOCF, no known method for handling missing data is valid under all conditions. As the 1998 International Conference on Harmonization E9 Guidance on Statisticial Principles for Clinical Trials noted, \\"Unfortunately, no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended.\\" Expert statistical and medical judgment must select the method most appropriate to the particularly trial conditions of the available imperfect techniques, depending on the particular trial's goals, endpoints, statistical methods, and context.

Diplomatically, an Apostolic Nuncio may be equivalent to an ambassador, and often carries the ecclesial title of archbishop. The nuncio works closely with the Archdiocese of Manila, and is by custom the Dean of the diplomatic corps. History The Apostolic Nunciature in the Philippines was erected circa 1902. Though the official residence of the nuncio is located in Manila, he is not subject to the Archbishop of Manila. = World War II = When the Philippines was caught in World War II following the commencement of the Japanese Invasion of East Asia, communication between the Holy See and the Philippine Delegation (Msgr. Guglielnao Piani, SDB), or any of the other delegations of the region, was not permitted. However, the Apostolic Delegation in Tokyo (Msgr. Paolo Marella) was permitted to communicate with the censored delegations. In 1943, the Second Philippine Republic was inaugurated. In a letter dated October 14, 1943 (the day of the inauguration), the newly elected President of the puppet government, Jose P. Laurel, wrote to Luigi Cardinal Maglione, the Vatican Secretary of State: Although, Cardinal Maglione received the telegram, he told the Japanese Ambassador to the Holy See, Ken Harada, that as long as the war continues, the Holy See will not recognize any new states, including the new Philippine Republic. Harada acknowledged the Holy See's decision and did not pursue the matter further. Later, Cardinal Maglione directed Msgr. Piani, through Msgr. Marella, to continue to pursue and protect the interests of the Catholic religion in the country. He added that the local bishops are permitted to deal with local ecclesiastical affairs as long as they are not diplomatic in character. However, they could, if necessary, appeal to the authorities on affairs that are purely ecclesiastical. The Apostolic Delegation helped clear up a misunderstanding that Msgr. Paul Taguchi, Archbishop of Osaka, visited Manila not to supplant the authority of the Archbishop of Manila but to establish contacts with the Catholics of that city. Rumors were also spreading that Pope Pius XII personally communicated a telegram to Laurel. Maglione clarified via a letter to the Apostolic Delegate in London that since the Holy See did not recognize any new states for the duration of the war, no such telegram was ever sent. Role in the hierarchy: vicariates Monsignor Giuseppe Pinto, Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines (fourth from left seated) at the Good Friday Processions of Baliuag, Bulacan. As an apostolic vicar, the nuncio also serves a role in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. An apostolic vicariate is a territorial jurisdiction established in areas which do not have a diocese and the nuncio serves as metropolitan bishop to these vicariates. In the Philippines, the apostolic vicariates are: *Apostolic Vicariate of Bontoc- Lagawe *Apostolic Vicariate of Calapan *Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo *Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa *Apostolic Vicariate of San Jos√© in Mindoro *Apostolic Vicariate of Tabuk *Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay List of papal representatives to the Philippines = Apostolic Delegates = In 1900 a Papal Legation with the rank of Apostolic Delegation in the Philippines was established. * Placide Louis Chapelle (1900 - 1901) * Donato Sbarretti (16 September 1901 - 26 December 1902, appointed Apostolic Delegate to Canada) * Giovanni Battista Guidi (1902 - 27 June 1904, died in office) * Ambrose Agius, O.S.B.

It is an alphanumeric code of 16 characters. The code serves to unambiguously identify individuals residing in Italy irrespective of residency status. Designed by and for the Italian tax office, it is now used for several other purposes, e.g. uniquely identifying individuals in the health system, or natural persons who act as parties in private contracts. The code is issued by the Italian tax office, the Agenzia delle Entrate. In the past, each person in Italy was handed a plastic card with a magnetic strip, bearing the tax code as well as the surname, given name(s), sex, place and province of birth (or country of birth if foreign), date of birth and date of issue. Today, the fiscal code card has been replaced by a combined Italian health insurance card for qualifying residents which shows an expiration date. Fiscal code generation The laws covering the calculation of a fiscal code were put in place by the Ministry of Economy and Finances on December 23, 1976. For natural persons, the fiscal code is made of 16 alphanumeric characters; for legal persons (e.g. corporations) it comprises 11 numeric-only characters. While it is possible to calculate one's tax code, the only official tax code is the one provided by the tax office, which avoids cases of identical tax codes (which is a frequent case for people not born in Italy, as in this case the 4-characters town code in the codice fiscale is replaced by \\"Z\\" followed by a 3-digit country code) as well as cases where a code is incorrect, but still valid (because provided by the tax office). The algorithm that follows is used to generate natural persons' fiscal codes. ; Surname (3 letters): the first three consonants of the surname are used. If there is more than one surname, both are considered as if they were one. If the surname has less than three consonants, then vowels will replace the blank spaces, in the same order they appear in the surname (e.g. \\"Rossi\\" would be RSS, \\"Masi\\" would be MSA). If the whole surname has less than three letters, the blank spaces are replaced with an X (e.g. \\"Fo\\" would be FOX, \\"Hu\\" would be HUX). The surname used is always the name that appears in the person's primary identification document: for native Italians, this is the carta d'identit√† (identity card). :* It is important to note that in Italy women do not 'officially' change their surnames when they marry: therefore, a woman does not require a new fiscal code (or identity card, or passport) if she already has one at the time of her marriage. However, when a woman obtains a fiscal code after she is married (generally, this applies only to foreigners born outside Italy) then the surname that appears in her primary identification document (usually, her passport) must be used to produce the fiscal code: in many cases, this will be the surname of her husband. ; First name (3 letters): the first three consonants of the name are used. If there is more than one name, both are considered as if they were one. If the name has less than three consonants, then vowels will replace the blank spaces, in the same order they appear in the name (e.g. \\"Marco\\" would be MRC, \\"Paola\\" would be PLA). If the whole name has less than three letters, the blank spaces are filled with an X (e.g. Chinese name \\"Na\\" would be NAX). Some indian immigrants in Italy are registered with a triple X instead of their first name, since their passport only indicates a single word which is used as a surname by the Italian register office. If the name has more than three consonants, the 2nd is skipped (e.g. \\"Riccardo\\" would be RCR; \\"Martina\\" would be MTN). This second- consonant skipping rule for names that have more than three consonants is only used for first names, not for surnames. ; Birthdate and gender (5 alphanumeric characters) :Year of birth (two digits): the last two year of birth digits are used (e.g. \\"1972\\" would be 72); :Month of birth (one letter): each single month is associated with one letter, as shown in the table: { table width=100%  width=50% valign=\\"top\\"  { align=center style=\\"font-size: 90%; border-collapse:collapse\\" border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=6 - align=center bgcolor=lightgreen LetterMonthLetterMonthLetterMonth - align=center A January E May P September - align=center B February H June R October - align=center C March L July S November - align=center D April M August T December } } :Birthday and gender (2 digits): the two birthday digits are used (from 01 to 31); if the person is a woman, 40 is added (e.g. 01 would be 41, 31 would be 71). ; Town of birth (4 alphanumeric characters) : the so called Belfiore code is used as codice catastale (registry code), which comprises one letter, then three digits. Each single Italian town (comune) has its own code, which is mostly determined by alphabetical order (e.g. Abano Terme in the province of Padua, the 1st Italian comune in alphabetical order, has the code A001). People born in a foreign country have their own code according to the country of birth, all of them beginning with letter Z (e.g. United States code is Z404, the UK code is Z114, Australia is Z700, etc.).

He is married and has three children: a son, Rolando Reyes Jr., and two daughters, Oneida Reyes-Diez and Seida Reyes. Early life Rolando Reyes was born in 1924 into a large family of fourteen (seven boys and seven girls,Reyes Family Cigar company history in Zulueta, Las Villas Province, Cuba (now in Villa Clara Province). His father owned a trucking business, but unlike his siblings, he wished to become a tabacalero, a tobacconist.

Partag√°s factory, Havana Cuba Developing a Career in the Cigar Industry In 1938, at the age of 14, he went to work at the Jos√© L. Piedra Cigar Factory in Guanajay, Pinar del R√≠o Province, but later moved to Havana, Cuba to begin work at the H. Upmann factory. After leaving Upmann, he went to work in various factories, including Jos√© Gener, Partag√†s, Romeo y Julieta and then he worked for the Batet Cigar Co. It was in these factories that he learned to roll the parejo (straight-sided) cigars. He learned to roll more complex and difficult figurados (shaped cigars), such as pyramides at the Jos√® Gener factory. He was able also to master the technique of rolling cigars without a mold and other techniques as well., He was later the first to offer the complex diadema (a large figurado) to the U. S. market. Striking Out on His Own In 1945, barely 21 years of age, Rolando moved to Placetas, Las Villas province, and established his own factory, Los Aliados. After a few years, he moved his factory to Havana where he operated successfully until 1968 when the Communist government of Fidel Castro confiscated his Los Aliados trademark, his factory and his personal belongings. At the time of the takeover, the factory was turning out 6 million hand-made cigars for the domestic market. The new government assigned him to work in the El Rey del Mundo cigar factory, but he refused so he was sent to the rice fields where he worked until he was able to emigrate to the United States. Starting Anew In 1971, Rolando Reyes Sr. was able to emigrate to the United States, arriving first in Miami, Florida. A short time later, with a $500 loan from his brother, he re-located his family to Jersey City, New Jersey and opened a small cigar shop. He worked in a clothing factory during the day (knitting) to earn extra money to support his family and rolled cigars for sale in his shop in the evenings. The Jersey City location soon proved to be too small, so in 1973, he built a combination house/factory in Union City and moved his family and cigar production there changing the name of his cigar to Cuba Aliados. The company continues to operate offices in Union City. Cuba Aliados Anniversary 1924 cigar band. Image by Richard L. Hardesty The newly re-christened cigar was picked up by a national distributor (Cigars by Santa Clara). To keep up with the increased demand, in 1978, Reyes Sr. began production of Cuba Aliados in the Dominican Republic. Unsatisfied with the quality of the resultant cigars, he closed his Dominican operation and opened a new factory and retail operation in Miami, Florida in 1984, and cigar production continued in both Union City and Miami until all production moved to Honduras. The Advent of Puros Indios The success of the Cuba Aliados brand had its bumps due to litigation with JR Cigars that built a gap between Rolando Reyes Jr. and Rolando Reyes Sr. A new brand, Puros Indios, was introduced in late 1995 by Rolando Reyes Jr. Rolando Reyes Jr. Promoted came out with the Puros Indios name. It was under Puros Indios Cigars that Rolando Reyes Jr purchased the 35 Acre land in the Redlands. He moved into the main house with a ten-acre parcel with mother, Zeida Reyes. He wanted sister's Oneida and Seida to occupy the remaining acres. Zeida Reyes lived in the main house for many years with daughter Seida Reyes. When Seida Reyes moved out of the main home, Oneida Reyes insisted on moving into the property, threw out older brother that resided in the ten acres, and took charge of the property. She moved her mother to live in the stables in the back of the property which was in poor conditions. She took over the land and now resides in the property with husband Enriquez Diez. Rolando Reyes Jr. promoted the Puros Indios Cigars and it was not well accepted by the Cuba Aliados Cigars Distributor known as JR. Distributors.

In February 1996, Rolando Reyes Jr. formed a new company, Puros Indios Cigars, Inc.,Florida Secretary of State filings which took over the production and distribution of the Puros Indios brand. The dispute and lawsuit also resulted in a permanent rift between father and son that was later overcome and Rolando Reyes Junior returned to work at the Miami office. Ongoing conflicts with sister Oneida forced him to leave the company and initiate business elsewhere. The family business which was run by every member of the family was overtaken by Oneida and her sons. Rolando Reyes Jr.,Savona, David. The Return of Cuba Aliados, Cigar Aficionado online, 22 Nov.

Hardesty The suit was settled in late 1999, with the distribution rights to Cuba Aliados returned to Cigars by Santa Clara and Sr. Reyes' company, Puros Indios Cigars, Inc., retaining the distribution rights to the Puros Indios brand, thus returning Cuba Aliados cigars to market. In 2004, the distribution rights to the Cuba Aliados brand were regained by Sr. Reyes, once again giving him full control of all his established brands.Cuba Aliados Cigars Now Feature Corojo Wrapper, Brand News, Smokeshop Magazine online, April 2004. Last accessed 05/09/2008 Honduras A visit to Honduras convinced Sr. Reyes to move most of his operations to Danl√≠, Honduras, the move was completed in 1989. The factory was an old building that had originally been a twelve-room motel.Marsh, Mike. Puros Indios Opens New Factory, Cigar Aficionado online, 22 July 2002. Last accessed 4/30/2008 This factory was in use for fourteen years. It eventually became too small, until a new, fully modern factory was built on the outskirts of Danlƒ∫, which opened in 2002. The old factory continues to serve as a box factory and as an aging facility for finished cigars. The new Puros Indios factory allowed for an immediate increase in production to three times what the old factory could produce, turning out 30,000 cigars per day. The rolling room, with room for 160 rollers, occupies the entire bottom floor. The second floor consists of 15 bulk tobacco storage rooms, seven cedar-lined aging rooms and three walk-in freezers for killing tobacco pests such as the Tobacco Beetle. The factory sits on a plot of land adjacent to the Reyes residence and farm, where Don Rolando grows food for himself and his family. He also often shares the output from this farm with his workers. Even at his advanced age (he turned 84 in 2007), Don Rolando works in the factory. Even though he works during the day, he also works after everyone else has gone home and he has the factory to himself, usually starting at 10 PM (2200 hrs) and often working to 5:00 AM (0500 hrs) the following morning. He prefers this time because it makes it easier to work without interruption. He inspects the day's production and if a roller fails to make cigars to quality standard, Don Rolando will leave the roller a cautionary note to improve. Changes This is a family business originated by Mr. Rolando Reyes Senior, wife Zeida Reyes, son and Rolando Reyes Junior. Rolando's son Rolando Jr. was the CEO of the company in Miami, New Jersey and Honduras for many years. There were some conflicts in the family initiated by sibling rivalry, and Rolando Junior went on his own. However, he was always in contact with father and received merchandise from the Honduras central office. Rolando's daughter, Seida Reyes Perez also ran the family business for a period of time but left the business to pursue her career in social services. The oldest daughter, Oneida Diez stayed kept on running the business and ultimately engaged her husband Enrique Diez to run the business with her. In late 2007, Don Rolando announced he was promoting his grandson, Carlos E. Diez, to be the company president. After many years doing business as Puros Indios Cigars, Inc., the new president changed the company name to Reyes Family Cigars, Inc., introduced a new corporate logo, cigar label art, and added three new cigar lines under the Reyes Family Cigar brand among other significant changes.Savona, David. Puros Indios Changes Name, Will Cut Sizes. Cigar Insider, Vol. 12, No. 23, 4 Dec 2007, pg. 6.Puros Indios Becomes Reyes Family Cigar CigarWeekly.com 30 Nov 2007. Last accessed 5/12/2008., Recently, Reyes Family Cigars opened up production in Miami late in 2008 to allow the domestic operations staff to personally oversee an exclusive, limited development of the Cuba Aliados Miami. Rolando Reyes died March 10, 2012, leaving behind his wife, in a nursing home, son Rolando Reyes Jr., daughter Seida Reyes Perez, and Oneida Diez. Three years later, May 2015 Zeida Reyes died without an announcement. She was hardly recognized but she was the strength behind Rolando's success. She was a dedicated mother, wife, and co-owner of the family business and properties. Rolando and Zeida Reyes worked side by side long hours to leave a legacy for their three children. They wanted to give their children the American dream. They worked so that in old age, their children would not have to struggle like they did. Rolando Reyes Jr. worked long hours alongside Rolando and Zeida. Rolando Jr. and Seida would go to work with parents straight from school. Rolando Jr. would often fall asleep while learning to roll the cigars. Seida Reyes worked side by side with mother putting the cellophane or rings in the cigars while Rolando Sr. and Junior prepared the cigars in the lower floor for the following day. Oneida Diez was home sleeping because she was allergic to the cigars and refused to work in the family business. This went on for years. Rolando Jr. eventually learned how to run the family business and became very successful in the tobacco industry. He was able to do what his father never did, to break through the traditional mom and pop store and take the business internationally. That is how the business grew which gave the opportunity to purchase a two family home located at 329 48th street. Rolando Reyes Sr. converted the front part of the home into the business. Rolando Sr. purchased a vacation home located in 111 NW 22nd street with the idea of converting the lower floor into a second business which was later named Puros Indios Cigars. The business was run by Rolando Jr. and later by Oneida Diez. However, due to ongoing conflicts between Oneida and mother Zeida, Rolando sr. demanded that Oneida leave the store. Rolando Jr. convinced parents to allow Oneida to return to work at the store and to pay off her home so that the children would not endure financial hardships. Many conflicts ensued throughout the years. Ugly family conflicts that went on for years. It was all due to struggle for power and money, something that Rolando and Zeida never taught them. Rolando and Zeida always tried to keep the peace between the family. Zeida always asked the children to love one another and to remember that they are family. Throughout the years, the conflicts worsened and eventually Rolando Jr. was forced to leave the company, was unable to find work in the tobacco industry because sister wrote letters using father's name to employers. Rolando Jr. was able to get up on his feet and start a new business away from the family. After Zeida Reyes died three years ago, Oneida said that she would distribute the inheritance in equal parts, but she had to sell the properties. Three years later, she sold the properties and did not distribute the inheritance. She kept the inheritance to herself knowing that Rolando and Zeida Reyes worked all of their life to leave the tobacco legacy to their son Rolando Reyes Jr, the family business and properties to the three children, not one child. It is sad that in what initiated as a close family converted into a rivalry for money, power and fortune. It is said that Rolando and Zeida Reyes had faith that Oneida would do the right thing by distributing the inheritance in equal parts, but she failed to carry out their wishes.

The name Redones ('charriot-drivers') stems from the Gaulish root rƒìdo- ('riding horseback, driving a horse-led chariot, travelling'), ultimately from Proto-Celtic *rƒìdo- ('the act of riding, chariot'; compare with Old Irish r√≠ad 'riding, driving a horse, voyage'; Gallo-Latin rƒìda 'chariot'). The city of Rennes, attested as civitas Redonum ca. 400 AD ('civitas of the Redones'; Redonis civitate in the 9th c. AD; Rennes in 1294) is named after the Gallic tribe.  Geography  In the Celtogalatia Lugdunensis of Ptolemy (ii. 8. ¬ß 12), he placed them west of the Senones and along the Liger (modern Loire River). But other authors contend that the Redones were not on the Loire. Pliny (iv. 18) enumerates the Redones among the peoples of Gallia Lugdunensis: Diablindi, Rhedones, Turones.  History  After the bloody fight on the Sambre (57 BCE) Julius Caesar sent Publius Licinius Crassus with a single legion into the country of the Veneti, Redones, and other Celtic tribes between the Seine River and the Loire, all of whom submitted. (B. G. ii. 34.) Caesar here enumerates the Redones among the maritime states whose territory extends to the Atlantic Ocean. In 52 BCE the Redones with their neighbors sent a contingent to attack Caesar during the siege of Alesia. In this passage also (B. G. vii. 75), the Redones are enumerated among the states bordering on the ocean, which in the Celtic language were called the Armoric States. D'Anville supposes that their territory extended beyond the limits of the diocese of Rennes into the dioceses of St. Malo and Dol-de-Bretagne.
