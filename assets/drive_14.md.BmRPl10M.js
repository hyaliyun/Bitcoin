It was formed three times. First Formation 1918–1941 The division was formed by an order of the Moscow Military District and was based on the 5th Moscow Infantry Division, 1st Infantry Division in Tula, 2nd Infantry Division in Tambov and the 5th Infantry Division in Kaluga. In September 1918 it was named the 8th Infantry Division. On 11 October 1918, it was renamed the 8th Rifle Division. The division received a number of awards between the 1920s and 1930s. On 8 December 1921 it was given the name \\"Minsk.\\" On 29 February 1928 it was awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner on the 10th anniversary of the Red Army. On 26 July 1926 it was named \\"Dzerzhinsky,\\" and in 1932 was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. A reference to being 'formed at Semipalatinsk prior to 1936' in Poirer and Connor's Red Army Order of Battle remains unconfirmed by Russian sources, suggesting that said rumours are indeed false. The unit's full title appears to have become the 8th Minsk Red Banner Order of Red Banner of Labor Dzerzhinsky Rifle Division. Brigade Commander Vladimir Kolpakchi took command of the unit in 1937. The division took part in the Polish Campaign as part of the 16th Rifle Corps, 11th Army. Brigade Commander Fursin(?) held command from December 1940 (1939?) to 4 February 1940. On 22 January 1940, it was part of the 13th Rifle Corps of the Northwestern Front during the Winter War, but had been shifted to the 23rd Rifle Corps by 31 January 1940. On 5 February 1940 Brigade Commander Fedor Dmitrievich Rubtsov took command. On 8 March 1940 it was part of the Northwestern Front's 15th Rifle Corps. On 27 April 1940 Colonel Nicholas I. Fomin took command from Rubtsov. On 22 June 1941, it was part of the 1st Rifle Corps, 10th Army, itself part of the Western Front. Major components at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa seem to have included the 151st, 229th, and 310th Rifle Regiments, the 62nd Light Artillery Regiment, the 117th Howitzer Artillery Regiment, and the 2nd Reconnaissance Company. During the Second World War it was part of the 'Operational Army' from 22 June 1941 to 4 July 1941. The division was stationed at Łomża. In accordance with the Western Special Military District covering plan, the division was to take up positions in the Osovetsky Fortified Region and along the 1939 state border with German- occupied Poland in the areas of Shchuchin, Brzozowo, Ptak, and Servatki. On the first day of the war the Division HQ came under aerial bombardment. On 23 June 1941 the Division held the front in the Ščučyn region as well. On 25 June 1941 the division conduct a withdrawal while the Białystok and, because the prisoners were rounded up. On 27 June 1941, at the headquarters of the front had no information not only about the division, but also on 10th Army, which included the division. By 1 July 1941 the division was still part of 1st Rifle Corps, but 1st Rifle Corps had been diverted directly to the Western Front. In early July, the division was destroyed in the Białystok area, as part of the German encirclement west of MinskCraig Crofoot, Armies of the Bear but unorganized resistance continued until the end of July. The division was officially disbanded on 19 September 1941. Second Formation 1941 The division was ordered to reform in 1941.See :ru:8-я стрелковая дивизия (2-го формирования) On 2 July 1941 the division reformed in the Krasnopresnensky District of Moscow, as the 8th Krasnopresnenskaya Peoples' Militia Rifle Division under the command of the Moscow Military District. The division contained an unusually large number of writers, musicians and historians; the writers were put together in the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 24th Rifle Regiment, which became known as the \\"Writers' Company\\".Rodric Braithwaite, Moscow 1941, Vintage Books, New York, 2007, p 109 By 10 July 1941, the regiments of the division had moved to the forest near Nicholas Urupino and Buzlanova. In late July, the division engaged in the fortification of defensive lines on the Mozhaysk line of defense. From at least 1 August 1941 to its destruction, the division was part of the 32nd Army, itself part of the Reserve Front. On 4 August 1941 the division took positions on the Rzhev-Vyazma line of defence, and from 30 August 1941, in positions on the eastern shore of the Dnieper River as well. On 24 August 1941 the formation was formally renamed the 8th Rifle Division. It included the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Rifle Regiments. In October, in connection with the beginning of the German Operation Typhoon it moved to the east of Yelnya. The division entered combat on 4 October 1941, the next day, 5 October 1941, losing more than half of its personnel. On 6 October 1941 it was cut off from the main organs of the regiments. Some of the division's surviving fighters were able to join partisan units. While the division was effectively destroyed on 6–7 October 1941 it was not formally disbanded until 30 November 1941. Third Formation The Third Formation of the 8th Rifle Division traces its origins to the 458th Rifle Division, which was formed in Semipalatinsk and Ayaguz in the Central Asian Military District on 25 December 1941. In early 1942 it was redesignated as the 8th Rifle Division.See :ru:8-я стрелковая дивизия (3-го формирования) Its rifle regiments, using the same numbers as the first formation, were the 151st, 229th, and 310th. Its full name became the 8th Yampol Red Banner Order of Suvorov Rifle Division, after winning the honorific Yampol. On 1 April 1942 the division was part of the Stavka Reserve. By 1 July 1942 it had been assigned to the Bryansk Front's 42nd Army. By 1 October it was part of 13th Army, and stayed assigned to that formation On 1 July 1943 it was assigned to the Soviet Central Front's 13th Army, as part of the 15th Rifle Corps. It participated in the Voronezh-Kastornoye, Eastern Carpathians, and the Prague offensives, the Battle of Kursk, the crossing of the Dnieper and the Desna and Pripyat Rivers. It defended Mtsensk, participated in the liberation of Kromy, Nevel, Novgorod-Seversky, and Chernigov.

History  The Pennsylvania Leadership Conference was founded in 1989 by a group of conservative activists, including Charlie Gerow, Susan Staub, Jim Panyard, Don Eberly, and John Fluharty, seeking to strengthen the conservative \\"grassroots lobby\\" in Pennsylvania. The first conference attracted 300 attendees and featured speakers including Congressmen Robert Smith Walker and Newt Gingrich and State Representatives Joseph R. Pitts and Howard L. Fargo. The Philadelphia Inquirer described it as an \\"anti-left nirvana.\\" The conference was scheduled during the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania meeting in Erie, leading commentators to speculate that it was intended to drain support from eventual Republican nominee for Pennsylvania Governor Barbara Hafer because of her pro-choice stance. However, conference organizers denied such an ulterior motive.  Conference presidents and speakers  Following the first meeting, the Pennsylvania Leadership Council was founded to coordinate the conference's annual organization, with Lowman S.

Life Born in Amarah, Wali fled Iraq in 1980 after the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War.http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1070727.htmlhttp://www.signandsight.com/features/1698.html He lives in Hamburg. Wali has published seven books. He is a correspondent for Al Hayathttp://www.hr- online.de/website/rubriken/kultur/index.jsp?rubrik=42836&key;=standard_rezension_36014310 and has written in Süddeutsche Zeitung,http://www.signandsight.com/features/1160.html Die Zeit, Neue Zürcher Zeitung,http://www.nzz.ch/2007/03/17/fe/articleF0ETY.html and elsewhere. In 2009 he published \\"Reise in das Herz des Feindes\\" (\\"Journey into the Heart of the Enemy\\"), an account of his travels in Israel, which presented a positive view of the country. Officially Najem Wali was – as with millions of Iraqis – born on July 1, 1956. But the truth is that he was born on October 20, 1956 in the south of Iraq. This is just one of many stories in the country of thousand and one dictatorship und thousand and more wars. Having finished his A-Levels in Basra and Amara (his official places of birth, by the way) he began his studies of German Literature at the University of Baghdad. Having passed his university degrees in 1978 he was drafted for military service. In 1980 and during the military service he was arrested and tortured as a \\"dissenter\\" and \\"opponent of war\\". A miracle made him come clear and he continued the military service up to his discharge in August 1980. Not long after the Iran–Iraq War started on September 22, 1980 young men in his age were drafted again. He didn't want to go to war, so he decided to leave the country. It wasn't easy to get an exit visa, not least because his name was on the list of people who were not allowed to leave the country. But with the help of bribe and some friends he was able leave Iraq half legally half illegally. He came to the Federal Republic of Germany on November 8, 1980 where he continued his studies of German Language and Literature and obtained the degree of Magister Artium. His thesis dealt with Jakob Michael Reinhold Maria Lenz's Der Hofmeister und die Soldaten und die neuen Interpretationen bei Bertold Brecht und Heiner Kipphardt. In 1987 Najem Wali went to Madrid to study Spanish literature. In 1990 he returned to Hamburg. Several study visits followed, for example to Oxford in 1993 and to Florence in 1995. Najem Wali started writing early. He wrote his first story in the age of 16 and began to work as a journalist for Radio Bagdhad and a weekly magazine when he was still a student. His novel The Journey to Tell al-Lahm was published by Carl Hanser publishing in 2004 and by DTV in 2010. Having become a bestseller and been reprinted several times – especially in the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt, the book soon advanced to a cult novel. On behalf of the IOM (International Organisation for Migration) Najem Wali helped to organize the first Iraqi elections (January and February 2005) from his German exile. In 2002 he accompanied Günter Grass on his journey to Yemen and took part in many international meetings and conferences, for the last time at the University of Haifa in March 2007 in a meeting themed \\"Quo Vadis Iraq?\\" Today Najem Wali mainly lives in Berlin and works as a freelance author, journalist and culture correspondent of the most important Arabic daily newspaper Al Hayat, as well as Al Mada and the Tattoo Magazine which are based in Baghdad. His books have been translated into several languages. Najem Wali also writes for well known German-language newspapers on a regular basis, such as the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, and Die Zeit.

France–Asia relations span a period of more than two millennia, starting in the 6th century BCE with the establishment of Marseille by Greeks from Asia Minor, and continuing in the 3rd century BCE with Gaulish invasions of Asia Minor to form the kingdom of Galatia and Frankish Crusaders forming the Crusader States. Since these early interactions, France has had a rich history of contacts with the Asian continent. Antiquity Vix krater, an imported Greek wine-mixing vessel dated to around 500 BCE attests to the trade exchanges of the period. The Phoenicians had an early presence around Marseille in southern France. Phoenician inscriptions have been found there. History of Phoenicia by Canon George Rawlinson p. 243 The oldest city of France, Marseille, was formally founded in 600 BCE by Greeks from the Asia Minor city of Phocaea (as mentioned by Thucydides Book 1, 13, Strabo, Athenaeus and Justin) as a trading port under the name Μασσαλία (Massalia). The Cambridge ancient history p. 754 A history of ancient Greece Claude Orrieux p. 62 These eastern Greeks, established on the shores of southern France, were in close relations with the Celtic inhabitants of France, and Greek influence and artifacts penetrated northwards along the Rhône valley. The site of Vix in northern Burgundy became an active trading center between Greeks and natives, attested by the discovery of Greek artifacts of the period. The mother city of Phocaea would ultimately be destroyed by the Persians in 545 BCE, further reinforcing the exodus of the Phocaeans to their settlements of the Western Mediterranean. A history of ancient Greece Claude Orrieux p. 61 The ancient mariners Lionel Casson p. 74 Populations intermixed, becoming half-Greek and half-indigenous. Trading links were extensive, in iron, spices, wheat and slaves, and with tin being imported to Marseille overland from Cornwall. A history of ancient Greece Claude Orrieux p. 63 The Greek settlements permitted cultural interaction between the Greeks and the Celts, and in particular helped develop an urban way of life in Celtic lands, contacts with sophisticated Greek methods, as well as regular East-West trade. A history of ancient Greece Claude Orrieux p. 65 Overland trade with Celtic countries declined around 500 however, with the troubles following the end of the Halstatt civilization. Location of Galatia in Anatolia. The Dying Gaul, an ancient Roman marble copy of a lost ancient Greek statue, thought to have been executed in bronze, commissioned some time between 230 and 220 BCE by Attalus I of Pergamon to honour his victory over the Galatians, also called Gallo- Graeci. Because of demographic pressure, the Senones Gauls departed from Central France under Brennus to sack Rome in the Battle of the Allia c. 390 BCE. A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar W. W. How p. 85 Expansion continued eastward, into the Aegean world, with a huge migration of Eastern Gauls appearing in Thrace, north of Greece, in 281 BCE in the Gallic invasion of the Balkans, favoured by the troubled rule of the Diadochi after Alexander the Great. A part of the invasion crossed over to Anatolia and eventually settled in the area that came to be named after them, Galatia. The invaders, led by Leonnorius and Lutarius, came at the invitation of Nicomedes I of Bithynia, who required help in a dynastic struggle against his brother Zipoites II. Three tribes crossed over from Thrace to Asia Minor. They numbered about 10,000 fighting men and about the same number of women and children, divided into three tribes, Trocmi, Tolistobogii and Tectosages (from the area of Toulouse in southern France). They were eventually defeated by the Seleucid king Antiochus I, in a battle where the Seleucid war elephants shocked the Celts. While the momentum of the invasion was broken, the Galatians were by no means exterminated. Instead, the migration led to the establishment of a long-lived Celtic territory in central Anatolia, which included the eastern part of ancient Phrygia, a territory that became known as Galatia.The Cambridge Ancient History: The last age of the Roman Republic p. 131 A history of all nations, from the earliest periods to the present Samuel Griswold Goodrich p. 288 There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. In 189 BCE Rome sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians. He defeated them. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BCE onward.Rome's Mediterranean empire: books forty-one to forty-five and the Periochae by Livy, Jane D.

They settled in the regions of Aquitaine and Poitou, which at one point was even called Thifalia or Theiphalia (Theofalgicus) in the 6th century, with remaining place names such as Tiffauges.Merovingian military organization, 481–751 by Bernard S.

The general path of the Hun forces in the invasion of Gaul In 450 Attila proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse, making an alliance with Emperor Valentinian III in order to do so. Attila gathered his vassals—Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Scirians, Heruls, Thuringians, Alans, Burgundians, among others and began his march west. In 451 he arrived in Belgica with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong. J.B. Bury believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom – already the strongest on the continent – across Gaul to the Atlantic Ocean.J.B. Bury, The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians, lecture IX (e-text) On 7 April, Attila captured Metz. Saint Genevieve is believed to have saved Paris.

These contacts followed an intense conflict between the Carolingians and the Umayyads, marked by the landslide Battle of Tours in 732, and were aimed at establishing a counter–alliance with the distant Abbasid Empire. There were numerous embassies between Charlemagne and the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid from 797, apparently in view of a Carolingian-Abbasid alliance against Byzantium,Charlemagne, Muhammad, and the Arab roots of capitalism by Gene W.

Over several centuries Europe absorbed knowledge from the Islamic civilization, but also knowledge from India or lost knowledge from the ancient Greeks which was being retransmitted by the Arabs.

Helaine Selin, p. 1 as well as the abacus in France and Christian Europe.Fletcher, p. 55 France and the Near East (16th-19th centuries) Between the 16th and 19th century, France had at times a relatively dormant relation with the Near East (or Western Asia), while at other times was closely politically intertwined. Relations with the region were mostly dominated through the two empires that ruled the area, namely the rivaling Ottoman Empire, and the various Persian dynasties between these centuries (Safavids, Afsharids, and Qajars). The rivalry between the French, British, and Russians was a key factor in foreign policies for the French for the region, finding themselves at times allied with the Turks or Persians. Franco-Ottoman alliance (16th–18th centuries) Francis I (left) and Suleiman the Magnificent (right) initiated a Franco-Ottoman alliance from the 1530s. Under the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire, and to set up instruction in the Arabic language, through the instruction of Guillaume Postel at the Collège de France. Eastern and Learning: the Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England by G. J. Toomer p. 26 A Franco-Ottoman alliance was established in 1536 between the king of France Francis I and the Turkish ruler of the Ottoman Empire Suleiman the Magnificent following the critical setbacks which Francis had encountered in Europe against Charles V. The alliance has been called \\"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\\". Kann, p. 62 It caused a scandal in the Christian world,Miller, p. 2 and was designated as \\"the impious alliance\\", or \\"the sacrilegious union of the Lily and the Crescent\\"; nevertheless, it endured since it served the objective interests of both parties. Merriman, p. 133 The French forces, led by François de Bourbon and the Ottoman forces, led by Barbarossa, joined at Marseille in August 1543,A New General Biographical Dictionary, Volume III by Hugh James Rose and collaborated to bombard the city of Nice in the Siege of Nice. In this action 110 Ottoman galleys, amounting to 30,000 men,Lamb, p. 228 combined with 50 French galleys.The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 328 The Franco-Ottomans laid waste to the city, but met a stiff resistance which gave rise to the story of Catherine Ségurane. Afterwards, Francis allowed the Ottomans to winter at Toulon. The strategic and sometimes tactical alliance lasted for about three centuries,Merriman, p. 132 until the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt, an Ottoman territory, in 1798–1801. French diplomacy with Persia (16th-19th centuries) The advent of Shah Ismail I in 1501 coincided with crucial world events. Becoming the eventual archrival of the Ottomans, the shah sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a precarious alliance against the Ottomans together with the Portuguese, Emperor Charles V, and King Ludvig II of Hungary. Whereas other European governments repeatedly insisted on their avowed desire to cooperate with Persia against the Turks, France remained aloof due to the treaty of 1536 between Francis I and Suleiman the Magnificent. When Suleiman I invaded north-west Persia and took Tabriz during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555), he was accompanied by the French ambassador Gabriel de Luetz, whose advice enabled the Ottomans to force the Persians to surrender the citadel of Van. When the tide turned in 1604 as Persia gained the upper hand against Ottonan Turkey, the French ambassador to the Porte, Savary de Brèves, wrote a memoir on how an alliance with Persian would be detrimental to Franco–Ottoman relations. Thus, the Turkish alliance prevented Henri IV from responding to the overtures made to him by shah Abbas I, who was rapidly reconquering lost territories and conquering beyond that in Anatolia and the Caucasus. French endeavors in the Near East remained cautious and limited even after the fall of the Safavids. However, France played an important part in post-Safavid external policies through Marquis de Bonnac, ambassador to the Porte, and who was an active mediator between Russia, Iran, and Turkey, all regional rivals. Cultural links between France and Persia, although gradually developing through this period, suffered at times because of ruptures in diplomatic commercial relations. However, relations picked up intensely with the advent of Napoleon and the Qajar dynasty in Persia. =Franco-Persian alliance (19th century)= The Persian Envoy Mirza Mohammed Reza-Qazvini meeting with Napoleon I at the Finckenstein Palace, 27 Avril 1807, for the signature of the Treaty of Finckenstein, a Franco-Persian alliance Despite the hostility of Russian Empress Catherine the Great towards both neighbouring rival Persia and the French Revolution, the ascendancy of the new monarchy in Persia represented by the Qajar dynasty did not at once led to closer relations between the two, except for the scientific mission of the physicians Jean-Guillaume Bruguières and Guillaume-Antoine Olivier. However, things changed in 1804 when Fath-Ali Shah Qajar asked Napoleon to help him recover Georgia, which had been ruled by Persia for centuries and was part of its integral domains, but had been invaded and annexed by Imperial Russia. Napoleon thought that closer ties with Persia might facilitate the defeat of Russia and open the way to India as well. Gardane, with colleagues Jaubert and Joanin, at the Persian court of Fath Ali Shah in 1808 Following his victory at Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon managed to establish the short- lived Franco-Ottoman alliance and a Franco-Persian alliance formalized in the Treaty of Finckenstein in 1807, while Persia and Russia were already for three years in the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), in order to obtain strategic support in his fight against the Russian Empire. The treaty included French support for Persia to reclaim its lost territories comprising Georgia and other territories in the Caucasus that were occupied by Russia by that time, promising to act so that Russia would surrender the territory. In exchange, Persia was to fight Great Britain, and allow France to cross the Persian territory to eventually reach India. \\"The Islamic World in decline\\" by Martin Sicker p. 97 Changes in the political atmosphere that marked the peace between France and Russia at the Treaty of Tilsit made the alliance lose its motivation. The ongoing Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) despite several successes partly influenced due to initial French assistance, resulted eventually in combination with the Treaty of Tilsit in a disaster for Persia, as not only was it forced to recognize Russian suzerainty over Georgia, its own land which it had been ruling for centuries, but it also facilitated the cession of Dagestan and most of what is today Azerbaijan to Russia amongst the other terms of the Treaty of Gulistan.John F. Baddeley. \\"The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus\\". Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90 French plans in Egypt Napoleon attempted to establish a decisive French presence in Asia, by first launching his Egyptian Campaign in 1798. He wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, and was then planning to make a junction with Tippu Sahib in India, against the British. Tricolor and crescent William E. Watson pp. 13-14 Napoleon assured the Directoire that \\"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions.\\" Napoleon and Persia by Iradj Amini, p. 12 According to a 13 February 1798 report by Talleyrand: \\"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from Suez to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English.\\" The Directory, though troubled by the scope and cost of the enterprise, agreed so the popular general would be absent from the centre of power.Schom 1998, pp. 72–73 Commercial, religious and military expansion (16th-18th century)=Early-modern contacts with East-Asia (1527-) Sailing ship near Java la Grande in Vallard Atlas 1547, Dieppe school Example of Dieppe maps, by Guillaume Brouscon, 1543 France began trading with Eastern Asia from the early 16th century. In 1526, a sailor from Honfleur named Pierre Caunay sailed to Sumatra. He lost his ship on the return leg between Africa and Madagascar, where the crew was imprisoned by the Portuguese.Orientalism in early Modern France 2008 Ina Baghdiantz McAbe, p. 78, In July 1527, a French Norman trading ship from Rouen is recorded by the Portuguese João de Barros to have arrived in the Indian city of Diu. The next year, a ship under Jean de Breuilly also arrived in Diu, but this time was seized by the Portuguese. In 1529, Jean Parmentier, sailing with the Sacre and the Pensée, reached Sumatra. European travellers in India Edward Farley Oaten p. 123 Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the Dieppe maps, influencing the work of Dieppe cartographers, such as Jean Rotz. Explorers and colonies: America, 1500-1625 David B. Quinn p. 57 Following the Portuguese and Spanish forays into Asia after 1500, a few Frenchmen participated in the activities of Catholic religious orders in these countries during the 16th century. The first instance of France-Thailand relations occurred according to the Jesuit Giovanni Pietro Maffei when about 1550 a French Franciscan, Bonferre, hearing of the great kingdom of the Peguans and the Siamese in the East, went on a Portuguese ship from Goa to Cosme (Pegu), where for three years he preached the Gospel, but without any result. The Catholic encyclopedia, p. 766 =François Pyrard and François Martin (1601-1611)= Itinerary of François Pyrard de Laval (1601—1611) In December 1600 a company was formed through the association of Saint-Malo, Laval and Vitré, to trade with the Moluccas and Japan. Two ships, the Croissant and the Corbin, were sent around the Cape in May 1601. One was wrecked in the Maldives, leading to the adventure of François Pyrard de Laval who managed to return to France in 1611. The second ship, carrying François Martin de Vitré, reached Ceylon and traded with Acheh in Sumatra, but was captured by the Dutch on the return leg at Cape Finisterre. François Martin de Vitré was the first Frenchman to write an account of travels to the Far East in 1604, at the request of Henry IV, and from that time numerous accounts on Asia were published. From 1604 to 1609, following the return of François Martin de Vitré, Henry IV developed a strong enthusiasm for commerce with Asia, and attempted to set up a French East India Company on the model of England and the Netherlands. On 1 June 1604, he issued letter patents to Dieppe merchants to form the Dieppe Company, giving them exclusive rights to Asian trade for 15 years, but no ships were actually sent. In 1606, Henri de Feynes left for China, which he became the first Frenchman to visit. On 1609, another adventurer, Pierre-Olivier Malherbe returned from a circumnavigation, and informed Henry IV of his adventures. He visited China, and in India had an encounter with Akbar. On the missionary front, Nicolas Trigault resumed France-China relations when he left Europe to do missionary work in Asia around 1610, eventually arriving at Nanjing, China in 1611. =Hasekura Tsunenaga (1615)= Hasekura Tsunenaga initiated France-Japan relations when he landed in Saint-Tropez in 1615. France-Japan relations started in 1615 when Hasekura Tsunenaga, a Japanese samurai and ambassador, sent to Rome by Date Masamune, landed at Saint-Tropez for a few days. In 1636, Guillaume Courtet, a French Dominican priest, would reciprocate when he set foot in Japan. He penetrated into Japan clandestinely, against the 1613 interdiction of Christianity. He was caught, tortured, and died in Nagasaki on 29 September 1637.Butler's Lives of the Saints by Alban Butler, Paul Burns, p. 259 =Company of the Moluccas (1615)= In 1615, the regent Marie de Médicis incorporated the merchants of Dieppe and other harbours to found the Company of the Moluccas. In 1616, two expeditions were Asia–bound from Honfleur in Normandy: three ships left for India, and two ships for Bantam. One ship returned from Bantam in 1617 with a small cargo, and letters from the Dutch expressing their hostility towards French ships in the East Indies. Also in 1616, two ships were sent from Saint-Malo to Java. One was captured by the Dutch, but the other obtained an agreement from the ruler of Pondicherry to build a fortress and a factory there, and returned with a rich cargo. \\"Fleet of Montmorency\\", led by Augustin de Beaulieu, in the East Indies (1619—1622) In 1619, an armed expedition composed of three ships (275 crew, 106 cannons) called the \\"Fleet of Montmorency\\" under General Augustin de Beaulieu was sent from Honfleur, to fight the Dutch in the Far East. They encountered the Dutch fleet off Sumatra. One ship was captured, another remained in Asia for inter- country trade, and the third returned to Le Havre in 1622. In 1624, with the Treaty of Compiègne, Richelieu obtained that the Dutch would stop fighting the French in the East. Isaac de Razilly commented however: Jean de Thévenot, from \\"Relation d'un voyage fait au Levant\\" (1664) However, trade further developed, with the activities of people such as Jean de Thévenot and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in 17th century Asia. Gilles de Régimont travelled to Persia and India in 1630 and returned in 1632 with a rich cargo. He formed a trading company at Dieppe in 1633, and sent ships every year to the Indian Ocean. Shipwrecks of Madagascar Pierre Van Den Boogaerde p. 115 In 1638, the Honfleur sailor Pierre Berthelot, after becoming a Carmelite in Goa in the mission of Francis Xavier, was martyred in Aceh.Divine aporia: postmodern conversations about the other by John Charles Hawley p. 205 Expansion under Louis XIV France adopted a more structured approach to its expansion in Asia during the 17th century during the rule of Louis XIV, in an organized attempt to establish a mercantile empire by taking a share of the lucrative market of the Indian Ocean.Colbert, Mercantilism, and the French Quest for Asian Trade by Ames, Glenn J. Northern Illinois University Press On the religious plane, the Paris Foreign Missions Society was formed from 1658 in order to provide for missionary work in Asia mainly, under French control. Soon after, the French East India Company was established in 1664. Chevalier de Chaumont presents a letter from Louis XIV to King Narai in 1685. In 1664 a mission was sent to Madagascar under François Caron, formerly in the service of the Dutch East India Company. The Madagascar mission failed, but soon after, Caron succeeded in founding French outposts at Surat (1668) and at Masulipatam (1669) in India;.Pope, George Uglow. (1880). A Text-book of Indian History, p. 266 Caron became \\"Commissaire\\" at Pondicherry (1668—1672). The French East India Company set up a trading centre at Pondicherry in 1673. This outpost eventually became the chief French settlement in India. In 1672, Caron helped lead French forces in Ceylon, where the strategic bay at Trincomalee was captured and St. Thomé (also known as Meilâpûr) on the Coromandel coast was also taken. However, his military success was short-lived. The French were driven out while Caron was en route to Europe in 1673.Frazer, Robert Watson. (1896). British India, p. 42 D'Anville's map of China and Central Asia (1734), compiled on the basis of the first systematic geographic survey of the entire Chinese Empire by a team of French Jesuits (c. 1700) During the reign of Louis XIV, France further developed France–Thailand relations and sent numerous embassies to Siam, led by Chevalier de Chaumont in 1685 and later by Simon de la Loubère in 1687, until French troops were ousted from the country following the 1688 Siege of Bangkok. Around the same time France actively participated in the Jesuit China missions, as Louis XIV sent in 1685 a mission of five Jesuits \\"mathematicians\\" to China in an attempt to break the Portuguese predominance: Jean de Fontaney (1643–1710), Joachim Bouvet (1656–1730), Jean-François Gerbillon (1654–1707), Louis Le Comte (1655–1728) and Claude de Visdelou (1656–1737).Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China - p. 182 by Catherine Pagani (2001) While French Jesuits were found at the court of the Manchu Kangxi Emperor in China, Louis received the visit of a Chinese Jesuit, Michael Shen Fu-Tsung, by 1684.The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art p. 98 by Michael Sullivan (1989) Furthermore, several years later, he had at his court a Chinese librarian and translator — Arcadio Huang.Barnes, Linda L.

Morret engraving (1789) After these first experiences, France took a more active role in Asia from its base in India. France was able to establish the beginnings of a commercial and territorial empire in India, leading to the formation of French India. Active Franco- Indian alliances were established to reinforce French influence and counter British efforts on the country. Suffren had a considerable role in upholding French naval power in the Indian Ocean. Burma–France relations started in 1727 with approaches by Joseph François Dupleix, and were cemented in 1729 with the building of a shipyard in the city of Syriam. France allied with the Mon people and participated in the Burman-Mon conflict in 1751–1756 under Sieur de Bruno and Pierre de Milard.Europe and Burma: A Study of European Relations with Burma- p. 62 by Daniel George Edward Hall - 1945: \\"Dupleix promised them men and munitions, but before deciding how far to commit himself he sent over his agent, the Sieur de Bruno, to Pegu\\".Findlay, Ronald and O'Rourke, Kevin H. (2007) Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium The geographical exploration of Asia was expanded thanks to the efforts of Bougainville and La Pérouse. Following the development of France- Vietnam relations through early trade and religious contacts, France intervened militarily in Vietnam at the end of the 18th century through the French assistance to Nguyễn Ánh under Mgr Pigneau de Behaine. France thus managed to gain strong positions in South Asia and Southeastern Asia, but these efforts were essentially wrecked with the outcome of the French revolution and Napoleonic wars. Trade also developed, with the activities of people such as Pierre Poivre who dealt with Vietnam from the 1720s. Asia in 17th-18th-century French art Madame de Pompadour portrayed as a Turkish lady by Charles André van Loo (1747) The discovery of Asia led to a strong cultural interest in Asian arts. France especially developed a taste for artistic forms derived from Chinese art and narratives, called Chinoiserie, as well as for Turkish scenes, called Turquerie. French textile industry was also strongly influenced by Asian style, with the development of the silk and tapestry industries. A carpet industry façon de Turquie (\\"in the manner of Turkey\\") was developed in France in the reign of Henry IV by Pierre Dupont, who was returning from the Levant, and especially rose to prominence during the reign of Louis XIV.Paris as it was and as it is, or, A sketch of the French capital by Francis William Blagdon p. 512 The Tapis de Savonnerie especially exemplify this tradition (\\"the superb carpets of the Savonnerie, which long rivalled the carpets of Turkey, and latterly have far surpassed them\\")The Industry of Nations London Exhibition of 1851 , which was further adapted to local taste and developed with the Gobelins carpets. This tradition also spread to Great Britain where it revived the British carpet industry in the 18th century.Sloan's Architecture - The Late Georgian Period by Samuel Sloan p. 114 Napoleon's Asian ventures Jean-François Allard became a General in the army of Ranjit Singh. For a brief period (1806—1815), France had an intense role in Indonesia, since the Netherlands became a province of France. The islands of Java and Bali were thus in contact with a Franco-Dutch administration.Hanna, p. 44 Napoleon handpicked a new Governor-General, the \\"Iron Marshall\\" Willem Daendels, sent ships and troops to reinforce the East Indies against British attacks, and had military fortifications built through the length of Java.Hanna, p. 45 A treaty of alliance was signed in 1808 between the new administration and the Balinese king of Badung, to provide workers and soldiers for the Franco-Dutch defensive effort, but Java fell to the British in 1811, and the agreement was not implemented.Hanna, pp. 45-47 After the Napoleonic era, some former soldiers of Napoleon left France as mercenaries in Asian countries. One of them Jean-François Allard, became the leader of the European officer corps in the Punjab, in the Maharaja Ranjit Singh's service. Sikh art and literature by Kerry Brown p. 43 Another mercenary of Ranjit Singh, Claude Auguste Court was an early student of Kushan coinage, whose coin–rubbings books are on display at the British Museum. Colonial era Through its defeat in the Napoleonic wars, France lost most of its colonial possessions, but the 19th century brought an era of Industrial revolution combined with European expansionism that saw France expand anew to form a second colonial empire in Asia. French Indochina French soldiers in the Tonkin (c. 1890) In the 1820s, France tried to reestablish contacts with Vietnam. On 12 January 1825, an embassy led by Captain Hyacinthe de Bougainville attempted to obtain a meeting with emperor Minh Mạng but failed. Instead, Christian missionaries were smuggled onshore in the person of Father Regéreau of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. These actions triggered edicts of persecution against Christianity by Minh Mạng. The Vietnamese Response to French Intervention, 1862—1874 p. 27 Using these persecutions as a pretext, in 1843, the French Foreign Minister, François Guizot, sent a fleet to the East under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Cécille and Captain Charner, together with the diplomat Lagrene.Chapuis, The Last Emperors, p. 4 The move responded to the successes of the British in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.Tucker, p. 27 New religious persecutions again triggered the Cochinchina Campaign (1858–1862) which marked the real beginning of territorial expansion in Vietnam. Expansion of French Indochina over Siam Northern Vietnam was then disputed with China, leading to the Tonkin campaign (1883–1886), and to French victory in the Sino-French War (1884–1885). France also expanded westward from its Vietnamese basis to dispute territory with Siam, leading to the Franco-Siamese War in 1893. French Indochina was formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia and Laos was added after the Franco- Siamese War. China campaigns France intervened several times in China, together with other Western powers, to expand Western influence there. France participated actively to the Second Opium War in 1860, also using religious persecutions as a pretext. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion led to massive French and Western intervention. Korea France also had an interventionist role in northeastern Asia throughout the second half of the 19th century. In Korea, religious persecutions again motivated the French Campaign against Korea in 1866. Although there were no territorial gains, these events would progressively lead to the opening of the \\"Hermit kingdom\\" to the rest of the world. Japan French military advisers and their Japanese allies in Hokkaido in 1868 In Japan, France had a key role in fighting anti-foreign forces and supporting the Late Tokugawa shogunate. In 1863–64, France battled anti-forces at the Bombardment of Shimonoseki. In 1867, a French military mission to Japan was sent by Napoleon III to support the shōgun.French policy in Japan during the closing years of the Tokugawa regime by Meron Medzini p. 125 French soldiers such as Jules Brunet even fought on the side of the shōgun against pro-Imperial forces during the Boshin war. Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec lithograph poster of 1892, an example of Japonism Although the shōgun was defeated in the Boshin war, France continued to take an active role in supporting Japan military through the 1872–1880 mission, the 1884–89 mission, the 1918–19 mission, and had a key role in the development of the Imperial Japanese Navy with the mission of Emile Bertin. Naval warfare, 1815–1914 Lawrence Sondhaus p. 150 Asia in 19th-century French art Asia influenced Western authors, and especially French ones, in an artistic school known as Orientalism. Asian scenes were typically depicted in an idealistic and voluptuous manner. Impressionism also was strongly influenced by the vividness of Japanese painting through Japonism. French literature was also strongly influenced by Asia, as in the works of Pierre Loti. Decolonization and modern collaboration A French Foreign Legion unit patrols in a Communist- controlled area during the Indochina War. The 20th century was marked by the French difficulties during World War II, and the general decolonization that followed. In particular, the Indochina War (1946–1954) marked the end of French military presence in southeast Asia. The Vietnam War Mitchell K. Hall p. 6 Since then, contacts have resumed, and France has remained a strong economic partner to Asian countries. French exports include nuclear power technologies, advanced transportation technologies such as Airbus or TGV, food products, and consumer industries. Asia in turn finds in France a receptive market for its manufactured goods.

Just prior to this, the king's ambassador Muhammad Beg Shámalí had come to Tattá and appointed Áká Muhammad Sálih as the agent in charge of the Tattá. He takes some nobles of the place had started for the royal camp. Sálih Khán's men would not allow Áká Muhammad Sálih to carry on the State duties. When Muhammad Beg Shámlú who, on receiving orders to that effect, had sent back the nobles, arrived at the camp, he was blamed for not making a good selection for the collection of revenue at Tattá. A fresh order was therefore issued appointing Kází Muhammad Mahfúz to the post. Again the nobles were required to pay respects to the king at his camp, to their chagrin. Appointed to be Ruler (Nawáb Sarbuland Khan) While the Kázi's oldest child was contending with Sálih Khán concerning who should gather the income and other government duty, data was circulated that the lord had named Muhammad Muradyáb Khán to be the leader of Sind with the title of \\"Nawáb Sarbuland Khán.\\" It would give the idea that, at this time, the late Mian's agent Díwán Gidúmal had been grinding away in the court of the ruler and had at long last prevailing with regards to securing the ruler's generosity, as the boss and nobles had paid faithfulness to the lord and Muhammad Atur Khan had been surrendered as a prisoner. So the nobles went specifically to Umarkót to meet their new ruler, who on getting the respect now walked to his capital. Sheik Zafarulláh was named to be the director of Tata, and yet, again there was peace and request at that place. The reception of the Mián at Nasarpúr. Díwán Gidúmal had joined Muhammad Murádyáb Khán in the vicinity of Umarkót and had given him the order of rulership and the robe of honor, which he had brought from the king. The plain near Nasarpúr was adorned with tents and flags to be the first camp of the new ruler on his return to his country. The Mián encamped at the place and spent several days there, founding a new town at the location, calling it Murádábád after his name. Battle of Manupur In 1748, Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded Indus River Valley prompting Muradyab Khan Kalhoro the Subedar of Sindh to dispatch reinforcements to assist the Mughal Army along the river banks. Prince Ahmad and the respected Grand Vizier Asaf Jah I was sent by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah to command a significant Mughal Army of 75,000 to confront the advancing Durranis. At Sirhind, both forces fought a decisive battle and Prince Ahmad was nominally victorious. The Mián marches against the Jám of Kakrálah and his defeat. Near the close of the year, he determined to settle the affair of the Jám of Kakrálah. He marched against him and prevailed after several battles. The Jám was removed from Kódáriah and confined at Kakrálah, his headquarters. The land of Óchtah, Lanjárf, Mirán, and Kachah was taken into his possession by the Mián, who fixed upon the last named place to be the chief centre of stores and strengthened each of the above areas with a fort. The Mián’s rupture with his nobles, who conspire against him. For the next two years the Mián ruled the country quietly and satisfactorily, but in the fourth year of his reign, symptoms of misrule and confusion began to appear, as he altogether changed his behaviour and commenced ill-treating the Siraí chiefs and oppressing his subjects. Having been much annoyed and hard pressed owing to the financial demands of the king, Mián Muhammad Múrad determined to retire after sweeping his country clean of whatever he could lay his hands upon. With that object in view, he had already commenced sending up his treasures to the port of Muscat. About the close of the year, he thought of starting from his capital and while passing through the territory of the Jám of Kakrálah, of laying waste to it and plundering it. He, therefore, proposed to send a large army to that state. The Siraí chiefs, who on the occasion of the last treaty had sworn on the Korán not to make any breach of the terms, opposed him and refused to join him in the undertaking. They withdrew and, combining, promised to espouse the cause of Mián Ghulám Sháh and to put him on the throne. Muhammad Murád dethroned and the election of Mián Ghulám Sháh. Mustering strength among themselves on the night preceding 13th Zí-Hajj, 1170 A.H. (1757 A. D.) the Sirái nobles besieged the Mián's residence and took him and his favorite chiefs, prisoners. The next morning his brother Mián Ghulám Sháh was placed on the throne. He tried his best to please the nobility as well as the common people, who had been oppressed by Muhammad Murád. The town of Alahábád founded, and the revolt of Muhammad Murád’s brother Ahmadyár Khán. Soon after the Áshúrah (the 10th of Muharram) of the new year, that accursed town was surrounded by the floods of the river, so that Mián Ghulám Sháh deserted it and built another city near his father's Muhammadábád and called it Alahábád. All the chiefs and nobles recognized him as their ruler and paid homage to him, except Ahmadyár Khán, brother by the same mother to Muhammad Murádyáb, who was then at Khudábád, and Maksúdah Fakír, son of Bahár Sháh, who at first left his father's side with the intention of adhering to Mián Ghulám Sháh's cause, and subsequently came and entered the Mián's service, apparently to avoid unpleasant results. The Mián’s other brother Atur Khán appointed as ruler by the royal decree. Meanwhile, Atur Khán, who was a hostage with the king, represented his case in person very strongly and succeeded in having the order of rulership passed in his own name. Hearing this, Ahmadyár Khán began collecting forces. The Siraí chiefs now repented of what they had done and knowing that Atur Khán had been duly appointed as a ruler by royal decree, thought it prudent to submit to him. Mián Ghulám Sháh, therefore, had no other alternative but to move with his whole army to the sandy desert on 25th of Saffar of the same year. After he had traveled a few stages, Maksúdah Fakír having received letters from Atur Khán to that effect, set Muhammad Murádyáb at liberty, and deserting Miáu Ghulám Sháh's cause, and taking some Siraí chiefs with him started to meet the newly appointed ruler, while Mián Ghulám Sháh with Rájah Líkhí, a few other friendly chiefs and a selected band of soldiers hastened away to a distance.

The French Fourth Army offensive against the German 4th Army was to support the (GAN, Northern Army Group) along the Chemin des Dames, in the Second Battle of the Aisne. General Anthoine, commander of the Fourth Army planned a supporting attack but this was rejected by Nivelle and Anthoine planned a frontal attack by two corps on an front, to break through the German defences on the first day and commence exploitation the following day. The battle took place east of Reims, between Prunay and Aubérive, in the province of Champagne, along the Moronvilliers Hills. On the left of XII Corps to the east of the Suippes, the 24th Division established a flank guard by attacking through Bois des Abattis towards Germains and Baden- Baden trenches. On the left flank of the division, Aubérive east of the river was rapidly captured. On the west bank of the Suippes, the 75th Territorial Regiment (Moroccan Division) made progress round the main part of Aubérive. The Moroccan Division was repulsed on its extreme right but the (March Regiment of the Foreign Legion) gained a foothold at Le Golfe. North-east of Mont Haut, the advance reached a depth of and next day the advance was pressed further. To the west, the French 34th Division took Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond and the 16th Division was repulsed at Bois de la Grille. The French spent 18 April consolidating and the 45th Division pushed up to the southern edge of Mont Haut. The \\"Monts\\" were held against a German counter-attack on 19 April, between Nauroy and Moronvilliers, by the 5th Division and 6th Division, which had been trained as (specialist counter-attack divisions), supported by the 23rd Division plus one regiment. Next day, the French 33rd Division captured Le Téton and the capture of Aubérive was completed by the 24th Division and the Territorial battalions. On 20 April, French troops got onto the summit of Le Casque and on 22 April, the eastern and lower summit of Mont Haut was secured by the 45th Division. The Fourth Army took and Counter- attacks by the German 4th Army on 27 May had temporary success, before the French recaptured ground around Mont Haut; lack of troops had forced the Germans into piecemeal attacks, instead of a simultaneous attack all along the front. The French attacked again from and despite German counter-attacks on 19 and 23 April, advanced slightly on the Heights of Moronvilliers. After a lull, the French attacked again on 30 April and ended the offensive on 20 May. The number of German prisoners taken by the end of the battle had been increased to and Background=Strategic developments The Moronvilliers massif was a group of hills, densely wooded before 1914, to the west of the Suippes river. The village of Moronvilliers lay in a dip below the north crest of the main ridge. There is an outlying peak known as Mont Sans Nom, high, with a hollow then a ridge to the north-west, the highest part of which is the western summit of Mont Haut at . West of the ridge, which in 1917 was between the left flank of the French Fourth Army and the Fifth Army, was an area of low ground about wide, between the Moronvilliers massif and the Nogent l'Abbesse massif east of Reims, in which lay the village of Beine. A road ran east from Beine to Nauroy, Moronvilliers and St Martin l'Heureux on the Suippes, north of the Moronvilliers massif. The eastern slope declines close to the bank of the Suippes, between St Martin-l'Heureux and Aubérive and the southern slope declines south of the road from Reims to St Hilaire le Grand, St Ménéhould and Verdun as it descends into the Plain of Châlons. The highest point of Mont Haut is nearly as high as Vigie de Berru (, the highest hill overlooking Reims from the east. The capture of Mont Sans Nom and the Moronvilliers Ridge would threaten the German hold on the Beine basin and the Nogent l'Abbesse massif; the loss of these would make the German positions on the Fresne and Brimont heights untenable. The loss of Fort Brimont would make the German positions on the low ground south of the Aisne, from Berméricourt north-west to the mouth of the Suippes, vulnerable to another attack. The capture of the German defences on the edge of the Châlons Plain above Aubérive, was necessary for an advance around Beine and an attack from the east of the Nogent l'Abbesse massif. Success would allow the Fourth Army to advance towards the Suippes, between St Martin l'Heureux and Warmeriville to the north-west, outflank the Nogent l'Abbesse hills from the north. The railway from Bazancourt to Warmeriville, Somme-Py and Apremont, the main German supply line south of the Aisne, would be cut. New railways had been built by the Germans but cutting the line would make it difficult for the Germans to supply the forces east of the Suippes and west of the upper Aisne. Should Mont Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut, Mont Perthois, Le Casque, Le Téton and Mont Sans Nom be captured, the German defences from the Suippes to the Argonne would be outflanked from the west. The German positions on the hills overlooked the Plain of Châlons, giving an uninterrupted view of French movements between Reims and the Argonne. A successful French offensive would deprive the Germans of observation and block the route to the Plain of Châlons. Tactical developments On the right flank, the XII Corps contributed the 24th Division to the attack and the XVII Corps (General J. B. Dumas) west of the Suippes, had three divisions and some additional troops. On the left of the Fourth Army, the VIII Corps (General Hely d'Oissel) had two divisions and one regiment. Relatively few French infantry were to attack but were supported by a huge amount of artillery, which had been discreetly moved into the area and camouflaged. More lines had been added to the railways behind the French front, extensions and a network of light railways had been built in the Moronvilliers sector and roads had been repaired and enlarged for motor vehicles, behind the Fourth Army front. French preparations could not be disguised from the German observers on the hills above the Châlons Plain but as similar activity was occurring at many places, from the North Sea to Switzerland, it was not until the arrival of large number of guns had been detected by the Germans, that the possibility of a French offensive became known. Even knowledge of the arrival of more guns was not conclusive, because the quantity of guns and munitions held by the Allies had become so enormous, that even the presence of a thousand guns and the expenditure of millions of shells could be a feint. Prelude=French offensive preparations The French Fourth Army comprised the XII, XVII, VIII corps and tank (Captain H. Lefebvre), with two Schneider CA1 groups, 1 (AS 1) and AS 10 of eight tanks each, reinforced by some Saint-Chamond tanks. The on the Fourth Army front had 22 (squadrons) of aircraft and eleven balloon companies, the artillery had The Fourth Army held an front, just north of the Reims, St Hilaire le Grand, St Ménéhould to Verdun road, between Massiges and , about below the peak of Mont Haut. To reach the summit, the French infantry would have to advance about up a series of steep rises. The French bombardment opened on 10 April, against the German first, second and third lines on the south side of the ridge. The German defences on the northern slope, were bombarded under the direction of French artillery-observation aircraft observers. Villages, woods, roads, railway lines, cantonments, bivouacs, artillery batteries and ammunition dumps were \\"deluged\\" by shellfire, with few pauses until dawn on 17 April. Poor weather interfered with air-observation but by the night of 16 April, reconnaissance photographs taken from the air, reports from ground observers and prisoner reports, showed that wide lanes had been cut through the barbed wire entanglements in front of the German first line, where they had not been obliterated and that German trench lines and field fortifications, particularly south of Mont Sans Nom had been destroyed. Few German defences remained intact, except for those in Bois de la Grille and around Aubérive. The second line, half-way up the slopes of the Moronvilliers hills, was destroyed from south of Mont Perthois to the Suippes, barbed-wire in the woods to the north-east of Mont Sans Nom was partially cut, making an attack on the German position on the ridges above the Suippes practicable. In the west, from Bois de la Grille to Tranchée du Bois du Chien, the bombardment was less effective and the German defences in Bois de la Grille and Trench behind it and Erfurt Trench to the east, were not destroyed. South of Mont Haut, the and the row of dugouts up the south slope of Mont Perthois, had not been seriously damaged. Most of the German defences on the southern slopes of Mont Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut and Mont Perthois had been badly damaged but many intermediate strong points, machine-gun nests remained. Most of the German observation posts on Mont Cornillet, Mont Haut and Le Téton, had been destroyed but many dugouts and buried telephone lines had remained intact, as did the German defences on the north slopes of the Mont Cornillet–Le Téton ridge and the tunnels under Mont Cornillet and Mont Perthois, which were still unknown to the French. German infantry encampments, below the ridge on the north slope had been damaged and the roads from Nauroy, Mont Haut and Moronvilliers, to St Masmes, Pont Faverger, Betheniville and the Suippes valley north-west of St Hilaire-le-Petit, were blocked in places by shell craters. An attack from the west, was still obstructed by Bois de la Grille and Trench and an attack on the eastern flank would be confronted by Le Golfe, a position which extended the German line east to Aubérive. The fortified village of Vaudesincourt to the north, on the banks of the Suippes and the maze of trenches on the right bank, had been badly damaged but much of the wire was uncut and blockhouses and pill-boxes had not been destroyed. French plan of attack The Fourth Army plan was to capture Bois de la Grille, Leopoldshöhe Trench and all of the south face of the Moronvilliers hills, push the Germans back from Le Golfe and encircle Aubérive from the flanks. Vaudesincourt was then to be captured and the right flank was to link with the centre, which was to take Côte 181 and Mont Sans Nom. If Le Téton had not been captured, the troops in the French centre, were to drive the Germans from Bois de Côte 144 and attack the hill from the east. East of the Suippes, on the right flank of the XVII Corps, four and a half battalions were to attack Aubérive and the trenches beyond, up to those at the western fringe of Bois des Abatis. West of the Suippes to the south of Aubérive, the Moroccan Division, a regiment of the Foreign Legion and the 185th Territorial Brigade were to take Aubérive, the German blockhouses at Vaudesincourt, Le Golfe and Mont Sans Nom. On the right flank of the XVII Corps, one division was to capture Le Casque, its wood and Le Téton; on the left flank the divisional objectives were the summits of Mont Haut, Mont Perthois and the trenches linking Mont Haut to Le Casque. The VIII Corps (General Hely d'Oissel), was to capture Mont Cornillot and Mont Blond, Flensburg Trench and the next one behind, which connected the defences of the summits, Mont Blond, Mont Cornillot, Bois de la Grille and Trench. German defensive preparations The high ground from Mont Cornillet to the west, ran north-east to the height of Mont Blond, on to Mont Haut and then descended by Le Casque to Le Téton. Just in front of Mont Haut was Mont Perthois, at about the same height as Mont Cornillet. An attack from the south on Mont Blond and Mont Haut, could be subjected to enfilade fire by the Germans on Mont Cornillet and Mont Perthois. Mont Sans Nom lay about to the south-east of Le Téton, at the same height as Mont Blond, with Côte 181 at the south end. The two defensive lines built before the (Second Battle of Champagne, September–November 1915), had been increased to four and in places to five lines, which enclosed defensive zones by early 1917. The number of communication trenches in the defensive zones had been increased, trenches and dugouts deepened and huge amounts of concrete used, to reinforce the fortifications against French artillery-fire. Two tunnels, capable of accommodating several battalions of infantry, had been dug under the north slope of Mont Cornillet and the north-east side of Mont Perthois. The Cornillet Tunnel had three galleries, with light railways along two of the galleries, a transverse connecting tunnel and air shafts up to the top of the hill. The tunnel under Mont Perthois was less elaborate but had many machine-gun posts and exits, from which a French attack on Le Casque and Le Téton, could be engaged and used as a jumping-off points for counter- attacks. The German defences between the Suippes and the Vesle, lay on a plateau overlooked by Mont Berru high and along Moronvilliers Ridge, which was about long and about high. The ridge dominated the plain of Châlons and there was a parallel, lower ridge about high, which met the main ridge at the village of Beine; the two ridges declined steeply to the south. The German defence was based on zones deep; the first position lay at the foot of the forward slope with three trench lines K1, K2 and K3; the (Intermediate Position, also ) had been built on the reverse slopes connected by tunnels. The third position was on the north slope of the second ridge and the fourth position lay along the foot of the reverse slope. A fifth reserve position, the lay further back. The 3rd Army positions were divided into five sectors, from Béthény to Prosnes, Prosnes to Sainte-Marie-à-Py, Sainte-Marie-à-Py to Tahure, Tahure to Rouvroy and Rouvroy to Argonne, with including divisions and fresh units, which had been transferred from other parts of the Western Front. German possession of Mont Perthois and Mont Sans Nom meant that a French attack on Le Casque and Le Téton could be engaged by crossfire. The hills on the edge of the Châlons plain could be outflanked from west to east, only after the German defences on either side of the Thuizy–Nauroy road and between Mont Sans Nom and the Suippes had been captured. The main German defensive position was in the ruins of Bois de la Grille to the south-west of Mont Cornillet and west of the Thuizy–Nauroy road. An attack from the east on the hills was blocked by the entrenchments from Mont Sans Nom to the Suippes, which ran south-east around Aubérive-sur-Suippes on the left bank of the river. North of Aubérive on the left bank was the fortified village of Vaudesincourt on the St Martin-l'Heureux road. The Germans had dug several lines of trenches from north to south, on the west and east slopes of the hills, the trenches on the west running north and west of Nauroy. In front of Nauroy was another trench, which linked the defences on top of Mont Cornillet. Near the Suippes, a network of trenches followed the ridge above the river to St Martin-l'Heureux. Higher up the slope, another trench led to Grand Bois de la Côte 179 and protected Le Téton from an attack from the north-east. An advance down the right bank of the Suippes, towards Dontrien and St Martin-l'Heureux and the Bazancourt to Somme-Py and Apremont railway, was obstructed by a trench system east of Aubérive and Bois de la Côte 152. The first German line in the south of this defensive zone, comprised several parallel trenches connected by communication trenches, with numerous dug-outs, concrete blockhouses and pill-boxes. A second line higher up the ridge, was joined to the first by the Trench, a fortified approach from the north of Bois de la Grille to the Thuizy–Nauroy road. The Leopoldshöhe Trench was continued to the east, below the summits of Mont Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut and Mont Perthois, by Erfurt Trench. South of Le Casque and Le Téton, it became , Trench and then Trench, to the positions on the east slope of the hills. The trench ran below and Côte 181 and Mont Sans Nom. Behind the German second line, the hilltops had been wired for all-round defence, connected by communication trenches. The crests of the hills had been fortified on the south and north sides; on the northern slope of Mont Cornillet and the north- east side of Mont Perthois, were the defensive tunnels. The tunnel entrances were invisible to air observation and a French advance across the top of Mont Cornillet could be attacked from behind from them. Every move by the French, was under observation from the German positions but the ridge from Mont Cornillet to Le Téton and the woods to the west and east, hid German movements from ground observation and could only be detected by French aviators, who were frequently grounded by bad weather in the winter and spring of 1916–1917. By the beginning of April, the German Higher Command expected a French offensive from the Ailette to Reims but the quiescence of the French artillery east of Reims, led to no serious operation against Nogent l'Abbesse or Moronvilliers being anticipated. During Easter, General Martin Chales de Beaulieu, the XIV Corps commander and the general commanding the 214th Division at Moronvilliers, briefed his subordinates that only artillery demonstrations were likely, between Reims and Aubérive. (Lieutenant-General) Georg von Gersdorf, the 58th Division commander, disagreed with Beaulieu and eventually resigned. The German defences were held by the 30th Division, 58th Division, 214th Division and 29th Division from east to west. The 29th and 58th divisions were considered to be of high quality but the 214th Division was new and its troops had had little opportunity for training; the 30th Division was considered to have one good and two indifferent regiments. The German infantry on the hills were organised with a battalion of each regiment in the front line, the second battalion half way back up the slopes and the third battalion in reserve on the southern and northern crests, protected in dugouts and tunnels. companies were posted further back to reinforce counter- attacks. On 10 April, the bombardment by the Fourth Army began, with such force that Beaulieu ordered the German garrisons to prepare for immediate attack and warned the reserve and (specialist counter-attack divisions), the 32nd Division from St Quentin, the 23rd Division from Sedan and the 5th Division and 6th Division in Alsace, to be ready to move to the Moronvilliers area; the 32nd Division began to move on 15 April. The German artillery was reinforced from batteries on 1 April, to With reinforcements, there were four divisions on the flanks and the Moronvilliers massif in between and four divisions in close reserve. The German infantry had many machine-guns and automatic rifles, mortars, flame-throwers and hand-grenades, supported by which had been registered on all likely targets. Battle=17 April Heavy rain fell and snowstorms continued throughout the night of It was still dark when the Fourth Army, on the left of (GAC, Central Army Group) attacked at from Aubérive east of Reims, with the XII, XVII and VIII corps, on an front. The infantry advanced behind a creeping barrage, in cold rain alternating with snow showers but the training of the French infantry and careful planning, meant that the unexpected darkness during the advance favoured the French, even though aeroplanes and observation balloons were grounded by high, gusting winds. In the XII Corps area on the right flank, the 24th Division, Moroccan Division and the 75th Territorial Regiment of XVII Corps, were to attack from the east bank of the Suippes to Aubérive and west from Aubérive to Mont Sans Nom, south-east of Le Téton. The 24th Division with battalions, attacked on a line from the salient at Bois des Abatis, west to the Suippes, north of Bois des Sapins. On the right flank, the French were only able to enter the German front trench and Baden-Baden Trench further to the north but surprised the German defenders nearer the river and advanced much further along the riverbank. German counter-attacks in the XII Corps area on 19, 20 and 22 April, recaptured some lost ground. On the right flank of the Moroccan Division, the (RMLE, March Regiment of the Foreign Legion) attacked at between Bois en T and Bois de la Sapinière towards Le Golfe, from where the RMLE was to turn east and seize the road from Aubérive to Vaudesincourt and Dontrien. The RMLE advanced through a downpour to Bouleaux Trench and then overran Le Golfe; early on 18 April, Byzance, Dardanelles and Prince Eitel trenches, to the south-west of Aubérive were captured. The attack achieved a measure of surprise but the German defence on the left flank, held up the French advance at Levant Trench and in Bois Allonge, which were eventually captured, before the advance resumed on Trench. To the west, the German counter-barrage was fired late and Mont Sans Nom was captured by More than six guns and several machine-guns were captured. In the XVII Corps area, the 33rd Division attacked with the 11th Regiment on the right towards Le Téton and the 20th Regiment against Le Casque. The 11th Regiment advance began at accompanied by a battery of light field guns. German machine-guns to the east, in the strong points and Bois en V, on the west slope of Mont Sans Nom, fired into the flank of the French attack and the rest of the day was spent capturing the German defences in these areas. The 20th Regiment captured redoubts around Bois du Chien, after fighting all day and then began preparing a dawn attack Le Casque. The 45th Division attacked Mont Blond, by advancing between the Prosnes–Nauroy track, Bois de la Mitrailleuse and Bois Marteau, to the south-east of Mont Perthois but was held up in the evening of 17 April, at the , which lay on the road from Prosnes, at the junction with the Nauroy–Moronvilliers road, midway between Mont Blond and Mont Haut. The capture of the was vital to the possession of Mont Blond and the final objectives along the twin summits of Mont Haut, the north-west trench of Le Casque and Mont Perthois to the south, between Mont Haut and Le Casque. The advance had begun while the German front-line infantry was still sheltering underground and the German artillery did not begin barrage-fire until The advance towards Bois-en-Escalier in the centre began well and several field- gun batteries stood by to follow the advance, after a short delay at the German first line in Bois-en-Escalier, where the Germans were outflanked from the north and killed or captured. Erfurt Trench was overrun and then the was attacked from the west. Later in the day, reserves from the 34th Division were sent forward and when part of Erfurt Trench fell, the was attacked from the east. Field artillery moved forward and engaged the from near Bois-en-Escalier but the reinforced concrete structure was so resilient, that the attack on the redoubt and dug-outs was postponed, until a bombardment by heavy howitzers could be arranged next day. The troops near the redoubt dug in but the troops on the right flank, advanced close to the summit of the ridge. At the French took the east end of Erfurt Trench, despite delays as some redoubts held out, reached the edge of Bois de Mont Perthois by noon and then repulsed four German counter-attacks before nightfall. In the VIII Corps area, the 34th Division east of the Thuizy–Nauroy road, attacked at with two regiments and an hour later, could be seen threading their way up the heights, bombing dug-outs and fighting hand-to-hand in the open with German infantry. By part of Erfurt Trench and the communication trenches leading towards it, had been captured but the Germans retained a foothold, at the west end of the trench. The 83rd Regiment resumed the advance on Mont Cornillet and the 59th Regiment attacked Mont Blond the 34th Division took nearly all of its objectives on Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, at the west end of the Moronvilliers massif. The troops on the left were exposed by the repulse of the troops to the west, beyond the Thuizy–Nauroy road. German resistance in the to the south-east of Mont Blond, prevented its right from being supported by the 45th division. The 83rd Regiment managed a costly advance to the summit of Mont Cornillet but German machine-guns on the ridge between Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, slowed the advance. The left flank of the 59th Regiment was stopped by the Germans at Flensburg Trench, which connected the German defences of Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, losing touch with the 83rd Regiment. The Germans in the west end of Erfurt Trench repulsed the attack and the left flank regiment of the 45th Division to the right, was held up at the . Lobit, the 34th division commander, sent the reserve battalions of the two regiments, to guard the open western flank of the division, between Erfurt trench and Mont Cornillet and to close the gap between the 83rd and 59th regiments. Some companies were sent to outflank the from the west. Field artillery from the 128th Division was galloped up the slopes of Mont Cornillet, despite German return fire and the 34th Division was subjected to a heavy German bombardment and counter-attacks against both flanks. At the German garrison and reinforcements from the tunnel under the hill, broke into the French position on Mont Cornillet. The 2nd Battalion of the 83rd Regiment, held on to the north end of the trench until when it ran out of ammunition and withdrew behind the crest, where the survivors repulsed a German attack at midnight. Counter-attacks against the 59th Regiment, from the neck between Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond and also from Mont Haut, were repulsed by small-arms fire and a bombing fight with hand-grenades. More German attacks were made at nightfall but French field and heavy artillery fire, repulsed the German infantry, except for a short time on the left flank. The 16th Division (General Le Gallais), attacked on the extreme left flank, west of the Thuizy–Nauroy road against Bois de la Grille and Trench. Having gained its objectives, the division was to face west and north, to guard the rear of the 34th Division to the east, as it attacked Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond. The objectives of the 16th Division were on a slight incline, which in the conditions of 1917, was more dangerous to the attacking force than a steep one, because of the lack of dead ground. The two regiments in the centre and on the right were stopped by the German machine-gun fire from Wahn Trench, which ran from the Thuizy–Nauroy road, through the south end of Bois de la Grille. West of the Thuizy–Nauroy road, the French artillery bombardment failed to destroy many of the German fortifications and some of the trees in Bois de la Grille were still standing. The main redoubt was intact and parts of Leopoldshöhe Trench were untouched. Despite the difficulties, the 95th Regiment, on the left flank, swiftly broke through the wood and entered Leopoldshöhe Trench. At the flanks of the 95th Regiment were counter-attacked and the French driven back from Leopoldshöhe Trench, into Bois de la Grille until noon, when the French survivors ran out of hand- grenades and withdrew to the shell-holes, along the trace of the German first position. During the afternoon and evening, companies on the left flank made some progress westwards. The centre and right regiments attacked again and took Trench but German counter-attacks prevented a further advance. 18 April At dawn on 18 April, the German counter-attack in the XII Corps area, reached Constantinople Trench, only for the infantry to be surrounded and taken prisoner. In the XVII Corps zone, the 45th Division attacked, after a \\"devastating\\" howitzer bombardment at on the and the dug-outs nearby and after thirty minutes, the garrisons surrendered. French troops took over the fortifications, which were then bombarded by German artillery. The French heavy artillery switched their fire for two hours onto Mont Haut and Mont Perthois. At the French attacked the two summits of Mont Haut and Fosse Froide Trench, which ran from Mont Haut, across the northern slopes of Mont Perthois. The highest point of the massif on the eastern summit of Mont Haut, was captured at The attack on Fosse Froide Trench was held up just short, which left the Germans with a foothold on Mont Haut. On 18 April, the 45th Division on the right, completed the capture of the and dug-outs nearby, the 34th Division consolidated and the 83rd Regiment was relieved by the 88th Regiment. The 11th Regiment of the 33rd Division, attacked again and was caught in cross-fire, from machine-guns at the mouth of the western entrances of the Mont Perthois tunnel. The French light field guns engaged the machine-guns and put them out of action, then fired at the entrances, while heavy artillery bombarded the slopes and tops of Le Casque and Le Téton, with high explosive shells; the 34th Division, on the right of VIII Corps, consolidated. 19 April The 33rd Division attacked the heights of Le Casque and Le Téton at The 11th Regiment advanced quickly up Le Téton in the dawn sun and the German defenders fought hand-to-hand on the narrow summit. Waves of German reinforcements climbed the northern slopes to dislodge the French. The 20th Regiment attacked Le Casque, under machine-gun fire from the woods, on the western slopes of Mont Perthois. The French veered to the right, away from the machine-gun fire and attacked Rendsburg and Göttingen trenches. German counter-attacks forced the 20th Regiment to halt below the summit and during lulls German artillery bombarded the summit from the west, north and south. French artillery replied with heavy bombardments on the peak and on Moronvilliers village, in the hollow beneath. Columns of the German 5th and 6th divisions in lorries and German artillery batteries, could be seen on the roads approaching the German front positions, from the Suippes at St Hilaire le Petit, Bethenville and Pont Faverger. At two German battalions attacked the summit, which was recaptured and lost twice. A French reserve battalion was committed and soon French units dissolved into a mass of individuals, who fought on their own initiative. During the night of German infantry infiltrated the woods on the flanks of the summit and at dawn, German artillery-observation aircraft directed the fire of German batteries, before another German counter-attack, which was repulsed. To relieve the pressure, the 20th Regiment of the 33rd Division resumed the attack on Le Casque; Rendsburg and Göttingen trenches were captured and the French entered the wood on the hill, before reaching the summit of Le Casque at and then being forced to retire by German counter-attacks. (On 20 April, the 11th Regiment was relieved but the rest of the 33rd Division remained until 1 May.) The 16th Division on the left of VIII Corps, consolidated during 18 April. At on another counter-attack was repulsed on the right of the VIII Corps area by the 34th Division. Later in the morning, the reserve battalions of the 34th Division captured part of the south end of the Düsseldorf communication trench and all of Offenburg Trench but were repulsed from Hönig Trench. Further up the hill, the French held a trench descending from the summit and the southern crest of Mont Cornillet, the east end of Flensburg Trench and the summit of Mont Blond. The French took two field guns, eight mortars and eighteen machine-guns. Aubérive redoubt fell at dawn, to attacks by the XII Corps divisions and at Aubérive was found abandoned and swiftly occupied by detachments of the 24th Division, which had crossed from the right bank of the Suippes and by Territorials of the 75th Regiment; the Germans had withdrawn to a redoubt south of Vaudesincourt. In the centre, Posnanie and Beyrouth trenches and the Labyrinth redoubt were still occupied by German troops, in front of the Main Boyau trench, the last defensive position running down from the Moronvilliers Hills to the Suippes south of Vaudesincourt. In the XVII Corps area, part of Fosse Froide Trench was captured by the 45th Division, which endangered the communications of the German garrison on Mont Perthois. German counter-attacks from Moronvilliers were dispersed by French artillery, directed over the heights from observation posts on Mont Haut and next day German columns, trying to reach the summits through ravines south-west of Moronvilliers, were also repulsed by French artillery-fire. The German 5th and 6th divisions from Alsace, were moved into the line between the south of Mont Blond and Le Téton and from there, recaptured the summit of Mont Haut. The difficulties of the VIII Corps divisions continued and the 16th Division was attacked by the German Infantry Regiment 145 which had just arrived, after an extensive artillery bombardment, to force the French 95th Regiment from the western fringe of the wood. The German attack was defeated by small-arms fire and another German counter-attack on 20 April, was repulsed but a resumption of the French advance was cancelled. German infantry massed in the woods between Monronvilliers and Nauroy, opposite the VIII Corps front and after a preliminary bombardment, attacked Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, from Waves of German troops ascended the northern slopes of the hills, joined the German infantry from the Mont Cornillet tunnel and Flensburg Trench and attacked the positions of the 34th Division. German reinforcements were assembled in echelon from Mont Haut westwards to Nauroy and attacked all day, until a final effort failed at 20 April In the XVII Corps area, the French captured Bois Noir. The 34th Division on the right of VIII Corps, failed to take a small wooded height on the left, south-east of Mont Cornillet and on the night of detachments of the 169th Division entered two trenches west of the Cornillet redoubt and reached an observation post, from where they were repulsed by German counter-attacks but managed to prevent an attempt to outflank Mont Cornillet from the west. By dark on 20 April, parts of the Moronvilliers Hills had been captured but had not been outflanked at either end. On the right, the French had reached the summit of Le Téton and were just below the crest of Le Casque. Further west, the French had a tenuous hold on the two summits of Mont Haut, had consolidated the top of Mont Blond and gained a foothold on Mont Cornillet. On the western flank, the French had been repulsed west of the Thuizy–Nauroy road. On 21 and 22 April, fighting for the redoubt and the observation posts continued and on 21 April, the Legionnaires, on the right flank of the Moroccan Division, stormed the German defences in front of the Main Boyau. The French alleged that German troops had feigned surrender, while hiding hand grenades in their raised hands, after which the Germans were all killed. The Main Boyau was entered, which made the redoubt south of Vaudesincourt untenable, which was captured with the 75th Territorial Regiment and part of the 185th Territorial Brigade on 22 April. On the left flank of the division, Bethmann-Hollweg Trench to the north-east of Mont Sans Nom, was captured along with six guns, which secured Mont Sans Nom from an attack against the eastern slope. sixty mortars and were captured by the Foreign Legion. On 25 April, the 34th Division was relieved by the 19th Division. Aftermath=Analysis In the attack of 17 April, the Fourth Army had swiftly reached the crest of the Moronvilliers massif but German observation over the battlefield had enabled accurate German artillery-fire against the French infantry. The attack had been costly, despite fog protecting the French infantry from the fire of some German machine-guns. Tunnels driven through the chalk connected the foremost German positions with the rear. German infantry could fire until the last moment then retire through them to the northern slopes. French heavy artillery-fire blocked some tunnels, subways, deep dugouts and caverns, entombing German troops and others were overrun and captured. As the French infantry encountered the German reverse- slope defences, fatigue, losses and the relatively undamaged state of the German positions, stopped the French advance. Possession of the crest was a substantial tactical advantage for the French, which denied the Germans observation to the south. The observation posts on the heights were highly vulnerable to German bombardment and surprise attacks, against which the French had to keep large numbers of infantry close to the front, ready to intervene but vulnerable to German artillery-fire. Ludendorff called the loss of the heights a \\"severe blow\\" and sixteen counter-attacks were made against the French positions along the heights in the next ten days, with little success. Casualties The French Fourth Army had casualties of Among the German casualties, were taken. Subsequent operationsMay= After divisional reliefs to replace the assault divisions, which were exhausted and had suffered many casualties, a new French attack began on 4 May. The west slopes of Mont Cornillet were attacked at and a small advance was made. A German counter-attack from the tunnel repulsed the attack except on the right, where the French captured an artillery battery and penetrated some way down the northern slope of Mont Blond. French casualties were so high that Vandenbergh postponed operations against Mont Cornillet and Flensburg trench. On 10 May, a French attack took a small amount of ground north-east of Mont Haut and a big German attack on Mont Téton was repulsed. Three fresh French divisions made preparations to resume the offensive on 20 May. After a big bombardment on the day before, the French attack began at in good weather, from south of Mont Cornillet to the north of Le Téton, with the main objective at the summit of Mont Cornillet. (On 17 May, Infantry Regiment 173 of the German 223rd Division had been relieved by Infantry Regiment 476 of the 242nd Division.) The new commander was unwilling to risk his men being bottled up in the Mont Cornillet tunnel and reduced the garrison from a regiment to six infantry companies, two machine-gun companies and fewer than The rest of the regiment occupied the pill-boxes and blockhouses on the summit and the north slope. On 19 May, as the French prepared to attack, news was received from a deserter that the garrison in the tunnel had been asphyxiated and an hour later, thirty Germans who had surrendered said the same but did not know if the tunnels had been reoccupied. To reach the crest of Mont Cornillet, the French had to advance up a steep slope swept by machine-gun fire. The French gained the crest after a costly advance and broke up into groups, which bombed and bayonetted their way through the German shell-hole positions and pillboxes, against enfilade fire from machine-guns in Flensburg Trench and the west slopes of Mont Blond. The summit was captured and the French began to descend the northern slopes, some moving beyond the final objective towards Nauroy. An Engineer company followed close behind the infantry, ready to block the tunnel entrances but found them difficult to find, because the bombardment had covered them up. At dusk, the French consolidated the craters on the northern crest; near midnight some German soldiers were captured as they headed for Nauroy, who turned out to be from the tunnel garrison and disclosed the main entrance. Just inside the tunnel, heaps of German dead were found, apparently having panicked and made a rush for the exit. More German dead were found in the tunnels, having been killed by the special gas shells fired by the French artillery. A survivor was rescued and the tunnel cleared and occupied until a German shell started a fire and the new garrison retired. The French attack between Mont Cornillet and the north of Le Téton on 20 May, failed on the north slope of Mont Blond and the north-west slopes of Mont Haut but succeeded to the north-east, north of Le Casque and Le Téton, where were taken. German losses in dead and wounded were considerable; in the Cornillet tunnel, more than were found. In 1918, the number of German prisoners taken since 17 April, was given as and The attacks on 20 May were the final stage of the Nivelle Offensive, in which most of the Chemin des Dames plateau, Bois des Buttes, Ville-aux-Bois, Bois des Boches and the German first and second lines, from the heights to the Aisne had been captured. In 1940, Cyril Falls, the British official historian, wrote that the Fourth Army attacks took and on the first day. German counter-attacks on 27 May had temporary success, before more French attacks recaptured the ground around Mont Haut; lack of troops had forced the Germans into piecemeal attacks instead of a simultaneous attack along all the front. =German 3rd Army counter-attacks= After the defeats of 20 May, the Germans counter-attacked the next day and were repulsed. On 23 May, an assault on Mont Haut was stopped by artillery-fire and on 25 May, the French took more ground on both sides of Mont Cornillet and took At dawn on 2 May, German attacks began at Le Téton and the French positions further east and gained temporary footholds in the French positions, before counter-attacks forced the German infantry back. In the afternoon, a German attack on the summit of Le Casque and more attacks at dusk on Le Casque and Le Téton failed, as did an attempt at dawn on 28 May; a raid against the French on Mont Blond and a fresh attack on Mont Blond on 30 May, also failed. After a gas bombardment on Mont Blond and the French lines north-west of Aubérive, German infantry attacked again at on 31 May, at Mont Haut, Le Casque and Le Téton. The German attacks continued all day and were eventually defeated in hand-to- hand fighting; some advanced posts north-east of Mont Haut were captured, until French counter-attacks managed to push the Germans back. By 3 June, Army Group German Crown Prince had recovered hardly any ground lost from on the Aisne front and on the Moronvilliers Heights. German counter-attacks had mostly been costly failures and from the Franco-British had taken and field guns, many trench mortars and more than =Minor operations= A surprise attack on 3 September, west of the St Hilaire–St Souplet road, caused considerable damage and several German prisoners were taken. Towards nightfall, French troops on a front, astride the Souain–Somme-Py road, entered the German lines and destroyed gas-tanks, blew up dugouts, rescued several French prisoners and returned safely with forty prisoners, four machine-guns and a trench mortar. More fighting took place on 5 September, at Le Teton and Le Casque. On 8 September, trench raiders to the east of the St Hilaire–St Souplet road, blew in dugouts and took twenty 20 prisoners. On 12 September, east of the St Hilaire–St Souplet road and north-east of Aubérive, more skirmishing took place. On 14 September, the French raided west of Navarin Farm and next day attacked in the area of Mt Haut. On 28 September, German raids were repulsed west of Navarin Farm, north-west of Tahure and at the Four-de-Paris in the Argonne. On 30 September, a raid was repulsed east of Aubérive, as the French were penetrating the German lines west of Mt Cornillet. On 1 October, the French raided north of Ville-sur-Tourbe and on 3 October, attacked west of Navarin Farm and at Le Casque. On 7 October, the French repulsed an attack at Navarin Farm, and on 9 October, destroyed several dugouts near the Butte-de-Tahure. After a 36-hour bombardment on the night of German storm-troops, in the Auberive–Souain area, attacked in three places and were eventually driven back. On 17 October, the Germans raided south-east of Juvincourt and on the northern slopes of Mt Cornillet; two days later the French raided north of Le Casque. On 22 October, the day before the Battle of La Malmaison, the French broke into the German lines south-east of St Quentin and in the Tahure region; on the morning of 23 October, German troops raided west of Hennericourt. On 24 October, French raids took place to the north-east of Prunay, at Mt Haut, north-west of Aubérive and near the Butte de Tahure. On 30 October, at the northern edge of the Moronvilliers heights, French troops raided east of Le Téton and repulsed two German counter-attacks but the third counter-attack recaptured the area.

It is located on the A107 Mare Street, where it crosses the Regent's Canal. The depot is occupied by two companies, CT Plus and Arriva London, and holds around thirty buses. Opened in 1981 by London Buses, it was closed in 1991 following the abandonment of the London Forest subsidiary, but reopened in 1994 by Kentish Bus. East Thames Buses have also used the site. History Ash Grove bus garage roundel Ash Grove is one of three new garages opened in 1981 by London Buses at a cost of £3.5 million. It had space for 140 buses undercover and a further 30 in the yard. The roof was unusual in being carried by ten 35-ton triangular trusses, said to be the largest in the UK, supported on reinforced concrete columns. The garage assumed Hackney's operation of Red Arrow routes 502 and 513 using new Leyland Nationals which had been stored at the garage, and the entire Hackney and Dalston allocations. When London Buses was split into eleven separate companies Ash Grove became part of the London Forest operation, but closed in 1991 when London Forest was wound up. 1990s The garage was re-opened in 1994 by Kentish Bus. This came about after then gained a small number of routes in the Leyton area, including former Boro'line route 108, although they referred to the garage as Cambridge Heath.McLachlan p.85 Ash Grove was also used at various times to house stored vehicles for the London Transport Museum.Arriva London - News - Ash Grove garage fully operational again 2000s Buses at Ash Grove Ash Grove re- opened again in 2000 for use by the London Buses company East Thames Buses which took over the former Harris Bus routes after that company ran into financial difficulties. Although East Thames Buses have now moved to new premises at Mandela Way, CT Plus moved into the garage yard to house its routes won in the London area. CT Plus use the garage to stable vehicles for routes 153, 212, 385, 388, 394, 812, W12, W13 and 675. Arriva London used the depot as the base for their new Citaro articulated buses for route 38 following the conversion from AEC Routemasters in November 2005. This has ended following the route's conversion back to double-deck operation, but routes 78 and 168 have been transferred to operate from the garage. Industrial relations The garage has suffered from a number of industrial relations difficulties in its history. In 1991 London Forest won a group of eleven tendered routes in the Walthamstow area on the basis of very low prices. This led to the company proposing a pay cut of around 18% to all staff, which saw staff at all of its four garages strike. Following these events the company was wound up and the garage closed. In June 2008 forty CT Plus employees based at the garage protested against the dismissal of a shop steward who had refused to drive a bus with a health and safety defect.Workers Revolutionary Party - 40 bus workers picket Ash Grove October 2010 saw strike action by CT Plus workers in a dispute over pay, although most services were not disrupted significantly.Hackney bus services continue despite strike  Eastlondonlines References Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Hackney Category:Bus garages in London ","title":"Ash Grove bus garage"},{"id":"24557388","text":"Canopy of Mian Nasir Muhammad Kalhoro Mian Nasir Muhammad Kalhoro (, ) was a famous pioneer and main ruler of Kalhora Dynasty who ruled over Sindh from 1657 AD to 1692 AD) and died in 1692 AD.

This garage closed in 1981 and was demolished, the site now contains housing. History A former cavalry barracks, Dalston Garage (coded D) was opened as a bus garage by the London General Omnibus Company in 1906. It was on Shrubland Road, opposite the junction with Albion Drive. This garage was closed operationally by London Transport in 1981, when it was replaced by the then new garage at Ash Grove. Hackney Well Street (coded H) was absorbed into Ash Grove at the same time. Ash Grove remained a London Transport garage until 1991. Dalston was notable in the mid-1970s that it ran two types of single decker on route S2 (Clapton Pond-Bromley Station) on comparative trials, to see which would be most suitable for future LT orders. S2 could only take single deckers, due to a number of low bridges en route. The trials began in 1973. The vehicles trialled were: 6 Leyland Nationals LS1-6 (TGY 101-6M) and 6 Metro Scanias MS1-6 (PGC 201-6L). The trials finished in 1976, when the Leyland National was selected as the new \\"Standard\\" LT single decker. LS1-6 didn't stay at Dalston though, they were transferred to Hounslow (AV) garage in west London. MS1-6 were all withdrawn. All bar MS2 passed to Newport Transport in South Wales. MS2 was retained by LT for further experimental premises, based at Chiswick. MS2 was subsequently preserved. Route S2 subsequently used Leyland Nationals, until the late 1980s when the service went over to midibus operation, initially with MR class Metroriders, and then RB class Renault S75s. The Renaults were superseded by Dennis Darts from the mid-1990s. Route S2 disappeared in 2008, when it became 488. When it closed, Dalston operated Routemasters (RM) and Leyland Nationals (LS).

History The cause of the decrease in silver content were the probate disputes between Emperor Frederick III and the master of his mint in Graz, Balthasar Eggenberger. As an independent entrepreneur, Balthasar was doing business at his own risk and his profit margin was based on the ratio of the value of the actual silver content of the coins against their value as currency. When the emperor increased the fees for the minting lease or raised taxes to pay debts, merchants had to pass that cost on by increasing prices or, as in the mint master's case, decreasing the actual amount of silver in the coinage thereby lowering the production cost of the coins against their value as currency. According to Austrian chronicler and contemporary of Balthasar's: \\"The emperor allowed bad coins to be minted; these coins were named Schinderlings. Anyone with lots of old copper kettles could mint better. He allowed such coins to be minted...by a citizen in Graz named Eggenberg, who had the lease on the minting operations in Graz and in St. Veit in Carinthia.\\"Jakob Unrest, \\"Österreichische Chronik von 1379 bis zirka 1500\\". K. Grossmann, Monumenta Germaniæ Historica, Scriptores rerum Germanicarum, N.S. 11, 1957, reprint 2001. According to another chronicle from the period, Balthasar became quite wealthy and influential through these activities until the emperor was forced to act in the spring of 1460. He issued an arrest warrant for Balthasar, who received word of the order and fled to Venice with what was a vast sum in gold, silver and jewels of about £40000. By July of that year Balthasar and the emperor had come to some sort of arrangement, the details of which have been lost. Through this arrangement Balthasar was to pay the emperor an unknown sum in exchange for renewal of the minting lease under the stipulation that the minted coins could not have less than a specified amount of silver and amnesty to return to his lands in Graz. This shortage of money for the payment of the mercenaries linked with the disputes between Balthasar and Emperor Frederick III created a financial crisis. The Schinderlingszeit (Schinderling era) was one of the first cases of open inflation in the German linguistic area shortly before the beginning of modern times. As a result of this the emperor also issued a decree in 1460 fixing wages and prices based on the value of better coins to be minted under the new agreement between the emperor and Balthasar.

He held a long correspondence with leading researchers and writers in Prussia and elsewhere, including Ernst Haeckel, Charles Darwin, Rudolf Virchow, Joseph Kürschner and Wilhelm Bölsche. In 1891, Zacharias was supported financially by the Prussian government and several private individuals to establish, on Großer Plöner See, the first \\"Biological Station\\" for limnology (freshwater research) based on German soil as a private research institute. The inspiration for this was the Stazione Zoologica founded in 1870 in Naples by Anton Dohrn, which was already highly recognized.Wetzel, N. / Nöthlich, R.: Vom „Homo literatus“ zum „Self made man“ – Der Werdegang des Emil Otto Zacharias. In: Mauritiana, 19 (2006), No. 3, p. 463–477. Zacharias was an advocate of Darwinism. He supported the evolutionary ideas of Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel.R. Nöthlich, N. Wetzel, U. Hoßfeld, L. (2006). Olsson: Ich acquirirte das Schwein sofort, ließ nach dem Niederstechen die Pfoten abhacken u. schickte dieselben an Darwin - Der Briefwechsel von Otto Zacharias mit Ernst Haeckel (1874–1898). Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11: 177-248. In 1877, Zacharias came across a strange monstrosity at a marketplace, a pig with thumbs developed on both forelimbs. Intrigued about the possibility of atavism, he purchased the pig and sent one of the feet to Darwin to ask for his opinion.Burkhardt, Frederick. (2017). The Correspondence of Charles Darwin: Volume 25; Volume 1877. Cambridge University Press. pp. 564-565. As the director Zacharias published research reports from 1893 on the activities at Plön station, which were recorded from 1905 in the Archives of Hydrobiology.Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Vol 20, Leipzig, 1909, p. 831 In so-called \\"summer schools\\" Zacharias trained teachers and laity interested in working with the microscope.Zacharias, O.: Ferienkurse in Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde an der Biologischen Station zu Plön, in: Archiv für Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde 4 (1909), p. 267–272. The Centre became known as the Max Planck Institute of Limnology. As of 2008 the Institute is no longer in the original building but still in Plon. It was renamed in April 2007 as part of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. Zacharias has a water mite Arrenurus zachariae Koenike, 1886 named after him.

Since 2001, the conference series has a biennial schedule. The conferences are one of the key ways of exchanging expertise about planning and design for cycling in New Zealand. Starting in 2012, the scope of the conference includes both walking and cycling, by combining the previous Living Streets Aotearoa biennial NZ Walking Conference series, and was rebranded \\"2WALKandCYCLE\\". The most recent conference was held in Palmerston North in July–August 2018.  Conference organisation  Initially, conference attendees and speakers were mainly cycle advocates, but the conferences have developed a broader appeal across all sectors that are involved in policy, promotion and provision for cyclists – such as from representatives from the NZ Transport Agency or local authorities. The conferences are organised by an organising committee made up of representatives of various organisations. In 2009, for example, these included Cycling Advocates' Network, NZ Transport Agency, Ministry of Health and New Plymouth District Council. When plans were made for what would have been the 2011 conference, it was considered whether it would be useful to have a combined event covering both walking and cycling. This was agreed to by Living Streets Aotearoa, the organiser of the NZ Walking Conference. The first combined walking and cycling conference, branded as 2WALKandCYCLE, was held from 22 to 24 February 2012 in Hastings. The conference was organised by representatives of Cycling Advocates' Network, Hastings District Council staff, Living Streets Aotearoa, New Zealand Transport Agency, and some individuals.

It was built in 1837 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 38148. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History De Zwaluw was built in 1837 by millwrights L Reinds of Beilen and B Sluter of De Groeve. The mill incorporated parts from a windmill at Schipborg which had been demolished. It replaced a post mill which itself had replaced a watermill on the Drentsche Aa river. The mill came into the ownership of the Greving family in 1876. It was worked by successive generations of the Greving family until 1947 when a sailstock broke. In 1951, millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen fitted a new cast-iron windshaft to replace the previous wooden one. This came from a windmill at Termunten, Groningen which had burnt down in 1944. A new pair of Patent sails was fitted at this time. The restored mill was officially opened on 27 September 1951. The mill was out of use from 1970 and in 1980 was purchased from the Greving family by the Gemeente Vries. A further restoration was undertaken in 1982. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 2008-09, further restoration work was carried out at the mill at a cost of €36,524. Description De Zwaluw is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante grondzeiler\\". It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of are carried in a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Fabrikaat Prins van Oranje of Den Haag, Zuid Holland in 1893. It has been lengthened by about for use in De Zwaluw. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 60 cogs. The brake wheel drives the wallower (31 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft the great spur wheel, which has 79 cogs, drives the diameter Cullen millstones via a lantern pinion stone nut which has 25 staves each. The millstones are driven overdrift. As of October 2009, the inner sail stock is the oldest surviving example made by Christiaan Bremer. Public access De Zwaluw is open on Saturdays from 11:00 to 16:00. During the summer months it is also open on Wednesdays from 14:00 to 16:00. (Click on \\"Informatie\\" to view.)

There is currently no plan to build the device; it remains a concept. The technology is based on current technologies, like e-paper and radio frequency. Design A \\"napkin\\" holder functions as a base-station for the technology. The base-station is filled with e-paper \\"napkins\\", as well as a place for some coloured pens. The user can simply pick up a pen and interact with the napkin using the pen. The napkin and pen communicate using short- range RF technology, while both connect with the base-station using long-range RF waves. Holleman has also stated that the napkins can easily be shared. The napkins are also modular. The pen wirelessly powers the napkin when it comes into close range. Production Images of the concept released by Holleman show the device running a variant of Windows. Holleman hopes that the Napkin PC will encourage creative groups to collaborate better because of the conference abilities of the concept. The device will require very little power. It will rely on not a battery, but a single-layer flexible circuit board for inductive power. Holleman also hopes that the device will help cut down on paper waste and reduce the need for printers in modern society.

The hill consists predominantly of porphyritic rock. The ruins represent a relatively well-preserved 12th-century castle. The keep behind the curtain walls, a tower in the north-western corner of the complex as well as the outer ward with half-round and angular towers, are still visible. Around the castle there appears to have been a moat.  History  An early medieval fortification was possibly erected at the location of the future castle around 750 by Count Ruodbrecht, one of Charlemagne's uncles. The original castle was built around 1100 by the Counts of Nagold, who became the Counts palatine of Tübingen in 1145. The castle complex was extensively expanded between 1153 and 1162. In the middle of the 13th century the castle passed into the possession of the Counts of Hohenberg. Thereafter, one branch of this family called itself Counts of Nagold and had the castle transformed into their residence in the 13th and 14th century. In 1364 the sold the castle to the Counts of Württemberg. The new owners added bastions and towers to the outer ward and had the castle occupied by their ministeriales. Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the castle was conquered by Bavarian troops in 1645 and severely damaged. In 1646 the remnants of the castle were pulled down. In 1945 the northwest tower was destroyed by a low-level attack carried out by Allied planes. The castle remains were tentatively restored after World War II, trying to preserve the castle as a ruin.

It stars Abhishek Bachchan, Kangana Ranaut, Anupam Kher, Sarah- Jane Dias, Shahana Goswami, Boman Irani, Gauahar Khan and Jimmy Sheirgill among others. The film is a stylish action thriller and is shot at locations in Mumbai, Samos Island in Greece,Game (2011 Hindi Film), ELINEPA, 2003 Istanbul, London and Bangkok. It is said to be in the same type of genre as The Bourne Identity trilogy. It is similar to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. The theatrical trailer was premiered in theatres with Anees Bazmee's No Problem on 10 December 2010. The film was released on 1 April 2011. Plot Kabir Malhotra (Anupam Kher) is a billionaire tycoon who invites four people to his island home in Greece, by sending a different letter to each. The four people, who have never met before, are: * Neil Menon (Abhishek Bachchan), a casino owner in Turkey. He has financial problems with mob bosses that Kabir offers to help with. * Vikram Kapoor (Jimmy Sheirgill), an actor in India, who suffers with drug and career problems. Kabir writes to him that he wants to finance the biggest film ever made, and offers Vikram a role in it. * OP Ramsay (Boman Irani), a political leader and presidential candidate in Thailand. His campaign is under threat of scandal, and Kabir offers to provide new funding to him. * Tisha Khanna (Shahana Goswami), a crime journalist in the United Kingdom who is looking for her big break. Kabir writes to her saying that he has a huge story and invites her to cover it. The four guests arrive on the island, where they are greeted by Kabir's personal assistant, Samara Shroff (Gauahar Khan), who takes them into a dining room that is being secretly filmed. There, Kabir reveals that he has invited them because of their link to his daughter, Maya (Sarah-Jane Dias), whom Kabir has spent years trying to find. Maya was trafficked as a child by OP Ramsay, as an adult brought into the crime world by Neil Menon, and in the end hit by a car in car accident and buried alive by Vikram Kapoor. Kabir has gathered evidence against the three of them and invited the International Vigilance Squad (IVS) to the island to arrest them. Tisha Khanna, the only innocent one of the group, was invited because, previously unknown to her, she is Maya's fraternal twin sister and Kabir's only remaining biological child. Tisha rejects Kabir's attempts to forge a relationship with her, claiming that she doesn't want his fortune. Unable to escape the island, the group await the arrival of the IVS. In the morning, they hear what sounds like a gunshot from Kabir's room. They find Kabir Malhotra dead in his study, seemingly having committed suicide with a gun. The IVS, led by Sia Agnihotri (Kangana Ranaut), arrive on the island. She watches the video of the previous night's speech by Kabir, but as they are unable to find the evidence that Kabir claimed to have, they let the guests go. Although the case is officially declared a suicide, Sia is not convinced and puts all four guests under surveillance. Through flashback, it is revealed that Neil was in love with Maya, who saved his life during a shootout at his casino. And also that on the day of her death, she told Neil through a voice mail that she was pregnant with their child. In the present day, Neil evades Sia's surveillance, and takes revenge on OP Ramsay and Vikram for what they did to Maya. Bothe are tricked into giving public confessions of their crimes. Vikram commits suicide, and OP Ramsay dies of a heart attack (his medication being stolen by Neil). Sia, who has been monitoring Vikram and OP Ramsay, knows that Neil is responsible. It is revealed that Neil is also an officer of the IVS. His real name is Major Arjun Singhania, and he has been in deep cover for many years in the Turkish drug cartel. He, too, doesn't believe that Kabir committed suicide, and works together with Sia to find the true culprit. Neil noticed that Kabir was left-handed, yet the gun that killed him was in his right hand. Tisha, as Kabir Malhotra's only child, is to inherit Kabir's fortune, but Neil and Sia receive news that Tisha attempted suicide. When Tisha wakes up, she tells them that it wasn't suicide, but someone attacked her in her house. Meanwhile, it is found that Kabir has a brother, Iqbal, who is next in line to inherit his fortune. Sia and Neil travel to the missionary where Iqbal lives, but they find him too ill to speak to them. A nurse tells them that Iqbal had a daughter who died, but Neil notices that there are letters sent to him dated after her supposed to death, so she must still be alive. Neil and Sia travel back to the island, where they confront the late Kabir's personal assistant, Samara. It is revealed that Samara is Iqbal's daughter and Kabir's biological niece, though Kabir never knew. Neil realised that there was foul play when, at the missionary, he saw a picture of Kabir and Iqbal when they were children, and they were identical twins, so the man in the missionary couldn't have been Kabir's brother. Iqbal reveals himself, explaining that he's been working with Samara to get Kabir's fortune. Tisha was a surprised they hadn't anticipated, so they had to take her out of the picture. They used Kabir's three guilty guests to deflect suspicion from Samara, predicting correctly that the police would suspect one of the guests as responsible for Kabir's murder. Iqbal attempts to kill Neil and Sia, but Neil resists, which results in Iqbal being killed and Samara arrested. Cast * Abhishek Bachchan as Neil Menon, a casino owner in Turkey.

When the U.S. television industry was in its infancy in the 1940s, there were four major full-time television networks that operated across the country: ABC, CBS, NBC and the DuMont Television Network. Never able to find solid financial ground, DuMont ceased broadcasting in August 1956. Many companies later began to operate television networks which aspired to compete against the Big Three. However, between the 1950s and the 1980s, none of these start-ups endured and some never even launched. After decades of these failed \\"fourth networks\\", many television industry insiders believed that creating a viable fourth network was impossible. Television critics also grew jaded, with one critic placing this comparison in the struggles of creating a sustaining competitor to the Big Three, \\"Industry talk about a possible full-time, full-service, commercial network structured like the existing big three, ABC, CBS and NBC, pops up much more often than the fictitious town of Brigadoon.\\" The first lasting attempt at a fourth network as DuMont went into decline was arguably the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC). Founded in 1953, it slowly grew into the NET network and then PBS by 1970. The October 1986 launch of the Fox Broadcasting Company was met with ridicule. Despite the industry skepticism and initial network instability, the Fox network eventually proved profitable by the early 1990s, becoming the first successful fourth network and eventually surpassing the Big Three networks in the demographics and overall viewership ratings by the early 2000s. Despite industry skepticism, early struggles in launching hit programs, and ridicule, the Fox network eventually proved profitable by the early 1990s, becoming the first fourth commercial network since DuMont to gain parity with the Big Three. Background In the 1940s, four television networks began operations by linking local television stations together via AT&T;'s coaxial cable telephone network. These links allowed stations to share television programs across great distances, and allowed advertisers to air commercial advertisements nationally. Local stations became affiliates of one or more of the four networks, depending on the number of licensed stations within a given media market in this early era of television broadcasting. These four networks – the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and the DuMont Television Network – would be the only full-time television networks during the 1940s and 1950s, as in 1948, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) suspended approvals for new station construction permits. Although other companies – including Paramount Pictures and the Mutual Broadcasting System – announced network plans or began limited network operations, these companies withdrew from television after the first few years. The FCC's \\"freeze,\\" as it was called, was supposed to last for six months. When it was lifted after four years in 1952, there were only four full-time television networks. The FCC would only license three local VHF stations in most U.S. television markets. A fourth station, the FCC ruled, would have to broadcast on the UHF band. Hundreds of new UHF stations began operations, but many of these stations quickly folded because television set manufacturers were not required to include a UHF tuner until 1964 as part of the All-Channel Act. Most viewers could not receive UHF stations, and most advertisers would not advertise on stations which few could view. Without the advertising revenue enjoyed by the VHF stations, many UHF station owners either returned their station licenses to the FCC, attempted to trade licenses with educational stations on VHF, attempted to purchase a VHF station in a nearby market to move into theirs, or cut operating costs in attempts to stay in business . Since there were four networks but only three VHF stations in most major U.S. cities, one network would be forced to broadcast on a UHF outlet with a limited audience. NBC and CBS had been the larger networks, and the most successful broadcasters in radio. As they began bringing their popular radio programs and stars into the television medium, they sought – and attracted – the most profitable VHF television stations. In many areas, ABC and DuMont were left with undesirable UHF stations, or were forced to affiliate with NBC or CBS stations on a part- time basis. ABC was near bankruptcy in 1952; DuMont's network was unprofitable after 1953. On August 6, 1956, DuMont ceased regular network operations; the end of DuMont allowed ABC to experience a profit increase of 40% that year, although ABC would not reach parity with NBC and CBS until the 1970s. The end of the DuMont Network left many UHF stations without a reliable source of programming, and many were left to become independent stations. Several new television companies were formed through the years in failed attempts to band these stations together in a new fourth network.

While critics rejected \\"the nightly tripe being offered [to] the public on the three major networks,\\" they were skeptical that a fourth network would offer better material: \\"[O]ne wonders if a new network lacking the big money already being spread three ways will be able to come up with tripe that is equal. Certainly a new network is not going to stress quality programming when the ratings indicate that the American public prefer hillbillies, cowboys and spies. A new network will have to deliver an audience if it is to attract the big spenders from the ranks of sponsors.\\" Advertisers, too, called for the creation of a fourth network. Representatives from Procter & Gamble and General Foods, two of the largest advertisers in the U.S., hoped the competition from a fourth network would lower advertising rates on the Big Three. Independent television producers, too, called for a fourth network after battles with the Big Three.

The plan was to sign 45 to 50 affiliate stations; each of these stations would have input in deciding what programs the network would air. Four initial programs – Jack for Jill, I'm the Champ, Answer Me This, and It's a Living – were slated to be broadcast; the programs would be filmed in Hollywood. However, only 17 stations had agreed to affiliate in May. The film network never made it off the ground, and none of the planned programs aired. =Sports Network/Hughes Network= Also in 1956, Dick Bailey founded the Sports Network, a specialty television network which aired only sports programs. Millionaire Howard Hughes purchased the network in 1968, changing its name to the Hughes Television Network. Speculation abounded that Hughes would add non-sports programs to the lineup, launching a fourth network. One television critic speculated \\"If Hughes does have the exciting sports programs they can change viewer's dialing habits. If dialing habits are changed might he extend his network facilities to include nonsport programming? It would be one way, less costly and with far less of a risk, to start the illusionary fourth network.\\" Despite the speculation, the Hughes Network never offered non-sports programs and never developed into a fourth major television network. =Mutual Broadcasting System= The Mutual Broadcasting System, as one of the four major radio networks that existed at the time, was considered a candidate for creating a fourth network. When Mutual came under the ownership of General Tire's General Teleradio along with five television stations, General Tire president Thomas F. O'Neil started putting a potential Mutual all-movie network together. Mutual purchased a large group of English films and paid $1.5 million for the right of unlimited play for two years of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry westerns. =NTA Film Network= On October 15, 1956, National Telefilm Associates launched the NTA Film Network, a syndication service which distributed both films and television programs to independent television stations and stations affiliated with NBC, CBS or ABC; the network had signed agreements with over 100 affiliate stations. The ad hoc network's flagship station was WNTA-TV (channel 13) in New York City. The NTA Network was launched as a \\"fourth TV network,\\" and trade papers of the time referred to it as a new television network. Despite this major fourth network effort, by 1961 WNTA-TV was losing money, and the network's flagship station was sold to the Educational Broadcasting Corporation that November. WNTA-TV became WNDT (later WNET), the flagship station of the National Educational Television network, a forerunner of PBS. NTA network operations did not continue without a flagship station, although parent company National Telefilm Associates continued syndication services.

According to one source, the network would have been called the Pat Weaver Prime Time Network. Although the new network was announced, no programs were ever produced. =Unisphere/Mizlou= In mid-1965, radio businessman Vincent C. Piano proposed the Unisphere Broadcasting System. The service would have operated for 2½ hours each night. However, Piano had difficulty signing affiliates; a year later, no launch date had been set, and the network still lacked a \\"respectable number of affiliates in major markets.\\" The network finally launched under the name Mizlou Television Network in 1968, but the concept had changed. Like the Hughes Network, Mizlou only carried occasional sporting and special events. Despite developing a sophisticated microwave and landline broadcasting system, the company never developed into a major television network. =National Educational Television= Educational television (ETV) had existed since 1952, but was poorly funded. Only a few educational television stations existed during the 1950s. By 1962, 62 educational stations were in operation, most of which had affiliated with the non-commercial educational, National Educational Television (NET). That year, the U.S. Congress approved $32 million in funding for educational television, giving a boost to the non- commercial television network. Although at the 1962 revamp of the organization, NET was branded a \\"fourth network\\", later historians have disagreed. McNeil (1996) stated, \\"in a sense, NET was less a true network than a distributor of programs to educational stations throughout the country; it was not until late 1966 that simultaneous broadcasting began on educational outlets.\\" =Overmyer/United Network= Millionaire Daniel Overmyer built a chain of five UHF stations during the mid-1960s. In late 1966, Overmyer announced plans for a new fourth network, named the Overmyer Network. The name was later changed to the United Network, but the network itself broadcast only for a single month, and aired only one program, The Las Vegas Show. The lack of reliable VHF stations helped kill the new, unprofitable network. Shortly after the network ceased operations, one critic called Overmyer/United a fiasco, and likened it to the earlier DuMont, NTA Film Network and Weaver network failures. =Westinghouse or Metromedia= By the late 1960s, several fourth networks had vanished. Television set manufacturers were required to include a UHF tuner after 1964, and it was thought this would help UHF stations and any company hoping to band (mostly) UHF stations together in a fourth network. Two companies, Westinghouse and Metromedia, were floated in 1969 as possible fourth network entries. Westinghouse was the owner of several VHF stations and produced several series which aired on its stations and those owned by other companies; along with General Electric and GE subsidiary RCA, Westinghouse was also a cofounder of NBC in 1926 before both GE and Westinghouse had to divest their shares for antitrust reasons in 1930. (GE would later repurchase RCA in 1986.) However, Donald McGannon, president of Westinghouse, estimated it would take $200 million per year to operate a full- time television network and a modest news department. McGannon denied his company had full network aspirations. Decades later, Westinghouse would later purchase CBS and adopt that network's identity while divesting itself of its legacy industrial businesses. Metromedia, the successor company to the defunct DuMont Network, was a healthy chain of independent television stations. Although Metromedia \\"dabbled at creating a fourth network,\\" the company was content with offering series to independent stations on a part-time basis, \\"nowhere near the conventional definition of a network.\\" =Kaiser Broadcasting= In September 1967, the Kaiser Broadcasting Company announced plans for live network operations by 1970. Kaiser owned eight UHF television stations, most of them in large cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, and Detroit. The planned network never gained traction, and Kaiser sold the stations in 1977. 1970s In the 1970s, the \\"occasional\\" television networks started to appear with greater frequency with Norman Lear, Mobil Showcase Network, Capital Cities Communications, and Operation Prime Time, all entering the fray along with Metromedia. In 1978, SFM Media Service, which assisted with the Mobil Showcase Network, launched its own occasional network, the SFM Holiday Network and the General Foods Golden Showcase Network. SFM was a provider of ad hoc network as a service to other clients including Del Monte Foods.

MFN was created to fill the family programming void from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. due to the implementation of the Prime Time Access Rule, using movies from the MGM library scheduled to air on one Sunday every two months. The premiere of MFN registered a 40 rating. The network broadcast only four times a year in September, January, March and May, and had 14 films assigned to the network from the MGM library. =MetroNet= In 1976, Metromedia teamed up with Ogilvy and Mather for a proposed linking of independent television stations called MetroNet. The proposed programming would consist of several family dramas on Sunday nights, a half-hour serial and a gothic series similar to Dark Shadows on weeknights, and a variety program hosted by Charo on Saturdays. The plans for MetroNet failed when advertisers balked at Metromedia's advertising rate, which was only slightly lower than that of each of the Big Three, and low national coverage, leaving for Operation Prime Time. =Operation Prime Time= Operation Prime Time (OPT) was a consortium of American independent television stations to develop prime time programming for independent stations. OPT and its spin-off syndication company, Television Program Enterprises (TPE), were formed by Al Masini. During its existence, OPT was considered the de facto fourth television network.MarketWire via Yahoo! Finance, December 1, 2010 Prime Time planned three book adaptions for their shows to air in May, July and November or December 1978 with two of them being John Jakes's The Bastard and The Rebels leading the way for the rest of the book series that OPT optioned including two then currently being written. Martin Gosch's and Richard Hammer's The Last Testimony of Lucky Luciano was the third adaptation scheduled for 1978. =Paramount Television Service= In 1977, Paramount Pictures made tentative plans to launch the Paramount Television Service, or Paramount Programming Service, a new fourth television network. Paramount also purchased the Hughes Network, including its satellite time. Set to launch in April 1978, it would have initially consisted only one night a week of programming for three hours, with 30 Movies of the Week that would have followed Star Trek: Phase II on Saturday nights. PTVS was delayed until the 1978-79 season due to advertisers that were cautious of purchasing commercial slots on the planned network. This plan was aborted when executives decided the venture would be too costly, with no guarantee of profitability. Paramount continued to produce television programs for the Big Three networks and Operation Prime Time, as well as first-run syndication. Paramount would eventually create a network, UPN, in 1993. 1980s A few ad-hoc networks were in developed during the 1980s as conventional full-time networks were not buying theatrical feature films as much due to declining ratings for those telecasts, with networks arguing that pay television channels and videotapes had reduced the demand for films compared to those seen in the 1960s and 1970s. The studios considered the fact that the networks usually ran their films during rating sweeps periods up against other theatrical films, as being the cause of the slide in viewership. These ad-hoc networks, formed by an advertiser or studio, would provide to the production companies ratings histories that the pay services could not provide for sales in a syndicated package, and only tie up the movie for a two-week window. These were set up using a barter system, with the network retaining five minutes per hour of ad time. Besides the Premiere Network and Debut Network, Orion Pictures, Warner Bros. and a joint venture of Viacom and Tribune Broadcasting all followed suit in announcing the launch of their own ad-hoc networks in late 1984. =Golden Showcase Network= The Kraft General Foods Golden Showcase Network, or Golden Showcase, was launched in 1980 with assistance from SFM and ran at least to 1989. Programs on the Golden Showcase included The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank and Little Girl Lost. =MGM/UA Premiere Network= The Premiere Network, or MGM/UA Premiere Network, was an ad-hoc network created by MGM/United Artists, which announced plans to launch in 1984, originally set for an October launch. By that summer, the network had signed affiliation agreements with eight television stations in large markets. The service was expected to broadcast 24 movies in double-runs once a month for two years. MGM received 10½ minutes of advertising time within a two-hour movie telecast, while its stations would retain 11½ minutes. 100 television stations were signed as affiliates by October 1984, with the planned launch pushed back and set for November 10 of that year. =Debut Network= The Universal Pictures Debut Network, or simply the Debut Network, was a similar ad-hoc film network created by MCA Television. The service reached agreements with ten stations in larger markets such as New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago by late 1984. The network planned to launch in two stages beginning in September 1985. In 1988, the movie network broadcast a special edition of Dune as a two-night event, with additional footage not included in the film's original release. In June 1990, the Debut Network was ranked in fifth place among the ten highest- rated syndicated programs according to Nielsen. =Premier Program Service= Premier Program Service (PPS) was born out of MCA/Universal and Paramount Communications' respective entries for ownership of TV stations. MCA had purchased WWOR-TV in New York City in 1986 (shortly before its license was relocated to Secaucus, New Jersey), while Paramount purchased a controlling interest in five independent and Fox-affiliated stations from TVX Broadcast Group in 1989 (which formed the cornerstones of the Paramount Stations Group, after it acquired the remaining interest in TVX two years later). MCA Television and Paramount Domestic Television (PDT) had formed Premier Advertiser Sales, a joint venture created for advertising sales of their existing syndicated programs in September 1989, from which PPS likely took its name and served as an outgrowth. By October 1989, MCA and Paramount were shopping the planned network to potential affiliates with WWOR and Paramount's stations as the core charter outlets. The partners were even approaching Fox- affiliated stations to affiliate with PPS, given that Premier's initial proposed schedule did not conflict with Fox's prime time schedule (which ran Saturday through Mondays at the time) and as an effort to make the network viable. Fox was expected to lose at least one affiliate to Premier in Paramount's Philadelphia station WTXF-TV. The network was planned for a January 1, 1991 launch with two nights of programming set to air in the first year (consisting of movies on Wednesdays and series produced by the two partner companies on Fridays) and a third night (consisting of a movie block on Thursdays) before the end of the year. The two series were said to be similar to 21 Jump Street and Star Trek: The Next Generation. By February 1990, Paramount Communications and MCA Inc. had disbanded their plans to launch the Premier Program Service after Fox objected to their solicitation of its affiliates to serve as its charter outlets. Fox By 1985, there were 267 independent television stations operational in the U.S., most of which were broadcasting on UHF. In May 1985, News Corporation paid $1.55 billion to acquire six independent stations in major U.S. cities from Metromedia. In October 1985, 20th Century Fox (which News Corporation founder Rupert Murdoch purchased the previous year) announced the formation of Fox Broadcasting Company, an independent television system, to compete with the three major television networks. 20th Century Fox's television division would partner with the former Metromedia stations to both produce and distribute programming. Because Metromedia was a company descended from the DuMont Television Network, radio personality Clarke Ingram has argued that Fox was essentially not a new fourth network per se, but DuMont \\"rising from the ashes\\". Former DuMont stations like WNYW in New York City and WTTG in Washington, D.C. became charter affiliates of the new network. Fox debuted on October 6, 1986, with 88 affiliates, many of them UHF stations; the network started with only a single program, The Late Show, a late-night talk show hosted by Joan Rivers, which attempted (and mightily struggled) to compete against NBC stalwart The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Fox expanded into prime time in two phases over the course of three months starting in April 1987, running two hours of programming per night on Saturdays and Sundays. The new network was ridiculed by critics and scorned by executives of the Big Three networks. They believed that Fox, like previous fourth networks, would be limited by being on UHF stations which had poor viewership and mediocre signal reception. NBC entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff dismissively nicknamed Fox \\"the coat hanger network,\\" implying that viewers would need to attach wire hangers (often used as a free alternative to set-top loop antennas used to receive UHF signals) to their television sets to view the network's shows. NBC head Grant Tinker declared, \\"I will never put a fourth column on my schedule board. There will only be three.\\" Indeed, just two years into its existence, the network was still struggling, and Fox executives considered pulling the plug on the network. By 1990, however, Fox had cracked the top 30 in the Nielsen ratings through the surprise success of The Simpsons (an animated series spun off from The Tracey Ullman Show, one of the network's initial series), which became the first series from a fourth network to enter the top 30 since the demise of DuMont more than 30 years earlier.Highest-rated series is based on the annual top-rated programs list compiled by Nielsen Media Research and reported in: By then, Fox had some advantages that DuMont did not have back in the 1950s. During its first few years, Fox programmed just under the number of hours to be legally considered a network by the FCC (by carrying only two hours of programming a few nights a week, expanding to additional nights before eventually filling all seven nights in 1993), allowing it to make money and grow in ways that the established networks were prohibited from doing. News Corporation also had more resources and money to hire and retain programming and talent than DuMont. In addition, the expansion of cable television in the 1980s and 1990s allowed more viewers to receive UHF stations clearly (along with local VHF stations), through cable systems, without having to struggle with either over-the-air antennas or television sets with limited channel tuners to receive them. The Foxnet cable channel began operations in June 1991 to provide Fox's programming to smaller markets that were not served by an over-the-air Fox affiliate or one of the few superstations that carried the network. Boosted by successful shows like Married... with Children, 21 Jump Street, COPS, Beverly Hills, 90210, In Living Color, Melrose Place, and The X-Files (all appealing to the highly coveted and lucrative 18-49 demographic), Fox proved profitable by the 1990s. In December 1993, Fox hit a major milestone when it won the rights to NFL football games from CBS, a move that by most accounts firmly established it as the fourth major television network. Soon afterward, Fox convinced several affiliates of the other networks (mostly CBS) to switch to Fox.

In the shadow of Fox's launch, Channel America was founded in 1987 as a network made up of low-power television stations; it launched in 1988 and added some cable-only affiliates. With the success with Fox Broadcasting Company, several other companies started to enter the fray in the 1990s to become the fifth commercial broadcast network that would allow a station to brand itself better and to stand out amongst the increasing number of channels particularly cable. Chris-Craft Industries and Warner Bros. Television Distribution (syndication arm) jointly launched the Prime Time Entertainment Network in September 1993, a consortium created in attempt at creating a new \\"fifth network.\\" PTEN, Spelling Premiere Network, Family Network and the proposed WB Network & Paramount Network were being shopped in January 1994 against syndicated blocks Disney Afternoon and Universal's \\"Action Pack.\\" Spelling Premiere Network had launched in August 1994. All American Television considered launching a first- run movie network with 22 movies as of November 1994. Chris-Craft subsidiary United Television then partnered with Paramount (by then recently merged with Viacom) to create the United Paramount Network (UPN), which launched in January 1995. Warner Bros. parent Time Warner then formed a partnership with the Tribune Company to create The WB, which also launched less than a week after UPN made its debut. Concurrently, United left PTEN's parent, the Prime Time Consortium, to focus on UPN, leaving PTEN as primarily a syndicator of its remaining programs; the service shared affiliations with its respective parents' own network ventures (in some cases, resulting in PTEN's programming airing in off-peak time slots) until it finally folded in September 1997. In March 1998, USA Broadcasting's CityVision was called a network (one of eight) by then-NBC president Bob Wright. Testing was launched in June 1998 on USA's Miami station WAMI. CityVision was more of a local format that the company planned to use on additional channels. Paxson Communications decided to create an alternative to the six existing networks in 1998, by creating Pax TV, a network launched to provide family-oriented entertainment programs. In September 1999, NBC and Pax TV became affiliated networks when NBC purchased a 32% share of Paxson Communications; NBC later sold its share in the network back to Paxson in 2003. Pax struggled to gain an audience, eventually dropping entertainment programming in daytime slots in favor of running infomercials; it eventually relaunched as a general entertainment network, under the name i: Independent Television, in July 2005 and became Ion Television in September 2007 (the network would gradually expand entertainment programming on its schedule over the succeeding seven years, refocusing on mainly reruns of network drama series and feature films). In 2000, Viacom purchased CBS placing UPN under common ownership with CBS, as a result of changes to FCC ownership rules that allowed the formation of duopolies (common ownership of two television stations within one media market). The WB, UPN and Pax all struggled throughout their existences, although they managed to gain a few hit series over their 11 years on the air (such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Star Trek: Voyager, America's Next Top Model, 7th Heaven, and Dawson's Creek). The WB and UPN launched at a time when cable and satellite television had begun eroding viewership of even the four major networks, resulting in few WB and UPN series earning ratings registering above 5 million total viewers. Both networks had suffered from issues in recruiting affiliates, as many mid-sized and small markets had only five or fewer commercial stations, forcing either The WB, UPN, or both to settle for sharing programming time on a single station (in a few cases, being carried on an existing ABC, NBC, CBS, or Fox station); however, in some of these markets, only one or neither of the two networks was able to gain over-the-air clearance (The WB remedied this by striking a deal with Chicago affiliate WGN-TV to carry the network on its then-superstation feed at its launch, before starting a group of mainly cable- only affiliates in September 1998). The WB and UPN struggled to gain new hits by 2005, and speculation constantly arose as to whether they would pull the plug. In September 2006, UPN and The WB ended operations, and their respective parent companies (CBS Corporation and Time Warner) decide to combine their programming and management to form The CW. Foxnet also ended operations at around the same time, as more Fox affiliates had signed on in smaller markets since the mid-1990s. The launch of The CW and that network's decision to make Tribune's WB stations and CBS Television Stations' UPN outlets the core of its charter affiliate group left Fox Television Stations' soon-to-be-former UPN affiliates without a network; because of this, Fox launched a secondary network, MyNetworkTV, which debuted two weeks before The CW launched. Although The CW eventually found some modest footing, MyNetworkTV constantly struggled to sustain a wide audience, first with its initial telenovela format and later with its reality and film-focused lineup. Fox would convert MyNetworkTV into a programming service in September 2009, relying solely on reruns of drama series originally aired by other broadcast and cable networks. Additional networks were formed with increasing frequency immediately before and especially following the digital television transition, which gave stations the ability to multiplex their broadcast signals by adding subchannels, many of which since 2009 are being used to host networks focusing less or not at all on original content and relying mainly on programming acquired by various distributors (particularly classic series and feature films that are no longer being picked up by many cable networks).

The editors who published the text claimed that it contained the Hebrew word yahad (יחד). This word is also used in a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls, where it has usually been translated as \\"community\\", and is generally taken to be a self-reference to the group responsible for the scrolls in which it appears (and, by extension, the corpus as a whole). The presence of this unusual term in both the scrolls (found in the nearby caves) and on the ostracon (found at the ruins themselves) would connect the scrolls to the settlement at Qumran. Ostracon James F. Strange of the University of South Florida led an excavation which examined an area just outside the eastern wall of the settlement. One of the volunteers came upon the piece of ceramic and immediately lifted it out of its context to notice that there was writing on the other side. Strange had been removing dump material from a previous excavation with the aim to reach virgin soil, so the ostracon was found close to the original soil level. Further examination revealed a second piece.Doudna, footnote #3. The ostracon yielded eighteen lines of text, though much of the latter part is extremely fragmentary. In 1997 Frank Moore Cross and Esti Eshel published the text with drawing, transcription and translation. \\"According to the editors' interpretation, a certain man named Ḥoni gave his slave Ḥisday, his home, fig and olive trees to Eleazar, the treasurer or bursar of the Qumran community.\\"Calloway 1997, p. 145. This was a dramatic link between the site of Qumran and the scrolls themselves, which talk about this community, usually referred to as the Yahad. As Cross and Eshel put it, \\"The word Yahad, which appears on this ostracon, establishes the connection between Khirbet Qumran and the scrolls which were found in the nearby caves.\\"Cross 1997, p. 28. Line 8 and yahad Cross and Eshel translated line 8 thus: \\"when he fulfills (his oath) to the Community (יחד, ie yahad)\\".Cross 1997, p. 22. \\"If the reading lyḥd is correct – and it seems without serious objection (the dalet at the edge of the ostracon is certain) – we must suppose that the reference is to Honi's fulfilling his vow and entering the Community at Qumran, or to his fulfilment of his year as a neophyte, after which he assigns all of his estate to the community.\\"Cross 1997, p. 25. The publication immediately provoked controversy because not only did the transcription include the word yahad, but most who looked at photos of the original artifact could not see the letters that Cross and Eshel saw that should make up the word. This provoked various scholarly published responses. Yardeni translated the line \\"and every oth[er(?)] tree\\", the word \\"other\\" (אחר) being placed last in Hebrew word order and instead of Cross and Eshel's certain dalet Yardeni posited a resh, which is similar in form. More problematic is the first letter which Yardeni reads as an alef.Yardeni 1997. Golb published a brief comment advocating that the first two letters appear to be a gimel or nun and an alef (rather than a rare form of het), while it was a moot point whether the third letter was \\"the upper miniscule [sic] portion of a daleth\\".Golb 1997, pp. 172–73. F.H. Cryer also published a differing opinion on the ostracon.Cryer, F.H., \\"The Qumran Conveyance: A Reply to F.M. Cross and E. Eshel\\", Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament 11 (1997), 232–40. Most scholars agree that the text was a deed and the majority of those accept that it was a deed of gift. Few see any reference to the Yahad. In 2000 Cross and Eshel published the ostracon in volume 36 of the Discoveries in the Judaean Desert (DJD) series with the yahad reading intact, despite the scholarly disapproval which had been aired since the initial publication in 1997.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. is, originally, a term used as a self-designation by Indo-Iranian peoples in ancient times, in contrast to \\"non-Indo-Aryan\\" or \\"non-Iranian\\" peoples. In Ancient India, the term ā́rya- was used by the Indo-Aryan speakers of the Vedic period as a religious label for themselves, as well as the geographic region known as Āryāvarta, where the Indo-Aryan culture emerged.Michael Cook (2014), Ancient Religions, Modern Politics: The Islamic Case in Comparative Perspective, Princeton University Press, p.68: \\"Aryavarta [...] is defined by Manu as extending from the great Himalayas in the north to the Vindhyas of Central India in the south and from the sea in the west to the sea in the east.\\" Similarly, ancient Iranian peoples used the term airya- as an ethnic label for themselves and in reference to their mythical homeland, Airyanem Vaejah, in the Avesta scriptures. The root also forms the etymological source of the place names Iran and Alania. alt= Although the root *h₂er(y)ós (\\"a member of one’s own group\\", in contrast to an outsider) is most likely of Proto-Indo- European (PIE) origin, the use of Arya as an ethno-cultural self-designation is only attested among Indo-Iranian peoples, and it is not known if PIE speakers had a term to designate themselves as a group. In any case, scholars point out that, even in ancient times, the idea of being an \\"Aryan\\" was religious, cultural and linguistic, not racial.Reza Zia-Ebrahimi, Iranian Identity, the 'Aryan Race,' and Jake Gyllenhaal, PBS (Public Broadcasting Service), 6 August 2010. Drawing on misinterpreted references in the Rigveda by Western scholars in the 19th century, the term \\"Aryan\\" was adopted as a racial category by French writer Arthur de Gobineau, whose ideology of race was based on an idea of blond northern European \\"Aryans\\" who had migrated across the world and founded all major civilizations, before being diluted through racial mixing with local populations. Through the works of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Gobineau's ideas later influenced the Nazi racial ideology which saw the \\"Aryan race\\" as innately superior to other putative racial groups. The atrocities committed in the name of this racial ideology have led academics to avoid the term \\"Aryan\\", which has been replaced in most cases by \\"Indo-Iranian\\", with only the South Asian branch still being called \\"Indo-Aryan\\".  Etymology  The English word \\"Aryan\\" (originally spelt \\"Arian\\") was borrowed from the Sanskrit word ā́rya (आर्य) during the 18th century.Oxford English Dictionary: \\"Aryan from Sanskrit Arya 'Noble'\\"Thomas R. Trautman (2004): \\"Aryan is from Arya a Sanskrit word\\"; page xxxii of Aryans And British IndiaEncyclopædia Britannica: \\" ...the Sanskrit term arya (\\"noble\\" or \\"distinguished\\"), the linguistic root of the word (Aryan)...\\" \\"It is now used in linguistics only in the sense of the term Indo-Aryan languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family\\" It is thought to be the self-designation used by all Indo-Iranian people in ancient times.William Hansen, Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science by Stefan Arvidsson (Book review) , Journal of Folklore Research, 22 February 2007.  Indo-Iranian  One of the earliest epigraphically attested reference to the word arya occurs in the 6th-century BC Behistun inscription, which describes itself as having been composed \\"in arya [language or script]\\" (§ 70). As is also the case for all other Old Iranian language usage, the arya of the inscription does not signify anything but \\"Iranian\\".cf. , p. 2. Archeologist J.P. Mallory argues that \\"As an ethnic designation, the word [Aryan] is most properly limited to the Indo-Iranians\\". In early Vedic literature, the term Āryāvarta (Sanskrit: आर्यावर्त, abode of the Aryans) was the name given to northern India, where the Indo-Aryan culture was based. The Manusmṛti (2.22) gives the name Āryāvarta to \\"the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)\\".Michael Cook (2014), Ancient Religions, Modern Politics: The Islamic Case in Comparative Perspective, Princeton University Press, p.68: \\"Aryavarta [...] is defined by Manu as extending from the Himalayas in the north to the Vindhyas of Central India in the south and from the sea in the west to the sea in the east.\\" Initially the term was used as a national name to designate those who worshipped the Vedic deities (especially Indra) and followed Vedic culture (e.g. performance of sacrifice, Yajna).Encyclopaedic dictionary of Vedic terms, Volume 1 By Swami Parmeshwaranand, pages 120 to 128 The Avestan term airya ('venerable') and the Old Persian ariya are also derivates of *aryo-, and were likewise used as self-designations. In Iranian languages, the original self-identifier lives on in ethnic names like \\"Alans\\" and \\"Iron\\". Similarly, the name of Iran is the Persian word for the land or place of the Aryans.Wiesehofer, Joseph Ancient Persia New York:1996 I.B. Tauris  Proto- Indo-Iranian  The Sanskrit term comes from proto-Indo-Iranian *arya-E. Laroche, Hommages à G. Dumézil, Brussels, 1960 or *aryo-, the name used by the Indo-Iranians to designate themselves. *Indo-Iranian: *arya-, **Avestan airya- meaning Aryan, Iranian in the larger sense, **Old Indo-Aryan ari- meaning attached to, faithful, devoted person and kinsman; aryá- meaning kind, favourable, attached to and devoted; árya- meaning Aryan, faithful to the Vedic religion.  Proto-Indo-European  It has been argued that the word is derived from the theorized Proto-Indo-European language, deriving from the reconstructed root word *h₂er(y)ós (\\"members of one's own group, peer, freeman\\"). Cognates may include: * the Hittite prefix arā- meaning member of one's own group, peer, companion and friend; *Celtic *aryo-, \\"freeman\\", **Gaulish: arios, \\"freeman, lord\\", **Old Irish: aire, \\"freeman, noble, chief\\", *Old Norse: arjosteR, \\"noble, most distinguished\\" (perhaps from Germanic *arjaz), The word *h₂er(y)ós itself is believed to have come from the root *h₂er- meaning \\"put together\\". The original meaning in Proto-Indo-European had a clear emphasis on the \\"in-group status\\" as distinguished from that of outsiders, particularly those captured and incorporated into the group as slaves. While in Anatolia, the base word has come to emphasize personal relationship, in Indo-Iranian the word has taken a more ethnic meaning. A review of numerous other ideas, and the various problems with each is given by Oswald Szemerényi.Szemerényi, Oswald (1977), \\"Studies in the Kinship Terminology of the Indo-European Languages\\", Acta Iranica III.16, Leiden: Brill pp 125–146 According to Szemerényi it is probably a Near-Eastern loanword from the Ugaritic ary, kinsmen.  Modern usage = Scholarship  * Proto-Indo-Europeans: during the 19th century, it was proposed that \\"Aryan\\" was also the self-designation of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, a hypothesis that has been abandoned. * \\"Aryan language family\\": the Indo-Aryan languages (including the Dardic), Iranian languages and Nuristani languages,  Nazism and white supremacy  Arno Breker's sculpture Die Partei (The Party), demonstrating the ideal characteristics of a Nordic Aryan. During the 19th century it was proposed that \\"Aryan\\" was also the self-designation of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Based on speculations that the Proto-Indo-European homeland was located in northern Europe, a 19th-century hypothesis which is now abandoned, the word developed a racialist meaning. The Nazis used the word \\"Arier\\" meaning \\"Aryan\\" to describe people in a racial sense. The Nazi official Alfred Rosenberg believed that the Nordic race was descended from Proto-Aryans, who he believed had prehistorically dwelt on the North German Plain and who had ultimately originated from the lost continent of Atlantis.Rosenberg, Alfred, \\"The Myth of the 20th Century\\". The term \\"Atlantis\\" is mentioned two times in the whole book, the term \\"Atlantis- hypothesis\\" is mentioned just once. Rosenberg (page 24): \\"It seems to be not completely impossible, that at parts where today the waves of the Atlantic ocean murmur and icebergs move along, once a blossoming land towered in the water, on which a creative race founded a great culture and sent its children as seafarers and warriors into the world; but if this Atlantis-hypothesis proves untenable, we still have to presume a prehistoric Nordic cultural center.\\" Rosenberg (page 26): \\"The ridiculed hypothesis about a Nordic creative center, which we can call Atlantis – without meaning a sunken island – from where once waves of warriors migrated to all directions as first witnesses of Nordic longing for distant lands to conquer and create, today becomes probable.\\" Original: Es erscheint als nicht ganz ausgeschlossen, dass an Stellen, über die heute die Wellen des Atlantischen Ozeans rauschen und riesige Eisgebirge herziehen, einst ein blühendes Festland aus den Fluten ragte, auf dem eine schöpferische Rasse große, weitausgreifende Kultur erzeugte und ihre Kinder als Seefahrer und Krieger hinaussandte in die Welt; aber selbst wenn sich diese Atlantishypothese als nicht haltbar erweisen sollte, wird ein nordisches vorgeschichtliches Kulturzentrum angenommen werden müssen. ... Und deshalb wird die alte verlachte Hypothese heute Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass von einem nordischen Mittelpunkt der Schöpfung, nennen wir ihn, ohne uns auf die Annahme eines versunkenen atlantischen Erdteils festzulegen, die Atlantis, einst Kriegerschwärme strahlenförmig ausgewandert sind als erste Zeugen des immer wieder sich erneut verkörpernden nordischen Fernwehs, um zu erobern, zu gestalten.\\" According to Nazi racial theory, the term \\"Aryan\\" described the Germanic peoples.Davies, Norman (2006). Europe at War: 1939-1945 : No Simple Victory, p. 167 However, a satisfactory definition of \\"Aryan\\" remained problematic during Nazi Germany.Ehrenreich, Eric (2007). The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution, pp, 9-11 The Nazis considered the purest Aryans to be those that belonged to the \\"Nordic race\\" physical ideal, known as the \\"master race\\" during Nazi Germany. Although the physical ideal of the Nazi racial theorists was typically the tall, fair-haired and light-eyed Nordic individual, such theorists accepted the fact that a considerable variety of hair and eye colour existed within the racial categories they recognised. For example, Adolf Hitler and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the Aryan race under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.\\"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word \\"blond\\" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of \\"blond\\" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of \\"blond\\" aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as members of the Nordic race.\\" Quoted in Grant, 1922, p. 26. In September 1935, the Nazis passed the Nuremberg Laws. All Aryan Reich citizens were required to prove their Aryan ancestry, one way was to obtain an Ahnenpass by providing proof through baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent.Ehrenreich, Eric (2007). The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution, p. 68 In December 1935, the Nazis founded Lebensborn to counteract the falling Aryan birth rates in Germany, and to promote Nazi eugenics.  Usage and adaptation in other languages = In Sanskrit literature  In Sanskrit and related Indo-Aryan languages, ārya means \\"one who does noble deeds; a noble one\\". Āryāvarta (\\"abode of the āryas\\") is a common name for the northern Indian subcontinent in Sanskrit literature. Manusmṛti (2.22) gives the name to \\"the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea\\".The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 14, p. 2 The title ārya was used with various modifications throughout the Indian Subcontinent. Kharavela, the Emperor of Kalinga in second century BCE, is referred to as an ārya in the Hathigumpha inscriptions of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The Gurjara-Pratihara rulers in the 10th century were titled \\"Maharajadhiraja of Āryāvarta\\". Various Indian religions, chiefly Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, use the term ārya as an epithet of honour; a similar usage is found in the name of Arya Samaj. The usage of self-designation Arya was not limited to north India. The south indian emperor of Chola kingdom Rajendra Chola I gives himself the title Aryaputra (son of arya). In Ramayana and Mahabharata, ārya is used as an honorific for many characters including Hanuman. Indo-European language throughout Europe and the Middle East.  In Avesta and Persian literature  Unlike the several meanings connected with ārya- in Old Indo- Aryan, the Old Persian term only has an ethnic meaning.G. Gnoli,\\"Iranic Identity as a Historical Problem: the Beginnings of a National Awareness under the Achaemenians\\", in The East and the Meaning of History.

Online accessed in 2010 at That is in contrast to Indo-Aryan usage, in which several secondary meanings evolved, the meaning of ar- as a self-identifier is preserved in Iranian usage, hence the word \\"Iran\\". The airya meant \\"Iranian\\", and Iranian anairya meant and means \\"non-Iranian\\". Arya may also be found as an ethnonym in Iranian languages, e.g., Alan and Persian Iran and Ossetian Ir/Iron The name is itself equivalent to Aryan, where Iran means \\"land of the Aryans,\\"R. Schmitt, \\"Aryans\\" in Encyclopædia Iranica: Excerpt:\\"The name \\"Aryan\\" (OInd. āˊrya-, Ir. *arya- [with short a-], in Old Pers. ariya-, Av. airiia-, etc.) is the self designation of the peoples of Ancient India and Ancient Iran who spoke Aryan languages, in contrast to the \\"non-Aryan\\" peoples of those \\"Aryan\\" countries (cf.

The Avesta clearly uses airya/airyan as an ethnic name (Vd. 1; Yt. 13.143-44, etc.), where it appears in expressions such as airyāfi; daiŋˊhāvō \\"Iranian lands, peoples\\", airyō.šayanəm \\"land inhabited by Iranians\\", and airyanəm vaējō vaŋhuyāfi; dāityayāfi; \\"Iranian stretch of the good Dāityā\\", the river Oxus, the modern Āmū Daryā. Old Persian sources also use this term for Iranians. Old Persian which is a testament to the antiquity of the Persian language and which is related to most of the languages/dialects spoken in Iran including modern Persian, the Kurdish languages, Balochi, and Gilaki makes it clear that Iranians referred to themselves as Arya. The term \\"Airya/Airyan\\" appears in the royal Old Persian inscriptions in three different contexts: # As the name of the language of the Old Persian version of the inscription of Darius I in Behistun # As the ethnic background of Darius I in inscriptions at Naqsh-e-Rostam and Susa (Dna, Dse) and Xerxes I in the inscription from Persepolis (Xph) # As the definition of the God of the Aryans, Ahura Mazdā, in the Elamite language version of the Behistun inscription. For example in the Dna and Dse Darius and Xerxes describe themselves as \\"An Achaemenian, A Persian son of a Persian and an Aryan, of Aryan stock\\".R.G. Kent. Old Persian. Grammar, texts, lexicon. 2nd ed., New Haven, Conn. Although Darius the Great called his language the Aryan language, modern scholars refer to it as Old Persian because it is the ancestor of modern Persian language.Professor Gilbert Lazard: \\"The language known as New Persian, which usually is called at this period (early Islamic times) by the name of Dari or Parsi-Dari, can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids. Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as Avestan, Parthian, Soghdian, Kurdish, Balochi, Pashto, etc., Old Middle and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in Fars (the true Persian country from the historical point of view) and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran\\" in Lazard, Gilbert 1975, \\"The Rise of the New Persian Language\\" in Frye, R. N., The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, pp. 595–632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The Old Persian and Avestan evidence is confirmed by the Greek sources. Herodotus in his Histories remarks about the Iranian Medes that: \\"These Medes were called anciently by all people Arians; \\" (7.62). In Armenian sources, the Parthians, Medes and Persians are collectively referred to as Aryans.R.W. Thomson. History of Armenians by Moses Khorenat'si. Harvard University Press, 1978. Pg 118, pg 166 Eudemus of Rhodes apud Damascius (Dubitationes et solutiones in Platonis Parmenidem 125 bis) refers to \\"the Magi and all those of Iranian (áreion) lineage\\"; Diodorus Siculus (1.94.2) considers Zoroaster (Zathraustēs) as one of the Arianoi. Strabo, in his Geography, mentions the unity of Medes, Persians, Bactrians and Sogdians: The trilingual inscription erected by Shapur's command gives us a more clear description. The languages used are Parthian, Middle Persian and Greek. In Greek the inscription says: \\"ego ... tou Arianon ethnous despotes eimi\\" which translates to \\"I am the king of the Aryans\\". In the Middle Persian Shapour says: \\"I am the Lord of the EranShahr\\" and in Parthian he says: \\"I am the Lord of AryanShahr\\".MacKenzie D.N.

Wiesbaden, pp 79–92The \\"Aryan\\" Language, Gherardo Gnoli, Instituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente, Roma, 2002 In the post-Islamic era one can still see a clear usage of the term Aryan (Iran) in the work of the 10th-century historian Hamzah al-Isfahani. In his famous book \\"The History of Prophets and Kings\\", al-Isfahani writes, \\"Aryan which is also called Pars is in the middle of these countries and these six countries surround it because the South East is in the hands China, the North of the Turks, the middle South is India, the middle North is Rome, and the South West and the North West is the Sudan and Berber lands\\".Hamza Isfahani, Tarikh Payaambaraan o Shaahaan, translated by Jaf'ar Shu'ar, Tehran: Intishaaraat Amir Kabir, 1988. All this evidence shows that the name arya \\"Iranian\\" was a collective definition, denoting peoples (Geiger, pp. 167 f.; Schmitt, 1978, p. 31) who were aware of belonging to the one ethnic stock, speaking a common language, and having a religious tradition that centered on the cult of Ahura Mazdā. In Iranian languages, the original self-identifier lives on in ethnic names like \\"Alans\\", \\"Iron\\". Similarly, The word Iran is the Persian word for land/place of the Aryan.  In Latin literature  The word Arianus was used to designate Ariana, the area comprising Afghanistan, Iran, North-western India and Pakistan. In 1601, Philemon Holland used 'Arianes' in his translation of the Latin Arianus to designate the inhabitants of Ariana. This was the first use of the form Arian verbatim in the English language.Online Etymology DictionaryRobert K. Barnhart, Chambers Dictionary of Etymology pg. 54 In 1844 James Cowles Prichard first designated both the Indians and the Iranians \\"Arians\\" under the false assumption that the Iranians as well as the Indians self-designated themselves Aria. The Iranians did use the form Airya as a designation for the \\"Aryans,\\" but Prichard had mistaken Aria (deriving from OPer. Haravia) as a designation of the \\"Aryans\\" and associated the Aria with the place-name Ariana (Av. Airyana), the homeland of the Aryans.James Cowles Prichard, Researches Into the Physical History of Mankid, Vol. 4 pg. 33 The form Aria as a designation of the \\"Aryans\\" was, however, only preserved in the language of the Indo-Aryans.  In European languages  The term \\"Aryan\\" came to be used as the term for the newly discovered Indo-European languages, and, by extension, the original speakers of those languages. In the 19th century, \\"language\\" was considered a property of \\"ethnicity\\", and thus the speakers of the Indo-Iranian or Indo-European languages came to be called the \\"Aryan race\\", as contradistinguished from what came to be called the \\"Semitic race\\". By the late 19th century, among some people, the notions of an \\"Aryan race\\" became closely linked to Nordicism, which posited Northern European racial superiority over all other peoples. This \\"master race\\" ideal engendered both the \\"Aryanization\\" programs of Nazi Germany, in which the classification of people as \\"Aryan\\" and \\"non-Aryan\\" was most emphatically directed towards the exclusion of Jews.Under the 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, a non-Aryan was defined as \\"an individual descended from a non-Aryan (in particular Jewish parents or grandparents)\\" (). By the end of World War II, the word 'Aryan' had become associated by many with the racial ideologies and atrocities committed by the Nazis. Western notions of an \\"Aryan race\\" rose to prominence in late-19th- and early-20th- century racialism, an idea most notably embraced by Nazism. The Nazis believed that the \\"Nordic peoples\\" (who were also referred to as the \\"Germanic peoples\\") represent an ideal and \\"pure race\\" that was the purest representation of the original racial stock of those who were then called the Proto-Aryans.Widney, Joseph P. Race Life of the Aryan Peoples New York: Funk & Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--The Old World Volume Two--The New World ISBN B000859S6O See Chapter II—\\"Original Homeland of the Aryan Peoples\\" Pages 9–25—the term \\"Proto-Aryan\\" is used to describe the people today called Proto-Indo-Europeans The Nazi Party declared that the \\"Nordics\\" were the true Aryans because they claimed that they were more \\"pure\\" (less racially mixed) than other people of what were then called the \\"Aryan people\\".Hitler, Adolf Mein Kampf 1925  History = Before the 19th century  While the original meaning of Indo-Iranian *arya as a self-designator is uncontested, the origin of the word (and thus also its original meaning) remains uncertain.There is no shortage of ideas, even in the present day. For a summary of the etymological problems involved, see . Indo-Iranian ar- is a syllable ambiguous in origin, from Indo-European ar-, er-, or or-. No evidence for a Proto-Indo-European (as opposed to Indo-Iranian) ethnic name like \\"Aryan\\" has been found. The word was used by Herodotus in reference to the Iranian Medes whom he describes as the people who \\"were once universally known as Aryans\\". The meaning of 'Aryan' that was adopted into the English language in the late 18th century was the one associated with the technical term used in comparative philology, which in turn had the same meaning as that evident in the very oldest Old Indo-Aryan usage, i.e. as a (self-) identifier of \\"(speakers of) Indo-Aryan languages\\".The context being religious, Max Müller understood this to especially mean \\"the worshipers of the gods of the Brahmans\\". If this is seen from the point of view of the religious poets of the RigVedic hymns, an 'Aryan' was then a person who held the same religious convictions as the poet himself. This idea can then also be found in Iranian texts. This usage was simultaneously influenced by a word that appeared in classical sources (Latin and Greek Ἀριάνης Arianes, e.g. in Pliny 1.133 and Strabo 15.2.1–8), and recognized to be the same as that which appeared in living Iranian languages, where it was a (self-)identifier of the \\"(speakers of) Iranian languages\\". Accordingly, 'Aryan' came to refer to the languages of the Indo-Iranian language group, and by extension, native speakers of those languages.  Avestan  The term Arya is used in ancient Persian language texts, for example in the Behistun inscription from the 5th century BCE, in which the Persian kings Darius the Great and Xerxes are described as \\"Aryans of Aryan stock\\" (arya arya chiça). The inscription also refers to the deity Ahura Mazda as \\"the god of the Aryans\\", and to the ancient Persian language as \\"Aryan\\". In this sense the word seems to have referred to the elite culture of the ancient Iranians, including both linguistic, cultural and religious aspects. The word also has a central place in the Zoroastrian religion in which the \\"Aryan expanse\\" (Airyana Vaejah) is described as the mythical homeland of the Iranian people's and as the center of the world.  Vedic Sanskrit  The term Arya is used 36 times in 34 hymns in the Rigveda. According to Talageri (2000, The Rig Veda. A Historical Analysis) \\"the particular Vedic Aryans of the Rigveda were one section among these Purus, who called themselves Bharatas.\\" Thus it is possible, according to Talageri, that at one point Arya did refer to a specific tribe. While the word may ultimately derive from a tribal name, already in the Rigveda it appears as a religious distinction, separating those who sacrifice \\"properly\\" from those who do not belong to the historical Vedic religion, presaging the usage in later Hinduism where the term comes to denote religious righteousness or piety. In RV 9.63.5, ' \\"noble, pious, righteous\\" is used as contrasting with ' \\"not liberal, envious, hostile\\": :'''' :\\"[the Soma-drops], performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength, driving away the godless ones.\\" (trans. Griffith)  Sanskrit epics  Arya and Anarya are primarily used in the moral sense in the Hindu Epics. People are usually called Arya or Anarya based on their behaviour. Arya is typically one who follows the Dharma. This is historically applicable for any person living anywhere in Bharata Varsha or vast India. According to the Mahabharata, a person's behaviour (not wealth or learning) determines if he can be called an Arya.(Mbh: tasyam samsadi sarvasyam ksatttaram pujayamy aham/ vrttena hi bhavaty aryo na dhanena na vidyaya. 0050880521)Deshpande/ Gomez in Bronkhorst & Deshpande 1999  Religious use  The word ārya is often found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts. In the Indian spiritual context, it can be applied to Rishis or to someone who has mastered the four noble truths and entered upon the spiritual path. According to Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru, the religions of India may be called collectively ārya dharma, a term that includes the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent (e.g. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and possibly Sikhism). = Hinduism = \\"O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a Chandala, is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic literatures many, many times after taking bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Arya family\\" (Bhagavata Purana 3.33.7). \\"My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā according to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called Āryans. Such Āryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.43). According to Swami Vivekananda, \\"A child materially born is not an Arya; the child born in spirituality is an Arya.\\" He further elaborated, referring to the Manu Smriti: \\"Says our great law-giver, Manu, giving the definition of an Arya, 'He is the Arya, who is born through prayer.' Every child not born through prayer is illegitimate, according to the great law-giver: The child must be prayed for. Those children that come with curses, that slip into the world, just in a moment of inadvertence, because that could not be prevented – what can we expect of such progeny?...\\"(Swami Vivekananda, Complete Works vol.8) Swami Dayananda founded a Dharmic organisation Arya Samaj in 1875. Sri Aurobindo published a journal combining nationalism and spiritualism under the title Arya from 1914 to 1921. = Buddhism = The word ārya (Pāli: ariya), in the sense of \\"noble\\" or \\"exalted\\", is very frequently used in Buddhist texts to designate a spiritual warrior or hero, which use this term much more often than Hindu or Jain texts. Buddha's Dharma and Vinaya are the ariyassa dhammavinayo. The Four Noble Truths are called the catvāry āryasatyāni (Sanskrit) or cattāri ariyasaccāni (Pali). The Noble Eightfold Path is called the āryamārga (Sanskrit, also ') or ariyamagga (Pāli). In Buddhist texts, the ārya pudgala (Pali: ariyapuggala, \\"noble person\\") are those who have the Buddhist śīla (Pāli sīla, meaning \\"virtue\\") and who have reached a certain level of spiritual advancement on the Buddhist path, mainly one of the four levels of awakening or in Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva level (bhumi). Those who despise Buddhism are often called \\"anāryas\\". = Jainism = The word ārya is also often used in Jainism, in Jain texts such as the Pannavanasutta.  19th century  In the 19th century, linguists still supposed that the age of a language determined its \\"superiority\\" (because it was assumed to have genealogical purity). Then, based on the assumption that Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-European language, and the (now known to be untenable)Language History, Language Change, and Language Relationship by Hans Henrich Hock, Brian D. Joseph, 2009: \\"Aryan was extended to designate all Indo Europeans, under the false assumption that the Irish word Eire is cognate with ārya; and ill-founded theories about the racial identity of these Aryans... \\", page 57 position that Irish Éire was etymologically related to \\"Aryan\\", in 1837 Adolphe Pictet popularized the idea that the term \\"Aryan\\" could also be applied to the entire Indo-European language family as well. The groundwork for this thought had been laid by Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Zwischen Barbarenklischee und Germanenmythos: eine Analyse österreichischer ... by Elisabeth Monyk (2006), p. 31. In particular, German scholar Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel published in 1819 the first theory linking the Indo-Iranian and the German languages under the Aryan group.Schlegel, Friedrich. 1819. Review of J. G. Rhode, Über den Anfang unserer Geschichte und die letzte Revolution der Erde, Breslau, 1819. Jahrbücher der Literatur VIII: 413ff In 1830 Karl Otfried Müller used \\"Arier\\" in his publications.  Theories of Aryan invasion  Translating the sacred Indian texts of the Rig Veda in the 1840s, German linguist Friedrich Max Muller found what he believed to be evidence of an ancient invasion of India by Hindu Brahmins a group he described as \\"the Arya\\". Muller was careful to note in his later work that he thought Aryan was a linguistic category rather than a racial one. Nevertheless, scholars used Muller's invasion theory to propose their own visions of racial conquest through South Asia and the Indian Ocean. In 1885, the New Zealand polymath Edward Tregear argued that an \\"Aryan tidal-wave\\" had washed over India and continued to push south, through the islands of the East Indian archipelago, reaching the distant shores of New Zealand. Scholars such as John Batchelor, Armand de Quatrefages, and Daniel Brinton extended this invasion theory to the Philippines, Hawaii, and Japan, identifying indigenous peoples who they believed were the descendants of early Aryan conquerors. In the 1850s Arthur de Gobineau supposed that \\"Aryan\\" corresponded to the suggested prehistoric Indo-European culture (1853–1855, Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races). Further, de Gobineau believed that there were three basic races – white, yellow and black – and that everything else was caused by race miscegenation, which de Gobineau argued was the cause of chaos. The \\"master race\\", according to de Gobineau, were the Northern European \\"Aryans\\", who had remained \\"racially pure\\". Southern Europeans (to include Spaniards and Southern Frenchmen), Eastern Europeans, North Africans, Middle Easterners, Iranians, Central Asians, Indians, he all considered racially mixed, degenerated through the miscegenation, and thus less than ideal. By the 1880s a number of linguists and anthropologists argued that the \\"Aryans\\" themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. A specific region began to crystallize when the linguist Karl Penka (Die Herkunft der Arier. Neue Beiträge zur historischen Anthropologie der europäischen Völker, 1886) popularized the idea that the \\"Aryans\\" had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes. The distinguished biologist Thomas Henry Huxley agreed with him, coining the term \\"Xanthochroi\\" to refer to fair-skinned Europeans (as opposed to darker Mediterranean peoples, who Huxley called \\"Melanochroi\\"). Madison Grant's vision of the distribution of \\"Nordics\\" (red), \\"Alpines\\" (green) and \\"Mediterraneans\\" (yellow). William Z. Ripley's map of the \\"cephalic index\\" in Europe, from The Races of Europe (1899). This \\"Nordic race\\" theory gained traction following the publication of Charles Morris's The Aryan Race (1888), which touches racist ideology. A similar rationale was followed by Georges Vacher de Lapouge in his book L'Aryen et son rôle social (1899, \\"The Aryan and his Social Role\\"). To this idea of \\"races\\", Vacher de Lapouge espoused what he termed selectionism, and which had two aims: first, achieving the annihilation of trade unionists, considered \\"degenerate\\"; second, the prevention of labour dissatisfaction through the creation of \\"types\\" of man, each \\"designed\\" for one specific task (See the novel Brave New World for a fictional treatment of this idea). Meanwhile, in India, the British colonial government had followed de Gobineau's arguments along another line, and had fostered the idea of a superior \\"Aryan race\\" that co-opted the Indian caste system in favor of imperial interests. In its fully developed form, the British-mediated interpretation foresaw a segregation of Aryan and non-Aryan along the lines of caste, with the upper castes being \\"Aryan\\" and the lower ones being \\"non- Aryan\\". The European developments not only allowed the British to identify themselves as high-caste, but also allowed the Brahmins to view themselves as on-par with the British. Further, it provoked the reinterpretation of Indian history in racialist and, in opposition, Indian Nationalist terms. In The Secret Doctrine (1888), Helena Petrovna Blavatsky described the \\"Aryan root race\\" as the fifth of seven \\"Root races\\", dating their souls as having begun to incarnate about a million years ago in Atlantis. The Semites were a subdivision of the Aryan root race. \\"The occult doctrine admits of no such divisions as the Aryan and the Semite, ... The Semites, especially the Arabs, are later Aryans — degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality. To these belong all the Jews and the Arabs.\\" The Jews, according to Blavatsky, were a \\"tribe descended from the Tchandalas of India,\\" as they were born of Abraham, which she believed to be a corruption of a word meaning \\"No Brahmin\\". Other sources suggest the origin Avram or Aavram. The name for the Sassanian Empire in Middle Persian is Eran Shahr which means Aryan Empire.Wiesehofer, Joseph Ancient Persia New York:1996 I.B. Tauris In the aftermath of the Islamic conquest in Iran, racialist rhetoric became a literary idiom during the 7th century, i.e., when the Arabs became the primary \\"Other\\" – the anaryas – and the antithesis of everything Iranian (i.e. Aryan) and Zoroastrian. But \\"the antecedents of [present-day] Iranian ultra-nationalism can be traced back to the writings of late nineteenth-century figures such as Mirza Fatali Akhundov and Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani. Demonstrating affinity with Orientalist views of the supremacy of the Aryan peoples and the mediocrity of the Semitic peoples, Iranian nationalist discourse idealized pre-Islamic [Achaemenid and Sassanid] empires, whilst negating the 'Islamization' of Persia by Muslim forces.\\" In the 20th century, different aspects of this idealization of a distant past would be instrumentalized by both the Pahlavi monarchy (In 1967, Iran's Pahlavi dynasty [overthrown in the 1979 Iranian Revolution] added the title Āryāmehr Light of the Aryans to the other styles of the Iranian monarch, the Shah of Iran being already known at that time as the Shahanshah (King of Kings)), and by the Islamic republic that followed it; the Pahlavis used it as a foundation for anticlerical monarchism, and the clerics used it to exalt Iranian values vis-á-vis westernization.  20th century  An intertitle from the silent film blockbuster The Birth of a Nation (1915). \\"Aryan birthright\\" is here \\"white birthright\\", the \\"defense\\" of which unites \\"whites\\" in the Northern and Southern U.S. against \\"coloreds\\". In another film of the same year, The Aryan, William S. Hart's \\"Aryan\\" identity is defined in distinction from other peoples. In the United States, the best-selling 1907 book Race Life of the Aryan Peoples by Joseph Pomeroy Widney consolidated in the popular mind the idea that the word \\"Aryan\\" is the proper identification for \\"all Indo-Europeans\\", and that \\"Aryan Americans\\" of the \\"Aryan race\\" are destined to fulfill America's manifest destiny to form an American Empire.Widney, Joseph P Race Life of the Aryan Peoples New York: Funk & Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--The Old World, Volume Two--The New World ISBN B000859S6O: Race Life of the Aryan Peoples Vol.1--\\"The Old World\\": Race Life of the Aryan Peoples Vol.2--\\"The New World\\": Gordon Childe would later regret it, but the depiction of Aryans as possessors of a \\"superior language\\" became a matter of national pride in learned circles of Germany (portrayed against the background that World War I was lost because Germany had been betrayed from within by miscegenation and the \\"corruption\\" of socialist trade unionists and other \\"degenerates\\"). Alfred Rosenberg—one of the principal architects of Nazi ideological creed—argued for a new \\"religion of the blood\\", based on the supposed innate promptings of the Nordic soul to defend its \\"noble\\" character against racial and cultural degeneration. Under Rosenberg, the theories of Arthur de Gobineau, Georges Vacher de Lapouge, Blavatsky, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Madison Grant, and those of Hitler,Mein Kampf, tr. in The Times, 25 July 1933, p. 15/6 all culminated in Nazi Germany's race policies and the \\"Aryanization\\" decrees of the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s. In its \\"appalling medical model\\", the annihilation of the \\"racially inferior\\" Untermenschen was sanctified as the excision of a diseased organ in an otherwise healthy body, which led to the Holocaust. In academic scholarship, the only surviving use of the word \\"Aryan\\" among many scholars is that of the term \\"Indo-Aryan\\", which indicates \\"(speakers of) languages descended from Prakrits\\". Older usage to mean \\"(speakers of) Indo- Iranian languages\\" has been superseded among some scholars by the term \\"Indo- Iranian\\"; however, \\"Aryan\\" is still used to mean \\"Indo-Iranian\\" by other scholars such as Josef Wiesehofer and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. The 19th- century meaning of \\"Aryan\\" as (native speakers of) Indo-European languages\\" is no longer used by most scholars, but has continued among some scholars such as Colin Renfrew, and among some authors writing for the popular mass market such as H.G. Wells and Poul Anderson. By the end of World War II, the word \\"Aryan\\" among a number of people had lost its Romantic or idealist connotations and was associated by many with Nazi racism instead. By then, the term \\"Indo- Iranian\\" and \\"Indo-European\\" had made most uses of the term \\"Aryan\\" superfluous in the eyes of a number of scholars, and \\"Aryan\\" now survives in most scholarly usage only in the term \\"Indo-Aryan\\" to indicate (speakers of) North Indian languages. It has been asserted by one scholar that Indo-Aryan and Aryan may not be equated and that such an equation is not supported by the historical evidence, though this extreme viewpoint is not widespread. The use of the term to designate speakers of all Indo-European languages in scholarly usage is now regarded by some scholars as an \\"aberration to be avoided.\\" However, some authors writing for popular consumption have continued using the word \\"Aryan\\" for \\"all Indo-Europeans\\" in the tradition of H. G. Wells,Wells, H.G. The Outline of History New York:1920 Doubleday & Co. Chapter 19 The Aryan Speaking Peoples in Pre-Historic Times [Meaning the Proto-Indo-Europeans] Pages 271–285H.G. Wells describes the origin of the Aryans (Proto-Indo Europeans): such as the science fiction author Poul Anderson,See the Poul Anderson short stories in the 1964 collection Time and Stars and the Polesotechnic League stories featuring Nicholas van Rijn and scientists writing for the popular media, such as Colin Renfrew.Renfrew, Colin. (1989). The Origins of Indo-European Languages. /Scientific American/, 261(4), 82–90. In explaining the Anatolian hypothesis, the term \\"Aryan\\" is used to denote \\"all Indo-Europeans\\" Echoes of \\"the 19th century prejudice about 'northern' Aryans who were confronted on Indian soil with black barbarians [...] can still be heard in some modern studies.\\" In a socio-political context, the claim of a white, European Aryan race that includes only people of the Western and not the Eastern branch of the Indo-European peoples is entertained by certain circles, usually representing white nationalists who call for the halting of non-white immigration into Europe and limiting immigration into the United States. They argue that a large intrusion of immigrants can lead to ethnic conflicts such as the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia and the 2005 civil unrest in France. In recent decades, the idea of an Aryan invasion/migration into India has been disputed mainly by Indian scholars, who claim various alternate Indigenous Aryans scenarios contrary to established Kurgan model. However, these alternate scenarios are rooted in traditional and religious views on Indian history and identity and are universally rejected in mainstream scholarship. According to Michael Witzel, the \\"indigenous Aryans\\" position is not scholarship in the usual sense, but an \\"apologetic, ultimately religious undertaking\\":  See also  * Arya (name) * Airyanem Vaejah * Aryavarta * Ariana * Arya samaj * Graeco-Aryan * Mleccha  Notes  References = Bibliography       * . * * Further reading    Category:Etymologies Category:Esoteric anthropogenesis Category:Ancient peoples Category:Indo-Iranian peoples Category:History of Iran Category:History of India Category:Avesta Category:Indo-European linguistics ","title":"Aryan"},{"id":"24558038","text":"Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum is a species of succulent plant in the genus Mesembryanthemum known by the common name slenderleaf iceplant.

It was also a hundred, Poor law union, sanitary district then rural district covering a larger area of south Hampshire, England close to Southampton. These last four South Stoneham divisions covered much of modern-day north Southampton suburbs and the Borough of Eastleigh. The manor house (South Stoneham House) and parish church (St Mary) are in Swaythling. Southampton was a second manor, but took over from South Stoneham as a name in general use. Manor and estate of South Stoneham (990–present) A charter dating from 990 relates to the manor of South Stoneham, and archaeological evidence of a Saxon settlement was found during building works in the area immediately around the current South Stoneham House. The manor of South Stoneham was originally called Bishop's Stoneham, and was held by the Bishop of Winchester at the time of the Domesday Book. Other than St. Mary's Church (which is close to South Stoneham House but predates it considerably) and a few adjacent houses, there was no village of \\"South Stoneham\\"; instead adjoining, as it does today, Swaythling \\"now practically a suburb of Southampton, and [a] favourite residential quarter.\\" which became the generally used name for all the rest of the parish. The tenants of the manor apparently took their name from it; a Gregory de South Stoneham (or Gegory de Stoneham) is recorded there in 1236 and 1249, and in 1315 the manor was held by Nicholas de South Stoneham (son of Guy de South Stoneham). In 1348 Thomas de Stoneham and his wife Alice were lord and lady of the manor, and five heiresses of theirs – possibly daughters – held the manor in 1367. However, that year they quitclaimed it to Adam le Chaundle. The history is somewhat incomplete after that point, but records do exist of the manor being passed from Nicholas Fitz John to William Nicholl in 1436 and from John Langhorn to Thomas Payne in 1478. After Payne's death the manor passed to John Langhorn's son William, and it remained in the Langhorn family until Stephen Langhorn, or Langher, sold it to John Capelyn for £140 in 1553. The Langhorn family's name remains familiar to present-day residents of the Swaythling area due to the presence of Langhorn Road. Capelyn sold the manor to William Conway in 1600, who sold it to Edmund Clerke in 1612; Clerke's son inherited the manor in 1634 but only survived for a further two years, at which point the manor passed to Edmund Clerke's 8½-year-old grandson, another Edmund. This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and clerk to the Signet in 1671. Clerke the younger married the daughter of Giles Frampton, who took control of the manor after Clerke's death and sold it to Edmund Dummer, a former Surveyor of the Navy, in 1705. South Stoneham HouseSouth Stoneham House was constructed in 1708 as the Dummer's family home, and has been attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor. Dummer was from nearby North Stoneham and had been baptised in St. Nicolas' Church there. As of 1915 the grounds of the house comprised 110 acres, with 5 acres of water, and were laid out after 1722 by Capability BrownThe Times, 13 June 1804 (though very little of the original landscaping remains). Edmund Dummer was declared bankrupt in 1711 and he died in debtors' prison two years later. His cousin Thomas, a lawyer who had acquired the manor on Edmund's behalf, fought a lawsuit attempting to gain control of the property; however in 1716, Edward Nicholas of Newton Valence took ownership of South Stoneham. William Sloane, whose brother founded the British Museum, purchased the manor from Nicholas in 1740, and it was subsequently owned by his son Hans Sloane, Jean Louis Bazalgette, and John Lane. Lane was declared bankrupt and the manor was put up for sale in 1815 after which it was bought by John Willis Fleming, who also owned the manor of North Stoneham where a new house was being built for him at North Stoneham Park. When the new North Stoneham House was completed, John Willis Fleming moved there and leased South Stoneham House to General Joseph Gubbins until the general's death in 1832. In 1831 there was a major fire at North Stoneham, and John Willis Fleming returned to live in South Stoneham House again after Gubbins' death while North Stoneham was rebuilt. When this was completed in 1834 South Stoneham House was again advertised to let, and again in 1843. Mrs Charlotte Maria Beckford leased the property and died at South Stoneham House in 1854, after which Thomas Willis Fleming (second son of John) moved in. He purchased the property from his elder brother in 1857 and lived there until 1861. The Willis Flemings sold South Stoneham House for £20,000 in 1875 (or 1878 according to some sources), to Captain Thomas Davison (or Daveson). Included in the sale catalogue issued on 23 November 1875 was Wood Mill (still standing and operating as an outdoor activities centre as of 2013), Gascon Cottage, and land for building. \\"Gascon's Meadow with house thereon in South Stoneham\\" was reconveyanced the next year. In 1888 South Stoneham House was purchased from Davison by Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling. Eleven years later he also purchased Townhill Park House for his son Louis, who continued to live at Townhill after Samuel's death in 1911. By 1915 the estate's grounds consisted of 110 acres, with 5 acres of water, compared to the much larger parish (1,296 acres, 26 of water). South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some two miles to the northwest), in 1920 to house male students at University College Southampton, later to become the University of Southampton, who still own the building as at January 2015. Parish St Mary's Church The original parish of South Stoneham covered over and extended along the eastern side of the River Itchen from the site of the present day Eastleigh in the north to just above Northam Bridge in the south, and from Swaythling to the outskirts of the original town of Southampton on the western side of the river, and, prior to boundary changes in 1891-94, comprised the eight tithings of Allington, Barton, Bitterne, Boyatt, Eastleigh, Pollack, Portswood, and Shamblehurst. Other than the parish church of St Mary and a few adjacent houses, there was no village of \\"South Stoneham\\". In the Domesday Book, the church at South Stoneham was the property of Richer the clerk, \\"who held this, with two dependent churches near Southampton, of the bishop of Winchester\\". Richer (\\"Richerius\\") was also the priest and holder of the benefice of St. Mary's Church at Southampton. The parish was listed as \\"Stanham – Manebrige Hundred – Hantscire\\". By the 16th century, South Stoneham was described as \\"an appropriation of St. Mary's Church, Southampton\\" and both churches were in the gift and under the special jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester. The living at South Stoneham then became the gift of the rector of St. Mary's, Southampton, who held the right of presentation until the early 20th century. In 1851 the parish had a population of 4961. As a result of the expansion of Southampton, the Local Government Act 1894 caused much of the parish of South Stoneham to be incorporated into newly formed neighbouring civil parishes, with the remaining parish covering . However the parish was still extensive, taking in the areas of Bevois Valley, Portswood, Mansbridge and what is now Bitterne Park as well as part of the village of Swaythling (the northern part of the village was in the North Stoneham parish). It also included Allington (now within West End) and Shamblehurst (now in Hedge End). Poor law union (1835–1930)  South Stoneham Workhouse, today better known as Moorgreen Hospital South Stoneham Poor Law Union was formed on 25 March 1835 with nine constituent parishes and overseen by a board of 16 governors. The original nine parishes were Botley, Burlesdon, Chilworth, Hamble, Hound, Milbrook, North Stoneham, St Mary's Extra, and South Stoneham. In 1851 the Union covered an area of 30,715 acres and had a population of 15,974. Following boundary changes in 1894 the parishes of Bitterne, Eastleigh, Hedge End, Itchen, Portswood, Shirley, Sholing and West End were added to the union. Sanitary district (1875–1894) Sanitary districts were established in England and Wales in 1875. In rural districts (as South Stoneham was at the time), they were coterminous with the existing poor law unions. As well as the Rural Sanitary Authority, a South Stoneham Highways Board was established.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=041-34m74&cid;=-1#-1 Rural district (1894–1932) South Stoneham Rural District was established by the Local Government Act 1894, replacing the sanitary authority. The Highways Board continued to meet separately from the new district council. South Stoneham Rural District was divided and merged into other authorities in 1932, one part of it becoming part of Winchester Rural District and the other joining the Southampton Corporation.

Egerton, Military Library, Whitehall. 1813.\\" Jane Austen's (1775–1817) distinctive literary style relies on a combination of parody, burlesque, irony, free indirect speech and a degree of realism. She uses parody and burlesque for comic effect and to critique the portrayal of women in 18th-century sentimental and gothic novels. Austen extends her critique by highlighting social hypocrisy through irony; she often creates an ironic tone through free indirect speech in which the thoughts and words of the characters mix with the voice of the narrator. The degree to which critics believe Austen's characters have psychological depth informs their views regarding her realism. While some scholars argue that Austen falls into a tradition of realism because of her finely executed portrayal of individual characters and her emphasis on \\"the everyday\\", others contend that her characters lack a depth of feeling compared with earlier works, and that this, combined with Austen's polemical tone, places her outside the realist tradition. Often characterized as \\"country house novels\\" or \\"comedies of manners\\", Austen's novels also include fairy tale elements. They have less narrative or scenic description and much more dialogue than other early 19th-century novels. Austen shapes a distinctive and subtly constructed voice for each character. Her plots are fundamentally about education; her heroines come to see themselves and their conduct more clearly, and become better, more moral people. While Austen steers clear of the formal moralizing common in early-19th-century literature, morality—characterized by manners, duty to society and religious seriousness—is a central theme of her works. Throughout her novels, serious reading is associated with intellectual and moral development. The extent to which the novels reflect feminist themes has been extensively debated by scholars; most critics agree that the novels highlight how some female characters take charge of their own worlds, while others are confined, physically and spiritually. Almost all Austen's works explore the precarious economic situation in which women of the late-18th and early-19th centuries found themselves. Austen's novels have variously been described as politically conservative and progressive. For example, one strand of criticism claims that her heroines support the existing social structure through their dedication to duty and sacrifice of their personal desires. Another argues that Austen is sceptical of the paternalistic ruling \\"other\\", evidenced by her ironic tone. Within her exploration of the political issues surrounding the gentry, Austen addresses issues relating to money and property, particularly the arbitrary quality of property inheritance and the precarious economic position of women. Throughout her work there is a tension between the claims of society and the claims of the individual. Austen is often considered one of the originators of the modern, interiorized novel character. Styles=Parody and burlesque In alt=A painting in a yellow and brown palette of a ring of bare tree trunks surrounding a ruined abbey with gravestones on the ground. Austen's juvenile writings are parodies and burlesques of popular 18th-century genres, such as the sentimental novel. She humorously demonstrates that the reversals of social convention common in sentimental novels, such as contempt for parental guidance, are ridiculously impractical; her characters \\"are dead to all common sense\\".Waldron, 17; Litz, 7–14. Her interest in these comedic styles, influenced in part by the writings of novelist Frances Burney and playwrights Richard Sheridan and David Garrick,Grundy, \\"Jane Austen and literary traditions\\", 203; Kirkham, 35; Litz, 14–17. continued less overtly throughout her professional career.Doody, \\"The short fiction\\", 98. Austen's burlesque is characterized by its mocking imitation and its exaggerated, displaced emphasis.Lascelles, 49, 55–72; Fergus, 20. For example, in Northanger Abbey, she ridicules the plot improbabilities and rigid conventions of the Gothic novel.Johnson, 35; see also Litz, 51–53; Fergus, 20–24; Mudrick, 39–40. However, she does not categorically reject the Gothic. As Austen scholar Claudia Johnson argues, Austen pokes fun at the \\"stock gothic machinery—storms, cabinets, curtains, manuscripts—with blithe amusement\\", but she takes the threat of the tyrannical father seriously.Johnson, 35; see also Mudrick, 46–48. Austen uses parody and burlesque not only for comedic effect, but also, according to feminist critics, to reveal how both sentimental and Gothic novels warped the lives of women who attempted to live out the roles depicted in them.Gilbert and Gubar, 119; see also Kirkham, 35. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain in their seminal work, The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), Austen makes fun of \\"such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents\\".Gilbert and Gubar, 151. Irony Irony is one of Austen's most characteristic and most discussed literary techniques.Brownstein, \\"Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice\\", 34; Litz, 107–111; Mudrick 1–3. She contrasts the plain meaning of a statement with the comic, undermining the meaning of the original to create ironic disjunctions. In her juvenile works, she relies upon satire, parody and irony based on incongruity. Her mature novels employ irony to foreground social hypocrisy.Mudrick, 1. In particular Austen uses irony to critique the marriage market.Gilbert and Gubar, 112. Perhaps the most famous example of irony in Austen is the opening line of Pride and Prejudice: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" At first glance, the sentence is straightforward and plausible, but the plot of the novel contradicts it: it is women without fortunes who need husbands and seek them out. By the end of the novel, the truth of the statement is acknowledged only by a single character, Mrs. Bennet, a mother seeking husbands for her daughters.Mandal, \\"Language\\", 29–30; Litz, 107. Austen's irony goes beyond the sentence level. As Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains, \\"the major structural device in Pride and Prejudice is the creation of ironies within the novel's action which, like parallels and contrasts, challenge the reader's attention and judgment throughout, and in the end also engage his feelings.\\"Fergus, 93; see Litz, 107–111 for another discussion of structural irony. Austen's irony illuminates the foibles of individual characters and her society. In her later novels, in particular, she turns her irony \\"against the errors of law, manners and customs, in failing to recognize women as the accountable beings they are, or ought to be\\".Kirkham, 92. Free indirect speech Austen is most renowned for her development of free indirect speech, a technique pioneered by 18th-century novelists Henry Fielding and Frances Burney.Page, 124; Mandal, \\"Language\\", 30–31. In free indirect speech, the thoughts and speech of the characters mix with the voice of the narrator. Austen uses it to provide summaries of conversations or to compress, dramatically or ironically, a character's speech and thoughts.Mandal, \\"Language\\", 30–31; Page, 121. In Sense and Sensibility, Austen experiments extensively for the first time with this technique.Butler, 189-90. For example, As Austen scholar Norman Page explains, \\"the first sentence is straight narrative, in the 'voice' of the [narrator]; the third sentence is normal indirect speech; but the second and fourth are what is usually described as free indirect speech.\\"Page, 122. In these two sentences, Austen represents the inner thoughts of the character and creates the illusion that the reader is entering the character's mind.Lynch, Economy of Character, 237. She often uses indirect speech for background characters. However, Page writes that \\"for Jane Austen ... the supreme virtue of free indirect speech ... [is] that it offers the possibility of achieving something of the vividness of speech without the appearance for a moment of a total silencing of the authorial voice.\\"Page, 134. Conversation and language Compared to other early 19th-century novels, Austen's have little narrative or scenic description—they contain much more dialogue, whether spoken between characters, written as free indirect speech, or represented through letters.Burrows, \\"Style\\", 178; Page, 31. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, which began as an epistolary novel, letters play a decisive role in the protagonist's educationPage, 31. and the opening chapters are theatrical in tone.Page, 114–115; Mandal, \\"Language\\", 28–29; Jenkyns, 1–2; Lascelles, 106–107. Austen's conversations contain many short sentences, question and answer pairs, and rapid exchanges between characters, most memorable perhaps in the witty repartee between Elizabeth and Darcy.Page, 118. This has made Austen's fiction popular in quoted snippets and in books of quotation. Looser, v-xv. Austen grants each of her characters a distinctive and subtly constructed voice: they are carefully distinguished by their speech. For example, Admiral Croft is marked by his naval slang in Persuasion and Mr. Woodhouse is marked by his hypochondriacal language in Emma.Litz, 51–53, Page, 140–147, Lascelles, 88–89. However, it is the misuse of language that most distinguishes Austen's characters. As Page explains, in Sense and Sensibility, for example, the inability of characters such as Lucy Steele to use language properly is a mark of their \\"moral confusion\\".Page, 20–22, 148–52; see also Mandal, \\"Language\\", 24–27, 31–32. In Catharine, or the Bower, Camilla can only speak in fashionable stock phrases which convey no meaning. She is unable to express real feeling, since all of her emotions are mediated through empty hyperbole.Waldron, 23–24. Austen uses conversations about literature in particular to establish an implicit moral frame of reference. In Catharine, or the Bower, for example, Catharine makes moral judgments about Camilla based on her superficial and conventional comments about literature.Butler, 170–172. Realism The extent to which Austen's novels are realistic is vigorously debated by scholars. The lack of physical description in her novels lends them an air of unreality. In Austen novels, as Page notes, there is a \\"conspicuous absence of words referring to physical perception, the world of shape and colour and sensuous response\\".Page, 54–55. Yet, Austen carefully researched the background of her novels, using almanacs and read books to accurately describe the chronology and geography of her fictional worlds. Alastair Duckworth argues that she displays \\"a concern that the novelist should describe things that are really there, that imagination should be limited to an existing order.\\"Duckwork, 32–33; see also Lascelles, 171–173. Austen's prose also repeatedly contains \\"a relatively small number of frequently-used words, mainly epithets and abstract nouns indicating personal qualities—qualities, that is, of character and temperament rather than outward appearance\\".Page, 54–55; see also Lascelles, 89–90. This allows readers to feel as if they know the characters \\"intimately as a mind\\".Page, 56–57. Many scholars view this connection between the reader and character as a mark of realism. For example, Janet Todd writes that \\"Austen creates an illusion of realism in her texts, partly through readerly identification with the characters and partly through rounded characters, who have a history and a memory.\\"Todd, The Cambridge Introduction to Jane Austen, 28. However, there is little agreement regarding the depth of Austen's characters. Butler has argued that Austen is not primarily a realist writer because she is not interested in portraying the psychology of her heroines. Seeing Austen as a polemicist against sensibility, Butler argues that she avoided \\"the sensuous, the irrational, [and] the involuntary types of mental experience because, although she cannot deny their existence, she disapproves of them.\\"Butler, 294–295. At the time Austen was writing, the historical novels of Walter Scott and early realist novels of Maria Edgeworth had already initiated the realist tradition.Kelly, \\"Religion and politics\\", 152. Austen's novels are sometimes seen as an outgrowth of these new genres. In an early review of Emma, Scott himself praised Austen's ability to copy \\"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\\".Scott, 58; Galperin, \\"Austen's Readers\\", 96 However, as Austen scholar William Galperin has argued, Austen could not have participated in 19th-century realism—the realism with which she later became associated—because it had not yet been fully defined. He argues Austen's novels were part of the beginning phases of realism.Galperin, \\"Austen's Readers\\", 91; Galperin, Historical Austen, 19–20. Therefore, instead of seeing Austen as a realist writer, he sees her as a picturesque writer on the cusp of realism. Her attention to detail, probability, and oppositionality, lead him to call her the \\"historian of the everyday\\".Galperin, Historical Austen, 31. John Wiltshire argues that Austen's works may also be distinguished from the realist tradition in their treatment of illness and health. In the realist tradition, good health is taken for granted, as part of the invisible background, and characters who are ill, or injured, or deformed, become prominently visible for that reason. In Austen's works, the issue of health is in the foreground—Emma's good health, Mr. Woodhouse's hypochondria, Fanny Price's \\"physical insecurity.\\" Health (good or bad) is an important part of the characterization of many of Austen's principal characters, and beginning with Mansfield Park becomes a crucial element in the unfolding of her plots. For a woman, health is a commodity, making her more or less appealing to the patriarchal male gaze (e.g. Marianne is more \\"marketable\\" after her illness).Wiltshire, 8–10. Genre Jane Austen famously wrote to her nephew James Edward Austen that his \\"strong, manly, spirited Sketches, full of Variety and Glow\\" would not fit on \\"the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory on which I work with so fine a Brush, as produces little effect after much labour.\\"Letter to J. E. Austen, 16 December 1816. Le Fay, Jane Austen's Letters, p. 323. Austen novels have often been characterized as \\"country house novels\\" or as \\"comedies of manners\\". Comedies of manners are concerned \\"with the relations and intrigues of gentlemen and ladies living in a polished and sophisticated society\\" and the comedy is the result of \\"violations of social conventions and decorum, and relies for its effect in great part on the wit and sparkle of the dialogue.\\"Fergus, 98. However, Austen's novels also have important fairy tale elements to them. Pride and Prejudice follows the traditional Cinderella plot while \\"Persuasion rewrites the Cinderella narrative, as it shifts the fairy tale's emphasis from the heroine's transformation into a beauty to the prince's second look at her face.\\"Lynch, Economy of Character, 219; see also Johnson, 74. However, Fanny, in Mansfield Park, rejects the Prince Charming character and at least one scholar has suggested that in this Austen is signalling \\"a general attack on the dangers of 'fiction'\\".Litz, 129–31. Willoughby cutting off a lock of Marianne's hair in Sense and Sensibility Austen's novels can easily be situated within the 18th-century novel tradition. Austen, like the rest of her family, was a great novel reader. Her letters contain many allusions to contemporary fiction, often to such small details as to show that she was thoroughly familiar with what she read. Austen read and reread novels, even minor ones.Doody, \\"Reading\\", 358. She read widely within the genre, including many works considered mediocre both then and now, but tended to emphasize domestic fiction by women writers, and her own novels contain many references to these works. For example, the phrase \\"pride and prejudice\\" comes from Burney's Cecilia, and the Wickham subplot in Pride and Prejudice is a parody of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones.Doody, \\"Reading\\", 358–62. Austen's early works are often structured around a pair of characters. For example, Sense and Sensibility is a didactic novel based on the contrast between the beliefs and conduct of two heroines, a novel format that was particularly fashionable in the 1790s and exemplified by Edgeworth's Letters of Julia and Caroline and Elizabeth Inchbald's Nature and Art.Butler, 182–183; Litz, 75–81. Because circulating libraries often used catalogues that only listed a novel's name, Austen chose titles that would have resonance for her readers; abstract comparisons like \\"sense and sensibility\\" were part of a moralistic tradition and eponymous heroine names were part of a new romantic novel tradition.Benedict, \\"Sensibility by the Numbers\\", 69–73. Elinor, representing \\"sense\\", and Marianne, representing \\"sensibility\\", articulate a contrast \\"between two modes of perception\\", according to Butler.Butler, 188; Litz, 79. \\"Marianne's way is subjective, intuitive, implying confidence in the natural goodness of human nature when untrammelled by convention. Her view is corrected by the more cautious orthodoxy of Elinor, who mistrusts her own desires, and requires even her reason to seek the support of objective evidence.\\" However, other critics have argued that the contrast between the two characters is not a strict binary. For example, Marianne reasonably discusses propriety and Elinor passionately loves Edward.Johnson, 60–63; see also Waldron, chapter 3. Between 1760 and 1820, conduct books reached the height of their popularity in Britain; one scholar refers to the period as \\"the age of courtesy books for women\\".Qtd in Armstrong, 61. Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description of (most often) the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined \\"proper\\" etiquette.Sutherland, 26; Johnson, 16. Austen's fiction built on and questioned the assumptions of this tradition, reacting against conduct book writers such as Hannah More, John Gregory, and Hester Chapone.Gilbert and Gubar, 116; Armstrong, 144. Beginning with the juvenilia, as early as Catharine, or the Bower, Austen viewed this genre as thoroughly mindless and irrelevant to social realities.Waldron, 18–20. Themes=Education and reading Austen's plots are fundamentally about education; her heroines undergo a \\"process through which they come to see clearly themselves and their conduct\\" and thereby \\"become better people\\".Devlin, 1. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth goes through a process of error, recognition of error, remorse, and determination to do better. She realizes that she was mistaken about both Wickham and Darcy. In examining her mental processes, it dawns on her that she has never been objective about Darcy. She understands that, apart from her stubbornly maintained feelings of antipathy, she has no objective reason to dislike or reject him: Austen's narratives move towards these moments of self-realization, which are the most dramatic and memorable in her novels.Butler, 176; Devlin, 3–4; Litz, 132–143. Austen is also attempting to educate readers, particularly their emotions.Fergus, 3–4. For example, in Sense and Sensibility and the later novels she focuses on eliciting judgment and sympathy.Fergus, 39. Throughout Austen's novels, reading is associated with intellectual and moral development. Not all reading practices result in \\"improvement,\\" however. Those characters who read superficially to accumulate knowledge for the purpose of displaying their grasp of culture (such as Mary Bennet in Pride and Prejudice), or of flaunting their social status, do not benefit from this moral growth. The ideal reader is represented in Elizabeth, who revises her opinion of Darcy by rereading his letter and keeping herself open to reinterpretations of it.Richardson, 402; Armstrong, 138. Morality Morality, characterized by manners, duty to society and religious seriousness, is a central theme of Austen's works. Drawing on the Johnsonian tradition, Austen uses words such as \\"duty\\" and \\"manners\\" consistently throughout her fiction as signifiers of her ethical system. Manners for Austen are not just etiquette, but also a moral code.Mandal, \\"Language\\", 27; Todd, 20; Butler, 296. According to one important interpretation, Austen can be considered a \\"conservative Christian moralist\\"Butler, 162–164. whose view of society was \\"ultimately founded in religious principle\\".Duckworth, 28; see also Kelly, \\"Religion and politics\\", 155. However, Austen's works are unique among her contemporaries in containing few, if any, references to the Bible.Doody, \\"Reading\\", 348. Instead, she often refers to works by moral poets such as William Cowper.Stabler, 48. Yet other critics have pointed out that Mansfield Park can be seen as a challenge to the conservative novels of the 1790s because the character who most closely adheres to the values of piety, filial obedience and modesty, Fanny, is the one most harmed by the failures of conservative ideology.Johnson, 115–116. Austen feared that economic considerations would overcome moral considerations in human conduct; her most amoral characters—Wickham, Mary Crawford, Mr. Elliot—are the most economically motivated.Duckworth, 29–30, 88. Moral improvement in her works is not only for the characters but also for the readers. Her novels are intended to \\"instruct and to refine the emotions along with the perceptions and the moral sense\\".Fergus 3, 39. Believing in a complex moral conscience rather than an innate moral sense, Austen felt that it was necessary to inculcate readers with proper virtues by portraying morally ambiguous characters from which they could learn. Although she and Johnson shared a similar sense of morality, Johnson argued that only one-dimensional characters could instill virtue in readers.Devlin, 55, 68; see also Fergus, 5, 120. Burney and Austen by contrast are both \\"interested in the emotions which make moral action difficult and in the moral principles which complicate emotions\\".Fergus, 70. Religion Critics and commentators have long agreed that Austen was \\"a conscientious and believing churchwoman.\\" MacDonagh, 4; Kelley, 152; Butler, 162, citing Richard Whately, one of Austen's earliest reviewers; Collins, 181–184; Wheeler, \\"Religion\\", Jane Austen in Context, 406, 409–410. References in her remaining letters suggest to Oliver MacDonagh that Austen was an orthodox Anglican, that she conceived of the Anglican church (in patriotic terms) as national in character, and that she was pleased with \\"the increasing religiosity and advance in public morality\\" in England during her lifetime.MacDonagh, 6–7; Kelly, 152; Butler, 162–164 In 1939 Canon Harold Anson argued that \\"Austen's novels are religious not because they contain religious controversy or 'a strong ecclesiastical motif' ... but because they show 'the underlying principles upon which men live their lives and by which they judge the characters of others'.\\" According to Gary Kelly, \\"this has become the dominant view of those critics who find Austen to be a religious novelist.Kelly, 155. Church was a social as well as a religious event. In Emma, for example, the first time the town sees Mr. Elton's wife is at church. (Chris Hammond, 1898) Austen's style was heavily influenced by the language of the King James Version of the Bible and, especially, by the Book of Common Prayer, both of which Austen heard spoken every week all of her life as a part of Anglican services.Doody, \\"Reading\\", 348; Grundy, 195–196; also Jenkyns, 3–4 and Wheeler, 406. According to Isabel Grundy, \\"the almost prehistorical authors of the Old Testament have bequeathed her their rapidity and spareness of narrative, the New Testament writers their remarkable ability to enter the common mind and to conjure an illusion of verisimilitude by means of a single detail ... her taste for brief declarative sentences is something she shares with the gospels.\\"Grundy, 196. However, while Austen's style was heavily influenced by these works, she seems to have decided not to refer in her work directly to the Bible or other sacred works. Doody points out that \\"she is singular among novelists of her age in her refusal to admit references to the Bible, or to biblical characters, scenes or stories.\\"Doody, \\"Reading\\", 348). Critics are uncertain about Austen's relationship to the rising Evangelical movement within the Anglican church of her day. In the first two decades of the 19th century, Evangelicalism became effective as a powerful upper-middle class pressure group supporting reform of abuses and opposing vice. According to Butler, whether or not Austen was sympathetic to Evangelical religion, her works reflect society's growing seriousness of tone and desire for reform. Other critics have taken a more decisive stance on Austen's personal views. For example, both MacDonagh and Waldron argue that she personally disliked the movement.MacDonagh, 6–7; Waldron, 85. Waldron contends that Austen would not have approved of the movement's idealization of behaviour.Waldron, 85. MacDonagh believes that Austen's letters and other private writings suggest that she became more serious religiously as she became older.MacDonagh, 4. Mansfield Park and Persuasion are the novels most often cited as examples of Austen's growing religiosity. For example, Persuasion \\"is subtly different from the laxer, more permissive social atmosphere of the three novels Jane Austen began before 1800.\\"Butler, 163. and contains more frequent references to Providence.Johnson, 163. In Mansfield Park, Fanny stands for spirituality and proper morality. It is she who most clearly characterizes Henry Crawford's affair with Maria in religious terms, in the language of sin, guilt and punishment. She is portrayed as an earnest, strict and struggling Christian, not perfect but trying hard.MacDonagh, 11–12. GenderFeminism= There is intense scholarly debate as to whether Austen's works follow in the tradition of Enlightenment feminists such as Mary Wollstonecraft. Since the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s, the question of to what extent Austen was a feminist writer has been at the forefront of Austen criticism. Scholars have identified two major strains of 18th-century feminism: \\"Tory feminism\\" and \\"Enlightenment feminism\\". Austen has been associated with both. Tory feminism, which includes such writers as Mary Astell and Dorothy Wordsworth, is a tradition of thought which recognized that \\"women were treated as an inferior class in a man's world\\".Butler, xxiii. Writers in this tradition urged women to counter this discrimination through moral and spiritual self-cultivation and charitable service to the family and community. Butler has argued that Austen belongs to the Tory feminist tradition because of her stylistic and thematic affinity to the writings of Maria Edgeworth.Butler, xxxiv–xlii. Moreover, Austen's \\"heroines' subordinate role in the family ... their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation, and self-control\\" are characteristics shared by the heroines of conservative authors such as Jane West and Mary Brunton.Butler, xv–xvi. Enlightenment feminism, which includes such writers as Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft, is a tradition of thought that claims that \\"women share the same moral nature as men, ought to share the same moral status, and exercise the same responsibility for their conduct\\".Qtd from Kirkham in Butler, xxii. Margaret Kirkham has argued that Austen is part of this tradition because, for one, her \\"heroines do not adore or worship their husbands, though they respect and love them. They are not, especially in the later novels, allowed to get married at all until the heroes have provided convincing evidence of appreciating their qualities of mind, and of accepting their power of rational judgement, as well as their good hearts.\\"Kirkham, 31; see also Johnson, 153. Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is an example of such a protagonist.Johnson, 146. Kirkham argues that Austen knew and admired the works of Mary Wollstonecraft, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).Kirkham, 34. Moreover, she and others argue that Austen's novels followed in the tradition of the radical Jacobin novels of the 1790s, which often dealt with feminist issues.See, for example, Johnson, chapter 1. Throughout Austen's fiction, according to feminist critics, female characters comment on male-authored texts and take charge of the creation of their own worlds. In their seminal work The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), noted feminist critics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar argue that the literary world is dominated by men and their stories, and that Austen recognized and critiqued this. The best-known example is from Northanger Abbey, in which the heroine, Catherine, complains that history \\"tells [her] nothing that does not either vex or weary [her]. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all—it is very tiresome\\". Austen's juvenile parody of Oliver Goldsmith's History of England is \\"authored\\" by \\"a partial, prejudiced, and ignorant Historian\\". In such statements, Austen suggests that history is a masculine fiction and of little importance to women.Gilbert and Gubar, 133–134. Feminist critics also focus on the role of the female artist in Austen's fiction. For example, Claudia Johnson views Emma as a powerful heroine, an artist who controls her home, her marriage choice, her community and her money. Emma composes stories for people's lives and thereby represents the figure of the female artist.Johnson, 124–125, 134–136. Despite arguing that Austen's novels have feminist elements, scholars have still noted that women are frequently represented as confined in Austen's novels and that there are few depictions of female authority figures. Women are literally confined in small spacesGilbert and Gubar, 124. but are constrained even more effectively by social factors such as \\"miseducation\\" and \\"financial dependency\\".Gilbert and Gubar, 135; Jenkyns, 143–145, 155–165. Gilbert and Gubar argue that women \\"must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling\\" because \\"they are too vulnerable in the world at large\\".Gilbert and Gubar, 108. For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: \\"We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\\"Johnson, 160. Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, and many of them are \\"oddly and even unnaturally ineffective\\". Instead, they marry authority figures.Butler, xl–xli. As Gilbert and Gubar put it, \\"becoming a woman means relinquishing achievement and accommodating oneself to men and the spaces they provide\\".Gilbert and Gubar, 154. For example, in Persuasion, as Mary and Louisa grow up they lose their independence and become reliant on those around them.Gilbert and Gubar, 177. =Economic position of women= Chris Hammond's illustration, published in 1898, of Mr. Elton's economic considerations of marriage in Emma. Austen's novels explore the precarious economic position of women of the late-18th and early-19th centuries. As Gilbert and Gubar explain, \\"Austen examines the female powerlessness that underlies monetary pressure to marry, the injustice of inheritance laws, the ignorance of women denied formal education, the psychological vulnerability of the heiress or widow, the exploited dependency of the spinster, the boredom of the lady provided with no vocation\\".Gilbert and Gubar, 136. In exploring these issues, she continued the tradition of Burney's novels, particularly Cecilia (1782) and Camilla (1796).Waldron, 38. Worldly marriage is the theme of Austen's unfinished novel, The Watsons, which portrays a female economy in which the odds for marriage heavily favour those young women whose fathers can and will pay a dowry. Physical attractiveness and \\"accomplishments\\" are helpful but insufficient in the absence of adequate funds for a marriage settlement.MacDonagh, 31. After Mr. Watson dies, the family does not have sufficient money for the dowries or support of the four daughters. As historian Oliver MacDonagh writes, \\"[m]atrimony was their only hope of escape from current penury and future ruin or near-ruin. Dowerless, they were pursuing it with varying degrees of ruthlessness.\\"MacDonagh, 28–31; see also Waldron, 38. MacDonagh points out that none of the marriages in Austen's fiction of which she approved was financially imprudent.MacDonagh, 43. For Austen, marriage and children were a girl's natural and best aspiration. She advocated sincere attachment, material prudence and circumspect delay in the choice of a marriage partner. If the appropriate conditions were met, then marriage should follow.MacDonagh, 74–75. Austen realized that women without independent means felt very great pressure to marry someone who could look after them, because otherwise they would be a burden on their families.Collins, 161; Harding, 171–172. The marriage market that she describes is quite detailed and well understood by all concerned. For example, as is explained in Mansfield Park, \\"Miss Maria Ward, 'with only seven thousand pounds', had the good luck to captivate a baronet, 'her uncle, the lawyer, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it'. To indulge in a marriage less lucrative than might have been expected was regarded as 'throwing oneself away', and someone like Mary Crawford, who prided herself on her realism, could not bring herself to do it.\\"Collins, 161. =Sexuality= Austen's depiction of sexuality is muted and indirect. While her depictions of Elizabeth and Darcy in Pride and Prejudice include descriptions of their physical reactions to each other, which was unusual at the time,Johnson, 90. the climactic moments of this and her other novels are presented from a distance.Mudrick, 30–31. Moreover, Austen does not turn her irony on sexual experiences.Mudrick, 111–113. She often refers to the sexual attraction between characters in oblique terms. For example, she writes that Elinor considers the \\"unaccountable bias in favor of beauty\\", which caused an intelligent man to choose a silly wife. This \\"unaccountable bias\\" represents sexual power, the physical attraction of one body to another, \\"everything that cannot be said about the relations between men and women\\".Wiltshire, 56–57. Politics There is no agreement on Austen's political views and it was not until the second half of the 20th century that her novels were viewed as political at all.Kelly, \\"Religion and politics\\", 155. As Gary Kelly explains: Marilyn Butler and Alastair Duckworth have made the case for Austen as a conservative writer. Butler argues that one measure of a conservative writer is \\"whether the plot, broadly, suggests a victim suffering at the hands of society\\". Butler argues that Austen's novels are so structured, and thus conservative. She divides Austen's works into two kinds: stories involving a \\"Heroine who is Right\\" and a spokeswoman for conservative orthodoxy, and stories involving a \\"Heroine who is Wrong\\" who must learn from her mistakes by recognizing them and resolving to do better. In the novels in which the \\"Heroine is Right\\", the same process of error, self-knowledge and resolve to follow reason is present, but in another principal character or characters. The \\"Heroine who is Right\\" helps bring about the change in these other characters.Butler, 165–167. Butler contends that \\"Austen's stress upon her heroines' subordinate role in a family, upon their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation and self-control, were codes shared with other conservative writers, especially women moralists such as Jane West and Mary Brunton. The acquiescent heroine challenges the hero or heroine of novels of the 1790s by reformists such as Bage, Godwin, Holcroft, Hays, and Wollstonecraft, who insist on thinking independently and speaking out.\\" In Sense and Sensibility, for example, Elinor and Marianne represent \\"the view of the nature-nurture dichotomy usually adopted by conservatives\\", that is, \\"on the one hand, Marianne's way is subjective, intuitive, implying confidence in the natural goodness of human nature when untrammelled by convention. Her view is corrected by the more cautious orthodoxy of Elinor, who mistrusts her own desires, and requires even her reason to seek the support of objective evidence.\\"Butler, 188. Duckworth argues that Austen's heroines aim \\"to support and maintain an inherited structure of values and behavior\\", often with an explicit Christian stoicism.Duckworth, 5–9. In his interpretation, Austen's heroines' morality is based in religious principle and duty to society. Austen's novels portray \\"society\\" positively, and her novels end with hero and heroine united in the company of true friends, society \\"reaffirmed around the central union, and the social fragmentation that initially threatened ... reconstituted through individual commitment into a new whole.\\"Duckworth, 26–27. Scholars such as Claudia Johnson argue that Austen is indebted to the political novels of the 1790s and that she is sceptical of the paternalistic ruling order.Johnson, Chapter 1. For example, Johnson argues that Sense and Sensibility is a critique of primogeniture and the arbitrariness of property inheritance. She contends that the novel is not, as it is often assumed to be, \\"a dramatized conduct book patly favoring female prudence over female impetuosity\\".Johnson, 49–50. Johnson concludes that Austen created \\"a progressive middle ground\\" after the blistering political fights of the 1790s.Johnson, 166. Kelly agrees, writing that Austen embraced the \\"hierarchical social structure and constitution of church and state\\" yet also recognized that they needed reform.Kelly, \\"Religion and Politics\\", 153. Jenkyns supports this view: \\"What must be said emphatically is that she does not praise the existing state of society.\\" Jenkyns, 195. He gives as examples such flawed representatives of the status quo as Sir Walter Elliot, Sir Thomas Bertram and Emma Woodhouse's father; Austen's admiration of the Navy as an avenue of social mobility (the Crofts and Captain Wentworth in Persuasion); and her sympathetic portrayal of characters who are \\"in trade\\" or newly risen from it (Bingley and the Gardiners in Pride and Prejudice, the Westons and Frank Churchill in Emma).Jenkyns, 34, 43–44, 153–154, 183–198. Role of colonialism One of the most hotly debated topics in Austen criticism is the role of colonialism in Austen's works. In 1993 Edward Said published Culture and Imperialism, in which he argued that the relationship between the English and the Antigua estates in Mansfield Park represents the relationship between the center and the periphery of the British empire. He argued that \\"England was surveyed, evaluated, made known, whereas 'abroad' was only referred to or shown briefly without the kind of presence or immediacy lavished on London, the countryside, or northern industrial centers such as Manchester or Birmingham.\\"Said, 72. Specifically, \\"Thomas Bertram's slave plantation in Antigua is mysteriously necessary to the poise and the beauty of Mansfield Park, a place described in moral and aesthetic terms\\" but it is rarely mentioned.Said, 59. In response to Said's argument, several alternative theories were proposed. For example, it was argued that the women of Mansfield Park and the slaves in Antigua were similarly disenfranchised and victimized.Ferguson, 118. Others argue that the crucial opposition is not between a center and a periphery, i.e. Mansfield and Antigua, but rather within Mansfield Park itself, between Sir Thomas and Fanny. In this view, the novel is \\"an inquiry into Mansfield's corruption that challenges the ethical basis for its authority both at home and, by implication, overseas\\".Fraiman, 211. Some critics, such as Susan Fraiman, directly challenge Said, arguing that Austen's position as a dispossessed woman gave her an outsider's view of Britain and its empire, arguing that there are anti-imperialist elements in Austen's criticism of provincialiaty.Fraiman, 214–217. Property and class Austen's novels raise and explore a variety of issues relating to money and property and the power they convey.Copeland, \\"Money\\", Jane Austen in Context, 317–318. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, the plot revolves around the problems caused by primogeniture, as the Bennet property is entailed away from the Bennet daughters,McMaster, 119. and Sense and Sensibility questions the arbitrariness of property inheritance when the elderly Mr. Dashwood disinherits one side of his nephew's family because of his affection for a baby on the other.Johnson, 51–52. As Copeland explains, \\"[f]rom the focus of Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey, where the single most significant economic problem for women is the lack of a fortune, Austen's works steadily engage women in more and more complex relationships to the economy. Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion, each in turn, move through an examination of the economy as measure of social morality, as agent of social disruption, [and] as source of national identity\\".Copeland, \\"Money\\", Cambridge Companion, 132. Lyme Hall, part of Lyme Park The novels discuss social status and social position in terms of \\"rank\\", \\"station\\" and \\"degree\\", and not in terms of \\"class\\" in the modern sense. Where the more modern concept of \\"class\\" is determined principally by productivity and income, and connotes conflict, the term \\"rank\\" focused on lineage and connoted harmony, stability and order.Keymer, 387. Austen generally portrays characters in the professional classes, such as the clergy and armed forces, most positively. For example, in Mansfield Park, the heroine marries a clergyman, while in Persuasion, the model marriage is that of Admiral and Mrs. Croft.McMaster, 120–21; Jenkyns, 193–194. Although Austen's novels suggest that characters should be judged by moral standards and not simply by social status, she always specifies their social positions, often (as with the Gardiners in Pride and Prejudice) making it part of the earliest descriptions of a character.McMaster, 125, 129. Austen outlines characters' social connections in detail.Keymer, 388–389; Duckworth, 85–86. In Emma the reader is exposed to a wide spectrum of hierarchical society: the gentry, the near-gentry, professionals, artisans, servants and the undeserving poor.Aristocrats are absent; MacDonagh, 131–134. While social contact between these groups is frequent in a small village, transition between groups was uncommon. For example, Emma, a member of the gentry, dines with the Coles, \\"rising\\" members of the near-gentry, but she marries Knightley, a member of the gentry, who feels free to dine with Robert Martin, one of his tenant farmers.MacDonagh, 134–135. In his influential analysis of the role of landed estates in Austen's fiction, Duckworth argues that \\"estates function not only as the settings of action but as indexes to the character and social responsibility of their owners\\".Duckworth, 38–39. Landscape improvements appear as an issue in all of the novels, but in Mansfield Park they become a recurring motif, reflecting the social change at the center of the novel.Duckworth, 39. In Pride and Prejudice, it is seeing Pemberley for the first time that sparks Elizabeth's love for Darcy. Duckworth writes that \\"when Elizabeth comes to exclaim to herself that 'to be mistress of Pemberley might be something' she has, we might conjecture, come to recognize not merely the money and status of Pemberley, but its value as the setting of a traditional social and ethical orientation, its possibilities ... as a context for her responsible social activity.\\"Duckworth, 124. Individual and society After being rejected by Willoughby, Marianne is consumed by a fever, as are many heroines of sensibility. (Chris Hammond, 1899) Throughout Austen's work there is a tension between the claims of society and the claims of the individual.Litz, 117–118; see also Duckworth, 37–38. There are two major scholarly traditions in this area. Some critics, such as Reginald Ferrar, D. W. Harding and Marvin Mudrick, have argued that Austen's style is detached; her work is ironically distanced and subtly subverts the prevailing values of her society.Harding, 166–168; Mudrick, 1; Duckworth, 5–9. Her novels, partly through their use of free indirect speech, are part of the development of individualism and individual consciousness, represented in the history of the novel through works by authors such as Samuel Richardson, whose \\"fascination with inner life\\" influenced Austen.Wiltshire, 21–22; Stabler, 44–45; see also Butler, 189–190. In her influential book Desire and Domestic Fiction (1987), Nancy Armstrong argued that the modern individual self is a construct of late-18th and early-19th-century domestic fiction. According to Armstrong, \\"written representations of the self allowed the modern individual to become an economic and psychological reality\\".Armstrong, 8. Perhaps her most important point is that subjectivity is constituted through language, specifically the printed word.Armstrong, 25. In the section of her book devoted to Austen, Armstrong compares and contrasts Emma with Richardson's Pamela and contends that the novel demonstrates the power of language to construct and deconstruct communities and selves.Armstrong, chapter 3. As Wiltshire has observed, \\"middle class\\" British society in Austen's time placed a premium on outward decorum, manners and the limitation of emotional distress to \\"private\\" life. In Austen's novels, the reader is aware that a character is suffering psychological stress or disturbance, but the other characters are aware only of physical symptoms and complaints. The body becomes a place of social tension in these novels.Wiltshire, 22. For example, Mrs. Bennet continually refers to her \\"poor nerves\\", a bodily affliction which it was appropriate to discuss. Her obvious emotional frustrations were not an appropriate topic, as the notion of the private, individualized self developed.Wiltshire, 21–22. Other critics, such as Duckworth, contend that Austen's heroines \\"support and maintain an inherited structure of values and behavior\\", displaying a version of Christian stoicism. He emphasizes that Austen's novels highlight the dangers of individualism; her heroines emerge from isolation and despair to be reinstated into society.Duckworth, 5–9; see also Poovey, 208. In Mansfield Park, in particular, the morally suspect characters—the Crawfords, Rushworth and the Bertram daughters—represent individualism.Duckworth, 37–38. The heroine of Emma embodies the dangers of individualism as her position of power allows her to affect everyone in Highbury.Duckworth, 147–148; Poovey, 224. In Sense and Sensibility, Austen juxtaposes Elinor, who regulates the expression of her feelings according to social conventions, with Marianne, who expresses her feelings in accordance with sensibility and literary conventions. The novel suggests that Elinor's behaviour \\"is based on a truer perception of the nature of emotions\\" than Marianne's, even though it is based on social convention, because those very conventions allow her to process emotions like grief, while sensibility forces Marianne to indulge it.Fergus, 51. By following social conventions, Elinor is more sensitive to the feelings of those around her; her emotions bring \\"together private and public experience, or one's relations with oneself and with others\\".Fergus, 51; see also Butler, 188, and Duckworth 109–113. Individual romantic experience is less important than the social good that comes of Elinor's self-denial; however, that very self-denial leads to personal happiness in the end when she marries her love.Poovey, 193. As Lynch explains, \\"[a]s a whole Austen's writing is about social relations—the relationship between, say, domestic life and public life—and about reading relations—about the textual conventions by which audiences are formed and distinguished. Her narratives weave together the processes of romantic choice and cultural discrimination.\\"Lynch, 216. Austen's heroines often incur a cost to themselves during this social integration. Feminist critics have highlighted the ways in which her heroines accommodate themselves to masculine power by sacrificing their own creativity. Elizabeth and Emma search for replacement father figures in ways that suggest \\"why female survival depends on gaining male approval and protection\\". These father figures, who are often also mentors, show Austen's connection to the 18th-century novel, which includes many such figures.Devlin, 16. Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen's heroines often have a fragmented self—the private and the public—pointing to Mansfield Park as the most dramatic example.Gilbert and Gubar, 163.

It was built between 1898 and 1900 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It was last mill in Ashton to cease spinning. It was spinning artificial fibres in 1987, and was demolished in 1994; the site is now a housing estate. Location Atlas mill was built next to Rock Mill which had been built site of the former Wilshaw Mill, on the junction of Oldham Road and Wilshaw Lane. This had been an unusual site for a mill as it was not close to railways or canals. The water needed to supply the steam engine at Wilshaw Mill came from a reservoir formed by damming the Smallshaw Brook. The reservoir was enlarged when Rock Mill was built. History The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. In 1891, they built Rock Mill. Then 1898, the syndicate registered the Atlas Mill Co. Ltd, with a capital of £70,000 (£ as of ) to build the Atlas Mill. This was their third mill. The syndicate went on to build Curzon Mill, Tudor Mill, Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. On 7 January 1921 all the syndicate's mills went into voluntary liquidation and were passed to the Atlas Mills Ltd group.London Gazette 7th Dec 1920 Atlas Mill was their headquarters. They were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Atlas Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950, where it produced 60 to 100 count mule twist. It closed in 1994 and the site is now a housing estate, part of which was built a number of years before Atlas Mill's closure and was distinguished by a campaign of noise complaint about an establishment of 90 years standing. The roads bear the names Watermill Court and Cedar Mews which gives some indication of their antecedents but will mislead historians about contemporary attitudes. Architecture This was a Sydney Stott building. It was four storeys high built on a basement from engineering brick. The large windows were in groups of three, and there was yellow brick decoration. It had a Hotel-de-Ville style water tower. The six bay engine house, boiler house and chimney were to the north. Power The steam engine was by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw. Usage Atlas Mill was used for spinning fine counts of twists and weft from Egyptian cotton. In 1951 it was spinning Egyptian yarns of counts 60 to 100, using both ring and twist spindles. In 1987 it was spinning & winding artificial fibres. The latter utilised advanced German designed Schlafhorst Winding Machinery but as late as 1982 Mather & Platt 1897 winding frames were still used as backup. This can be seen as admirable frugality or as a sign of the make do and mend and lack of investment that resulted in the closure of the Northern Spinning Division.

Jensen Arctic Museum was a museum focused on the culture and environment of the Arctic in Monmouth in the U.S. state of Oregon. Located on the campus of Western Oregon University (WOU), the museum opened in 1985 with 3,000 artifacts collected by its late founder and namesake. The museum housed 5,000 artifacts and had exhibits on the wildlife of the Arctic along with displays that demonstrate the culture of the Inuit and Eskimo peoples of Alaska. The museum was one of only two museums focused on life in the Arctic located in the lower 48 states, and the only one on the West Coast. In 2013, WOU announced that the Jensen Museum would close its doors and the collections would move to the Museum of Natural and Cultural History (MNCH) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, which also has substantial Arctic collections. History Jensen Arctic Museum was founded in June 1985 by Paul Jensen with artifacts he collected from Alaska. The artifacts were collected over 25 years while he was a researcher and teacher, with most items in the collection coming from gifts from native Alaskans. Jensen, a then retired professor at Western Oregon, served as the curator and director of the museum until his death in 1994. By 1993 the collection had grown to 3,000 artifacts and the museum had 7,000 visitors annually. To celebrate the ten-year anniversary in 1995, the museum held a party featuring traditional Eskimo dancers. The museum received $5,000 in a federal grant in 1997 to allow it to improve its preservation of artifacts. In January 2005, the museum sponsored the Whale in Science and Culture Symposium which featured speakers from the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's former president John V. Byrne among others. Each year the museum hosted a traditional salmon bake as a fundraiser, with 300 pounds of salmon cooked each year. The 28th annual salmon bake was held in 2013, when it was announced that the museum collection would move to the MNCH at the University of Oregon, the official repository for anthropological collections owned by the state of Oregon. Jon Erlandson, director of the MNCH, said that Arctic cultures and environments are rapidly changing and that the Jensen Arctic Collection holds priceless records of those changes that will be used for a variety of research and public education purposes. Collections William L. Iggiagruk Hensley visits the Jensen Arctic Museum and poses with an employee. Focused on the culture of the Inuit and Eskimos of Alaska, the museum housed over 5,000 artifacts in a former home on the campus of Western Oregon University in Monmouth. Included among the artifacts are items that demonstrate the natural environment of these native Alaskans. To showcase the environment, the museum had a room dedicated to Arctic wildlife. This life-sized diorama is called the Circumpolar Room and had an automated system that provides a narrative on the animals of the Arctic while lights illuminate busts of these animals. Animals on display included musk ox, wolves, Arctic fox, a polar bear, brown bears, a snowy owl, and caribou. An extraordinary feature of the Jensen collection is a umiak, an Inuit boat with a frame constructed of driftwood and covered with walrus skins. This boat was given to Jensen by those inhabiting St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, and he used the boat to circle the island during a native hunt. Other large items include a traditional Inuit home constructed of stones, hides, whalebone, and driftwood as well as an long sled and a sod house. The museum included displays that demonstrate the daily lives of the Inuit and Eskimos, primarily the Inupiaq and Yupik Eskimos. These included exhibits on the clothing and artwork. Artifacts include ivory carvings, parkas, jackets made of seal, wolf, and bear skins, a yo-yo-type children's toy, and an anchor made from a whalebone. Other items in the collection include ropes, ivory from mammoth and mastodon tusks, animal bones, ceremonial masks carved from wood or bone, wooden dolls, mukluks, combs carved from ivory, knives, and harpoon heads among others. There is also a dog sled, kayak, snowshoes, baskets, and toys along with artwork. Artwork consists of drawings on sealskins using ink, with some pieces dating to the 1930s. Namesake The museum was named after the founder, Paul Henry Jensen, an immigrant from Denmark, who as a child in Denmark had several classmates who were Inuit. Jensen was born on August 17, 1907, in Teestrup, Denmark, and immigrated to Canada in 1925, only to return in 1927. He served seven months in the army as required by law before immigrating to the United States in 1928. Jensen landed at Ellis Island in 1928 and then moved to Montana before starting college first at Spokane College in Washington State. In 1935, he graduated from Midland College in Nebraska with a bachelor's degree, followed by a doctorate in 1938 from the University of North Dakota. He married Arlene Munkres and they had two sons and three daughters. After some graduate work at the University of Washington and Oregon State University, Jensen began field work in the Arctic. Beginning in 1962, he worked to improve the cultural resources of the Eskimo, bringing over 3,000 people to Oregon as well establishing seven libraries in Alaskan villages. In all he spent over 30 years teaching Eskimo children in Alaska. In 1966, he was hired at Western Oregon State College (now Western Oregon University) as a researcher, and in 1968 became a professor at the school. Jensen retired from teaching in 1979. For his work with native Alaskans, he was named as an honorary member of the Alaska Council of Elders in 1984. To the Eskimos he was known as Angyalik, which translates as captain of the ship. The next year he founded the museum with his artifacts and served as curator and director until he died on September 26, 1994.

The County Championship is an annual first-class cricket league competition for county cricket clubs in England and Wales. The league is contested on a round-robin basis and the championship awarded to the team that is top of the league at the end of the season. Essex County Cricket Club are the current champions, claiming the title in the 2019 season. The first references to county cricket come during the early 18th century, during which time cricket was played almost exclusively in the south-east of England, with teams representing Kent, Middlesex, London and Surrey frequently playing each other.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 31. The sport soon became popular through the rest of the country, and by the end of the 18th century, the game was being played nationwide.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 33. In 1744, Kent faced \\"All England\\" and became the first notional English cricket champions, winning by one wicket.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 34. Cricket was played at both club and county level equally through the next hundred years, and it was only in the 1870s that county cricket started to be played frequently and regularly: in 1870 there were 22 regular fixtures, while ten years later there were 188.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 177. The title of \\"Champion County\\" was awarded intermittently and unreliably from 1826, with no team other than Kent, Surrey or Sussex being named champions until 1852. Qualification rules were introduced in 1873, and for a long time this was considered the start of the County Championship, but the \\"Champion County\\" continued to be inconsistently awarded as late as 1886, when Cricket Magazine named Surrey champions, while most other publications agreed upon Nottinghamshire. After a meeting of the principal clubs' secretaries in 1889, a method of ranking the teams was agreed upon, and the 1890 season is considered the first official competing of the County Championship. The inaugural winners of the competition were Surrey, who won nine of their fourteen matches. The championship grew rapidly in its infancy, and had doubled to have 16 member clubs by 1905. Glamorgan joined in 1921, becoming the only non-English county to compete, and Durham became the most recent addition, entering in 1992. Surrey and Yorkshire each won six of the first thirteen championships, but thereafter the champions diversified, with all but two of the founding member clubs winning by the outbreak of World War I. Yorkshire dominated the competition between the wars, winning in 12 of the 21 seasons. Long periods of dominance continued after World War II: Surrey were champions seven years running during the 1950s, and Yorkshire then won seven of the following ten championships. Since then no county has managed to achieve the same level of ascendancy. In 2000, the competition was split into two divisions, with the winner of Division One being named as County Champions, a decision endorsed by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack editor Graeme Wright, due to there being \\"fewer meaningless matches\\". Yorkshire hold the record for most championships, with 32, plus a shared win in 1949. The next most successful teams are the two London clubs, Surrey and Middlesex, with 19 (plus one shared) and 11 (plus two shared) titles respectively. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the competition was not held in 2020. Essex won the substitute first-class competition, the Bob Willis Trophy.

It was one of the first light aircraft to use a tricycle undercarriage. Despite a sales campaign in the UK, only six were built, one being briefly tested by the RAF. A single example of a flying boat version, one of the smallest of this class, was also built. Design and development In 1935 the Dutch dockyard NV Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde, based at Vlissingen (Flushing) on the Schelde (Scheldt) estuary moved into aircraft manufacture with the acquisition of the staff of the Pander Company. Under their designer Theodor E. Slot, de Schelde produced several different aircraft, the second of which was the Scheldemusch. In pre-war Dutch \\"musch\\" translated to English as \\"sparrow\\", though modern Dutch would use \\"mus\\" and the name sometimes appears as Scheldemus. It was also sometimes anglicized to Scheldt Sparrow. The unconventional appearance of the pusher biplane Scheldemusch, with its then novel tricycle undercarriage, was the result of the intention to produce a novice's aircraft, easy and forgiving to fly and to land. The Scheldemusch was a single-bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span and equal, constant chord. They were built from twin wooden spars, plywood covered in the vulnerable regions of the leading edge and the underside between the N-form interplane struts. The remaining areas were fabric covered. Both wings had pronounced dihedral; the upper one carried ailerons and leading edge Handley Page slots. There was no fuselage in the conventional sense, rather a nacelle for pilot and engine and a number of rearward booms to carry the tail. 'Flight 20 May 1937 The nacelle was flat sided and just wide enough to accommodate the pilot, who sat under flexible glazing below the leading edge of the upper wing. It was a steel-framed, fabric-covered structure. The nose of the aircraft was easily removable to give access to the rear of the instrument panel. 'Flight 20 May 1937 Behind the pilot was a small baggage hold, externally accessed and the 40 hp (30 kW) Praga B2 two-cylinder engine was at the rear of the nacelle, driving a two- bladed pusher propeller with its boss only just below the upper wing. Two horizontal steel booms converged from that wing, just inboard of the interplane struts to the tips of the tailplane. Three more beams spread out from the base of the nacelle upwards, the outer pair joining those from the upper wing forming the tailplane extremities and the central one supporting the rudder and inner tailplane. Thus the tailplane had angular tips and a straight leading edge, and the elevators had a triangular cut out for rudder movement. Because of the short length of these booms the fin and rudder, both of which extended above and below the tailplane had to be generous in area. The tail surfaces were fabric covered over a wooden structure. The main undercarriage was mounted on splayed, sprung and faired legs attached to the rear of the nacelle plus vertical long stroke shock absorbers. The steerable nosewheel had the same diameter as the main wheels. The first prototype, registered PH-ALB, first flew in November 1935.Bernard Klein collection In all, six were built over the next two years but despite good reviews the hoped for sales did not happen. de Schelte sold licence build rights in the UK to Aircraft Constructions Ltd of Sidcup, but demonstrator PH-AM was lost in a crash whilst demonstrating at Gravesend at the start of a sales tour in March 1937. 'Flight 11 March 1937 p.241 One other Scheldemusch was lost in an accident in 1937 and three more were destroyed during the occupation of the Netherlands by Germany in World War II. The only Scheldemusch to survive the war was PH-AMG, which had gone to England as a replacement demonstrator. It was briefly considered by the RAF, appearing with both roundels and its Dutch civil registration.RAF 'musch At the end of the war it was advertised for sale at £235 'Flight 31 December 1977 and there were reports that it survived until 1960, but there is no evidence that it flew in that time. The Scheldemeeuw variants Not long after building the Scheldemusch prototype, de Schelde also brought out a flying boat version called the Scheldemeeuw (meeuw = gull). Wings, empennage and much of the rest of the aircraft was the same as the Scheldemusch. The fuselage was necessarily different, with the nacelle replaced with a wooden structured and plywood-skinned, single-step hull which extended rearwards almost to the tail. The longer fuselage made the attachment of the tail rather easier, three steel wires replacing the lower triplet of booms. The engine mounting and pilot's cockpit were little changed, though the flexible glazing was replaced with flat upright and more robust glass panels There were small floats fixed directly onto the underside of the lower wings for stability on water. Performance was similar to that of the Scheldemusch. This, too failed to sell and in 1938 the sole example PH-ALK was fitted with a new, metal hull and re-registered as PH-ATM.metal hull This was done to provide De Schelde with experience in building metal hull, as they were tooling up to licence build the Dornier Do.24K for the Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service.

It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, is operated by the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, a Catholic jurisdiction of the Order of Saint Augustine, and is a member of the Augustinian Secondary Education Association. The school is named for Rita of Cascia (1381–1457), an Italian Augustinian nun and Roman Catholic saint. History The high school was founded in 1905 by Augustinian friar James F. Green, O.S.A, who bought the property on which the original school sat for US$30,000 for the site. Green Hall was the initial building on the original campus. The school was formally dedicated on 22 April 1906, at which time the San Francisco earthquake of four days earlier was invoked. Successor to the founder was William L. Egan, O.S.A., during whose tenure the original Harris Gym and Egan Hall were completed. In 1922, the school's first stadium was constructed. Joseph B. Kepperling, O.S.A. followed Egan in 1926, but his career was brought to a close by his death in 1929. John J. Harris, O.S.A. was selected as the next rector of St. Rita. In January 1935, a fire caused extensive damage to the school's shrine after an altar candle was placed too close to a Christmas tree. In the summer of 1935, Ruellan P. Fink, O.S.A. succeeded Harris. Under Fink's leadership, technical coursework began at the school in 1936. This period also saw the construction of the Mendel Technical Building (1938), and an addition to Egan Hall (1939), which (at the time) made St. Rita the largest all-boys Catholic school in the American Midwest. A fire destroyed the wooden stands in the athletic stadium in 1944, and were soon replaced with concrete bleachers. An April 1939 benefit for the addition included actors Arthur Treacher, Fifi d'Orsay, Eddie Bracken, and Virginia Payne. The new monastery was completed in 1949. John E. McLaughlin, O.S.A. succeeded Fink in 1956 as principal. In 1962 Francis P. Crawford, O.S.A. became Principal. Crawford was succeeded in 1968 by Daniel B. Trusch, O.S.A. In 1971 LaVern J. Flach, O.S.A. became principal; in 1979 David L. Brecht, O.S.A., in 1983 Patrick E. Murphy, O.S.A. became Principal and in 1989 Bernard R. Danber, O.S.A. was appointed principal. Both Murphy and Danber are graduates of the school. In 1990 the St. Rita Campus moved from 63rd and Claremont Avenue to its current location at 7740 S. Western Avenue. Prior to St. Rita's renting of the new campus, it had been home to another Catholic high school, Quigley Seminary South High School. The Archdiocese of Chicago closed Quigley South prior to St. Rita's purchase of the property, returning the Chicago minor seminary to its original site at Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary. At the time of the move, St. Rita had been preparing a renovation, but was forced to move when there was a concern over a new school opening on the property. The school's then principal stated: \\"We could not afford to let another high school open there. We felt that that would be such a threat to us that we would be in danger of closing.\\" The original campus was sold to the Chicago Board of Education for US$1.8 million. The original campus is now the site of Claremont Academy Elementary School. In 1993 a new president-principal model was adopted for the school. Michael J. O'Connor, O.S.A. became the school's first president. O'Connor appointed Joseph F. Bamberger as principal. In the year 2000 Thomas McCarthy O.S.A. was then named the second president and the first alumnus to be president of St. Rita High School. In the spring of 2002 McCarthy became President-Principal after Joseph F. Bamberger retired. In 2007, Sally Deenihan became not only the twelfth principal in the school's history, but also its first female principal. In 2012, the school announced that Ernest Mrozek would be the new high school President, a position he still holds today. Father Thomas McCarthy, O.S.A., continued to serve as both the Chairman and the Chaplain of the school; he also focused on his new position for the Augustinian Order's new Director of Vocations. School crest The colors which predominate the school crest are red and blue, as these are the school colors. The book and the burning and pierced heart are symbols associated with Saint Augustine. The rose and bees are symbols associated with Saint Rita of Cascia. Academics Students are placed into one of three academic programs, based on an entrance exam score, and input from parents and previous teachers. The Augustinian Academy is for gifted students, the Mendel Academic Program is a college preparatory program, and the Villanova Academic Study Center is geared toward students requiring more individual academic attention. As a part of the Augustinian Academy program, the school offers 12 Advanced Placement courses: 2-D Design, Studio Drawing, Calculus, Chemistry, English, Latin, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, U.S. History, World History. Student life=Activities The school sponsors 14 extracurricular activities ranging from academic competition and publishing to student government, and performing arts. The school's music program supports four organizations, three of which are a marching band, a concert band, and a jazz band. There is also a dance and twirling squad (the Ritanettes), made up of girls from local girls' Catholic High schools, which performs with the marching band and at performances in the winter. Athletics St. Rita competes in the Chicago Catholic League (CCL). St. Rita was one of the eight founding members of the league in 1912, and one of five remaining charter members. The school is also a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), the organization which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state. The school sponsors 12 interscholastic athletics teams which compete in IHSA sponsored state championship tournaments. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school also sponsors interscholastic teams in ice hockey, and rugby. St. Rita has won IHSA State Championships in football (1978–79, 2006–07) and wrestling (2002–03, 2003–04). St. Rita has participated in eight Prep Bowls, the annual (since 1934) game pitting top teams from the Chicago Public League and the Chicago Catholic League. St. Rita won the game in 1963, 1970, 1971, 1977, 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2018. The 1963 football team won the national championship. In 1924, the school's football team hosted an intramural team from The University of Notre Dame coached by Knute Rockne, losing 6–0. Because Quigley South did not have a football team, there was no football stadium at the new school building. St. Rita used its old stadium until the end of September 1990 by which time the conversion of Quigley South's soccer field to a football stadium was completed. The original football stadium at 63rd and Claremont was used in the beginning of the movie Rudy.

Intelsat 15 was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, on a Star-2.4. It is located at 85° E longitude on the geostationary orbit. It was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome to a geosynchronous transfer orbit on 30 November 2009 by a Zenit-3SLB launch vehicle. It has 22 active Ku band transponders, plus eight spares. Five of those transponders are owned and operated by SKY Perfect JSAT Group under the name JCSAT-85. Satellite description Intelsat 15 is a 3 axis stabilized geostationary communications satellite based on the Star-2.4 satellite bus. It weighted at launch, had a dry mass of , and a design life 15 years. It had a power availability dedicated to the payload of 4.6 kW, due to its Multi-junction GaAs solar cells. It also had two 4840 watt hour Li-ion batteries for surviving the solar eclipses. The satellite used a bipropellant propulsion system with an IHI BT-4 Liquid Apogee Engine for orbit circularization and thrusters and reaction wheels for station keeping and attitude control. It was filled with enough propellant for 15 years, but due to the efficient launch and transfer 17 are expected. Its payload is composed two deployable dual grid reflectors, plus one deck mounted reflector. They are fed by 22 active Ku band transponders, plus eight spares. Intelsat uses 17 transponders, which have a bandwidth of twenty 36 MHz transponder equivalents. Its footprint is arranged in a Russia beam and a Middle East beam. SKY Perfect JSAT Group owns five physical transponders under the name JCSAT-85, four have a bandwidth of 36 MHz and the other one has 72 MHz. JSCAT-85 footprint is arranged in two beams, West IOR Beam, covering middle East and the Arabic Sea, and East IOR Beam, covering the Eastern Asia coast and Pacific Ocean.  History  On April 2, 2007, JSAT Corporation (now SKY Perfect JSAT Group) announced an agreement to purchase a payload consisting of five transponders on the yet to be built Intelsat 15. Intelsat and JSAT had already collaborated on the Horizons-1 and Horizons-2 satellites. The satellite, also known as IS-15, would provide services to the Asia-Pacific, Indian Ocean and Middle East regions from the 85°E longitude on the geostationary orbit, where it would replace Intelsat 709. It would have 22 Ku band transponders in total and a design life of 15 years. The JSAT payload would be known as JCSAT-85. On May 1, 2007, Orbital Sciences Corporation (now Orbital ATK) announced that it had been awarded a contract to manufacture Intelsat 15. It would be based on the STAR-2 satellite bus, generate 4.6 kW of power for its 22-transponder Ku band payload and had an expected launch date of early 2009. On February 26, 2008, Sea Launch announce a contract with Intelsat to launch two satellites manufactured by Orbital Corporation, Intelsat 15 and Intelsat 16. The contract was itself a renegotiation for repurpose two already existing reservation by Intelsat with Sea Launch for two satellites to these new spacecrafts. They were expected to be launched by the Land Launch service, which used Zenit-3SLB rockets from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, during 2009. Between October 27 and November 5, 2009 Intelsat 15 was processed in the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On November 6, it was filled with propellant. On November 24, 2009, JSAT announced that the launch of Intelsat 15 was expected on November 29 at 1:00 UTC. But during the launch attempt on November 29, the automatic prelaunch issued an abort command. But the launch committee agreed to make a second attempt on the next day. On November 30, 2009, at 21:00 UTC, the Zenit-3SLB successfully launched Intelsat 15, from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45. After a six and a half hour mission, the DM-3SLB successfully separated the spacecraft and at 03:28 UTC, first signals from spacecraft were received. The launch put the satellite with margins of its planned geosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 10,286 km, an apogee of 35,790 km and a 12° inclination to the Equator.

Her students included Barry Douglas, Ignat Solzhenitsyn, Martha Argerich, Evelyne Brancart, Radu Lupu, Dame Mitsuko Uchida, Myung-Whun Chung, Leon Fleisher, Rafael Orozco, Christopher Elton, Hilary Coates, Simone Dinnerstein Massimiliano Mainolfi and Geoffrey Tozer. She was the last student of Artur Schnabel and she passed on his teachings to her own students. Biography Maria Curcio was born in Naples in 1918, to an Italian father and a Jewish-Brazilian mother, also a pianist who had studied with a pupil of Ferruccio Busoni.Times Online, 25 April 2009 She was playing by age three, and at age seven was taken to Rome to play for Benito Mussolini, but refused to do so. She was tutored at home to leave more time for practising, but she did not have a happy childhood, as she was pushed into accepting too many engagements too soon, and there was no time to play or have friends. Ottorino Respighi invited her to give a recital at his house. She was accepted to the Naples Conservatory at age nine, receiving her degree by 14.Find-a-Grave Her mother arranged for her to study with Alfredo Casella and Carlo Zecchi (a pupil of Artur Schnabel) in Italy, and with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. She also studied with Artur Schnabel himself from age 15; he did not normally take young pupils, but his son Karl Ulrich persuaded him to audition her. When he did so, he described her as \\"one of the greatest talents I have ever met\\". When Schnabel was on tour, she had lessons with Fritz Busch. She made her London debut in 1939,Liverpool Daily Post, 9 April 2009 but at the outbreak of World War II, she was in Amsterdam, where she had followed Schnabel's secretary Peter Diamand, and where she performed frequently. However, during the German occupation of the Netherlands from 1940, when Jews were banned from playing in public, she turned down all offers of engagements in protest (Diamand was Jewish). Diamand spent some time in a Dutch concentration camp before escaping. They then needed to hide from the Nazis, in attics and other cramped places, with inadequate food. She became a victim of malnutrition and tuberculosis, unable to even walk properly, let alone play. Her performing career was now effectively over. She married Diamand in 1948, but she needed years of therapy to restore her power to her legs, arms and fingers. Wilhelm Furtwängler wanted to record with her, but by the time he died in 1954 she still had not recovered sufficient strength. She did, however, finally return to playing; she collaborated with such artists as Benjamin Britten, Carlo Maria Giulini, Szymon Goldberg, Otto Klemperer, Josef Krips, Pierre Monteux and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Her last performance was in 1963. She then turned to teaching and giving master classes. She also coached singers at Josef Krips's request when he conducted the Netherlands Opera. In the meantime, Peter Diamand had been appointed director of the Edinburgh Festival and they had moved to the UK. She served on the jury of the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition in 1966. She was appointed Visiting Professor at the Royal Academy of Music, University of London. She played privately with Sir Clifford Curzon, who had introduced her to Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and their circle in 1947. She often played four-hand piano music with Britten.Michael Church She and her husband divorced in 1971 after he had a relationship with Marlene Dietrich. She spent her last few years in Porto, Portugal, where she died in March 2009, aged 90.

It is located in the port of Hamburg--within the HafenCity quarter--and was built from 1883 to 1927. The district was built as a free zone to transfer goods without paying customs. As of 2009, both the district and the surrounding area are under redevelopment. As the first site in Hamburg, it was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site on 5 July 2015. Geography The Speicherstadt is located in the port of Hamburg. It is long and interlaced by loading canals (Low German: Fleets). History Since 1815, the independent and sovereign city of Hamburg was a member of the German Confederation--the association of Central European states created by the Congress of Vienna--but not member of the German Customs Union. Following the Austro-Prussian War which established Prussian hegemony in north Germany, Hamburg was obliged to join the North German Federation.Planung und Finanzierung der Speicherstadt in Hamburg ,by Frank M. Hinz; publ. LIT Verlag Münster, 2000; page 45 However it obtained an opt-out in the form of Article 34 of the North German constitution,Constitution of the North German Federation //de.wikisource.org/wiki/Verfassung_des_Norddeutschen_Bundes Retrieved Dec 2017 which stated that Hamburg and the other Hanseatic cities would remain as free ports outside the Community customs border until they apply for inclusion. Article 34 was carried over into the imperial constitution of 1871, when the south German states joined the federation. However, Hamburg came under great pressure from Berlin to join the Customs Union after 1879, when the latter's external tariff was greatly increased. In 1881 an agreement was signed between Prussian Finance Minister Karl Hermann Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Versmann and O'Swald, and the envoy of the Hanseatic states in Berlin, Dr. Krüger, on the other. Hamburg would join the Customs Union with all its territory, except a permanent free port district which the agreement specified. For this district, Article 34 would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished or restricted without Hamburg's approval.Hamburg and the Freeport - Economy and Society 1888–1914, by Peter Borowsky, publ Hamburg University Press, Hamburg, 2005; p. 114 In 1883, to clear space for the new port area, the demolition of the Kehrwieder and Wandrahm area began and more than 20,000 people needed to be relocated. The construction was completed before the start of World War I, managed by the Freihafen-Lagerhaus-Gesellschaft (the predecessor of the Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG), which was also responsible for the subsequent operation. After the destruction of about half of the buildings in Operation Gomorrah by bombing during World War II, the conservative rebuilding was finished in 1967, while the Hanseatic Trade Center occupies now the sites of the completely destroyed structures. In 1991 it was listed as a protected Hamburg heritage site. Since 2008, it has been part of the HafenCity quarter. In an attempt to revitalize the inner city area, the Hamburg government initiated the development of the HafenCity area, for example with the construction of the Elbe Philharmonic Hall. Architecture alt=A red brick multi-storey house in Neo-Gothic style with little towers and other ornamental features. 'Wasserschloss' at Holländischbrookfleet The warehouses were built with different support structures, but Andreas Meyer created a Neo-Gothic red- brick outer layer with little towers, alcoves, and glazed terra cotta ornaments. The warehouses are multi-storey buildings with entrances from water and land. One of the oldest warehouses is the Kaispeicher B of the International Maritime Museum. Hafenrathaus ('Harbour City Hall') in the Speicherstadt Use The Speicherstadt is a major tourist attraction in Hamburg and is the focus of most of the harbor tours. There are several museums like the ' (German Customs Museum), Miniatur Wunderland (a model railway) and the Hamburg Dungeon. The Afghan Museum was also located here, but closed in 2012. The buildings are also used as warehouses. As of 2005, the companies in the Speicherstadt handled one-third of the world's carpet production, and other goods including cocoa, coffee, tea, spices, maritime equipment, and electronics.

Background and education The third of the six children of Lord Buxton of Alsa (founder of Anglia Television and the television series Survival) and Pamela Mary Birkin, daughter of Sir Henry Birkin, she was educated at New Hall School, Chelmsford, Essex. Professional career Her first wildlife film was released in 1971, when she was just 21 years old. She later became involved in filming wildlife documentary films (chiefly for her father's nature documentary television series Survival). In 1978 she co-wrote the first scientific paper about the Shoebill, in Zambia. Her 1980 book \\"Survival in the Wild\\" is about her first 8 years in Africa. During a filming expedition on South Georgia in March 1982, Buxton and her assistant Annie Price were caught up in the Falklands War. Argentine forces seized control of the east coast of South Georgia on 3 April 1982. Buxton and Price, who had been filming in an isolated part of the island, were trapped for four weeks before they were rescued by a helicopter from HMS Endurance on 30 April. This and her previous three years there and in Antarctica are described in her book Survival: South Atlantic. She was subsequently invited to return for the Falkland Islands' 150th anniversary celebrations in February 1983. Buxton and Annie Price won the Media Award of the Variety Club of Great Britain for 1982 and Buxton was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She now works in the field of video presentation of legal proceedings, for Z-Axis, which she joined in 1997.

He was born in Takapuna. Dowd played provincial rugby for Auckland Colts, and then from 1985 for North Harbour. He initially played as a Rugby union positions#Prop, but in 1988 was switched to hooker by his North Harbour coach Peter Thorburn. His success in his new position meant that by 1991 he was considered the second best hooker in the country, behind Sean Fitzpatrick. That year Dowd played for a New Zealand XV that faced Romania, and a New Zealand B team that faced Australia B. He was selected ahead of Warren Gatland for the All Blacks team for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dowd did not play even a minute of rugby during the 1991 World Cup, and was instead confined to the reserves bench. This was repeated in 1992 when Dowd was selected for the series against an International XV, but Fitzpatrick played every minute of the three Test matches. Dowd finally made his All Black debut against Ireland that same year, when he replaced Richard Loe at prop. It would be Dowd's only ever Test appearance, but he did play in seven mid-week matches for the All Blacks that year during their tours of Australia and South Africa. He was selected in the New Zealand squad for the British Lions series in 1993, but again achieved no game time. It was Dowd's lot to spend most of his All Black career as one of the understudies to Sean Fitzpatrick while he was at the peak of what seemed to be an indestructible hold on the hooking position. This was for some obviously a frustrating experience. But if ever the cheerful Dowd was upset he kept it very much to himself and perhaps he regarded the mere fact he was part of so many All Black squads as a bonus. For there must have been a time in Dowd's career where he never seriously contemplated gaining an All Black jersey. By 1994 Dowd had been overtaken by Norm Hewitt as Fitzpatrick's back-up, and he never represented the All Blacks again.

Until it was shut down in 1952, the engine discharged into the Blue Gowt which joins the River Glen at Surfleet Seas End. Museum In 1952 the engine was rendered obsolete by modern electric pumps, and stood forgotten until being opened to the public as a museum in 1979. The coal store was cleared and now houses the associated Museum of Land Drainage. The museum complex includes the blacksmith's shop, still in its original condition. The museum is operated by the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board,Welland and Deepings IDB successors to the commissioners who erected the engine. The buildings are Grade II listed and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The chimney was demolished in 1952, and no actions were taken to preserve the boiler, which is no longer in a fit state to be used. The engine is a static exhibit, which can be rotated by an electric motor for demonstration purposes. Beam engine The engine frame and flywheel The engine is a condensing steam engine with an overhead beam supported by an 'A'-frame. It was built by the Butterley Company of Ripley, Derbyshire. It has a single cylinder of bore and stroke. The flywheel is in diameter. The engine ran at up to 30 rpm. The engine is gear-coupled to a single scoop wheel in an adjacent compartment. There are 40 paddles around the circumference of the wheel, which could lift a maximum of of water per minute through an lift. The annual effort varied between tons of water lifted, and . Typically the engine was operated for around 180 days a year and an engine man was permanently retained, living on the site. The boiler dates from 1895 and is a twin furnace Lancashire boiler, delivering 12 psi. It consumed around 1 cwt of coal per hour. Coal supplies were originally brought by barge, but after the land was successfully drained a railway line was laid from Spalding to Boston, and coals were delivered to a nearby goods facility. They were then transported on a very short narrow gauge railway line in colliery-style tubs. The motive power for this appears to have been human. One of the tubs and a metre or so of line is displayed at the museum. The engine is said to be the earliest 'A'-frame engine still in situ, the longest-working beam engine in the Fens, and the last in use.

British Airways (BA), the United Kingdom's national airline, was formed in 1974 with the merger of the two largest UK airlines, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA), and including also two smaller regional airlines, Cambrian Airways and Northeast Airlines. The merger was the completion of a consolidation process started in 1971 with the establishment of the British Airways Board, a body created by the British government to control the operations and finances of BOAC and BEA, which initially continued to exist as separate entities. British Airways acquired the supersonic Concorde in 1976, operating it on transatlantic services. The same year it assumed sole operation of international flights to North America and Southeast Asia from rival British Caledonian. The formation of Virgin Atlantic in 1984 began a tense rivalry, which led to \\"one of the most bitter and protracted libel actions in aviation history\\". Under the leadership of Chairman Sir John King and CEO Colin Marshall, British Airways was privatised in February 1987, and in July of the same year, it launched the controversial takeover of British Caledonian. Following privatisation, British Airways entered a period of rapid growth, leading to the use of the slogan \\"The World's Favourite Airline\\", and dominated its domestic rivals during the early 1990s. Faced with increased competition and higher costs in the mid-1990s, CEO Bob Ayling led a restructuring effort, leading to trade union clashes; the carrier also invested in regional European airlines, courted international airline partnerships, and attempted a controversial ethnic livery rebranding campaign. In the early 2000s, CEO Rod Eddington implemented further cost cuts, the retirement of Concorde, and the removal of ethnic liveries. Under Willie Walsh, who became CEO in 2005, British Airways faced a price-fixing scandal, moved its primary hub to Heathrow Terminal 5, and experienced threats of industrial action, leading to a strike in March 2010. On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia Airlines had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although BA continues to operate under its own brand. The combined airline became the world's third-largest carrier (after Delta Air Lines and American Airlines) in terms of annual revenue. Origins and formation Imperial Airways Handley Page H.P.42. Hanno in 1931 On 31 March 1924, Britain's four pioneer airlines that started up in the immediate post war period—Handley Page Transport, British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd, Daimler Airways and Instone Air Line—joined together to form Imperial Airways Limited,Millward (2008), p. 83 developing routes throughout the British Empire to India, some parts of Africa and later to Canberra, Australia. Meanwhile, a number of smaller UK air transport companies had begun operating, and by 1935 many of these had merged to form the original privately owned British Airways Ltd. Following a government review, Imperial Airways and British Airways were nationalised in November 1939 to form the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).Woodley (2004), p. 10 BOAC de Havilland Comet 1 at Heathrow Airport in 1953 Post-war, BOAC continued to operate the majority of long-haul services in Britain, other than routes to South America; these were flown by British South American Airways, which was merged back into BOAC in 1949.Beith (2004) Continental European and domestic flights were flown by a new nationalised airline, British European Airways Corporation (BEA), which compulsorily took over the scheduled services of existing UK independent airlines. On 2 May 1952, BOAC became the world's first airline to operate jet airliners; the inaugural flight with the de Havilland Comet 1 was from London to Johannesburg.Woodley (2004), p. 117 However, the Comet's service introduction was plagued by structural problems and accidents, leading to its withdrawal in 1954 and replacement with the upgraded Comet 4 models in 1958. Boeing 707-400 at Heathrow Airport in 1960 The first attempt to create a new combined British airline through the merger of BOAC with BEA arose in 1953 out of inconclusive attempts between the two airlines to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the Middle East. In this proposal, Thomas had backing from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve Ankara in Turkey, and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. However, the solution was not entirely satisfactory to BOAC, as BEA's effective control of Cyprus Airways gave it the ability to continue to serve destinations ostensively ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy.Robin Higham, Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC (London: IB Tauris, 2013) p.117 In 1967, the government established a committee of inquiry into Civil Aviation under Sir Ronald Edwards. The Edwards Committee reported in 1969 and one of its recommendations was the formation of a National Air Holding Board to control finances and policies of the two corporations. The recommendation was enacted in 1971 with the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1971, which formed a British Airways Board to control all the activities of BOAC and BEA, including the newly formed BEA Airtours subsidiary which targeted the emerging package holiday business. Consequently, in 1972 the BOAC and BEA managements were combined under the newly formed British Airways Board, with the physical operations of the separate airlines coming together as British Airways on 1 April 1974, under the guidance of David Nicolson as Chairman of the Board.Doganis (2006), p. 224 At the time it was the biggest merger in the aviation industry,By some criteria. By passenger-miles (and maybe by passengers) the merged airline was smaller than Delta when it merged Northeast in 1972. creating the world's largest network of routes for the new unified company to harness.Hanlon (1999), pp. 227–8 In 1975, British Airways was headquartered in the Victoria Terminal in London. Its international division was headquartered at Speedbird House by Heathrow Airport, while its European division was headquartered at Bealine House, Ruislip, Middlesex. The regional division was headquartered in Ruford House, Hounslow. 1970s: Consolidation and Concorde A British Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident in BEA- BA crossover livery. The newly formed British Airways had inherited a mix of aircraft from its predecessors. It quickly retired the Standard VC10s that had come from BOAC and the last Vickers Vanguards from BEA.Pigott (2003), p. 166 It also ordered the Hawker Siddeley 748 for use on Scottish routes to enable the Vickers Viscount to be retired. The first Lockheed L-1011 TriStar was delivered in October 1974, and introduced in January 1975; more TriStars were ordered in following years. The management of British Airways resisted political pressure to purchase the new Airbus A300, stating that it had no requirement for the aircraft;Hayward (1983), p. 167 this rejection complicated Britain's integration into the European Union.Penrose (1980), p. 285 Instead, the company planned to acquire American-made planes such as the Boeing 757;Hayward (1983), p. 170 in 1976 the British government approved the purchase of multiple Boeing 737 aircraft.Hayward (1983), p. 182 An innovation on 12 January 1975 was the British Airways Shuttle service from Heathrow to Glasgow (and later Edinburgh, Manchester and Belfast), which allowed a walk-on no reservation service with a \\"guaranteed seat\\" — this latter feature facilitated by backup aircraft or sometimes transfers to British Midland flights. Boeing 747-100 at Heathrow Airport in 1976 The Secretary of State for Trade, Peter Shore, reviewed the Government's aviation policy and in 1976 announced a \\"spheres of influence\\" policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes.Thomson (1990), pp. 316–7 British Airways and British Caledonian, the second-biggest airline in Britain, were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled flights on long-haul routes. British Caledonian had to withdraw from East Africa and from the London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes in favour of BA. In return, British Caledonian became the sole British flag carrier to the entire South American mainland, taking over routes formerly served by British Airways to Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. British Airways Concorde at Heathrow Airport in 1980 In 1976, British Airways commenced flying Concorde, making it one of two airlines to own and operate the supersonic Aerospatiale-BAC airliner. Simultaneously with Air France, BA inaugurated the world's first supersonic passenger service on 21 January, a daily service between Heathrow and New York becoming one of the airline's hallmarks. Initially, Concorde was a financial burden,Hayward (1983), p. 132 required of the national carrier by the government, and it attracted criticism from the press as a white elephant. Several significant destinations suggested for Concorde, such as Tokyo, Japan, and Sydney, Australia never emerged as viable in reality.Owen (2001), p. 295 In 1981, Sir John King, later Lord King, was appointed Chairman of British Airways with the mission of preparing the airline for privatisation. King recognised the prestige that Concorde brought to the airline, purchased them outright from the government, and was turning a profit within a year. According to British Airways' management the aircraft broke even on flights holding around 40–45% of passenger capacity; in 1985 the average passenger capacity in use per flight was at 65%. BA used Concorde to win business customers, guaranteeing a certain number of Concorde upgrades in return for corporate accounts with the airline—a key factor in winning business from transatlantic competitors. Although the carrier did not disclose specific numbers, media reports estimated that the Heathrow to New York service made an annual operating profit by the early 2000s (decade). 1980s: Privatisation and dirty tricks British Airways main office at Heathrow Airport in the 1980s As British Airways headed towards privatisation, Sir John King hired Colin Marshall as CEO in 1983. King was credited with transforming the loss-making giant into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world, boldly claiming to be \\"The World's Favourite Airline\\", while many other large airlines struggled. The airline's fleet and route map were overhauled in the early years of King's tenure, with brand and advertising experts being recruited to change the airline's image. Over 23,000 jobs were shed in the early 1980s,Votteler (1988), p. 86 though King managed the considerable trick of boosting staff morale and modernising operations at the same time. Offering generous inducements for staff to leave led to record losses of , to the cost of taxpayers but to the benefit of the future privatised company. British Airways aircraft at Heathrow Terminal 1 in the early 1980s. British Airways Concorde at Basel Mulhouse Airport in 1986 At Marshall's direction, the airline consolidated most of its long-haul operations in 1986, including Concorde services, at the newly constructed Heathrow Terminal 4. Terminal 4 would remain as BA's hub at Heathrow Airport for the next 22 years.Donne (1991), p. 41 Due in part to a recession and rising fuel prices, aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Vickers Super VC10 and Boeing 707 were quickly phased out of service, and planes such as the Boeing 737 were acquired in their place. In an effort to increase the use of the operational Concorde fleet, King allowed the planes to be chartered for special services. Concorde services to Singapore in cooperation with Singapore Airlines began, in addition to a service to Miami by 1984. In the 1980s, British Airways regarded Concorde as its flagship, both prestigious and profitable. British Airways BAC One-Eleven in Landor livery at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1984–1997 Landor livery in 1986 The flag carrier was privatised and floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987 by the Thatcher government, the initial share offering was nine times oversubscribed.Dearlove (2000), p. 532 The privatisation of British Airways was regarded as very successful by industry observers, perhaps the most successful of a series of companies divested by the state in this era.Dearlove (2000), p. 416 Four months later, in July 1987, BA announced the controversial takeover of Britain's \\"second\\" airline, British Caledonian.Thomson (1990), pp. 528–9, 537–8 The acquisition led to concerns regarding competition;Hanlon (1999), p. 228 within the industry it was widely acknowledged as a mutually agreed rescue deal to avoid the latter's collapse.Simons (1999), p. 100 The Caledonian name was kept alive, the charter subsidiary British Airtours being rebranded as Caledonian Airways. In 1992, BA absorbed Gatwick-based British carrier Dan-Air. Soon after British Airways' privatisation, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic began to emerge as a competitor on some of BA's most lucrative routes. Following Virgin's highly publicised mercy mission to Iraq to fly home hostages of Saddam Hussein in 1991, King is reported to have told Marshall and his PA Director David Burnside to \\"do something about Branson\\".Martyn (2000) This began the campaign of \\"dirty tricks\\" that ended in Branson suing King and British Airways for libel in 1992.Fisher (2008), p. 87 King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993. British Airways, faced with likely defeat, settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson and a further £110,000 to his airline; furthermore, BA was to pay the legal fees of up to . Branson divided the compensation among his staff, the so-called \\"BA bonus.\\" British Airways and Virgin Atlantic continued to be noticeably bitter and active rivals for many years afterwards.Hanlon (1999), p. 60 1990s: Changes, subsidiaries and growth British Asia Airways Boeing 747-400 in Landor livery variant at Narita International Airport in the 1990s During the 1990s, British Airways became the world's most profitable airline under the slogan \\"The World's Favourite Airline\\". In 1992, it bought the small German domestic airline Delta Air Transport and renamed it Deutsche BA. By the time it was sold in June 2003, Deutsche BA was operating 16 and had 800 staff. British Airways also entered the French market in 1994 by purchasing a 49.9% stake in TAT European Airlines, and 70% of Air Liberté in 1997,Hanlon (1999), p. 212 seeking to challenge the dominance of Air France. British Airways Boeing 747-400s at Heathrow Airport in the 1990s 1993 was a highly significant year of expansion and change for British Airways, as it purchased a 25% stake in Australian airline Qantas, a 24% stake in American airline USAir, and wholly acquired Brymon Airways to form BA Connect.Doganis (2006), p. 76 BA had planned to acquire as much as a 44% share in USAir, but backed down following a lack of approval from the US government; developing a significantly larger presence in the North American market remained a major priority of British Airways throughout the 1990s.Doganis (2006), pp. 78, 101 Another crucial event in 1993 occurred as BA formed British Asia Airways, a subsidiary based in the Republic of China (Taiwan), to operate between London and Taipei. Owing to political sensitivities, British Asia Airways had not only a different name but also a different livery, the Union Flag tailfin being replaced by the Chinese characters 英亞 (English Asia). Perhaps the most symbolic change to British Airways in the turbulent year of 1993 came when Lord King stepped down as chairman of the company and was replaced by former deputy Colin Marshall. Bob Ayling, who later took on the role of CEO, was appointed Managing Director by Marshall. Lord King was appointed as President of British Airways, a role created specifically for him and which he retained until his death in July 2005. In 1995, British Airways began planning for its future corporate headquarters at Harmondsworth Moor,\\"Community – Biodiversity at Harmondsworth Moor.\\" British Airways. Retrieved 18 May 2009. to supplant its then- headquarters at Speedbird House at Heathrow Airport. Boeing 777-200 in Landor livery in 1996 British Airways also used some of its prosperity to upgrade and replace much of its fleet. Aircraft acquisitions included the Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 777, aimed to phase out the remaining Lockheed L-1011 TriStars and McDonnell . Six of the disposed TriStars ended up seeing service as aerial refuelling tankers in the Royal Air Force. Another acquisition was BA's first purchase from Airbus of A320 aircraft. In 1995, British Airways signed a franchise agreement with GB Airways, the airline at the time had been operating flights to holiday destinations for a number of years from Gatwick. The agreement was set to last until 2010 and the airline would operate all aircraft under the British Airways brand. By the time that GB Airways was sold to EasyJet in 2007 GB Airways had grown to operations out of Gatwick, London Heathrow, Manchester, Bristol and East Midlands Airport, the deal was worth £103.5 million. The franchise agreement ended on 29 March 2008. A new source of competition emerged during the 1990s in the form of the budget airline; new companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet emerged, rising to prominence using a no-frills and low-price approach to gain marketshare from the traditional carriers. In the wake of deregulation, these airline companies would prove to be an increasing source of competition domestically to British Airways. A small handful of short routes also came under pressure from modern high-speed rail systems, such as the Eurostar service between London, Paris, and Brussels. 1996: Bob Ayling era In 1996, British Airways, with its newly appointed CEO Bob Ayling, entered a period of financial turbulence due to increased competition, high oil prices, and a strong pound. The airline's management clashed with trade unions over planned changes, Ayling taking a hardline stance; the resulting disruption from the confrontations cost the company hundreds of millions of pounds. With several strikes and BA's restructuring plans stalling, investors became frustrated. Over time, the company was seen as being less active and successful than its peak in 1993, causing its share value to suffer. In 1996, relations between British Airways and USAir, in which BA held a stake then valued at , soured, despite Ayling's preference to \\"...remain a major investor in USAir\\", and BA later sold its share in the company. Ayling had also pursued partnership and antitrust immunity with American Airlines, however this was unsuccessful due to the conditions placed on the deal by regulatory authorities,Doganis (2006), p. 67 the most painful of which would have been the sacrifice of landing slots at Heathrow,\\"Docket OST-97-2058.\\" United States Department of Justice. Retrieved 25 May 2009. and in part caused the breakdown of the partnership with USAir as well. Boeing 737-400 with ethnic livery introduced in 1997 In 1997, Ayling dropped BA's traditional Union Flag tailfin livery in favour of world design tailfins, in an effort to change the airline's image to be more cosmopolitan; several members of the senior management had expressed negative opinions of nationalism within the company.Hanlon (1999), p. 260 This move quickly came under fire by the media for making hundreds of employees redundant while squandering money on expensive rebranding.Haig (2005), p. 182 Several influential figures, such as former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, spoke out against abandoning the Union Flag scheme and BA turning its back on the nation. British Airways' long-time rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of BA's public relations blunder and adopted the British flag along with the slogan \\"Britain's national flagcarrier\\", recognising the value and prestige of bearing the flag. Ayling eventually declaring the fleet would sport a dual livery; half Union Flag, half the world design tailfins. On 6 June 1999, he announced that all newly delivered and overhauled BA planes would bear the Union Flag, based on a design first used on Concorde; the cosmopolitan scheme was abandoned. Benefits during Ayling's leadership included cost savings of £750 million and the establishment of the successful, but highly subsidised, Go in 1998. Go was a low-cost carrier intended to compete in the rapidly emerging \\"no-frills\\" segment.Votteler (1988), p. 88 After four years of successful operations British Airways searched for a buyer for Go, eventually the airline was sold off to venture capitalists 3i and later merged with EasyJet. Ayling also sought a reduction of capacity, cancelling orders in favour of the and rationalising BA's short-haul fleet with new Airbus A320 aircraft. However, BA began discussions with Airbus for the eventual procurement of the Airbus A380, a very large passenger jet.Norris (2005), p. 55 In September 1998, British Airways became a founding member of the Oneworld global airline alliance, along with American Airlines, Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and Qantas. As part of the marketing alliance, member airlines combined frequent-flyer program benefits and streamlined inter-airline connections. Waterside, the current British Airways head office, officially opened in 1998. In late 1999 British Airways agreed to another franchise agreement with the small Dutch regional airline Base Regional Airlines. The airline operated out of Eindhoven Airport to six destinations across Europe including Hamburg, Zurich, and London Heathrow. The franchise agreement was the third to be made with an international airline since Comair and Sun Air of Scandinavia. 2000: Rod Eddington era British Airways Boeing 747-400 with ethnic livery In 1999, British Airways reported a 50% drop in profits, its worst since privatisation. This was compounded by the majority of BA subsidiary companies running at heavy losses as well; the company reacted by selling several.Doganis (2006), p. 77 In March 2000, Bob Ayling was removed from his position and, in May, British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. Eddington set about the termination of several investment programs, such as in Olympic Airways, and cutting the workforce, the process being taken still further in response to the slump caused by the 9/11 attacks in 2001. BA's share price dropped from 760p in May 1997 to only 150p in September 2001, showing how heavily the company had been hit. British Airways Concorde G-BOAB in storage at Heathrow Airport With the crash of Air France Flight 4590 in 2000, 9/11, and escalating maintenance costs, the future of Concorde was limited, despite expensive safety modifications made after the Air France accident. It was announced on 10 April 2003 that in October that year BA would cease scheduled services with Concorde, due to depressed passenger numbers. The last commercial Concorde flight from New York to London was on 24 October 2003. The airline retained ownership of eight Concordes, which were placed on long-term loan to museums in the UK, U.S. and Barbados. During Eddington's leadership, there were several other fleet changes. A publicly well-received decision of Eddington's was to completely end the use of ethnic liveries on aircraft, announcing in May 2001 that all of BA's fleet would be repainted in a variant of the Union Flag design used on Concorde. All Boeing 747-200s and older Boeing 767 aircraft were retired in 2001 and 2002 in an effort to cut costs, and interest was expressed in the upcoming Boeing 7E7 and the since- cancelled Boeing Sonic Cruiser. In late 2001 the franchise agreement with Base Regional Airlines was ended after just over 2 years of operations, the airline had filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. British Airways Airbus A320-200 in Union Flag livery From 2002, BA strongly marketed the full-service nature of its remaining domestic flights by the use of principal airports, and provision of complimentary food and drink. This came as a response to low-cost operators' aggressive pricing, even though its main full-service UK rival bmi later also abandoned some \\"frills\\" on its domestic network. In June 2003, the German subsidiary, Deutsche BA, was sold to investment group Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft. On 8 September 2004, British Airways announced that it was to sell its 18.5% stake in Qantas, but would continue the alliance (such as sharing revenue), particularly on the Kangaroo Route.\\"British Airways to sell its Qantas stake .\\" Airline Industry Information. 8 September 2004. The raised was used to reduce the airline's debt. Lord Marshall, who had been appointed a life peer in 1998, retired as Chairman in July 2004 and was replaced by Martin Broughton, former Chairman of British American Tobacco. On 8 March 2005, Broughton announced that former Aer Lingus CEO Willie Walsh would take over from Rod Eddington upon his retirement in September 2005. Walsh pledged to retain the full-service model on its much reduced UK network as a means of distinguishing BA from the competition, and that customers were willing to pay extra for higher service levels. 2005: Willie Walsh era British Airways Boeing 747-400 in Oneworld livery at Heathrow Airport In September 2005, new CEO Willie Walsh announced dramatic changes to the management of British Airways, with the aim of saving by 2008, the cost of the airline's move to its new hub at Heathrow's Terminal 5. Walsh presided over the sale of BA Connect to Flybe, stating \\"Despite the best efforts of the entire team at BA Connect, we do not see any prospect of profitability in its current form.\\" BA retained a 15% stake in Flybe following the sale. In June 2006, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) began investigating allegations that BA was price-fixing fuel surcharges on long haul flights. The allegations first came to light when Virgin Atlantic reported the events to the authorities after it found staff members from BA and Virgin Atlantic were colluding. Virgin Atlantic was later granted immunity by both the OFT and DOJ. The price-fixing probe led to the resignation of commercial director Martin George and communications chief Iain Burns. On 1 August 2007, British Airways was fined for price-fixing by the OFT, and the US DOJ subsequently announced that it would also fine British Airways () for price-fixing. Although BA said fuel surcharges were \\"a legitimate way of recovering costs\\", in May 2007 it had put aside for legal fees and fines. In July 2009 Steve Ridgway, the CEO of Virgin Atlantic, admitted he knew about the illegal price-fixing at his airline and did nothing to stop it. The Compass Centre, when it was a British Airways facility, in 2006 In January 2008, BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies which took advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights, flying non- stop between major European cities and the United States. Operations between Paris and New York began with a single in June 2008. On 2 July 2008 British Airways announced that it had agreed to buy French airline L'Avion for . L'Avion was fully integrated with OpenSkies in 2009. OpenSkies Boeing 757-200 at Sheremetyevo International Airport On 14 March 2008 Heathrow Terminal 5, built exclusively for the use of British Airways at a cost of , was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Upon opening to passengers on 27 March 2008 serious problems immediately arose, many from staff confusion. The baggage handling system failed completely, resulting in seven flights departing with no baggage loaded. In the first five days, a backlog of 28,000 bags built up and over 300 flights were cancelled. Walsh commented that it \\"was not our finest hour ... the buck stops with me\\". Two directors left BA in April 2008 over the troubled transition to Terminal 5. Walsh also declined his annual bonus over Terminal 5, despite record profits overall. By October 2008 Terminal 5 operations has settled and further long-haul flights were transferred over. 2009: Financial difficulties, disruptions and merger Since 2008, most British Airways operations have been based at Heathrow Terminal 5 On 30 July 2008, British Airways and Iberia Airlines announced a merger plan that would result in the two airlines joining forces in an all- stock transaction. The two airlines would retain their separate brands similar to KLM and Air France in their merger agreement. In the beginning of August 2008, American Airlines announced an alliance with BA and Iberia, allowing the two carriers to fix fares, routes, and schedules together. In addition to merger talks with Iberia, it was announced on 2 December 2008 that British Airways was discussing a merger with Qantas. If British Airways, Iberia and Qantas were to combine as one company it would be the largest airline in the world. However, on 18 December 2008, the talks with Qantas ended due to issues over ownership. In November 2010, BA was fined €104 million by the European Commission following an investigation into price-fixing. British Airways and Iberia announced their merger in April 2010, creating the International Airlines Group In June 2009, British Airways contacted some 30,000 employees in the United Kingdom, including Walsh, asking them to work without pay over a period of between one week and one month to save money. On 6 November 2009 the worst ever half-year loss in British Airways' history was reported to the public. A High Court decision sided with BA against union opposition to restructuring plans, including a reduction in cabin crew in November 2009. On 14 December 2009 cabin crew at British Airways voted in favour of strike action over the Christmas period over job cuts and contract changes. On 17 December the ballot was ruled invalid by the High Court due to voting irregularities, thus the strike did not take place. On 6 March 2010 Unite announced further strike action. More than 80 planes were grounded at Heathrow Airport on the first day; however, British Airways officials stated that 65% of flights were undisturbed. On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed British Airways and Iberia Airlines had agreed to merge, making the combined commercial airline the third largest in the world by revenue. The newly merged company is known as International Airlines Group, both airlines continue to operate under their current brands. The merger is believed to be worth approximately , the new group has over 400 aircraft and flies to over 200 destinations across the world. As part of the deal, British Airways shareholders took a 55% stake in the company, headquartered in London, with the remainder owned by Iberia. Industry analysts have speculated that the merger makes a three-way tie-in with American Airlines more likely. Across April and May 2010, much of Western and Northern Europe had their airspace closed due to huge density ash clouds from the erupting Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. It was feared that aircraft could be damaged or could even crash due to engine ingestion of volcanic ash, as had famously troubled British Airways Flight 9 in 1982. This affected all airlines operating within British airspace, leading to strong objections from companies such as Ryanair. Flights progressively restarted as the ash levels declined. On 4 October 2010, to celebrate the Boeing 757 fleet's retirement after 27 years, British Airways unveiled one of the 757s (G-CPET) in a \\"retro\\" Negus & Negus livery. This aircraft conducted its last passenger flight on 6 November 2010, the proceeds of which went to the charity Flying Start the charity partnership between British Airways and Comic Relief. In May 2017, BA's entire fleet was grounded for two days, due to a failure of their IT system, which the company believed to be caused by too many cutbacks in the company. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in July 2020 BA announced it planned to make 12,000 staff redundant.British Airways pilots vote to accept jobs deal BBC News 1 August 2020 It also brought forward the retirement of its 31 Boeing 747-400s, with all retired with immediate effect.British Airways retires entire 747 fleet after travel downturn BBC News 17 July 2020 Liveries and logos=Hybrid/transition liveries File:Boeing 747-136, British Airways AN1861141.jpgex-BOAC Boeing 747 with \\"British airways\\" branding and Speedbird tail File:British Airways Cargo Merchantman Wheatley.jpgex-BEA Vickers Vanguard with \\"British airways\\" branding and Speedjack tail File:Northeast Airlines Trident 1E at Teesside Airport (1974) - geograph.org.uk - 852594.jpgex-Northeast Hawker Trident with \\"British airways\\" branding and Norjet tail. The aeroplanes that British Airways inherited from the four-way merger between BOAC, BEA, Cambrian, and Northeast were initially given a livery nicknamed 'hybrid' or 'transition', using the text \\"British airways\\" (stylised with a lowercase \\"a\\" in Airways) to replace the original wordmark, but otherwise keeping the predecessor airline's livery. For instance, ex-BOAC aircraft retained the dark blue, grey, and white colour scheme with the golden Speedbird on the tail.

British Airways selected the Negus & Negus design over competing entries from Lippincott & Margulies and Henrion. The \\"Negus\\" livery was phased in over a three-year period. It also adopted a blue version of the Speedbird logo from BOAC, moved to the nose of the planes, at the request of ex-BOAC staff. The contract for British Airways was then the largest corporate identity branding commission in Europe. David Nicolson, the chair of British Airways, said it would present \\"a modern, efficient, confident and friendly face to the public.\\" A Boeing 747 (EI-ASJ/G-BDPZ), originally delivered to Aer Lingus, was leased by British Airways in 1976 and partially repainted in \\"Negus\\" livery above the passenger windows, retaining Aer Lingus livery on the cheatline and belly. Shortly after 1974, Negus & Negus convinced BA to drop \\"airways\\" from the wordmark and the aircraft were painted with just the word \\"British\\" for approximately a decade. One Boeing 757 (G-CPET) was returned to \\"Negus\\" livery with the abbreviated \\"British\\" wordmark in October 2010, just ahead of the retirement of the 757 fleet at the end of that month. Landor livery and Speedwing In 1984, a new livery designed by Landor Associates updated the airline's look as it prepared for privatization. The Speedbird was changed to a red Speedwing arrow logo carried at the cheatline, just below the passenger windows, along the length of the fuselage. The \\"A\\" in Airways was now capitalized. The company's crest was added to the tailfin, along with the motto \\"To Fly To Serve\\"; that specific element received criticism from domestic designers. June Fraser, president of the Chartered Society of Designers, wrote to The Times in protest, stating that \\"a barely distinguishable heraldic device perched incongruously above the remnants of the earlier instantly recognizable and appropriate solution\\" was an alarming development. A consonant look was applied to the Concorde, omitting the subsonic livery's blue belly. As with the prior Negus livery modified for the Concorde, the heat generated by supersonic flight required the fuselage to be painted in white. The Landor effort took eighteen months to complete at a cost of over million. The new branding was intended to demonstrate \\"professionalism and precision\\" while being \\"simple, distinctive, and dignified\\".

The variety of tailfin designs was intended to reflect the diversity of destinations and countries served by the airline's network of routes; British Airways called these \\"World Images\\" and they would become known as the \\"ethnic images\\". Examples included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy, meant to symbolize those countries. However, the Concorde fleet would have a unique tailfin design (named Chatham Dockyard Union flag) based on a stylised, fluttering Union flag. This was reported to have caused problems with air traffic control: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, but they were now harder to visually identify. The art commissioned for the new tailfin designs also appeared elsewhere, such as brochures and ticket boarding jackets. Utopia also changed the Speedwing arrow to a Speedmarque ribbon logo, now carried closer to the nose, above passenger windows.

BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan \\"Britain's national flagcarrier\\". In 1999, with approximately half the fleet already repainted with Project Utopia livery, the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all aircraft that had retained Landor livery would adopt the tailfin design Chatham Dockyard Union Flag originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag. After Ayling resigned in 2000, his successor, Rod Eddington, announced the entire fleet would receive the Chatham Dockyard Union flag tail in May 2001. The final aeroplane with a \\"Utopia\\" tail (Whale Rider) was retired in 2006. Panda face A BA Boeing 777-200 with a Panda face, marking the launch of a route from London to Chengdu in 2013 BA launched direct service between London Heathrow and Chengdu in 2013; to celebrate, the front of a Boeing 777 was painted to resemble a giant panda. The frequency of service to Chengdu was reduced in 2014 before being suspended in 2017, but was later reinstated from Gatwick starting in 2018. Retrojets In 2019, BA announced plans to repaint one of its Boeing 747 aeroplanes into a retrojet BOAC livery, matching the scheme used on those aircraft between 1964 and 1974. The retro livery was chosen to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the firm, dating back to the formation of Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited in 1919. Other aeroplanes are planned to be repainted into retro liveries, but deliveries of new aircraft will continue in the current \\"Chatham Dockyard\\" livery.

A modified BEA 'Red Square' livery used from 1959 to 1968 would be painted on an Airbus A319 (G-EUPJ), with grey wings instead of red to meet reflectivity requirements. Like the BOAC retrojet livery used on G-BYGC, the hybrid scheme using the \\"British airways\\" wordmark was not used. One week later BA announced that B747 G-BNLY would return to the Landor livery it wore upon delivery. The fourth and final retrojet livery was announced for G-CIVB on March 15, a B747 to be repainted into Negus livery.

She was the mother of two kings of Norway. It is possible, but unconfirmed, that she was also queen of Denmark or Sweden.Tora Torbergsdatter – utdypning (Merete Røskaft, Store norske leksikon) Biography Tora Torbergsdatter was born on Giske in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. She belonged to the Giskeætten, a powerful family from Giske in Sunnmøre. She was daughter of Torberg Arnesson of Giske (ca. 1000–1050) and wife Ragnhild Erlingsdatter (992), maternal granddaughter of Erling Skjalgsson and wife Astrid Eiriksdatter and paternal niece of Finn Arnesson and Kalv Arnesson.Torberg Arnesson (Store norske leksikon)Giskeætten (Store norske leksikon) Tora married King Harald Hardrada of Norway in 1048. The marriage can largely be explained by politics and alliance building. The chiefs of the Giske family played a key role in Norwegian power politics. The relationship between Tora and Harald Hardrada created strong ties with the royal family. Tora became the mother of both King Olav Kyrre and King Magnus II Haraldsson.Stúfr inn blindi Þórðarson kattar (Old Norse Teaching Texts) King Harald had previously married Elisaveta Yaroslavna during the winter of 1043–44. The prior marriage between Harald and Elisaveta is only documented by the court poet Stuv den Blinde (Stúfr inn Blindi Þórðarson Kattar). There are no other remaining documentation about her stay in Norway. It is therefore possible that Elisaveta stayed in Rus', or that she may have died on her way to Norway. However, that would mean that the daughters of Harald, Ingegerd and Maria, who are attributed to her, must have been Tora's. This is not considered likely, as Maria was engaged to Eystein Orre, who would have been her uncle had she been the daughter of Tora.http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ellisiv/utdypning It is therefore possible that Tora was Harald's concubine. In 1066, Harald invaded England, where he died. Tradition says that Elisaveta and her daughters followed Harald to England, where Maria died, as it was said, at the news of her father's death. Afterward, Elisaveta and her second daughter Ingegerd returned to Norway with the Norwegian fleet. Elisaveta was to have stayed at the Orkney islands during this trip. However, the oldest of the sagas claim that it was Tora and not Elisaveta who accompanied Harald on the trip, which is considered more likely, as she was the cousin of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Jarl of Orkney. According to Adam of Bremen, the mother of King Olav Kyrre remarried either King Sweyn II of Denmark or an unnamed Swedish king (possibly King Haakon of Sweden) as a widow, but this is unconfirmed. It is also unknown whether this refers to the actual mother of Olav Kyrre, which would mean Tora Torbergsdatter, or his stepmother, which would mean Elisiv.

The members of the Delian League/Athenian Empire (c. 478-404 BC) can be categorized into two groups: the allied states (symmachoi) reported in the stone tablets of the Athenian tribute lists (454-409 BC), who contributed the symmachikos phoros (\\"allied tax\\") in money, and further allies, reported either in epigraphy or historiography, whose contribution consisted of ships, wood, grain, and military assistance; proper and occasional members, subject members and genuine allies.  Analysis  The study of the symmachikos phoros provides the following insights: The amount of tax paid by each state is written in Attic numerals. One-sixtieth is dedicated to Athena, the patron goddess of the city.Empire of the owl: Athenian imperial finance By Loren J. Samons Page 36 (2000) The membership is not limited to Ionians or Greek city-states (see Ialysus, Mysians, Eteocarpathians and the Carians whom Tymnes rules). Allied states of Western Greece are not categorized under a fiscal district the Thracian, Hellespontine, Insular, Carian and Ionian phoros of the eastern states; somehow comparable districts to the former Achaemenid satrapies of Skudra, Hellespontine Phrygia, the Yaunâ on this side of the sea, Karka, and the Yaûna across the sea. The categorization of members under these fiscal districts appeared first in the list of 443/2 BC.Ancient Greece: Social & Historical Documents from Archaic Times to the Death of Socrates Page 274 by Matthew Dillon (2000) After 438 BC, the Carian phoros became part of the Ionian district and after c. 425 BC a new Aktaios phoros, comprising the coastal Troad, was created out of the Hellespontine district. During the Sicilian Expedition a fragmentary list suggests that the Athenian state had created a Magna Graecian district. The following names are readable: Naxians, Catanians, Sicels, Rhegians.IG I³ 291 Attica c.415 BCThe concept of neutrality in classical Greece By Robert A. Bauslaugh Page 147 (1991) The only references until now on the Pontic phoros are the list of 425/4 BCIG I³ 71 line 170 and 410/09 BC. Paradoxically, although the modern current term for the alliance is \\"Delian League\\", inscriptions have not yet been found on the island related to the League, and the information about the transfer of the treasure comes from the chronologization of the first Attic tribute list in 454 BC and not by Thucydides,Thucydides: narrative and explanation By Tim Rood Page 233 (1998) who just informs about the treasure and the center of the Athenian power/alliance being on Delos (Thuc. I.96.97). The first inscription which records the Athenians and allies comes from Delphi, dating to c. 475 BC,IG I³ 1465 Phokis — Delphi — stoich. — c.475 BC — is fragmentary, and the names of the allies are not readable or not mentioned. There is an epigraphical gap between 475 and 454 BC, although the phrase Athenians and allies is always present in historiography (Thuc. 1. 109, campaign in Egypt). The exact location of several inscribed cities is still debated. Athenian cleruchies and colonies like Amphipolis are considered part of the Athenian state and not members of the League.

The dialect group belongs to the Western Finnish dialects and it is divided into five more specific dialect groups.  Features  Like the Northern Ostrobothnian (Oulu) dialects, Peräpohjola dialects are Western dialects that show features from Eastern dialects. For instance the reflex to standard -ts- in metsä is mettä according to a Western pattern, whereas the reflex of standard -d- is deletion, 'j', or 'v', as in Eastern dialects, e.g. vedän - vejän. Epenthetic vowels (tyhjä - tyhyjä) are not common although found in southern Tornio dialects. There are no vowel or diphthong changes, a Western/standard feature, but there is a general gemination of consonants in short initial syllables (e.g. standard makaa is makkaa), as in Oulu and Eastern dialects. Palatalization is absent, which is a very Western feature, since palatalization occurs even in the (Western) Oulu dialect. A unique feature is that unstressed syllables in e.g. the illative case are preceded with an emphatic 'h', e.g. talhon vs. standard taloon, menhään vs. standard mennään. This is highly distinctive but very difficult for outsiders to imitate correctly. The pronouns are also distinct: mie (minä, \\"I\\") and sie (sinä, \\"you\\"(sg.)) are Eastern-like, while met and meän (me and meidän, \\"we\\" and \\"our(s)\\") and tet and teän (te and teidän, you (pl.) and your(s)(pl.)) are unique to Peräpohjola. Also, the reflex to the standard third-person verb suffix -vat (\\"they\\") is a simple -t, e.g. annoit vs antoivat.http://sokl.uef.fi/aineistot/Aidinkieli/murteet/perapmur.html Dialects=Tornio dialects Tornio dialects are spoken in the area surrounding Torne River in Finnish Peräpohjola (North Bothnia) and on the Swedish side of the river (Norrbotten). In Finland Tornio dialects are spoken in the municipalities of Enontekiö, Kolari, Muonio, Pello and Ylitornio. In Sweden the dialect is spoken in Hedenäset, Jukkasjärvi, Junosuando, Karesuando, Karungi, Korpilombolo, Pajala, Tärendö, Vittangi and Övertorneå. In Sweden the Tornio dialects together with Gällivare dialects are also called meänkieli. It has an official minority language status.http://vesa.lib.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin2/ysa.pl?h=me%C3%A4nkieli It has many Swedish loanwords, and partly a different spelling compared to Finnish, because of a different standardization organisation. Kemi dialects Kemi dialects are spoken in Finland in the municipalities of Inari, Kemi, Kittilä, Rovaniemi, Simo, Sodankylä, Tervola and Utsjoki. Kemijärvi dialects Kemijärvi dialects are spoken in Kemijärvi, Pelkosenniemi, Salla and Savukoski. Gällivare dialects Gällivare dialects are spoken in Sweden in Gällivare and some surrounding villages. Finnish language has been a common language spoken at home in the area but the dialects differ quite much from those spoken on the Finnish side of the border. Together with the Tornio dialects the Gällivare dialects are called meänkieli in Sweden. Meänkieli has an official minority language status in some municipalities in northern Sweden Ruija dialects Ruija dialects are spoken in Northern Norway in Alta, Lyngen, Lakselv, Kvænangen, Nordreisa and Vadsø. This dialect is called Kven language in Norway for political and historical reasons.http://www.yso.fi/onki/ysa/?c=http://www.yso.fi/onto/ysa/Y147748 References Category:Finnish dialects Category:Finnish language ","title":"Peräpohjola dialects"},{"id":"24559164","text":"Train_Man: Densha Otoko as published by Shogakukan on April 5, 2005 in Japan.

Eiland-Hall was a case filed in 2009 before the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a United Nations agency. It was filed by political commentator Glenn Beck against Isaac Eiland-Hall, concerning the website \\"GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com\\". Eiland-Hall created the site as a parody to express the view that Beck's commentary style challenged his guests to prove a negative. The site's name was based on a joke first used by comedian Gilbert Gottfried at the 2008 Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget, in which Gottfried jokingly implored listeners to disregard the (non-existent) rumor that Saget had raped and murdered a girl in 1990. Online posters began an Internet meme comparing Gottfried's joke with Beck's style of debate, by requesting Beck disprove he had committed the act in question. Eiland-Hall launched his website on September 1, 2009. Beck filed a complaint to the WIPO under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), arguing the domain name of the website was defamatory and asserted trademark infringement in its use of his name. Eiland-Hall filed a response brief to WIPO which cited the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, asserting the website's domain name was a form of free speech and satirical political humor. Beck made a supplemental filing in the case arguing the domain name was misleading and might lead individuals to believe it contained factual information. Eiland-Hall filed a surreply and stated Beck had depreciated the value of the First Amendment by attempting to evade its reach in a legal proceeding outside U.S. courts. On October 29, 2009, WIPO ruled against Beck, concluding that Eiland-Hall was making a political statement through parody in a justified usage of the Glenn Beck mark. Commentators noted Beck's actions led to a Streisand effect; his suit against the website drew increased attention to it. Representatives of Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Citizen Media Law Project were all of the opinion that Beck's trademark argument in his complaint against the website was ridiculous. The assistant director of the Citizen Media Law Project applauded WIPO's decision, saying, \\"It's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\\" Beck's representative declined comment to PC Magazine about the conclusion of the case. Lawyers for Beck did not respond to a request from National Public Radio for a comment about the WIPO ruling.  History = Background  Gilbert Gottfried joke = Gilbert Gottfried was a featured comedian at the Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget which first aired on August 16, 2008. At Saget's roast, Gottfried jokingly begged listeners to disregard the (nonexistent) rumor that his fellow comedian \\"raped and killed a girl in 1990\\". Gottfried repeatedly warned the audience at the roast not to spread the rumor, which did not exist before the comedian's speech. The audience in attendance at the Comedy Central Roast were both shocked and amused by the preposterous nature of Gottfried's joke which seemed more ludicrous each time he repeated it. = Internet meme = Glenn Beck in 2010 On August 31, 2009, a post on the Internet discussion community Fark applied Gottfried's joke to Glenn Beck. Online posters compared the Internet meme to Beck's style of arguing, requesting Beck disprove that he had committed the act in question. The meme spread to social-media websites, including Encyclopedia Dramatica, Reddit, Yahoo!, Answers.com, YouTube, Twitter and Digg.com. A variation of the Googlebomb technique was used, in which Google provided \\"Glenn Beck murder\\" as a search suggestion in a query for \\"Glenn Beck\\". Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old computer science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck and created a website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not to identify with the WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted that it did not believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership. The webpage originally displayed a small text disclaimer at the bottom, stating that the site was satirical. Eiland-Hall later placed two prominent disclaimers at the top of the page, which identified it as parody. The disclaimer at the top of the website's main page stated its entire contents was parody, and included a link to a larger disclaimer at the bottom of the page. The site criticized Beck's tactic of challenging those he opposes to prove a negative. Eiland-Hall told Politics Daily that after reading the initial thread at Fark which started the meme, he came to the conclusion that for those involved online participation in its propagation was a form of catharsis. He explained in an interview with Ars Technica that it was a means of utilizing Beck's strategies to criticize him and a way to focus exasperation around Beck's style of commentary into action. Eiland-Hall's website inspired copycat parodies.  Litigation  Beck initiates legal action = By September 3, 2009, attorneys representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, had requested that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar. Their second letter to NameCheap observed that the site was still operational on September 4, 2009, in spite of their prior requests on behalf of Beck. The domain registrar changed the name server of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting the registrar, he was permitted to return to his original name server. In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted the registrar of the domain, his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. He noted that the hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order. = WIPO complaint = In September 2009, lawyers for Beck and Mercury Radio Arts filed a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) under the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) against the privacy service for Eiland-Hall's website. WIPO is a Switzerland-based agency of the United Nations. The rules of WIPO's Arbitration and Mediation Center were created by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The privacy service for the website revealed the identity of the site's owner in response to Beck's complaint. The complaint stated that Eiland-Hall was trying to distort perceptions about the purpose and derivation of the site. Beck argued that the domain name of the website could be confused with his trademark, \\"Glenn Beck\\". The complaint described the website's domain name as libelous claiming that it encroached upon Beck's legally registered claim of his name. Beck did not claim libel or defamation in the complaint, focusing on the legal issue of trademark. The complaint asserted that the website itself contained factually inaccurate information, was unauthorized and defamatory, and that it was highly probable it would create uncertainty among Beck's potential customers. Beck's complaint asserted that the domain name of the website was an example of bad-faith registration. It argued that Eiland-Hall had no legitimate interest in, or right to, the website's domain name. As of September 2009 Beck was in the process of trademarking the use of his name for \\"goods and services\\", including the usage of \\"Glenn Beck\\" on merchandise. = Eiland-Hall response = Brief filed by respondent (September 28, 2009) Eiland-Hall retained First Amendment rights lawyer Marc Randazza to represent him. According to Randazza, Eiland-Hall sought legal representation after he was contacted with legal requests from lawyers representing Beck. On September 28, 2009 Randazza filed a 17-page response brief on behalf of his client, asserting that the website's domain name was a form of protected political speech and satirical political humor. According to Randazza, the website was used for satirical purposes and its owner was not attempting to profit from it. Randazza wrote that an individual would have to be a pathetic idiot to come under the impression that his client's website was directly affiliated with Beck, contending that the website's domain name could not be confused with the \\"Glenn Beck\\" trademark except to \\"a moron in a hurry\\". Randazza asserted that Beck had insufficiently demonstrated trademark rights to his name, \\"Glenn Beck\\", and claimed that Beck was actually trying to have the website taken down because he did not appreciate the criticism through satire which parodied Beck's own techniques. He argued that Eiland- Hall had legitimate rights to his website's domain name because of its use to criticize Beck using political satire and as part of the Internet meme which had begun on the Fark website. The brief gave a short history of Internet phenomena, including video parodies of the German film Downfall, memes based on the film 300, \\"Hitler Hates Kanye West\\", \\"All your base are belong to us\\", \\"Mr. Spock Ate My Balls\\", and the gerbil story involving Richard Gere. Randazza traced the website's origin, explaining the internet meme's roots in Gilbert Gottfried's joke. He then spelled out the root comedic intent of Eiland-Hall's website, in an explanation he termed the humor equation: : The Eiland-Hall response brief cited a clip of Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, \\"No offense and I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.\\" It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent. Randazza's argument compared the case to the Supreme Court of the United States case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Randazza wrote that Beck was attempting to evade the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by filing the legal process with an agency of the United Nations instead of in a U.S. court. In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he preferred United States law over international law. On September 29, 2009, Randazza requested that Beck voluntarily ask that the First Amendment be applied to the arbitration case, despite its international setting. Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the United States Constitution over international law. Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck in which he indicated he preferred United States law over international law. Beck had said, \\"Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead.\\" Randazza's letter concluded: \\"I am certain that neither party wishes to see First Amendment rights subordinated to international trademark principles, thus unwittingly proving Mr. Beck's point. Lest this case become an example of international law causing damage to the constitutional rights that both of our clients hold dear, I respectfully request that your client agree to stipulate to the application of American constitutional law to this case.\\" Audio interview of Marc Randazza on WPRR radio program Declaring Independence (October 8, 2009) On October 8, 2009, Randazza was interviewed about the case on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He explained why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this did not apply to Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire. = Supplemental filing and surreply = Beck submitted a supplemental filing in the case on October 13, 2009. In the supplemental filing, his attorneys argued that the joke of the Eiland-Hall website was not obvious; therefore, the website's domain name was misleading. The filing asserted: \\"While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that 'Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990,' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com (\\"Disputed Domain Name\\") in a search would have no reason not to believe that they will be directed to a website providing factual information (as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech) about Mr. Beck.\\" On October 20, 2009, Eiland-Hall filed a surreply in response to Beck's supplemental filing. Eiland-Hall asserted in the surreply that Beck was the butt of a viral joke which was protected speech even if it was not perceived as comedic in nature by the subject. He stated Beck had depreciated the value of the First Amendment by attempting to evade its reach in a legal proceeding outside U.S. courts. = WIPO ruling = On October 29, 2009, the WIPO ruled against Glenn Beck in the case. For Beck to have prevailed in the case, the WIPO court would have had to have ruled in Beck's favor on three issues: that the domain name could be mistaken for the mark \\"Glenn Beck\\"; that Eiland-Hall did not have a justifiable stake in the name, and that the domain name was \\"bad faith\\". On the first point, WIPO arbitrator Frederick M. Abbott ruled that the domain name could be confused with the \\"Glenn Beck\\" mark. On the issue of profit from Beck's mark WIPO ruled that there had not been substantial commercial activity to warrant this particular claim. Abbott was the sole arbitrator on the WIPO panel. Abbott concluded that Eiland-Hall had legitimate interests in the website's name for purposes of political satire in the form of comedic parody. Abbott did not draw a conclusion on the third point, noting that it was unlikely that Beck would have prevailed on the \\"bad faith\\" issue. Abbott wrote that the determination of whether the website is defamatory would not be an issue for WIPO. Instead, the WIPO limited the case's scope to a determination of whether the website registrant had engaged in \\"abusive domain name registration and use\\".  Eiland-Hall gives domain to Beck  On November 6, 2009, Eiland-Hall wrote to Beck, giving him control of the domain free of charge, and providing Beck with its username and password. Eiland-Hall wrote that he had made his point, and the act of filing the complaint exacerbated the situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall explained his rationale for giving away the domain name, citing his desire to protect the applicability of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied. Techdirt reported on November 6, 2009, that GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com was a dead site; by November 10 the domain name was registered to Beck's company, Mercury Radio Arts. In a notice posted to one of his other websites, Eiland-Hall wished Beck (then suffering from appendicitis) well, and characterized the conclusion of the case as a success. In a post on his blog, Eiland-Hall's lawyer Marc Randazza described the case as a victory for freedom of speech. Beck did not respond to Eiland-Hall's letter, and Beck's representative declined comment to PC Magazine about the conclusion of the case. Lawyers for Beck did not respond to a request for comment about the WIPO ruling from National Public Radio.  Commentary = Complaint and response  Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen commented on the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, could be seen as defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law. Media commentators, including Paul Schmelzer of the Minnesota Independent, Andy Carvin of National Public Radio, and Andrew Allemann of Domain Name Wire, considered Randazza's legal brief entertainingly written. Writing for Bostonist, Rick Sawyer called Randazza's legal brief very funny and considered him among the uproariously amusing wordsmiths in North Shore, Massachusetts. Eriq Gardner of Adweek noted that the case had strategic import for the field of politics, referring to Beck's style of commentary as exemplified in the interview with Congressman Keith Ellison. Chris Matyszczyk of CNET News commented on the legal issues of the case; he asked whether it should hold to U.S. law as it involved two citizens, and additionally wondered if Beck was asserting trademark over his full name or his individual first and last names as well. Ed Brayton of ScienceBlogs called Randazza's request that Beck stipulate to United States law intellectually creative. Daily Kos pointed out the inherent hypocrisy in Beck's legal position of seeking redress in an international agency when compared to his prior statements criticizing foreign law in favor of U.S. law.  Streisand effect  Commentators analyzed Beck's actions with respect to the \\"Streisand effect\\". Jim Emerson of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that the website's disclaimer was not enough to dissuade attorneys representing Beck from attempting to have the site removed, which triggered the Streisand effect and backfired against their client. Jeffrey Weiss of Politics Daily wrote that by taking legal action, Beck achieved the one impact he did not desire, namely garnering more attention for Eiland-Hall's website. John Cook of Gawker noted Beck's attempts to remove the site from the Internet helped assure it would become noteworthy because of his actions. Mike Masnick wrote about the case on Techdirt, commenting on the effect of Beck's actions on the meme's spread. He observed in retrospect it would have been advantageous for Beck to have simply done nothing rather than encourage the meme as a byproduct of his attempts to remove it from the Internet. Masnick pointed out that Beck's actions provided legitimacy to the meme's noteworthiness. Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in a Des Moines Register article: \\"Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site is like trying to eradicate Pueraria lobata the dreaded Kudzu vine that is eating the South.\\" Citizen Media Law Project observed Beck had exacerbated the situation by intimating legal tactics against Eiland-Hall, which served to increase the popularity of the meme and coverage of it among blogs.  Impact  At the conclusion of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment must allow for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after the conclusion of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon the conclusion of the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others. Wendy Davis of Online Media Daily commented on the potential impact of the case, and observed it was a victory for proponents of Internet rights. Davis pointed out a judgment for Beck would have enabled additional WIPO cases from individuals who were the focus of satire on the web, as a way for those people to avoid judgment in U.S. courts which adhere to First Amendment case law. John Cook of Gawker called Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain name over to Beck an optimal end to the affair which emphasized the ridiculousness of Beck's actions. Citizen Media Law Project assistant director Sam Bayard applauded WIPO's decision, noting, \\"It's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\\" The Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote in his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm the importance of the United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.

Playing career A Western Australian, Worsfold was taken by Brisbane with the 25th pick of the 1990 AFL Draft. He debuted in 1991 and made ten league appearances for the year, all of which Brisbane lost, but he contributed a goal in all but one them. Worsfold was also part of Brisbane's premiership win in the reserves Grand Final in 1991. He had a career best 26 disposals in a loss to Richmond in 1992 but ended the year on a bad note when he was suspended for six matches after being found guilty of striking Geelong's Ken Hinkley. Worsfold returned to the team halfway through the 1993 season but it would be his last year at the club, retiring having experiencing just three wins in 31 AFL games. Worsfold rejoined his original club, South Fremantle, in 1994. As joint captain, with former Carlton player Jon Dorotich, Worsfold helped steer South Fremantle to the 1997 Westar Rules premiership. In 2002, while playing with the Donnybrook Football Club, Worsfold broke the jaw of his Bunbury opponent, Beau Tann. The following year he fronted court, charged with grievous bodily harm but was found not guilty after arguing that the act wasn't deliberate and that he had bumped Tann with his shoulder while vying for the football. Coaching career Worsfold joined his elder brother John as a development coach at the West Coast Eagles in 2007. Family Peter is married with 3 children.

This airport is included in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (2009–2013), which categorizes it as a general aviation airport.FAA National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems: 2009-2013. Federal Aviation Administration. Published 1 October 2008. Facilities and aircraft Grand Strand Airport covers an area of at an elevation of 32 feet (10 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 5/23 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,997 by 100 feet (1,828 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending October 30, 2008, the airport had 46,670 aircraft operations, an average of 127 per day: 96% general aviation, 2% air taxi, and 2% military. At that time there were 47 aircraft based at this airport: 81% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, 2% jet and 2% helicopter. History The origins of the airport are undetermined, however it was likely built during World War II by the United States Army Air Forces. Known as Wampee Flight Strip, it was used as an auxiliary landing airfield for Myrtle Beach Army Airfield. It was closed after World War II, and was turned over for local government use by the War Assets Administration (WAA). Beginning in 1956, this was the commercial airport for Myrtle Beach and other Grand Strand communities, primarily being serviced by Piedmont Airlines. It was used until the opening of what is now Myrtle Beach International Airport in 1976 at Myrtle Beach AFB. Since 1976, the airport has been used by general aviation, primarily serving the North Myrtle Beach area. See also * South Carolina World War II Army Airfields References * Shaw, Frederick J.

In its role as a learned society, it complements established institutes and the universities. The driver for the Society's founding was the absence of a natural home for research into the creation, upgrading and sustainable use of facilities and the related dissemination of findings and knowledge in public and political forums in order to influence policy and practice. Other bodies, institutes and associations acknowledge an interest in facilities, for example in terms of their asset value or operational management. None adopt an interdisciplinary, cross-sector perspective, where the subject of interest is facilities and not the interests of a particular discipline or profession. The need for a focus on the operational performance of facilities is evident in UK government initiatives, such as the Carbon Trust, which is helping to focus attention on actions to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings and other constructed facilities and thus reduce carbon emissions.

History Locomotive No.9 at Benndorf Copper ore is found around Mansfeld, and has been mined since 1199. In 1885, a long railway opened linking the Glückhilf mine at Welfesholz and the Kupferkammer smeltery at Hettstedt. At first, the railway only carried goods traffic, but in 1882 the carriage of miners commenced. In 1883, workshops were established at Klostermansfeld. By 1930, the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn system extended to of track, serving 13 copper mines, two smelteries and had interchanges with two station served by standard gauge trains. Transporter wagons were introduced during the 1930s, along with air brakes on the rolling stock. Traffic on the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn reached its peak in 1955. The first diesel locomotives were introduced in 1961. In 1965, steam locomotive No. 10 was converted to use heavy oil as its fuel, the first narrow gauge locomotive in Germany to be so converted. Between 1964-69, the last of the copper mines at Eisleben and Hettstedt were closed. Carriage of passengers ceased in 1970. The smeltery in Eisleben closed in 1972 and the track between Eisleben and Helbra was lifted some years later. In 1989, the smeltery and power station at Helbra closed, and with it the railway too. Preservation In 1990, the railway between Hettstedt and Klostermansfeld reopened as a heritage railway. By 1993, all other lines had been lifted. In 1994, the remaining line was transferred to the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn e.V. The line is maintained as part of Germany's industrial and mining heritage.

Genoa was then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, but had only become so comparatively recently, after the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815. The uprising broke out after King Vittorio Emanuele II had signed an armistice with the Austrian general Joseph Radetzky on 25 March to end the First Italian War of Independence. The Genoese, reluctant members of the Kingdom of Sardinia, restored autonomous government in the ancient capital of the Republic of Genoa and more recently of the Napoleonic Ligurian Republic. The king sent General Alfonso La Marmora to quell the revolt. After several days of violent clashes, starting on 5 April the city was bombarded without warning for thirty-six hours in clear violation of contemporary customs of war. During the heavy bombardment, the government troops began to attack civilian homes. Genoa resisted effectively until 11 April, when the city was occupied by an army of 25–30,000 Bersaglieri. After the city was effectively occupied, Vittorio Emanuele II thanked General La Marmora in a letter.State Archive of Biella, Ferrero della Marmora Fund, Series Principi, Box VI - 11, File 141 page 1, page 2, page 3.

The term is defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is responsible for PPE regulation, as the \\"equipment that protects employees from serious injury or illness resulting from contact with chemical, radiological, physical, electrical, mechanical, or other hazards.\\" While there are common forms of PPEs such as gloves, eye shields, and respirators, the standard set in the OSHA definition indicates a wide coverage. This means that PPE involves a sizable range of equipment. There are several ways to classify them such as how gears could be physiological or environmental. The following list, however, sorts personal protective equipment according to function and body area. PPE by usage=Combat The modern PPE used in combat has been increasingly designed to address the emergent dangers poised in the increasing mix of conventional and unconventional conflicts demonstrated in the American experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. The combat protective equipment today is often typified by flame resistance, improved body armor, and reduced weight, among other advances. The gears are shown in the following list, which includes PPEs for defense against ballistic weapons are commonly worn by military and law enforcement personnel. =Shield= Workers at Chittagong ship breaking yard, without safety boots and hard hats U.S. police officer with a riot shield A shield is held in the hand or arm. Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user's entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st century, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, hostage rescue, and siege-breaching. =Torso= EOD technician wearing a bomb suit A ballistic vest helps absorb the impact from firearm-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions, and is worn on the torso. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber handgun and shotgun projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as hand grenades. Metal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from rifle rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a knife. Soft vests are commonly worn by police forces, private citizens and private security guards or bodyguards, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams. Modern body armor may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a combat helmet. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and bomb disposal officers wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection. =Head= U.S. soldier wearing a combat helmet. A combat helmet are among the oldest forms of personal protective equipment, and are known to have been worn by the Assyrians around 900BC, followed by the ancient Greeks and Romans, throughout the Middle Ages, and up to the end of the 1600s by many combatants.http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from leather and brass, and then bronze and iron during the Bronze and Iron Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged steel in many societies after about 950AD.Galea - About the Galea At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with swords, flying arrows, and low-velocity musketry. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as Kevlar and Aramid, which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not.Kevlar Pasgt Helmet Non-ballistic injuries may be caused by many things, such as concussive shockwaves from explosions, physical attacks, motor vehicle accidents, or falls.http://www.operation-helmet.org A ballistic face mask, is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of kevlar or other bullet resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to NIJ Level IIIA. =Respirator= A gas mask is worn over the face to protect the wearer from inhaling \\"airborne pollutants\\" and toxic gases. The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous or particulate. Many gas masks include protection from both types. During riots where tear gas or CS-gas is employed by riot police, gas masks are commonly used by police and rioters alike. =Limbs= Protection of limbs from bombs is provided by a bombsuit. SportsLimbs= A pair of fingerless cycling gloves. Gloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary when cycling in cold weather. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Gloves are therefore vital for insulating the hands from cold, wind, and evaporative cooling. Putting a hand out to break a fall is a natural reaction, however, the hands are one of the more difficult parts of the body to repair. There is little or no spare skin, and immobilising the hands sufficiently to promote healing involves significant inconvenience to the patient. Fingerless gloves, have a lightly padded palm of leather (natural or synthetic), gel or other material. Full-finger gloves are useful in winter, when real warmth is not an issue. These are also generally waterproof but will become soggy in heavy rain. ConstructionHead= U.S. Navy sailors loading cargo onto a container ship in Antarctica A hard hat is a type of helmet predominantly used in workplace environments, such as construction sites, to protect the head from injury by falling objects, impact with other objects, debris, bad weather and electric shock. Inside the helmet is a suspension that spreads the helmet's weight over the top of the head. It also provides a space of approximately 3 cm (1.2 inch) between the helmet's shell and the wearer's head so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Rigid plastic has been the most common material. =Respiratory system= A half face particulate mask. A respirator is designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful dusts, fumes, vapors, and/or gases. Respirators come in a wide range of types and sizes used by the military, private industry, and the public. Respirators range from cheaper, single-use, disposable masks to reusable models with replaceable cartridges. There are two main categories: the air-purifying respirator, which forces contaminated air through a filtering element, and the air-supplied respirator, in which an alternate supply of fresh air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contents. The term respirator in the hospital setting refers to the N95 filtering face piece masks that are commonly used to care for patients with Tuberculosis. There was much controversy over the use of these masks during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009. PPE by body area=Protective headgear a beekeeping hat, veil, and suit =Masks= Some masks made of hard material like those used by goaltenders in ice hockey (a goalie mask) and catchers in baseball as protection against being struck in the face. * For gas masks and similar, see #Respiratory protection. * See Mask (disambiguation) =Helmets= See Helmet#Types of helmet =Eye protection= Goggles See Eye protection. =Hearing protection= ear defenders and visor on a safety helmet *Earplug *Earmuffs *Earpads/earflaps =Other head/neck protection= *Throat guard *Headguard (Head guard) *Boxing headgear *Mouthguard *Armored/insulated hood *Association football headgear Arm/shoulder protection *Shoulder pads *Forearm guard *Fist guard *Knuckle guard *Wrist guard *Elbow guard *Elbow pad *Hand/Wrist Wraps Hand protection nitrile glove *Gloves are available to protect against: ** Chemicals, contamination and infection (e.g. disposable latex/vinyl/nitrile gloves) ** Electricity, when voltage is too high ** Extremes of temperature (e.g. oven gloves, welder's gloves) ** Mechanical hazards (e.g. rigger gloves, chainmail gloves) ** Mechanic gloves prime concern is to protect hands against mechanical type of applications, where harsh elements of mechanical work is directly detecting your hands required to be secured against the highest or lowest levels of risks depending upon the working environment which is normally measured in terms of different rating standards specifying the class of gloves. ** Lacerations and other wounds from sharp objects *Baseball glove *Belay gloves *Cycling gloves *Falconry gloves *Gymnastics grips *Hand guards *Hand/wrist wraps *Hockey glove *Wicket-keeper's gloves Body protection *Athletic supporter with cup pocket and protective cup, also called Abdomen guard or cricket box *Chestguard (Chest guard, Hogu) *Rib guard Foot/Leg/hip protection clogs *Foot guard *Hip pads (Hip pad) *Knee pads *Instep guard/instep protector *Shin guard (shin guards) *Combined knee-shin guards *Padded shorts *Bouldering mat *Chaps are individual pant leggings made of leather and worn by farriers, cowboys, and rodeo contestants to protect the legs from contact with hooves, thorny undergrowth, and other such work hazards.

It features user-submitted and editor-evaluated news and weekly user-contributed op-eds about urban planning and several related fields. The website also publishes an annual list of the top 10 books in the field published during the current year, and a directory and ranking of graduate-level education in the field of urban planning. The name of the website is a concatenation of Plan, as in the word, planning, and Netizen, a portmanteau of Internet and citizen.Planetizen Frequently asked questions page The website self-reports that it is visited by 1.5 million unique visitors each year.Planetizen Advertising page. In 2006, the website also started publishing books, including the first urban planning book for children, Where Things Are, From Near to Far, published in 2008 by Planetizen Press. This book was reviewed by The New York Times.My First Book of Urban Planning, published by The New York Times on February 20, 2009. Their 2007 book \\"Planetizen's Contemporary Debates in Urban Planning\\", a collection of brief essays published by Island Press, received positive reviews.Book review by Patrick S. McGovern in Canadian Journal of Urban Research Contributions Planetizen introduced a much-needed broader perspective on city planning in the US, which very often extends into international practice as well. Coming out of the very formal car-oriented planning philosophy and practice following the Second World War, American urbanism risked becoming a dinosaur as it missed all the exciting New Urbanist practices being implemented. The great value of Planetizen was to juxtapose ALL planning practice and let readers judge the effectiveness of each idea. Coming as it did in the internet age, it provided, and continues to provide, an extremely useful central location for urbanists and planners to follow what is happening around the world. More than any other site, Planetizen is a clearing house of planning ideas, and its inclusivity without any ideological prejudice is both refreshing and invaluable. Innovations and Debates=Suburban Sprawl The major problem in developed economies is surely sprawl and its energy-devouring urban morphology. Planetizen has broadly championed the New Urbanist solutions while juxtaposing a variety of alternatives and criticisms. This interplay lays the groundwork for facing a difficult problem. Debate on Planetizen juxtaposes practical concerns of developers and government entities with the need for more sustainable urban fabric. Developers who build Sprawl are being educated towards new strategies for a more livable suburbia. Informal Settlements In the Developing World, the major problem facing both economies and governments lies in owner-built settlements, favelas, villas miserias, gecekondu, or slums by any other name. Here the debate is more difficult to access, because for a long time, the problems and solutions found in informal settlements have been either ignored or misinterpreted by mainstream planners. Solutions to this exponentially growing problem are not obvious. Planetizen has commendably brought attention to this other side of urbanism, so often ignored by the urban planning schools. For example, it sponsored a discussion on the Bombay slum Dharavi, which brought the topic of slum clearance versus upgrading to worldwide attention.Dharavi: India's Model Slum Skyscrapers/Tall Buildings World economies and major construction companies are driven in part by building megaprojects, the most prominent component of which is one or more skyscrapers. Planetizen has opened up the debate on skyscrapers more than once. A city has to balance the drive to build high, using high-tech, with the theoretical objections that skyscrapers drain the resources and energy from the region in which they are implanted. New skyscrapers are claimed to be ecosustainable, but those claims have as many critics as they have proponents. Again, there is a need for a broad debate, and Planetizen contains many different and dissenting viewpoints on the question of skyscrapers as a viable building typology. Criticism Planetizen is often criticized for running news stories or user-contributed op-eds that are critical of current urban planning practices. Planetizen is also criticized by some urban planning educators in higher education for ranking graduate-level urban planning programs in the Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Education.UCLA Professor Randall Crane explains problems with the Planetizen ranking of graduate urban planning programs on his blog, in a post, Ranking Urban Planning Programs.

The phrase \\"on the bone\\" can also be applied to specific types of meat, most commonly ham on the bone, and to fish. Meat or fish on the bone may be cooked and served with the bones still included or the bones may be removed at some stage in the preparation.Delia Smith: Lamb Examples of meat on the bone include T-bone steaks, chops, spare ribs, chicken leg portions and whole chicken. Examples of fish on the bone include unfilleted plaice and some cuts of salmon. Meat on the bone is used in many traditional recipes.  Effect on flavor and texture  The principal effect of cooking meat on the bone is that it alters the flavour and texture. Albumen and collagen in the bones release gelatin when boiled which adds substance to stews, stocks, soups and sauces.The Sydney Morning Herald: Savour the flavour The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking.LBC: Cooking in the credit crunch  Eating meat on the bone  Consumption methods vary by size; smaller bones can be eaten whole, while larger ones can be broken or gnawed. Some meat on the bone is most commonly eaten by picking it up, notably ribs and chicken (wings, drumstick, sometimes thigh). Others are primarily eaten by cutting off the meat, such as steaks, but possibly picking up and gnawing the bone when otherwise finished. Smaller fish are often eaten whole, with the bones. Examples include whitebait of all sorts, anchovies, and smelt. In some cases the bone marrow may also be eaten, notably for beef or poultry (especially chicken), in the later case by the eater breaking or chewing off the end of a soft leg bone and sucking the marrow out.  Cooking meat on the bone  Meat on the bone typically cooks slower than boneless meat when roasted in a joint. Individual bone-in portions such as chops also take longer to cook than their filleted equivalents.The Evening Inn: Buying and Cooking Lamb  Value for money  Meat on the bone is quicker and easier to butcher as there is no filleting involved. Filleting is a skilled process that adds to labour and wastage costs as meat remaining on the bones after filleting is of low value (although it can be recovered). As a result, meat on the bone can be better value for money. However, relative value can be hard to judge as the bone part of the product is undesirable in many cultures or for larger bones even inedible. Various portions may contain a greater or lesser proportion of bone.  Ease of handling  The presence of bones may make meat products more bulky, irregular in shape, and difficult to pack. Bones may make preparation and carving more difficult.Highland Cattle World: Roast Highland Beef However, bones can sometimes be used as handles to make the meat easier to eat.  Import restrictions  Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a contagious disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health. FMD can be contracted by contact with infected meat, with meat on the bone representing a higher risk than filleted meat.Food and Agriculture Organization: Reports Archive: 33rd session - Appendix 17 As a result, import of meat on the bone remains more restricted than that of filleted meat in many countries.AOL News: EU relaxes beef import restrictions for Brazil, Argentina  Health issues = Injury  Meat and fish served on the bone can present a risk of accident or injury. Small, sharp fish bones are the most likely to cause injury although sharp fragments of meat bone can also cause problems. Typical injuries include bones being swallowed and becoming trapped in the throat, and bones being trapped under the tongue. Discarded bones can also present a risk of injury to pets or wild animals as some types of cooked meat bone break into sharp fragments when chewed.  BSE  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as \\"mad cow disease\\", is a fatal brain disease affecting cattle. It is believed by most scientists that the disease may be transmitted to human beings who eat the brain or spinal cord of infected carcasses. In humans, it is known as new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and is also fatal. The largest outbreak of BSE was in the United Kingdom, with several other countries affected to a lesser extent. The outbreak started in 1984, and continued into the 1990s, leading to increasing concern among governments and beef consumers as the risk to humans became known, but could not be quantified. Many countries banned or restricted the import of beef products from countries affected by BSE. Animal brain and spinal cord had already been removed from the human and animal food chain when, in 1997, prion infection was also detected in the dorsal root ganglia within the spinal column of infected animals. As a result, beef on the bone was banned from sale in the UK as a precaution. This led to criticism that the government was overreacting. The European Union also considered banning beef and lamb on the bone. The UK ban lasted from December 1997 to December 1999, when it was lifted and the risk from beef on the bone declared negligible.European Union DG Health and Consumer Protection: Scientific Steering Committee issues opinions  Use as a metaphor  The phrase \\"meat on the bones\\" is used metaphorically to mean substance. For example, \\"I expect that we'll start putting some meat on the bones of regulatory reform\\"The Toronto Star: U.S. dollar weakness hurts G20 indicates an intention to add detail and substance to plans for regulatory reform and implies that these plans were previously only set out in broad or vague terms. The phrase to \\"flesh out\\" relies of the same imagery in which a basic idea is likened to a skeleton or bones and the specific details of the idea to meat or flesh on that skeleton.

It is located at Hartmeyerstrasse 123, Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and open daily. The garden traces back to 1535 when medicinal plants were first grown by Leonhart Fuchs (1501-1566). In 1663 a Hortus Medicus was created by direction of Eberhard III, Duke of Württemberg (1614–74), with university gardener appointed in 1666. In 1681 Georg Balthasar Metzger (1623-1687) was named director, followed in 1688 by Rudolph Jacob Camerarius (1655-1721). The first greenhouse was completed in 1744, and noted botanist Johann Georg Gmelin (1709-1755) appointed director in 1751. In 1804 a new garden was established by decree of King Frederick of Württemberg (1754-1816) under the leadership of Professor Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer (1765-1844), which grew and flourished throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. By 1809 it contained four greenhouses and a lecture hall, with its first seed catalog published in 1820, and from 1818-1825 its plants were reorganized according to the system of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. In 1846 a substantial institute building was completed and by 1859 the garden cultivated 5,226 species. In 1866 the garden's final expansion was made with the purchase of adjacent private land. In 1878 Wilhelm Pfeffer (1845-1920) became director, who inaugurated a sizable palm house in 1886. Beginning in 1888, the garden was reorganized to the Eichler system. Today's new botanical garden opened in 1969 with its first arboretum planting in the same year. In the mid 1970s the greenhouses were built, with a grass garden added in 1978-1979 and areas for plants of the Swiss and the Franconian Jura added in 1984. The alpine garden was expanded and reworked in the mid 1980s, with the Canary Island house added in 1987. In 1996 the Foerderkreis Botanical Garden was founded, and in 2000 a new medicinal plant department added. Today the garden contains more than 12,000 plant species, including major collections of Fuchsia (30 varieties) and Rhododendrons (150-180 varieties). The fuchsias are gathered in a glass and steel pavilion, built in 2001 for the 500th anniversary of the birth of Leonhart Fuchs. Collections * Alpinum and Alpine house - collections of mountain plants organized in ecological and geographical areas, with excellent collections from Europe, Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia / New Zealand, and Antarctica, as well as extensive collections from the Alps organized by ecology. * Arboretum (5 hectares) - more than 1000 taxa of woody plants, including the Pomarium (a collection of Swabian apple varieties). * Asia - plants from the Himalayas, with fine collections of rhododendrons and evergreen trees such as Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana; from Eastern Asia, including a relatively complete representation of Chinese rhododendrons, various maples (Acer spp.), kiwi (Actinidia), dogwood (Cornus spp.), and several specimens of Metasequoia glyptostroboides; and the Johann Georg Gmelin Siberian Department, currently under construction, which will contain representative flowering plants from Siberia. * Cottage garden - plants from a Swabian peasant's garden, including useful and ornamental plants. * Ecological area - two rows of hardy aquatic plants, and selected species grouped by ecological adaptations, such as monoecious and dioecious flowers, dune plants, lianas, rhizomes, salt plants, root climbers, xerophytes, etc. * Japan - a Japanese garden with pond, including Alnus japonica, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Cornus controversa, Cryptomeria japonica, Magnolia stellata, Taxus cuspidata, Salix sachalinensis, Sciadopitys verticillata, and Thujopsis dolabrata, as well as Japanese azaleas, Rhododendron species, Enkianthus, and Erica. * Jura - plants of the Jura Mountains. * Medicinal plants - a new medicinal herb garden reflecting interests of today's pharmaceutical industry. * North America - woods and small trees of North America, including Calocedrus decurrens, Liriodendron tulipifera, Sequoiadendron giganteum, and Taxodium distichum. * Ornamentals - ornamental plantings including varieties from East Asia and North America. * Pannonikum - plants from the Pannonikum region stretching from lower Austria to the Black Sea, including Carex humilis, Lathyrus pannonicus, Onosma visianii, Prunus fruticosa, Quercus pubescens, and Stipa capillata. * Swabian collection - plants from Swabia's steppe and heath forests, meadows, mixed deciduous forest, secondary juniper bushes, and rock formations of the White Jura. * Systematic area - a representative sample of families of angiosperms (Angiospermae), first organized in 1974 by the system of Cronquist and Takhtajan, with significant changes made in 2000-2001 to reflect molecular phylogenetic hypotheses for the evolution of angiosperms.

Background Following 39 years in exile, the widely known Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh returned to Vietnam in 2005. The visit made the front pages of state- owned newspapers. Initially, the group had government approval, and his return raised expectations that religious restrictions would be relaxed in Vietnam. During this visit, Nhat Hanh's followers were invited by Abbot Duc Nghi, a member of the official Buddhist Church of Vietnam, to occupy Bat Nha monastery and continue their sectarian practice there. Nhat Hanh's followers claim that during a sacred ceremony at Plum Village Monastery in 2006 Nghi received a transmission from Nhat Hanh and agreed to let them occupy Bat Nha. Nhat Hanh's followers spent $1 million developing the monastery, building a meditation hall for 1,800 people. The official support initially given to Nhat Hanh's supporters is now believed to have been a ploy to get Vietnam off of the US State Department's Religious Freedom blacklist, improve chances of entry into the World Trade Organization, and increase foreign investment. During a later visit to Vietnam in 2007, Nhat Hanh suggested ending government control of religion to President Nguyen Minh Triet. A provincial police officer later spoke to a reporter about this incident, accusing Nhat Hanh of breaking Vietnamese law. The officer said, “[Nhat Hanh] should focus on Buddhism and keep out of politics.” In 2008, during an interview in Italian television, Nhat Hanh made some statements regarding the Dalai Lama that his followers claim upset Chinese officials, who in turn put pressure on the Vietnamese government. The chairman of Vietnam's national Committee on Religious Affairs sent a letter which accused Nhat Hanh's organization of publishing false information about Vietnam on its Web site. It was written that the posted information misrepresented Vietnam's policies on religion and could undermine national unity. The chairman requested that Nhat Hanh's followers leave Bat Nha. The letter also stated that Abbot Duc Nghi wished them to leave. “Duc Nghi is breaking a vow that he made to us... We have videotapes of him inviting us to turn the monastery into a place for worship in the Plum Village tradition, even after he dies — life after life. Nobody can go against that wish,” said Brother Phap Kham Violent Incidents= Escalation  On June 27, 2009 electricity was cut to Bat Nha. Over the next two days mobs wielding sledgehammers, rocks, and feces raided the monastery, threatened the monks and nuns, and damaged buildings. Authorities made a decision to allow Bat Nha to remain occupied until September 2. Nhat Hanh's followers refused to go. The government continued to represent the issues at Bat Nha as an ‘internal’ matter among clergy, and the deadline passed quietly. A memo written by local officials was leaked in early September 2009. It stated, “Plum Village association has abused the religious policies of the party and state to sabotage the regime and oppose the Buddhist Church of Vietnam.” The memo claimed that Nhat Hanh's followers were breaking the law by being in the monastery and strongly encouraged local communist groups to convince the clergy to leave. On September 21, 2009 a mob appeared outside the monastery. Late that night the rooms of about 400 monastics were searched. Two monks had their IDs taken and were ordered to meet with officials the next morning. Calls to the local police chief and other officials by an Associated Press journalist were unanswered. Officials continued to characterize the situation as a dispute between Buddhist sects. Nhat Hanh's followers insisted they would remain at Bat Nha and that they had no political agenda. Violence and eviction Early on September 27, 2009 an angry mob of police and apparent villagers broke windows and bashed in the doors of the monastery. The mob dragged about 150 monks from their rooms where they had been chanting and meditating, then beat them with sticks. The nuns were also beaten. A number of the monks and nuns were sexually assaulted by the mob. More than 30 of the monks were forced into buses which took them away. “Senior monks were dragged like animals out of their rooms, then left sitting in the rain until police dragged them to the taxis where ‘black society’ bad guys pushed them into cars,” a villager said during a phone interview. Two senior monks had their IDs taken and were put under house arrest without charges in their home towns. When contacted by the press later that day, local police denied that there had been an incident. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg was in Vietnam that day. During a press briefing he said he was aware of the incident and that he had “expressed our concern” to Vietnamese authorities. He said, “We look forward to getting more information from them about the situation.” That evening about 50 monks tried to reenter the monastery but were kept out. About 30 monks were still inside encircled by police. The next morning, September 28, 2009, about 230 nuns fled for Phuoc Hue monastery and Bat Nha was empty. Sister Dang Nghiem said “The Vietnamese government has won. Their ‘victory’ is that Bat Nha is completely destroyed. Everything is smashed.” When contacted by the press that morning the head of the provincial government, Huynh Duc Hoa, denied the incident and refused to answer questions. Refuge at Phuoc Hue monastery 376 of the monks and nuns took refuge at nearby Phuoc Hue monastery with the permission of officials of the official Vietnamese Buddhist Church. Police guarded the monastery around the clock. By September 30, 2009 a number of the monks had left under police pressure. Sister Dang Nghiem said, “They are using psychological tactics. They are trying to break them down one by one.” As of October 1, 2009 local officials were still not available to make comments to the press.

Her film Places in Cities was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. At the 69th Berlin International Film Festival, Schanelec won the Silver Bear for Best Director for her film I Was at Home, But. Biography Schanelec was born in Aalen, Baden-Württemberg, in Germany. Her artistic career began as an actress onstage; however, she is best known today for her career as a filmmaker, which began during her time at the Berlin Film and Television Academy (dffb). There, she studied under Harun Farocki and Hartmut Bitomsky, and met Christian Petzold and Thomas Arslan, with whom she comprised the so-called first wave of the Berlin School. During this time, she produced her thesis film, I Stayed in Berlin All Summer, a 47-minute featurette. Schanelec, Petzold and Arslan found support in the budding artistic scene of post-reunification Berlin, and in the production company Schramm Film, operated by Michael Weber and Florian Koerner von Gustorf. Since graduating from dffb, She has written and directed 6 features and contributed segments to the anthology films Bridges of Sarajevo and Germany 09: 13 Short Films About the State of the Nation. Critical reception Schanelec's films have premiered at numerous renowned film festivals, including the Cannes Film Festival, the Berlin International Film Festival, and the Toronto International Film Festival. Critics have generally embraced her cinematic style, which almost exclusively employs lengthy, static shots with little action and ambiguous emotional content, tenuously connected by a narrative. Marco Abel, a scholar of the Berlin School, argues that her films function through \\"affective images\\" which reach the viewer primarily through their visual content, mostly without requiring narrative context. She is frequently compared to several European avant-garde filmmakers, such as Chantal Akerman, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Robert Bresson, whom she has cited as an important influence. However, Derek Elley, writing for Variety, called Places in Cities a \\"joyless snoozer\\" and remarked that Schanelec's films \\"throw out no emotional lifelines for the viewer.\\" Selected filmography * The Death of the White Stallion (1985) * I Stayed in Berlin All Summer (1994) * My Sister's Good Fortune (1995) * Places in Cities (1998) * Passing Summer (2001) * Marseille (2004) * Afternoon (2007) * Germany 09: 13 Short Films About The State Of The Nation (2009) * Orly (2010) * Bridges of Sarajevo (2014) * The Dreamed Path (2016) * I Was at Home, But (2019) * Music (TBA) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century German actresses Category:21st- century German actresses Category:German film actresses Category:People from Aalen Category:Film people from Baden-Württemberg Category:Silver Bear for Best Director recipients ","title":"Angela Schanelec"},{"id":"24559792","text":"Katarina Srebotnik and Ai Sugiyama were the defending champions, but Sugiyama retired from the sport on October 2, 2009, and only Srebotnik competed that year.

It is a comedy about a man whose marriage begins to fail when his wife enlists. Plot TV writer Greg Whitcomb did his military service heroically but now has settled into everyday life with a young wife, Katy. A letter from the war department arrives that Katy believes is calling Greg back to active duty from the Air Force reserve, but she hides it during a party celebrating their wedding anniversary. A captain attending the party, Barney Sloan, casually calls Greg an \\"old-timer,\\" offending him. Greg gets drunk and passes out.

Trouble is, Greg flunks his physical exam due to a bad knee. Katy is shipped to a base in Hawaii without him. Female neighbors keep suggesting Katy will be lonely and surrounded by handsome servicemen, so Greg flies to Honolulu to join her. He ends up spending hours with the wives, a situation their husbands don't appreciate. Greg decides to sabotage Katy's career so she can get a discharge. His stunt backfires, but because Greg's knee has healed, he is now recalled up to duty. Which would be fine, except Katy now needs to be honorably discharged and sent home because she is pregnant.

The project originated in the fall of 1955, soon after North's breakthrough in How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955), a role intended for Monroe, but one she turned down. The studio attached popular director Frank Tashlin and comedian Tom Ewell (Monroe's leading man in The Seven Year Itch) to work alongside North, in an effort to ensure the film would be successful. Tashlin had the film's script tailored to fit North's talents, and molded his story along the lines of the popular romantic comedies of the era. The film was Buddy Adler's first film under his Fox contract. During production, the role of Sandra, the sultry upstairs neighbor, was intended for African-American actress Dorothy Dandridge. Two years earlier, Dandridge had achieved fame for her performance in Carmen Jones and her resulting Academy Award nomination. Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck was, at the time, in the process of gradually promoting Dandridge into being accepted by contemporary white audiences. Zanuck had assigned her the role in The Lieutenant Wore Skirts and that of Tuptim in the film version of The King and I, and was planning to cast her in modernized remakes of The Blue Angel and Under Two Flags. However, Otto Preminger, Dandridge's former director and now-lover, convinced her to turn down the supporting roles in The Lieutenant Wore Skirts and The King and I, insisting she was now above playing smaller roles since she had proven herself a box office star. As a result, Dandridge was replaced by Rita Moreno as Sandra and Tuptim, and her career started its slow, but steady decline.

With India being a country of chronic power deficits, the Government of India has planned to provide 'power for all' by the end of the eleventh plan.The capacity of thermal power is 1000 MW and above. This would entail the creation of an additional capacity of at least 100,000 Megawatts by 2012. The Ultra Mega Power Projects, each with a capacity of 4000 megawatts or above, are being developed with the aim of bridging this gap. The STPS were started by Government of India in the 1990s, but met with limited success. The Ministry of Power, in association with the Central Electricity Authority and Power Finance Corporation Ltd., has launched an initiative for the development of coal-based STPS's in India. These projects will be awarded to developers on the basis of competitive bidding. Ramagundam Super Thermal power station, one of the biggest thermal power stations in India, is a coal based power station situated at ramagundam in Karimnagar District. The station started power generation in 1983. The station generates about 2600 MW of power annually. The fuel for the power generation is taken from the South Godavari Coal Fields and water is taken from Pochampad Dam. The power generated from the power plant is shared by the south Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry.

It was established in the 18th century by a Jewish entrepreneur who settled in Wales. History The bank was founded by Samuel Levi Phillips, who arrived with his brother, Moses Levi Philips, in Haverfordwest in the middle of the eighteenth century. Their ancestral home was the city of Frankfurt-am-Main in Germany.https://biography.wales/article/s-PHIL-LEV-1730 Retrieved 3 October 2009 They adopted the surname Phillips, after being befriended by a gentleman of that name in Haverfordwest, and were baptized in St Mary's Church, Haverfordwest, in 1755/1756.Early Banks in West Wales, by Francis Green (in West Wales Historical Records, The Annual Magazine of The Historical Society of West Wales, Volume VI, edited by Francis Green, Printed by W.

History=Early years The history of Minyard Food Stores dates back to the 1930s. A.W. \\"Eck\\" Minyard, a postal employee, purchased a store at 6011 Lindsley Avenue in East Dallas for $1,200. His primary motivation for the purchase was to provide jobs for his two younger brothers, H.C. \\"Henry\\" and M.T. \\"Buddy\\" Minyard, who had just completed high school. At that time, the country was in the depths of the Great Depression and jobs were scarce. On February 12, 1932, the first Minyard Food Store opened around the corner from the Minyard family home. The clapboard store was in size. A.W. Minyard initially continued his job as a postal worker while running the store on Sundays. He would later quit the postal job to focus fully on the grocery business. His sister Fay and another brother, H.J. \\"Hap\\" Minyard had joined the others by the late 1930s. The store was successful enough to spawn the opening of another store and a convenience store by the close of the decade. When the United States entered World War II, the younger Minyard brothers joined the military. A.W. and Fay Minyard closed all of the stores with the exception of the original East Dallas location. After the war, a total of three new stores opened during the 1940s. Growth The 1950s were a decade of growth for Minyard stores. Six new stores were opened, including the first outside of Dallas County in McKinney in 1957. In 1959, the business opened its largest store to date in Lancaster. At , the Lancaster Minyard featured new technology such as mercury vapor lighting, a 200-car parking lot, automatic air-opened doors, background music, and air-conditioning. By 1960, the 11 Minyard Food Stores generated sales of $15 million. Additional sites were purchased for future expansion and in 1961, a complex on Cedar Springs Street in Dallas became the site of Minyard's central office and distribution operations. By the end of the 1960s, the company had a total of 16 stores. Rapid Expansion An additional 21 stores opened during the 1970s. By 1978, nine shopping centers were also owned by Minyard Properties, Inc. In 1979, a store opened in Mesquite that introduced bar codes and scanning to the chain. Plans for a new corporate headquarters were spearheaded by Bob and H.C. \\"Henry\\" Minyard. Henry, however, suffered a fatal heart attack on December 25, 1979 and didn't live to see the ground broken on the new complex. Bob Minyard was named president of the company. In August 1981, the corporate headquarters and distribution center moved to a facility in Coppell, between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. By its 50th anniversary in 1982, the company operated 53 stores. That same year, a new concept store, the Sack 'n Save Warehouse Food Store, was introduced. The store, located in Haltom City, offered products in bulk at reduced prices. This new concept was considered necessary to remain competitive in the grocery industry, which faced slow growth during the mid-1980s. In 1987, Minyard purchased 24 stores from Safeway Stores, Inc., which exited the Dallas-Fort Worth market. This boosted the company's presences in the area. A total of 12 stores were bought in Dallas County, nine in neighboring Tarrant County, and three in other counties. Minyard was able to reopen all 24 stores within a record five days. By the end of 1987, the company owned and operated 62 Minyard Food Stores and 10 Sack 'n Save stores. Less than a year after the major acquisition, Chairman and CEO M.T. \\"Buddy\\" Minyard died of a heart attack. Leadership of the company passed to his two daughters, Lisbeth \\"Liz\\" Minyard and Gretchen Minyard Williams and CEO J. L. \\"Sonny\\" Williams Increased competition Former Minyard Food Stores in Plano, Texas. In 1990, the company announced that it would open a new store format dedicated to the growing, mostly under-served minority population in ethnic neighborhoods. Operating under the name Carnival Food Stores, ethnic merchandise was offered in addition to traditional grocery products depending on the neighborhood it served. Three Carnival Food Stores opened in Fort Worth in the summer of 1990. Two catered to African Americans and one focused on Hispanic shoppers. The concept proved to be successful and Minyard announced plans to open four additional Carnival Food Stores by late 1991. A total of 21 Carnival stores were operating by the end of the decade. The 1990s were a period of increased competition in the Dallas-Fort Worth area grocery market. In addition to longtime competitors such as Kroger and Tom Thumb, new chains were also entering the market. The most notable entrant was North Carolina- based Food Lion, which planned on opening 50 stores in the area. Minyard focused on improving customer service to deal with the growing competition. Store expansion slowed, although new stores were opened in strategic locations. By the mid-1990s, the company had managed to survive the stiff challenges from other chains. Food Lion began closing stores in 1994 and exited Texas in 1997. In 1996, Minyard was the third-largest grocery chain in Dallas-Fort Worth, behind Tom Thumb and Albertsons. In January 1997, the company entered into the gasoline business by opening two gas stations adjacent to two Minyard supermarkets in Dallas. By the end of 1999, the number of Minyard-owned gas stations had risen to twelve. Throughout Minyard's Food Store existence Minyard's would sponsor all local sports team in fact former CEO Sonny Williams and Gretchen Minyard Williams was longtime owner of the Dallas Sidekicks (1984-2004) from 1996-2004. On October 29, 2004, after 72 years in business, the Minyard family sold Minyard Food Stores, Inc. to Acquisition Vehicle Texas II, LLC, an investment company conducting business under name Minyard Group. Q Investments, the ultimate owner of Minyard, began selling off the stores slowly. With its market share declining due to pressure from larger chains (such as Walmart putting full grocery stores in their Walmart Super Centers, and Target and Kmart doing the same), Minyard sold its 37 Carnival stores to a group including Houston-based Fiesta Mart, Inc. in 2008. Minyard also closed or sold its Sack N Save stores to independent operators: the last one (in Denton) would close and the property sold to the University of North Texas. In May 2011, 10 Minyard locations were acquired by RLS Supermarkets of Carrollton. RLS kept the Minyard name on all of them; the locations included Dallas, Duncanville, Balch Springs, Fort Worth, Irving, Lancaster, and Mesquite. In late 2014, Minyard purchased stores from Albertson's and Tom Thumb as part of anti-trust settlements resulting from Albertson's merger with Safeway (Tom Thumb's corporate parent).http://www.albertsons.com/albertsons-safeway-confirm-agreements-to- sell-168-stores-in-eight-states-to-four-buyers/ Closure of Brand In July 2016 Minyard announced the sale of all Minyard-label stores and two Sun Fresh Market stores to Fiesta Mart. The remaining Sun Fresh Market stores would be operated by RLS, but the sale resulted in the Minyard name disappearing from the DFW landscape with the exception of a single store which operated until August 17, 2017 which ended the 85-year old Minyard chain.

Background Ó Taidg was a descendant of King Tadg mac Cathal of Connacht (reigned 925–956), and was thus distant related to the Ua Conchobair (O'Conor) ruling dynasty. His family were one of a number of septs of the Síol Muireadaigh, which included clans such as Geraghty (Mac Airechtaig), Moran, Flanagan, Mulrooney, and MacDermot. Two early members of the family are listed in the Annals of the Four Masters sub anno 965 and 1048: * 965: The battle of Formaeil, at Rath-beg, was gained by the Cinel-Eoghain over the Cinel-Conaill, where Maelisa Ua Canannain, lord of Cinel-Conaill, and Muircheartach Ua- Taidhg, royal heir to Connaught, were slain, together with many others. * 1048: A predatory excursion was made by the royal heirs or chieftains of Ui Maine into Delbhna, where the royal chieftains were all slain, namely, Ua Maelruanaidh, Ua Flannagain, An Cleireach Ua Taidhg, and Mac Buadhachain, royal heir of Dealbhna Nuadhat. The Ó Taidg family ruled an area in mid-County Galway, which was called Clann Taidg after them. It appears to have come into existence during a wave of expansion by the Uí Briúin in the middle decades of the 10th century. Previously part of Uí Briúin Seóla, the Ó Taidg's are believed to have become its lords sometime in the mid-12th century. By 1241 much of the area was seized by Meyler de Bermingham, who made Athenry the seat of his lordship. An Teaghlaigh By the early 12th century the family added the suffix an Teaghlaigh to their surname. It derived from the fact that the family were household chiefs and bodyguards of the Kings of Connacht. The earliest record of the term occurred in 1132, when > The castle of Bun-Gaillmhe (Galway) was burned and demolished by a fleet of > the men of Munster; and a great slaughter was made of the people of West > Connaught, together with Ua Taidhg an Teaghlaigh, and many other noblemen. King Cathal Fearghal's lord and king was Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair, who fought for the kingship of Connacht from the 1180s, succeeding in becoming undisputed king in 1202. As both his bodyguard and chief of his household – much like a royal Marshal such as John Marshal (c. 1105–1165) – Feargal would have been at Cathal's side for many years, especially when on campaign. The war of 1225 Cathal died in 1224, and succeeded by his son Aedh who was almost immediately beset with problems. Donn Óge Mag Oireachtaigh had been deprived of his lands by Aedh, and now sought the help of Domnall Óg Ó Néill of Tír Eógain. In 1225 Ó Néill invaded and set up a new king. Only a few of the Síol Muiredaig namely, Mac Dermot, David O'Flynn, &. stayed loyal to Aedh. Aedh then resolved to repair to the English to the Court of Athlone; for it happened, fortunately for him, that the chiefs of the English of Ireland were at that very time assembled there, and the greater part of them were friendly to him, on his father's account as well as on his own, for both had paid them wages for military services, and had been bountiful towards them. The English received him with joy, and kept him among them with much affection for some time afterwards. He then engaged in his cause the Lord Justice, and as many of the chiefs of the English of Ireland as he considered necessary, together with Donough Cairbreach O'Brien, and O'Melaghlin, with their forces. In the warfare that followed engagements occurred all over Connacht, from Turlough in County Mayo to Meelick in County Galway. Coolcarney was plundered, after which some of its people fled to Duvconga, but the greater part of these were drowned; and the baskets of the fishing weirs were found full of drowned children. Restoration and the death of Niall Aedh was eventually restored, but the price was giving to the English the chiefs of his people, as hostages for the payment of their wages, as Flaherty, O'Flanagan, Farrell O'Teige (i.e., Fearghal) and others of the chiefs of Connaught, who were subsequently obliged to ransom themselves. No sooner had the English left than the sons of Ruaidri O Connor rose up in revolt again. In the subsequent Battle of Ardrahan Niall, the son of Farrell O'Teige, and others, were slain; but the man who slew Niall O'Teige, i.e. the brother of Colen O'Dempsey, was slain himself also. Eventually, a truce was declared, of which the annals say > This was a necessary tranquillity, for there was not a church or territory > in Connaught at that time that had not been plundered and desolated. An > oppressive malady raged in the province of Connaught at this time: it was a > heavy burning sickness, which left the large towns desolate, without a > single survivor. Death Despite this, warfare continued again next year. Fearghal was killed in County Sligo by Donslevy O'Gara, who had been forced to make peace with King Aedh the year before. King Aedh was killed in 1228 and succeeded by his cousin, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair. Descendants Of Fearghal's family there are few notices in the subsequent annals. A bald statement for 1251 state Muiredach O Taidc died.. In 1429 it was noted that Melaghlin, son of Conor Anabaidh O'Kelly, who was the son of the Lord of Hy-Many, was slain with one cast of a javelin, by John Cam O'Teige, one of O'Conor's people. After this, the family fade from history.

In this incarnation of the famous bear, he is a full bodied bear; Free from the puppeteer's hand.  Setting and location  The gang live in the Fanshawe Theatre in an unknown English coastal town. The four embark on their adventures through a trapdoor located on the theatre's main stage which would take them to various places and times. However more often than not the trapdoor fails to send them to their desired location.  Main Characters  Sooty - A quiet and smart bear who is the undisputed leader of the gang. Sooty is the only character in the show that does not talk. And being a mute bear finds communication difficult but often gets what he is trying to say across to the rest of the cast. He wears a pair of bright red dungarees with two yellow buttons. And usually saves his friends with his trusty magic wand which he is only permitted to use once per adventure. Sweep (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - Now being able to speak with a rather groany sort of voice rather than the 'squeak' he is so well known for. Sweep is not the brainiest of the bunch and often thinks of nothing else than food which often involves 'sausages'. A rather cowardly canine, he never usually hangs around when danger is near. He wears green and blue dungarees and a red collar. Soo (voiced by Susie Blake) - A female panda with an attitude who does not stand for any of the mischief the other two usually get themselves into. Soo could be seen as the sensible one who whips the others into some kind of organisation. She wears a blue dress with a yellow flower on it and white underpants. Little Cousin Scampi (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - The smallest and youngest of the gang, and Sooty's little cousin too. If mischief has been aroused, it is most probably this little bear who has orchestrated it. Little Cousin Scampi appears in a schoolboy outfit.  Other Characters  Katarina (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - A well spoken Persian cat who does not believe any of the gang's adventures down the trapdoor. She wears a pink velvet coat and a pink fedora with a feather on the top. Captain Fogbound (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - A ginger cat who pilots a hot air balloon and is courting Katarina. He wears an aviator hat, a dark green leather coat and a pair of brown gloves. Cousin McScampi (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - Scampi's Scottish cousin, who is even worse at bagpipe playing than Scampi is, and wants to find the Loch Ness Monster. The Aliens (voiced by Rob Rackstraw and Jimmy Hibbert) - Two aliens from the planet Alpha Romeo who become friends with the gang after Sooty saves their spaceship from crashing into the theatre. Morris the Mouse (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - A male mouse who lives in the skirting boards of the attic that Sooty and the gang live in. He formerly lived behind the skirting boards of the stage, where he had hibernated since the Victorian era, and woke up because he was hungry for some cheese. He is normally very shy, but he sometimes comes along on the gang's adventures. Morris is not to be confused with the field mouse character with the same name from Muffin The Mule. Sir Ray Fanshawe (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - The former owner of the Fanshawe Theatre, who was buried alive underneath a mountain of sausages. He wears a purple fedora with a feather on the top, a Shakespearean ruff, and a purple Elizabethan shirt. Captain Neecap (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - A villainous Frenchman who owns both a submarine and a drilling machine. He is often hatching schemes to kidnap Sooty and the gang.  Rumoured destruction of master recordings and Archival status  In 2014, Richard Cadell claimed in an interview that when he acquired the rights to Sooty from HIT Entertainment in 2008, he received much archived Sooty material in the process. Said materials included the master tapes to the Sooty's Amazing Adventures series, which he destroyed out of personal distaste for the series. Cadell has since been approached by many other outside sources with the idea, and also attempt, of producing an animated CGI version of Sooty, but he does not want such a series to be made. However, it is just a myth, and the entire series still exists in the ITV Archive, even though ITV themselves do not currently own the rights to the series. The BFI National Archive also hold four episodes of the series recorded from their original broadcasts on VHS, and there were two commercial VHS releases of the series in 1997 and 1999.

Risks  Located some from the Boso triple junction, Tokyo is subject to quakes and tsunamis generated from slips along this junction. Furthermore, there is a large populated region along the coast of the main island that would also be subject to damage. This junction probably has the highest associated insurance risk in the world, due to its proximity to extensive urban development.

He was a pioneer in what is today called \\"Lean management,\\" but whose work has been forgotten. Frank George Woollard, ca. 1954. Source: David Bramley Archive. Used with permission. Biography Woollard is regarded as one of the fathers of the British motor industry for his major contributions to flow production, progressive management practices, and industrial automation. In 1918, Woollard was awarded Member of Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his work on in improving the design and production of tank gearboxes, which had been the bottleneck in tank production during World War I. Woollard's innovative work at Morris Engines Limited, later known as Morris engines branch, beginning in 1923, enabled Morris Motors Limited to grow rapidly and achieve a commanding 34 percent domestic market share by 1930. Born in London, England, his father George was a butler and his mother Emily (Powell) was a kitchen maid, Woollard was educated at City of London School where he excelled in mathematics and science. In 1914, Woollard married Catherine Elizabeth Richards, and they gave birth to a son who died in infancy and daughter Joan Elizabeth on 20 September 1916. Miss Joan Woollard died on 30 January 2008. Professional career Upon completing his education at City of London School, Woollard apprenticed for five years as a mechanical engineer at the London and South Western Railway starting in 1899. His first experience with a basic form of flow production was in the manufacture of railway coaches in 1904. Around 1905 he entered the British automotive industry as an auto parts designer. In 1910 he joined E G Wrigley & Co Limited, Birmingham, a maker of gear boxes, axles, and steering components for various British automobile companies, as chief draftsman in a department with a professional staff of 18, then in 1914 Woollard assumed responsibilities as production engineer. He re-organized production from batch to a simple form of flow to meet increased orders for vehicle components. In January 1918 he was appointed assistant managing director of Wrigley's.Wheels of Industry, The Commercial Motor, 31 January 1918, page 4 W R Morris, later Lord Nuffield, founder and owner of Morris Motors, became acquainted with Woollard as a customer of E G Wrigley & Co. Morris recognised Woollard's talents in automobile parts design and production and when Morris purchased the E G Wrigley business in January 1923 he appointed Woollard general manager of Morris Engines Limited. Woollard, with William Morris's encouragement and financial backing, immediately led the re-organization of engine production from batch to flow, increasing output from less than 300 units per week in January 1923, to 600 units per week by December 1923, and to 1200 units by December 1924. To achieve this remarkable increase in output, Woollard developed an advanced flow production system for low volume production. The major changes in production system design took place quickly, over a period of less than two years. In comparison, reorganisation of Toyota's engine shop, some 25 years later in the 1950s, took six years – and at half the production volume of Morris Motors. In 1926 Woollard joined the main board of Morris Motors but following disagreements with W R Morris who kept a firm grip on policy he moved on to managing director of Rudge-Whitworth in 1932. From 1936 he seemed unable to find employment with the major vehicle manufacturers but he returned to writing, took up some industry directorships and became active at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham College of Technology. He chaired the College of Technology's industrial administration group from 1951 to 1957.Wayne Lewchuk, Woollard, Frank George (1883–1957), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 His innovative methods seemed little appreciated by the industry though he was active and it would seem respected in his professional associations which included: :IAE President 1945–1947 of the Institution of Automobile Engineers – which he had joined in 1915 :IME first chairman, automobile division of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers – he arranged the merger of IAE and IME in 1947 :Member of the Institution of Production Engineers :Chairman executive committee of the Aluminium Development Association 1949–1952 :Chairman Zinc Alloy Diecasting Association 1952–1956 :founding member of British Institute of Management :Member of the American Society of Automotive Engineers He died of heart failure in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham on 22 December 1957. Woollard's flow production system was remarkably similar to current-day Lean production, and used most features of today's Lean production system methods and processes. This included (using current terminology): U-shaped cells, multi-skilled workers, takt time, standardised work, Just-In-Time, supermarkets, autonomation, quick change-over, etc. As a result, Woollard was able to prove, prior to Toyota, that achieving flow in lower volume production resulted in costs that were as low or lower than that which could be achieved by Ford's large scale production system. He was also the first to develop mechanical materials handling equipment known as automatic transfer machines to facilitate flow production, which some 25 years later would become common in the global automotive industry. Overall, Woollard's contribution to progressive manufacturing management practices is substantial and comparable to Taiichi Ohno at Toyota. He was a great early 20th century pioneer in progressive management, flow production, and industrial automation. Significance of Woollard's work Woollard's application of flow production beginning in 1923 means that timelines for discoveries and attributions of key accomplishments in Lean management must be revised. For example, Kiichiro Toyoda is credited with creating Just-in-Time (JIT) production in 1937, while Taiichi Ohno is credited with inventing \\"supermarkets\\" in 1953 to supply downstream processes. These innovations were established and used in flow production by Woollard between 1923 and 1925. Other innovations, such as autonomation, appear to have been discovered independently by Sakichi Toyoda and Frank Woollard. Woollard's work is important because he was not a technocrat solely interested in using new machines to replace men and increase productive output. He warned people that flow is the objective, and machinery can be helpful but is not necessary to achieve it. He also warned against falling in love with machinery for its own sake. Woollard viewed factory workers as part of the production system, not separate from it, and gave them responsibilities that normally would have been handled by supervisors. He also allowed workers to participate in efforts to improve production processes which was innovative for its time, but was rudimentary and more limited compared to Toyota's systematic development of workers capabilities post-World War II. Further, Woollard understood that achieving flow in production activities alone was not enough; management and workers must work to connect all processes, from beginning to end, to achieve flow throughout the enterprise. Woollard clearly understood the idea and practice of continuous improvement in a flow environment, saying: “the virtue of flow production lies in the fact that it brings all inconsistencies into the light of day and so provides the opportunity for correcting them,” and “[the] high visibility conferred on the company's activities by flow production will lead to unceasing and continuous improvement\\" (Woollard, 1954, p. 87). Additionally, Woollard understood that to achieve flow production, management practice had to be non-zero-sum, meaning that workers had to be respected and also benefit from flow production, in addition to customers. He recognised that in order for flow to exist, the interests of key stakeholders cannot be marginalised. Flow must cause no harm; if it does, then material and information will not flow. Woollard understood and practised what today we call \\"Continuous Improvement\\" and \\"Respect for People\\" – the two principles of Lean management, and embodied them in his 18 principles of flow production (Woollard, 1954, p. 51). Woollard's work in flow production in the mid-to-late 1920s pre-dates Kiichiro Toyoda's interest in flow production by nearly 15 years. It is notable that Woollard's work was well publicised in technical automotive production and engineering journals. Papers written by Woollard and William Morris showed their strong desire to share the details of their innovative continuous flow production system with others and to showcase British industrial prowess. Their work was no secret and was readily available to anyone interested in learning about advanced automobile production methods. Woollard's legacy Woollard wrote numerous journal papers and trade magazine articles on his flow production system in the mid-1920 and into the late 1940s and mid-1950s. His detailed technical papers were published in a widely read journal called Machinery. Those papers, as well as his 1954 book, Principles of Mass and Flow Production, fell into obscurity for reasons that are not at all clear. Woollard is the forgotten pioneer of Lean management. His work is completely missing from the Lean management literature and highlights a significant failure on the part of both Lean management researchers and production and operations management researchers. Woollard died in late 1957, and so did his life's work. His daughter Joan was an accomplished artist and apparently did not have the capability to keep her father's work alive. Woollard's colleagues had tremendous admiration for him and his accomplishments, but they would eventually pass away and nobody carried his work forward until recently. Woollard's work has been revived by Lean management historian and author Professor Bob Emiliani. In January 2009 he published a 55th Anniversary Special Edition of Woollard's 1954 book, Principles of Mass and Flow Production, which also includes his 1925 paper \\"Some Notes on British Methods of Continuous Production\\" and commentary and analysis of Woollard's work by Dr. Emiliani. Morris Motors Ltd. ceased to exist in 1952 when it merged with Austin Motor Company, Ltd. to form British Motor Corporation. Unfortunately, innovations in production methods and machinery are not sufficient to ensure long-term company success. Managers and employees must excel at many other business processes including responding to the voice of the customer with new designs, short cycle-time product development, introducing new automotive technologies, aftermarket service, and so on. An advanced production system alone will not make a company successful long-term.

Sextortion refers to the broad category of sexual exploitation in which abuse of power is the means of coercion, as well as to the category of sexual exploitation in which threatened release of sexual images or information is the means of coercion. As used to describe an abuse of power, sextortion is a form of corruption in which people entrusted with power – such as government officials, judges, educators, law enforcement personnel, and employers – seek to extort sexual favors in exchange for something within their authority to grant or withhold. Examples of such abuses of power include: government officials who request sexual favors to obtain licenses or permits, teachers who trade good grades for sex with students, and employers who make providing sexual favors a condition of obtaining a job. Sextortion also refers to a form of blackmail in which sexual information or images are used to extort sexual favors from the victim. Social media and text messages are often the source of the sexual material and the threatened means of sharing it with others. An example of this type of sextortion is where people are extorted with a nude image of themselves they shared on the Internet through sexting. They are later coerced into performing sexual acts with the person doing the extorting or are coerced into posing or performing sexually on camera, thus producing hardcore pornography. This method of blackmail is also frequently used to outing LGBT people who keep their true sexual orientation private. A video highlighting the dangers of sextortion has been released by the National Crime Agency in the UK to educate people, especially given the fact that blackmail of a sexual nature may cause humiliation to a sufficient extent to cause the victim to take their own life, in addition to other efforts to educate the public on the risks of sextortion. Webcam blackmail Sextortion through the use of webcams is also a concern, especially for those who use webcams for flirting and cybersex. Often this involves a cybercriminal posing as someone else – such as an attractive person – initiating communication of a sexual nature with the victim (about 95% of victims are male). Often, the cybercriminal simply shows the victim a pre- recorded video of a performer from a cybersex webcam site which they are sufficiently familiar with, then messages the victim at points in the video where the performer appears to be typing on the keyboard, to give the illusion that the performer in the video is messaging them. The victim is then persuaded to undress in front of a webcam, and may also be persuaded to engage in sexual behaviour, such as masturbation. The video is recorded by the cybercriminal, who then reveals their true intent and demands money or other services (such as more explicit images of the victim, in cases of online predation), and threatening to publicly release the video to video services like YouTube and send it to family members and friends of the victim if they do not comply. Sometimes threats to make false allegations of paedophilia against the victim are made as well. This is known as webcam blackmail. An increase in webcam blackmails have been reported, and it affects both young and old, male and female alike. Webcam blackmail is also connected with webcam trolling. History An early use of the term appears in print in 1950 in California. Since early 2009, The Institute for Responsible Online and Cell- Phone Communication (iroc2.org) began warning the public about the trend of \\"Sextortion\\" via live events and websites including www.sextortion.org. This is a trend that grew based on the birth and growth of the trend known as \\"sexting\\" whereby compromising images and videos were being shared by individuals without a real understanding of the short and long term consequences of sharing \\"private' content on digital tools designed for sharing. In 2009, the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ), in partnership with the Association of Women Judges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Philippine Women Judges Association, and the Tanzania Women Judges Association, and with funding from the Government of the Netherlands, launched a three-year program on \\"Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion.\\" Presentations on sextortion were made to judges attending the 2010 and 2012 Biennial World Conferences of the IAWJ and to NGOs attending the 2011 and 2012 meetings of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. There are also scientific studies describing the prevalence of sextortion in Europe, etc. in the Czech Republic (2017). In China sextortion is institutionalized as part of predatory lending to students. Incidents Incidents of sextortion have been prosecuted under various criminal statutes, including as extortion, bribery, breach of trust, corruption, sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, sexual assault, child pornography, () and computer hacking and wiretapping. *Anthony Stancl of Wisconsin, then 18, received 15 years in prison in February 2010 after he posed as a girl on Facebook to trick male high school classmates into sending him nude cell phone photos, which he then used to extort them for homosexual sex. *Jonathan Vance of Auburn, Alabama was sentenced to 18 years in prison in April 2010 after sending threatening e-mails on Facebook and MySpace extorting nude photos from more than 50 women in three states. *Luis Mijangos was sentenced to six years in prison in September 2011 for hacking into dozens of computers, stealing personal information and demanding naked images from female victims in exchange for not releasing the stolen information.

(25 December 1696 – 1 August 1715) was a German prince, son by his second marriage of Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Despite his early death he is remembered as a collector and commissioner of music and as a composer, some of whose concertos were arranged for harpsichord or organ by Johann Sebastian Bach, who was court organist in Weimar at the time.http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Ernst-Johann.htm Life Johann Ernst was born in Weimar, the fourth son and sixth child of Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and second child of the Duke's second wife, Charlotte Dorothea Sophia of Hesse-Homburg. As a young child the prince took violin lessons from G.C. Eilenstein, who was a court musician.Sarah E. Hanks, \\"Johann Ernst, Prince of Weimar\\", In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14348 (accessed October 29, 2009). He studied at the University of Utrecht between February 1711 and July 1713. It is thought that Johann Ernst furthered his understanding of music at this time. From Utrecht, he could visit such centres as Amsterdam and Düsseldorf and it is known that he had copies of Italian music sent back to Weimar. (Household bills for the year from 1 June following his return record the cost of copying, binding and shelving music.) In particular, it is thought that he might have encountered Vivaldi's opus 3 set of violin concertos. The prince's interest in collecting music was sufficiently well known that P. D. Kräuter, when requesting leave of absence to study with Bach in Weimar, mentioned the French and Italian music that the prince was expected to introduce there. Kräuter also praised Johann Ernst's virtuosity as a violinist.Peter F. Williams (1980)The Organ Music of J.S. Bach I: BWV 525-598, 802-805 etc., Cambridge University Press pp.283-5 On his return from university, Johann Ernst took lessons in composition with a focus on concertos from the local church organist Johann Gottfried Walther, a cousin of Bach. Walther had previously given the prince keyboard lessons and had given him his Praecepta der musikalischen Composition (Precepts of Musical Composition) as a twelfth birthday present. During his life, Walther transcribed seventy-eight concertos for keyboard. Bach also produced a number of virtuoso organ (BWV 592-6) and harpsichord (BWV 972-987) arrangements. These included some of the prince's own works (BWV 592, 592a, 595, 982, 984 and 987) as well as works by German and Italian composers, including Georg Philipp Telemann (BWV 985) and Vivaldi (BWV 972, 973 etc.). The Bach transcriptions were created roughly during the period July 1713-July 1714 between Johann Ernst's return from Utrecht and the prince's final departure from Weimar. There is some scholarly debate on Johann Ernst's role in the creation of these arrangements, whether he commissioned some from one or both of the musicians or whether Bach, in particular, was studying some of the works collected by the prince for their own sake. There are suggestions that on a visit to Amsterdam in February 1713 the Prince may have heard the blind organist J. J. de Graff, who is known to have played keyboard arrangements of other composers' concertos. In any case, Bach's encounter with the prince's collection, and especially the Italian music it contained, had a profound influence on the development of the composer's musical style. John Butt, The Cambridge Companion to Bach p.141. As well as influencing Bach, Johann Ernst completed at least nineteen instrumental works of his own before his death at age eighteen. These works show the influence of Italian music more than that of German models such as Bach.John Greene Review of Haenssler Classic CD98.408. Classics Today.com Johann Ernst died in Frankfurt after a long illness resulting from a leg infection, possibly a metastatic sarcoma, which, despite the intensive care of his heart-broken mother and medical treatments in Schwalbach, spread to the abdominal area. He was buried, not in Weimar, but in Homburg (Bad Homburg vor der Höhe) in the vault of his mother's family, the Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg.Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste, 1842 A period of mourning was declared in Weimar from 11 August to 9 November 1715. Music was banned, including in church, resulting in an interruption in Bach's attempt to build an annual cycle of cantatas.Christoph Wolff et al.Biography of Bach , Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Following his death, six of the prince's concertos were sent to Telemann, who edited and published them in 1718.Information on recording - BACH, J.S.: Organ Transcriptions Naxos Classics UPC: 730099593625, Naxos Records He himself had already started to have them set before his death. Telemann's own first publication, a 1715 set of six violin sonatas, had been dedicated to Johann Ernst. Compositions According to Walther's Lexicon, published in 1732, Johann Ernst composed 19 instrumental pieces in a period of nine months, shortly before his death, when Walther was teaching him composition.Johann Gottfried Walther Musicalisches Lexicon oder Musicalische Bibliothec. Leipzig: W. Deer, 1732, p. 331 Eight violin concertos are extant in their original instrumentation. Bach transcribed three of these: Op. 1 Nos. 1 and 4 and the Concerto a 8 in G major. Another concerto by Johann Ernst is only known through Bach's transcriptions in C major. No original has been identified for BWV 983: it was possibly transcribed by Bach from a concerto by Johann Ernst. The model for BWV 977 is equally lost: also in this case a possible attribution of the lost original to Johann Ernst is uncertain.

The archdeaconry includes seven deaneries. History Three archdeacons were appointed in what was then the Diocese of Wells during the time at which archdeacons were first appointed across the Church of England, not long after the Norman Conquest in 1077. The earliest archdeacons of the Taunton area occur with the title \\"Archdeacon beyond the Parrett\\", until the title \\"Archdeacon of Taunton\\" occurs, around the time the diocese was renamed to Bath in 1090. That name persisted for around a century until the see was moved again in 1197 and became called the Diocese of Bath and Glastonbury; in 1219 the name was returned to Diocese of Bath. The diocese's name was finally settled at Bath and Wells and both the diocese's and the archdeaconry's names have remained stable for the 800 years since.

Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246.), formally the Prince of Chen (陳王), was an imperial prince of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving briefly as Crown Prince during the reign of his uncle Emperor Wenzong. Background It is not known exactly when Li Chengmei was born, but his older brother Li Pu was born in 824,Old Book of Tang, vol. 175. and their father Emperor Jingzong was assassinated around new year 827,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. placing a timeframe for his birth. His mother's identity is lost to history. He was the youngest son of Emperor Jingzong's.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246.The biographies of Li Chengmei and his brothers in the Old Book of Tang lists him as the youngest of five sons of Emperor Jingzong's; however, Emperor Wenzong's edict creating him crown prince, quoted in the same biographies, referred to him as Emperor Jingzong's sixth son. Presumably there was a son of Emperor Jingzong's who died in infancy whose identity was lost. In 837, Emperor Jingzong's younger brother, then-reigning Emperor Wenzong, created Li Chengmei and three of his brothers imperial princes (Li Pu was deceased at that point), and Li Chengmei received the title of Prince of Chen.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. Death In 839, after Emperor Wenzong, who was sonless at that point — with his own son and crown prince Li Yong having died in 838 — was considering whom to make crown prince. His favorite concubine Consort Yang was urging him to create his younger brother Li Rong the Prince of An crown prince. When Emperor Wenzong requested the opinions of the chancellors, Li Jue opposed. As a result, Emperor Wenzong decided to create Li Chengmei crown prince. By spring 840, Emperor Wenzong was seriously ill. He had his trusted eunuchs Liu Hongyi (劉弘逸) and Xue Jileng (薛季稜) summon the chancellors Li Jue and Yang Sifu to the palace, intending to entrust Li Chengmei to them. However, the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (魚弘志), who controlled the palace by that point, opposed Li Chengmei because they were not consulted before Emperor Wenzong created Li Chengmei crown prince. Despite Li Jue's opposition, they issued an edict in Emperor Wenzong's name demoting Li Chengmei back to Prince of Chen (under the excuse that Li Chengmei was too young) and creating another brother of Emperor Wenzong's, Li Chan the Prince of Ying crown prince. Emperor Wenzong soon died, and after Emperor Wenzong's death, Chou persuaded Li Chan to order Li Chengmei, as well as Consort Yang and Li Rong, to commit suicide. Despite Li Chengmei's relative young age, he had at least 19 sons, and his 19th son, Li Yan (李儼), was later created an imperial prince. Was Li Yan son of Chengmei? In Qing Dynasty, a scholar named Shen Bingzhen(沈炳震) cited some sentences from New Book of Tang that doubted whether Li Yan was the 19th son of Chengmei. In the opinion of New Book, Chengmei was too young to have 19 sons; Li Yan was created Prince of Xuancheng(宣城郡王) only one year after Chengmei was created Prince of Chen. Old Book of Tang referred Li Yan as \\"the 19th son of Prince of Chen\\", so Shen thought \\"Prince of Chen\\" here referred to the former prince Li Gui(李珪), the 19th son of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, thus Li Yan was indeed the 19th son of Li Gui. However, in the view of Shen, this was also under doubt, for it was too late for a grandson of Xuanzong to be created a prince.

The national team is seeing a resurgence, and played its first game in recent years on 4 October 2014 against Estonia, which resulted in a 58-12 defeat; a promising result against a well-established team. Leonid Zelenkevich, playing in the second row, brought some much needed experience to the team, having spent the last nine years playing for various clubs in England. It is reported that the national team has some fixtures in 2015, in which they hope to cement their reputation as up-and-coming contenders in the Eastern European circuit.

His engineering skills were used extensively by producer Leslie Kong, and he eventually moved into production himself, using an Ampex two-track mixing board to create remixes of tracks and to combine several tracks into a single song. He also founded the Upset record label in 1967 along with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and trainee engineer Barrington Lambert. His self-productions included \\"Pop a Top\\", which he described as the first ever Jamaican \\"talking\\" record (although a handful of deejay records had been released earlier), which at the time of its release in early 1968 was unusual in that its rhythm was noticeably faster than the prevailing rocksteady beat. \\"Pop a Top\\"'s rhythm track was based on Dave Bartholomew's \\"South Parkway Mambo\\", and its lyric was based on a Canada Dry commercial; The song was later used by Canada Dry in an advertising campaign in the 1970s.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 51 The line \\"taste the tits, taste the tits\\" caused controversy when it was played by John Peel on his BBC Radio 1 show, with the BBC receiving a number of complaints. He further contributed to the development of reggae later in 1968 when he worked with Perry on \\"People Funny Boy\\", which had a rhythm based on music that Anderson and Perry had heard at a Pocomania church service the night before.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn., Rough Guides, , p. 87, 91 Anderson has been described as one of the most gifted recording engineers ever to work in Jamaica, and was described by Winston Holness as \\"the greatest engineer at those times...a genius in the business\\". He worked for several years for Byron Lee at his Dynamic Sounds studio, working on recordings including the backing track to Roberta Flack's \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\", and on recordings by The Wailers. He stated in the 1990s that during that period he would record or master up to 100 songs a day. He also recorded for Lee himself, including the 1970 single \\"The Law\\". In 1970, Anderson mixed the first truly multitrack dubs at Dynamic Sounds.Shepherd, John (2003) Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume 2 - Production and Performance, Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., , p. 131 He also co-produced the Byron Lee & the Dragonaires album Reggay Blast Off the same year. In 1977, Anderson emigrated to New York City, where he eventually landed a position as an audio engineer for the United Nations. He retired to Charlotte, North Carolina in 2004.

It was the first independent native student organization, and one of the first native organizations to use direct action protests as a means to pursue its goals. During the 1960s, NIYC acted primarily as a civil rights organization. It was very active in the movement to preserve tribal fishing rights in the Northwest. In the 1970s NIYC focused on environmental concerns and aided tribes suffering from the adverse effects of contamination from coal strip mining and uranium mining. The NIYC seeks to improve public education and job training for Native Americans, educate the general public about their issues, promote religious freedom, and increase political participation.Utter, Jack (2001). American Indians: History to Today's Questions (Second ed.), p.335. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman. . The Preamble to the NIYC's Constitution and Statement of Purpose reads:  History  The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was established in 1961 by young American Indians who were either in college or had recently graduated. The NIYC is a result of youths dissenting from tribal leaders, which began during the American Indian Chicago Conference in 1961, where several young American Indians, a handful of who had become acquainted while participating in the Southwest Regional Indian Youth Council, became disillusioned with the tribal leaders.[1]:53-54. After listening to the ideas presented by the conservative faction of the conference, the youth began to express dissenting opinions. This group, including Clyde Warrior (Ponca) and Mel Thom (Walker River Paiute), temporarily called themselves the Chicago Conference Youth Council.[1]:57. Later in the year, after that summer's Workshop on American Indian Affairs had ended, the group that had joined together as the Chicago Conference Youth Council met in Gallup, New Mexico.[5] It was there that the National Indian Youth Council was established. The NIYC is the second oldest national Indian organization and was influenced and aligned with the Civil Rights Movement.  Goals  The goal of NIYC is to protect Indian treaty, hunting, and fishing rights. Mel Thom developed the following creed from which many ideas were drawn and used in the preamble of the NIYC's constitution: After the founding of the NIYC, the group decided to take the fight for Native American rights in a new direction and use direct action to solve problems. Direct actions included fish-ins and protest marches. This inspired other organizations to do the same, such as the American Indian Movement.[6]:2 Publications In 1963, NIYC began publishing a monthly newsletter titled ABC: Americans Before Columbus. This was the first publication of the Red Power movement. The newsletter was one of the leading expressions of radical Indian thought. By 1962, over 180 tribal councils had subscribed.Fluharty, Sterling. \\"National Indian Youth Council\\" , New Mexico Office of the State Historian, 2009. Retrieved on 2009-10-04. \\\\ Red Power era National Indian Youth Council demonstrations, Bureau of Indian Affairs office, Denver 1970 Fish-Ins As soon as settlers began arriving to the Columbia River area, they began to challenge Indian tribes over fishing. During the 1800s, numerous regional tribes ceded quantities of land to the federal government and moved to reservations, but their treaties protected traditional fishing and hunting, both in terms of access to territories and in the means used. The Muckleshoot, Puyallup, Nisqually, and other tribes of the Pacific Northwest signed the Treaty of Point Elliot and the Treaty of Medicine Creek related to these issues.Shreve, Bradley Glenn. \\"Red Power Rising: The National Indian Youth Council and the Origins of Intertribal Activism.\\" Diss. U of Mexico, 2007. But, after WWII, residents of the area began to realize that pollution, logging, and the increasing population were negatively affecting the salmon runs. Conservation measures soon began, but the tribes wanted to maintain their fishing habits, which had not changed for generations. Sports and commercial fishermen thought the tribes should have to follow the same state laws and regulations as they did. The Washington State Sportsman's Council sided with the white fishers and supported the conservation effort. The first arrest occurred in 1954. Robert Satiacum was arrested for gillnetting without a license and out of season. The case continued up to Washington's Supreme Court. It was eventually dropped, but had a lasting effect. the decision by lower courts suggested that the State had the jurisdiction to regulate Indian fishing. The conflict continued for the next few years and began to gather more publicity in 1964. In February, tribal leaders met with members of the NCAI and the NIYC. They decided to take action to protect treaty rights. How to protest became a topic of contention, because many feared their cause would become linked with the American Indian civil rights movement, which was occurring at the same time. Mel Thom said, \\"[T]his is an Indian treaty, not a civil rights issue\\". The NIYC and others felt that if their issue were equated with racial issues it would affect the outcome. The American Indian problem was a century's old battle of tribes with power related to their relations with the federal government, and they wanted it to remain within those terms. Many of the tribes in Washington gave their support to the cause, as did some Seminole from Florida, Winnebago from Nebraska, Blackfoot from Montana, Shoshone from Wyoming, and Sioux (Lakota) from the Dakotas. Prominent American actor Marlon Brando joined the fish-in and was arrested on March 2, 1964, during a NIYC fish-in on the Puyallup River. Episcopal minister John Yaryan from San Francisco was also arrested. These demonstrations were called \\"fish- ins\\" for publicity purposes; the activists believed that the world would better understand the protests after seeing the connection to the sit-ins carried out by young blacks in the South in order to get service at lunch counters. On March 3, 1964, a NIYC-planned protest occurred in Olympia, Washington. Somewhere between 1,500 and 5,000 people attended, making it the largest intertribal protest to date. Traditional dances were performed on the steps of the state capitol, organizers gave speeches, and in front of the governor's mansion, one group held a war dance. Clyde Warrior declared that the fish-in protesting was establishing \\"the beginning of a new era in the history of American Indians\\". In the end, the fish-ins of March 1964 did not bring about immediate change, but they attracted members of more than 45 tribes, helping build a pan-Native American movement. Many of NIYC's members called them the \\"greatest Indian victory of modern day\\". The fish-ins continued well into the late 1960s. Finally, in 1974, the United States Supreme Court closed United States v. Washington to further review. The decision mandated that the treaty Indians had the right to catch 50% of Washington's harvestable fish. Poor People's Campaign The NIYC was involved with African-American civil rights organizations in the Poor People's Campaign during the late 1960s in Washington, D.C. In 1967,Martin Luther King, Jr. and leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) began to plan a mass demonstration of poor people to converge on the nation's capital to raise awareness of the need for jobs, housing, and medical care.Cobb, Daniel M.(2008). Native Activism In Cold War America: The Struggle for Sovereignty, University Press of Kansas, Kansas. . Members from the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the NIYC, and other Native organizations met with King in March 1968. The NCAI and NIYC disagreed on how to approach the anti-poverty campaign; the NCAI decided against participating in the march. The NCAI wished to pursue their battles in the courts and with Congress, unlike the NIYC, which was ready to demonstrate. The poor from all over the United States descended on Washington, D.C., in early May. More than 2,000 demonstrators were transported by car, bus, and train to Resurrection City, a shantytown in West Potomac Park. Over 200 Native people were involved. The following is an excerpt from a statement made by Mel Thom on May 1, 1968, during a meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk: (It was written by members of the Workshop on American Indian Affairs and the NIYC) = Trail of Broken Treaties = NIYC was one of several organizations that participated in the cross-country Trail of Broken Treaties Caravan, which was organized by the American Indian Movement (AIM). The Trail of Broken Treaties occurred from November 3 until November 9, 1972. It started as a caravan of cars from various reservations in the United States intending to reach Washington, D.C. It ended with a week-long occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs section of the Department of Interior headquarters. The goal of the Trail of Broken Treaties was to gain positive media attention to build support for tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It was one of the first times that American Indians united together.

The party was founded by Teja Singh Swatantar and Fazal Elahi Qurban. The party had a provisional politburo consisting of Swatantar, Qurban and Dutt. On one hand, the PCP split represented dissatisfaction with the shift of the party line on the national question. In 1942 CPI had, in response to the demand for Pakistan, formulated a position which supported the notion of self- determination of nationalities. By 1947 this line had been reverted and the Muslim demand for Pakistan was now branded as a reactionary movement by CPI. Swatantar and Qurban argued towards the CPI leadership to retain support for self-determination of nationalities. The PCP was built on this position. The founders of PCP were also opposed to the new CPI line on Kashmir. On the other hand, the launch of PCP was not only about disagreements on the issue of Pakistan and Muslim national self-determination. It also represented a revolt of the old Kirti-Ghadar revolutionaries against the CPI party hierarchy. On 22 June two central CPI leaders (Ajoy Ghosh and B.T. Ranadive) had arrived in Punjab, supposedly to depose Swatantar as Provincial Party Secretary. A few weeks later, on 16 July 1947 the foundation of PCP was declared in a letter sent out to 40 communist parties around the world. The PCP split severely affected the CPI in Punjab at the time. The CPI leadership reacted strongly to the formation of PCP. On 18 July 1947 a letter was sent to all Party District Committees in Punjab, instructing them to denounce the PCP. Ghosh himself visited the western parts of Punjab, trying to dissuade local party branches from siding with PCP. Nevertheless, it was understood that more than half of the 2,293 CPI members in Punjab were supportive of the PCP. The PCP was mainly based in western Punjab. PCP appealed to CPI branches in the North-West Frontier Province, Sindh and Baluchistan to join the new party. In Sindh the group around Qadir Baksh Nizamani supported the PCP. Nevertheless, by the time PCP was formed Punjab was engulfed by communal violence in the days before the Partition of India. As riots raged, most Sikh and Hindu communist cadres in the western districts of Punjab left for India. This exodus left the communist movement on the verge of extinction in the lands that would soon form West Pakistan. PCP, whose leadership was predominately Sikh, quickly became defunct.

Ho Chi Minh (19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969)  Hồ Chí Minh whose birth name was Nguyễn Sinh Cung and also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành and Nguyễn Ái Quốc was a Vietnamese communist revolutionary who sought both the independence of Vietnam as well as reformation of society along Marxist-Leninist lines. He left his country on a French steamer in 1911 and traveled extensively around the world participating actively in Communist International before returning to Vietnam in 1941. He then organized and led the Việt Minh to fight for Vietnamese Independence. He became more popular for his declaration of Vietnam independence from France, which paraphrased a part of the U.S declaration of independence that says \\"All men are created equal…\\" Since 1945, he became a prime minister and president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). In the late 1950s, Ho Chi Minh organized another communist guerrilla movement widely known as Việt Cộng in South Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh was the key figure and held the main leadership of North Vietnam during both wars in the country. He remained a great source of inspiration for the Vietnamese who were fighting for a united Vietnam as in his wish after he officially stepped aside in 1965 and even after his death in 1969. The final offensive against Saigon – the capital of South Vietnam in 1975 was named after him (the Ho Chi Minh Campaign). Vietnam was reunified under the North Vietnamese after the fall of Saigon in April 1975, nearly 30 years after Ho's declaration of independence and 6 years after his death. Soon after that, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of his vast contributions to Vietnam.  Võ Nguyên Giáp (August 25, 1911 – October 4, 2013)  Võ Nguyên Giáp was a General, Commander in Chief of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) and Vietnamese politician. He played a major role as a commander in the First Indochina War (1946–1954) and the Vietnam War (1960–1975) in which he was involved directly in many important campaigns such as the Border Campaign in Fall–Winter (1950), the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ (1954), the Tết Offensive (1968), the Easter Offensive (1972), the final Ho Chi Minh Campaign (1975) which led to the fall of Saigon and South Vietnam. Giáp, together with Hồ Chí Minh, was the most prominent figure of North Vietnam during the wars in the country. After the war, he was still the Minister of Defence until 1980 and served as a member of Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam until his retirement in 1991. Giáp celebrated his 100th birthday in 2011 and becomes the oldest Vietnam political and military figure that have ever lived. He is also considered by both his partisans and opponents as one of the greatest military commanders in history.  Ngô Đình Diệm (3 January 1901 – 2 November 1963)  Diệm was a Vietnamese politician served as an officer in the Nguyễn dynasty. Because of his drastic ideological of anti-communism, Diệm received support from the United States and became the first President of the Republic of Vietnam in 1955. However, as a Catholic, Diệm pursued the persecution of Buddhists which led to many religious protests notably the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. As a result, Diem gradually lost U.S support and was assassinated, together with his brother Nhu, in a coup in 1963. The Vietnam war raged on. thumb  Nguyễn Cao Kỳ (8 September 1930 – 23 July 2011)  Nguyễn Cao Kỳ was a senior army officer and a former politician of Republic of Vietnam. He served as a prime minister (1965–1967) and Vice President (1967–1971) of the Republic of Vietnam. From an ally, he then became the opponent of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and was mostly sidelined during Thiệu's presidency. Ky had been seen as an aggressive anti-Communist person in the period before 1975 and but then was regarded as a symbol of national reconciliation by the Vietnamese Communist Party since 2004 when he became the first South Vietnamese leader returning to the country.  Nguyễn Văn Thiệu (5 April 1923 – 29 September 2001)  Thiệu was the Leadership Committee Chairman (1965–1967) and President of the Republic of Vietnam (1967–1975). In 1963, Thiệu joined a military coup to overthrow Diem. During his years as president, Thiệu was accused of indulging in corruption. His struggle for power with Ky led to the decisions of side- lining Ky's supporters and choosing loyalists instead of decent commanders to lead the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces. He strongly opposed the Paris Peace Accords (1973) and publicly blamed the U.S not keeping its promise for fall of Saigon and South Vietnam in 1975.

Origins Maelan appears to be one of the earliest recorded kings of the territory of Maigh Seola, later known as Uí Briúin Seóla. He is not recorded in the genealogies, of which Francis John Byrne has this to say: > The Uí Briúin pedigrees show every sign of falsification ... Uí Briúin Seóla > of the Tuam area in County Galway ... trace their separate descent though > lines of unrecorded or dubious ancestors to Brión or his suppositious son > Dauí (Dauí Tenga Uma) in the 5th century; ... such an adoption guaranteed > them the tribute-free status of sáer-thuatha and ensured that Uí Briúin > power should stretch from the Shannon to Clew Bay. Thus it would appear that Maelan, and by implication his possible descendants, the Muintir Murchada, were political allies and not blood-relatives of the Uí Briúin. Magh Seola was surrounded to the east by the Soghain and the Uí Maine; to the south Conmaicne Máenmaige and the Uí Fiachrach Aidhne; to the west by the Delbhna Tir Dha Locha; to the north and far north-west, the Conmhaícne. The Viking Wars In the first half of the 9th century, Ireland experienced raids by Vikings. Some occurred in Connacht: * 812 - A slaughter of the heathens by the men of Umall (Clew Bay). A slaughter of the Conmhaícne by the heathens. * 813 - The slaughter at Umall by the heathens in which fell Coscrach son of Flannabra and Dúnadach, king of Umall. * 835 -All the country of Connaught was likewise desolated by them. * 837 - A battle was gained by the Gentiles over the Connaughtmen, wherein was slain Maelduin, son of Muirgius mac Tommaltaig, with numbers of others along with him. * 843 - An expedition by Turgesius, lord of the foreigners, upon Loch Ribh (Lough Ree, so that they plundered Connaught and Meath, and burned Cluain Mic Nois (Clonmacnoise, with its oratories, Cluain Fearta Brenainn, (Clonfert), Tir Da Ghlas (Terryglass), Lothra (Lorrha), and many others in like manner. * 844 - A battle was gained over the Connaughtmen by the foreigners, in which Riagan, son of Fearghus; Mughron, son of Diarmaid; and Aedh, son of Catharnach, with many others, were slain. * 847 - A fleet of seven score ships of the people of the king of the foreigners came to contend with the foreigners that were in Ireland before them, so that they disturbed Ireland between them. During one such episode in 848, Maelan was slain by the foreigners. He is anachronistically referred to as lord of Ui Briuin of South Connaught.

Widforss is most frequently associated with landscapes from American National Parks.Gunnar Mauritz Widforss (The Gunnar Widforss Catalogue Raisonné Project) Early life Gunnar Widforss was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Mauritz Widforss and Blenda Carolina Weydenhayn, who were the parents of thirteen children. Mauritz Widforss (1836-1905) owned a hunting apparel retailer bearing his name, which in 1968 was acquired by Erling Persson to form Hennes & Mauritz (H&M;). Widforss' mother was an amateur artist who had studied at the Technical Institute, now Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design. At the age of sixteen Widforss began his studies of painting at the same school. Following the completion of his studies at the Technical Institute in 1900, Widforss traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia to work as an apprentice decorative painter. He returned home a year-and-a-half later and then embarked on an extended period of travel around Europe and America.Bill Belknap and Frances Spencer Belknap. Notes of interviews with Gunnar Widforss' friends. Museum of Northern Arizona Library. Widforss worked primarily in watercolor and he led a bohemian lifestyle traveling in search of great landscapes to paint. Between 1904 and 1909 he ventured to Austria, Switzerland, the Mediterranean region and North Africa. From 1906 to 1907 he visited the United States where he resided in Jacksonville, Florida and later Brooklyn, New York doing odd jobs and paintings on commission. Career Half Dome rising above Yosemite Valley (1922) Soon after arriving in California in early 1921, Widforss made his way to Yosemite Valley. He made it his semi-regular home from 1926-1929. It was in Yosemite that he met National Park Service director Stephen T. Mather in 1922. Mather became a friend and patron and suggested that Widforss focus his talents on America's National Parks.Bill Belknap and Frances Spencer Belknap (1969) Gunnar Widforss: Painter of the Grand Canyon (Flagstaff, AZ: Northland Press for the Museum of Northern Arizona) In 1923 Widforss illustrated Harold Symmes book \\"Songs of Yosemite.\\" By the late summer of 1921 he had consigned his watercolors to San Francisco's Gump Gallery and was painting and exhibiting in Carmel. Thereafter he had successful exhibitions in: Los Angeles at the Stendahl Galleries and the California Water Color Society; the East Bay at the Oakland Art Gallery and Hotel Oakland; and San Francisco at the Rabjohn & Morcom Gallery and habitually at Gump's. According to the U.S. Census in April 1930, he resided as a lodger in the San Francisco home of Théophile Fritzen and was an unmarried landscape artist who officially became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1929. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). Widforss made his first trip to the Southwest in 1923, visiting Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks. The following year the artist made his only trip to Yellowstone National Park where he made numerous paintings of the spectacular canyon and falls of the Yellowstone River.Bill Belknap and Frances Spencer Belknap. Notes of interviews with friends of Gunnar Widforss. Museum of Northern Arizona Library. In the 1930s, he was an artist for the Works Progress Administration. He worked in Arizona, creating large watercolors of the Salt River Valley and Grand Canyon. Widforss lived briefly at the home of Emery and Ellsworth Kolb, operators of the Kolb Studio on the rim and later resided in a Fred Harvey Company dormitory. His paintings were sold in the art gallery in the lobby of the El Tovar Hotel.Gunnar Widforss Biography (Californiawatercolor.com) Major museum exhibitions of Widforss' work have been rare. The first was presented in December 1924 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The exhibit included 72 watercolors that primarily included scenes of western National parks. William Henry Holmes, the first Director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. D. C., and an artist also known for his extraordinarily accurate drawings and watercolors, commented on Widforss' Grand Canyon paintings in the exhibit. \\"They are remarkable as to geological construction and color. They give a more satisfactory understanding of the Grand Canyon than any that have hitherto been attempted. It is well nigh impossible to convey the immensity and grandeur of these marvels of nature but Widforss has accomplished it.\\" Holmes went on to say that \\"These are some of the finest things of their kind that have come out of the West.\\" In 1926 and 1928 Widforss participated in two exhibits at the Brooklyn Museum of art sponsored by the Society of Scandinavian American Artists. In 1934, he was diagnosed with an illness and told to avoid the high altitude of Grand Canyon Village. Widforss died later that year at the South Rim of a heart attack at the age of fifty-five. He was buried by his friends in the Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery on the South Rim. His estate contained over 150 finished and unfinished paintings. Gunnar Mauritz Widforss (1879-1934) (Museum Collections Featuring Works by Gunnar Widforss)  Legacy  Gunnar Widforss left a great legacy and inspiration for the realistic painters of western landscapes that followed his path. The accuracy of his drawing and use of color and his ability to express deep space and atmospheric effects are unrivaled. In his commitment to the truth and beauty of his subject, Widforss never resorted to sentimental or romanticized depictions, so prevalent in depictions of the West. The Widforss Trail on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon was named for Gunnar Widforss. The trailhead is approximately 3 miles north of the North Rim Lodge. The trail follows the canyon rim and meanders through the forest to emerge at Widforss Point. Widforss Point is a narrow, wooded promontory half a mile southeast of the end of the Widforss trail.Widforss Trail (North Rim of the Grand Canyon)Widforss Point (Grand Canyon National Park)Widforss Trail (Plan your Grand Canyon visit) Gallery Gunnar Widforss - Vy mot riksdagshuset, Stockholm.jpgView towards the Parliament House (1914) Gunnar Widforss - Näckrosdamm.jpgWater-Lily Pond (1915) Selected works * Harold Symmes (1923) Songs of Yosemite (Yosemite, CA: Ansel Hall) Poetry by Harold Symmes, watercolor illustrations by Gunnar Widforss.

Nirvana II was built as a civilian motorboat of the same name in 1916 by Brett Brothers at West Lynn, Massachusetts. The U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, J. Hartley Merrick of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 18 May 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel. She was commissioned as USS Nirvana II (SP-204) the same day with Lieutenant, junior grade, Frederic M. Gardner in command. Nirvana II was assigned to the 4th Naval District, headquartered at Philadelphia, during the war, alternating between the Northern Patrol Area and the Southern Patrol Area along the United States East Coast. The routine was interrupted in June 1917 when she took to high seas patrol from 9 to 12 June and dispatch boat duty from 13 to 16 June. In September 1917, she joined the Special Cruising Squadron, adding status to her patrol duties. After a respite at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on League Island in Philadelphia in February 1918, Nirvana II was based at Reedy Island in the Delaware River and shuttled from one island to another around Philadelphia. She remained at this work until dispatch duty to New Castle, Delaware, in August 1918. Thereafter she moved up to Essington, Pennsylvania, for boarding duty in September 1918.

Hawkins (October 25, 1916, Roxton, Texas – May 17, 2013 in Fredericksburg, Virginia) was a United States Marines Corps colonel employed by the CIA for the military planning, training of Cuban exiles, and the effective military command of forces in the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. Hawkins was known by the alias John Haskins. Biography Jack Hawkins graduated as a second lieutenant from the United States Naval Academy. In 1939, he attended the Marine Corps Basic School for officers, and then served with the Fourth Marines in Shanghai and in the Philippines when the regiment was transferred there in late 1941.Hawkins. 1961. Never Say Die. World War II During World War II, he saw service in the Philippines at the Battle of Bataan and was taken prisoner by Japanese armed forces after the Battle of Corregidor. Initially sent to a prison camp on Luzon, he was later transferred to another prison camp on Mindanao where conditions were somewhat better. The new prison camp was actually a pre-war convict facility on a plantation. Eventually, he and two other POWs, one of whom was William Dyess, planned an escape.Dyess, W.E., 1944, The Dyess Story, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons However, the need for additional expertise in their post-escape plans brought the total number of Americans in the group to ten, including Samuel Grashio and Austin Shofner. Then they enlisted the help of two Filipinos who had been imprisoned before the war as convicts to serve as guides. The escape was successful and the two Filipinos eventually received pardons for their assistance. The group moved through dangerous swamps for several days and eventually stumbled upon a guerrilla unit. This unit passed the Americans on to other bands until the escapees eventually were led to Colonel Wendell Fertig, who commanded the American-Filipino guerrillas on Mindanao. Hawkins served with the guerrillas for seven months. He led raiding parties in attacks against Japanese forces, before traveling to Australia via submarine in November 1943. Hawkins received the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in the Philippines during the period 4 April - 15 November 1943. In 1961, Hawkins authored a book, Never Say Die, on his POW and guerrilla experiences. In 1945, Hawkins was involved in the planning of the U.S. invasion of Japanese-held territory in the Battle of Okinawa. Author Don Bohning states that Hawkins was not involved in planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima.Bohning (2005), pp. 14-18 Post war Following World War II, he served as a member of the Naval Mission to Venezuela for three years as adviser to the Venezuelan Marine Corps, before returning to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In September 1950, as Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, he led his battalion ashore at the Battle of Inchon, Korea, and later participated in the Chosin Reservoir campaign. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions there. In 1955 he was promoted to full colonel, becoming commander of the Amphibious Forces at Little Creek, Virginia. He served for three years as an instructor on amphibious landings in Marine Corps schools at Quantico. Bay of Pigs Invasion On the recommendation of Marine Corps Commandant General David M. Shoup, Colonel Hawkins was recruited by the CIA which wanted a Marine officer with background in amphibious warfare to help with a project to land some exile troops in Cuba. He was assigned to the Cuba task force on Sept 1, 1960, when CIA Deputy Director of Plans Richard M. Bissell Jr. began to expand the planned operation from a guerrilla infiltration to an amphibious assault. At the CIA, Hawkins was appointed Chief of Paramilitary Operations Western Hemisphere Division Branch 4 (WH/4/PM), reporting to Jacob Esterline, Chief of Western Hemisphere Branch 4 (WH/4). He was already fluent in Spanish, and under his command were Grayston Lynch and William \\"Rip\\" Robertson as the CIA representatives in the amphibious landings. ( Col. Stanley W. Beerli, the chief of air operations, reported to Richard Bissell ). From his base in Miami, he instructed the combatants via radio links relayed via US Navy ships, aiming to defeat Cuban government forces in the conflict.

It holds a capacity of 1,000 spectators and includes dugouts, batting cages, and a modern scoreboard over the left field fence. History Prior to the field's construction, Hartford's baseball program played at several venues in central Connecticut following its move off campus in the mid 1980s. These venues included New Britain's Beehive Field, Bristol's Muzzy Field, East Hartford's Ray McKenna Field, and Simsbury's Memorial Field. Ground was broken on the venue in April 2005. The venue opened on March 29, 2006, and Hartford's first game there was against Massachusetts. Hartford won the game, 6–2. Renaming Through the 2009 season, the field was known as the Hartford Baseball Field. In a ceremony on October 4, 2009, the venue was renamed Fiondella Field, in honor of the Fiondella family, primarily businessman Robert Fiondella, because of his involvement in the Hartford community.Hartford Baseball Field Dedicated Fiondella Field on Sunday at hartfordhawks.com, URL accessed October 18, 2009.

It aired on October 19, 2009. Plot A police officer, Donny Compson, and his partner are chasing a man who continuously evades them using parkour techniques, eventually leading the chase to a rooftop. Donny attempts to leap from building to building in pursuit, but falls short and plummets to the ground. In the hospital, Donny reveals that his great-grandfather, his grandfather, and his father have all died of a mysterious heart disease shortly after reaching the age of 40. This leads the team to investigate, despite House's insistence that it's merely a coincidence. Chase and Foreman begin performing a battery of tests to look for genetic diseases and examine his ancestors' remains, but find nothing. House eventually fools the patient into believing he has an imaginary disease (Ortolli syndrome) and discharges him after giving him mints as a \\"treatment\\" for his illness. However, a few hours later Foreman tells House that Donny had suddenly died while doing his laundry. During the patient's autopsy he bleeds and suddenly awakens, obviously alive, which leads the team to readmit him and to try to find the reason for his illness and \\"miraculous\\" resurrection. House eventually solves the case, with the solution being that the patient had an intracranial berry aneurysm in the brain stem which applied pressure on various nerves, leading to the patient's symptoms, including the \\"stopping\\" of his heart. Side stories include House hearing whispering in odd places, which turn out to be Wilson whispering to Amber at night. Chase, who cannot get over Dibala's death, is unable to enter the ICU. At House's behest, Chase finally seeks a priest for help who tells him that the right thing to do would be to turn himself in. Ignoring the priest's advice, Chase tries to drink his troubles away. Cameron is seen phoning the police as Chase walks in late, and goes away on her own when Chase still will not tell her the reason for his odd behavior. At the very end, House speaks to his father about focusing on the wrong thing and then yells to Wilson, whom he knows will be listening on the other side of the wall.

The \\"afterlife of slavery\\" can be characterized by the enduring presence of slavery's racialized violence still present in contemporary society. Hartman outlines slavery's imprint on all sectors of society as evidenced in historical archives that may or may not exist. Hence, the archive lives on through the social structure of the society and its citizens. Hartman describes this process in detail in Lose Your Mother: \\"I wanted to engage the past, knowing that its perils and dangers still threatened and that even now lives hung in the balance. Slavery had established a measure of man and a ranking of life and worth that has yet to be undone. If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America, it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the burden of a too-long memory, but because black lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago. This is the afterlife of slavery—skewed life chances, limited access to health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment. I, too, am the afterlife of slavery.\\" Hartman went back to Africa to learn more about slavery and came back having learned more about herself. Hartman further fleshes out the afterlives of slavery through the ways in which photographic capture and enclosure spills into domestic spaces. Hartman exposes the limits of such capture as she describes the hallway as a regulative, yet intimate space. She writes, “It is inside but public…The hallway is a space uneasy with expectation and tense with force of unmet desire. It is the liminal zone between the inside and outside for the one who stays in the ghetto; the reformer documenting the habitat of the poor passes through without noticing it, failing to see what can be created in cramped space, if not an overture, a desecration, or to regard our beautiful flaws and terrible ornaments.\\" Contributions to the understanding of slavery Hartman has made literary and theoretical contributions to the understanding of slavery. Her first book, Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self- Making in Nineteenth-Century America, is an examination of, among other topics, the intersection of slavery, gender, and the development of progressivism in the United States through the exploration of blank genealogies, memory, and the lingering effects of racism. Working through a variety of cultural materials –- diaries, journals, legal texts, slave and other narratives, and historical song and dance—Hartman explores the precarious institution of slave power. Her second book, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (2007), confronts the troubled relationships among memory, narratives, and representation. She concentrates on the \\"non-history\\" of the slave, the manner in which slavery \\"erased any conventional modality for writing an intelligible past\\". By weaving her own biography into a historical construction, \\"she [also] explores and evokes the non-spaces of black experience—the experience through which the African captive became a slave, became a non-person, became alienated from personhood. Through these experiences, came the title: \\"Because of the slave trade you lose your mother, if you know your history, you know where you come from. To lose your mother was to be denied your kin, country and identity. To lose your mother was to forget your past\\" (85).Hartman, Lose Your Mother (2007), p. 85. Hartman's contributions to understanding slavery caught the attention of UC Irvine's Frank B. Wilderson III, well known for setting groundwork and coining the phrase \\"Afro-pessimism\\". This criticism examines unflinching paradigmatic analysis on the structures of modernity produced by slavery and genocide. While he considers her Scenes of Subjection as Afro-pessimist scholarship, Hartman herself has not called it so. Contributions to historical archiving Hartman has contributed insight into the forms and functions of the historical archive, providing both pointed critiques of and methodological guides to approaching the archive in scholarly work. In both Scenes of Subjection and Lose Your Mother, Hartman accesses and critically interrogates the historical archive. In the case of the latter, much of this is done through the combined re-reading of historical narratives of slavery and through the connection of these narratives to the physical location of Ghana. Hartman, who centers much of her interrogation of slavery's archive on Elmina Castle, inserts her own voice as one way to counter the silences surrounding forgotten slaves.Hartman, Saidiya. Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 116. The difficulty of this excavation process is revealed partly in the continued tension between Hartman's interest in slavery and the rejection of this interest on the part of Ghanaians, who are depicted as ostracizing Hartman in a number of instances in the text.Hartman, Saidiya. Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Trade Route Terror. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007, p. 6. In addition, and though she draws from \\"plantation journals and documents, newspaper accounts, missionary tracts, travel writing ... government reports, et cetera,\\" Hartman recognizes that \\"these documents are 'not free from barbarism.'\\"Hartman, Scenes of Subjection (1997), p. 10. Arguably all of Hartman's work is guided by \\"the impossibility of fully recovering the experience of the enslaved and the emancipated\\" from these written accounts, and she reads them \\"against the grain\\", knowing that in her use of these \\"official\\" records, she runs \\"the risk of reinforcing the authority of these documents even as I try to use them for contrary purposes\\". Hartman introduces the concept of narrative restraint in her article \\"Venus in Two Acts\\" to delay an archival impulse to continually register as \\"a death sentence, a tomb, a display of the violated body\\". In this article, she returns to the slaver Recovery for an exploration that began in Lose Your Mother. Unable to write about the girl named Venus owing to her brief appearance in the archive, Hartman's attempts to resuscitate possible narratives for her ultimately lead to failure. She explains, \\"But in the end I was forced to admit that I wanted to console myself and to escape the slave hold with a vision of something other than the bodies of two girls settling on the floor of the Atlantic.\\" Hartman ultimately restrains her desire to imaginatively recreate Venus's final days, her passages in Lose Your Mother only briefly mentioning Venus's fate. Her inclusion in \\"Venus\\" of the narratives omitted in Lose Your Mother, with the caveat that such narratives push beyond the boundaries of the archive, leads to the concept of narrative restraint, \\"the refusal to fill in the gaps and provide closure.\\" While she excavates the historical archive in her attempt to understand the possibilities for subjectivity for the black slave (in Scenes of Subjection), the possibilities for African Diasporic community (in Lose Your Mother), a question she in her article \\"Venus in Two Acts\\" serves as a guiding principle and a lesson on archival method: \\"If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how might it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from this archive?\\"\\"Venus in Two Acts,\\" Small Axe 26 (June 2008): 1–14, p. 7. The Promised Lands Black people in the Diaspora, with no knowledge of a past, try to imagine a past that is nothing like the harsh present entangled with murder, humiliation, and incarceration. Such imaginations include the pre-colonial era of Kings and Queens. Rastafarians envision a sort of replica of such a past into the future with calls of the downfall of Babylon and a return to the Promised Land. Hartman explains: \\"The heirs of slaves wanted a past of which they could be proud, so they conveniently forgot the distinctions between the rulers and the ruled and closed eyes to slavery in Africa. They pretended that their ancestors had once worn the king’s vestments and assumed grand civilization of Asante as their own.\\"Hartman, Lose Your Mother (2007), p. 164. This, coupled with a longing for belonging only achievable by escaping the brutality of the West's racism and returning to Africa the homeland, led to disbelief and shock when encountering Ghanaians who favored migrating to the U.S. to escape the impoverishment of the present. Hartman notes: \\"African Americans entertained fantasies of return and Ghanaians of departure. From where we each were standing, we did not see the same past, nor did we share a common vision of the Promised Land.\\"Hartman, Lose Your Mother (2007), p. 165. To the Ghanaians, the Promised Land is America, the images heavily circulated in movies, music videos, and more, that tell one story of wealth and prosperity even for Black Americans.

Hartman describes the boundaries of Black life and womanhood through both interracial and intra-racial relationships and examines how Black women's sexuality was policed and constructed within an ideology of criminality at the turn of the twentieth century. These \\"deviant\\" behaviors are referred to as \\"wayward\\" and illustrate how Black women navigate society under surveillance, violence, and partial or conditional citizenship. The social life of Black women under surveillance results in these wayward movements being characterized as \\"illegal\\". These movements serve as an act of resistance against not only the state, but the examination of Black life under the guise of policy researchers, sociologists, and reformers aiming to improve Black women in New York and Philadelphia. Hartman asks how to imagine Black womanhood outside of the archive and \\"the sociological imagination that could only ever recognize her as a problem,\\" invoking DuBois' famed question in The Souls of Black Folk: \\"How does it feel to be a problem?\\" Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval critiques the pathologization of Black women's lives by constructing a social space of freedom and \\"waywardness\\" as acts of world- making and possibility. It won the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award (Criticism).  Statements  \\"I think of my work as bridging theory and narrative. I am very committed to a storied articulation of ideas, but working with concepts as building blocks enables me to think about situation and character as well as my own key terms.\\" Prizes Hartman has been a Fulbright, Rockefeller, Whitney Oates, and University of California President's Fellow and was awarded the 2007 Narrative Prize from Narrative Magazine and the Gustav Myers Award for Human Rights.

Butcher, former lead singer of Orlando's The Heathens, recorded his first solo album during the summer of 2008. Entitled Me and My Friends, the album was released independently in the fall of 2008 and was voted one of the ten best of that year in the Orlando Sentinel.  History  Born in England in 1983, Butcher spent his youth moving with his family; first to London, then to Amsterdam then to Colorado Springs before finally settling in Orlando in 1999. Learning to play the guitar at an early age, Butcher soon joined a series of local bands in Orlando, culminating with a position as lead singer and songwriter for The Heathens. The band enjoyed moderate success, releasing one album, \\"Big White House\\", and touring the East Coast of the United States. After leaving The Heathens in August 2006 to pursue his own songwriting, Matt Butcher began playing with a series of different musicians to find a sound quality that would suit his distinctive style. Having opened as a solo artist for The Avett Brothers, Conor Oberst, and The Felice Brothers Butcher was ready to add additional instruments to fully accompany his songs.  The Revolvers  Starting first with Pedal Steel player Tom Cooper, Butcher soon added Daniel Berry on drums, Matthew Mendel on keyboard and vocals, Dave Chmil on guitar and vocals and Gus Ramage on bass. The newly named \\"Revolvers\\", both as an homage to the gunslinging South Butcher so often imbues and the multi- instrumentalist abilities of the players in the band, began almost immediately playing as Butcher's backing band at local Orlando venues, and soon built a loyal following; culminating in a sold out CD-release show for Me and My Friends. The album, produced by Justin Beckler and self-funded by Butcher, was given four and a half stars from five by Reax Music Magazine, saying, \\"Matt Butcher has carved out his own immediately recognizable niche, a dewey-praire [sic] mix of wistfulness and confession executed with a deceptively light touch that only barely suggests the material's substance... and it only gets better with repeated listens.\\" Present activities After the success of his debut album, Matt Butcher and his backing band the Revolvers opened for The Avett Brothers on their Florida tour dates. After the construction and debut of his personal website in September 2009, Butcher opted to emulate Radiohead and follow the \\"pay as you go\\" business model of In Rainbows. for the digital distribution of his music.

From 1980 to 1984, he led the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Securitate, the secret service of Communist Romania. He was described by the New York Times and Associated Press at the time of his death as \\"a die-hard Communist and ruthless chief of the Securitate secret police.\\" A participant in various actions taken against armed or peaceful anti-communist groups, Pleșiță began his career as a Romanian Communist Party cadre, and rose through the ranks of the Securitate while holding various political offices in the Interior Ministry. Personally involved in the brutal interrogation of dissidents such as Paul Goma, and allegedly the person masterminding several attacks on the Romanian diaspora, he is most remembered for his connections with the Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. He arranged for Carlos to be sheltered in Romania after the bombing of Radio Free Europe and was accused, but eventually found innocent in a Romanian court, of complicity in the bombing. After the successful 1989 Revolution, Pleșiță was also noted for openly admitting his various involvements in acts of violence, and for claiming that they were justified by circumstance. Biography=Early years and activities against the armed resistance Pleşiţă was born in Curtea de Argeș, a town in Argeș County, southern Romania. According to Gheorghe Florescu, a black marketer of coffee and memoirist who met Pleşiţă during communism, the future general had exceptionally lowly origins, being \\"the son of a farm hand with a two primary classes education and an illiterate peasant woman, who hailed from a family of outlaws in Târgoviște area.\\" A worker at the Moroieni Lumber Factory in his native city and head of the industry's trade union by the age of 18, he joined the Communist Party in 1947, the year when the communist regime was set up, and became active in party affairs. In 1948, Pleșiță was transferred to the Argeș County directorate of the Union of Communist Youth, and came to the attention of recruiters for the new Securitate secret police. He joined the organisation in 1948 and worked his way through the ranks during the 1950s: instantly promoted to the rank of Plutonier (Warrant Officer) active with the Securitate branch in Piteşti, he rose to high political office after 1951–1953, when he became Head of the Securitate Service in, successively, Regiunea Arad, Regiunea Vîlcea and Regiunea Argeș. He was afterward assigned to the national capital Bucharest, where he was himself a Securitate recruiter directly assigned to the Cadre Commission of the Interior Ministry, before returning to Piteşti in 1956 and taking over as temporary regional head of the Securitate. In 1958, Pleșiță earned communist distinction for his work in eradicating anti-communist resistance in the Carpathian regions of Transylvania. The honours he received included the Star of the People's Republic of Romania Order and the rank of Colonel. In parallel, having attended night school classes in Marxism-Leninism (which the regime had declared equivalent to university-level studies), he completed a one-year course in the Soviet Union. From 1961 to 1967, he was directly assigned to the Transylvanian city of Cluj, becoming head of the secret police apparatus in Regiunea Cluj. A deputy member of the regional Communist Party committee, he graduated from the History Department of the University of Cluj (Babeș-Bolyai) in 1968. Participation in repressions of the 1970s After the Cluj interval, he was again transferred to Bucharest as the head of the directorate of security guards at the Ministry of the Interior, where he was promoted to the rank of major general. In November 1972, Pleșiță was assigned to the homeland secret police department, as head of its 1st Directorate, also working as head of the Securitate Supply Office in Ilfov County (1972–1973). Having returned to as a deputy for the 1st Directorate, he held high office within the Interior Ministry: Secretary General (1973–1975) and First Deputy to Ministers Teodor Coman and George Homoștean (1975–1978). Nicolae Pleșiță was made lieutenant general by Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu in April 1977. According to Gheorghe Florescu's recollections, Pleșiță was also discreetly establishing himself as a presence on the criminal underground, by tolerating or endorsing illicit dealings in commodities. These activities, Florescu claimed, were shared among members of the communist elite, among them his fellow Securitate operative and future rival Ion Mihai Pacepa—while the latter secretly represented a pro-Western line within the intelligence and underworld environment, Pleșiță's dealings were reputedly directed toward Soviet and Middle Eastern connections. Also in 1977, Pleșiță was involved in the violent inquiry of writer Paul Goma, who had attempted to organize a local dissident movement and was eventually expelled from the country. A participant in the Goma movement, psychiatrist Ion Vianu (noted for exposing the use of involuntary commitment as a political weapon), recounted having met Pleșiță three times before being himself expelled to France: \\"The first time, upon the start of my dissidence, he shouted at me and looked on the verge of hitting me. The second time, several weeks later, he threatened me with prison telling me that he would lock me up with the 'loons' that they had committed into hospitals to ensure their protection and who, as detainees, would exert their revenge on me. Now, once the powers that be had decided to let me go, he was calm and only resorted to threatening me that, once abroad, I should not start talking, because the arm of the revolution was long and the wrath of the people would follow me.\\" Vianu also recalls having refused to make any such promise, but notes that the interest his case had already generated in France made \\"Pleșiță and his kind\\" fear taking more severe action against him.Matei Călinescu, Ion Vianu, Amintiri în dialog. Memorii, Polirom, Iaşi, 2005, p.420-421. In August of that year, he was credited with helping to stifle coal miners when unrest from the large-scale miners' strike in the Jiu Valley threatened the Ceauşescu regime's grip on society. The Securitate was accused of brutal repression and torture in its efforts to end the unrest. After Ceauşescu was widely booed and jeered during a five-hour speech to the miners, the Valley was declared a restricted area from August 4, 1977 until January 1, 1978. Large numbers of Securitate and military personnel were deployed to the area. Repression took various forms. Workers were interrogated at the Petroșani Securitate building, where some were beaten over the head and had their fingers bound to doors. At least 600 miners were interrogated; 150 penal dossiers were opened; 50 were forcefully hospitalised in psychiatric wards; 15 were sentenced to correctional labour and actually imprisoned, while a further 300 or more (who were considered dangerous) were internally deported. Almost 4,000 of the striking workers were sacked. Head of Foreign Intelligence and cooperation with Carlos After 1978, Pleșiță was commander of the Interior Ministry commissioned officers' school in Băneasa, while serving as member of the core Communist Party cell for its Ministry branch. From 1980 to 1984, after his predecessor Ion Mihai Pacepa had defected to the United States, Pleșiță was the head of the Securitate's Foreign Intelligence Service. In tandem, he served as First Deputy Interior Minister to Homoştean in several new Romanian cabinets, and rose to the position of substitute member of the Communist Party Central Committee. In 1981, the Securitate hired Carlos the Jackal to assassinate Romanian dissidents living in western Europe and to bomb the offices of Radio Free Europe (RFE), a Munich radio station that broadcast into Romania and other parts of the Eastern Bloc. Eight or nine persons were injured in the RFE bombing. Press reports indicated that Pleșiță brought Carlos to Romania to organize the RFE bombing and gave him plastic explosives, fake documents and videotapes, pictures and sketches of the RFE headquarters. Such accounts further reported that Pleșiță rewarded Carlos with $400,000 deposited in an account at the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade under the name of Carlos's lover and partner. Reportedly, Pleșiță ordered the RFE bombing and hired Carlos to murder Romanian dissidents in exile and also to assassinate his predecessor Pacepa. In November 1984, Pleșiță was deposed and appointed commander of the Grădiștea teacher training school for the Ministry of the Interior. Following the overthrow of Ceaușescu in the December 1989 Revolution, Pleșiță, who was passed into reserve with the rank of lieutenant general (1990), was indicted for complicity in the RFE bombing. German requests for extradition of Pleșiță were not granted, and he was tried instead by a Romanian military court. It also investigated the former Securitate general on charges of first-degree murder, assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping and several counts of perjury. During the procedures, Pleșiță testified that he had been assigned by Ceaușescu to contact and cooperate with Carlos. He went on record stating that he found Carlos a \\"sympathetic\\" figure and the charges \\"idiocies\\", while declining legal counsel. According to his own testimony: \\"This does not mean that, during the 42 years I've spent in the world of espionage, I was either a saint or a pillar of the church.\\" Pleșiță thus stated that he had personally masterminded the killing of dissidents: \\"I killed them, of course. That's what we did\\". In his account, the Securitate included an entire Lichidări (\\"Liquidations\\") service, which he had personally reorganised and assigned to Colonel Sergiu Nica. He also claimed: \\"the mission of those under [Nica's] orders was to liquidate those sentenced to death by final court decisions and who had fled the country. Only the soldiers who had files kept on them as traitors of the country were ever pursued and executed.\\" He also admitted that Ceaușescu had contemplated the use of Carlos's services against Pacepa, but concluded that the Venezuelan had ultimately been excluded from this scenario. In a 2008 documentary film produced by Alexandru Solomon, Carlos himself recalled having met and grown fond of Pleșiță, and indicated having received two Soviet-made rifles as presents from his Romanian connection. In later statements, Pleșiță came to allege that Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization and former collaborator of Carlos, was a homosexual, and physically attracted to (or even involved in a sexual relationship with) the Venezuelan terrorist. In 2000, the military court conducting the investigation of Pleșiță's role in the bombing stopped the investigation. In accordance with Romanian legal requirements, according to which civilians could only face civilian courts, the case was reassigned to regular prosecutors in 2004. In the spring of 2009, after 19 years of investigation, they decided to end the inquiry without a formal indictment, and the tribunal determined that Pleșiță was not guilty of complicity in the bombing. Prosecutor Dan Voinea, who had previously worked on the case, criticized the decision, noting that the evidence against Pleșiță was compelling, and that the decision to involve a civilian jurisdiction only became relevant after the dossier collaterally implicated former Securitate head Tudor Postelnicu, who held no military rank. In parallel, the CNSAS government agency (tasked with exposing secret Securitate files), officially attested that Pleșiță had been involved in political policing of the Romanian population, but its power to render such verdicts was being contested by other court decisions. In 2007, the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes presented a formal complaint against the general, accusing him of terrorism over the Munich bombing. Radio Free Europe's Șerban Orăscu, who joined the Institute in this gesture, suspected an attempt on the part of post-communist authorities to hide Pleșiță's involvement, arguing that several pages had been purposefully removed from his own Securitate file (which he had recovered from the CNSAS). Journalist Andreea Pora, who connects the procedural delays with the alleged unwillingness of Social Democratic politicians to investigate communist crimes, also notes that the decision not to indict Pleșiță closely followed a similar resolution in the case of Ion Iliescu, Social Democratic leader and first post-communist President, who was a subject of an inquiry about his participation in the Romanian Revolution. Pora also alleged that the civilian prosecutors were more likely to answer political commands than their military predecessors. Later claims and final years After the Revolution, Pleșiță continued to receive one of the largest pensions of any former government official in Romania and lived in a villa that was a gift from Ceaușescu. Press reports noted that he was receiving some 6,000 lei (around 2,000 Euros) or over per month. He withdrew to the outskirts of Curtea de Argeș, where he lived in the same house as his son, and was said to have been frequently visited by another suspected Securitate torturer, Gheorghe Enoiu. In his later years, Pleșiță was often interviewed in the Romanian press and expressed no remorse for his role in crushing anti- communist dissent. This attitude was itself the subject of controversy. Evenimentul Zilei journalist Vlad Stoicescu referred to Pleșiță as \\"one of the most visible and vocal communist torturers in Romania\\". Similarly, România Liberă daily referred to Pleșiță as \\"the perfect example of a Securitate boss, who openly assumed his actions of political policing, and even murders committed by the communists, but who lived a carefree existence in post-1989 Romania.\\" Andreea Pora viewed his stance as clashing with the official condemnation of communism by President Traian Băsescu and the Tismăneanu Commission, noting: \\"At a time when Traian Băsescu was condemning communism in Parliament [...], Nicolae Pleșiță was laughing on live television broadcasts carried by various stations, casually admitting his crimes, telling us that they were 'mere trifles'.\\" According to Associated Press, this was partly made possible by the political climate of post-1989 Romania, where \\"many former high-ranking Securitate officers still have key positions in politics and business.\\" At times, his statements defined the Securitate as a body working \\"for the country's progress\\", and he personally urged former subordinates to assassinate \\"traitors who defected to the enemy.\\" He openly told interviewers that he had beaten dissident writer Paul Goma, and recounted that he had been dragging his prisoner around his Securitate cell by his beard. Using agent Matei Pavel Haiducu, the Securitate had later attempted, unsuccessfully, to assassinate Goma while he was in self-exile in France. Suspicion of Pleșiță's personal participation in this move made him the target of a separate investigation opened by Romanian prosecutors in 2007. Pleșiță's various accounts implicated many other figures in Romania and abroad. Referring to his early activities in Cluj, he claimed first-hand information that poet and communist journalist Anatol E. Baconsky, later known for his dissenting opinions, was an informer of the Securitate (according to literary critic Paul Cernat, the version of events told by \\"a butcher\\" matched that of the Securitate's victims within the Sibiu Literary Circle). In the 1990s, former Securitate agents stated that the Soviet KGB had charged the Securitate with \\"infiltrating France.\\" In his autobiography Red Horizons, Pleșiță's predecessor at the Foreign Intelligence Service, Pacepa, wrote that \\"Moscow attributed France as a field of action to the Romanian services.\\" In a television interview in 1999, Pleșiță said that Ceauşescu and French Socialist Party leader François Mitterrand had had a \\"special relationship.\\" Pleșiță also said Ceaușescu had directed at least 250,000 British pounds or $400,000 to Mitterrand's 1981 electoral campaign—which led to the first election of a Socialist President of France. In his retirement, Pleșiță stated that, during his time as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Romanian government had assisted North Korean leader Kim Il-sung to hide a secret transfer of nuclear technology and equipment, to be used in the Asian country's non- civilian nuclear programme. Pleșiță said the transfer took place during a 1984 visit to Bucharest by Kim Il-sung. According to Pleșiță, \\"When leaving, the presidential train also had aboard the elements necessary for producing the nuclear bomb, which Ceaușescu had sold to his North Korean friend.\\" Pleșiță died in September 2009 at age 80, after spending three months in a Bucharest sanatorium allegedly run by the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). He had suffered from several illnesses, including diabetes, but the cause of death was given as complications from a concussion. During his funeral service, held at the Capu Dealu Romanian Orthodox church in Curtea de Argeș, the SRI, obeying the family's wish, is said to have prevented reporters from witnessing the event. Intelligence Service spokespersons denied that the institution had overseen either Pleșiță's hospitalisation or his funeral.

A matter- wave beam stopped by an absorbing shutter exhibits an oscillatory density profile during its propagation after removal of the shutter. Whenever this propagation is accurately described by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the transient wave functions resemble the solutions that appear for the intensity of light subject to Fresnel diffraction by a straight edge. For this reason, the transient phenomenon was dubbed diffraction in time and has since then been recognised as ubiquitous in quantum dynamics .

Today, the cuisine of Dorset reflects the wider shift towards organic and local produce. These principles are upheld by farmers' markets, farm shops and fairs held across Dorset. Many of the traditional dishes originate from the 17th and 18th centuries. At this time, much of the workforce were employed as agricultural labourers and, though they produced most of the food, their diet was poor. The gentry, unique in being able to shop for produce, and farmers, fared better. Despite this, until the early 19th century at least, simple foods, such as bread, comprised a sizeable part of the diet of all classes. History=Middle Ages Dorset's poor would have mostly eaten pigs as their meat in medieval times, as they were easy to rear. A rural county, Dorset would have been typical of England in the Middle Ages, and its population would have eaten similarly to the rest of the country. Bread was the staple food, and it came in two main categories: white and \\"other breads\\". White breads were the finest quality breads and would have been made using wheat and then well-sifted flour;Black, p. 6. \\"other breads\\" were a mixture of breads which also contained wheat (though the flour would not have been sifted as much), husk and other grains. The most commonly eaten bread, called maslin, was of the \\"other\\" category and contained wheat and rye. Seafood and fish were important, not least because they could be eaten during Lent and Fridays, unlike meat.Black, p. 8. Red meats were preferable to white meats, and amongst the former beef was the most favoured. Pigs were eaten primarily by the poor, especially during winter, because of their ease in rearing. Poultry was widely enjoyed, particularly by the clergy, who were permitted to eat \\"two-legged\\" but not \\"four-legged\\" meat.Black, p. 10. 17th and 18th centuries While some of the recipes which comprise the traditional cuisine of Dorset originate from the Middle Ages, the majority come from the 17th and 18th centuries.Draper, pp. 40-139. Within the sources in which recipes are recorded (recipe books, diaries), there is considerable bias towards the cooking habits of gentry, even in those of 17th- and 18th-century origin; the upper classes of society were more literate and able to purchase the variety of ingredients which would necessitate a cookery book. Although labourers and their families were the largest section of the population in Dorset (even after mechanisation in the middle of the 19th century), their low wages could not facilitate elaborate cooking and there was widespread illiteracy. Information on the dietary habits of the working class during the 17th and 18th centuries is usually gained incidentally, such as in reports on the state of the poor in the county. One of the earliest detailed reports on the diet of a Dorset labourer, by Sir Frederick Eden in 1795, describes an impoverished position: Such a situation continued until at least as late as 1868, when an inquiry was held into the food of the labourers. In fact, prior to the introduction of the potato, the diet of the labourers had been less favourable; in 1869, one investigator noted that before this: \\"the labourers had very little beside bread and cheese and water\\".Draper, p. 9. As recorded by John Bright in 1844, many families in the county managed on 10 shillings per week, of which at least half was spent on bread. Despite this, reports of the 18th and 19th century accuse \\"the poor\\" of being wasteful: \\"making cakes without yeast, and broiling or baking them on a gridiron, by which means it is said the quantity is lessened.\\" Whilst food in a workhouse was considered the worst possible in the county, no one starved inside and people did outside.Draper, p. 11. Though the instructions of the Poor Law Commissioner were to prevent the diet of the workhouse residents from being \\"superior or equal to the ordinary mode of subsistence of the labouring classes\\", in 1844 it was complained that \\"the diet [of our Union] at the present time, [is] somewhat superior to that obtainable by many Independent Labourers\\". However, while the food provided in a workhouse was adequate, it was plain and lacked fruit and vegetables. At the higher end of the county's cuisine was food cooked and prepared in the farmhouses (\\"farmhouse food\\"), seen as the home of traditional cooking in the 19th century. A far greater variety of ingredients were available for cooking, and, by the 18th century, ovens could be found in many farmhouses.Draper, p. 31. Playwright John O'Keeffe described his lunch in 1791 at the Red Lion Inn at West Lulworth, which had its own farm, as: It might be expected that when King George III spent his summer holidays in Weymouth, as he did often between 1789 and 1805, the height of cuisine would accompany him. However, by this time suffering from illness, the King ate plainly. Among his favourite foods from the area were Radipole biscuits, pudding at the Portland Arms (which came to be known as \\"Royal Pudding\\"),Draper, pp. 14-16. and Portland sheep (also \\"Portland mutton\\").Feasey, p. 83.

Contents The web portal presented articles (mainly written by Polish Catholic priest Henryk Jankowski who was banned from preaching for a year, after he said Poles should not tolerate a Jewish minority in the Polish government) propagating anti-Semitism, as well as a \\"List of Jews in Oppressed Poland\\" (\\"Lista zydow w zniewalanej Polsce\\"), which showed so-called \\"real Jewish surnames\\" of many well-known Polish public people next to their \\"new\\" Polish surnames, including their biographies dating back to the period before the Second World War. Journalist Adam Michnik, historian and politician Bronisław Geremek, former president Aleksander Kwaśniewski and former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki appeared on that list. The list was an inspiration for poster titled \\"Żydzi won z katolickiego kraju\\" (\\"Jews, get out of a Catholic country!\\") by Polish Street art artist Peter Fuss. See the poster The poster was displayed in Koszalin in 2007 with the aim of encouraging people to see an exhibition on Anti- Semitism.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80269,3878454.html The exhibition caused great controversies and was closed before opening by the police.

Main statement A statement that Poland and its economy remained under control of people of Jewish origin was a thematic predominant feature of the portal. On the main page one could read that these people were aspiring for destroying Polish tradition, as well as being definitely against social conservatism and a strong position of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the authors of Polonica.net, people of Jewish origin were the main threat to Poland and its independence, therefore the web portal supported the idea of expelling Jews from Poland once and for all. Closing The portal was shut down in 2010 although there were attempts to shut down the portal by Polish police since 2007 without success. The reason for that was that polonica.net was installed on American server and the administrator of portal was outside the country.

The process used a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of oil shale into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue. The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moves from the bottom upward to the top, countercurrent to the descending hot gases, by a mechanism known as a rock pump. The process technology was invented by the American oil company Unocal Corporation in late 1940s and was developed through several decades. The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort. History Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) started its oil shale activities in 1920s. In 1921, it acquired an oil shale tract in the Parachute Creek area of Colorado, southern Piceance Basin. The development of the Union process began in the late 1940s, when the Union A retort was designed. This technology was tested between 1954 and 1958 at the company-owned tract in the Parachute Creek. During these tests, up to 1,200 tonne per day of oil shale was processed, resulting of shale oil, which was refined at a Colorado refinery. More than of gasoline and fuels were produced. This production was finally shut down in 1961 due to cost. In 1974, the Union B process, evolved from the Union A process, was developed. In 1976, Union announced its plans to build a Union B demonstration plant. Construction started in 1981 at Long Ridge in Garfield County, Colorado, and the plant was started its operations in 1986. It was closed in 1991 after production of shale oil. Process The Union process can be operated in two different combustion modes, which are direct and indirect. The Union A (direct) process is similar to the gas combustion retort technology, classified as an internal combustion method, while the Union B (indirect) process is classified as an externally generated hot gas method. The Union retort is a vertical shaft retort. The main difference to other vertical shaft retorts such as Kiviter, Petrosix, Paraho and Fushun is that crushed oil shale is fed through the bottom of the retort rather than the top. Lumps of oil shale in size of are moved upwards through the retort by a solids pump (known as a \\"rock pump\\"). Hot gases, generated by internal combustion or circulated through the top of the retort, decompose the oil shale while descending. The pyrolysis occurs at the temperature of to . Condensed shale oil and gases are removed from the retort at the bottom. Part of the gases is recirculated for pyrolysis and fueling combustion, while other part could be used as product gas. The spent shale is removed from the top of the retort. After cooling with a water, it is conveyed to the waste disposal. Advantages The Union retort design has several advantages. The reducing atmosphere in the retort allows the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds through the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Oil vapors are cooled by the raw oil, thus minimizing polymer formation among the hydrocarbon fractions.

The main H-plan range was built for Bennet Sherard c.1670 and remodelled by the 4th Earl of Harborough c.1776. The orangery was added c.1820 and additional ranges were added by architect John Thomas Micklethwaite for brewer John Gretton in 1894–98. Stapleford Park had passed down in the Sherard and Tamblyn family since 1402. The 3rd Baron Sherard was made Earl of Harborough in 1719, the title expiring on the death of the 6th Earl in 1859. The estate was then bought in 1885 by James Hornsby and sold in 1894 to John Gretton, who carried out much alteration and new building. His son, John Gretton, MP, who succeeded him in 1899, subsequently became Baron Gretton. American fast-food restaurateur and hotelier Bob Payton bought the house from Lord Gretton in 1988 to convert it into a hotel. He restored the buildings, according to his obituary \\"hiring Wedgwood, Turnbull & Asser, Crabtree & Evelyn to decorate its rooms\\".Bob Payton's obituary in The Independent St Mary Magdalene's Church in the park was built in 1783 by George Richardson for the 4th Earl Harborough.Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyStapleford Park web site Lord Harborough's Curve Stapleford Miniature Railway The 6th Earl objected to a proposal in 1844 to run the Syston and Peterborough Railway through Stapleford Park along the course of the River Eye. Its construction would threaten the struggling Oakham Canal, of which he was a shareholder. The dispute led to a series of brawls and confrontations between the Earl's men and canal employees on one side and the railway's surveyors on the other with up to 300 involved in each skirmish. The dispute has been called the \\"Battle of Saxby\\".Kingscott, G., (2006) Lost Railways of Leicestershire and Rutland, Newbury: Countryside Books Eventually the railway ran around Stapleford Park in what is known as \\"Lord Harborough's Curve\\". The tight bend was a nuisance for the express trains, and later when the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway built a branch to Saxby, the opportunity was taken to reduce the curve, with Saxby station being moved in the process. Lord Harborough had died in the meantime and the estate had been bought by Lord Gretton, who was more sympathetic to the railway. In 1958, the Stapleford Miniature Railway was constructed by the 2nd Lord Gretton in the parkland, as part of a public attraction which also included a lion reserve. The park and house became a major tourist attraction through the 1960s and 70s. The park though closed in 1982 and the house was sold to become an exclusive country hotel. The railway and parkland, however, are still owned by the Gretton family, and open for charity a few times a year.

Diagnosis Phragmoceratids are characterized by generally compressed, upwardly curved endogastric shells with slit-like apertures for egress and ventral siphuncles with broadly expanded segments, thick connecting rings, and small to vestigial bullettes. Phragmoceratids are morphologically similar in regards to their constricted apertures to the more cylindrical and orthoconic Mandaloceratidae, also discosorids, and to the oncocerid Hemiphragmoceratidae (Sweet 1964); both which also come from the Silurian. Derivation The Phragmoceratidae are derived from the Ordovician Cyrtogomphoceratidae which are also endogastric but with open, unconstricted apertures and well-developed bullettes in the siphuncle. Phylogeny The family has its beginning with the Middle Silurian Protophragmoceras, known from a gradually and evenly expanding endogastric shell with an unrestricted aperture, like that of ts cyrtogomphoceratid ancestors, deep sharp hyponomic sinus for the water-jet funnel, and ventral siphuncle, phragmoceratid in character. Protophragmoceras gave rise to the Middle Silurian Phragmoceras, which gave rise to the closely related Middle Silurian Tubiferoceras and to the Upper Silurian Pristeroceras and Phragmocerina. Protophagmoceras also gave rise to the less characteristic but still included Middle Silurian Endoplectoceras and Sthenoceras, which extends into the Lower Devonian. Genera Phragmoceras, type genus, is known by it moderately large, strongly curved, rapidly enlarging, endogastric and compressed shell with a vertically constricted aperture that opens up at either end. The siphuncle is close to the concave ventral margin, segments broadly expanded, connecting rings thick, bullettes identifiable. Tubiferoceras is similar to Phragmocreas except that the dorsal expansion of the aperture sits on a tubular extension and the shell is straighter and more rapidly expanding. Pristeroceras differs from Phragmoceras in having a crenulated margin to the aperture. Phragmocerina is less compressed than Phragmoceras but with a similar aperture and like Phragmoceras is endogastric in the early stages but becomes straight in the later. Endoplectoceras is similar to Protophragmoceras except the shell is more slender and has faint trochoidal coiling. Sthenoceras has a fairly large, smooth endogastric shell, more strongly curved in the early stages, aperture that is only slightly contracted, and siphuncle with variably expanded segments and small bulletes. Contemporary cephalopods include oncocerids, barrandeocerids, orthocerids, and actinocerids. References *Rousseau H. Flower & Curt Teichert, 1957.

In the late 1860s, the Buckeyes were a skilled baseball team and were starting to make themselves known nationally. In 1868, they had won 21 games and lost only 5. However, when another local team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, decided to field an all-professional team in 1869, it spelled the end for the amateur Buckeyes. In fact, Buckeye stars Charlie Gould, Charlie Sweasy, Andy Leonard and Dick Hurley left the team to join the Red Stockings. The Buckeyes considered going professional themselves, but did not have the resources to do so. After some humiliating defeats against the rival Red Stockings in 1869, the club folded in 1870. Star pitcher Cherokee Fisher played for the Buckeyes in 1868. In 1869, the Buckeyes played on \\"Iron Slag\\" grounds, near today's Union Terminal.

The history of the development of Armenian sport and gymnastics in the Ottoman Empire began by the end of 19th century, when the first athletic clubs and societies were established. Under the rule of the Sultan, being engaged in sports or athletics was strictly forbidden and those who broke this law were punished. First Clubs After the coup d'état of Young Turks in 1908, the first Armenian athletic clubs and football teams were formed in Constantinople and Smyrna. In 1911-1914, four Armenian Olympic Games were held in Constantinople. From 1911 to 1914, Shavarsh Chrisyan published the Marmnamarz sports magazine. It was the first sports periodical in the Ottoman Empire . Its name Marmnamarz meant sport in Armenian. For the first time in the history of Turkish Olympic Games, two Armenian sportsmen--Vahram Papazyan and Mkrtich Mkryan represented Ottoman Turkey in the Fifth International Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912. In 1915-1920, many Armenian sportsmen became victims of the genocide and most of the Armenian sports clubs were shut down. Before The Great War On the eve of World War I there were about 40 Armenian athletic clubs in Constantinople. Armenian football teams took part in team and international tournaments of several leagues in the capital. The most famous football teams were “Balta Liman”, “Araks” and “Torq”. The most famous team of Smyrna was “Hay Vorsordats Club” (“The Armenian Hunters’ club\\"). Armenian sport clubs were established also in Smyrna (İzmir), Nicomedia (İzmit), Karin (Erzurum), Marzvan (Merzifon), Samson, Adana, Van, Caesarea (Kayseri), Dortyol (Dörtyol), Trapizon (Trabzon), Konya etc. In 1911-1914 the Pan-Armenian Olympic Games were organized with the participation of tens of Armenian sport and athletic clubs and societies. During the Games records were held and the winners were awarded with silver medals. In 1914, Armenia also held the first “Cilician Olympic Games”. Many Armenian sportsmen fell victims to the Armenian Genocide. Among them was Shavarsh Krissian, the editor of Marmnamarz, and after it the publication of the magazine was stopped.

Hellman & Friedman's strategy was to buy companies heavy on intellectual acumen (typically financial services or software companies) and light on physical assets (such as manufacturers) with strong cash flows that need operational improvements. In 1995, the firm purchased Levi Strauss & Co. from 250 family shareholders and consolidated it among four men including Hellman and then-CEO Robert D. Haas. The company reduced its debt and improved its earnings. Family history Though his fortune was largely self-made, Hellman was the great-grandson of Isaias W.

Upon winning the Juan Rulfo Prize, the award jury called him \\"one of the most important writers of his generation\\". Early life Cintio Vitier was born to Medardo and María Cristina Bolaños Vitier on September 25, 1921, in Key West, Florida, United States, but had Cuban nationality. Vitier attended a school started by his father in Matanzas, Cuba. He said that the school's library inspired his early literary inspiration. At fifteen, Vitier moved with his family to Havana and attended La Luz, a private school, and later a public secondary school. In 1947, he graduated as an attorney from the University of Havana. Vitier founded the journal Luz, allowing him to publish his work. At 17, he published Poemas, a book of his poetry. Poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, who was in exile at the time, wrote the introduction and chose the poems. Career Vitier began as a writer of hermetic poetry. Other themes in his poetry included the nature of poetry, the function of memory, and the role of language in the creative process. After Fidel Castro's revolution, critics said that Vitier captured the spirit of the revolution without resorting to propaganda. Vitier helped start the Cuban poetry magazine Origenes. Among his works are the books of poetry: Extrañeza de estar (\\"The wonder of being\\", 1944); Vísperas (\\"Vespers\\", 1953); Canto llano (\\"Plain song\\", 1956); Testimonios (1968), an anthology of his works from 1953 to 1968; La Fecha al Pie (1981), covering his works from 1969 to 1975; Antología Poética (1981); and Poemas de Mayo a Junio (1990). The most prominent of his works on Cuban poetry are Cincuenta años de poesía cubana, 1902–1952 (\\"Fifty years of Cuban poetry, 1902–1952\\"), Lo cubano en la poesía (\\"The Cuban element in poetry\\", 1958), as well as the novel Peña Pobre. Vitier won the National Prize for Literature (1988), the Order of José Marti awarded by the Cuban Council of State, the Juan Rulfo Prize (2002), and the medal of the Cuban Academy of Sciences. He also received the title of Official of Arts and Letters of France. Family and later life Vitier's son is Sergio Vitier one of the most important composers in Latin America and Jose Maria Vitier a well-known composer. To celebrate his last birthday, a bibliographic exhibition was opened at the Cuban National Library. Vitier died on October 1, 2009, at the age of 88 in Havana. He had made an appearance the week before with his wife, poet Fina García Marruz. His death was first reported by local television stations without additional details. Fidel and Raul Castro sent floral wreaths dedicated to Vitier. Works in English In June 2013, José Martí, Cuban Apostle: A Dialogue, was published by I.B Tauris of London. In the book, Vitier and Japanese writer Daisaku Ikeda explore the life, work and influence of José Martí (1853-1895) the Cuban independence hero, and discuss the nature of sacrifice for the sake of a great cause. Vitier and Ikeda met in Havana and in Tokyo, Japan, and their dialogue was initially serialized in Ushio, a Japanese literary magazine, between June 1999 and April 2000. The Japanese edition of their discussions was compiled and published as a book in August 2001, and Diálogo sobre José Martí, el Apóstol de Cuba, the Spanish edition, was published in Cuba in October 2001 and in the Dominican Republic in May 2002.

The choir was founded by Colin Jones on 1 September 1991 at a meeting in the Lecture Theatre, of Plas Coch College (later Glyndwr University) and composed of singers whom Colin had taught and conducted previously in choirs across North Wales. The first public performance was in the William Aston Hall, Wrexham, N Wales in February 1993 and following invites from across the world for concerts, the name was supplemented with \\"The North Wales Male Chorus\\". In 1996 they toured Australia and followed this with performances in Washington & Los Angeles (USA) to Singapore and Italy. The choir are also regular supporters of cultural events in Wales, performing to raise money for the National Eisteddfod of Wales. Their first CD contained their most requested pieces and was issued under the \\"Famous Welsh Choirs\\" banner under the Black Mountain Record label. In 2003 the choir released their \\"In Concert\\" (Mewn Cyngerdd) CD featuring the items most performed in concerts. After a long and successful period as its original founder and choral architect Colin Jones retired in November 2008. Following Colin's retirement, Cantorion Colin Jones was extremely fortunate in obtaining the services of John Daniel as its new Musical Director in early 2009. John hailed from Rhosllannerchrugog, the same village as Colin and shares many of his predecessors talents and musical gifts. The transition was smooth and highly successful and the choir continued to add to its growing reputation as a popular, entertaining and exciting male chorus. The choir released their third CD \\"Nessun Dorma\\" in 2011, the first under the baton of John Daniel. In 2011, he also introduced his first Male Voice Choir Workshop in Llanrwst, in the Conwy valley where members of the public were invited to join the ranks of the Cantorion during a rehearsal. In 2012 John Daniel retired and the choir appointed Aled Wyn Edwards as its third musical director. At the AGM in 2015, the choir rebranded as Cantorion Gogledd Cymru.

He was the senior vice president of baseball operations and general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2010 to 2015, for whom he began as a scouting coordinator in 2003. Prior to the Blue Jays, Anthopoulos got his start in professional baseball with the Montreal Expos organization in 2000. In 2015, he was named the Sporting News Executive of the Year after the Blue Jays advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1993, reaching the American League Championship Series (ALCS). However, his term with the Blue Jays ended on October 29, 2015, when he declined a five-year contract extension. He served for two years as vice president of player development for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Career=Montreal Expos (2000–2003) In 2000, Anthopoulos was hired by the Montreal Expos as an unpaid intern, and worked sorting players' fan mail. After working in the mail room he would sit with the scouts at games and take notes, and was eventually moved to a scouting internship in Florida. In 2002, he was promoted to the Expos' scouting coordinator. He would leave the team at the end of the 2003 season, while working as the assistant scouting director. Toronto Blue Jays (2003–2015) Anthopoulos joined the Toronto Blue Jays in late 2003, as their scouting coordinator. After the 2005 season, he was promoted to assistant general manager (AGM) under J. P. Ricciardi. While he was serving as AGM, the Blue Jays acquired José Bautista and Edwin Encarnación, who both unexpectedly reached a career renaissance, establishing new levels of production and consistency that were key components of the Blue Jays' offense during Anthopoulos' time as GM. Bautista was the MLB home run leader from 2010–11, and, in each year from 2010 to 2015, was an All-Star and hit at least 27 home runs. Encarnacion hit at least 34 home runs each year from 2012 to 2015. = General Manager of Blue Jays = Anthopoulos in 2010 Anthopoulos became the Blue Jays' general manager in October 2009, after Ricciardi was fired. He began his tenure as the general manager by playing a major role in one of the biggest trades in Blue Jays history, \\"The Doc Deal\\". In the deal, Anthopoulos traded Roy Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies for Kyle Drabek, Michael Taylor, and Travis d'Arnaud. Anthopoulos was also instrumental in doubling the size of the Blue Jays' scouting department, growing it to 54 scouts in various positions. The 2010 draft, the first with Anthopoulos in charge, resulted in a highly successful draft with a number of players picked eventually enjoying significant playing careers in the majors, including Aaron Sanchez and Noah Syndergaard. The Jays' first season with Anthopoulos at the helm resulted in an 85–77 record, good for fourth place in the American League (AL) East division. The club hit a franchise-record 257 home runs, the third-highest single-season total by any club in Major League history. In January 2011, Anthopoulos completed a blockbuster trade by shipping another long-time face of the Blue Jays franchise, Vernon Wells, and the remaining US$86 million over the next four years to the Los Angeles Angels for catcher Mike Napoli and outfielder Juan Rivera. He then sent Napoli to the Texas Rangers for pitcher Frank Francisco, and later traded Rivera to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. In July 2011, Anthopoulos made two successive trades to acquire center fielder Colby Rasmus from the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first, the Blue Jays traded pitching prospect Zach Stewart and reliever Jason Frasor to the Chicago White Sox for starting pitcher Edwin Jackson and infielder Mark Teahen. Jackson was then traded with outfielder Corey Patterson, and relief pitchers Marc Rzepczynski and Octavio Dotel to the Cardinals for Rasmus and relief pitchers Brian Tallet, P.J. Walters and Trever Miller. Before the 2012 Major League Baseball season, Anthopoulos was known to make trades in order to acquire supplemental draft picks. The most prominent example was when he acquired Miguel Olivo, a Type B free agent, and declined his club option the next day making Olivo a free agent. The Blue Jays gained a supplemental first-round draft pick when Olivo signed with the Seattle Mariners, taking Dwight Smith, Jr.. In November 2012, Anthopolous completed a blockbuster deal with the Miami Marlins, acquiring shortstop Jose Reyes, pitchers Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, catcher John Buck, and infielder/outfielder Emilio Bonifacio in exchange for shortstop Yunel Escobar, pitcher Henderson Alvarez, catcher Jeff Mathis and four minor- league prospects. Cash was also sent to the Jays in the trade. In December 2012, Anthopoulos acquired the 2012 National League Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey in a trade with the New York Mets that sent prospects Travis d'Arnaud, Noah Syndergaard, minor leaguer Wuilmer Becerra and Buck to New York. Toronto also received catcher Josh Thole and minor league catcher Mike Nickeas in the trade. As part of the transaction, the Blue Jays signed Dickey to an extension worth a total of $29 million over three years with a $12 million fourth year option. In 2013, the Blue Jays finished at 74–88, in last place in the AL East. The next year, they improved to 83–79 and third place. During the 2014 offseason, Anthopoulos traded Canadian third baseman Brett Lawrie, along with three prospects, to the Oakland Athletics for Josh Donaldson. In July 2015, he acquired Troy Tulowitzki and LaTroy Hawkins from the Colorado Rockies in exchange for Jose Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, and Miguel Castro. On July 30, he acquired star left-handed pitcher David Price from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd, and Jairo Labourt. The next day, Anthopoulos traded for outfielder Ben Revere, and in August, acquired shortstop Cliff Pennington. Price went 9–1 with a 2.30 earned run average in innings pitched for the Blue Jays. The Blue Jays, who had a 50–51 record on July 28, won 43 of their final 61 games to overtake the New York Yankees and win the AL East division crown for their first playoff appearance in 22 seasons. With Donaldson, Bautista, and Encarnación (the latter two acquired by previous GM J.P. Ricciardi) each hitting at least 39 home runs in 2015, the Blue Jays led the major leagues in scoring at 5.50 runs per game. Toronto's season ended in an American League Championship Series (ALCS) loss to the Kansas City Royals. Donaldson was named the 2015 American League Most Valuable Player. Anthopoulos rejected a five-year extension from the Blue Jays organization on October 29, 2015, and did not publicly reveal the reasons for his decision. He later said \\"I just think there's certain things that should remain private and behind closed doors, and I know sometimes that's hard to hear and hard to understand. I just think it's the right thing for the organization and the ball club and everybody involved.\\" There was some speculation that his departure was due to the belief that he would not have full autonomy under new president/CEO Mark Shapiro. According to The Globe and Mail, \\"The talk around the water cooler is that Anthopoulos wanted the same job and responsibility that he had under Beeston, who hired him as GM. That was having the ultimate say in all baseball-related decisions.\\" Shapiro refuted these claims on November 1, stating \\"It's not about autonomy, it's about collective success\\". He also denied suggestions that he \\"scolded\\" Anthopoulos over several deadline trades involving Blue Jays' top prospects. Toronto's combined win–loss record was 489–483 while Anthopoulos was GM. On October 29, 2015, Sporting News named him Executive of the Year as selected by a panel of 47 major league executives.  Los Angeles Dodgers (2016–2017)  On January 12, 2016, Anthopoulos was hired as the vice-president of baseball operations by the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Atlanta Braves (2017–present)  On November 13, 2017, Anthopoulos was hired as the executive vice president and general manager of the Atlanta Braves after agreeing on a four-year contract. The Braves promoted Anthopoulos to president of baseball operations in February 2020, and extended his contract to the 2024 season. Personal Anthopoulos is of Greek Canadian descent, born in Montreal, Quebec to John Anthopoulos, who owned a heating and ventilation company until his death in 1998. He is the youngest of three sons, and holds a degree in economics from McMaster University. Anthopoulos married Cristina in 2010, with whom he has two children. International Anthopoulos served as an advance scout for the Greek National Baseball Team for the 2004 Summer Olympics; which finished in 7th place.

History Dirk van Hogendorp The Commission was established on 1 July 1812 by order of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Its chief tasks included the creation of Lithuanian armed forces, and the provisioning of Napoleon's troops. The provinces of Vilnius, Grodno, Minsk and Białystok were attached to the jurisdiction of the government of Lithuania. The Provisional Government of Lithuania had no connections to Poland. Supervision of the Commission was entrusted to the former French Resident in the Duchy of Warsaw, Commissioner Louis Pierre Édouard Bignon. Actual power, however, was exercised by Dutch General Dirk van Hogendorp, former governor of Java, who was appointed governor of Vilnius. Napoleon, contrary to the hopes reposed in him by the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, had not restored Polish statehood to the former Polish–Lithuanian lands. He had merely established, in the conquered territories, a provisional administration, thereby sidestepping final dispositions pending his further conquest of Russia. Józef Wybicki, sent on 11 July 1812 to Vilnius with a deputation from the Council of the General Confederation, unsuccessfully attempted to get the Emperor to declare the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, including the territories that had been annexed in the Partitions of Poland. Napoleon also refused to attach the military units consisting of Lithuanians to the Polish ones. Only on 14 July 1812 did the Commission formally subordinate itself to the Council of the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland. After Russian troops invaded Lithuanian territory at the end of 1812, the Lithuanian government acted outside Lithuania.

(1559 – 1631) was an English churchman and courtier, a royal chaplain and archdeacon of Berkshire, imprisoned for sedition in 1614. As a writer he took a strong anti-papal and anti-Spanish line. Life He was second son of Robert Sharpe, a merchant, of London, and of Julian, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Mallorie, lord mayor. He entered Eton College in 1576, and proceeded as fellow to King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1581, M.A. in 1584, and received from the university the degree of D.D. before 1603. He was incorporated at Oxford on 12 October 1618.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Scadden-Sheyne In 1588 he was present at Tilbury camp in the capacity of chaplain to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and was chosen, as he states, to repeat Queen Elizabeth's oration to the whole army assembled there. In 1589 and in 1596 he accompanied Essex in his expeditions to Cadiz and Portugal. In 1590 Sharp became rector of Malpas, Cheshire, and in 1597 of Tiverton and Stoke-in-Teignhead in Devon. When Essex was executed for treason, Sharp was banished to his Devon parishes. In May 1601, in a letter to Robert Cecil, he excused himself, and was soon after appointed a royal chaplain. Sharp celebrated the commencement of James I's reign by a laudatory sermon on Solomon and the queen of Sheba, at St. Mary's. He obtained the patronage of Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. In 1605 he became archdeacon of Berkshire and rector of North Moreton in that county. He was also about this time appointed chaplain to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and addressed to him a congratulatory epistle to him on his escape from the Gunpowder Plot. His career at court soon terminated after Prince Henry's death in 1612. Already, in 1606, he had been summoned to clear himself to the council of the suspicion of endeavouring to stir up strife between the English and the Scottish factions at court. In 1614 John Hoskins speaking in parliament concerning Scottish favourites, made an allusion to the Sicilian Vespers. On being called to account he pleaded that he did not understand the nature of his threat, but that it had been suggested to him by Sharp. Both Hoskins and Sharp, together with Sir Charles Cornwallis, who was also implicated, were committed to the Tower of London on 22 June. Sharp's health suffered from confinement, but he was not released till 15 June of the following year. Sharp made several attempts to regain favour by means of obsequious sermons. He also wrote to the king and to various ministers, advocating the adoption of Elizabeth's domestic policy. In 1618, according to Chamberlain, he penned the defence of Sir Lewis Stukeley against the charge of betraying Sir Walter Ralegh. In the same year the university of Oxford conferred on him the honorary degree of D.D. In his later years he resided at Boughton Malherb in Kent, one of his parishes. There he died on 1 January 1631, and was buried in the church, a marble monument marking his grave. About 1597 he had married Ann, daughter of John Chichester of Hall in Devon.

Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important: *Topic creator - A publication that created a new topic *Breakthrough - A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly *Influence - A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of cryptography. Cryptanalysis=The index of coincidence and its applications in cryptology * Description: Presented the index of coincidence method for codebreaking; number 22 in the Riverbank Publications series. Treatise on the Enigma * Description: The breaking of the Enigma. The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing * Description: Almost nothing had been published in cryptography in several decades and very few non-government researchers were thinking about it. The Codebreakers, a popular and non academic book, made many more people aware and contains a lot of technical information, although it requires careful reading to extract it. Its 1967 appearance was followed by the appearance of many papers over the next few years. Differential Cryptanalysis of DES-like Cryptosystems * Description: The method of differential cryptanalysis. A new method for known plaintext attack of FEAL cipher * Description: The method of linear cryptanalysis. Theory=Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems * Description: Information theory based analysis of cryptography. The original form of this paper was a confidential Bell Labs report from 1945, not the one published. Probabilistic Encryption * Description: The paper provides a rigorous basis to encryption (e.g., partial information) and shows that it possible to equate the slightest cryptanalysis to solve a pure math problem. Second, it introduces the notion of computational indistinguishability. Proofs that Yield Nothing But their Validity or All Languages in NP have Zero-Knowledge Proofs * Description: This paper explains how to construct a zero-knowledge proof system for any language in NP. Private key cryptography=Cryptographic Coding for Data-Bank Privacy * Description: Feistel ciphers are a form of cipher of which DES is the most important. It would be hard to overestimate the importance of either Feistel or DES. Feistel pushed a transition from stream ciphers to block ciphers. Although most ciphers operate on streams, most of the important ciphers today are block ciphers at their core. Data Encryption Standard * NBS Federal Standard FIPS PUB 46, 15 Jan 1977. Description: DES is not only one of the most widely deployed ciphers in the world but has had a profound impact on the development of cryptography. Roughly a generation of cryptographers devoted much of their time to attacking and improving DES. Public Key Cryptography=New directions in cryptography * Description: This paper suggested public key cryptography and presented Diffie–Hellman key exchange. For more information about this work see: W.Diffie, M.E.Hellman, \\"Privacy and Authentication: An Introduction to Cryptography\\", in Proc. IEEE, Vol 67(3) Mar 1979, pp 397–427. On the Signature Reblocking Problem in Public Key Cryptography * Description: In this paper (along with Loren M. Kohnfelder,\\"Using Certificates for Key Distribution in a Public-Key Cryptosystem\\", MIT Technical report 19 May 1978), Kohnfelder introduced certificates (signed messages containing public keys) which are the heart of all modern key management systems. Secure Communications Over Insecure Channels * Description: This paper introduced a branch of public key cryptography, known as public key distribution systems. Merkle's work predated \\"New directions in cryptography\\" though it was published after it. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange is an implementation of such a Merkle system. Hellman himself has arguedhttp://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid14_gci1077600,00.html that a more correct name would be Diffie–Hellman–Merkle key exchange. A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public Key Cryptosystems * Description: The RSA encryption method. The first public-key encryption method. How to Share a Secret * Description: A safe method for sharing a secret. On the security of public key protocols * Description: Introduced the adversarial model against which almost all cryptographic protocols are judged. Protocols=Using encryption for authentication in large networks of computers * Description: This paper introduced the basic ideas of cryptographic protocols and showed how both secret-key and public-key encryption could be used to achieve authentication. Kerberos * * Description: The Kerberos authentication protocol, which allows individuals communicating over an insecure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure and practical manner. A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection * A Dynamic Network Architecture * Description: Network software in distributed systems.

Originally from Munich, Germany, Scholz came on to the international stage in December 2007 in College Park, Maryland. Early life Philip Scholz was born in Munich, Germany, to parents Thomas and Ariane Scholz. At a young age, Philip was diagnosed with Stickler Syndrome, a genetic defect that can cause problems with the ears, eyes, throat, and joints. Philip went blind in his left eye at the age of six due to retinal detachments, brought on directly by Styckler Syndrome. Swimming career Philip's first swim team was the Three Village Swim Club (TVSC), coached by Barry Roffer, which he first joined in September 1998. Initially considered a sighted swimmer, he was easily able to fit right in on the team. After losing his sight, Philip continued swimming and graduated from TVSC in 2007. He then went on to swim for the Loyola Greyhounds Swim Team at Loyola University Maryland under coach Brian Loeffler. While on the team he helped the Greyhounds to 3 straight Men's MAAC Swimming and Diving titles.http://www.loyolagreyhounds.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/021911aab.html Philip's first Paralympic meet was the Georgia Open in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2006. After becoming an American citizen in November 2007, Philip went on the international stage at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he set several long-course American records in the 50 meter butterfly, the 800 meter freestyle, and the 1500 meter freestyle. Before that, he had also set eight short course American records in Loyola's H2Ounds Invitational swim meet, setting times in the 50 yard freestyle, the 100 yard freestyle, the 200 yard freestyle, the 500 yard freestyle, the 1000 yard freestyle, the 1650 yard freestyle, the 100 yard butterfly, and the 200 yard butterfly. Philip Scholz represented the United States of America in the 2008 Paralympic Games in China, qualifying in the 50 meter freestyle, the 100 meter freestyle, the 400 meter freestyle, the 100 meter butterfly, and the 100 meter backstroke.

Biography=Early life Skarbimir was a son of Michal the Old of the Clan Abdank, one time comes, founder of a Benedictine monastery at Lubin.Bieniak J., Skarbimir, Polski Słownik Biograficzny, vol. 38, 1997, pp. 28 Very little is known of Skarbimir's childhood and early life. It is believed that in 1079 he along with his father traveled to Hungary accompanying the banished king Boleslaw II the Bold. He and his father are believed to have returned to Poland circa 1086 along with Mieszko Bolesławowic, the son of the banished monarch. Following the poisoning of Boleslawowic in 1089, the clan Abdank declared itself in the opposition of count palatine Sieciech who was believed to have ordered Mieszko Bolesławowic poisoned. Political involvement Skarbimir was politically active already during the reign of Władysław I Herman. It was through his initiative that a popular assembly was organized in Wroclaw where an agreement was reached between Bolesław III Wrymouth and his brother Zbigniew in their fight against count palatine Sieciech. It was there that he swore an oath of allegiance to both the sons of Władysław I Herman, and there he ratified the removal from office of the current guardian of Boleslaw, a noble named Wojsław Powała, who was a relative of Sieciech. The campaign against Palatine Sieciech, the de facto ruler of Poland, was also decided upon by Skarbimir at the Wroclaw meeting. As a consequence Skarbimir became the main advisor to Boleslaw III, which led to him taking over the office of palatine of the Lesser Poland- Silesian Duchy following the death of Wladyslaw I Herman. In 1103 as en envoy of Bolesław III Wrymouth, he negotiated with Borivoj II of Bohemia, who allied himself with Zbigniew and invaded Silesia. Skarbimir was a proponent of anti- Bohemian foreign policy. It was likely with his help and influence that a successful invasion of Bohemia took place in 1105. He was very influential, to the point that he even minted his own coin. According to Jan Długosz in 1106 the Duke appointed him the prestigious office of Voivode of Cracow. He remained Bolesław III Wrymouth’s faithful servant until 1117 when under unclear circumstances he rebelled against the Duke. The rebellion was suppressed, Skarbimir was captured and punished by being blinded. Rebellion against the duke The reason for the count palatine's rebellion of 1117–1118, though not clearly explained, is sometimes connected by historians to Bolesław III Wrymouth’s statute of succession. The problem with the principle of succession developed in 1115 when Leszek, Boleslaw's first son from his second marriage, was born. It is believed that Skarbimir was opposed to statutory regulation of royal inheritance. He believed that the choice of an heir should be decided by a council of magnates. Presumably he refused to pledge to abide by the decisions outlined in the statute of succession, for this he was removed from office and replaced as Count Palatine by Piotr Włostowic . At this point, it is supposed, Skarbimir was to begin his mutiny against the monarch. He did not gain many supporters, however, and the uprising was defeated. The above explanation, however, is only a hypothesis due to a lack of primary sources on the matter. Return to power and death Towards the end of 1121 Piotr Włostowic was stripped of his title of count palatine, which was once again granted to Skarbimir. Skarbimir's return to the lead of Polish elites is testified by his name being the first secular dignitary mentioned on the document of Papal legate Giles of Tusculum issued between 1123 and 1125 as well as his mention in the Liber Fraternitatis of Lubin. Skarbimir died on April 16; the day of his death was noted in the Lubin Obituary Book entitled Liber Mortuorum Abbatiae Sanctae Mariae Lubinensis. The year of his death is not known. It is known that he died during the reign of Bolesław III Wrymouth, since at the time of Boleslaw’s death the office of count palatine was held once again by Piotr Włostowic. It is supposed therefore, that since Wlostowic is believed to have regained the office in 1132, then Skarbimir's death must have taken place beforehand, sometime in 1131.Bieniak J., Skarbimir, Polski Słownik Biograficzny, vol. 38, 1997, pp. 30 Skarbimir is believed to have seven sons: Jaszczolt, Skarbimir, Przedwoj, Henryk, Szczedrzyk, Michal and Pakoslaw, as well as two daughters of unknown names.

It was built between 1905 and 1907 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It was destroyed in a massive fire on 22–23 October 1971. It had been re-equipped as a ring mill for spinning artificial fibres when it was destroyed. Location Texas mill was built next to Minerva Mill in Whitelands, in a meander of the River Tame. History The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. The syndicate then built Rock Mill, Atlas Mill, Curzon Mill, Tudor Mill, Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill. The syndicate registered the Texas Mill Co. Ltd, with a capital of GBP70,000 to build this, their seventh mill. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. On 7 January 1921 all the syndicate's mills went into voluntary liquidation and were passed to the Atlas Mills Ltd. group .London Gazette 7th Dec 1920 They were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Texas Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. It had been converted to rings and it produced 20 to 40 count high class combed and carded hosiery yarns. Later it converted to artificial fibres. Still spinning, was destroyed by fire 22–23 October 1971. The Texas Mill fire was one of the largest fires in the North West. Lancashire County Fire Service initially responded, but soon requested assistance from neighbouring brigades such was the size of the incident. Firefighters fought the blaze using about 40 pumps plus specials and relief appliances.

Architecture This was a 30 bay mill designed by Sydney Stott, it had his trademark double rings on its chimney. It was four storeys high built on a basement from engineering brick. It had a Hotel-de-Ville style water tower. The large windows were in groups of three, and there was yellow brick decoration. The six bay engine house, boiler house and chimney were to the north. Power The 1907 steam engine was by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw. It was built as a triple expansion at 1200 hp. It was altered in 1921 and became a 1500 hp vertical three cylinder compound engine. The later engine had a 28\\" diameter high pressure (HP) in the centre, with a 33\\" IP and 51\\"LP cylinder. It had a 4 ft stroke and ran at 78rpm. The boiler operated at 170psi. The 22 ft flywheel was mounted at end of shaft, driving 28 ropes. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. Air pumps were driven from LP and IP crossheads. In 1921 a new 51\\"LP cylinder was built, the old 21\\"HP removed and the IP was used for HP. Equipment The mule frames were provided by Hetherington and Sons Ltd. There were 76,896 mule spindles spinning medium counts of yarn from American cotton. By 1948, the mill had been re-equipped with 35,000 ring spindles.

The journal focuses on electrical engineering and computer science. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 9.107, ranking it sixth in the category \\"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic.\\" In 2018, it became fifth with an enhanced impact factor of 10.694.  History of the Proceedings  The journal was established in 1909, known as the Proceedings of the Wireless Institute. Six issues were published under this banner by Greenleaf Pickard and Alfred Goldsmith. Then in 1911, a merger between the Wireless Institute (New York) and the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (Boston) resulted in a society named the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). In January 1913 newly formed IRE published the first issue of the Proceedings of the IRE. Later, a 1000-page special issue commemorated the IRE's fiftieth anniversary in May 1962. One of the founding editors, Alfred Norton Goldsmith, tallied 42 years as the first editor-in- chief. When the IEEE was formed in 1963 as a merger of IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the journal obtained its current name.  Journal Content  Proceedings of the IEEE provides in-depth review, survey, and tutorial coverage of the technical developments in electronics, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science. * Reviews critically examine a technology, tracing its progress from its inception to the present—and perhaps into the future. * Surveys comprehensively view a technology—its applications, issues, ramifications, and potential. * Tutorials explain the technology and may give practical information for implementing it. The journal offers applications-oriented coverage that goes beyond the traditional boundaries typically found in other journals.  Special Issues and Regular Papers  The journal publishes approximately ten Special Issues and two regular paper issues per year. Special Issues are led by distinguished Guest Editor teams and contain articles from leading experts in the technology area being covered. They serve as a guide to the state-of-the-art and are highly valued by the core research community as well as specialists in other areas. Regular Paper Issues consist of three to four papers on more focused topics, giving readers background and insight into emerging areas.

The result of three years of work, the poem tells the Greek myth of Hero and Leander, two lovers, and the story of their forlorn fate. Hunt began working on the poem during the summer of 1816, arousing the interest of the publisher John Taylor, and despite repeated delays to allow Hunt to deal with other commitments the poem was finished and published in a collection 1819. Hunt later claimed in a poem about Bacchus and Ariadne that he was seeking to humanise myths and make them more understandable to the common people. The collection was well received by contemporary critics and poets, including Thomas Carlyle, while more modern writers such as Edmund Blunden have criticised the flow of its narrative. Background After the decline in circulation for his paper the Examiner following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, Hunt began to focus more on his poetry. During this time, he decided to write poems about the story of Bacchus and Ariadne along with the story of Hero and Leander. After starting on the poem about Hero and Leander during summer 1816, Hunt showed the lines to the publisher John Taylor who gave Hunt 20 guineas as a partial payment for a collection including the poem.Roe p. 265 A notice by Taylor and Hessey was sent to Hunt on 22 February 1817 asking about Bacchus and Ariadne. Percy Bysshe Shelley responded for Hunt to gain more time for Hunt to complete the volume. In June, Hunt devoted his time to work on the second edition of The Story of the Remini while hoping to finish the collection during winter 1818. However, the projected date was pushed back by the end of 1818.Roe p. 314 By July 1819, the poem, along with Hero and Leander, The Panther were finished and soon published.Roe pp. 293, 303, 316 Poem The poem begins with Ariadne waking into a half-conscious state:Edgecombe 1994 p. 107 The moist and quiet morn was scarcely breaking. When Ariadne in her bower was waking; Her eyelids still were closing, and she heard But indistinctly yet a little bird. That in the leaves o'erhead, waiting the sun. Seemed answering another distant one. She wakes, but stirred not, only just to please Her pillow-nestling cheek; while the full seas.  * * Her senses lingering in the feel of sleep; And with a little smile she seemed to say, 'I know my love is near me, and 'tis day.' At length, not feeling the accustomed arm. That from all sense of fancied want and harm Used to enclose her, when she turned that way. She stretched her hand to feel where Theseus lay. (lines 1–8, 12–18) When Ariadne realises that Theseus is not there, she immediately panics:Edgecombe 1994 pp. 108–109 But how? Not there? She starts with a small cry, And feels the empty space, and runs her eye O'er all the bower, and stretches from the bed One hasty foot, and listens with wild head. No sight—no voice: she tries to smile, heart-sick. And murmurs, 'Oh, 'tis but some hiding trick; He sees me through the boughs:' and so she rose. And, like a wood-nymph, through the glimmering goes. And for a while delays to call his name, Pretending she should spoil his amorous game; But stops at last, her throat full-pulsed with fears. And calls convulsively with bursting tears; Then calls again; and then in the open air Rushes, and fiercely calls. He is not there. (lines 22–35) She faints as she realises that Theseus has deserted her in a reversal of the opening:Edgecombe 1994 p. 109 The faithless bark, far off, leaning away. And now with gleaming sail, and now with dim. Hastening to slip o'er the horizon's brim. 'Tis gone; and as a dead thing, down falls she. In the great eye of morn, then breaking quietly. (lines 41–45) This leads into a discussion of various possibilities for Theseus's leaving, with an emphasis that he left in the name of patriotism:Edgecombe 1994 pp. 109–110 Some say that Theseus took this selfish flight From common causes — a cloyed appetite; Others, that having brought her sister there As well, he turned his easy love to her; And others, who are sure to quote Heaven's orders 50 For great men's crimes, though not for small disorders. Pretend that Bacchus in the true old way, A dream, advised him sternly not to stay. But go and cut up nations limb by limb. And leave the lady and the bower to him. One tiling looks certain,—that the chief that day Was not alone a skulking runaway. But left the woman that believed his smile To all the horrors of a desert isle. (lines 41–59) The poem continues with Ariadne's lament over her fate and she expresses the terror that she feels:Edgecombe 1994 pp. 110–111 'Oh, Theseus, Theseus!' then awhile she stopped, And turned, and in her hand her poor face dropped, Shaking her head, and cried, 'How could you go. And leave me here to die, that loved you so! I would not have left you, even for mirth. Not in the best and safest place on earth; Nor, had you been never so false a one, 90 Denied you this poor breast to lean upon; Much less for loving too confidingly; And yet, for nothing worse, have you left me; Left me—left Ariadne, sleeping too Fast by your side; and yet for you, for you, She left her father, country, home, and all. (lines 84–96) After Ariadne finds a crown that Theseus left before, the poem describes the arrival of Bacchus and his companions:Edgecombe 1994 p. 111 Suddenly from a wood his dancers rush. Leaping like wines that from the bottle gush; Bounding they come, and twirl, and thrust on high Their thyrsuses, as they would rouse the sky; And hurry here and there, in loosened bands, And trill above their heads their cymballed hands: Some, brawny males, that almost show from far Their forceful arms, cloudy and muscular; Some, smoother females, who have nevertheless Strong limbs, and hands, to fling with and to press; And shapes, which they can bend with heavenward glare. And tortuous wrists, and backward streaming hair. A troop of goat-foot shapes came trampling after. (lines 161–173) Bacchus shows Ariadne that his love is able to mend the pain of Theseus's betrayal:Roe p. 318 Bacchus took in his arms his bridal lass. And gave and shared as much more happiness Than Theseus, as a noble spirit's caress. Full of sincerity, and mind, and heart. Out-relishes mere fire and self-embittering art. (lines 339–343) The poem concludes with a cheerful philosophy that is symbolised in the image of Ariadne's immortalised crown:Edgecombe 1994 p. 113 The grateful god took off from his love's hair Her fervid crown; and with a leap i' the air, As when a quoiter springs to his firm eye. Whirled it in buzzing swiftness to the sky. Starry already, and with heat within, It fired as it flew up with that fierce spin. And opening into grandeur, round and even. Shook its immortal sparkles out of heaven.  * * The easy wear of inward gracefulness. Beneath this star, this star, where'er she be. Sits the accomplished female womanly: Part of its light is round about her hair; And should her gentle cheek be wet with care, The tears shall be kissed off, as Ariadne's were. (lines 346–353, 361–366) Themes In a poem to the 1832 version of the poems, Hunt uses verse to claim that he seeks to humanise myth to make it more understandable to the common person.Edgecombe 1994 p. 113 While many of the other works written by Hunt during the time had political themes that expressed his feelings about the actions of the British government, Bacchus and Ariadne was toned down and contained a \\"sociability\\" that was mentioned in the preface of Hunt's Foliage.Holden p. 136 When placed into a sequence following Hero and Leander, the Bacchus and Ariadne is a consolation to the themes of the first. Bacchus is able to save Ariadne, whereas no one was able to save Hero. Hunt relied on the story from Ovid's Heroides to base his poem, but Hunt describes an end result to the story that Ovid leaves untold. A major connection between Hunt's and Ovid's version is that they begin at sunrise. Ovid uses the sunrise to show that Ariadne is aware that she is alone in a stark manner whereas Hunt tones down the moment to show that Ariadne is in a half-conscious state. This continues further into the plot, as Ovid describes Ariadne's distress over Theseus's absence in graceful manner whereas Hunt imitates a panicked state. For the rest of the story involving Bacchus, Hunt's version is related to Titian's painting of Bacchus and Ariadne. This is especially true of Hunt's descriptions of Bacchus's arrival, which is very similar to Titian's painting.Edgecombe 1994 pp. 107–112 Hunt also differs from his sources in that he reproaches Theseus for his actions in the name of patriotism and religion. Hunt also claims that Theseus's abandonment of Ariadne was merely ploy that is similar to how modern governments use the same excuse for their misdeeds.Edgecombe 1994 pp. 108–110 Critical response The collection containing Bacchus and Ariadne was well received by contemporary critics with the London Magazine devoted a lengthy analysis to the works.Blainey 1985 p. 115 Thomas Carlyle, Hunt's contemporary, in the poem \\"Ode to a Friend\\", praised Hunt and emphasised Bacchus and Ariadne in the description.Blunden 1930 p. 259 In 1930, Edmund Blunden claimed that the poem was an \\"unequally written narrative\\".Blunden 1930 p. 140 Rodney Edgecombe, in 1994, claimed, \\"Hunt did well to choose Bacchus and Ariadne for his next poem, for the simple reason that the subject itself is comparatively static and makes few demands for that narrative upkeep, that exigency of plot by which Hunt sometimes appears to be embarrassed.\\" NotesReferences * Blainey, Ann.

He joined the Austrian military and fought against the Kingdom of Prussia, Ottoman Turkey, and the First French Republic. He was promoted to the rank of general officer during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the Napoleonic Wars, he led a division in 1805 and an army corps in 1809. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian cavalry regiment from 1802 to 1844. Early career Born into a princely family near Maastricht on 31 May 1757 in the modern-day Netherlands, Hohenzollern first joined the Dutch army in 1775. A year later, he entered the Habsburg service in his uncle's regiment, the Friedrich Anton of Hohenzollern-Hechingen Cuirassiers # 4. He later fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1783 he married Maria Theresia von Wildenstein. He served in the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791), becoming a Major in 1788. After fighting at Belgrade he was elevated in rank to Oberst-Leutnant in 1790.Smith- Kudrna, Hohenzollern-Hechingen French Revolutionary Wars=War of the First Coalition In 1793 Hohenzollern received promotion to Oberst (colonel) and fought at the battles of Neerwinden and Wattignies. The following year he was involved in the sieges of Landrecies and Charleroi. In 1795 he fought in the Army of the Upper Rhine. In 1796, Hohenzollern became a General-Major and transferred to the Italian theater. During the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May, he rallied the defeated soldiers and mounted a counterattack on the French in Valeggio sul Mincio. This action won time for the army commander, Johann Beaulieu to organize an orderly retreat.Boycott-Brown, p 354 During the Castiglione campaign, he commanded a brigade in the column of Johann Mészáros.Boycott-Brown, p 379 In the third relief attempt of the Siege of Mantua, Hohenzollern commanded the army's advance guard. He led his troops in a hard-fought victory over Napoleon Bonaparte during the Second Battle of Bassano on 6 November.Boycott-Brown, p 450 At the Battle of Caldiero on 12 November, Bonaparte attacked Hohenzollern's advance guard with two French divisions. Though initially outnumbered two-to-one, he managed to repulse repeated enemy attacks until Austrian reinforcements arrived and drove the French back into Verona.Boycott-Brown, pp 456-457 He played a lesser role in the Battle of Arcole, after which the Austrians were forced to retreat. In April 1797, the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa was awarded to him. War of the Second Coalition During the War of the Second Coalition, Hohenzollern again served in Italy. He commanded a brigade under Pál Kray in a battle at Legnago on 26 March 1799.Smith, p 150 He fought at the Battle of Magnano where he temporarily commanded a division.Rickard, Battle of Magnano He besieged the Milan citadel starting on 30 April and received its surrender on 24 May.Smith, p 156 On 12 June, with 4,300 soldiers, he attempted to block Jacques MacDonald's much larger French force at the Battle of Modena but was defeated with heavy losses.Smith, pp 158-159 He also fought at the battles of Trebbia and Novi. He won promotion to Feldmarschal-Leutnant in October 1799. Hohenzollern defeated Nicolas Soult at La Bochetta near Genoa on 9 April 1800 and at Sassello on 10 April. He participated in the Siege of Genoa under the overall command of Peter Ott. On 13 May, Hohenzollern defeated and captured Soult at Monte Creto, ending a series of successful French sorties.Smith, 183 After the fall of Genoa in early June, Ott appointed him commander of the captured port. After Bonaparte's decisive victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, Genoa passed into French hands again. Hohenzollern fought at the Battle of Pozzolo in December 1800. In 1802, he became the proprietor of Chevau-léger Regiment Nr. 2 and held the position until his death. Napoleonic Wars=War of the Third Coalition During the War of the Third Coalition, Hohenzollern led a division in the corps of Franz von Werneck in Archduke Ferdinand's army. Deployed in southern Germany, the Austrian army was enveloped by Emperor Napoleon's Grand Army and crushed in the Ulm Campaign. Werneck tried to escape on the north bank of the Danube, but Marshal Joachim Murat launched a relentless pursuit. Hohenzollern's division fought on 16 October at Langenau and 17 October at Herbrechtingen.Smith, p 205 Murat caught up with the Austrians and surrounded them on 18 October 1805. When Werneck capitulated, Hohenzollern refused to obey the order to lay down his arms. Instead, he escaped into Bohemia with Archduke Ferdinand, Karl Schwarzenberg, and ten cavalry squadrons.Smith, p 206 His noble rank was raised from Graf to Prince in 1806, though he was not the reigning prince. War of the Fifth Coalition At the beginning of the War of the Fifth Coalition, Hohenzollern received appointment to the command of III Armeekorps in the south German theater.Bowden & Tarbox, p 67 He led his corps at the Battle of Teugen-Hausen on 19 April 1809. He also fought at the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April. After having traded corps with Johann Kollowrat, he led the II Armee Korps in the Austrian victory at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21–22 May.Bowden & Tarbox, p 89 This was the third time that Hohenzollern participated in a defeat of Napoleon, a rare distinction in 1809. In the climactic Battle of Wagram, he continued to lead his corps. In August 1809, Emperor Francis II promoted him to General of Cavalry (full general). 1812-1815 Hohenzollern commanded a corps in Galicia in 1812. During the latter part of 1813, he led a reserve corps, so he missed the campaign ending in the Battle of Leipzig and the 1814 campaign. When Europe mobilized against France during the Hundred Days, Hohenzollern received command of the II Armeekorps in Schwarzenberg's army but he saw little action. Later career Hohenzollern sat as President in the deliberations of the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council) from 1825 to 1830. He became a Feldmarschall on 18 September 1830. His wife Maria died in 1835. They had four children, Friedrich Franz Anton (1790-1847), Julia Fredericke (1792-1864), Friedrich Adalbert (1793-1819), and Josephine Fredericke (1795-1878). He died on 6 April 1844 in Vienna.

In 1982, he went to work for CBS News, first on the national assignment desk and then, as a producer on the CBS Morning Show with Diane Sawyer and Bill Kurtis. In 1986, he produced the CBS specials AIDS Hits Home and 48 Hours on Crack Street. He became a foreign reporter who travelled to more than 70 countries, and was responsible for war reportage from nations such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Bosnia. He was stationed in London for 12 years, throughout the 1990s, from where he reported on events in the Soviet Union and, later, Russia.

In July 2010, when he was serving his sentence at Rikers Island, Halderman was nominated for an Emmy as a producer of a 48 Hours Mystery segment regarding Amanda Knox.

The new venture was financed by the issue of 40,000 preference shares at £1 each.The Times, 13 July 1921, p. 20 Among the musicians who met at the inaugural meeting of the new enterprise at the Queen's Hall were Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Sir Charles Stanford, Harry Plunket Greene, Walter Hyde, Aylmer Buesst and Sir Henry Hadow.

She gave her services free of charge, to support the company. She did not, however, feel equal to relearning her old roles in English translation, and she sang in Italian while the rest of the company sang in the vernacular.The Times, 4 January 1923, p. 10 The British National Opera Company was a pioneer of broadcast opera, with excerpts from The Magic Flute broadcast live from the Royal Opera House by the British Broadcasting Company in January 1923, less than a year after the foundation of both the BBC and the opera company.See The Times, 9 January 1923, p. 8 and The Manchester Guardian, 10 January 1923, p. 10. However, Harold Rosenthal in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera states that the BNOC gave \\"the first broadcast in Europe of a complete opera\\" from \\"the company's matinée performance of Hänsel und Gretel at Covent Garden on 6 January 1923\\", but this conflicts not only with the Times and Guardian reports, but with the BBC's schedules: daily broadcasts did not begin until 5.00 p.m, too late for a relay of a matinée. The company's first artistic director was Percy Pitt, who had been music director with the Grand Opera Syndicate and who later worked as Director of Music for the BBC. His successor in 1924 was baritone Frederic Austin, who in 1920 arranged the music for a revival of The Beggar's Opera at the Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith). The Company had a wide repertory, which included works by Wagner, Debussy, Italian opera and several English works, including Vaughan Williams's Hugh the Drover and Gustav Holst's The Perfect Fool and At the Boar's Head. The New Grove Dictionary of Opera singled out the company's staging of the Ring, Tristan und Isolde, Parsifal and \\"a notable production in English of Pelléas and Mélisande with Maggie Teyte.\\" British National Opera Company employed most of the leading British and British-based singers and conductors of that time, including conductors John Barbirolli, Adrian Boult, Aylmer Buesst, Hamilton Harty, Gervase Hughes and Malcolm Sargent, and singers Agnes Nicholls, Florence Austral, Joseph Hislop, Edward Johnson, Dinh Gilly, Walter Hyde, Harold Williams, Norman Allin, Robert Radford, Dora Labbette, Walter Widdop, Frank Mullings, Herbert Heyner and Heddle Nash, among others.

Its last performances were Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci at the Golders Green Hippodrome in London, on 16 April 1929, in a season in which the conductors included Beecham, Barbirolli and Eugène Goossens.

Ludvig Vilhelm August Douglas, Count of Mühlhausen, Gondelsheim, Skenninge and Stjernorp, Lord of Langenstein and Stjernorp castles (24 November 1849 - 20 July 1916), was a conservative Swedish politician and official. He was a direct patrilineal descendant of Field Marshal Robert Douglas. Ludvig Douglas was born at Zürich, Switzerland. His parents were Count Carl Israel Douglas (1824-1898), first count of the Douglas family in the nobility of Baden (since 1848) as Count of Mühlhausen, and his wife Countess Louise von Gondelsheim and Langenstein (1825-1900), herself a daughter of the morganatic marriage of Louis I, Grand Duke of Baden and Katharina Werner. Through his mother, he was a second cousin of Victoria of Baden, wife of King Gustaf V of Sweden. He received the fideicommiss of Muhlhausen and the castle of Langenstein as his share of the family inheritance and reclaimed in c1875 his ancestral castle of Stjernorp in Sweden, which had been lost to his family after a fire in 1789. He ultimately succeeded his childless elder brother as head of the comital House of Douglas. Douglas was a protectionist and solidly oriented towards Germany. From 1895 to 1899, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden. He resigned because he refused to accept that Norway (then in union with Sweden) would have their flag without the mark of the union, i.e. he opposed the so-called pure flag. He also held the position of Riksmarskalk (Marshal of the Realm) (1911-1916), Landshövding (governor) of Uppsala County (1893-1895), and Landshövding (governor) of Östergötland County (1901-1912). Douglas worked for the Norrlander farmers' party against the forest products companies, they demanded protective legislation in field of wood market. Count Ludvig died at Lysekil, and is buried at the Douglas family graveyard in Vreta monastic church, Sweden. His wife was Countess Anna Louise Ehrensvärd, daughter of Count Albert Ehrensvärd the Elder, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden (1885-1889), and sister of Count Albert Ehrensvärd the Younger, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden (1911-1914). The Swedish branch of the Counts Douglas, to which Ludvig belonged, was the main surviving lineage of the family until Ludvig's sons and grandsons created several new branches (which spread over both Sweden and Germany. Lines descended from Ludvig Douglas include: * Counts von Douglas- Langenstein, descendants of Robert, eldest son of Ludvig. They still hold Langenstein Castle in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Robert's second (and childless) wife was Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern, dowager queen of Portugal. ** Counts Douglas, Barons von Reischach, descendants of a grandson of Robert von Douglas-Langenstein ** Counts Douglas-Gerstorp, the branch (settled in Sweden) descending from the youngest son of Robert von Douglas- Langenstein * Counts Douglas-Stjernorp, the branch descending from the Swedish general Archibald Douglas-Stjernorp, second son of Ludvig. This branch resides at Stjärnorp Castle and Rydboholm Castle. Archibald, through his eldest son, Carl Ludvig, is the grandfather of financier Count Gustaf Douglas and his sisters, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess in Bavaria and Rosita Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. * Counts Douglas-Kolfall, the branch descending from Oscar, the youngest son of Ludvig.

It was the second worst accident involving a Fokker F28 and third deadliest aviation accident in Turkey at that time. Background The aircraft operating Flight 345 was a Fokker F28-1000 Fellowship with manufacturer serial number 11058, and made its first flight in 1972.

Flight 345 took off from Izmir Cumaovası Airport at around 18:00 EET (20:00 UTC) for a 40-minute flight to Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport with 38 passengers and 4 crew members on board. Accident At 18:39, the aircraft touched down on the runway at Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport but an electrical power failure at the airport at that very moment forced the crew to initiate a missed approach. Twenty-two seconds after the lights went off, the emergency generator jumped in and restored the runway lights. The pilot elected to remain VFR under an altitude of . At 18:43, the crew asked for permission to land while positioning for another approach.

The crime On the evening of the crime, Gilliam was drinking and using drugs with Kelvin Drummond and his brother, Tony Drummond. The three men car-jacked Doerfler as she got out of her car in a parking lot, and when they found that she only had three dollars on her, they forced her to go to an ATM and withdraw cash. During the drive to the ATM, they changed their minds, and after pulling over in a secluded area, Gilliam shot Doerfler in the head with a sawed-off shotgun. Gilliam and both of the Drummond brothers were arrested three days later after they attempted to rob a convenience store. Police found the murder weapon in Gilliam's car, and after Kelvin Drummond named Gilliam as the shooter, Gilliam confessed. The trial Gilliam chose to have his case tried by a judge rather than a jury. Judge John Fader of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County found Gilliam guilty of first- degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and kidnapping. On October 31, 1989, Gilliam was sentenced to death for the murder of Christine Doerfler. Tony Drummond was convicted separately and received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, while Kelvin Drummond agreed to plead guilty and testify against Gilliam. In exchange for his testimony and guilty plea he received a sentence of life with the possibility of parole. The appeals Gilliam's initial direct appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals was rejected in 1990, and the US Supreme Court refused to hear Gilliam's case in 1991. Gilliam then filed a petition for post-conviction relief in Baltimore County Circuit Court. The court denied relief, and Gilliam's appeals to the Maryland Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court were refused in 1993 and 1994 respectively. After his attempt to file a second post-conviction petition in the state courts was rejected Gilliam made a petition for habeas corpus relief with the US District Court for the District of Maryland. In November 1996 the court ruled that Gilliam's death sentence should be vacated based on ineffective assistance of counsel, however the State filed a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, and in April 1997 the court reversed itself and denied Gilliam's habeas petition. Gilliam appealed the district court's decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's decision in January 1998. On October 5, 1998 the US Supreme Court refused to hear the case. That same day Judge Fader signed a death warrant which went into effect on November 16, 1998. Execution Gilliam was executed by lethal injection at the Maryland Penitentiary on November 16, 1998. He was pronounced dead at 10:27 PM. Gilliam's last hope had been a petition for clemency to Governor Parris Glendening, which was rejected the previous day. Two last- minute appeals to the US Supreme Court were also turned down. Gilliam did not apologize or express remorse in the death chamber, and his last words were \\"Allah, forgive them for what they do.\\" Like all inmates executed in Maryland, Gilliam was not given a special last meal. He was 32 years old. See also *Capital punishment in Maryland *Capital punishment in the United States ReferencesExternal links *Gilliam v.

The original Norwegian title, appelsin, refers specifically to the fruit and not the colour. Plot Overview Georg Røed's father Jan Olav died when he was four years old. Eleven years later, Georg's grandmother finds letters addressed to Georg from Jan Olav, written before his death, along with a story titled \\"The Orange Girl.\\" As Georg soon discovers, \\"The Orange Girl\\" is not simply a story, but a riddle from the past that centres around an incident from his father's youth. In the story, it is revealed that Jan Olav had once boarded a tram and had taken notice of a beautiful girl who had been clutching a bag of oranges. When tram abruptly jolted, the girl's oranges were dispersed. Jan Olav attempted to collect the oranges, but found that the girl had already disembarked from the tram. The story is a request for his son to solve the mystery of the orange girl's identity. Georg realizes that the \\"orange girl\\" was his mother, whom he is still living with. The story turns out to be his father telling him how he and his mother met, and then explains how horrible it was to find out he was dying. He ends the letter by asking Georg the question: if before you were born, you were given the choice to live and be very happy, but die young and have all of the happiness taken away, or to not live at all, what would you choose?

Early life and career Douglas was born on 19 July 1883 at Stjärnorp Castle, Östergötland County and was the second of three sons of Count Ludvig Douglas, Marshal of the Realm, and Countess Anna Louise Dorotea (née Ehrensvärd). His younger brother, Count Carl Douglas (1888–1946), was a chamberlain, and his elder brother Robert (1880–1955), a nobleman in Germany, married dowager Queen Augusta Victoria of Portugal, widow of King Manuel II. Archibald Douglas was cousin to general Carl August Ehrensvärd (his successor on the Chief of the Army post), vice admiral Gösta Ehrensvärd and Deputy Director of the Ministry of Defence Augustin Ehrensvärd. He became an officer in 1903 and was promoted to lieutenant in the Life Regiment Dragoons (K 2) in 1906. Douglas was lieutenant in the General Staff in 1913 and served as general staff officer in the staff of the 1st Army Division (I. arméfördelningen) from 1914 to 1917. He was promoted to captain in 1916 and did the same year a study trip to Galicia region in Central-Eastern Europe. Back in Sweden, Douglas served as a military history teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College in Stockholm from 1917 to 1918 and as general staff officer at the Finnish headquarters during the Finnish Civil War in 1918. During his time in Finland in 1918, he became captain and lieutenant colonel in the Finnish Army and took part in the Battle of Länkipohja and Battle of Tampere. Back in Sweden, Douglas became ryttmästare and squadron commander in the Life Regiment Dragoons in 1919 and taught ground warfare at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College on and off between 1919 and 1929. In 1922, Douglas returned to the General Staff as captain and became major there in 1924. He served as chief of staff of the 5th Army Division (V. arméfördelningen) from 1923 to 1927 when he became major in the Life Regiment Dragoons. Douglas became lieutenant colonel in the Life Regiment of Horse (Livregementet till häst, K 1) in 1928. He was promoted to colonel and appointed commanding officer of Norrland Dragoon Regiment (K 4) in 1930 and in 1935 Douglas was appointed executive officer of the Life Regiment of Horse. In 1937 Douglas was promoted to major general and appointed commanding officer of Upper Norrland's Troops (Övre Norrlands trupper) and in 1940 he conducted a study trip to Germany and France. In 1942 he was appointed Inspector of the Swedish Army and the year after he was chairman of the Officer Training Investigation (Officersutbildningsutredningen). In 1944, Douglas was promoted to lieutenant general and was appointed Chief of the Army. During this time he also served as president of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences from 1945 to 1947.

All that remains of the site is the ditch of the henge and a series of stone settings, none of which is visible above ground. Excavations The site was excavated in August 2008 and again in August 2009; it is considered to be an important find by archaeologists. Full details of the discovery were published in the 2010 January / February edition of British Archaeology.Newhenge, British Archaeology 110, January / February 2010, Mike Parker Pearson and his team of researchers played a key role in the discovery of this new henge site along the River Avon that links to Stonehenge. This new site was uncovered through excavation during the Stonehenge Riverside Project; it was given the name “Bluestonehenge” or “Bluehenge” because traces of bluestones were found during the excavation. The term “henge” is often incorrectly thought to mean a circular structure of stones. In fact, henge in archaeology refers to an enclosed structure made of compressed earth, containing a ditch on the inside of the bank, giving the perception of keeping something inside the enclosure, rather than keeping out others. Stonehenge may be improperly named, according to the original archeological definition, as its ditch is located on the outside of the bank.See Henge § Etymology Initial findings The monument has been tentatively dated to between about 3000 and 2400 BC. Radiocarbon dating of antler tools found at the site has provided only an approximate date of 2469 to 2286 BC for the dismantling of the stones. Tests on an antler pick found at the bottom of a stonehole have so far failed, due to inadequate collagen in the sample. Excavation revealed several stone settings that are thought to have been erected some time between 3400-2500 BC, due to two flint chisel arrowheads being found that are in a style commonly used during that period. It is estimated that there may have been as many as 27 stones in a circle in diameter. Charcoal was found in some holes, suggesting that burning may have taken place there. One suggestion is that the henge was a site for cremations. Within the stone circle there were imprints of the bases from the original stones, which have been compared to the bluestones located in Stonehenge and have been found to have matching dimensions. The name \\"Bluestonehenge\\" is derived from the discovery of small stone chips in some of the stone settings. These bluestones are also found in Stonehenge and consist of a wide range of rock types originally from Pembrokeshire, west Wales, some away. Archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suspects that any bluestones in the circle may have been removed around 2500 BC and incorporated into Stonehenge, which underwent major rebuilding work at about that time. The stone circle settings were surrounded by a henge, comprising an ditch and outer bank which appears to date from approximately 2400 BC. Unlike Stonehenge, this monument does not appear to have any significant solar or lunar orientations. Context The River Avon near the site of Bluestonehenge The henge is located beside the River Avon in West Amesbury. Immediately beside it is the Avenue, a linear ditch and bank route that leads to Stonehenge. Mike Parker Pearson has suggested that the site may have been used for ceremonial purposes – possibly as a stopping place along a routeway between Durrington Walls and Stonehenge. It is thought that it was a ceremonial route from an area of life at Durrington Walls, through Bluestonehenge and along the \\"Stonehenge Avenue\\", to arrive at the site of an individual's final resting place in Stonehenge. This theory can be supported by the numerous cremation burials (over 200) that have been uncovered during excavation work around Stonehenge. Analysis of these remains also leads researchers to believe it was a ceremony for the wealthier in the region, or of royal lineage, or even for those who helped initiate construction of Stonehenge. This select group of individuals was believed to be male adults who were 25–40 years old and who seemed quite healthy. Mike Parker Pearson’s past experience working with a colleague from Madagascar also helped to shape his theory. He believes that the choice of stone material for Stonehenge is significant. Past civilizations often reserved stone for construction of their ancestors’ tombs, while the perishable material, such as the wood used for the Durrington Walls timber circles, was reserved for the living. Parker Pearson believes that Durrington Walls may have been a \\"land of the living\\" while Stonehenge (which was Britain's largest known cemetery at the time) was a \\"domain of the dead\\".

The airfield had its probable origins as early as 1912, as an Aéronautique Militaire airfield, later being extensively used by the United States Army Air Service. It became a permanent airfield between the wars and during the Phony War with Nazi Germany (1939–1940) was the home of G.C. II/5 (The French Air Force descendant of the World War I Lafayette Escadrille) equipped with American Curtis Hawk 75A fighters. Seized in the Battle of France, it became a Luftwaffe airfield until being captured by the United States Third Army in September 1944. It then became a United States Army Air Forces combat airfield until the end of the war. After the war, the airfield was redeveloped into a private industrial estate. History=World War I Archives concerning the origins of the Toul- Croix de Metz airfield are rather scarce. Some documents show that the area was turned to the Army as soon as 1912, but the \\"Aero-Guide\\" of 1913 and the \\"Guide Michelin pour les Pilotes Militaires\\" of 1914 mention only two usable airfields around Toul: one at Dommartin, 1 mi. east of town - with a hangar for airships, and military grounds 1.5 mi. west of town. However, the airfield of Croix de Metz is heavily used by the Aéronautique Militaire as early as August 1914. Two barracks were built each side of the airfield at some time between 1912 and 1916: \\"Caserne Ferber\\" on the south side, and \\"Caserne Gengoult\\" on the north side, which was later used by the Americans forces, which explain why the Croix de Metz airfield was sometimes called Gengoult Aerodrome. Airships flown from Toul probably departed from Dommartin. In April 1918 it was turned over to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). When first deployed to France, the first few Aero Squadrons of the AEF were dispersed under various army commands, among other reasons to completed their training. When ready for action and numerous enough, to obtain coordination of aerial activities, some higher organization was required: the United States Army Air Service fighter and bomber Aero Squadrons were thus organized in one Bombardment Group and four Pursuit Groups, meanwhile the observation and reconnaissance Aero Squadrons joined Corps and Army Observation GroupsAmerican Aviators of World War I Known American units at Toul were:.

September 1918 * 69th Balloon Company, 1918-September 1918 As Croix de Metz was one of the most active American airfields, other air units might have been assigned to it during World War I, yet unidentified. The Americans at Toul flew reconnaissance sorties, protected observation aircraft, attacked enemy observation balloons, strafed enemy troops, flew counter-air patrols, and bombed towns, bridges, and railroad stations behind the enemy's lines. Some of the most illustrious names in early American Army aviation were assigned to Toul during World War I, including Eddie Rickenbacker; Quentin Roosevelt; Frank Luke; Carl Spaatz; Billy Mitchell and others. The Americans at Toul demobilized and left France after the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the last leaving in early 1919, as can be seen above. Between the wars The airfield first appears in the navigation charts in 1920 as a 400 x 900 m landing ground. In 1928, a part of it was assigned to the local \\"Aero-club Toulois\\", which seems to be the only permanent user. The airfield is expanded in 1936, probably at the same time 4 hangars are built, but still with no unit permanently stationed. When World War II broke out in September 1939, the \\"Groupe de Chasse II/5\\" was assigned to Toul-Croix De Metz; the Group's first \\"escadrille\\" aircraft sported a \\"Sioux Head\\", but it was not before 1942 that the escadron received the lineage of the Lafayette Escadrille, thus becoming \\"Groupe de Chasse II/5 Lafayette\\". The Group was equipped with (not so) obsolete Curtiss Hawk Model 75s. From surviving accounts of the squadron during the Battle of France the Hawk-equipped Group claimed 230 confirmed and 80 probable victories in H75s against only 29 aircraft lost in aerial combat.Lafayette Escadrille - Post WWI In addition to the French unis, Polish Air Force exiles flew Morane fighters with the \\"Groupe de Chasse III/1\\" from the airfield during the early spring weeks before the German offensive into France and the Low Countries. With the subsequent German Blitzkrieg and the breakout of the Wehrmacht at Sedan the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force was overwhelmed. The few units still on the field surrendered to the Germans along with the French Armed Forces at the Second Armistice at Compiègne on 22 June 1940. German use during World War II Shortly after its capture, the airfield was turned over to the Luftwaffe. The airfield was initially used primarily as a training base for ground support units. In September 1942, Zerstörerschule 2 (Fighter-Destroyer School 2) (ZS 2) used the base as a training facility for Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter pilots until February 1944.The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 Toul became an operational airfield in July 1944, when Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53) arrived at the airfield with Heinkel He 111 medium bombers. The He 111s were used as carrier aircraft for launching V-1 Flying Bombs, aimed at targets in Britain. kg 53 withdrew from the airfield at the end of August, ahead of the advancing American Third Army which was moving into the area. Toul-Croix De Metz was attacked by USAAF Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers to attempt to stop these V-1 attacks.USAFHRA Document 00221383 American use during World War II The IX Engineer Command moved the 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion to Toul airfield on 14 September 1944. The airfield was relatively intact, and began clearing the airport of mines; destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, it became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-90\\" Toul-Croix De Metz the next day.IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Under American control, Toul-Croix De Metz was initially used as a resupply and casualty evacuation (S&E;) airfield, with C-47 Skytrain transports using the airfield frequently, carrying in supplies and moving wounded personnel to hospitals in the rear.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. In October, the 862d EAB moved in and laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking all-weather runway. The engineers also repaired the barracks and other facilities at the base, allowing it to be used though the winter months. In November, the 358th Fighter Group moved in with P-47 Thunderbolts and flew operational missions from the base until the beginning of April 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . The airfield was closed, and returned to French control after the war on 30 October 1945. Postwar use In French control after the war, the airfield was closed and for years was left unused. The growing urban area of Toul and the need for other, more pressing reconstruction after the war led the Air Ministry to sell off the property to private interests, and not rebuild it as a military airfield. A major reason was that the airfield was physically small, and the cost to purchase additional land to build a jet runway, and other facilities was very high. In addition, the prospect of jet fighter aircraft taking off and landing over the urbanized area around the airfield was highly undesirable. In 1950 when NATO was looking to locate an American Air Force fighter airfield in the area, given the historical American association with Toul, the World War II airfield at Rosieres En Haye was made available.McAuliffe, Jerome J: U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967 (2005), Chapter 16, Toul-Rosieres Air Base. United States Army use In 1951, the abandoned airfield was turned over by the French to the United States Army for use as an Engineering Depot. Army units were assigned to the field to clear the remnants of the World War II Army Airfield and completely re-design the facility. Railroad spurs, new hard-surfaced roads, permanent buildings, warehouses and utilities were put in, and in December 1952 the facility was re-opened as the Toul Engineer Depot. Initially used as a reserve depot for supplies and equipment, but in 1955 the facility was upgraded to become a major depot supporting USAREUR units in both France and Germany. This was scaled back in 1956 due to budget reductions to support Army Engineering units in France only. Further budget cuts in 1960 led to its consolidation with the Army's Nancy General Depot, and in November 1961 the facility was closed and returned to French military control. Current use The French government sold the land and all of the buildings to private interests during the 1960s. Today in aerial photography, clear outlines of former buildings can be seen in grassy areas, as well as the runways and taxiways of the former airfield, the streets put in by the United States Army. It is now an industrial estate.

His mother is Danish, and Thompson grew up speaking the language, a skill which aided his later career as a translator of European comic books. (He was also fluent in French.) Thompson developed an interest in comics early in life, some of his favorites being the works of André Franquin, Maurice Tillieux, and Jacques Tardi. As a young man, Thompson was a frequent contributor to American superhero comic book letter columns, with letters published in (among others) Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, Conan the Barbarian, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Marvel Spotlight, and Marvel-Two-in-One.Smith, Stephen Scott Beau. \\"The LOCsmiths,\\" Amazing Heroes #23 (May 15, 1983).

Thompson was a regular contributor to the industry magazine The Comics Journal (which is published by Fantagraphics) since 1977. Although soft-spoken in person, as a writer Thompson did not shy from controversy. Even though he personally reviewed Dave Sim's long-running self-published comic Cerebus in early issues of The Comics Journal, Thompson (along with Groth) later took Sim to task in its pages for Sim's controversial statements about feminism and self- publishing.The Comics Journal #174 (February 1995). Thompson was also a regular contributor to the (now defunct) Fantagraphics-published magazine Amazing Heroes, writing for that journal from 1981–1987. Since Fantagraphics began publishing comics in 1982, Thompson edited many of the company's most popular titles, including Peter Bagge's Hate, Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Library, Joe Sacco's Palestine, Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo, Linda Medley's Castle Waiting, and anthologies like Critters and Zero Zero. Thompson's last major Fantagraphics release was a remastered and expanded new edition of Guy Peellaert's landmark graphic novel The Adventures of Jodelle (1966) for which Thompson also provided a new translation from the French. = Translator = A long-time champion of European comics, Thompson translated the work of a number of international cartoonists published by Fantagraphics, as well as material used in The Comics Journal. He was also the regular translator of the Ignatz Series co-published by Fantagraphics.

In 421 BCE the Athenians settled at Cranii helot deserters of Sparta and the Messenians who were withdrawn from Pylos on the surrender of that fortress to the Lacedaemonians. As part of the negotiations with Sparta after the \\"50 Years Truce\\" was signed, these people were moved from their garrison at Pylos where they were involved in a blockade of the troops on the island in the bay of Pylos. They were relieved by Athenian troops who then garrisoned the bay. Cranii surrendered to the Romans without resistance in 189 BCE. It is mentioned both by Strabo and Pliny the Elder.

According to Thucydides, the earliest recorded naval battle took place between Korkyra and Corinth, roughly 260 years before he was writingThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.13. -- and thus in the middle of the seventh century BC. He also writes that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers in fifth century BC Greece, along with Athens and Corinth.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.36.3 Epirus in antiquity The antagonism between Korkyra and its mother city Corinth appears to have been an old one. Quite apart from the naval battle Thucydides talks of, Herodotus records a myth involving the tyrant of Corinth, Periander. Periander was estranged from his younger son, Lycophron, who believed that his father had killed his mother Milissa. After failing to reconcile with Lycophron, he sent him to Korkyra, then within Corinth's governance. In his old age, Periander sent for his son to come and rule over Corinth, suggesting that they would trade places and he would rule Korkyra while his son came to rule Corinth. To prevent this, the Korkyraeans killed Lycophron. In punishment, Periander captured 300 young men of Korkyra with the intention of castrating them.Herodotus, The Histories 3.48-52. This is more likely to be a myth explaining the animosity between Corinth and Korkyra (and justifying the use of the word tyrant for Periander's rule) than an actual historical event.Osborne, R. 1996. Greece in the Making 1200-479BC. Routledge. A relief of Dionysus Bacchus at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu. Pediment with Dionysos at the Corfu Museum. Left part of an Archaic pediment from the area of Figareto. It depicts a Dionysiac symposium. Dated to 500 B.C. The Persian War In the Persian War of 480 BC, Greek envoys were sent to Korkyra requesting aid. Korkyra enthusiastically promised ships, and fitted out sixty of them, but they failed to arrive in time for the battle of Salamis. Herodotus ascribes this to a desire among the Korkyraeans to remain neutral and thus not support the losing side. The excuse given for failing to join the battle was unfavourable winds, whereas Herodotus says that, had the Persians been victorious, the Korkyraeans would have claimed to have deliberately avoided the battle, thereby to gain favour from the invading Persians.Herodotus, The Histories 7.168. The Peloponnesian War Writing between 431 and 411 BC, Thucydides credited Korkyra's conflict with Corinth over their joint city Epidamnus as a significant cause of the Peloponnesian War. Korkyra, otherwise neutral as far as the two major powers, the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League, were concerned, appealed to Athens, head of the Delian League, for assistance against Corinth, who belonged to the Peloponnesian League.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.24-45. In 427 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, there was a civil war in Korkyra between the democrats, who wished to remain in an alliance with Athens, and the aristocrats, who claimed that they were being enslaved to Athens and wished to form an alliance with Corinth. The democrats won with help from Athenian ships, and subsequently slaughtered anyone they suspected of being an enemy.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 3.69-85. The Fourth Century BC Around 375 BC, a Peloponnesian fleet, under the command of Mnesippus, attacked Korkyra. Following the siege, the resident Korkyraeans, suffering from hunger, deserted, were sold as slaves or, later, put to death by Mnesippus.Xenophon, A History of My Times 6.2.4-23. The Hellenistic Era In the Hellenistic Period Korkyra changed hands several times. In 303 BC, after a vain siege by Cassander of Macedon, the island was occupied for a short time by the Lacedaemonian general Cleonymus of Sparta, then regained its independence. Three years on Cassander besieged it again, but his fleet was destroyed by an intervention of Agathocles of Syracuse. The tyrant of Syracuse added the island to his own domains, and in 295 BC he offered it as dowry to his daughter Lanassa on her marriage to Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. When Lanassa left Pyrrhus in 291 BC she tried to transfer Korkyra to her next husband, king Demetrius Poliorcetes of Macedon, but in 274 BC Pyrrhus' son Ptolemy recovered Korkyra for his father.Justin, 25, 4, 8.Guide to Greece 1.11.6. Korkyra remained a member of the Epirote League until 255 BC, when it regained independence after the death of Alexander II, last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following a Greek defeat in the naval battle of Paxos, the city suffered a short-lived occupation by Illyrians under the command of Demetrius of Pharos. Polybius wrote the background of this incident, in that same year \\"When the season for sailing had come, [Queen] Teuta sent out a larger fleet of [piratical] galleys than ever against the Greek shores, some of which sailed straight for Corcyra....\\" Another part of the fleet which had sailed for Epidamnius being repulsed went also \\"there, to the terror of the inhabitants, they disembarked and set about besieging the town...the Corcyreans...sent off envoys to the Achaean and Aetolian leagues, begging for instant help...ten decked ships of war belonging to the Achaeans were manned...fitted out in a few days, set sail for Corcyra in hopes of raising the siege.\\" However, \\"the Illyrians obtained a reinforcement of seven decked ships from the Acarnanians\\" engaging off the island of Paxi. They bested the Achaeans, capturing four ships and sinking one; the remaining five ran back home. \\"The Illyrians, on the other hand, filled with self-confidence by their success, continued their siege of [Corcyra] in high spirits...while the Corcyreans, reduced to the despair of their safety by what had happened, after sustaining the siege for a short time longer, made terms with the Illyrians, consenting to receive a garrison, and with it Demetrius of Pharos.\\" The Roman Republic intervened almost immediately, sending one of the consuls to relieve the island. At the end of the First Illyrian War Korkyra was declared a free city and transformed into a Roman protectorate, de facto ending the independence of the polis. Around 189 BC it was governed by a Roman prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), and in 148 BC it was attached to the province of Macedonia.The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.

The Pellendones (also known as Pelendones CeltiberorumPliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, III, 26. or CerindonesLivy, Fragmenta Librii, 91.) were an ancient pre-Roman people living on the Iberian Peninsula. From the early 4th century BC they inhabited the region near the source of the river DueroPliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, III, 26. in what today is north-central Spain. The area comprises the north of Soria, the southeast of Burgos and the southwest of La Rioja provinces. Origins Possibly of mixed Illyrian and Celtic origin, the Pellendones migrated to the Iberian Peninsula around the 4th Century BC.Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, III, 29.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 4, 12. Their original native name might have been *KellendonesCurchin, The Romanization of Central Spain, p. 37. and it is believed that they were related to the Gallic Belendi or Pelendi of the middle Sigmatis (today's Leyre) river valley (approximately today's Belin-Béliet territory) in Gallia (Gaul). Albertos, Mª L. (1976), “La antroponimia prerromana de la Península Ibérica” They spoke a 'Q-Celtic' language. Culture A predominantly stock-raising people that practiced transhumance in the grazing lowlands of the Ebro valley, they had their capital at Visontium (Vinuesa – Soria), and are credited as being the original founders of Numantia (Muela de Garray – Soria)Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, III, 26. and Savia (Soria?). They also controlled the towns of Aregrada (Ágreda? – Sória; Celtiberian mints: Areicoraticos/Arecorataz), Arenetum (Arnedo, near Inestrillas – La Rioja), Quelia/Quelium (Quel, near Arnedo – La Rioja; Celtiberian mint: Cueliocos) and Contrebia Leukade (Aguillar del Rio Alhama – La Rioja), although the location of Viscintium, Lutia (Cantalucia?), Olibia and Varia remains either incertain or unknown. History Closely related with both the Arevaci – to whom they were a dependant tribe, though regarded as a separated peopleLivy, Fragment 18. – and the Vettones, they threw off the Arevacian yoke possibly with Roman help in the late 2nd century BC, receiving the town of Numantia and respective lands when the Romans partitioned the territory of the defeated Arevaci amongst their neighbours.Appian, Iberiké, 99. However, during the Sertorian Wars, they sided with Quintus Sertorius and provided unspecified troops to his army.Livy, Fragmenta Librii, 91. In the late 1st Century BC, the Pellendones were aggregated to the new Hispania Terraconensis province created by Emperor Augustus, who founded the Roman colony of Augustobriga (Muro de Ágreda) in their territory.

It is also celebrated as Barbaroba (ბარბარობა) among Christians in Georgia. Barbaroba Retrieved 1 October 2019 Its celebration shares many elements with Halloween, though coming from a much earlier tradition, and unrelated to the feast of the dead. Traditionally, adults and children wearing disguise go around houses in the villages dancing and singing the story of Saint Barbara; and in each house, they are offered food specially prepared for that feast (and sometimes money). Eid il-Burbara Retrieved 1 August 2013 It is celebrated in honour of the Christian Saint and Martyr Saint Barbara. The general belief among Lebanese Christians is that Saint Barbara disguised herself as many different characters to elude the Romans who were persecuting her. Traditions The traditional food made on this feast is Burbara, a bowl of boiled wheat grains, pomegranate seeds, raisins, anise and sugar. It is offered to children who go from one house to another in costumes. Saint Barbara Traditions and Customs Retrieved 1 August 2013 In the Middle East, Middle Eastern Christians cook a dough that is filled with walnuts or cheese. Heavy traffic occurs in bakeries because of people buying the traditional food for this holiday. Children go trick or treating St. Barbara's Day Retrieved 1 August 2013 while singing a special song for Eid il-Burbara. A common practice in Lebanon on Eid il-Burbara finds its source in the story of Saint Barbara who, it was believed was miraculously saved from persecution while fleeing: She ran through freshly planted wheat fields, which grew instantly to cover her path. This miracle is celebrated symbolically by planting wheat seeds (or chick peas, barley grains, beans, lentils, etc.) in cotton wool on Saint Barbara’s feast day. The seeds germinate and grow up to around 6 inches in time for Christmas, when the shoots are used to decorate the nativity scene usually placed below the Christmas tree.

Chicago Outfit career  In 2002, the Chicago Sun-Times called Fratto a \\"reputed Elmwood Park street lieutenant.\\" His name had come up during a sentencing hearing for a former Chicago police Chief of Detectives, in which Fratto was shown on FBI surveillance tapes to have held meetings with the former Chief of Detectives. In 2005, Fratto was identified in the Chicago Sun-Times as having met with Michael \\"Mickey\\" Marcello, the half-brother of reputed mob boss James Marcello, to approve efforts by the Marcellos to take over the video poker in several Chicago suburbs, including Cicero and Berwyn. Later that year, Fratto was reported to have been one of five mob bosses who invited Chicago Outfit Consigliere Marco D'Amico's son-in-law Jacques Darrow Carr to a meeting at an Elmwood Park, Illinois restaurant with the mayor of Rosemont, Illinois because they were clients of Carr's legal document assistance firm J.D.C. Legal Document Assistants at Law. Carr is a Los Angeles legal profession L.D.A. and protege of now deceased mob attorney Sidney Korshak. At that meeting they discussed how the Chicago Outfit would control contracts at a casino in Rosemont, according to testimony by FBI agent John Mallul. The other bosses at the meeting were Joseph Lombardo, Joseph Andriacchi, John DiFronzo and Peter DiFronzo.  Recent indictments and convictions  In September 2009, Fratto was indicted on tax evasion charges for allegedly not having reported nearly $200,000 in income in 2005. Also in 2009, Fratto and John DiFronzo were alleged in a civil lawsuit by Joseph Fosco, the son of late Teamsters treasurer Armando Fosco, to have tried to extort $400,000 from Fosco.http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/09/reputed-mobster-fratto- charged-in-new-federal-case.html Fratto subsequently was convicted for evading federal income tax payments for seven years.
