The Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority decides on permits, fees and registration for terrestrial television, community and commercial radio; and monitor radio and television programme services, on-demand services and teletext, to verify that the content of radio and television programmes adhere to broadcasting regulations. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission, a decision-making body within the authority, investigate if the content adheres to regulations, after complaints lodged by viewers and listeners, or at the initiative of the Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority. Additional tasks include verifying that cable companies and IPTV providers retransmit SVT, and that the broadcasting companies are licensed and managed in accordance with Swedish legislation. The agency was established in 2010 after the Swedish Radio and TV Authority () merged with the Swedish Broadcasting Commission (), in conjunction with an amendment to the Radio and Television Act (SFS 2010:696). Swedish Broadcasting Commission The Swedish Broadcasting Commission (, GRN) was a Swedish government agency formed in 1994 to regulate already broadcast radio and television in Sweden. Since 2010, the commission is part of the Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority. =Jurisdiction= The Commission's primary function is to ensure that radio and television channels broadcasting in and from Sweden under licences issued by the government or the Swedish Radio and TV Authority observe the rules laid down in the Swedish Radio and Television Act. It has the power to impose fines on broadcasters it judges to have broken those rules. A number of channels broadcasting primarily to Sweden do not actually broadcast from Sweden itself. This is principally to allow these channels to circumvent the strict regulation of broadcast advertising in Sweden (advertising breaks were illegal until 2002). The main channels targeting Sweden, but not broadcasting from there, are TV3 and Kanal 5, both of which are broadcast from London in the UK. The GRN has repeatedly ruled that TV3 and Kanal 5, since they do not broadcast from Sweden, do not have to adhere to Swedish broadcasting regulations but are subject to the control of the British broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Other Swedish channels broadcasting from the UK are ZTV, TV6, and The Voice TV. Representatives of commercial broadcaster TV4 have several times criticized both the Commission and the foreign channels and argued for abolition of the GRN, letting the Swedish Press Council Pressens Opinionsnämnd take over its functions. Starting with TV4 Fakta in 2005, TV4 has decided to broadcast its new channels from Finland. In practice, therefore, the GRN supervises only broadcasts from Sweden - including TV4 and its sister channels TV4 Plus and TV400. With the digital franchise renewal of 2006, however, the licence terms were changed so that TV4's digital-only channels would no longer be subject to the same terms as those applying to its analogue licence. =Cases= The Commission has on several occasions found Ring P1, a call-in show on the public talk radio channel P1, to have been in breach of the requirements of Sveriges Radio (SR)'s broadcasting licence. In December 2004, for example, the GRN ruled that the programme had broken the terms of the licence when its presenter declared: \\"the fact that I'm a republican, have always been a republican, and always will be a republican isn't something I can do anything about\\". This statement was considered biased, since SR (like SVT, TV4, and UR) are required by their licences to maintain impartiality. In 2004, GRN ruled that it was not clear that The Man Show, broadcast on TV4 Plus, was clearly satirical in intent. Since then TV4 AB has shown a disclaimer whenever it has broadcast the show. When shown on the youth channel TV400, this was replaced with a satirical film containing photographs of the members of the GRN. The Oprah Winfrey Show was fined several times for improper support (mostly concerning \\"Oprah's favorite things\\") and had to be moved from TV4 to TV3.

He was elected member of the Urban Council of Hong Kong from 1967 to 1986 and Hong Kong member to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1986 to 1998. Early life Dr. Huang was born in Shanghai on 24 July 1920. He travelled around China when he was young and spoke different dialects such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Sichuanese and Hunanese. He obtained his Doctor of Medicine from the West China Union College in Chengdu, Sichuan and the State University of New York in 1945. After he returned to China, he assisted Dr. Li Yan'an to establish the Ministry of Health in 1945 when he worked and taught at the Guangzhou Central Hospital. He moved to Hong Kong in 1948 before the Chinese Communists took over the mainland. Public career Dr. Huang worked for the medical department in the Hong Kong Government for about nine years from 1948 to 1954. At the time when tuberculosis was striking in Hong Kong, he was sent to the United Kingdom to study Tuberculosis Disease Diploma at the University of Wales which funded by the Sino-British Fellowship Trust. When he was in London, Dr. Huang represented the Hong Kong Government in the British Commonwealth Health and Tuberculosis Conference. He studied tuberculosis at the University of Edinburgh until he returned to Hong Kong in 1956. He resigned from the government and started his private practice. Dr. Huang was the President of the Chinese Christian Universities Alumni Association and also Yale Club of Hong Kong and became a council member of the Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He was also council member of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association, member of the Medical Council of Hong Kong and medical advisor to the Hong Kong Teachers' Association. He was also member of the Board of Governors and the General Committee of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Society. With the nominations by the education and church leaders, Dr. Huang ran for the Urban Council in the 1967 election. At the time, the Urban Council elections were dominated by the Reform Club and Civic Association, he was able to be elected as an Independent with the second highest votes just after Elsie Elliott, a leading social activist at the time who fought for many issues in the Urban Council with him in the following years. Urban Councillor =Constitutional reforms= Dr. Huang was an open critic of the colonial rule and government's policies during his service in the Urban Council. He had demanded the government to open elected seats in the Executive and Legislative Councils and expand the power of the Urban Council. In 1968, Elsie Elliott, Hilton Cheong-Leen and Dr. Huang threatened to resign from the Urban Council as a protest to the limited power of the Council. On 4 June 1969, Urban Councillors Elsie Elliott, Henry Hu and Dr. Denny Huang jointly sent a letter to British newspapers in the United Kingdom, requesting a \\"wholly local, internal, self-governing administration\\" and stating that China would \\"surely tolerate a more sophisticated, egalitarian and enlightened ordering of that society devoted to the interests of the overwhelming Chinese majority of their own compatriots.\\" In 1976 when Governor Murray MacLehose appointed eight new Unofficial Members to the Legislative Council, including Henry Hu from the Urban Council. Dr. Huang criticised the system as \\"backward\\". He argued that the unofficial members had all been members from the vested interests. Although many of the new appointed members were from different sectors but he doubted that their views would be valued as much as the members of the vested interests. Even for Henry Hu who was an elected Urban Councillor, he was hand-picked by the Governor but not elected among other Urban Councillors, which Huang and other elected Councillors had demanded for years. He denounced the government of using opposition from the Beijing regime as an excuse to refuse creating elected seats. In fact, the government was using the Beijing's unchanged policies towards Hong Kong to reinforce the colonial rule. After the District Boards were created in 1982, Dr. Huang also criticised the limited power and budget of the Boards. As an ex-officio member of the Yau Ma Tei District Board, He claimed that the District Boards were merely advisory bodies. Dr. Huang suggested Hong Kong should adopt the model of the Greater London Council, by putting District Boards directly under the Urban Council which the District Boards would have the power to execute the responsibilities of the Urban Council with a larger budget. =Social policies= As a medical practitioner in profession, Dr. Huang frequently commented on government's health services and policies. He suggested founding a medical school at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in response to the shortage of doctors in Hong Kong. He also urged the government to set up a licentiate examination for the Non-Commonwealth trained medical practitioners. Dr. Huang was the leading figure of the Chinese Language Movements in the 1960s and 70s. He was critical of the discriminatory language policy as English was the only official language in the colony but was not understood by majority of the Hong Kong Chinese residents. When he was the President of the Society for the Promotion of Chinese Education and Chairman of the All Hong Kong Working Party to promote Chinese as an Official Language, Dr. Huang took 330,000 signatures to No. 10 Downing Street for the recognition of Chinese as an official language in 1971. His demand was finally adopted by the government in 1974. Together with civil organisations such as the Hong Kong Federation of Students, the Hong Kong Chinese Education Promotion Committee co-founded the Joint Committee for Chinese Language Movement in November 1978 to lead the second wave of Chinese Language Movement which aimed at a higher social status for Chinese language and Chinese as medium of instruction at school. Dr. Huang urged for mother-tongue teaching in school, Chinese translations of the Hong Kong laws and the training of the Chinese- English translators. Between 1971 and 1976, Dr. Huang was also the Chairman of the Environment Hygiene Select Committee and also Keep Hong Kong Clean Campaign Committee, which was launched in 1972 with the aim to generate public concern of environmental cleanliness as the basis of civic pride. However, he resigned from the campaign in 1976, citing increasing government reluctance to provide financial support as it was government's fiscal philosophy of maintaining a small government. When the Hong Kong Housing Authority was established in 1972, the power of public housing managements was transferred to the new body. Dr. Huang became the Chairman of the Operations Committee of the Housing Authority. During his office in the Urban Council, he had proposed some very progressive ideas. He called for legalising prostitution by setting up a red light district miles away from the urban area, which was seen as radical in the conservative society in the 1960s. He believed that by regulating prostitution, it could prevent women in young age entering the industry, fight against the triad activities and also better control the sexually transmitted diseases. He also called for further promotion of sex education to prevent sexual violence, sexually transmitted diseases and contribute to eugenics and healthy marriage life. Furthermore, Dr. Huang agreed legalisation of abortion and homosexuality. In January 1980, a young Scottish Inspector with the Royal Hong Kong Police, John MacLennan, was found shot dead in his police dormitory before he was arrested on charges of homosexual behaviour which raised debates on decriminalisation of homosexuality. Although society was largely opposed to decriminalisation, Dr. Huang stated that if homosexual behaviours should not be criminal if the both parties were consent. Legalising homosexuality would prevent blackmailing, although he believed that homosexuality should not be encouraged. Dr. Huang was a strong advocate for capital punishment in Hong Kong. After death penalty was suspended in the United Kingdom in 1965, he suggested the Hong Kong Government not to follow the United Kingdom and carried out penalty in Hong Kong for deterrent effect. Homosexuality and capital punishment were not decriminalised and abolished until 1991 and 1993 respectively when the Hong Kong Government aimed at raising awareness of human rights when 1997 was approaching. On 30 January 1977, Dr. Huang organised a public assembly at the Victoria Park against the increase of rates. Thousands of people showed up on that day. Dr. Huang demanded cancellation of the unreasonable valuations in 1976 and re-evaluations of the properties. Eventually, Financial Secretary C. P. Haddon-Cave made concessions by setting the limits on the rates increase in his budget in March. =1967 Leftist riots= During the Leftist riots of 1967, Dr. Huang supported the government to maintain law and order stating that the riots were purely political and threatened the welfare of the Hong Kong residents and labours. However, he expressed his worries to the death penalty sentence to the bombers as suggested by Kan Yuet-keung, unofficial member of the Executive and Legislative Councils. Dr. Huang expressed that there were many rioters who planted bombs on the streets were only children who might have been used to do such acts. He was also opposed to Hilton Cheong-Leen's suggestion to publicly hang the convicted rioters. =1977 ICAC amnesty= In 1977, the investigations of the newly established Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into Royal Hong Kong Police provoked discontent within the Police Force. On 28 October 1977, a group of about 40 police officers stormed into the ICAC Operations Department Headquarters in Hutchison House. On 5 November 1977, Governor Murray MacLehose announced a partial amnesty for the offences committed before 1 January 1977. Dr. Denny Huang expressed his disappointment to the Governor's amnesty, stating that although an amnesty was inevitable, the government had undermined governance authority as it was forced to announce the amnesty so hastily under pressure. After the amnesty, the Attorney General John Hobley kept dropping charges against the suspects might also damage the judiciary system. He stated that the ICAC had lost the trust of the people after the incident and urged to chase after the corrupted high officials to clear the ICAC's bad images of evasion and racial prejudice. =Running for chairman and retirement= In 1981, Dr. Huang contested the Chairmanship of the Urban Council against Hilton Cheong-Leen after the former chairman A. de O. Sales decided not to run for re-election. Dr. Huang failed to win the seat with 7 to 14 votes. After almost 20 years in the Urban Council, Dr. Huang decided not to seek for re-election in the coming Urban Council election in 1986, stating that he was disappointed to the limited power of the Urban Council. He complained that the district- based constituencies which replaced the single territory-wide constituency in the 1983 Urban Council election produced \\"small councillors\\" who only cared about their own districts but the interest of whole Hong Kong. For his longtime services, he was made Justice of the Peace in 1982 and the Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1986. Transfer of sovereignty Huang was one of the earliest leaders in Hong Kong to support the Government of the People's Republic of China to resume the Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong after 1997. Before the PRC and UK governments began the negotiation over Hong Kong, Huang flew to Beijing to meet with Liao Chengzhi, the then director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office at the People's Great Hall on 25 October 1981. He was informed by Liao that the Beijing government would resume its sovereignty on Hong Kong as well as the power of administration. Liao also told Huang that the Beijing government would assist Hong Kong to maintain its development, prosperity and stability. In November 1982 when Huang met with Liao again in Beijing, he proposed making Hong Kong a \\"free city\\" with high autonomy for a period of forty years. Furthermore, he proposed the suggestions for the future of Hong Kong including the current laws and industrial and commercial regulations remained unchanged; full elected Executive, Legislative and Urban Councils and District Boards; Chinese Army would not station in Hong Kong and maintain order with only police force; Beijing would not interfere into Hong Kong internal affairs except for defence and diplomacy; Hong Kong legal system remained unchanged and Supreme Court of Hong Kong remained the highest court in the territory; banknotes continued to be issued by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank; considered leasing the Tamar site to the Royal Navy for supplies and repairs. In the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in December 1984, many of Dr. Huang's ideas were put into it. On 27 September 1983 when he met with Ji Pengfei, Liao's successor as the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Huang proposed a constitution for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to build confidence of the Hong Kong people and asked for its guarantee of the residents who disagreed with socialism could still have the right to stay, work and the manage Hong Kong affairs. Huang believed that the upholding of rule of law would ease the anxiety of the Hong Kong people. By that he urged the Hong Kong Government to raise the democratic consciousness and increase elected seats in the government. Huang was subsequently co-opted by Beijing to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a Hong Kong member in March 1986 and served until 1998. Death and family He died on 1 August 2007. He married Esther So-chang Liu with 5 children and had lived at No. 24 Somerset Road, Kowloon Tong.

The company was established in 2012 by serial entrepreneur Albert \\"Al\\" Goldstein, John Sun, and Paul Zhang. Initially structured as a mid-prime lender, the company issued its first personal unsecured loan in early 2013 using its proprietary technology to determine an individual's creditworthiness. History Avant Credit launched in late 2012 and offers consumers personal loans ranging from $2,000 to $35,000 with loan terms from 2 to 5 years. The Avant has a transparent model with APR ranging from 9.95-36%. The company issues the Avant Mastercard credit card in partnership with WebBank (U.S.). Avant's technology applies algorithms, machine-learning protocols, and analytical tools in addition to the standard consumer data pulled to determine a customized rate, amount and length at which money can be borrowed. The company began providing access to loans in just 16 states in 2013. Avant currently issues loans in 46 states, and in October 2013, the company expanded beyond US borders to Canada http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marketplace-lending-platform-avant- reaches-300000-customers-and-continues-global-expansion-with-canada- launch-300145021.html and the United Kingdom. From 2012 to 2015 the company saw substantial growth with over $1 billion in loans originated through Avant's website and $1.4 billion in contributions by investors, including August Capital, Tiger Global and Victory Park Capital. Overview Upon entering the growing financial technology FinTech industry, Avant developed proprietary software that attempts to efficiently mitigate default risk and fraud by using machine-learning technology. The company has worked towards a fully online experience where customers can apply on Avant's website. This eliminates the need for physical branches, but also is able to simplify the borrowing process, with the bulk of its employment verification and funding done over the internet. In April 2015, Avant launched the Avant Institutional Marketplace with global alternative asset manager Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Victory Park Capital, and Jefferies as lead investors. The $400 million forward-flow financing arrangement enables institutional investors to purchase loans originated through the Avant technology platform and benefits Avant by diversifying funding sources.  Company establishment  After graduating from the Y Combinator startup program in 2012, Sun and Zhang looked to build their business, Debteye, a platform designed to help individuals manage their debt by making informed decisions based on their unique financial situation. With no income, Sun sought a personal loan at a traditional brick-and-mortar establishment. Sun found the process of applying for and obtaining a loan frustrating and time-consuming. This, along with Sun and Zhang's Y Combinator venture, became the inspiration for what became Avant. As former interns of Goldstein's at Enova, Sun and Zhang saw an opportunity to partner with the Chicago entrepreneur in December 2012 and built a product that made borrowing a more streamlined process. The startup set up its headquarters in Chicago where it raised an initial $1 million in seed funding.

Career After graduating from Harvard University, Preston Remington (1897–1958) joined The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Department of Decorative Arts in 1923 as an assistant under curator Joseph Breck.Dictionary of Art Historians. Retrieved 25 July 2014. He served for the remainder of his career as assistant curator (1924–1928), associate curator (1929–1933), curator in the newly formed Department of Renaissance and Modern Art (1934–1950) and its successor Department of Renaissance Art (1950–1957), and research curator there from 1957 to 1958.Preston Remington records, 1925–1970, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014. After Breck's death in 1933, the department was divided into the three separate departments, Medieval art (under James J. Rorimer), Renaissance and Post-Renaissance art (under Remington), and American Art (under Joseph Downs). He later advanced to the Vice-Directorship of the Department of Renaissance and Post-Renaissance Art. Remington chaired the Museum's Committee on Architectural Rearrangement from 1941 to 1943. Composed of Museum curators and administrators, the Committee was tasked with surveying individual departments' existing storage, display, and conservation spaces to assist in future planning for Museum expansion. In the 1950s, Remington worked on the installation of the period rooms of the Museum, opened in 1954. Throughout his career, he published extensively in his Museum's journals on objects in its collection. Remington was named Vice Director of the Museum in 1949, which combined major administrative responsibilities with a curatorial role, he retired from that position due to ill health in 1955. He continued to work on a catalogue of the Museum’s French silver, which had been bequeathed in large part by Catherine D. Wentworth during his tenure as curator. Remington also maintained relationships with major donors to the museum such as Jules Bache, Susan Dwight Bliss, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Harkness, and George Dupont Pratt. After Remington's death on April 7, 1958, Director James Rorimer noted that “The major accomplishment during his later years of service to the Museum was the installation of the collections of post-renaissance [sic] decorative arts in the new galleries,” including the reconstruction of period rooms that opened in November 1954.Rorimer, James J. \\"Preston Remington.\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series Vol. 16, No. 9 (May 1958).

History The company was stablished in 1901 as the consolidation of the Danbury and Goldens Bridge Street Railway of Connecticut and the Goldens Bridge Electric Railway of New York, and set out to build from Danbury. The motivation was to provide a faster passenger route to New York than that offered by the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Railroad. Construction progressed slowly. Tracks were laid from a connection with the Danbury and Bethel Street Railway near the Danbury Fairgrounds, west through Ridgebury and eventually just across the state line to North Salem, New York by 1901. Aside from a few test runs with cars borrowed from the Danbury and Bethel line, there is no indication that regular service was ever offered on the partially completed line. In 1902, the project was acquired by the Westchester Traction Company, and immediately investors were sought to continue construction. This extended the roadbed grade to Goldens Bridge, but no further rails were ever laid. Permission was obtained to open between Danbury and Ridgebury in 1903 and a limited service was operated, possibly by the Danbury and Bethel Street Railway, but this was short-lived.Sanders, J: Ridgefield Chronicles, A Frenzy over Railroads 2014 Looking to recoup some of the shareholder's investment, the company directors ordered the rails to be lifted sometime between 1910 and 1915, and the project was abandoned. Much of the line is traceable around Ridgefield, including a section called Old Trolley Road, and earthworks survive here and there.

She had a successful 52 year career and played in over 40 pantomimes between 1905 and 1957. Early career Ward as Prince Charming in Cinderella (1906) Ward was born in Aston (now part of Birmingham), Warwickshire, on 26 April 1890,1891 England Census for Dorothy Ward: Warwickshire, Birmingham, St George - Ancestry.com to Eliza (née Millichamp, 1867–1946) and Edwin Ward (1866–), a wholesale bottler. When she was 14 she was taken to see Jack and the Beanstalk with Ada Reeve as the principal boy, and from that moment she decided on a career in pantomime. She made her stage début at the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham in 1905, aged 15, playing Zenobia in the pantomime Bluebeard. Following her success in this Robert Courtneidge offered her the role of Betty in the Edwardian musical comedy The Dairymaids at the Apollo Theatre in London (1906) opposite Phyllis Dare and Walter Passmore.Photograph of Dorothy Ward in The Dairymaids - National Portrait Gallery, London CollectionJ.

She next created the non-speaking role of Etoff in Edward German's comic opera Tom Jones at the Apollo Theatre in London (1907),Cast list for Tom Jones (1907) - British Musical Theatre website and in 1908 she played Princess Helene in the operetta A Waltz Dream at the Hicks Theatre.Wearing, The London Stage 1900-1909, p. 399D. Forbes- Winslow, Daly's - The Biography of a Theatre, W. H. Allen & Co., London (1944) This was followed by George Edwardes's production of Havana at the Gaiety Theatre before joining the cast of The Gay Gordons at the Aldwych Theatre. In his history of Daly's Theatre D. Forbes Winslow wrote of this period: > Dorothy said one of the happiest times of her life was when she was with > George Edwardes at the Gaiety Theatre, understudying at the age of sixteen > several parts in Havana. She got her chance to play the lead. Edwardes gave > her her first big chance in London as the Princess in A Waltz Dream. After > the first performance he presented her with a quaint ring: it consisted of > two large diamonds, set one on each side of a shamrock leaf in emeralds – > similar to the one he gave to Lily Elsie when she made her first big hit in > The Merry Widow. She played Robin Hood in the pantomime The Babes in the Wood at the Prince of Wales Theatre in her home town of Birmingham (1909–10) followed by the title role in the pantomime Little Jack Horner at Newcastle in (1910–11) in which the Dame was played by the young Irish actor Shaun Glenville. The two married in 1911.England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837-1915 for Dorothy Ward (1911( - Ancestry.com Their son was the actor and director Peter Glenville (1913-1996). Peak years Dorothy Ward as Cora Angélique in The Whirl of New York (1921) Ward became noted as one of the leading principal boys, while Glenville as \\"a pantomime Dame without equal\\".W. MacQueen-Pope, The Melodies Linger On: The Story of Music Hall, (London: W.H. Allen, 1950), p. 340 Thus, for 50 years they often played mother and son. They appeared in pantomimes together until 1914 when Ward was cast as Louise opposite Fay Compton and Cicely Courtneidge in The Cinema Star, which toured the provinces before opening at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London. In 1916 she was in We’re All In It at the London Hippodrome, touring throughout 1917 before being reunited with Glenville in Happy Go Lucky (1918). For much of 1921 she was with her husband in New York where she was Phoebe Throssel in Quality Street at the Shubert Theatre and Cora Angélique in The Whirl of New York at the Winter Garden Theatre. Ward's performance in Quality Street gained harsh reviews from some critics, with Dorothy Parker commenting; 'They have brought over from England a lady named Dorothy Ward to play the title role of Phoebe in Quality Street and, considering what a first-class passage costs these days, it seems really staggering to think of the money that could have been saved by the simple means of letting her stay happily at home... she has been billed by a hysterical press agent, as \\"England's greatest comédienne\\". I don't pretend to be right up to the minute with what is going on upon the British stage, but I can say with perfect safety that if she is England's greatest comédienne, then I'm Mrs. Fiske'.Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker: Complete Broadway, 1918–1923, iUniverse LLC (2014) - Google Books p. 224 Another critic wrote that Ward's was the season's 'most astonishing piece of casting' and that she approached her role in the 'dainty' operetta 'in the frenzied manner usually reserved for the mad scenes in Italian opera'. Her husband fared little better.Dan Dietz, The Complete Book of 1920s Broadway Musicals, Rowman & Littlefield 2019) - Google Books p. 62 Ward and Glenville had been cast in Mother Goose at the Alhambra Theatre in Glasgow for the Christmas pantomime in 1921. At the last minute, however, Ward was called to replace Clarice Mayne in Jack and the Beanstalk at the London Hippodrome opposite George Robey. In 1926 the couple were in The Apache at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle before taking it on tour and then opening at the London Palladium in 1927. Next they were next on tour in The Blue Train. She was Cora Angélique in a revival of The Belle of New York at Daly's Theatre in London (1931), and followed this as Lady Holyrood in a revival of Florodora. Next she was Nan in A Country Girl, followed by The Duchess of Dantzic. With Glenville she ended the 1932 season in La poupée. At the outbreak of World War II Ward was among the first entertainers to join ENSA, for whom she toured France entertaining the troops. By now the couple were quite wealthy and included a Rolls Royce car among their possessions. The actor Roy Hudd wrote of Ward's appearance as Colin the Miller's Son in a pantomime of Puss in Boots in 1941: > At the dress rehearsal she made her first entrance in her \\"poor boy\\" costume > but wearing a positive fistful of diamond rings. She was very proud of how > well she'd done, and wanted everyone else to know it too.

P. Wearing, The London Stage 1940-1949: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel, Rowman & Littlefield (2014) - Google Books p. 172 By the 1950s Ward was beginning to wonder if she could still carry off the principal boy roles. In an interview in 1954 while appearing as Dick Whittington at the Kingston Empire she was reluctant to discuss her date of birth, saying, \\"I want audiences to enjoy the pantomime – not to wonder if I’ve got my own teeth!\\" In 1957 she made her last appearance as principal boy at the age of 66 playing the lead in Dick Whittington at the Pavilion Theatre in Liverpool, bringing to an end a career in which she had played principal boy almost continuously since 1905. Songs and recordings Sheet music cover for 'Open Your Heart And Let The Sunshine In' (1920) During her career Ward performed a number of songs by her and Glenville's friend, Fred Godfrey, including: 'Meet Me Jenny When The Sun Goes Down' in pantomime in Belfast in 1908. Ward is known to have recorded four Godfrey songs: 'Blue Eyes' (Regal G-7170, 1915); 'Tommy’s Learning French' (Regal G-7219, 1915); 'I Love My Motherland' (Regal G-7418, 1916); and 'Take Me Back To Dear Old Blighty' (Regal G-7398, 1916). Also, from information gathered from sheet music covers and other sources she also sang Godfrey’s 'It’s The Way They Have In The Navy' (1914); 'I’m Coming Back To Old Kilkenny' (1915); 'Take Me Back To Your Heart' (1915); 'You Were The First One To Teach Me To Love' (1916); 'Down Texas Way' (1917); 'Open Your Heart And Let The Sunshine In' (1920); 'Till You Come Back Again' (1926); 'Arm In Arm Together' (1931); and 'There Is Always A Silver Lining' (1939).

Inspections were very popular for the 113th as many wished to hear their three bands. In late May 1916, the battalion moved to Sarcee Camp outside Calgary for further training that lasted until September. During the time spent at Sarcee the battalion used painted rocks to construct their battalion number on nearby Signal Hill in Calgary. This bold white stone is still visible and preserved in Battalion Park. In early September 1916 orders came for the battalion to entrain for the east and by September 19 the battalion was on its way.

The trip across the Atlantic took ten days and upon arriving in England the battalion was taken to a holding camp at Sandling near Shorncliffe. It was at Sandling that Lieutenant-Colonel Pryce-Jones, the commanding officer, learned that the 113th would be broken up for replacements and would not see action as a unit after all. One can only imagine the disappointment of these men as they learned the fate of the 113th, their battalion, after 10 months training together. The 113th was transferred to the 17th Reserve Battalion, CEF, the Nova Scotia Highlanders, affiliated with the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders. The 17th was at Bramshott Camp located South of London. On October 12, 1916, most of the old 113th proceeded to France arriving at a camp near Le Havre France. Almost immediately 300 men of the old 113th were assigned as replacements to one of the most famous battalions in the CEF, the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish). An idea of the casualties suffered by the 16th in the Somme fighting of the fall of 1916 can be understood by this reinforcement. This would mean that roughly 30% of the 16th were new transfers from the 113th. The battalion disbanded on 1 September 1917.

The bill would clarify the law so that people did not have to get two permits in order to use the same pesticide. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Similar legislation, , passed the House and the Senate Agriculture Committee during the 112th United States Congress, but never received a full vote in the Senate and did not become law. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2013 would amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA)) to prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a state from requiring a permit under the CWA for a discharge from a point source into navigable waters of a pesticide authorized for sale, distribution, or use under FIFRA, or the residue of such a pesticide, resulting from the application of such pesticide. The bill would exempt from such prohibition the following discharges containing a pesticide or pesticide residue: (1) a discharge resulting from the application of a pesticide in violation of FIFRA that is relevant to protecting water quality, if the discharge would not have occurred but for the violation or the amount of pesticide or pesticide residue contained in the discharge is greater than would have occurred without the violation; (2) stormwater discharges regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES); and (3) discharges regulated under NPDES of manufacturing or industrial effluent or treatment works effluent and discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including a discharge resulting from ballasting operations or vessel biofouling prevention. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Agriculture on March 13, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 935 would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and states authorized to issue a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) from requiring a permit for some discharges of pesticides authorized for use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Under the bill, public and private entities would no longer need to obtain an NPDES permit for certain discharges of pesticides except in cases where the application of the pesticide would not fall under FIFRA, or in cases where the discharge is regulated as a stormwater, municipal, or industrial discharge under the Clean Water Act. Based on information from EPA, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting this legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Any administrative savings to EPA that might result from issuing fewer permits would be negligible because EPA has delegated the authority to issue most NPDES permits to states. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to H.R. 935 because enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 935 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 4, 2013 by Rep. Bob Gibbs (R, OH-7). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the United States House Committee on Agriculture, the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, and the United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture. On June 2, 2014 the bill was ordered reported alongside House Report 113-467. Debate and discussion Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA), who supported the bill, said that \\"federal agencies continue to develop and implement duplicative regulations that create undue burdens and more red tape for American citizens. H.R. 935 will provide clarity with EPA regulations, which will in turn allow citizens to better navigate the regulatory environment.\\" Rep. Mike McIntyre also supported the bill saying that the \\"bill is a great step toward reforming the regulatory process, streamlining government, and saving taxpayers' time and money.\\" Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR), a co-sponsor of the bill, explained his support by saying \\"under FIFRA pesticides must undergo extensive and rigorous testing before being approved. To require a duplicative permit for a pesticide that has already been approved through the FIFRA process is not only arbitrary, it's an unnecessary burden on regulators and applicators and does nothing to improve water quality.\\" The National Council of Farmer Cooperatives (NCFC) supported the bill. President Chuck Conner said that \\"the time for action on this issue is long overdue-farmers, growers and ranchers across the country are facing burdensome and redundant regulations and tremendous uncertainty for absolutely no environmental benefit.\\" Beyond impacting farmers, this bill could also affect other businesses such as those related to swimming pool chemicals. The bill was opposed by Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) when an attempt was made to include its provisions in the 2014 farm bill.

Today the collection belongs in the Coninx Museum which occupies the house where Werner once lived, in the Hottingen district on the east side of Zürich.

Народная звезда Светлана Курицына In December 2011 a short interview to the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti, in which Sveta tried to explain why she liked the party United Russia, was uploaded to YouTube. Some of Svetlana’s answers from this interview became popular memes of Russian Internet. For example, when prompted by the reporter to name a few major accomplishments of United Russia, she used phrases which could be translated into English as \\"we began to dress more betterer\\" and \\"There were more... lands... I don't even know how to put it... seeding more lands... Yeah. Vegetables, rye, all that stuff\\". The interview led some to speculate that Svetlana was using some kind of Newspeak to communicate her thoughts.

Originally started as a tag team named by Joe Doering and Suwama in October 2012, it was later turned into a stable when Kaz Hayashi, Shuji Kondo and Yasufumi Nakanoue joined the two. The stable was disbanded in June 2013, when Hayashi, Kondo and Nakanoue left AJPW, but Doering and Suwama came back together under the new name Evolution the following September and recruited Hikaru Sato as the stable's third member in February 2014. Suwama has held the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion twice and Doering once as representatives of the stable. The two are also former one-time World Tag Team Champions and won the 2013 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. In July 2014, Atsushi Aoki joined Evolution, bringing the World Junior Heavyweight Championship to the stable with him. As part of Evolution, Aoki and Sato formed a tag team named , becoming two-time All Asia Tag Team Champions and three-time winners of the Jr. Tag Battle of Glory tournament. History =Last Revolution (2012–2013)= Joe Doering On October 21, 2012, two longtime \\"generational rivals\\", Joe Doering and Suwama, faced each other in a match, which ended in a draw, after both men were counted out of the ring. After Suwama successfully pleaded for the match to be restarted, it ended in another draw less than three minutes later, when neither man was able to continue. Following the match, the two men shook hands, before Suwama announced that he was going to be taking part in the upcoming World's Strongest Tag Determination League and nominated Doering as his partner. On November 13, Suwama held a press conference to announce that he and Doering had come up with a name for their new tag team, \\"Last Revolution\\" (L/R), combining the names of the finishing moves of the two men; Suwama's Last Ride and Doering's Revolution Bomb. In the tournament, which ran from November 17 to 30 and was contested for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, Last Revolution made it all the way to the finals, before losing to Get Wild (Manabu Soya and Takao Omori). On March 4, 2013, Suwama announced that in order to counter the momentum of the new Burning stable, Last Revolution had recruited a new member, Shuji Kondo. Before the end of the month, Kondo's longtime tag team partner Kaz Hayashi also joined Last Revolution, while veteran wrestler Masahiro Chono acted as an unofficial advisor for members of the stable. On March 17, Suwama defeated Masakatsu Funaki for AJPW's top title, the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, bringing Last Revolution its first title. On April 29, Hayashi and Kondo faced Sushi and Yasufumi Nakanoue in a tag team match. Despite Hayashi pinning Nakanoue for the win, he and Kondo afterwards offered the rookie wrestler a spot in Last Revolution. Nakanoue immediately accepted the offer, thus becoming the stable's fifth member. However, the following June, after Nobuo Shiraishi took over as the new president of AJPW, Keiji Mutoh quit the promotion and was joined by wrestlers loyal to him, which included Hayashi, Kondo and Nakanoue, leading to Suwama announcing that Last Revolution would be disbanding following the June 30 AJPW event. =Evolution (2013–present)= Suwama On September 23, 2013, it was announced that Doering and Suwama were coming back together full time under the new team name \\"Evolution\\", challenging the reigning World Tag Team Champions, Burning's Go Shiozaki and Jun Akiyama, to a title match. The match took place on October 22 and saw Evolution defeat Burning to become the new World Tag Team Champions. With the win, Suwama, now holding the three Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship belts and two World Tag Team Championship belts, became AJPW's first \\"Quintuple Crown Champion\\" in 12 years. However, just five days later, Suwama lost the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Akebono. On December 8, Doering and Suwama solidified their spot as AJPW's top tag team by defeating Xceed's Go Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara in the finals to win the 2013 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. On February 16, 2014, Evolution was once again turned into a stable, when Suwama accepted Hikaru Sato's direct appeal and made him Evolution's third member, tasking him with bringing the World Junior Heavyweight Championship over to the stable. Suwama and Doering's reign as the World Tag Team Champions came to an end on June 28, when they lost the title to Wild Burning (Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori). However, the very next day, Suwama defeated Omori to recapture the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. On July 27, after successfully defending the World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Hikaru Sato, Atsushi Aoki announced he was joining Evolution. Later that same event, Evolution's two original members faced off in a match, where Doering defeated Suwama to win the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the first time.

On October 23, Aoki and Sato won their second Jr. Tag Battle of Glory in a row by winning the round-robin tournament with a record of three wins and one loss. In late 2015, following Go Shiozaki's departure from AJPW, Suwama offered his tag team partner Kento Miyahara a spot in Evolution. Though Miyahara turned down the offer, he agreed to team with Suwama in the 2015 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. After winning the tournament, Miyahara expressed interest in continuing to team up with Suwama, but was attacked by Suwama, who instead announced Naoya Nomura as the newest member of Evolution. On January 2, 2016, Suwama defeated Jun Akiyama to regain the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. However, Suwama was stripped of the title only ten days later after suffering an achilles tendon rupture. On February 21, Aoki defeated Sato in the finals to win the 2016 Jr. Battle of Glory and the vacant World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Aoki went on to lose the title to Sato on June 19. On July 24, Aoki and Sato defeated Isami Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto at a Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) event to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship, bringing it back to AJPW. On August 28, Sato lost the World Junior Heavyweight Championship to Soma Takao in his second defense at an event held by DDT Pro- Wrestling. On September 19, Suwama defeated Zeus in the finals to win the 2016 Ōdō Tournament. Around the same time, Naoya Nomura left Evolution to join Kento Miyahara's Nextream stable. On November 17, Aoki and Sato won their third Jr. Tag Battle of Glory in a row by defeating Soma Takao and Yuma Aoyagi in a playoff match. On November 27, Aoki and Sato lost the All Asia Tag Team Championship to veteran wrestlers Atsushi Onita and Masanobu Fuchi, who became the 100th champions in the title's history. On January 2, 2017, Joe Doering returned to AJPW after being sidelined for 18 months due to a brain tumor, teaming with Evolution stablemates Hikaru Sato and Suwama in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Jake Lee, Kento Miyahara and Naoya Nomura. On April 28, Sato defeated Keisuke Ishii to win the World Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On June 20, Aoki and Sato defeated Onita and Fuchi to regain the All Asia Tag Team Championship. On July 30, Sato lost the World Junior Heavyweight Championship to Tajiri in his fifth defense. That same day, Doering quit Evolution, which was followed by Sato also quitting the stable just four days later after losing to Suwama in a grappling match. Suwama and Doering immediately started feuding with each another, with Doering vowing to kill his former stable. On September 23, Suwama first defeated Doering in the semifinals and then Shuji Ishikawa in the finals to win his second Ōdō Tournament in a row. On October 9, Suwama defeated Kento Miyahara to regain the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Doering on October 21.

The song, released on Decca Records became a hit for Griffin A standard of country music, the tune was covered by diverse acts. Jimmie Davis' 1939 version became a hit, while it was covered by diverse country acts. Writing and original recording In 1937, singer-songwriter Rex Griffin wrote \\"The Last Letter\\" while he was living in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was inspired to write the song after he was left by his wife. The lyrics told the story of a suicide letter written by a common man directed to a woman seeking a rich husband and the finer things in life. It described his bitterness, and pain for the end of their romance. The song probably inspired Hank Williams's similar \\"Mansion On The Hill.\\" Griffin recorded \\"The Last Letter\\" during a New York session on May 13, 1937. The single, backed with \\"Over the River\\" on the flipside was released the same year on Decca Records. Despite that \\"The Last Letter\\" turned into a hit, the poor sales of Griffin caused his dismissal by the label. The song became later considered a standard of Country music. Griffin wrote and recorded a sequel called \\"Answer To The Last Letter\\" in 1939. Cover versions Country singer Jimmie Davis recorded the song again in 1939, turning it again into a hit. It was covered as well by The Blue Sky Boys and The Carter Family. In 1963, Ernest Tubb recorded a cover version for his Rex Griffin tribute album Just Call Me Lonesome.

Oh, Oh\\" Illustration by Franz Kuderna (1882–1943) from Nesthäkchens Erstes Schuljahr (1915). In the first class, which is the tenth in the old count, are fifty pupils. The class teacher is an attractive, sympathetic lady, Miss Hering. Anne Marie makes friends with the neighbor's daughter, Margot Thielen, and two cousins, Marlene Ulrich and Ilse Hermann. Also Anne Marie is attracted to the naughty Hilde Rabe. The book describes the school day in the German Empire. In class a hierarchy is introduced. The best students are in front, the bad ones sit in back. Anne Marie is a good student, but she does not remain long in first place. Not only her performance but also her behavior and orderliness are graded. Anne Marie is soon surpassed by her friend Margot Thielen, who is less talented but a good child. In the editions of the book prior to the 1980s, Anne Marie's mother explains to her daughter that orderliness and behavior are more important than good grades for a girl.Pech, Klaus-Ulrich: Ein Nesthaken als Klassiker.

The bird dies, and Anne Marie feels for the first time that sloppiness can have dire consequences. She gets a new bird for Christmas, whom she believes is her old bird born again. She becomes - at least until the end of the book - an orderly child and is permitted to give a children's party as a reward. The difficult art of knitting Anne Marie learns from her grandmother. During the summer holidays she travels with her parents to Johannesbad (Janské Lázně) in the Riesengebirge (the venue of the holiday was not changed after 1945). Critical reception \\"A young family favorite charms her teacher in this affecting novel from a century ago. Readers should be transported not only to an earlier era’s childhood world, but to a glowingly idealized version of that realm, and they will likely be as enchanted by Annemarie as were Ury’s original readers.\\" Kirkus Reviews Kirkus Review of Nesthäkchen's First School Year Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesthäkchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 – 16 years old. A Backfisch (“teenage girl”, literally “fish for frying”) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesthäkchen series with volume 6, Nesthäkchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesthäkchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesthäkchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesthäkchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesthäkchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesthäkchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesthäkchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

It lies within the eponymous nature reserve in the Rhön Biosphere Reserve and is part of the Europe-wide conservation system, Natura 2000.Natura 2000 Hesse The Red Moor has an area of 50 hectares and is the second largest raised bog in the High Rhön after the Black Moor (66.4 hectares). For 175 years, until 1984, peat was cut here. The interior of the raised bog is severely damaged, especially as a result of the many years of peat cutting. Its perimeters are however still largely undisturbed areas that are better and more typically developed than the Black Moor, 8 kilometres away. In 1979 large-scale renaturalisation measures began.  Geography  Overview map of the Red Moor Nature Reserve The Red Moor is the largest raised bog in Hesse, followed by the moor in the Breungeshain Heath (4 ha) on the uplands of the Vogelsberg.Stiftung Hessischer Naturschutz (publ.): Naturschutzgebiet Rotes Moor im Biosphärenreservat Rhön. p. 6. In the Rhön it is the second largest bog after the Black Moor; others being the Great Moor (Großes Moor, 8 ha) and Little Moor (Kleines Moor, 2 ha) on the Stirnberg, and the Moorlein on the Rasenberg.Willy Kiefer: Die Moore der Rhön. p. 8. As a result of centuries of peat extraction, which lasted until the 1980s, only an area of about five hectares is left as a core zone. The Red Moor is divided into two areas: The Great Red Moor (Großes Rotes Moor, formerly 32 hectares of raised bog – today just under 11 ha) and the Little Red Moor (Kleines Rotes Moor, formerly 7 hectares of raised bog – today 1.7 ha).Stiftung Hessischer Naturschutz (Hrsg.): Naturschutzgebiet Rotes Moor im Biosphärenreservat Rhön. p. 21. It lies about five kilometres southeast of the Wasserkuppe on the B 278 federal highway between the village of Ehrenberg (part of Wüstensachsen) on the Hessian side and the town of Bischofsheim an der Rhön on the Bavarian side of the state border. The bog measures about a kilometre from north to south and 600 metres from west to east. Its lowest point at the southern end of the moor is about 804 metres above sea level and it climbs towards the north to about 830 metres ASL. The moor is bounded by the surrounding mountains which, running clockwise, are the Mathesberg (831.8 m) to the north, the Ottilienstein (846.4 m) to the northeast, the Heidelstein (925.7 m) to the east, the Kesselstein (799.2 m) to the south, the Mostberg (807.4 m) to the west and the Feldberg (815.2 m) to the northwest.Hessian State Survey Office (publ.): Topographical map 1:25,000 series – 5525 Gersfeld (Rhön). Birch woodland The Red Moor lies in the southern part of the Red Moor Nature Reserve which covers an area of 314.7 hectares. This reserve, designated in 1979, the name of which is taken from the raised bog, lies mostly above the 800 metre contour, but elevations range from 720 to 835 metres above Normalnull. It is one of the oldest and largest nature reserves in Hesse and lies between the Wasserkuppe and the Heidelstein on the gently rolling saddle of the High Rhön. It measures 3.5 kilometres from north to south and 0.6 to 1.2 kilometres from east to west. There are other smaller wetlands with thinner layers of peat in the nature reserve formed around three hollows, each the source of a stream. The stream draining the lowest point of the moor is the Moorwasser (\\"bog water\\"). It flows south into the Schwarzbach, which discharges into the Brend at Bischofsheim its waters making their way via the Franconian Saale to the drainage basin of the Rhine. Within the moor itself, the Moorwasser separates the Little Red Moor to the southeast from the Great Red Moor to the northwest. Above the tailstream of the artificial embankment built in 1973 is a small reservoir. Another source stream, the Feldbach, flows westwards into the Fulda. A third stream, the Grumbach, flows northwards into the Ulster, a tributary of the Werra. The Werra and Fulda later converged to form the Weser. The reserve thus lies on the watershed between the Rhine and the Weser.Stiftung Hessischer Naturschutz (publ.): Naturschutzgebiet Rotes Moor im Biosphärenreservat Rhön. p. 5.  Tourism  The Red Moor ist well developed for tourists and is a popular destination in the Rhön. It is open to the public and wheelchair friendly. Guided walks through the moor are conducted several times a week. About 500 metres east of the information pavilion of the Red Moor, on the road from Wüstensachsen to Bischofsheim an der Rhön, there is a large car park and the Haus am Roten Moor (House by the Red Moor), built in 2003/04, with toilets, a kiosk and information boards. The timber-framed house was opened on 3 September 2004 and has an area of about 150 square metres.NABU Landesverband Hessen The main entry to the Red Moor Cross Country Skiing Centre is also from this car park.

He was the first person to cross the Atlantic single-handed in both directions, and wrote several books about his pioneering sailing adventures. Biography Born in Walton-on- Thames, Surrey, in 1914, Allcard was educated at Eton College.Source has a typo, \\"Estonian\\" for \\"Etonian\\" He went on to take an apprenticeship in the shipbuilding yards of Harland and Wolff, in Glasgow, and later with D & W Henderson, on the Clyde, and qualified as a naval architect before World War II. He was the longest-standing member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. Allcard learned to sail at the age of six, taught by his grandfather's boatman, and owned his first sailing dinghy at the age of 12. Over the course of his life he has owned 18 sailing boats. He made his first single-handed voyage in 1939, sailing from Scotland to Norway and back. In 1949 Allcard crossed the Atlantic ocean single-handed, in 81 days, aboard his 35-foot wooden ketch Temptress (previously sailed by Ocean Cruising Club founder Humphrey Barton). Upon completion of his return voyage in 1951, Allcard became the first man in history to sail the Atlantic solo in both directions. During the return crossing, after leaving the Azores, he found a 23-year-old female stowaway aboard his yacht – an event widely reported at the time in the international press. Allcard wrote two books about his single- handed Atlantic crossings: Single-Handed Passage, and Temptress Returns. He appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 26 July 1955. On a subsequent Atlantic crossing in 1957, Allcard challenged fellow yachtsman Peter Tangvald to what would be the first ever east-to-west single-handed transatlantic race. Between the years of 1957 and 1973, Allcard completed a protracted solo circumnavigation aboard his 36-foot wooden ketch Sea Wanderer, which he had bought as a derelict hull in New York in 1950 for $250. His book Voyage Alone describes his hundred-day, non-stop run from Antigua, in the West Indies, to the River Plate in southern South America. His subsequent year-long trip around Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and Cape Horn is described in his book Solo around Cape Horn – and beyond, published in December 2016, fifty years after this part of his pioneering voyage. In 1967 Allcard met his future wife, Clare, 31 years his junior. In 1968 they drove from the UK to Singapore in a Land Rover. In 1969 their daughter Kate was born. After Allcard had completed his circumnavigation, the family bought the 69 ft gaff-rigged ex-Baltic trader Johanne Regina, built in 1929. Over the course of the next 30 years they restored the vessel whilst cruising aboard her, from the Caribbean to Europe and then to the Seychelles, and on to spend four years cruising in the Far East UK She magazine Feb 1982 and June 1986 before eventually sailing back to Europe. In 2006, at the age of 91, Allcard sold his last boat, Johanne Regina, to the sail-training organisation \\"Associació Amics del quetx Ciutat Badalona\\", and moved ashore to a house in the mountains of Andorra, where he celebrated his 100th birthday in October 2014. Allcard released his last book Solo around Cape Horn – and beyond in late 2016, at the age of 102. It describes his 1966 voyage around Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, as part of his solo circumnavigation. Allcard died in La Massana, Andorra, on 28 July 2017, at the age of 102, from complications relating to a broken leg he had suffered some weeks earlier.

In combination with counseling, it is used to treat opioid use disorder. It decreases withdrawal symptoms for about 24 hours. Buprenorphine/naloxone is available for use in two different forms, under the tongue or in the cheek. Side effects may include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), small pupils, sleepiness, and low blood pressure. The risk of overdose is lower with buprenorphine/naloxone than with methadone. However, people are more likely to stop treatment on buprenorphine/naloxone than methadone. Methadone, or buprenorphine alone, are generally preferred when treatment is required during pregnancy. Buprenorphine, at lower doses, results in the usual opioid effects; however, high doses beyond a certain level do not result in greater effects. This is believed to result in a lower risk of overdose than some other opioids. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that competes with and blocks the effect of other opioids (including buprenorphine) if given by injection. Naloxone is poorly absorbed when taken by mouth and it is added to decrease the risk that people will misuse the medication by injection. Misuse by injection or use in the nose, however, still occurs. Rates of misuse in the United States appear to be lower than with other opioids. The combination formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2002, and in the European Union in November 2017. A generic version was approved in the US in June 2018. In 2017, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Sublingual tablets Film (package) Buprenorphine/naloxone is used for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Long term outcomes are generally better with use of buprenorphine/naloxone than attempts at stopping opioid use altogether. This includes a lower risk of overdose with medication use. Due to the high binding affinity and low activation at the opioid receptor, cravings and withdrawal for opioids are decreased while preventing a person from getting high and relapsing on another opioid. The combination of the two medications is preferred over buprenorphine alone for maintenance treatment due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation, which helps function as an abuse deterrent, especially against intravenous use. Buprenorphine/naloxone has been found to be effective for treating opioid dependence, and serves as a recommended first line medication according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. The medication is an effective maintenance therapy for opioid dependence and has generally similar efficacy to methadone, which are both substantially more effective than abstinence- based treatment. Because it may be prescribed out of an office setting (as opposed to methadone which requires specialized centers), buprenorphine/naloxone allows for more freedom of administration for the person. It also thus comes with more risks in this vulnerable population. Buprenorphine/naloxone may be recommended for socially stable opioid users who may not be able to retrieve medications from a center daily, who may have another condition requiring regular primary care visits, or who may have jobs or daily lives that require they maintain all their faculties and cannot take a sedating medication. Buprenorphine/naloxone is also recommended over methadone in people who may be at high risk of methadone toxicity, such as the elderly, those taking high doses of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs, concomitant alcohol abusers, those with a lower level of opioid tolerance, and those at high risk of prolonged QT interval. It is also helpful to use the medication in combination with psychosocial support and counseling for the person. =Available forms= Buprenorphine/naloxone is available in sublingual formulations (that is, products that are dissolved under the tongue). There is no evidence that the tablet formulation is easier to divert and abuse compared to the film formulation, or that the tablet formulation is harder for children to accidentally ingest. There are various pharmacokinetic differences between sublingual formulations. Contraindications Contraindications are severe respiratory or liver impairment and acute alcoholism. There are limited accounts of cross-reactivity with opioids, but there is a possibility. Serious central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression may also occur with concurrent use of CNS depressants, ingesting alcohol, or other CNS depressing factors while on buprenorphine/naloxone. Adverse effects Side effects are similar to those of buprenorphine and other opioids. In addition, naloxone can induce withdrawal symptoms in people who are addicted to opioids. The most common side effects (in order of most common to least common) of sublingual tablets include: headaches, opioid withdrawal syndrome, pain, increased sweating, low blood pressure, and vomiting. The most common side effects seen in film formulations are tongue pain, decreased sensation and redness in the mouth, headache, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating, constipation, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, sleeping difficulties, pain, and swelling of the extremities. Buprenorphine/naloxone has a milder side effect profile than methadone, and has limited respiratory effects, due to both agonist/antagonist effects. However, buprenorphine/naloxone may be less safe than methadone in people with stable liver disease, since it can elevate liver enzymes. =Dependence and withdrawal= Buprenorphine/naloxone, when taken in excess, can produce dysphoric symptoms for non opioid-dependent/tolerant individuals due to buprenorphine being a partial opioid agonist. The sublingual formulation of the buprenorphine/naloxone combination was designed to reduce abuse potential via the injection route in comparison to buprenorphine alone. If the combination is taken via the sublingual route, as directed, the addition of naloxone does not diminish the effects of buprenorphine. When the combination sublingual tablet is dissolved and injected by opioid-dependent individuals, a withdrawal effect may be triggered due to the high parenteral bioavailability of naloxone. While this mechanism can potentially act to deter abuse, the Suboxone formulation still has potential to produce an opioid agonist \\"high\\" if abused sublingually by non-dependent persons, leading to dependence on opioids.Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction. Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 40. Laura McNicholas. US Department of Health and Human Services. Interactions The sedating/narcotic effect of buprenorphine is increased by other sedating drugs such as other opioids, benzodiazepines, first generation antihistamines, alcohol, and antipsychotics. In addition, opioids and especially benzodiazepines increase the risk for potentially lethal respiratory depression. Strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, moderately increase buprenorphine concentrations; CYP3A4 inducers can theoretically decrease concentrations of buprenorphine. Pharmacology A theoretical model of activity: buprenorphine/naloxone at opioid receptor when taken sublingually (top) versus when injected intravenously (bottom). =Mechanism of action= Buprenorphine binds strongly to opioid receptors and acts as a pain-reducing medication in the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to the μ-opioid receptor with high affinity which produces the analgesic effects in the CNS. It is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist and it is a weak κ-opioid receptor antagonist. As the dose of buprenorphine increases, its analgesic effects reach a plateau, and then it starts to act like an antagonist. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine binds and activates the opioid receptors, but has only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist, even at maximal receptor occupancy. It is thus well-suited to treat opioid dependence, as it produces milder effects on the opioid receptor with lower dependence and abuse potential. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that competes with opioid molecules in the CNS and prevents them from binding to the opioid receptors. Naloxone's binding affinity is highest for the μ-opioid receptor, then the δ-opioid receptor, and lowest for the κ-opioid receptor. Naloxone has poor bioavailability, and is rapidly inactivated following oral administration. When injected however, it exerts its full effects. Because of the differing bioavailability between the two medications in this combination, buprenorphine/naloxone works as an abuse deterrent: when taken sublingually as prescribed, the buprenorphine effects at the opioid receptor dominate, while the naloxone effects are negligible due to the low oral absorption. However, when someone attempts to misuse the medication either via injection or inhalation, the naloxone is intended to act as an antagonist and either reduce the euphoric effects of the opioid or even precipitate withdrawal in those currently dependent on opioids. This helps reduce the abuse potential relative to buprenorphine, although it does not eradicate it. One reason that naloxone might have limited efficacy as an abuse deterrent is that buprenorphine binds more tightly to the mu-opioid receptor than naloxone. =Pharmacokinetics= There are small differences in the pharmacokinetics between different sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone products. These differences may require changes in dose when a person switches from taking one product to another. The buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film (e.g. trade name Suboxone) achieves higher buprenorphine maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC, a measure of total drug exposure) than the original buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets at equal doses. For example, at a buprenorphine/naloxone dose of 8 mg/2 mg, the buprenorphine Cmax after a single dose of the original tablet formulation is around 3 ng/mL whereas that of the 8 mg/2 mg film formulation is around 3.55 ng/mL. The Zubsolv trade name sublingual tablets have higher buprenorphine bioavailability than the original sublingual tablets, while the Bunavail trade name buccal films have the highest bioavailability. For example, a single dose of Bunavail 4.2 mg/0.7 mg achieves a Cmax around 3.41 ng/mL. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme called CYP3A4, into norbuprenorphine. The glucuronidation of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by the UDP- glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, while norbuprenorphine is glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into bile. The elimination half-life of buprenorphine is 20 to 73 hours (mean 37 hours). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, there is no risk of accumulation in people with kidney problems. Naloxone Naloxone is extensively inactivated by first-pass metabolism in the liver, meaning that use of buprenorphine/naloxone as prescribed should not lead to active naloxone in the blood (which, as an opioid antagonist, would reverse the effect of buprenorphine or other opioids). Society and culture =Cost= In the United States the wholesale cost as of 2017 is between 2.32 and 3.15 per day. In the United Kingdom a similar dose costs the NHS £0.90 to £2.72 per day, according to 2015 data. While the cost of the medication buprenorphine/naloxone is greater than buprenorphine alone one analysis predicted the overall costs would be less in the United States due to less risk of abuse. =Access in the United States= Before the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA), physicians were not allowed to prescribe narcotics to treat opioid dependence. People with narcotic dependence would have to go to registered clinics to receive treatment. With DATA, Suboxone was the first medication approved for office-based treatment for opioid dependence. Suboxone has thus become widely used as a replacement for methadone as it can be prescribed by doctors in their offices, while methadone can only be provided at specialized addiction centers of which there are a limited number, often making access difficult. Some physicians are also leading a movement to begin prescribing it out of the emergency department (ED), as some small studies have shown ED-initiated Suboxone to be effective with people more likely to remain in addiction treatment compared to those either referred to addiction treatment programs or those receiving just a brief intervention in the department. Access to Suboxone can be limited due to varying prior authorization requirements across different insurers. Prior authorization is used by insurance companies to limit the use of certain medications by requiring approval before the insurance company will pay for the medication. This can influence a person's financial access and adherence. Financial access is determined through prior authorization approval, which the prescriber must request before the person can start the medication. The time it takes to have the request approved can delay the person in starting the medication. The prior authorization process can also impact adherence, because the approval is needed for every prescription or every couple months. This presents the potential for a gap in treatment and withdrawal symptoms as the person waits for approval. Several insurance companies, as well as Medicaid in various states, have removed the use of prior authorization for Suboxone in the attempt to increase access to this treatment. =Controversies= In July 2019, the British company Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Group) and its current/former affiliated entities (notably Indivior, which split from RB Group in 2014) settled with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the sale and marketing of brand name Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone). The non- prosecution agreement involves RB Group paying up to $1.4 billion, the largest settlement payment in US history involving an opioid-class medication. The case alleged anti-competitive behavior by RB Group and Indivior surrounding the expiration of their regulatory exclusivity for Suboxone sublingual tablets. The DOJ alleged that RB Group and Indivior employed a \\"product hopping\\" scheme (when a firm ceases production of a product upon expiration of regulatory exclusivity, in favor of another product that still has regulatory exclusivity, in order to prevent generic manufacturer competition) by misrepresenting that the Suboxone sublingual film formulation was safer than the sublingual tablet formulation because \\"children are less likely to be accidentally exposed to the film product.\\" This was despite a lack of scientific evidence for that claim. The company also sponsored a complaint to the FDA, expressing concern that buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets (the very product that they formerly produced) was unsafe, requesting that applications for regulatory approval of generic products by other pharmaceutical companies (their competitors) be rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Since 1999, Quatuor Bozzini has been an original voice in new, experimental and classical music. Their skew is radically contemporary, propelling the hyper-creative Montréal scene, and beyond. Not content to parlay received wisdom, the quartet cultivates an ethos of risk-taking, and boldly venture off the beaten track. Quatuor Bozzini stands out with their “extraordinary playing” (Alex Ross, The New Yorker). With rigorous qualitative criteria, they have nurtured a vastly diverse repertoire, unbiased by the currents of fashion. This has led to over four hundred commissioned pieces, as well as close to five hundred premiered works. A Quatuor Bozzini concert is an intensely shared experience, with meticulous and sensuous attention to detail. Praised by its “intense musicality and immense sensitivity” (Musicworks, Canada), Quatuor Bozzini was qualified in the Bandcamp Daily as “one of the most daring string quartets of the entire world.” The group presents an annual concert series in Montréal and also tours extensively in Canada, the United States, South America and Europe. Notable festivals and venues include MärzMusik Berlin (DE); Guildhall Barbican, Aldeburgh, Huddersfield (UK); Klangspuren in Schwaz, Porgy&Bess; (AT); Festival Présences, Festival Riverrun (FR); Angelica, SoundSCAPE (IT); Oslo Poesi (NOR); Gaudeamus, Muziekgebouw, NovemberMusic (NL); Kortrijk (BEL); Ostrava Days (CZ); SIPFEST (ID); Tsuda Hall (JP) TIME:SPANS, Other Minds (USA).  Educational initiatives  To ensure continual development in their art, the quartet's musical laboratories, the Composer's Kitchen, Performer's Kitchen and Bozzini Lab, work to mentor and support new generations of composers and performers. The quartet runs its own recording label, Collection QB, and has issued critically acclaimed albums, many of which have become reference recordings in the field. They have also issued albums with Edition Wandelweiser, Another Timbre, Wergo-Deutscher Musikrat, Centrediscs and ATMA Classique.  Awards  In 2018, Quatuor Bozzini was awarded the Prix Opus — Performer of the Year by the Conseil québécois de la musique. Finalist to the 28th Grand Prix (Conseil des arts de Montréal, 2012), Quatuor Bozzini is also the recipient of three Opus Prizes “International Outreach” (2007), “Contemporary Disc of the Year” (2004), and “Discovery of the Year” (2001) as well as the Étoile-Galaxie Prize from Radio-Canada (2001), the Förderpreis Ernst von Siemens Musikstiftung (2007), the German Record Critics Prize for Arbor Vitae (2009) and the 2014 Friends of Canadian Music Award.  Interdisciplinary initiatives & Collaborators  The Quatuor Bozzini has participated in the development and presentation of many interdisciplinary projects.

The purpose of barrier is to prevent terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and infiltrations across the approximately international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Major-General Shaukat Sultan, a former Pakistani military spokesman, said the move was necessary to block the infiltration of militants across the border into Pakistan. The initially proposed fortifications and fence, about in length, was backed by the United States in 2005. Construction on the border barrier unilaterally began in March 2017 following a series of deadly and costly clashes between Pakistani security forces and Afghan-aligned militants in Pakistan's tribal areas that greatly intensified hostilities in the War in North-West Pakistan. As of January 2019, about of fortifications and fencing have been constructed. The Afghanistan–Pakistan border is marked by 235 crossing points, many of which had been susceptible to illegal immigration and cross-border infiltrations. More importantly, it is designed to impede the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban from freely crossing the porous border, coordinating and launching attacks against the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Despite the two Taliban organizations claiming to be completely separate from each other, Afghan Taliban leaders have been found operating from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and Pakistani Taliban leaders have been found hiding from Pakistani law enforcement in Afghanistan while systemically coordinating a joint militant network with their Afghan counterparts. The project is predicted to cost at least $532 million. Initial fencing plans In September 2005, Pakistan stated it had plans to build a fence along its border (known as the Durand Line) with Afghanistan to prevent insurgents and drug smugglers slipping between the two countries. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf subsequently presented the prospect of mining the entire border as well. Despite the statements, no formal plan was finalized due to varying concerns and lack of consensus The plans to fence and mine the border were again considered in 2007 and then in 2009, but not implemented. However, a portion along selected border areas was fenced shortly after the idea resurfaced, following which work was discontinued due to a lack of funds. In June 2011, Major-General Athar Abbas, the then−spokesman of the Pakistan Army said: \\"We did fence around 35km of the border area as it faced continuous militant incursions. It was a joint project [with] ISAF and Afghanistan. But then they backed out. It was a very costly project.\\" During the Musharraf administration, Pakistan began to install biometric systems on all Durand Line border crossings. Afghanistan strongly objected to the system's installation while also continuing to protest Pakistan's fortification projects along the border. The biometric system network remains intact throughout the border's crossing points, although it is yet to be completed and made fully operational. Afghan opposition and Durand Line dispute Pakistani plans for fortifying, fencing and mining the border were renewed on 26 December 2006, but these plans were opposed by the Afghan government, citing that the fencing would result in \\"the limitation of the freedom of movement of tribal peoples\\". Due to Afghanistan's fierce opposition to the border fencing, the Angur Ada and Sheken areas saw a series of armed border skirmishes that resulted in cross−border artillery strikes launched by Pakistan in April 2007. On 1 April 2013, the Afghan Foreign Ministry formally protested and raised \\"grave concerns\\" over what it called \\"the Pakistani military's unilateral construction and physical reinforcement activities along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in eastern Nangarhar province\\". The widely perceived consensus in Afghanistan for non−recognition of the Durand Line as a legitimate border between Afghanistan and Pakistan largely stems from \\"historic\\" Afghan claims\\"Historic Afghan claims\\" does not imply that the modern-day Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's government claims the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in their entirety as most countries would in an international dispute, but rather that there is a more popular and stronger historical connection of these provinces to Afghanistan than India (out of which Pakistan was partitioned). The Afghan government has not explicitly outlined any territorial claims (of the nature you would find in the Kashmir conflict, as an example) but has disputed (although some Afghan officials have gone as far as calling for its abolishment entirely) the Durand Line as it currently stands, with the justification that it \\"unjustly\\" divides the ethnic Pashtun population. over Pakistan's provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and (to some extent) Balochistan, which are perceived to be dividing the ethnic homeland of the Pashtuns (a group native to and a majority in Afghanistan) in half. Afghanistan contends that the installation of a physical barrier of the nature that is being built by Pakistan would make this border more or less permanent. Afghanistan's territorial claims over Pakistani- administered land across the Durand Line is internationally unrecognized, as all United Nations member states recognize the Durand Line as Pakistan's undisputed western border with Afghanistan and Iran, the latter of which does not have any territorial claims or border disputes with Pakistan. Construction progress and trenches In June 2016, after three years of construction, Pakistan completed a trench along its border with Afghanistan from Balochistan to ensure proper border management. The initial excavation was largely carried out by the paramilitary Frontier Corps. The purpose of the trench is to tighten border security and create more favourable conditions for Pakistani security forces responsible for patrolling the border by deterring and restricting the flow of unauthorized entities, such as narcotics, militants, smugglers and general illegal movements of Afghan civilians or refugees. Three private construction companies out of Pakistan's Balochistan province were contracted to supply manpower and oversee the arrangement of necessary equipment. The and trench is planned to be extended along the whole border.

After a four-year tour of duty in the U.S. Air Force, he returned to school and earned a master's degree in social work from Atlanta University in 1957. =Professional career and achievements= Knight is best known for his devotion of his time to improving the lives of the underprivileged. It is documented that he turned down offers to become the County Manager for Dade County, in order to continue serving those who needed him more directly. He moved up to management positions and became the county's first black deputy county manager and assistant county manager.

He began his career in social work in a professional setting at the Kendall Children's Home in Miami, Florida in 1959. He was a caseworker who cared for the welfare of children and families throughout that community. He was noted for helping the voiceless, commitment for charity in his region, honesty and integrity. To honor his efforts, a \\"Dewey W. Knight, Jr./Ann-Marie Adker Fair Housing Center\\" was established in his honor. While he was a caseworker and the first black social worker for Kendall Children's Home, he helped to integrate the local youth home, despite threats of jail time from local courts while doing so.Velma Clarke Lawrence, Dewey Knight Jr., Miami Times, June 29, 1995. \\"With the sudden passing of Mr. Dewey Knight Jr. last Wednesday morning, Florida lost one of its most distinguished sons.\\" Knight eventually rose to the rank of department director for the Welfare Department. He was the first black individual to hold such a high position within the social services department in Dade County. His focus turned to providing intensive counseling for individuals as well as families on welfare and he opened the first Neighborhood Youth Cooperation Program that served out-of-school youth. He also established a residence home and halfway house for troubled teens. In 1969, he took on the interim role of head of the Division of Youth Services. He was heavily involved in the new War on Poverty program established by the federal government and also took on the challenge of working with the Neighborhood Development Program. In 1970, Knight accepted the role of Acting Director of Housing and Urban Development. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant County Manager—the first black person to command this post.

At Barry University, he taught and mentored upcoming administrators within the industry. His commitment to social work and community service programs earned him a wonderful reputation throughout Dade County and his impact stretched far beyond the county limits. Though he could well afford it with his rise in the ranks, Knight, a widower, never moved from his Liberty City home, where he raised his family and helped his neighbors. =Personal life= Knight married Clara Louise Brown and moved to her original birthplace of Miami in 1959. He and Clara had two sons, Dewey III and Patrick. Despite his social and professional successes, he continued to live in the same community, surrounded by the people that he not only served, but also considered friends and family, for the entirety of his life. Knight moved to Miami, birthplace of his wife, Clara Louise Brown, in 1959. His first job was at the Kendall Children's Home.

The lyrics describe a couple on the verge of conquering their inhibitions. Written in tribute to Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson, the song is one of three that were credited jointly to Harry Nilsson and Phil Spector, although Nilsson submitted that he was the sole writer on a 1966 copyright form. Spector produced MFQ's version in his Wall of Sound style, featuring a dense orchestration and a marching rhythm. He used it as the opening theme music for the 1966 rock concert film The Big TNT Show, for which he was the musical director and associate producer. (The film credits Spector as the sole author of the song.) The band itself does not appear in the film, but were originally planned to. MFQ was signed to Spector's label and wanted to release their recording as a single in hopes of breaking into the folk rock market, but according to music historian Barney Hoskyns, Spector instead abandoned the group to work on \\"River Deep – Mountain High\\" (1966). Their recording of \\"This Could Be the Night\\" was not commercially available until 1976, when it appeared on a Spector compilation album. Nilsson recorded the song several times, but only a 1967 demo intended for the Monkees has been issued. In 1989, MFQ's Henry Diltz rerecorded the song as a solo artist, and in 1995, Wilson recorded the song for a Nilsson tribute album. Several other musicians have recorded their versions of the song, including David Cassidy, Tatsuro Yamashita, and the Flamin' Groovies. Composition Harry Nilsson in 1967 According to Spector biographer Mick Brown, Nilsson wrote \\"This Could Be the Night\\" as a tribute to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Nilsson brought it to Spector, whose productions Wilson greatly admired. Nilsson and Spector are often listed as the songwriters, including by BMI, the performing rights organization. However, Nilsson biographer Alyn Shipton notes that the song was copyrighted by Nilsson alone on March 30, 1966. It is one of three songs credited jointly to Nilsson and Spector, the other two being \\"Here I Sit\\" and \\"Paradise\\". Shipton describes the lyrics as expressing \\"the heady mixture of hope, desire, and fear experienced when a couple who have been dating for a while are on the point of finally conquering their inhibitions and making love for the first time.\\" Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining \\"Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love … I love that message.\\" Recording MFQ with Spector at Gold Star Studios in 1965 (from left to right): Cyrus Faryar, Jerry Yester, Chip Douglas, Phil Spector, Henry Diltz, Eddie Hoh Hoping to break into the folk rock market, Spector befriended MFQ in 1965. The quartet had recently become a quintet (and shortened their name to MFQ) with the addition of drummer Eddie Hoh and was pursuing a Byrds'-inspired sound. Spector brought the group to Gold Star Studios in Hollywood to record the song. The session date(s) are unknown, but took place between late 1965 and no later than January 19, 1966. According to Brown, \\"Spector's production sounded as if it had been recorded in a school gynamsium—a vibrantly echoing mélange of chiming guitars, bells and exuberant, sunny harmonies\\". Barney Hoskyns described it as \\"pure Wall-of-Sound Beach Boys, light years from the sound Terry Melcher was getting with the Byrds\\". Biographer Mark Ribowsky added that the \\"folk rocker\\" resembled a \\"Wagnerian folk march with Wall of Sound\\". MFQ's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: \\"we could see him in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, for what seemed like hours\\". Release history \\"This Could Be the Night\\" was slated for release as MFQ's first single with the new lineup, but Spector became focused on Tina Turner and \\"River Deep – Mountain High\\" and \\"forgot all about the Modern Folk Quartet\\". Instead it was used as the theme to the rock concert film The Big TNT Show, the 1966 follow-up to the T.A.M.I. Show. The group's Jerry Yester later commented, \\"I never forgave him for the thing with the TNT Show [for which Spector was the musical director and associate producer]. We were supposed to be in it, because we were on his label, for god's sake. But we ended up being the entertainment for everybody while they were setting up for the next band\\". The song was officially released for the first time on the 1976 British compilation album Phil Spector Wall of Sound Vol. 6 – Rare Masters Vol. 2. Several later compilations include it, such as Spector's 1991 career retrospective box set, Back to Mono (1958–1969). Harry Nilsson versions Nilsson recorded a version of the song in the 1960s, which went unreleased. It was lost and forgotten until an acetate appeared in 2008 for sale on eBay. In 1967, Nilsson recorded a solo piano/vocal demo for the Monkees for their consideration in recording the song. Although they never recorded it, Nilsson's demo is included in The RCA Albums Collection, a 2013 box set. In 1989, Nilsson contributed guest vocals on a re-recording of the song by MFQ's Diltz. In the early 1990s, Nilsson recorded a new studio version by himself with additional lyrics, but it remains unreleased. Brian Wilson version In 1973, Melody Maker reported that Wilson remembered most of the song \\"very clearly\\" while playing it on piano for his guests. The newspaper added, \\"Brian obviously got a buzz from singing it with differently harmonized bass lines and new riffs, and it was fascinating to hear how, even though he was only mucking about, the harmonies and rhythms were pure Brian Wilson. No one else could've been playing that piano.\\" Wilson claimed that he had been attempting to get the lyrics from Spector to record a version with the pop duo American Spring, but Spector was \\"strangely reluctant\\" to give away the song. In 1995, Wilson recorded his version–with co-production by Andy Paley–for the Nilsson tribute album For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson.

Biography Fabian was born in Lewisham in 1901. He joined the police in 1921. One biographical account of Fabian credits him with the capture of Robert Augustus Delaney, the first known cat burglar. He was described as \\"small but wiry, carefully dressed and with sharp features and piercing eyes... He was always good‐natured and polite.\\" After retirement from the force in 1949, he worked as crime writer. His work was dramatised in the BBC drama series, 1954-56, Fabian of the Yard, based on his book of the same name (in reference to New Scotland Yard). Each episode ended with an epilogue in which Fabian described the real-life case on which the preceding story had been based. It is written that Fabian took up gardening after his retirement from the Metropolitan Police. He subsequently wrote a somewhat salacious but revelatory account of Soho's vice trade in London After Dark.. On March 12, 1957, he appeared on the game show To Tell the Truth - he was correctly identified by the entire panel, with the exception of Carl Reiner. Fabian also appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 20 February 1956. He passed away in an Epsom, Surrey hospital on 14 June 1978 at the age of 77.

The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress and was not passed. Background Since 2012, federal regulations have required airlines to prominently display the full cost of an airline ticket in their advertisements. The United States Department of Transportation calls this \\"full-fare\\" advertising. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 would declare that it shall not be an unfair or deceptive practice for an air carrier or other covered entity to state the base airfare in an advertisement or solicitation for passenger air transportation if it clearly and separately discloses: (1) the government-imposed taxes and fees for the air transportation, and (2) its total cost. The bill would define \\"base airfare\\" to mean the cost of passenger air transportation, excluding government-imposed taxes and fees. The bill would define \\"covered entity\\" as an air carrier, including an indirect air carrier, foreign carrier, ticket agent, or other person offering to sell tickets for passenger air transportation or a tour or tour component that must be purchased with air transportation. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on April 9, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4156 would require the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to promulgate a rule related to how prices for certain types of air transportation are advertised. Under current policies, DOT requires that advertised prices for air travel reflect the total price per passenger to be paid by customers, including government-imposed taxes and fees. Under H.R. 4156, sellers of air transportation could instead advertise base airfares, provided that advertisements also disclose the amount of additional government-imposed taxes and fees that customers would pay. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4156 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Based on information from DOT we estimate that any costs incurred to complete the proposed rulemaking, which would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, would be insignificant. H.R. 4156 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4156 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 6, 2014 by Rep. Bill Shuster (R, PA-9). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. On July 24, 2014, it was ordered reported alongside House Report 113-554. On July 28, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The Act was received in the Senate where it was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation but was never taken on. It did not pass the 113th Congress (2013-2014). Debate and discussion Passage of the bill was seen as a \\"victory for airlines and their workers' unions.\\" The airlines argued that being forced to include government taxes and fees in their advertised ticket price hides from the public the amount of their ticket that is government mandated forced costs and hurts the airlines' business. Consumer groups argued that the act would accomplish the opposite of its name, enabling bait-and-switch advertising and making comparison shopping on websites almost impossible. Jean Medina of the organization Airlines for America (A4A) argued that the federal government is \\"burying tax hikes in the advertised cost of a ticket, hiding these considerable charges from consumers who pay them.\\" Nicholas Calio of A4A said, \\"It's a misnomer to characterize the current law as a consumer protection rule when it really protects the government, not airline passengers, and it's disingenuous for Washington to hide the ball and not be held responsible for the taxes they impose on air travel.\\" A4A said that as of 2014, $61 of a $300 domestic airfare is taxes. Rep. Bill Shuster, who introduced the bill, said that \\"this bill will allow airlines and travel agents to display the actual costs in a transparent way, in order to allow customers to see the base airfare and government taxes and fees.\\" Yet no rule prevented airlines and travel agents to do so, as long as they also state \\"the entire price to be paid by the customer to the carrier, or agent\\".14 CFR § 399.84 published in 76 FR 79 (Apr. 25, 2011) Shuster thought that \\"it is only fair that consumers know what they are paying for,\\" which is what consumers already did. Opponents of the bill argued that the result would be much more confusing ticket information where it would be difficult to find the full price. Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy division of Consumer Reports, strongly opposed the legislation, with its aviation consultant William McGee saying that \\"the real harm to consumers would come from making it even more difficult to pinpoint the total cost of a ticket when travelers are already dealing with an influx of new airline fees for anything from carrying on bags, selecting seats, or calling reservation center\\". The U.S. Travel Association argued against the bill, with President Roger Dow saying that \\"by no means should we undo the existing rule that enables consumers to see the full bottom-line price when they're ticket shopping.\\" The Washington Post opined \\"wouldn't it be nice if our elected representatives actually represented our interests, instead of the special interests supporting this wrongheaded bill?\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Drip pricing *False advertising *Taxation in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4156 *Congress.gov H.R. 4156 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4156 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4156 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4156 *House Report 113-554 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Airlines of the United States Category:Aviation in the United States ","title":"Transparent Airfares Act of 2014"},{"id":"43393826","text":"Eynali Cable, Tabriz in the background.

A manufacturing unit owned by his yoga trust was accused of violating labour law and medicine mislabelling. The controversy lasted from mid-2005 to March 2006, when the state government of Uttaranchal dropped charges against Ramdev. History In April 2005, Divya Yog Pharmacy manufacturing plant in Haridwar, own by Ramdev, dismissed 115 workers. The workers had been protesting demanding better wages and insurance. Centre of Indian Trade Unions, a trade union associated with the CPI(M), got involved in it on behalf of the workers. On 21 May 2005, a tripartite agreement was signed between the workers, the plant and the district administration. However, the plant did not honour the agreement and implicated several workers in exaggerated police cases. Also in May 2005, Brinda Karat, a CPI(M) leader, visited the site to show solidarity with the workers. She was informed by the agitating workers that human skull and animal parts were allegedly being used by the pharmacy. Karat demanded an investigation. They denied the allegations and said that only sea shells and herbs were used in the preparations. On 22 May 2005, workers began protesting outside the house of district magistrate R.K. Sudhanshu, who had the authority to enforce the agreement. In June 2005, Karat organised protests in Haridwar and Dehra Dun on behalf the dismissed workers. She also met with then Uttaranchal Health Secretary S. K. Dass and demanded that the pharmacy be brought under the Indian labour law as was mass- producing medicines for sale, and the workers be adequately compensated for their labour. In July 2005, the workers began writing letters to various state officials claiming that crushed human skulls were being used in a preparation (Kuliya Bhasm) intended for epilepsy and testicles of the Indian otter was being used a preparation (Yauvanamrit Bati) intended for treatment for sexual weakness. Earlier in May, the workers had obtained samples of the two preparations from the yoga trust's hospital, Brahmakalp Chikitsalay, in Haridwar, along with payment receipts. There were handed over to Principal Secretary (Health) of Uttarachal, Sujit Das, who recommended that in the central government agencies as the state didn't have facilities to test them. The Union Health Ministry passed the samples to Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH). AYUSH found evidence of human and animal DNA in the samples. The final report said that Ayurveda allowed usage to those materials, but the pharmacy was in violation of licensing and labelling laws under Indian Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. On 3 January 2006, Brinda Karat, backed by a letter from Shiv Basant, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry, accused Ramadev of adulteration and labelling violations. Ramadev held a press conference in response and denied the allegations. He claimed that no government agency had approached the pharmacy for tests and that Karat was siding with drug MNCs to defame his firm. He also alleged that the samples may have been tampered with. On 5 January, supporter of Ramdev tried to barge into the CPI(M) office and clashed with the police who tried to stop them. Then Health Minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, said that samples provided by Karat contained human parts but further tests were being conducted. However, many newspapers carried information to the contrary. On 7 January, Karat said that her campaign was about labour laws and consumer rights, she was not against yoga or Ayurveda. In January 2006, several politicians expressed support for Ramdev, among them were Sharad Pawar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Ram Madhav, Prakash Javdekar and Subhas Chakraborty. A Uttaranchal Minister Dhirendra Pratap accused Karat of foul play and demanded an apology. On 22 February 2006, the Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss clarified to the Lok Sabha one of the tests had confirmed human DNA. However other labs had failed to detected the same. He said that a report had been sent to the Uttaranchal government for further investigation. In March 2006, the Uttarakhand government cleared Ramdev of the animal parts in medicine charges. Afterwards, also in March, Karat received a legal notice from B. D. Sethi, a BJP leader from Faridabad, for causing religious disturbances in the country and hurting the religious feelings of pure vegetarians. Later in 2013, Brinda Karat in an interview with the Frontline magazine said that the investigation was not carried out properly and there were cover-ups due to Ramdev's connections to the Chief Minister.

He is remembered primarily for his role in a case Kielley v. Carson which established a limit on the powers granted to assemblies in British colonies. He was born in St. John's and became an assistant surgeon in the Royal Navy in 1814; he was promoted to surgeon the following year. In 1818, he set up practice in St. John's. Kielley married Amelia Jackson in 1822. In 1824, he was acquitted of the charge of assault with intent to commit rape on a woman from Twillingate. Kielly became surgeon for the St. John's jail in 1826. He subsequently returned to service in the Navy but was discharged, having been declared an invalid, and returned to St. John's, where he returned to service as jail surgeon. In 1832, he became a member of the board of health and medical officer for St. John's. Kielley was named district surgeon in 1834. Although a Roman Catholic, he was seen as aligned against the pro-Catholic reformers. Kielley v. Carson In August 1838, Kielley quarrelled with John Kent and threatened him with injury. Kent brought the issue before the assembly, claiming that his parliamentary privilege had been violated. The assembly interviewed witnesses, a warrant was issued by the speaker William Carson and he was arrested by the assembly's sergeant-at-arms. Kielley was brought before the assembly; refusing to apologize, he called Kent \\"a liar and a coward\\". He was sent to jail but was released by the sheriff on a writ of habeas corpus issued by George Lilly, an assistant justice of the Supreme Court. The assembly ordered the arrest of Lilly and the sheriff. At this point, governor Sir Henry Prescott prorogued the assembly. The Supreme Court of Newfoundland found in favour of the assembly in December 1838 but this decision was overturned by the judicial committee of the British Privy Council in January 1843, who found that colonial parliaments did not necessarily have all the privileges associated with the British House of Commons. In 1844, the assembly found that Kielley should be compensated out of public funds for his legal expenses in the matter. Kielley died in St. John's in 1855.

It was a direct competitor to the leading personal publishing program of the time, The Print Shop, by Broderbund. It was released in 1988 for the Apple IIe and MS-DOS. Like The Print Shop, Print Magic lets users create a variety of customized documents, mixing graphics and text, such as: * Greeting cards * Invitations * Award certificates * Meeting announcements * Publicity notices * Scratch pads * Stationery * Banners The program's three disks aren't copy-protected, so users are free to make \\"working copies\\" of them. It employs a Macintosh-like GUI, unusual for software of its time. Most commands and features are accessed via pull-down menus or icons. It can also import clip art from other publishing software, such as The Print Shop and Newsroom. It includes the ability to create custom graphics, such as with a paint program. Print Magic's included clip art was much higher resolution than other packages and scales much better as well. It could also import fonts from Fontrix, a popular font program of the era. The flexibility of the text and graphic layout of documents was one of its most critically acclaimed features, though reviewers noted that sometimes it was troublesome due to the computer's limited resolution. However, it also has a zoom function which allows for pixel- precision placement. Print Magic includes other features, such as the ability to draw various borders on a document, something absent from other contemporary offerings. Reception Print Magic was universally praised for its ease of use, versatility and high-quality graphics, especially compared to contemporary offerings. Duncan Teague of Compute! gave the program a favorable review saying, \\"Print Magic provides solutions to nearly every drawback you've encountered with other printing programs... With its ease of use, intuitive interface, exquisite graphics and text, and superior documentation, Print Magic delivers a fine performance.\\" Peter Staek of Apple2000 said it \\"combines the virtues of versatility and easy operation,\\" and, \\"it is a splendid alternative (or complement) to Print Shop\\". The only criticisms of the program were that it only allowed printing in black and white and that a fairly new ribbon should be used when printing. Legacy Print Magic was later incorporated into another Epyx product, Studio of Greetings. Studio of Greetings used Print Magic as its engine to create a variety of greeting cards for any occasion. Released in 1992, Studio of Greetings was available only for MS-DOS.

It is the fourth spacecraft in the Foton-M series, and the first to use the 34KSM configuration incorporating the equipment module from a Yantar satellite in place of that of a Zenit on earlier missions. Foton-M No.4 was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 18 July 2014, atop a Soyuz-2-1a carrier rocket. The launch was completed successfully, with the satellite separating from its rocket and beginning data transmission to its controllers. However, after four orbits, it ceased responding to commands issued to it from the ground. As a consequence of this, the spacecraft did not perform an orbit-raising maneuver that had been scheduled to occur shortly after orbital insertion. Satellite control was regained on 26 July by which time some of the microgravity experiments had already begun. On 1 August the head of Roskosmos, Oleg Ostapenko, was quoted as saying that the satellite will fly its entire two-month mission as originally planned, despite the cancellation of the orbit-boosting maneuver. However, all of the experiments completed by 27 August, and the Russian space agency decided to return the spacecraft to Earth on 1 September, two weeks earlier than the original 15 September target landing date. Aboard the spacecraft are specimens for research on the biological effects of zero gravity and cosmic radiation. The specimens include geckos, silkworm eggs, dried seeds, fruit flies, and mushrooms. The geckos are part of biology experiments by Russia's Institute of Medico-Biological Problems on the effects of weightlessness on mating. Initial reports after the payload's return indicate that all five of the geckos launched in the experiment had died. Investigation is underway to determine the cause of death. However, the fruit flies did survive the trip and were able to breed and develop successfully. Another experiment aboard the spacecraft is designed to measure the effects of microgravity on semiconductor crystal growth, with the ultimate goal of producing higher-quality crystals for use in electronics.

It was released on 24 March 2002, nearly three years after the first four films. It is based on the book Lieutenant Hornblower by C.S. Forester. Plot In 1802 in Kingston, Jamaica, Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower is imprisoned on a charge of mutiny. On a visit, he explains to his former captain, Commodore Sir Edward Pellew, why he is in prison. In a six months flashback, Hornblower is the 3rd Lieutenant aboard HMS Renown, under the command of the famous Captain James Sawyer, a hero from the Battle of the Nile and one of Admiral Nelson's band of brothers. The other officers are 1st Lieutenant Buckland, the newly arrived 2nd Lieutenant William Bush, and 4th Lieutenant Archie Kennedy. Despite his reputation, Sawyer does not trust his officers and treats them harshly. After a trip to Plymouth, Renown is sent on a mission to Santo Domingo, then undergoing a slave rebellion, in order to deal with Spanish privateers that threaten British trade in the West Indies. On the way, conditions worsen. Sawyer targets Midshipman Wellard especially. Hornblower is placed on a 36-hour watch when he tries to shield Wellard. Later, Sawyer gives the crew an extra ration of rum, which leaves them slow to respond when they suddenly sight two French frigates which threaten to rake Renown. Hornblower manages to frighten them off by ordering the crew to fire an unloaded stern chaser, but Sawyer is again angry at what he sees as an unauthorized act. Wellard is thrashed into unconsciousness and Sawyer orders Hornblower to resume his watch. That night, Sawyer finds Hornblower asleep on watch, which is punishable by death under the Articles of War. Sawyer tells Hornblower, \\"I do believe your life is in my hands.\\" Then he offers the lieutenant a pistol and tells Hornblower to shoot him. Fortunately, Dr. Clive, a Sawyer loyalist, intervenes and leads the captain away. Suspecting his officers are plotting against him, Sawyer extends Hornblower's watch another 36 hours and orders that the other lieutenants report to him every hour. Hornblower secretly meets with Buckland and Kennedy to consider declaring Sawyer unfit for command. Bush joins them. Gunner Hobbs, a loyal, long-time shipmate of Sawyer's, informs the captain that the lieutenants are nowhere to be found. The captain calls out the Marines to search for the officers. Sawyer confronts Lieutenant Kennedy alone and either falls or is pushed into the hold. The captain suffers memory loss and Dr. Clive keeps him sedated to avoid revealing his worsening erratic behaviour. Buckland assumes command. Rumours begin to circulate that someone pushed the captain. Captain Sawyer recovers and lieutenants Bush, Hornblower, and Kennedy are arrested for mutiny. Renown arrives at Santo Domingo, only to find that the Spanish fort sits too high for the ship's guns to be effective. Sawyer insists on remaining and returning fire although it is ineffective. They suffer heavy damage and casualties from the Spanish cannons. Matthews releases the imprisoned lieutenants, and Dr. Clive finally deems Captain Sawyer unfit to command. Lieutenant Buckland takes charge, has the captain locked in his cabin and sails out of cannon range. Back in Kingston, Commodore Pellew asks Hornblower to explain further.

They produce film installations that revisit recent and past material (a score, a piece of music, a film, a photograph or a performance), with a particular focus on a critical history of the photographic and moving image itself. The duo works with performance to create embodiments which are able to conflate different times and they often create illegitimate collaborations – partly fictitious, partly cross-temporal. Their work To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe, In Recognition of their Desperation (2013) is based on the eponymous 1970 score by avant-garde feminist composer Pauline Oliveros, filmed in Funkhaus Nalepastraße, the former GDR Radio studios in Berlin, and featuring performances from the musicians Rachel Aggs, Peaches, Catriona Shaw, Verity Susman, Ginger Brooks Takahashi, and William Wheeler. The work had its premiere exhibition as part of their solo show Patriarchal Poetry at Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe, in Autumn 2013 and was shown at Museum of Modern Art, New York, in a special event with the artists, Oliveros and Gregg Bordowitz in May 2014. In I Want they stage a meeting between punk poet Kathy Acker, artist Sharon Hayes, and transgender- and prison-abolitionist activist Chelsea Manning, who, in 2010, channeled classified information about the war in Iraq to WikiLeaks. The performers in their films are choreographers, dancers, artists and musicians, with whom they are having a long-term conversation about performance, the meaning of visibility since early modernity, the pathologization of bodies, but also about companionship, glamour and resistance.

She made her London debut in 1907 and retired from the stage shortly before her marriage in 1922 to the English wildlife photographer Cherry Kearton. Her 1956 autobiography On Safari recounts their travels together in Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Life and career Kearton was born in Congella, a settlement near Durban in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. She received her first instruction in singing at her convent school in Durban and made her first public appearance at the South African Eisteddfod in Durban when she was 14. She went on to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London and subsequently studied under Charles Santley, Pietro Neri-Baraldi, and Henry Wood. A soprano, she made her London debut on 24 May 1907, at the Empire Day Concert in Queen's Hall. England was to become her home, although she returned to South Africa several times to perform, including a concert tour in 1909. She appeared numerous times in the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts between 1909 and 1915. During the course of her career she appeared in many other concerts and recitals in England and Scotland, including a solo recital at London's Wigmore Hall in November 1918, where she sang 17th-century songs by William Lawes and Thomas Morley and modern settings of Tennyson's poems. The Wigmore performance did not impress Ezra Pound who wrote a scathing review for The New Age: \\"As Morley and Lawes scarcely preserved a trace of their beauties in the path of her assault, I fled before she began singing modern settings of Tennyson.\\" She made a last recital tour to South Africa in 1921 before retiring from the concert stage. She changed her name from Ada Forrest to Ada Cherry Kearton in 1922, upon marrying the wildlife photographer Cherry Kearton (his second marriage) and then \\"devoted her life to her husband and his work\\". The couple had a pet chimpanzee named Mary who lived with them for six years as \\"one of the Kearton family\\". The Keartons were said to have taught Mary to write her name and play three musical instruments. According to the Brisbane Courier-Mail, the chimpanzee would sit and sew with Ada for an hour at a time and accompanied the couple on many of their travels. Ada Kearton's autobiography On Safari, an account of her travels through Africa, Australia and New Zealand with her husband, was published in 1956. On 8 October of that year she appeared as a \\"castaway\\" on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs. Cherry Kearton died in 1940. Ada died in London in 1966 at the age of 88.  Bibliography  Recordings According to the Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Ada Kearton and Annie Visser were the first major South African singers whose recordings included works in Afrikaans.

It was founded in 1990 by rock artist Don Henley to prevent two development projects in Walden Woods. Its mission has since expanded from conservation to research and education on the works of Henry David Thoreau. In 1998 the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods was founded as part of the Project; today its library houses a collection of Thoreau-related resources.Library. Walden Woods Project. Retrieved July 25, 2014.  History  Walden Pond In 1989, two commercial development projects were proposed within Walden Woods at Bear Garden Hill and Brister's Hill. Although 60% of Walden Woods was already protected, the threat of encroaching development in Walden Woods prompted grassroots organizers to oppose the plan, and National Trust for Historic Preservation also listed Walden Woods as one of America's Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places. Don Henley, who was influenced by Thoreau's writings in college, offered to lend his support to the opposition movement. In 1990, Henley founded the Walden Woods Project, which ultimately purchased both the proposed development sites, as well as other sites. The first of these, a 25 acre site on Bear Garden Hill, was bought in January 1991 costing $3.55 million. Another 25 acres at Boiling Spring was purchased for $1.25 million in April 1992, an 18.6 acre site on Brister's hill for $3.5 million in May 1993, 18 acres at Pine Hill in July 1994 for $1.2 million, and 10 acres at Fair Haven Hill for $900,000 in December 1995. The land acquired for preservation totaled 96 acres in the 1990s. Later 41-acres of land along the Sudbury River was acquired as a gift, and further land as well as the Adams House were bought. An interpretive trail was later designed on Brister's hill, featuring quotes from Thoreau and individuals he influenced, and a section explaining ecological succession.Hurley, C., \\"Where Dr. Suess Meets Henry David Thoreau\\", The Boston Globe, March 2, 2014. A quote from Henry David Thoreau at Walden Woods To help cover the cost of the project, Henley organized a series of benefit concerts, which included artists such as Elton John, Aerosmith, Melissa Etheridge, Sting, Jimmy Buffett, John Fogerty, Neil Young, Roger Waters and others. In 1992, Henley initiated the recording of a charity album, Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, released in 1993 to raise funds for the project. It was certified 3× Platinum in the United States by the RIAA on June 27, 1994. He also donated part of the proceeds from the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over album and tour. Through these and various other fund-raising efforts, which included T-shirt sales and a book Heaven Is Under Our Feet, $15 million were raised by 1996, and $22 million were eventually raised in total. The organization pledged to find a new location for the thwarted housing development planned. They later paid for the appraisal and environmental assessment on a 12-acre site in West Concord, which in 2013 was transferred to the Concord Housing Development Corporation.Lefferts, J.F., Walden Woods Project delivers on affordable housing pledge, The Boston Globe, February 21, 2013. The project's headquarters were moved from Boston to Lincoln, MA, in 1997, and in 1998 the Thoreau Institute officially opened.

It was one of the few trolley companies to remain independent of the Connecticut Company consolidation of transit lines throughout the state. Electric trolley service between Danbury and Bethel began in 1887. The streetcar line connected to the Danbury and Harlem Traction Company at the Fairgrounds, but no service was provided and the line was abandoned by 1910. The Danbury and Bethel Street Railway faced its first financial difficulties in 1914 as ridership declined with the closure of local factories. The construction of an aborted extension to Bridgeport had nearly exhausted the railway's cash reserves. The company was purchased by J. Moss Ives in 1918 with the intention of bringing the operation back to profitability. The first buses were ordered and put into operation in 1912 between Main Street and Lake Avenue in Danbury. Ives reorganized as the Danbury and Bethel Traction Company in 1925. When the proposal to replace all remaining streetcar lines with bus operation was announced, the trolley motormen all went on strike in November 1926. The work stoppage did not affect the transition, and by the end of 1926 all streetcar operation had been abandoned, making it the first line in Connecticut to completely convert to bus operation. Bus Transit Operations (1927-1965) The Danbury Power and Transportation Company succeeded Danbury and Bethel Traction Company and continued to operate local bus transit service around the city of Danbury. The company was headed by A. William Sperry, founder of Sperry Engineering. Streamlined GMC transit buses began to appear between 1945 and 1948. William T. Sperry took over operations from his father in 1950. A number of fare increases through the 1950s were proposed to keep pace with rising costs. The bus operation grew into a regional system by the 1950s. Routes to Brewster, Bridgeport, and Norwalk were operated by subsidiary Intercity Coach and Danbury Bus Company. Sperry also operated White Lines in Bridgeport, as well as local services in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Levittown, New York. Sperry also provided school bus services in Danbury and the surrounding communities through subsidiary County Bus Service. In September 1964, Danbury Power and Transportation, Danbury Bus, and Intercity Coach all suspended operation when their liability insurance had expired due to non-payment. An interim operator from New Haven kept the local service running in the meantime. A month after the transit service was suspended, the banks had seized County Bus Service which disrupted school bus service throughout the region. The fleet was repossessed and new operators took over the following week. From Private to Public Operation (1965-1979) The local transit franchises were acquired by Candlewood Bus Company in 1965. Operation then passed to ABC Bus Company for a few months until all local bus service was suspended in 1967. The Danbury-Bethel Transit District was formed in 1972 to restore local bus transit service to Danbury and Bethel. Service began in 1973, with Candlewood Valley Bus Company operating the service under contract. The Chieppo Bus Co. of New Haven provided infrequent bus service between Danbury and Bridgeport during the 1960s and 1970s before going out of business; since the early 1980s, there has been no direct bus service between Danbury and Bridgeport. In 1979, New Milford was added to the transit district. The system was soon rebranded and renamed Housatonic Area Regional Transit (HART).

This is the same vector that transmits the SFTS virus, and the newly discovered Bhanja and Heartland virus. Lone Star virus shares the same vector as these viruses and has many characteristics of them, it shares less than sixty-one percent of its amino acid identity with them. Though the virus has never been a cause of illness in humans, it has the ability to infect both human and monkey cells, and its effects are seen, in both cell lines, 72 hours after contact. It was first discovered and studied by the Center for Zoonoses Research, at the University of Illinois, in 1966. The virus was taken from a Lone Star Tick, which had been removed from a woodchuck in the Land Between the Lakes region of Western Kentucky. Characteristics Lone Star virus's genome consist of negative, single-stranded RNA. It is in the Bunyaviridae family of viruses. Its genus is the Phlebovirus and its species name is Lone Star virus. It has been proven to produce titers in human and monkey cells seventy-two hours after inoculation. Although it was discovered in 1967, it has never been genetically characterized. Interest has recently increased in it due to the emergence of STARI, or Southern Tick-borne Rash Illness, an unknown disease which is also associated with Amblyomma americanum. It is the hope of the scientific community that researching Lone Star virus can give clues to the etiology of STARI. They are also curious as to whether LSV virus could be found in patients who have STARI. Finding a link between the two will help them to understand both of these viruses on a greater level. The viruses size is between 90 and 100 micrometers Transmission There has not been any documented case of Lone Star virus causing illness in a human. It is found to be present in the Lone Star Tick. This tick used to exist mainly in the South- Central United States, however it has increased in both range and abundance over the past twenty years, to now exist along most of the Southern states and the Eastern Coast of the United States. This increase in number will cause more humans to come in contact with Lone Star ticks, and could possible lead to a human being affected by the virus. Signs and symptoms The virus is shown to have a cytopathic effect on both human (HeLa) and monkey (vero) cells. As part of the minimal research that has been done, death occurred in mice that were infected with the virus. Risk factors No human cases have been found thus far, however evidence points to the fact that it does have pathogenic effects in humans. This means this disease could likely be something that affects humans in the future, or has had an effect, but has not been documented, or traced back to this source. it has a Biosafety level of 2. Research After the virus was isolated from the A. americanum nymph, it was inoculated into many test animals including: newborn and full-grown mice, woodchucks, raccoons, as well as chicken and duck eggs. The virus was most pathogenic to the newborn mice, causing death in many of them. In the full grown mice, their reaction to the virus was determined by how the virus was inoculated in them. Mice who received the virus intraperitoneally, showed no reaction or symptoms to the virus. However about seventy-five percent of mice who were inoculated in their cerebrum showed sickness or even death, due to the virus. One out of the six woodchucks studied showed signs of being infected while the others had no response to the inoculation. Only raccoons developed antibodies against the virus, and did not show any other signs of being exposed. The chicken and duck eggs were not affected in any way.

He won one minor race as a two-year-old but was highly regarded by his connections and was considered a leading contender for the following year's Epsom Derby. His three-year-old campaign was severely restricted by injury, but he won two of his three races, including the Great Voltigeur Stakes. At four, he was beaten in his first two races before recording an impressive seven-length win in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. He added a win in the Aston Park Stakes in 2015 before his racing career was ended by injury. Apart from his wins, he finished second in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, third in the International Stakes and fourth in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Background Telescope is a bay horse with a large white star bred in Ireland by the Barronstown Stud. He was sired by Galileo the winner of the 2001 Derby who went on to become an outstanding breeding stallion, winning the title of champion sire on five occasions. Galileo's other progeny include Rip Van Winkle, Nathaniel, Cape Blanco, New Approach and Frankel. His dam, Velouette was an unraced daughter of the Lowther Stakes winner Velvet Moon, a mare whose other progeny included Moon Ballad. Velvet Moon was a half-sister of Central Park who won the Derby Italiano and finished second in the Melbourne Cup and was related to the Prix Royal Oak winner Braashee. Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= On his first racecourse appearance, Telescope, ridden by Richard Mullen, started the 4/1 favourite for a seventeen-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse. He was restrained towards the back of the field before making progress in the final quarter mile but was beaten a short head by Snow King after Mullen dropped his whip 50 yards from the finish. Nineteen days later he started 8/13 favourite against eight opponents in a maiden race over the Rowley mile at Newmarket in which he was ridden by Richard Hughes. As on his debut, he pulled hard against his jockey's attempts to restrain him before moving up to take the lead a furlong from the finish. He won comfortably by two and a quarter lengths from Elkaayed without Hughes having to use his whip. =2013: three-year-old season= Telescope was regarded as a leading contender for the 2013 Epsom Derby but suffered from a series of leg injuries and did not contest the race. He missed an intended run in the Dante Stakes and was withdrawn from the Derby field after performing unimpressively in a racecourse gallop at Lingfield Park Racecourse. He made a belated seasonal debut on 18 July in a minor race over ten furlongs at Leicester Racecourse in which he was ridden by Ryan Moore and started the 1/2 favourite against two opponents. The colt led in the early stages, before being headed by Centurius, but regained the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away to win by twenty-four lengths. On 10 August, Telescope was matched against older horses for the first time when he started 4/9 favourite for the Group Three Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock Park Racecourse. Telescope and Ryan Moore tracked the leaders before making a challenge in the straight but was beaten a length by the four-year-old David Livingston with Noble Mission a head away in third place. In the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse eleven days later, Telescope started 5/4 favourite against six opponents including the Gordon Stakes winner Cap o'Rushes and the Aidan O'Brien-trained Foundry. The colt tracked the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Foundry with the Godolphin colt Secret Number in third. After the race, Telescope was made the ante-post favourite for the St Leger Stakes but was withdrawn from the race after doubts were expressed about his ability to stay the distance. He missed an alternative engagement in the Champion Stakes and did not race again in 2013. =2014: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Telescope contested the Group Three Gordon Richards Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 25 April in which he finished second, proving no match for Noble Mission, who won by nine lengths. He faced Noble Mission again in the Huxley Stakes over a similar distance at Chester Racecourse on 8 May, and was beaten two and a quarter lengths by the Lady Cecil-trained five-year-old, who was conceding three pounds. On 21 June at Royal Ascot, Telescope was moved back up in distance for the Group Two Hardwicke Stakes over one and a half miles. After racing just behind the leaders Telescope took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and went clear of his opponents to win impressively by seven lengths from his stable companion Hillstar. Despite never having previously competed at Group One level, Telescope started 5/2 favourite for Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same course and distance as the Hardwicke on 26 July. He raced in third palace before moving forward to challenge for the lead in the straight. He got the better of a protracted struggle with the five-year-old Mukhadram but was unable to hold the late run of the filly Taghrooda and finished second, three lengths behind the winner. Highclere's leader Harry Herbert said \\"It went according to plan... Our horse has run a cracking race... There's plenty to look forward to\\". On 20 August Telescope was brought back in distance to face the Derby winner Australia as well as Mukhadram and the Prix du Jockey Club winner The Grey Gatsby in the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York. He tracked the leaders in fourth place before moving forward to challenge for the lead in the straight, but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third, beaten two lengths and two and a quarter lengths by Australia and The Grey Gatsby. On 1 November, Telescope started the 8/5 favourite for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park. After racing just behind the leaders he moved up on the inside on the final turn and took a narrow advantage early in the straight. He was overtaken in the closing stages and finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Main Sequence, Flintshire and Twilight Eclipse. Stoute commented \\"He's run a good race, but the race wasn't really run to suit him. He needs to be able to do it one long progression.

The bill would require an independent assessment of how well the TWIC program improves security and reduces risks at the facilities and vessels it is responsible for. The evaluation would include a cost-benefit analysis and information on alternate technologies that could be used. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background A sample Transportation Worker Identification Credential. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program is a Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Coast Guard initiative in the United States. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential to maritime workers requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities, outer continental shelf facilities, and vessels regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or MTSA, and all U.S. Coast Guard credentialed merchant mariners. As of May 2014, there were 2,999,058 people enrolled in the program. Critics assert that the program has cost over $420 million and has little to show for it.http://www.marinelink.com/news/maritime-security-useless344893.aspx A 2013 GAO report found the TWIC card reader pilot program results to be unreliable and questioned \\"the program's premise and effectiveness in enhancing security.\\" Rep. John Mica (R-FL) has called them \\"at best no more useful than library cards.http://www.foleyservices.com/news/twic-about-as-useful-as-a- library-card-claims-congressman/ Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act would direct the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit to Congress and the Comptroller General (GAO) a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the transportation security card program at enhancing security or reducing security risks for maritime facilities and vessels. The bill would direct the Secretary to issue a corrective action plan based on the assessment that responds to the findings of a cost-benefit analysis of the program and enhances security or reduces security risk for such facilities and vessels. The bill would direct the Comptroller General, within 120 days after the Secretary issues the corrective action plan, to: (1) review the extent to which the submissions implement certain recommendations issued by the Comptroller General, and (2) inform Congress as to the responsiveness of the submission. The bill would prohibit the Secretary from issuing a final rule requiring the use of transportation security card readers until: (1) the Comptroller General informs Congress that the submission is substantially responsive to the GAO recommendations, and (2) the Secretary issues an updated list of transportation security card readers that are compatible with active transportation security cards. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3202 would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess the effectiveness of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. That program was established under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide a biometric security credential for personnel who require unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels and to all mariners who hold credentials issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. Based on the findings of the proposed assessment, H.R. 3202 would direct the Secretary to identify and implement corrective actions necessary to improve the effectiveness of the TWIC program and require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to the Congress on the status of those efforts. Finally, H.R. 3202 would specify conditions that would pertain to certain rulemakings related to the TWIC program. Based on information from the Coast Guard and GAO, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3202 would cost about $1.5 million in 2015, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. That estimate is based on the historical cost of studies and analyses undertaken by those agencies that are similar in scope to those envisioned under the bill. Enacting H.R. 3202 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3202 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 27, 2013 by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D, TX-18). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. On July 17, 2014 it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-528. On July 28, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 456 to pass the bill 400-0.

Disclosures Tribunal  In 2017, he was appointed sole member of the Disclosures Tribunal investigation into allegations of Garda Síochána malpractice. He published two substantive reports as chair of the Tribunal. The portion of the inquiry presided over by Charleton ran from February 2017 until October 2018. In his findings from the inquiry, he found that a Garda sergeant, Maurice McCabe, had been subject to a smear campaign by the Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan and a Garda press officer, but not from subsequent Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan and other Gardaí. He was also critical of the Child and Family Agency in handling claims of rape. In his concluding remarks on his findings, he criticised the Gardaí and the Child and Family Agency for not having organisational mentalities of learning from their errors. He was particularly critical of the credibility of evidence given by several senior members of the police force. Drew Harris, O'Sullivan's successor as commissioner, said on its publication that the report was \\"difficult reading for the organisation\\" and the Gardaí would move to have \\"an open and inclusive culture\\". Subsequently, he criticised the manner in which tribunals of inquiry are conducted in Ireland. He suggested that instead of being run in a format akin to criminal trials, the main aspect of the inquiry should be directed from the tribunal itself.  Personal life  He is married to Fiona Daly. He has three children. He was a founder of the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir and a member of the board of the Irish Baroque Orchestra.

Desire to leave the United States  According to a Gallup poll from January 2019, 40 percent of women under the age of 30 would like to leave the United States.  Rankings  =Gender equality ranking= As of 2017, the United States is ranked 49th of 142 applicable countries in gender equality on the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index.  Statistics  =Education= As of 2014, women in the United States earn more post- secondary (college and graduate school) degrees than men do. =Marriage= As of 2013, the most recent year for which statistics are available, average age at first marriage in the United States is 27 for women and 29 for men. =Workforce= As of 2014, women are 46.5% of the total United States workforce. Sex discrimination has been outlawed in non-ministerial employment in the United States since 1964 nationwide; however, under a judicially created doctrine called the \\"ministerial exemption,\\" religious organizations are immune from sex discrimination suits brought by \\"ministerial employees,\\" a category that includes such religious roles as priests, imams or kosher supervisors. A woman's median salary in the United States has increased over time, although as of 2014 it is only 77% of man's median salary, a phenomenon often referred to as the Gender Pay Gap. (A woman's average salary is reported as 84% of a man's average salary.) Whether this is due to discrimination is very hotly disputed, while economists and sociologists have provided evidence both supporting and debunking this assertion.  Violence  Violence against women has been recognized as a public health concern in the United States. Culture in the country has promoted the trivialization women-directed violence, with media in the United States creating the appearance of violence against women unimportant to the public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Justice reports that about 1 in every 4 women suffer from at least one physical assault experience from a partner during adulthood.The Violence Against Women Act of 2005, Summary of Provisions.

He was the Senior Unofficial Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the first Chairman of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Background Ryrie was born in Stornoway, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Scotland in 1827 or 1829. He was the son of William Ryrie, Lt., a merchant navy captain who commanded the big tea clippers Cairngorm and Flying Spur for the Jardine, Matheson & Co., the then-largest trading firm in the East. His older brother, John Ryrie was also captain of the Cairngorm. His brother, Alexander, drowned in 1855, when his ship, Jardine Matheson's Audax, was lost with all hands during a typhoon en route from Shanghai to Hong Kong. He had also a sister named Ida. Business career Ryrie arrived in China in 1851, entering into business by joining Turner & Co., a general agent firm and opium merchant founded by Robert Turner in Canton, of which he became partner in 1860 and later senior partner. He was also auditor of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and investor and director of Dr. Patrick Manson's Dairy Farm Company. With Alexander Finlay Smith, who had previously worked for Scotland's Highland Railway, they co-founded the High Level Tramway Company in 1885 and began to build the Peak Tram running from Garden Road to Victoria Gap. Ryrie was also Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on three occasions, in 1867–68, 1871–72 and 1886–87. In 1888, Ryrie was a Director of the Hong Kong, Canton & Macao Steamboat Company Legislative unofficial As the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Ryrie was appointed as unofficial member of the Legislative Council in 1867, and went on leave in 1868. James Banks Taylor held his seat until he returned as Senior Unofficial Member in 1870. Ryrie was the first to break the traditional five years term as a senior member on the council, and he continued serving for a quarter of a century until his death in office in 1892. He opposed Governor John Pope Hennessy's prison reform of abolishing public flogging and branding. On 7 October 1878, he held a public meeting at the City Hall where he raised objection to the Governor and proposed to increase the penalty for the violation of order and peace, the crime rate having risen after the abolition. Public life Although he was opposed to legalising gambling, Ryrie was founding Chairman of the Hong Kong Jockey Club which was established in 1884. Under Ryrie's chairmanship the new club overcame a damaging 1885 flood and the loss of its surplus in 1891 due to bank failure, providing a stabilising presence. He was the inaugural Chieftain of the St. Andrew's Society, an elite club for Scotsmen. He was also a sporting enthusiast. He introduced rabbits from England to Stonecutters' Island for hunting but they failed to reproduce. Family and death Ryrie married Elizabeth Ann Mary at St. John's Cathedral, Hong Kong on 16 December 1863. In 1866, his wife had a daughter, Muriel, but both died shortly after. He never remarried but it was rumoured that he installed a secret Chinese mistress. He built himself a mansion on the Peak called \\"Craig Ryrie\\". Ryrie's health failed rapidly during his last days, falling unconscious and dying at 1.30am on 22 February, aged 63. The funeral took place at the Hong Kong Cemetery, Happy Valley, the same afternoon and was attended by many local leaders.

There is a controversy around the true identity and objective of the culprits behind the bombings, and the issue remains unresolved. Two activists in the Iraqi Zionist underground were found guilty by an Iraqi court for a number of the bombings, and were sentenced to death. Another was sentenced to life imprisonment and seventeen more were given long prison sentences.Morris & Black, 1992, p. 91 The allegations against Israeli agents had \\"wide consensus\\" amongst Iraqi Jews in Israel. Many of the Iraqi Jews in Israel who lived in poor conditions blamed their ills and misfortunes on the Israeli Zionist emissaries or Iraqi Zionist underground movement. The theory that \\"certain Jews\\" carried out the attacks \\"in order to focus the attention of the Israel Government on the plight of the Jews\\" was viewed as \\"more plausible than most\\" by the British Foreign Office. Telegrams between the Mossad agents in Baghdad and their superiors in Tel Aviv give the impression that neither group knew who was responsible for the attack. Israeli involvement has been consistently denied by the Israeli government, including by a Mossad-led internal inquiry, even following the 2005 admission of the Lavon affair.Cohen, p111 Those who assign responsibility for the bombings to an Israeli or Iraqi Zionist underground movement suggest the motive was to encourage Iraqi Jews to immigrate to Israel, as part of the ongoing Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. Those historians who have raised questions regarding the guilt of the convicted Iraqi Zionist agents with respect to the bombings note that by 13 January 1951, nearly 86,000 Jews had already registered to immigrate, and 23,000 had already left for Israel, that the British who were closely monitoring the Jewish street did not even mention the bombs of April and June 1950, nor were they mentioned in the Iraqi trials, meaning these were minor events. They have raised other possible culprits such as a nationalist Iraqi Christian army officer, and those who have raised doubt regarding Israeli involvement claimed that it is highly unlikely the Israelis would have taken such measures to accelerate the Jewish evacuation given that they were already struggling to cope with the existing level of Jewish immigration.  Background Before the exodus of Jews to Israel, there were about 140,000 Iraqi Jews. Most lived in Baghdad, of which Jews made up a sixth of the city's population. High Jewish populations also existed in the towns of Basra and Mosul. Iraqi Jews constitute one of the world's oldest and most historically significant Jewish communities. By 1936, there was an increased sense of insecurity among the Jews of Iraq. In 1941 after the government of pro-Nazi Rashid Ali was defeated, his soldiers and policemen, aided by the Arab mob, started the Farhud (\\"violent dispossession\\").The terror behind Iraq's Jewish exodus Julia Magnet (The Telegraph, 16 April 2003) A government commission later reported that at least 180 Jews had been killed and 240 wounded, 586 Jewish businesses pillaged, and 99 Jewish homes burned. Jewish sources claimed much higher casualties. In the summer of 1948, following the declaration of the State of Israel, the Iraqi government declared Zionism a capital offense and fired Jews in government positions. In his autobiography, Sasson Somekh, a Baghdadi Jew, wrote: > Emigration until 1946 or 1947 was infrequent, despite the growing feeling > among Iraqi Jews that their days in the Land of the Two Rivers were > numbered. By the time war broke out in Palestine in 1948, many civil > servants had been dismissed from their governmental jobs. Commerce had > declined considerably, and the memory of the Farhud, which had meanwhile > faded, returned.Baghdad, Yesterday:The Making of an Arab Jew, Sasson Somekh, > Ibis, 2003, p. 150 At this time, he writes, \\"hundreds of Jews... were sentenced by military courts to long prison sentences for Zionist and Communist activity, both real and imagined. Some of the Baghdadi Jews who supported the Zionist movement began to steal across the border to Iran, from where they were flown to Israel.\\"Baghdad, Yesterday:The Making of an Arab Jew, Sasson Somekh, Ibis, 2003, p. 152 Elie Kedourie writes that after the 1948 show trial of Shafiq Ades, a respected Jewish businessman, who was publicly hanged in Basra, Iraq Jews realized they were no longer under the protection of the law and there was little difference between the mob and Iraqi court justice.The terror behind Iraq's Jewish exodus Julia Magnet (The Telegraph, 16 April 2003) The immigration to Israel was banned Since 1948,Gat 2013 , p. 55 and by 1949, the Iraqi Zionist underground was smuggling Iraqi Jews out of the country at the rate of 1,000 a month.R. S. Simon, S. Reguer, M. Laskier, The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times (Columbia University Press, 2003), p. 365 In March 1950, Iraq passed a law which temporarily allowed immigration to Israel, limited to one year only, and stripping Jews who emigrated of their Iraqi citizenship.Gat, 2013, p. 183 The law was motivated by economic considerations (the property of departing Jews reverted to the state treasury) and a sense that Jews were a potentially troublesome minority that the country would be better off without. At first, few would register, as the Zionist movement suggested they not do so until property issues had been clarified. After mounting pressure from both Jews and the Government, the movement relented and agreed to registrations. Israel was initially reluctant to absorb so many immigrants, (Hillel, 1987) but in March 1951 organized Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, an airlift to Israel, and sent in emissaries to encourage Jews to leave. In April 1950, an activist of Mossad LeAliyah Bet, Shlomo Hillel, using the alias Richard Armstrong, flew from Amsterdam to Baghdad as a representative of the American charter company Near East Air Transport, to organize an airlift of Iraq Jews to Israel via Cyprus. Earlier, Hillel had trained Zionist militants in Baghdad under the alias Fuad Salah. Near East Air Transport was owned by the Jewish Agency. The first flight of \\"Near east airlines\\" with immigrating Iraqi Jews arrived at Israel on 20 May 1950, when 46000 Jews already registered under the De-naturalization law. Israel could not cope with so many immigrants and limited the rate of the flights from Iraq. by early January 1951, the number of Jews who registered to leave was up to 86,000, only about 23,000 of whom had left. According to Adam Shatz, the Mossad had been promoting Jewish emigration since 1941 and used stories of Jewish mistreatment to encourage the Jews to leave. Nuri al-Said had warned the Jewish community of Baghdad to accelerate their flights out of the country, otherwise, he would take the Jews to the Borders himself. Nuri al-Said's threats encouraged Iraqi officials to abuse the departing Jews before they boarded the planes and to destroy their baggage.Glitzenstein, 2004, p. 206 Bombing incidents  According to the Baghdad police who gave evidence at the trial, the weapon used was a British-made World War II hand grenade \\"No. 36\\".Quoted in Gat, 1997, \\"it was clear that in each case a hand- grenade of high-explosive type No. 36 was used: these are available in Iraq only to the armed forces.\\" Between April 1950.-June 1951 several explosions had occurred in Baghdad:Gat, 2013, p. 172Ian Black, 1991, p. 91 * In April, 1950, a bomb was thrown into El-Dar El-Bayda Coffee shop in Baghdad. Four Jews were injured in the blast. * On 10 May 1950, a grenade was thrown at Beit-Lawi Automobile company building, a company with Jewish ownership. * On 3 June 1950, a grenade exploded in El-Batawin, then a Jewish area of Baghdad, with no casualties. * On 14 January 1951, a grenade damaged a high-voltage cable outside Masouda Shem-Tov Synagogue. Three, or four Jews were killed, including a 12-year-old boy, and ten were wounded. * On 14 March 1951, a bomb went off in the American Cultural Center and Library wounding some of the Jewish intellectuals using the facilities. * On 5 June 1951, a bomb went off next to the Jewish Stanley Sashua car dealership on El Rasjid Street. Nobody was injured. * On 19 March 1951, the US legation's information office was attacked.Gat, 2013, p. 179 * In May 1951, a Jewish home was attacked.Black and Morris, 1992, p. 91 Trial The pro-Western Iraqi government of Faisal II and Nuri al-Said prosecuted the alleged Jewish perpetrators in court, in a trial which began in October 1951. Two confirmed activists in the Zionist underground, Shalom Salah Shalom, a 19-year-old weapons expert, and Yosef Ibrahim Basri, a lawyer active in collecting intelligence material, were executed after being convicted of the bombings. Whilst their involvement in the underground movement and holdings of weapons caches were not disputed, both denied involvement in the bombings.One of the defendants admitted responsibility under torture, although he rescinded this admission in court. Salah's testimony under torture indirectly allowed the Iraqi police to find large weapons caches of the Zionist underground in three synagogues (Mas'uda Shemtov, Hakham Haskal and Meir Tuweik) and in private homes, including 436 hand-grenades, 33 machine-guns, 97 machine-gun cartridges, 186 pistols. Shlomo Hillel, also once a member of the Iraqi Zionist underground, noted that the last words of the executed defendants were \\"Long live the State of Israel\\". The British Foreign Office noted in a file note \\"Trial of Jews at Baghdad, 20 December 1951\\" that they had \\"no reason to suppose that the trials were conducted in anything but a normal manner\\". Baghdad police officers who gave evidence at the trial appear to have been convinced that the crimes were committed by Jewish agents, claiming that \\"anyone studying the affair closely will see that the perpetrator did not intend to cause loss of life among the Jews\\" and that each grenade was \\"thrown in non-central locations and there was no intention to kill or injure a certain person\\". Historian Esther Meir- Glitzenstein, in her book, Zionism in an Arab Country: Jews in Iraq in the 1940s states that the charges in the Iraqi trial were \\"groundless for several reasons,\\" because many thousands of Iraqi Jews had already registered to leave by the time of the later bombings, and the charges related only to these later bombings. Responsibility for the bombings There has been debate over whether the bombs were in fact planted by the Mossad or the Iraqi Zionist underground in order to encourage Iraqi Jews to immigrate to the newly created state of Israel or whether they were the work of Arab anti-Jewish extremists in Iraq. The issue has been the subject of lawsuits and inquiries in Israel. The true identity and objective of the culprits behind the bombings has been the subject of controversy. A secret Israeli inquiry in 1960 found no evidence that they were ordered by Israel or any motive that would have explained the attack, though it did find out that most of the witnesses believed that Jews had been responsible for the bombings.Morris and Black, p. 93; Gat, p. 186–187. The issue remains unresolved: Iraqi activists still regularly charge that Israel used violence to engineer the exodus, while Israeli officials of the time vehemently deny it.Morris and Black; Gat; passim Historian Moshe Gat reports that \\"the belief that the bombs had been thrown by Zionist agents was shared by those Iraqi Jews who had just reached Israel\\".Gat, p. 177 Sociologist Phillip Mendes backs Gat's claims, and further attributes the allegations to have been influenced and distorted by feelings of discrimination. =Claims for Israeli or Iraqi Zionist involvement= Historian Abbas Shiblak, Iraqi Jew Naeim Giladi and CIA agent Wilbur Crane Eveland have argued that Jews were involved in the bombings. In 1949, Zionist emissary Yudka Rabinowitz complained that the complacency of the Iraqi Jews was \\"hampering our existence\\" and proposed to the Mossad \\"throwing several hand-grenades for intimidation into cafes with a largely Jewish clientele, as well as leaflets threatening the Jews and demanding their expulsion from Berman\\", using the code name for Iraq., quoting from correspondence in the Haganah Archives: \\"One of the Zionist emissaries Yudka Rabinowitz complained in April 1949 that \\"the complacency among the Jews of Berman is unbelievable\\" .. He therefore proposed to the Mossad 'throwing several hand-grenades for intimidation into cafes with a largely Jewish clientele, as well as leaflets threatening the Jews and demanding their expulsion from Berman. This is simple and easy to carry out because of the size of the place. In my opinion there is no better way of persuading the Jews of Berman to become Jews than such action.'\\" The Mossad forbade him to conduct negotiations about or carry out any acts of terror, an order which he reported that he had \\"confirmed and accepted\\". According to Moshe Gat, as well as Meir-Glitzenstein, Samuel Klausner, Rayyan Al-Shawaf and Yehouda Shenhav, there is \\"wide consensus among Iraqi Jews that the emissaries threw the bombs in order to hasten the Jews' departure from Iraq\\".: \\"The belief that the bombs had been thrown by Zionist agents was shared by those Iraqi Jews who had just reached Israel. These Jews were convinced that the bombs had been thrown in order to expedite their departure. If the incidents had not occurred they would have been able to remain safe and sound in their comfortable homes in Baghdad. The difficulties they encountered in Israel early in 1952 were the direct consequence of this act. When the immigrants learned of the hanging of the two Jews sentenced for throwing the bombs, many reacted by saying that this was divine retribution against the underground movement which had brought them to Israel... (Footnote) There is wide consensus among Iraqi Jews that the emissaries threw the bombs in order to hasten the Jews' departure from Iraq\\" Shenhav noted an Israeli Foreign Ministry memo which stated that Iraqi Jews reacted to the hangings of Salah and Basri with the attitude: \\"That is God's revenge on the movement that brought us to such depths.\\" The British Embassy in Baghdad assessed that the bombings were carried out by Zionist activists trying to highlight the danger to Iraqi Jews, in order influence the State of Israel to accelerate the pace of Jewish emigration. Another possible explanation offered by the embassy was that bombs were meant to change the minds of well-off Jews who wished to stay in Iraq.British Embassy in Baghdad, FO371, EQ1571, Baghdad to FO, 27 June 1951, \\"one theory which is more plausible than most is that certain Jews have endeavoured, by throwing bombs at certain buildings, to focus the attention of the Israel Government on the plight of the Jews in Iraq so that they would keep the airlift moving quickly, and, possibly as a second object, to induce those well-to-do Jews who had decided to remain in Iraq to change their mind and emigrate to Israel.\\" In a 1954 operation by Israeli military intelligence, known as the Lavon Affair after the defence minister Pinchas Lavon, a group of Zionist Egyptian Jews attempted to plant bombs in a US Information Service library, and in a number of American targets in Cairo and Alexandria. According to Teveth, they were hoping that the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communists, 'unspecified malcontents' or 'local nationalists' would be blamed for their actionsS. Teveth, Ben-Gurion's spy: the story of the political scandal that shaped modern Israel. Columbia University Press, 1996, , p. 81. and this would undermine Western confidence in the existing Egyptian regime by generating public insecurity and actions to bring about arrests, demonstrations, and acts of revenge, while totally concealing the Israeli factor. The operation failed, the perpetrators were arrested by Egyptian police and brought to justice, two were sentenced to death, several to long term imprisonment. The Israeli government has denied any link to the Baghdad bombings, and blamed Iraqi nationalists for the attacks on the Iraqi Jews. However, according to Shalom Cohen, when the Lavon affair broke in Israel, Lavon remarked, \\"This method of operating was not invented for Egypt. It was tried before in Iraq.\\" The Iraqi Jewish anti-Zionist\\"Anti-Zionist writer Naeim Giladi dies\\" Queens Chronicle. 11 March 2010.Zwire.com, Retrieved 2010-10-20. author Naeim Giladi maintains that the bombings were \\"perpetrated by Zionist agents in order to cause fear amongst the Jews, and so promote their exodus to Israel.\\" This theory is shared by Uri Avnery, who wrote in My friend, the enemy that \\"After the disclosure of the Lavon Affair... the Baghdad affair became more plausible\\" and Marion Wolfsohn. Palestinian historian Abbas Shiblak believes that the attacks were committed by Zionist activists and that the attacks were the pre-eminent reason for the subsequent exodus of Iraqi Jews to Israel. Shiblak also argues that the attacks were an attempt to sour Iraq-American relations, saying \\"The March 1951 attack on the US Information Centre was probably an attempt to portray the Iraqis as anti-American and to gain more support for the Zionist cause in the United States\\". According to Gat, Avnery wrote \\"without checking the facts...Marion Woolfson ... goes on to distort the dates of the explosions and the number of registrees, in order to prove her contention...Avnery’s article and Marion Woolfson’s book served as the basis for the arguments of the Palestinian author Abbas Shiblak\\". Giladi claims that it is also supported by Wilbur Crane Eveland, a former senior officer in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in his book Ropes of Sand. According to Eveland, whose information was presumably based on the Iraqi official investigation, which was shared with the US embassy, \\"In an attempt to portray the Iraqis as anti-American and to terrorize the Jews, the Zionists planted bombs in the U.S. Information Service library and in the synagogues. Soon leaflets began to appear urging Jews to flee to Israel... most of the world believed reports that Arab terrorism had motivated the flight of the Iraqi Jews whom the Zionists had 'rescued' really just in order to increase Israel’s Jewish population.\\" Shimon Mendes wrote in Ha'aretz that: \\"Someone had to act, and he took the appropriate action at the right time. For only an act like the explosions would have brought them to Israel. Anyone who understood politics and developments in Israel was long aware of that.\\" Yehuda Tajar, who spent ten years in Iraqi prison for his alleged involvement in the bombings, was interviewed in Arthur Neslen's 2006 book \\"Occupied Minds\\". According to Tajar, the widow of one of the Jewish activists, Yosef Beit- Halahmi, implied he had organized attacks after his colleagues were arrested for the Masuda Shemtov synagogue bombing, to prove that those on trial were not the perpetrators. =Claims of no Israeli involvement= Moshe Gat's analysis According to historian Moshe Gat, \\"not only did Israeli emissaries not place the bombs at the locations cited in the Iraqi statement, but also that there was in fact no need to take such drastic action in order to urge the Jews to leave Iraq for Israel\\".Moshe Gat, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3, Jul., 1988, pp. 312–329, The Connection between the bombing in Baghdad and the emigration of the Jews from Iraq: 1950–51,: \\"However in light of documents which have been made available by the National Archives in Washington, the British Public Record Office, the Haganah Archive, the Israel State Archive, and documents from the private records of Mordechai Ben-Porat, who was in charge of Jewish emigration in Iraq, we shall see that not only did Israeli emissaries not place the bombs at the locations cited in the Iraqi statement, but also that there was in fact no need to take such drastic action in order to urge the Jews to leave Iraq for Israel.\\" * Gat relates to the alleged Israeli motivation to accelerate the Jewish registration to leave Iraq: \\"just over 105,000 Jews had registered by 8 March, of whom almost 40,000 had left the country. Some 15,000 more left illegally before and after the law was passed. Since the number of Jews living in Iraq before emigration began has been estimated at 125,000 this means that about 5,000 Jews were left, who had preferred to remain in Iraq. Why, then, would anyone in Israel have wanted to throw bombs? Whom would they have wanted to intimidate?\\"\\" * Gat wrote that frantic Jewish registration for denaturalisation and departure was driven by knowledge that the denaturalisation law was due to expire in March 1951. He also noted the influence of further pressures including the property-freezing law and continued anti-Jewish disturbances, which raised the fear of large- scale pogroms.Gat 2013, p. 186 According to Mendes, it was highly unlikely that the Israelis would have taken such measures to accelerate the Jewish evacuation given that they were already struggling to cope with the existing level of Jewish immigration. * Gat also raised a number of questions about the trial and guilt of the alleged Jewish bomb throwers: **An Iraqi army officer known for his anti-Jewish views was originally arrested for the offenses, but never charged, after explosive devices similar to those used in the attack on the Jewish synagogue were found in his home. **The 1950–1951 bombings followed a long history of anti-Jewish incidents in Iraq and the prosecution was not able to produce a single eyewitness. **Shalom Salah told the court that he had confessed after being severely tortured. There were no other evidence which directly related the accused to the bombing, but only circumstantial evidence concerning the discovery of explosive devices and weapons. ** The 8 April 1950 bomb incident, in which 4 Jews were injured, was omitted from the charge sheet against the members of the underground, although it appeared in the government statement.Gat, 2013, p.183 The prosecutor \\"claimed that the perpetrators had planned to cause injury but not loss of life. The grenade, however, had claimed five lives at the synagogue (or four, according to the charges) and injured more than 20 people. This did not prevent the prosecutor, in his concluding address, from including this incident in the list of charges against the underground, although this contradicted the evidence of the two witnesses.\\"Gat 2013, p. 180 Nevertheless, they were not accused for the Synagogue bombing. Gat suggests the perpetrators could have been members of the anti-Jewish Istiqlal Party. Yehuda Tajar, one of the alleged bombers, said the bombing were carried out by the Muslim Brotherhood. According to Gat, \\"The British Foreign Office, which could hardly be suspected of proZionist tendencies, never stated explicitly that it was the defendants who had thrown the bombs\\" and \\"US Embassy reports also cast considerable doubt as to whether the two men convicted were in fact guilty of throwing the bombs. \\".Gat, 2013, p. 181 Other claims of no Israeli involvement Mordechai Ben Porat, founder and chair of the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center, who was coordinating Jewish emigration at the time, was accused of orchestrating a bombing campaign to speed up the Jewish exodus from Iraq by Israeli journalist Baruch Nadel in 1977. Ben Porat sued the journalist for libel, ending in an out-of-court compromise, where Nadel retracted all the accusations against the Israeli emissaries, and apologized In his 1996 book \\"To Baghdad and Back,\\" Ben-Porat published the full report of a 1960 investigation committee appointed by David Ben-Gurion, which \\"did not find any factual proof that the bombs were hurled by any Jewish organization or individual\\" and was \\"convinced that no entity in Israel gave an order to perpetrate such acts of sabotage.\\"To Baghdad and Back  Effects on Iraqi Jewish emigration Displaced Iraqi Jews arrive in Israel, 1951 In March 1950 the government of Iraq passed the Denaturalisation Act that allowed Jews to emigrate if they renounced their Iraqi citizenship. Iraqi prime minister Tawfiq al-Suwaidi expected that 7,000–10,000 Jews out of the Iraqi Jewish population of 125,000 would leave. A few thousand Jews registered for the offer before the first bombing occurred. The first bombing occurred on the last day of Passover, 8 April 1950. Panic in the Jewish community ensued and many more Jews registered to leave Iraq. The law expired in March 1951 but was extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews, including those who had already left. Between the first and last bombing almost the entire Jewish community bar a few thousand had registered to leave the country. The emigration of Jews was also due to the deteriorating status of Jews in Iraq since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as they were suspected of being disloyal to Iraq. They were treated with threats, suspicion and physical assaults and were portrayed by the media as a fifth column. By 1953, nearly all Jews had left the country. In his memoir of Jewish life in Baghdad, Sasson Somekh writes: \\"The pace of registration for the citizenship waiver was slow in the beginning, but it increased as tensions rose between Jews and their neighbors and after acts of terror were perpetrated against Jewish businesses and institutions – especially the Mas'uda Shem-Tov Synagogue...This was the place to which emigrating citizens were required to report with their luggage before leaving for Israel.\\"Baghdad, Yesterday:The Making of an Arab Jew, Sasson Somekh, Ibis, 2003, p. 153  See also  * Farhud * Shafiq Ades * Lavon Affair * Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries  References  =Bibliography=   * External links *Video of Benny Morris on the 1950 synagogue bombing in Baghdad Category:Arab–Israeli conflict Category:Jewish Iraqi history Category:Antisemitism in Iraq Category:1950 in Iraq Category:1951 in Iraq Category:1950 crimes in Iraq Category:Mass murder in 1951 Category:1950s murders in Iraq Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1950 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1951 Category:Jews and Judaism in Baghdad Category:Iraq–Israel relations Category:20th century in Baghdad Category:1951 crimes in Iraq Category:Terrorist incidents in Iraq in the 1950s Category:Terrorist incidents in Iraq ","title":"1950–1951 Baghdad bombings"},{"id":"43394464","text":"Samuel Clegg (2 April 1814 – 22 July 1856) was a British civil engineer.

Wagon manufacturing ceased on the site in the 1960s. As of 2011 the works was used as a maintenance facility by Freightliner (UK). History The original railway works in York, the Queen Street Works, York had been established in 1842, and carried out locomotive, carriage and wagon work. The wagon works was a separate building in the north-east of the site, near Queen Street.Ordnance Survey. Town Plans 1850s 1:1056 The building was extended westward in 1864, to give a production capacity of 100 wagons per week. In 1867 a separate wagon works was opened, north of North junction on the westward main rail line for the north. Expansion led to a site of with of buildings. The London and North Eastern Railway took over operation of the works in 1923 and after that date, new wagon building was concentrated on Faverdale Works (Darlington) and Shildon Works (County Durham), with York concentrating more on repairs. In 1931 a fire destroyed the work's sawmill. Subsequently a lifting shop was built on the sawmill site. After nationalisation into British Railways under the Transport Act 1947 further rationalisation for wagon production took place. Expected future requirement for wagons was also reduced, a 1956 report did not suggest any wagon works closures, but was superseded by another report in 1959, which recommended more closure and rationalisation, including the closure of the York Wagon Works in 1960. After Richard Beeching became chairman of the British Transport Commission (1961) all workshops came under centralised control from regional control, and a new report was commissioned, which recommended a similar pattern of closure as the 1959 report; York Wagon Works was to close in 1963. The works had closed by 1964. Maintenance and repair of wagons continued at the site; in the 1980s repair of departmental wagons was being undertaken by Trainload Freight. Between 1997 and 2002 wagon manufacture was undertaken for English Welsh and Scottish Railway by Thrall Europa (Thrall Car Manufacturing Company) at the Holgate Road carriage works, York.

He held the iqta' of Bayana in present-day India. Ulugh Khan played an important role in Alauddin's ascension to the throne of Delhi in 1296. He lured the former Sultan Jalaluddin to Kara, where Alauddin assassinated Jalaluddin. He successfully besieged Multan, and subjugated the surviving members of Jalaluddin's family. In 1298, Ulugh Khan repulsed a Mongol invasion from the Chagatai Khanate, which greatly increased Alauddin's prestige. The next year, he and Nusrat Khan raided the wealthy province of Gujarat, obtaining a huge amount of wealth for Alauddin's treasury. He led the reinforcement unit in the Battle of Kili (1299) against the Mongols, and held command in the initial phases of the Siege of Ranthambore (1301). He died a few months after the Ranthambore campaign ended, although a fictional account in Amir Khusrau's Ashiqa suggests that he led Alauddin's forces in the later years.  Early life  Ulugh Khan was originally known as Almas Beg. His father Shihabuddin Mas'ud was the elder brother of the Khalji dynasty's founder Sultan Jalaluddin. Besides his elder brother Alauddin (originally known as Ali Gurshasp), he had two other brothers Qutlugh Tigin and Muhammad. Both Alauddin and Ulugh Khan married Jalaluddin's daughters. After Jalaluddin became the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin was appointed as Amir-i-Tuzuk (equivalent to Master of ceremonies), while Almas Beg was given the post of Akhur-beg (equivalent to Master of the Horse).  Role in Alauddin's ascension  In 1291, Jalaluddin appointed Alauddin as the governor of Kara province. Over the next few years, Alauddin hatched a conspiracy to overthrow Jalaluddin. In 1296, Alauddin raided Devagiri, but did not surrender the loot to Jalaluddin in Delhi. Instead, he returned to Kara, and then sent a letter of apology to Jalaluddin. Ulugh Khan assured Jalaluddin that Alauddin was loyal to him, and convinced him to visit Kara and meet Alauddin, saying that Alauddin would commit suicide out of guilt if Jalaluddin didn't pardon him personally. A gullible Jalaluddin visited Kara, where Alauddin killed him on 20 July 1296. When Alauddin became the Sultan of Delhi in 1296, he made his brother barbeg with the title Ulugh Khan (\\"Great Khan\\".).  Military career  Ulugh Khan was an able general, and played an important role in Alauddin's military conquests. According to Ziauddin Barani, Alauddin once thought of establishing a new religion, and compared his four generals (Ulugh, Nusrat, Zafar and Alp) to Muhammad's four Rashidun caliphs. = Siege of Multan = After usurping the throne of Delhi, Alauddin decided to eliminate the surviving family of Jalaluddin. In November 1296, he sent a 30,000-40,000 strong army led by Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan to Multan, which was governed by Jalaluddin's son Arkali Khan. Faced with a certain defeat, the leaders of the defending forces deserted Arkali Khan and defected to the Delhi forces after two months of siege. Arkali Khan and his younger brother Ruknuddin Ibrahim visited Ulugh Khan's camp to negotiate a truce. Ulugh Khan received them with dignity, and promised not to harm them. However, after occupying Multan, he did not keep this promise, and imprisoned them, their family members, and their loyal officers. The captives were later blinded and/or killed by Nusrat Khan on Alauddin's orders. = 1298 victory over the Mongols = In the winter of 1297, the Mongols led by a noyan of the Chagatai Khanate raided Punjab, advancing as far as Kasur. Alauddin dispatched Ulugh Khan (possibly supported by Zafar Khan) to check the Mongol advance. According to the Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau, Ulugh Khan covered the distance of two marches in a single day to face the Mongols, and reached the banks of the Sutlej River on 6 February 1298. There, he ordered his soldiers to cross the Sutlej River without the boats, and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mongols. Khusrau states that 20,000 Mongols were killed in the battle, and many more were killed in Delhi after being brought there as captives. The victory increased Alauddin's prestige, and stabilized his position on the throne of Delhi. = Gujarat = In early 1299, Alauddin sent an army led by Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan to invade the wealthy Vaghela-ruled kingdom of Gujarat. According to the Jain chronicler Jinaprabha Suri, Ulugh Khan's forces defeated the army of the defending king Karna at Asapalli (present-day Ahmedabad). Karna fled from the battlefield, after which Ulugh Khan's army thoroughly sacked the wealthy city of Anahilavada (Patan). According to Jinaprabha, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan destroyed hundreds of other towns, including Asapalli, Vanmanthali and Surat. They also looted several monasteries, palaces and temples. This account is also confirmed by the Muslim chroniclers Ziauddin Barani and Isami. The Delhi army left Gujarat with a huge amount of wealth and several prisoners. During a halt near Jalore, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan punished some of the soldiers for not remitting the khums (one-fifth share of the loot) to the imperial treasury. This resulted in a mutiny, mainly by the Mongol (Mughal) soldiers, who had converted to Islam recently. The mutineers murdered Ulugh Khan's secretary and Nusrat Khan's brother Malik A'izzudin. The next day, around 2000-3000 of them attacked Ulugh Khan's camp. The attackers misidentified a nephew of Alauddin as Ulugh Khan, and killed him. Ulugh Khan, who was in a lavatory at the time of the attack, escaped to Nusrat Khan's tent, where the loyal soldiers assembled and forced the rebels to retreat. After the army reached Delhi, severe punishments were meted out to the family members of the rebels. = Battle of Kili = While Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan were in Gujarat, Zafar Khan repulsed a Mongol invasion in Sindh. This victory established Zafar Khan's reputation as a brilliant general, and according to the near-contemporary chronicler Ziauddin Barani, made both Alauddin and Ulugh Khan jealous of Zafar Khan's newly acquired fame. Barani also claims that the two brothers made plans to blind or poison Zafar Khan. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena doubts the truthfulness of Barani's allegations. At the 1299 Battle of Kili against the Mongols, Ulugh Khan led the reinforcement unit of the Delhi army. During the battle, Zafar Khan attacked a Mongol contingent without Alauddin's permission, and was killed after inflicting heavy casualties on the Mongols. According to the 17th-century historian Hajiuddabir's Zafarul-vali, Ulugh Khan did not come to Zafar Khan's rescue because he maintained an ill-will against Zafar Khan. The Mongols ultimately retreated from the battlefield. = Siege of Ranthambhore = In 1299, Hammira, the Chahamana ruler of Ranthambore, had granted asylum to the Mongol fugitives who had led the mutiny against Ulugh Khan at Jalore. Ulugh Khan, who was the governor of Bayana near Ranthambore, urged Hammira to kill these fugitives as a friendly ruler or face an invasion. When Hammira refused to kill or surrender the fugitives, Alauddin ordered Ulugh Khan to invade Ranthambore in 1301. Ulugh Khan marched up to the Banas River, where he defeated and killed Hammira's general Bhimasimha. Subsequently, the Delhi army suffered a defeat at a mountain pass called Hinduvata. Alauddin dispatched Nusrat Khan in support of Ulugh Khan, and the reinforced Delhi army once again marched towards Ranthambore. According to the Hammira Mahakavya, this time, Ulugh Khan pretended that he was coming to negotiate a truce with Hammira, and therefore, Hammira allowed him to cross the Hinduvata mountain pass. The Delhi army captured Jhain, and then reached Ranthambore, where Nusrat Khan was killed during the siege. Taking advantage of the mourning in the invaders' camp, Hammira's army attacked them, and forced Ulugh Khan to retreat to Jhain. When Alauddin learned about Ulugh Khan's defeat, he personally led a stronger army to Ranthambore. While he was at Ranthambore, an officer called Haji Maula took control of Delhi, prompting Alauddin to send his general Malik Hamiduddin to Delhi. Some days later, Alauddin received the news that Haji Maula had appointed Iltutmish's descendant Alavi as a puppet monarch in Delhi. Alauddin then sent Ulugh Khan to Delhi. By the time Ulugh Khan reached Delhi, Hamiduddin had already quelled the revolt. Ulugh Khan ordered all the surviving rebels to be killed. The grandsons of Haji Maula's former master Fakhruddin were also killed, although they had not played any part in the rebellion. Alauddin captured the fort in July 1301, and placed it under Ulugh Khan's charge. However, the local public hated Ulugh Khan so much, that he decided not to go beyond the suburbs of Ranthambore.  Last days  After his conquest of Ranthambore in 1301, Alauddin ordered Ulugh Khan to prepare for a march to the Kakatiya capital Warangal. Ulugh Khan assembled a large army, but died a few months later. According to the 14th-century chronicler Ziauddin Barani, his death greatly depressed Alauddin, who gave a lot of money away in charity for the salvation of his soul. However, Barani's contemporary chronicler Isami claims that Alauddin had ordered Ulugh Khan's killing by poisoning. During Alauddin's march to Ranthambore, his nephew Akat Khan made an attempt to assassinate him. When Alauddin fell unconscious, Akat Khan wrongly believed him to be dead, and spread the news. According to Isami's account, a servant of Alauddin told the Sultan that on hearing this news, Ulugh Khan had remarked that he was ready to fill the vacant throne. This made Alauddin suspicious of Ulugh Khan, leading to Ulugh Khan's murder. The 16th- century chronicler Husam Khan, in his Tabaqat-i-Bahadur Shahi, also attributes Ulugh Khan's death to poisoning, a claim repeated by the later chronicler Haji-ud-dabir. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena dismisses Isami's account as false. However, Kishori Saran Lal believes that given Alauddin's temperament, it is not impossible that he had his brother killed. In 1304, Alauddin sent another army to Gujarat, and annexed it to the Delhi Sultanate. According to Amir Khusrau's Ashiqa, which is of little historical value, Ulugh Khan led this invasion. However, this claim is of doubtful accuracy, and is not supported by other sources. Isami names the commander of the second Gujarat campaign as Malik Jhitam, not Ulugh Khan. The 16th-century historian Firishta also suggests that Ulugh Khan was already dead by this time. The 18th century text Mirat-i-Ahmadi claims that Ulugh Khan governed Gujarat for 20 years, and was later executed as a result of a conspiracy by Malik Kafur. However, the author has obviously confused Alp Khan with Alauddin's brother Ulugh Khan.

The building is located at 1 American Road at Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, Michigan, near Ford's historic Rouge plant, Greenfield Village, the Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn's Henry Ford Centennial Library, and Fair Lane, Henry Ford's personal estate. In 2008, columnist George Will said the building opened at \\"the peak of American confidence\\" and described the headquarters as having a \\"sleek glass-and-steel minimalism that characterized up-to-date architecture in the 1950s, when America was at the wheel of the world and even buildings seemed streamlined for speed\\". While under design and construction, the building was called the \\"Central Staff Office Building\\" and was later referred to as the \\"New Central Office Building\\" to distinguish it from the company's prior headquarters nearby. The building was later referred to as the \\"Ford Motor Company Administrative Center\\" and was formally renamed the Henry Ford II World Center in June 1996. In early 2016, Ford announced a redesign of the headquarters building and its surrounding campus, scheduled to begin in 2021 and projected to connect the Glass House to a series of new and existing buildings, parking decks, soccer fields and an arboretum. Design and construction Formally announced in 1950, the new Central Staff Office Building was delayed by construction moratoriums in place during the Korean War. Construction broke ground on September 29, 1953 and the building was dedicated on September 26, 1956. In addition to the prominent 12-story office building, the Glass House includes an adjacent three-story structure accommodating an employee cafeteria, dining rooms and parking garage for 1500 cars—the two elements connected by a concourse. The headquarters was designed in the International Style by noted architects Gordon Bunshaft and Natalie de Blois, both with the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. De Blois designed the three-story portion of the complex. Described as a \\"tall city in a park,\\" the complex was master planned by William L. Pereira and Associates of Los Angeles, requiring multiple entry points to adequately serve the concentrated daily influx of cars. Located on (originally ) previously belonging to Henry Ford's private estate, the grounds have since 1966 also been the site for the Arjay Miller Arboretum, featuring trees and shrubs native to Michigan. Constructed of reinforced concrete with an estimated of tinted, heat-absorbing glass, and standing tall, the Glass House features central air conditioning, escalators on the first seven floors to augment elevators, movable interior partitions and glass partitions for primary interior corridors. To maximize interior flexibility, structural columns are located outside the exterior curtain wall or within the building's core, providing a clear interior span for office space. In addition to the tinted, heat absorbing glass, the facade's curtain wall was designed with , light-weight sandwich panels composed of five layers: an outermost layer of 16-gauge porcelain enameled steel bonded to a expanded aluminum honeycomb, a sheet of 24–gauge galvanized steel, of cellular insulation (marketed as Foamglas) and finally an interior 18–gauge steel skin. The building used 6,616 panels in a semi-matte green color and was the largest known use of porcelain enamel composite panels in a single building at the time of its construction, using over of the material. The long side of the building's rooftop mechanical penthouse screen walls originally featured the word \\"FORD\\" in tall block lettering–later replaced with the company's trademark Blue Oval logo. In 1999, the company replaced the \\"Blue Oval\\" at the penthouse screen wall with the words \\"Ford Motor Company\\" in the company's original trademark script, referred to by Ford as the \\"trustmark\\". Ford returned the \\"Blue Oval\\" again to the penthouse screenwalls in 2003, in time for the company's centennial. Background and awards Prior to the Glass House, Ford's central staff occupied a headquarters, the 3000 Schaefer Building, constructed in 1928 at the corner of Schaefer Road and what is now Rotunda Drive in Dearborn. The building was subsequently occupied by the Lincoln Mercury division after completion of the Glass House, later became the Ford Parts Department and was ultimately razed in 1997. The Skidmore Owings & Merrill 1956 headquarters building won the Office of the Year Award from Administrative Management Magazine in 1956 and in 1967 an Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Steel Construction. Artwork and illuminations In 1955, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, architects of the Glass House, commissioned an sculpture, a welded metal screen, by artist Thomas Fulton McClure (1920–2009) for its new headquarters, while the building was still under construction—and at the time called the \\"Central Staff Office Building\\". For the 1996 rechristening of the building, Ford commissioned a full-size bronze statue of Henry Ford II by artist Richard R. Miller. The sculpture stands in the building's lobby and depicts Henry Ford II in an informal standing pose. The figure itself is tall. On the evening of September 15, 2008, the office lights at Ford World Headquarters were \\"strategically\\" illuminated to spell \\"Happy 100 GM,\\" in honor of its chief rival General Motors' 100th anniversary. In 2009, Ford illuminated the facade of the Glass House in pink for two nights, in support of the Susan G. Komen for the Cure cancer awareness program.

It is under the management of the National Park Service. History Fort Totten was a Union Army defensive earthwork, built during the Civil War and named for Joseph Totten. It was built up during the fall of 1861, as part of the defense of Washington, D.C., during the Civil War, also known as the Fort Circle. Construction on the fort began in August 1861 and was completed in 1863.Fort Totten - Civil War Defenses of Washington (U.S. National Park Service) Fort Totten was one of seven temporary earthwork forts built in the Northeast quadrant of the city by the Union Army to protect the city from the Confederate Army. From west to east, the forts were as follow: Fort Slocum, Fort Totten, Fort Slemmer, Fort Bunker Hill, Fort Saratoga, Fort Thayer and Fort Lincoln. Today, it has become a park administered by the National Park Service in the neighborhood of Fort Totten. Structure Fort Totten was a medium-sized fort, a seven-sided polygon with a perimeter of . It was located atop a ridge along the main road from Washington to Silver Spring, Maryland, about three miles (5 km) north of the Capitol, and a half-mile from the Military Asylum or Soldiers' Home, where President Abraham Lincoln spent his summers while president. The fort was of typical design for its time, with earth walls some thick and high. Outside the walls (or \\"ramparts\\") was a large ditch or dry moat over seven feet deep and twelve feet wide, and outside that was a broad cleared area surrounding a barrier of tree branches, brambles and general debris (or abatis). Along the inner surface of the wall were gun platforms for several types of cannon, some firing over the parapet, others firing through openings in it, and a banquette, a kind of shelf on which soldiers could stand to fire over the wall.

Foundation The Collegiate was on the river bank in the south downtown area of Saskatoon. Saskatoon's Chinatown was destroyed in the late 1920s to make room for the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate and a legion hall. The Collegiate was completed in 1931. On 7 November 1932 a group of unemployed men who had gathered on the school grounds was forcibly removed by a joint force of police and RCMP. History The Collegiate had the largest gymnasium in the city. Its women's basketball team won the provincial championship in the 1932–33 season. The artist Ernest Lindner started to teach at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate in 1931, first giving a night course and then becoming a full-time instructor. He headed the Art Department at the Collegiate from 1936 until 1962. Ted Pulford (1914-1994) studied under Lindner, who brought him to love watercolor. He went on to become a noted artist and teacher at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick. Ivan Kenneth Eyre was another of Lindner's students who became well known as an artist. Ernest C.F. Chan, born near Canton, China in 1909, came to Canada in 1928. In 1939 he became a teacher at the Collegiate, the first person from China to teach in a public school in Canada. Chan became president of the Saskatoon Rotary Club, the Saskatoon Highland Dancing Association, and the Saskatoon Folk Arts Council. Joan Anderson, later known as Joni Mitchell, took art classes at the Collegiate in the late 1950s. She studied under Henry Bonli (1927–2011), an Abstract Expressionist painter.

Commissioned in Rome by the renowned connoisseur Cassiano dal Pozzo, the scene depicts a dying man being anointed with oil in accordance with the rites of the early Roman church. To enhance the realism of the scene, Poussin drew on his extensive study of the art and artefacts of classical antiquity to represent the costumes, setting, and the structure of the painting itself, with the figures disposed frieze-like across the composition. This classicising tendency went on to make an inestimable impact on Western art, influencing many of the greatest painters of subsequent generations, from Jacques-Louis David and Ingres to Cézanne and Picasso; even today artists continue to be inspired by Poussin’s work and ideas about painting. In treating themes of death and dying, Poussin revealed himself at his most ambitious, consciously pitting himself against no less an artist than the ancient Greek painter Apelles who was, Poussin wrote, \\"[much] pleased ... to represent scenes of death.\\" Today, the sobriety and control of Poussin's paintings can seem difficult, or remote, to audiences. But in Extreme Unction subject and style are so perfectly aligned that Poussin's stark, lyrical, line, and controlled play of light and shadow bring out the full depth of emotion that marks this momentous scene. Death remains one of the last great taboos in much of the developed world. Poussin's painting addresses with potency and directness the universal message of human mortality: through the rhythmic beauty of the compositional line and passages of resplendent, even joyous, colour, Poussin allows us to contemplate and engage with the most natural and inevitable of events in human existence.  Poussin, England, and the Rutland Sacraments  Poussin initially painted for a relatively small, but hugely enthusiastic, group of patrons, but by the 18th century collectors throughout Europe were clamouring to buy his pictures. Lord Fitzwilliam was one, though later scholarship proved that his would-be Poussin was a copy. The Duke of Rutland was more fortunate, and his purchase in 1785 of Poussin’s series of Seven Sacraments – then among the most his important works to be seen in Rome – caused a sensation in England. Their acquisition was heralded as a coup for the nation, and when the series was exhibited at the Royal Academy it was visited by King George III himself.  Acquisition by the Fitzwilliam Museum  The set of Sacraments is no longer complete: one, Penance, was destroyed by fire in 1816, Baptism was sold around 1939 and is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and Ordination was sold in 2011 to the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas. As a result of this last sale, and consequent Inheritance Tax, the Fitzwilliam Museum was offered through H.M. Government's Acceptance in Lieu scheme the unique opportunity to purchase the painting for £3.9 million from the Trustees of the 11th Duke of Rutland 2000 Settlement, a fraction of its agreed value, £14,000,000.

Biography Born in Gorinchem, De Gijselaar was educated at the Latin School in Breda and earned a doctorate in Roman and Modern Law from Leiden University in 1774.Mr. C. de Gijselaar at www.parlement.com, retrieved 26 July 2014 . He was a pensionary (civil servant) in Gorinchem from 26 May 1776 until 1779. From 1779 until 11 October 1787, he was a pensionary of Dordrecht. Together with Adriaan van Zeebergh and Engelbert François van Berckel, pensionaries of Haarlem and Amsterdam, he supported the Dutch Patriots faction, which sought greater autonomy for citizens and less power for the House of Orange during the time of the Dutch Republic. In the 1780s, he was considered one of the leaders of the faction, and the patriots were nicknamed Kezen after his first name. Kees had a little dog that followed him everywhere, and with the time became the symbol of this faction, and was known as Keeshond (Kees' dog). The patriots wore Keeshond pins to signal their allegiance, whereas the Orangists used the orange (tawny) pug as a symbol.1781-1795 Patriots vs Orangists , Timeline Dutch History, Rijksmuseum, retrieved 26 July 2014.Keeshond, Historical Museum of the Hague, retrieved 3 Jan 2017 . After the Prussian intervention and the restoration of the Oranges in 1787, he lost his leading role and moved to Brussels, where he lived for ten years. He declined offers to become politically active again in 1795 and 1814. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1809. Cornelis de Gijselaar moved to Leiden after his wife's death, and died there in 1815.

History and nature of the dumping ground  This was a small-scale dumping ground, which was a modest and a harmless one. Domestic waste, paper and ashes were taken there. No industrial waste was taken there, but quite a few of it ended up there as a result of other operations. Both the beginning and the end of the dumping ground are to some extent unknown. It is thought that it was begun in 1937, on a clay soil. It is thought that the beginning is connected to the building of the Tilkka Military Hospital, which represents the functionalist style and was completed in 1936. The dumping activity probably came to an end when the Pasila dumping ground was taken to use in 1949 and replaced the one in Pikku-Huopalahti. Poor man’s Stockmann A car repair shop in Poor man’s Stockmann in November 1970 After the place was no longer officially a dumping ground, it still looked like it for decades. The place and its surroundings were then known locally as Poor man’s Stockmann, the reference being both to the wide range of “goods” found in the area and to the Stockmann Department Store in Helsinki City Centre. The area was located between Tilkka and the Pikku-Huopalahti Bay. The economic activity in the area consisted of various kinds of small-scale manufacturing industry and businesses, e.g. demolition of cars, and, it seems, junk yards and second-hand stores. It is possible that the rubbish generated was not transported anywhere else but remained at the site. The dumping ground was covered with earth and blaste stone, but the soil was polluted because of the economic activity. Heavy metals, oil and hydrocarbons were found in the soil. The Finnish Member of Parliament Osmo Soininvaara mentions Poor man’s Stockmann in his blog and gives the impression that the wrecking yard business in the area emerged more or less spontaneously, outside of urban planning, and possibly without any kinds of permits applied. Poor man’s Stockmann still existed in the 1980s. Some scenes of the Uuno Turhapuro films were shot there, those that took place at the car repair shop where Härski Hartikainen and Sörsselssön worked. The area today The original dumping ground is no longer visible on the site, since for all practical purposes it has disappeared decades ago. The site was cleaned up before the new residential district of Pikku Huopalahti was built in the 1990s. The site was investigated, and the soil of the garden plots now found on the Niemenmäki side was changed. Elsewhere the former matter of the dumping ground is isolated by a special layer of landfill, and the top soil is new. The rubbish itself has decayed completely.

It consisted of the dean and the canons, priests attached to the cathedral who were known as \\"prebendaries\\" because of the source of their income. The Dean and Chapter (or \\"Greater Chapter\\") was made up of a large number of priests who would meet \\"in chapter\\", but such meetings were infrequent and the actual governance was done by the Administrative Chapter headed by the dean, made up of several senior \\"residentiary canons\\", who were also known as the \\"Dean and Canons of St Paul’s\\" or simply \\"The Chapter\\". The Cathedrals Measure 1999, a reform applying to nearly all cathedrals, termed the main governing body of the cathedrals \\"the Chapter\\"; reformed the Greater Chapter to include archdeacons and suffragan and assistant bishops (but not the diocesan bishop) as well as lay canons, giving it the title \\"The College of Canons\\" with the dean as its president; and also introduced a \\"Cathedral Council\\" responsible for changing the Constitution and Statutes and for approving the budget and accounts. The Measure also required lay people to be appointed to the Chapter. The titular corporate body has been known since 2000 as \\"The Corporation of the Cathedral Church of St Paul in London\\", and its membership consists of the members for the time being of the Chapter, the College of Canons, and the Council: the term \\"Dean and Chapter\\" is no longer valid in law. The Chapter is headed by the Dean of St Paul's, currently the Very Revd David Ison who was installed on 25 May 2012, and includes four ordained residentiary canons and up to four lay people. Up to the early twentieth century canons were attached to prebendal stalls, and by the early thirteenth century, there were 30 of these.The domesday of St. Paul's of the year M.CC.XXII. Printed for the Camden society, 1858 Many of the prebendal manors were some distance from the cathedral. For many years, the rents of these manors provided sufficiently valuable income to render the great majority of the prebendaries indifferent to reside at the cathedral and benefit from the increase in income that this would provide. Many of the prebends were awarded to senior clergy, including archdeacons and bishops, to top-up insufficient income from their archbishoprics, bishoprics and archdeaconries. Fourteen of the prebendaries later became archbishops. The prebendaries survived the reforms during the middle of the sixteenth century, perhaps because the cathedral had not been a monastic institution.Annals of St Paul’s Cathedral, Henry Hart Milman, Murray, 1868. The prebendal estates were taken over by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in the later nineteenth century in exchange for a cash payment, the value of which was almost entirely lost to inflation during the twentieth century.

They are typically simple, brick-clad high-rise buildings with rectangular footprints and little ornamentation other than repeating series of balconies for each apartment. However, some apartment buildings from this era use less conventional designs in the \\"tower in the park\\" format, such as the Prince Arthur Towers, Jane-Exbury Towers and 44 Walmer Road designed by Uno Prii.

Baron Von Fancy in New York City in 2016 Background Baron Von Fancy was born in New York City and attended Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School. He earned his Bachelor in Fine Arts from Bard College in 2006. Gordon Stevenson identifies himself by his birth name for his artwork displayed in galleries, and he uses the artistic name \\"Baron Von Fancy\\" to sign his work used for commercial products. For example, his lighters are signed Baron Von Fancy, whereas his paintings are signed with his birth name. Work Baron Von Fancy works in various media in addition to canvas. He has applied his distinctive artistic sensibility to create a broad range of tangible, practical items such as sponges, doormats, socks, backpacks, lighters, bow ties, matchboxes, handbags, cell phone cases and shirts. Clever and enchanting at the same time, Von Fancy's work spans the spectrum from light-hearted to profound, or, at times, from playful to crude. =Collaborations= Von Fancy has collaborated with fashion, sportswear and media brands. Among the brands that he has worked with are: Nike, Google, Vans, Uber, Rag & Bone, Reece Hudson, Reformation, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, Gitman Vintage, Smith Optics and MeUndies.

That Summer, Converse selected Baron Von Fancy (among other artists) for social media promotion of its Chuck Taylor All-Star II, the first changes to Converse's highly successful line of sneakers in nearly a century. In his signature typeface, Von Fancy prepared several phrases for display on Converse's Twitter page, including \\"Can't Wait,\\" \\"What's Next?\\", and \\"Ready for More.\\" For Valentine's Day 2015, Kreemart presented an exhibition of his work at Melissa Galerie's SoHo store. Paperless Post launched a collaboration with Baron on Valentine's Day 2014, featuring his greeting cards, invitations and Valentine's Day cards. =Billboards and public work= For the past five years, Baron Von Fancy has displayed his art on billboards in the SoHo neighborhood and elsewhere in his native New York City. Billboards featuring playful and charming expressions such as \\"On my way to steal your girl,\\" \\"Don't call me baby,\\" \\"Never not working,\\" and \\"May the bridges I burn light the way,\\" among others, have greeted New Yorkers in Manhattan and its environs as they look skyward since at least 2013. Von Fancy's billboard \\"On my way to steal your girl\\" In May 2016, his billboard featuring the edgy phrase \\"If you're feeling down, I can feel you up\\" was posted in lower Manhattan at the intersection of Canal and West Broadway. In the Summer of 2013, his \\"I Can't Grow Up\\" mural was displayed on a billboard on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side. In October 2013, for its 125th anniversary celebration, Katz's Delicatessen invited Baron to contribute a work to their pop-up art gallery housed next to the deli.

Baron Von Fancy also is known for other of his numerous collections which include homemade prison artifacts, pre-9/11 Twin Towers ephemera, and peep show sex tokens. =Phrases= A hallmark of Baron Von Fancy's signature style is a handwritten phrase or statement in dark black letters. In some cases, the lettering is accented with bright colors, particularly green, pink, and yellow. Von Fancy exercises considerable range in these expressions, which have been described as \\"poignant,\\" \\"playful,\\" \\"clever,\\" \\"oscillat[ing] from colloquial to profound,\\" \\"bold,\\" \\"poetic,\\" and \\"reminiscent of the classic, hand-painted billboards that populated New York in the 1950s and 1960s.\\" =Sports collector= Stevenson is a sports collector, primarily of baseball memorabilia, but also of the UFC. His collection includes Babe Ruth baseballs, the first baseball bat that Mike Trout ever used in a game and got a hit with, New York Mets championship rings, and the Superfight championship belt from the second fight between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie at UFC 5.

A specialist stayer, he won eight of his thirty-four races, finished second nine times and third on five occasions. He showed promise as a two-year-old in 1975, despite being beaten in all three of his races. In the following season he established himself as a good performer in handicaps, winning five races including the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot and finishing second in the Jockey Club Cup. In 1977 he emerged as a top-class stayer despite winning only once from eleven starts: he won the Doncaster Cup and was placed in the Paradise Stakes, Yorkshire Cup, Queen Alexandra Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes. Shangamuzo reached his peak as a five-year-old in 1978 when he engaged in a series of races against the outstanding French-bred stayer Buckskin. Shangamuzo decisively defeated Buckskin in both the Sagaro Stakes and the Ascot Gold Cup but after sustaining an injury in the Goodwood Cup he was beaten by his rival in the Doncaster Cup and the Jockey Club Cup. After an unsuccessful campaign in 1979 he was retired to stud in Brazil, where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Shangamuzo, was a big, powerful, dark chestnut horse with a small white star and a white sock on his right hind leg bred in England by Henry Rogers Broughton, 2nd Baron Fairhaven. His sire Klairon was a top-class racehorse whose wins included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1955. Apart from Shangamuzo, he sired the Champion Stakes winner Lorenzaccio and Prix Jacques Le Marois winner Luthier. Klairon was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Shangamuzo was one of several winners produced by his dam French Fern, a high-class racemare who won the Ribblesdale Stakes in 1960 and was rated 118 by Timeform. As a descendant of the broodmare French Kiss, she was a distant relative of the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Barathea. In 1974, as a yearling, Shangamuzo was offered for sale and bought for 3000 guineas by representatives of Mrs E. White. He was first sent into training with John Sutcliffe at Epsom. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced in his first two starts over seven furlongs, Shangamuzo ran in a twenty-two runner maiden race over a mile at Sandown Park Racecourse in October. He showed some promise in finishing fifth, without being given a hard race. =1976: three-year-old season= Shangamuzo emerged as a successful handicapper in the first half of his three- year-old season, in which he was trained by Gavin Hunter. On his first appearance of the season he won a maiden race over eleven furlongs at Kempton and then finished second to Lighter in a handicap over on and a half miles at Haydock in June, but was awarded the race after the \\"winner\\" was disqualified for causing interference. Later that month he was sent to Royal Ascot and recorded his first major success in the King George V Stakes and was then stepped up in distance to win a minor event over two miles at Newcastle Racecourse. Shangamuzo's winning run came to an end when he finished fifth in a race at Newbury and he then finished third to Sir Montagu and the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Alverton in the Ebor Handicap at York in August. On his next appearance, Shangamuzo defeated Alverton by one and a half lengths in the Top Rank Club Handicap at Newcastle to win his fifth race of the season. In October, the colt was moved up in class and finished second to Bright Finish in the Group Three Jockey Club Cup over two miles at Newmarket. =1977: four-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his debut at a four-year-old, Shangamuzo finished second by a neck to the filly Centrocon in the Paradise Stakes at Newbury. In May he ran third to Bright Finish and Grey Baron in the Yorkshire Cup and was then sent to France and finished fourth behind Buckskin, Sagaro and Citoyen in the Prix du Cadran at Longchamp Racecourse. At Royal Ascot, he ran in the two and three quarter mile Queen Alexandra Stakes and finished second behind the six-year-old John Cherry, who, as a gelding, was not allowed to compete in many of the major staying races. Later in June, Shangamuzo reverted to handicaps and ran one of his few poor races when unplaced behind Tug of War in the Northumberland Plate. After a break of two and a half months, Shangamuzo returned in the Doncaster Cup in which he was ridden by Pat Eddery and started a 33/1 outsider. His opponents were Tug of War, Grey Baron, Bruni and the Dick Hern-trained four-year-old Belfalas. Shangamuzo took the lead half a mile from the finish and was never in any danger of defeat, recording his first Group race win by four lengths from Belfalas, with Grey Baron a further four lengths back in third. He then finished second to Nearly A Hand when carrying top weight of 141 pounds in the Newbury Autumn Cup. In his second attempt to win the Jockey Club Cup, Shangamuzo led from the start but was caught inside the final furlong and was beaten three quarters of a length by Grey Baron. On his final appearance of the season, he finished sixth behind John Cherry in the Prix Gladiateur over 4000 metres at Longchamp on 30 October. =1978: five-year-old season= In 1978, Shangamuzo moved to the Newmarket stable of Michael Stoute. On his first appearance for his new trainer, Shangamuzo started at odds of 12/1 for the Sagaro Stakes (formerly the Paradise Stakes) on very soft ground at Ascot in April. Ridden by Greville Starkey, he took the lead in the straight and drew away from his rivals to win by twelve lengths from the favourite Buckskin. In his next two races, Shangamuzo finished second to the Dick Hern-trained five- year-old Smuggler in the Yorkshire Cup and the Henry II Stakes. At York, Shangamuzo was beaten two lengths by Smuggler when attempting to concede three pounds to his rival, but was widely expected to reverse the form at level weights over a longer distance at Sandown. In the Henry II Stakes, however, Shangamuzo appeared to be unsuited by the firm ground, and was beaten two and a half lengths. Shangamuzo, ridden by Starkey, started at odds of 13/2 for the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot, with Buckskin starting favourite ahead of the filly Royal Hive (winner of the Park Hill Stakes). The other runners included Duky and Hawkberry who had finished second and third to Buckskin in the Prix du Cadran. Smuggler did not contest the Gold Cup, his owner, Lord Porchester stating that the unfashionable status of stayers as breeding stallions meant that it would devalue the horse to even enter him in the race. Buckskin's pacemaker Palei set a strong pace until six furlongs from the finish when Shangamuzo moved into the lead with Buckskin close behind. The two engaged in a brief struggle before Shangamuzo established a decisive advantage on the turn into the straight. He was never seriously challenged in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Royal Hive, with Hawkberry a length and a half away in third. Timeform described Shangamuzo's performance as \\"a magnificent display of courage and endurance\\". In the Goodwood Cup, Shangamuzo conceded weight to his rivals and led for most of the way but was caught in the closing stages and finished third behind Tug of War and the three-year-old Arapahos. It was subsequently discovered that the horse had sustained a leg injury in the race which kept him off the racecourse until the autumn. On his return to racing, Shangamuzo was matched against Buckskin in two races which were expected to decide the identity of the best staying horse in Europe. In the Doncaster Cup, Shangamuzo appeared less than fully fit and finished third behind Buckskin and Billion. In October, Shangamuzo and Buckskin met for the final time in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmmarket. There appeared to be no excuses for Shangamuzo on this occasion as he proved no match for his rival and was beaten eight lengths into second place. =1979: six-year-old season= Shangamuzo remained in training as a six-year-old but failed to recover his best form in four races. His best effort came when he finished fourth of five, beaten four lengths by El Badr in the Prix du Cadran. On his final appearance he finished a distant fourth behind Le Moss, Buckskin and Arapahos in the Ascot Gold Cup. Assessment In 1975, the independent Timeform organisation did not give a rating to Shangamuzo but awarded him a \\"p\\", indicating that the colt was likely to make more than normal progress, and commented that he was certain to stay one and a half miles. In the following year, Shangamuzo was given a weight of 117 pounds in the official British Free Handicap, twenty-three pounds below the top-rated Vitiges. He was given a rating of 108 by Timeform, twenty-one pounds behind their best stayer Sagaro, and was described in their annual Racehorses of 1976 as \\"very genuine and consistent\\". In 1977, Shangamuzo's Timeform rating improved to 121, twelve pounds behind the best stayers Sagaro and Dunfermline. In the inaugural International Classification, he was given a rating of 84, ten pounds below the top-rated older horses Balmerino and Orange Bay. In 1978, Shangamuzo achieved his peak Timeform rating of 125, eight pounds below the best stayer Buckskin. In the International Classification he was rated seven pounds below Buckskin and sixteen pounds behind the top-rated Alleged. His abbreviated 1979 season saw him awarded a 113 rating by Timeform. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Shangamuzo as an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Gold Cup.

Across the river, the extension, now connected to the Reading's South Walnut Street Branch, which it crosses, can be seen running into the Southside neighborhood on C Street. The South Side Extension of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) was a rail line that ran from its Market Street Branch at West Yard Junction, on the west side of Wilmington, Delaware, across the Christina River to serve industrial areas on the south side of Wilmington. Originally built by the Delaware Western Railroad and opened in 1872, it became a branch of the B&O; when that railroad bought the Delaware Western to obtain charter rights across Delaware for its new main line to Philadelphia. Diverging at West Yard Junction, the South Side Extension turned southeast and crossed the Christina River on a swing bridge in the middle of the present Wilmington riverfront. It proceeded down the platted course of C Street to a wye at Bradford Street, and ran up the latter to Christiana Avenue, crossing and running parallel to the avenue as far as the Third Street bridge over the river. A long spur ran from the wye down C Street to the edge of Christiana Avenue. The B&O; showed little interest in developing the South Side Extension, unlike the W&N;, which aggressively expanded to serve industries in South Wilmington. It did operate a carfloat service from the Third Street dock at the end of the extension to serve industries on the north side of the river; the service began before 1888 and ended in 1903. An extension of the spur along C Street across Christiana Avenue to the Christiana River would have facilitated a carfloat connection to the Central Railroad of New Jersey, but the branch on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River was never completed. The tracks beyond the wye were largely removed or abandoned in the late 1920s, and the swing bridge was taken out of service around 1930 and removed in the late 1930s. The B&O; arranged with the Reading to switch its remaining customers on the south side of the river, and continued to serve a few industries between West Yard Junction and the bridge.

The game was designed and published by TSR, Inc. under license in 1984. Ten years later, West End Games acquired the rights to publish their own Indiana Jones role-playing game, The World of Indiana Jones.  History  Publication stopped when the licensing rights to the Indiana Jones property expired. All unsold copies of the game were destroyed at that time. Employees at the UK office of TSR Hobbies mounted a portion of the burnt remains of the last copy in a small pyramid trophy made of Perspex. Beginning in 2000, the trophy became known as the \\"Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\\". A set of pewter miniatures were also marketed in 1984 for use with the game, which the player could choose to use instead of the cardboard cutouts that were provided with each book.  Setting  The setting of the game is historical, 1930's pulp era. Players can choose to set aspects of the game at any point in the mid-to-late 1930s. Some adventure packs establish a particular timeline, while others are left to the player's discretion.  System  Designed for 2 to 8 players, the game is run and scenes are laid out by a game master, called a referee. Each adventure pack specifies which of pre-made characters are available to be played, and provide a character dossier which displays their attributes, abilities, and a health chart. Provided maps, tables, and cut-out game pieces represent the setting and characters, and are used to determine character positioning, range, line of sight, and movement. =Characters= The players choose one of seven pre- made characters based on those from the movies: Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Short Round, Willie Scott, Sallah (the digger), Jock Lindsay (the pilot), or Wu Han (an old friend of Indy's). Each character has seven attributes to decide basic factors in the game: Strength (physical strength), Movement (action speed), Prowess (manual dexterity, coordination), Backbone (courage, determination), Instinct (perception, intuition), and Appeal (personality, physical attractiveness). When a particular feat is attempted, a check is made against the character's appropriate attribute by rolling a d100. Modifiers to the roll or attribute may be applied by the referee, based on game circumstances. If one rolls lower than their modified attribute score, the action is successful. If it is higher, the action fails. Outcome is determined by the referee. The character generation rules for the TSR game was introduced in the accessory pack IJAC1, Judge's Survival Guide, a year after the game was introduced. =Combat= Combat is done in turns, each of which equals five seconds of in-game time. Players with the highest movement attribute have the chance to act first with a check against that attribute. Whether one is able to land a blow depends on a check against their prowess attribute, and the amount of damage done is determined by a \\"Modified Check Table\\" provided in the game rules. There are three levels of damage: light, medium, and serious. The reversed number rolled for the prowess check, looked up on the provided \\"Action Results Table\\" determines where the blow landed, if not otherwise decided by the referee. Other forms of combat, such as shooting are done in the same way, only the provided maps must be used to determine range and line of sight. No formal system of hit points or determining actual character death is put forth, and instead is left to the referee as a role- play element. =Themes= Most of the themes of the game are centered on the movies and comics, with Indiana Jones and his companions procuring items of archeological importance, while battling Nazis, rival archeologists, violent natives, gangsters, and anything else the referee chooses to put forth in the storyline. Even in the prepared adventure packs, sequence results are largely left open to player determination based on referee guidance. Many of the modules published had no specific year in which the adventure took place; however, the setting of Temple of Doom was in 1935, and the setting of Raiders of the Lost Ark was in 1936. Material from the comic series, Further Adventures of Indiana Jones was used for plots in some of the TSR publications.

Crow commented that \\"Indiana Jones is so locked into the concept of the two movies that it is practically useless for anything outside of reenacting the movies or similar plots.

He first enrolled at Millikin University before attending Bethany College. He attended Stephen Decatur High School in Decatur, Illinois. With the Millikin Big Blue, Gepford played halfback and quarterback. In November 1919, he and teammate Roy Adkins joined the Staleys for their game against the Taylorville Independents, which the Staleys won. However, the two were exposed by Millikin head coach Norman Wann and banned from Millikin athletics for violating their amateur athlete statuses, though they were allowed to remain in school. They permanently joined the Staleys for the remainder of the year and into 1920, with Gepford playing quarterback/halfback for the football team and was a member of the basketball team. He also worked for A. E. Staley in the summer. In 1922, Gepford and Adkins enrolled at Bethany College on the advice of a former Millikin coach. As Bethany did not have rules regarding amateur eligibility, the two were also joined by players from the Staleys. During a 1923 game against Butler, Gepford suffered a concussion but continued to play. Due to the injury, he began experiencing headaches that persisted while he worked at Staley and prepared for his new job as a high school history teacher in Marion, Illinois. On September 9, 1924, he committed suicide by gunshot, which his mother attributed to his concussion (chronic traumatic encephalopathy); he is considered one of the first APFA/NFL players to die since the league's formation in 1920 and the first as a result of football-related head injuries.

It replaced the original song sung by Maria and Captain Georg von Trapp called \\"An Ordinary Couple\\". Since then the song has been used in the various reproductions of the play and most recently the 2015 television special, The Sound of Music Live. Background It was first recorded by Julie Andrews and playback singer Bill Lee (dubbing over the voice of actor Christopher Plummer)Hirsch 1993, p. 160. for the film's soundtrack and was covered by Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer on the television special's soundtrack. In The Making of The Sound of Music by Max Wilk, Wilk stated that when Robert Wise and Saul Chaplin discussed replacing \\"An Ordinary Couple\\" with Rodgers, he automatically agreed to the idea and admitted he and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II had been talking of replacing the song but Hammerstein had been too ill to do so. This was not the only song to be written for the film: another song, \\"I Have Confidence\\", was also added. Owing to the popularity of these songs in the film, both have sometimes been integrated into stage productions, with \\"Something Good\\" often replacing \\"An Ordinary Couple\\". Themes The song is a confession of love between Maria Kutschera and Captain Georg von Trapp. It appears in the film shortly after Maria returns to the house and after the Captain and Baroness Schräder have their falling out.The Sound of Music (1965 film) A 2004 article of American Music said that the song could be interpreted on two levels. The magazine asserted that on a literal level, it is a song about redemption between Maria's past (and the real woman's difficult childhood and suspicion of the Church) contrasted with the Captain's \\"loving response to her.\\" However, the article continued that the song covertly provides a \\"rationale for America's response to Salzburg\\" in the wake of Nazism—that Europe essentially had a good heart. Legacy As with the film, the song is used in The Sound of Music Live! as a confession of love between Maria and the Captain shortly after the falling out between the Captain and Baroness Schräder. It comes right after the musical number with the Captain, Baroness Schräder and Max Detweiler, \\"No Way to Stop It\\", in the broadcast.The Sound of Music Live! (2013) In a review of the production, Entertainment Weekly considered the song \\"boring\\" stating \\"This snoozefest is the musical representation of why some people say they can’t sit through Sound of Music, and that the song \\"is actually, well, bad.\\" The song was used by Elaine Stritch to close Elaine Stritch at Liberty, her one-woman, Tony Award-winning 2002 Broadway show.

After the disastrous attack on the Spanish fort, Buckland wants to sail to Kingston, but Hornblower suggests they launch a bold surprise night assault on the fort by land and then trap the Spanish ships anchored in the bay beneath the fort. Thirty-three seamen, led by Randall, desert during the night rather than serve under mutineers. Because the desertion occurred under his command, Buckland agrees to Hornblower's plan to try to salvage his reputation. The landing force, led by Hornblower, Kennedy, and Bush, discovers the deserters all dead. Hornblower concludes they were killed not by the Spanish, but the slaves who have risen up. Meanwhile, a slave leader, \\"Colonel\\" Francois Lefanu, parlays with Buckland, admitting his men mistook the deserters for Spaniards. He demands the British leave Santo Domingo, asserting this is not their fight. Due to Buckland's blundering, a firefight begins accidentally. The shots alert the Spanish. The landing party charges the fort, but is pinned down by heavy fire. Hornblower discovers a series of tunnels and leads some of the men inside; his quick thinking results in the capture of the fort. Using hot shot, the landing party then uses the fort's cannons to fire on the fleeing Spanish ships. After their victory, the British meet Colonel Francisco Manuel Ortega, the Spanish commander, who is strangely anxious to surrender the island to them. They soon discovered why; the fort is under siege by the rebel slaves, and the Spanish are starving. At Hornblower's urging, Buckland stalls for time, while a cannon is lifted up a cliff to where it can fire on the Spanish ships. Once they demonstrate that the ships are within range of the cannon, Buckland obtains an unconditional surrender. Meanwhile, Hobbs tries to free his long-time commander, Captain Sawyer, but fails. Hobbs then confronts Midshipman Wellard and accuses him of pushing Sawyer down the hold. As the Spanish are surrendering, the slaves attack the fort. While evacuating the Spanish, now prisoners of war, Buckland orders Hornblower to blow up the fort. Despite an order to the contrary, Bush and Kennedy help Hornblower get safely back. Buckland then gives him command of the Spanish ships. Later that night, however, the Spanish prisoners try to seize Renown. The attempt fails, at least partly due to Hornblower's quickly leading his crew back aboard Renown. Sawyer and Wellard are killed and Bush and Kennedy injured. The tribunal members are unimpressed by Buckland's being surprised in bed by the Spaniards and tied up in his cabin during the battle. Buckland rashly states his belief that Sawyer became mentally unstable because Hornblower pushed him into the hold. Buckland calls on Hobbs to back him, but Hobbs states he does not know. During a recess, Pellew tells Hammond and Collins that instead of hanging Hornblower, they should promote him. Later, to protect Hornblower, a dying Kennedy confesses to the tribunal that he pushed Sawyer. Commodore Pellew tells Hornblower that one of the Spanish ships has been renamed HMS Retribution and that he has been promoted to commander and is the new captain of Retribution.

(Ace, Aug 1978, ) and subsequent 1929 comic strip continuity, in which resurgent tribal Americans overthrow their Red Mongol conquerors. The basic game was called the High Adventure Cliffhangers Buck Rogers Adventure Game (Sep 1993, ) and was co-designed by Jeff Grubb and Steven Schend. The High Adventure Cliffhangers Buck Rogers War Against The Han Campaign Supplement (Dec 1993, ) was designed by Steven Schend alone. This new Buck Rogers role- playing game was a return to the themes of the original Buck Rogers comic strips. This game included biplanes and interracial warfare, as opposed to the space combat of the earlier Buck Rogers XXVC game. There were only a few expansion modules created for High-Adventure Cliffhangers. Shortly afterward, the game was discontinued, and the production of Buck Rogers RPGs and games came to an end. This game was neither widely advertised nor very popular. There were only two published products: the box set, and \\"War Against the Han\\".

Supermembranes are a generalisation of superstrings to another dimension. Supermembranes are 2-dimensional surfaces. For example, they can be spherical or shaped like a torus. As in superstring theory the vibrations of the supermembranes correspond to different particles. Supermembranes also exhibit a symmetry called supersymmetry without which the vibrations would only correspond to bosons and not fermions. Energy The energy of a classical supermembrane is given by its surface area. One consequence of this is that there is no difference between one or two membranes since two membranes can be connected by a long 1 dimensional string of zero area. Hence, the idea of 'membrane-number' has no meaning. A second consequence is that unlike strings a supermembrane's vibrations can represent several particles at once. In technical terms this means it is already 'second-quantized'. All the particles in the Universe can be thought to arise as vibrations of a single membrane. Spectrum When going from the classical theory to the quantum theory of supermembranes it is found that they can only exist in 11 dimensions, just as superstrings can only exist in 10 dimensions. When examining the energy spectrum (the allowed frequencies that a string can vibrate in) it was found that they can only be in discrete values corresponding to the masses of different particles. It has been shown: * The energy spectrum for the classical bosonic membrane is continuous. * The energy spectrum for the quantum bosonic membrane is discrete. * The energy spectrum for the quantum supermembrane is continuous. At first the discovery that the spectrum was continuous was thought to mean the theory didn't make sense. But it was realised that it meant that supermembranes actually correspond to multiple particles. (The continuous degrees of freedom corresponding to the coordinates/momenta of the additional particles). Action The action for a classical membrane is simply the surface area of the world sheet. The quantum version is harder to write down, is non-linear and very difficult to solve. Unlike the superstring action which is quadratic, the supermembrane action is quartic which makes it exponentially harder. Adding to this the fact that a membrane can represent many particles at once not much progress has been made on supermembranes. Low energy sector It has been proven that the low energy vibrations of the supermembrane correspond to the particles in 11 dimensional supergravity. Topology A supermembrane can have multiple thing tubes or strings coming out of it with little or no extra energy cost since strings, for example, have no area. This means that all orientable topologies of membranes are physically the same. Also, joined and disjointed supermembranes are physically the same. Thus the topology of a supermembrane has no physical meaning. Mathematics The infinite supermembrane can be described in terms of an infinite number of patches. The coordinates of (each patch of) a supermembrane at any casual slice of time are 11 dimensional and depend on two continuous parameters (\\\\sigma,\\\\theta) and a third integer parameter (k) denoting the patch number: :X^k_\\\\mu(\\\\sigma,\\\\theta) = x^k_\\\\mu + O(\\\\sigma,\\\\theta) Therefore the super membrane can describe an infinite number of particles if we associate somehow the coordinate of each particle with some topological property of the patches - perhaps holes in the membrane or closed loops. Supermembrane Field Theory Since supermembranes correspond to multiple particles the field theory of membranes correspond to a Fock space. Informally, let a(x) denote the continuous degrees of freedom in the energy spectrum: :\\\\Phi[X] = \\\\Phi[x,\\\\mathbf{a},..] = \\\\phi(x) + \\\\int \\\\mathbf{a}(y) \\\\phi(x,y) dy + \\\\int \\\\mathbf{a}(y)\\\\mathbf{a}(z) \\\\phi(x,y,z)dydz + ... The action can be written as : S = \\\\int \\\\Phi[X] \\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\Phi[X] D[X] where Q is the kinetic operator. No interaction terms are needed since there is no concept of membrane number. Everything is the same membrane. The action is not quite the same type as the one for superstrings or particles since it involves terms with multiple particles. The terms relating to single fields must recover the classical field equations of Dirac, Maxwell and Einstein. The propagator to get from a state with membrane X to one at another conformal slice with membrane Y is: : G(X,Y) = \\\\mathbf{Q^{-1}}(X,Y) And since each membrane corresponds to any number of identical particles this is equivalent to all the Green's functions for many particle collisions at once! Although it looks like a lot of things simplify in the supermembrane picture, the actual form of the kinetic operator Q is yet unknown and must be a very complicated operator acting on an infinite Fock-like space. Hence the seeming simplicity of the theory is hidden in this operator. Cosmology Since the vibrations of a supermembrane of infinite energy can correspond to every particle in the Universe at once it is possible to interpret the supermembrane as equivalent to the Universe. i.e. all that exists is the supermembrane. It makes no difference to say we live on this supermembrane or that we are in 11 dimensional space-time. Every state of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane and every history of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane world volume. What we think of as space-time coordinates can equally be thought of as vector fields on the 2+1 dimensional supermembrane. For a supermembrane moving at the speed of light, its world volume can be zero due to the metric (+++-). Thus the Big Bang can be thought of as a spherical membrane expanding at the speed of light. This has interesting interpretations in terms of the holographic principle. Geometry Because the supermembrane(s) correspond to all particles at a particular causal time slice, it also corresponds to all the gravitons particles (which are particular vibrational modes). Thus the geometry of the 2+1D supermembrane contains within it the description of the geometry of the (macroscopic) 10+1D space-time. But as it is a quantum theory it gives probabilities for different space-times consistent with observation. The different space-times may only differ microscopically whereas the macroscopic space-time is smooth. In other words, the geometry of the membrane determines the geometry of (macroscopic) space-time. This is different from string theory where only condensates of many separate strings can macroscopically determine the space-time. Super-5-branes M-Theory and 11D supergravity also predict 5+1D objects called super-5-branes. An alternative cosmological theory is that we live on one of these branes. Compactification Compactifying one space-time dimension on a circle and wrapping the membrane around this circle gives us superstring theory. To get back to our 3+1 dimensional universe the space-time coordinates need to be compactified on a 7 dimensional manifold (of G2 holonomy). Not much is known about these types of shapes. Matrix Theory Matrix theory is a particular way of formulating supermembrane theory. It is still in development. The diagonal entries of an infinite dimensional matrix can be thought of as different supermembranes (parts) connected by 1 dimensional strings. References *J.

Under him, JMU appeared in three NCAA Tournaments. A 1976 graduate of Hillsdale College, McFarland served as an assistant coach at several schools in the late 1970s and 1980s. Playing career A native of New Carlisle, Ohio, McFarland attended Tecumseh High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He then played football and baseball at Michigan's Hillsdale College. After graduating in spring 1976, he spent training camp with the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders before starting his coaching career the following year. Coaching career =Junior college and assistant coaching= McFarland's first coaching position was an assistant job at Hillsdale in 1977. He next served as the head coach at Kellogg Community College, also in Michigan, from 1979 to 1980. His overall record at Kellogg was 33-13. McFarland then spent a decade as an assistant in the southeast, coaching at Appalachian State (1981), Florida State (1982), Georgia Tech (1983–1985), and South Florida (1986–1990). =Northern Illinois= McFarland's first Division I head coaching job came at Northern Illinois (NIU) from 1991 to 1997. There, McFarland revived a program that had been cut in the early 1980s. He had a 146-211 record in seven seasons. After playing 1991 as an independent, NIU played in the Mid-Continent Conference from 1992 to 1994. The team finished in the bottom three of the conference in all three seasons, with its highest win total coming in 1994 (23-30). From 1995 to 1997, it played in the Horizon League and qualified for the conference tournament in each season. In 1995, it had its first above-.500 season under McFarland (29-27), finished second in the West Division, and placed third in the Horizon Tournament. The Huskies' Jesse Richardson was named the Horizon Player of the Year. In 1996, it won the Horizon Tournament but lost to Northeastern Illinois in the NCAA Tournament play-in game. At NIU, four of McFarland's players were selected in the MLB Draft, including 7th-round selection Chris Burt in 1994. Another of his players, Brian Schmack, went undrafted but later pitched in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers. =James Madison= After the 1997 season, McFarland left Northern Illinois to become the head coach at James Madison. He replaced Kevin Anderson, who had resigned following allegations that he overstated spending on team meals. The Dukes' first winning season under McFarland came in 2000, his third season, when they went 37-22. After another 30-win season in 2001, the Dukes qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 2002. After a 41-12 regular season in which they won the CAA's American Division and McFarland was named CAA Coach of the Year, they went 2-2 in the CAA Tournament. After receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as the third seed in the Columbia Regional, they went 1-2, getting a win against VCU in an elimination game. After missing the CAA Tournament in 2004 and 2005, the Dukes went 38-21 in 2006 and won the CAA regular season title. They finished third in the CAA Tournament, however, and did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. McFarland's best four- year stretch at James Madison came from 2008 to 2011. In this stretch, the Dukes had three 30-win seasons and a 40-win season. They won two CAA regular season titles (2010 and 2011) and appeared in two NCAA Tournaments (2008 and 2011). In 2008, at the Raleigh Regional, the Dukes again went 1-2 with a win in the 0-1 game. In 2010, the team won the regular season title but lost in the tournament; McFarland was named the CAA's Co-Coach of the Year. In 2011, they reached the Chapel Hill Regional final in their deepest postseason run under McFarland. James Madison had losing records in 2012, 2013, and 2014, finishing no higher than 6th in the CAA. At James Madison, McFarland has had many major award winners and draftees. CAA award winners include Players of the Year Eddie Kim (2002 and 2003), Kellen Kulbacki (2006), and Jake Lowery (2011). Kulbacki was named a First-Team All-American in both 2006 and 2007. Between 1998 and 2014, 28 of his players have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. Rich Thompson, Dan Meyer, and Ryan Reid went on to appear in Major League Baseball. In the fall of 2014, McFarland announced that he would retire after the 2015 season. That year, the Dukes finished 18-33 and missed the CAA Tournament. Personal life McFarland's son, Ty, played for him at James Madison from 2011 to 2014. He was a 10th-round selection of the New York Yankees in the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft.

Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche (March 25, 1825 – February 5, 1905), commonly known by his middle name, was a German trade unionist and socialist politician who was elected a member of the Reichstag. He was a founder and President of the General German Cigar Workers' Union (ADZV) in 1865. The subject of police persecution for his radical political views, in 1881 Fritzsche emigrated to the United States of America, where he edited the newspaper the Philadelphia Tageblatt for a time before retiring from politics. Biography =Early years= Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, known to his family and friends as Wilhelm, was born in Leipzig, in the Kingdom of Saxony, one of the German States, on March 25, 1825. His father, Wilhelm Fritzsche, was a journeyman shoemaker.Graham Ford, \\"Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 327-328. Fritzsche was forced to work from an early age, taking his first job as a cigarmaker in 1840 at the age of 15. =Political career= Fritzsche became politically active late in the 1840s.Anne Spier, \\"German-Speaking Peoples,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 3: Migrants from Southern and Western Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 513. In 1849 Fritzsche was arrested for his participation in the 1848 Revolution in the city of Dresden. Fritzsche was a founding member of the Leipzig Educational Association in February 1861 and together with Julius Vahlteich split away from that group the following year to form a new workers' organization called Vorwärts (Forward). With the establishment of the General German Workers' Association (ADAV) in May 1863, Fritzche became a founding member of that organization and was elected to the organization's governing Executive Committee. He would become Vice President of the ADAV in 1865 and briefly served as President of that organization in November 1865. The November 30, 1865 General Meeting of the ADAV voted a motion of no confidence in Fritzsche's leadership and he returned to Leipzig, resigning both his Vice Presidency and his position as the organization's official representative in that city. Fritzsche subsequently turned his attention to trade union organization, serving as one of the principals establishing the General German Cigar Workers' Union (ADZV), of which he was President from 1865 until 1878. Fritzche also became a newspaper editor for the first time in this period, producing the weekly paper of the union, Der Botschafter, from 1866 until its ban by the authorities in 1879. In July 1868 Fritzsche was elected to the North German regional Reichstag. Disagreement with the leadership of Johann Baptist von Schweitzer led him to leave the ADAV in the summer of 1869. While Fritzsche was a delegate to the founding congress of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) in August 1869, he does not seem to have been a member of the new organization, instead rejoining the ADAV in 1872. Whatever his misgivings about membership in the SDAP, Fritzsche emerged as a leading voice in favor of unity of the two organizations, and he was selected as a delegate to the Unity Congress held at Gotha. The Gotha Congress resulted in the formation of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD), forerunner of the modern Social-Democratic Party of Germany. In 1877 and 1878, Fritzche was elected a member of the Reichstag on the ticket of the Socialist Workers' Party, in which he remained a member until his emigration to America in 1881. Frizsche found himself expelled from Berlin in 1879 after passage of the Anti-Socialist Laws. He returned to Leipzig and established a new newspaper there called Der Wanderer (The Wanderer). He was dispatched to London and America for the first time in 1880, where he spoke on behalf of the Socialist Workers' Party, attempting to build international support for the German socialist movement. =Newspaper editor in America= Harassed constantly by the authorities, Fritzche emigrated to America in 1881, settling in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he edited the labor newspaper the Philadelphia Tageblatt (Philadelphia Daily News). =Later years= After his time editing the Tageblatt, Fritzsche retired from politics to life as an innkeeper in Philadelphia. =Death and legacy= Fritzsche died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States on February 5, 1905, aged 79.

It took place on August 17, 2014, at Arena Ciudad de México in Mexico City, Mexico. The event was the twenty-second annual Triplemanía, which is AAA's biggest show of the year, airing in Mexico as a regular PPV and internationally as an internet pay-per-view (iPPV). This was the first AAA PPV event to be broadcast simultaneously in English through SAP, having Hugo Savinovich and Vampiro as announcers. Alberto Del Rio, who was fired from WWE more than a week prior, made an appearance at the event. WWE wrestler Rey Mysterio also appeared in a video package to end the show. Jeff Jarrett and Ricochet were advertised for the event, but both missed the event due to travel issues. Production =Background= In early 1992 Antonio Peña was working as a booker and storyline writer for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to lucha libre. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for \\"Assistance, Consulting, and Administration\\" later renamed AAA). After making a deal with the Televisa television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992. The following year Peña and AAA held their first Triplemanía event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's Super Bowl event, similar to the WWE's WrestleMania being the biggest show of the year. The 2014 Triplemanía was the 22nd year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 26th overall show under the Triplemanía banner. In February 2014, it was announced that Triplemanía XXII would be held in the Arena Ciudad de México in Mexico City, Mexico, for the third consecutive year; this would be the eighth time that Mexico City would host Triplemanía. There were multiple options to watch Triplemanía XXII: via traditional pay-per-view on the SKY television service at $229 (Mexican peso) for standard-definition and $298 for high-definition, or via Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) at $194. This would be the seventh year Triplemanía would be available through SKY. The iPPV was available on AAA's official website, www.luchalibreaaa.com. This was the promotion's first iPPV in a year after problems arose when Triplemanía XXI was shown on iPPV. =Storylines= The Triplemanía XXII show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. AAA frequently has eight person tag team matches open their major events, usually featuring on each team a high-flying wrestler, a female luchadora, an exótico (in drag) and a Mini-Estrella. The opening match for Triplemanía XXII featured two feuds, one between former team-mates of the Real Fuerza Aérea faction, Aero Star and Súper Fly, and another feud between Pimpinela Escarlata and Mamba. The second match on the card had a complicated buildup. Bengala won an elimination match to become the number one contender to Daga's AAA Cruiserweight Championship. However, after AAA Fusión Champion Fenix pinned Daga in a six-man tag team match, Fenix also wanted to challenge for Daga's title, and he was willing to put his own title on the line at the same time. Daga agreed to the title challenges, after-which a multi-man elimination match to unify the AAA Cruiserweight and AAA Fusión Championship was set up for Triplemanía XXII, with several other wrestlers added to the match as well; those being Angélico, Australian Suicide, El Hijo del Fantasma, Jack Evans, Joe Líder, Pentagón Jr and Ricochet. The third match, for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship, was set up when Taya won a number one contender elimination match in June 2014 over Cynthia Moreno, La Jarochita, La Magnifica, Mari Apache, Sexy Lady and Sexy Star. Taya was described to have been feuding with champion Faby Apache \\"for quite some time\\". The fourth match, where the last wrestler to escape the cage would lose his mask or hair, had little buildup. The storyline leading into the match was Jeff Jarrett's rivalry against Mexican wrestlers. Blue Demon Jr, Electro Shock and La Parka represented the técnicos of Ejercito AAA, while Averno, Chessman and Jarrett being the rudos. To set up the match, Jarrett attacked Electro Shock with a guitar and drew blood in Querétaro in June 2014. The four-way match originally promoted as second to the main event was for the Copa Triplemanía XXII, and also featured little buildup. This would be Myzteziz's first major event for AAA since his in-ring debut, and he would once again face one of his hottest rivals, Perro Aguayo Jr. AAA announced a surprise entrant for the match, which was revealed as Dr. Wagner Jr. in his return to the promotion. Wagner Jr. started a rivalry with the final entrant, Cibernético, heading into the match. For the match originally promoted as the main event, the feud between Psycho Clown and Texano Jr. began due to the rivalry between their respective factions, Los Psycho Circus and El Consejo. Psycho Clown had twice challenged for Texano Jr's AAA Mega Championship, but lost twice due to the referees cheating on behalf of Texano Jr. Despite the AAA Mega Championship not being on the line at Triplemanía XXII, the meeting of the duo was described as \\"the ultimate match of respect between luchadors\\" due to the Lucha de Apuestas conditions, where the loser must forfeit his hair (for Texano Jr) or his mask (for Psycho Clown). The feud was seen as a continuation of the historical feud between Los Brazos and Los Misioneros de la Muerte, as Psycho Clown is a descendant of Brazo de Plata of the Alvarado Nieves generation, while Texano Jr. is the son of El Texano. Alberto Del Rio was fired by WWE on August 7, 2014, with the promotion citing his \\"unprofessional conduct and an altercation with an employee\\". Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer reported that \\"the story going around\\" was that Del Rio had slapped a manager of social media. Del Rio later said that he reacted to what he felt was a racist comment by a fellow employee by demanding an apology. When the employee responded by smiling, Del Rio slapped him. Del Rio was later ashamed of his reaction but vowed to uphold his own dignity. Additionally, WWE's Twitter account released a message stating that Del Rio \\"is responsible for his own actions. If you're angry at anyone, be angry at Alberto. There's no excuse for a pro athlete not to conduct themselves in a professional manner.\\" Less than a week after the firing, Del Rio was announced to appear at Triplemanía XXII, but not wrestle, due to a 90-day non-compete clause imposed by WWE. Del Rio previously took part in Triplemanía X in 2002, as Dos Caras Jr. Event Triplemanía began with the returning Alberto Del Rio, billed as El Patron Alberto talking about his departure from WWE and the racism within it, before he was interrupted by Konnan and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo A physical altercation occurred starting with El Patron's father, Dos Caras, being assaulted, but El Patron fended off the attackers. In another non-match event, the AAA Hall of Fame welcomed new inductees El Brazo and Rayo de Jalisco Sr.; with the ceremony being interrupted by El Hjo del Perro Aguayo. Meanwhile, Jeff Jarett and Ricochet both missed the event despite being slated to wrestle, with both apologizing for having problems with their airline providers. Aero Star's team won the opening match when Mascarita Sagrada submitted Mini Abismo Negro. The order of elimination for the second match was firstly Drago (substituting for Ricochet), Jack Evans, Joe Lider, Australian Suicide, Bengala, Pentagon Jr, (AAA Fusión Champion) Fenix and then (AAA Cruiserweight Champion) Daga. Finally, Hijo del Fantasma used a variant of a piledriver on Angelico to win the match and the new AAA World Cruiserweight Championship. The third match saw Taya defeating Fabi Apache to capture Apache's AAA Reina de Reinas Championship after a Northern Lights suplex, a stomp variant, and help from rudo referee Hijo del Tirantes. The match was described as \\"full of screwiness\\" due to Tirantes, Sexy Star and Hijo del Fantasma. Valkyrie, the first foreigner to win this title, suffered a broken nose in this match. The fourth match saw Electroshock losing his hair as he lost a steel cage match when El Mesias (substituting for Jeff Jarrett, in his return after a near-eight month absence) escaped the cage after using a double knee backbreaker from the top rope on Electroshock. Prior to that, the order of escape was first La Parka Jr, then Averno, Blue Demon Jr, and Chessman. The match was described as \\"a total bloodbath full of wild spots\\". The fifth match resulted in Texano Jr.being shaved of his hair in the ring after losing to Psycho Clown, who pinned him after a Canadian Destroyer of the top rope through a table. Texano Jr.enjoyed help from Rafael \\"El Maya\\" and Hijo del Fantasma, forcing AAA's commissioner Fantasma to expel them from the ringside area. The match was described as \\"another bloodbath full of table spots and unprotected chair shots to the head\\". AAA described the result being that Psycho Clown \\"rompió la maldición de los Alvarado\\" (broke the curse of Alvarado). The feud ended with a handshake between the duo. The main event four-way elimination match saw blood from Dr Wagner Jr.and Mysteziz. Cibernetico eliminated Dr Wagner Jr.first after a chokeslam. Then, Mysteziz submitted Cibernetico by applying La Mistica. Finally, Perro Aguayo Jr.low blowed Mysteziz to win the Copa Triplemanía XXII. After the match, El Patron stormed the ring to brawl with Perro Aguayo Jr; with El Patron emerging from the brawl dominant. The show ended with a video of Rey Mysterio (still contracted to WWE at the time) stating that he would return to AAA \\"soon\\". Reception 21,000 people attended the event in the Arena Ciudad de México. Josh Boutwell of wrestleview.com praised the opener as \\"very good\\", the Cruiserweight title match as \\"a great, high flying match with tons of action\\", and the Mask vs. Hair match as \\"awesome\\". However, Boutwell was critical of the cage match as \\"a disaster from the start\\" and the commentators including Vampiro, which Boutwell described as \\"one of the worst commentators in the history of wrestling\\". Lastly, Boutwell blasted the iPPV's \\"horrible stream\\" where he \\"was never able to see more than 1 minute uninterrupted of the stream before [he] gave up on the live show. It is beyond pathetic that after an entire year from the horrible disaster of last year's TripleMania stream this happens.\\" Adrián López of ESPN.com gave his views on some of the matches, stating that the main event showed the hatred between the competitors, while the penultimate match was an epic struggle and the women's match was dramatic, vibrant and exciting. Aftermath Triplemanía XXII was Perro Aguayo Jr's final Triplemanía event, as he died in late March 2015 at the age of 35. Aguayo Jr. died after wrestling a match in Tijuana, Mexico for a promotion called The Crash; he was teaming with Manik against Extreme Tiger and Rey Mysterio Jr. Initial reports stated that the cause of death was cervical spine trauma at the neck. El Patrón Alberto had his first return match for AAA on September 14, 2014 in a six-man tag match, teaming with La Parka and Myzteziz to defeat Averno, Perro Aguayo Jr.and Texano Jr. On December 7, 2014 at Guerra de Titanes, Alberto defeated Texano Jr.to win the AAA Mega Championship. Also at Guerra de Titanes, Aero Star defeated Super Fly and thus forced him to unmask; Super Fly's real name was revealed as Erick Aguilar Muñoz. It was announced in early March 2015 that Rey Mysterio Jr. had joined AAA; he would have his return match for AAA later that month. After losing his hair, Electroshock teased retiring from professional wrestling. However, Electroshock instead went to form a new faction in 2015 called Holocausto, this group included El Hijo de Pirata Morgan.

In the 19th century, Antonio Niccolini also worked on its reconstruction when it became known as Palazzo Cocozza, and housed the Cardinal Niccolò Coscia, the brother of Duke Baldassarre Coscia. Subsequent members of the aristocratic family ended up selling portions of the palace, until the last member left in 1812. In 1812, it became the offices of the Ministry of War and Navy. The name Partanna originated from the Duchess of Floridia, Lucia Migliaccio, widow of Benedetto Grifeo, Prince of Partanna, who became the morganatic wife of the widowed Ferdinand IV of Naples. She lived in this palace till she moved to the Palazzo San Giacomo (now City Hall) in Piazza Municipio. It was damaged by the bombing during World War II.

Bland returned to Mississippi and began employment as the Human Resources Director and Marketing Director with the G.A. Carmichael Family Health Center. Bland came to Meridian to own and operate a State Farm Insurance Agency. Bland continues to run and manage a very successful insurance Agency. Community involvement In 2007, Bland served as co-chair to pass a bond issue for the first major renovations and improvements to Meridian’s public schools in more than 20 years. The bond issue was for $19.5 million. The bond issue passed on March 27, 2007 with 71.3%. Bland also helped establish the Magnolia Youth Sports Association and still runs his own Summer Basketball Camp. Bland helped establish the First Tee Golf Program in Meridian, the first in the state, a golf program aimed at improving the quality of life of primarily inner-city children. Mayor of Meridian On June 4, 2013, Percy Bland won the election for mayor of Meridian by 54% of the vote. Before he took office, Bland formed a 29-member transition team from the community to study five issues - education, community development, public safety, infrastructure and city partnerships - and make recommendations about how to more improve those areas in Meridian. Bland was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of the city of Meridian on July 1, 2013. During the first Meridian City Council meeting of the new administration, on July 2, 2014, Bland proposed his livable wage policy. Bland proposed a $9 an hour minimum salary for all city employees that was to be funded by money saved through cuts to other areas of the municipal budget. Bland's livable wage proposal became city policy when the city council passed the municipal budget on September 17, 2013. Bland and several local businesses began recognizing an outstanding teacher or staff member from two MPSD schools a month during the 2013-14 school year. Improvements to public safety were made to the newly annexed part of Meridian through a new warning siren at the recently constructed fire station in that area. Meridian youth sports were brought together through one comprehensive program in the Meridian Parks and Recreation Department. The program brought in more mentors, more coaches, and more churches as partners for the City of Meridian to work with youth through athletics. In May 2014, the City of Meridian pledged $750,000 to help build a new community center. In May 2014, the City of Meridian launched a series of new programs to help fight crime in the city, including a new gang task force, a new team of Meridian police officers and citizens to help with tips on crime, and penalizing parents when their children do not comply with the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law. In June 2014, Bland built a team to bring a new airline carrier to Meridian. American Airlines the largest airline carrier in the world brings their service to Meridian under the American Eagle brand. Express Jet will operate the service for American Airlines. In September 2014, Bland began a mayor's initiative to raise awareness of school attendance and the dangers of dropping out of high school. Through his Mayor's Youth Council, Bland created a public service announcement that emphasized issues that high school students face, such as bullying, drugs, and depression. In October 2014, Bland launched his Kidz Zone Initiative, a program that partnered the City of Meridian with city and county schools, both local and private, to strengthen families. On the second Saturday of each month Disney movies are shown at the Meridian Temple Theatre for $2. The program encourages fathers to play an active role within their children's lives. All fathers are allowed free admission to the movie. Also in October 2014, Bland started a \\"Senior Prom\\" initiative to engage senior citizens and provide more community activities for that population. On October 6, 2014, Bland received a letter from Governor Phil Bryant that stated Meridian has been approved for a $600,000 Community Development Block Grant to help fund a new community center in the city's east end that would accommodate up to 400 children. On January 26, 2015, Bland and Choctaw Tribal Chief Phyliss J. Anderson signed an agreement to restore public transportation in Meridian. The Choctaw Regional Transportation Facility operates in more than a dozen counties in Mississippi. The bus that will be used in Meridian is handicap accessible, and can seat up to 29 people. People will have to call a special number to make arrangements to be picked up and dropped off at sites. On September 2, 2015, Bland, in cooperation with Commissioner Dick Hall, of Mississippi Department of Transportation, and Meridian Public Schools officials, opened a federally funded Safe Routes to Schools bridge at TJ Harris Lower Elementary School. On February 2, 2016, city officials unanimously approved a resolution that authorized and directed the issuance of general obligation bonds for $7.5 million. The bonds will provide funds for the construction, improvement, and paving of streets, sidewalks, driveways, parkways, walkways, bridges and culverts, public parking facilities, and other municipal projects.http://www.meridianms.org/default/assets/file/minutes/2016/2-02-2016-minutes.pdf On May 18, 2016, Meridian city officials, along with community members and leaders, held a groundbreaking ceremony for Velma Young Community Center. The $2 million project is the first project that brought together the City of Meridian, Lauderdale County, Meridian Housing Authority, and East Mississippi Development for a predominately African-American project. \\"This has been an under-served area for a number of years, and this community center right here is going to be a huge shot in the arm for this community,\\" said Mayor Percy Bland. On July 5, 2016, Mayor Bland and the Meridian City Council passed a resolution and ordinance setting a date of August 16, 2016 for a referendum of a two percent (2%) food and beverage levy at restaurants within the city of Meridian. Revenue from the levy will fund the construction, equipment, furnishings, and operation of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center.http://www.meridianms.org/default/assets/File/Minutes/2016/7-05-2016-minutes.pdf The referendum passed with 68.2 percent. On June 6, 2017, Mayor Bland won a second term against two opponents, Independent Dustin Markham and Republican William Compton. Mayor Bland received 64 percent of the vote, Markham received 34 percent, and Compton received 2 percent.

The original story and screenplay were written by Richard Macaulay and Jerry Wald, and the film includes songs with music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Johnny Mercer, as well as music adapted from Bach, Beethoven, Liszt, Mozart, Robert Schumann, and Wagner. Ann Sheridan did her own singing in the film, except for song \\"In a Moment of Weakness\\", in which she was dubbed by Vera Van. Plot Professor Donald Hardwick (Dick Powell), who lectures his students against swing music and jitterbugging, goes to New York City to get his symphony published, but accidentally writes a hit swing song (\\"Hooray for Spinach, Hooray for Milk\\") with the connivance of aspiring lyricist Linda McKay (Gale Page), which brings him into disrepute with the Dean of his college (Halliwell Hobbes). After the teetotaling professor accidentally gets drunk, Hardwick promises to stay in New York City for the summer and write songs with McKay, and they have three more hits. Unfortunately, singer Zelda Manion (Ann Sheridan) exploits his talents to her own advantage by getting Hardwick drunk again, and tricking him into signing a contract with her publisher. His new lyricist, Joe Dirk (Allen Jenkins), gets Hardwick in trouble by copying a classical piece of music and signing Hardwick's name to it. At Hardwick's trial, his aunts (Helen Broderick, ZaSu Pitts, Vera Lewis and Elizabeth Dunne) convince the judge (Granville Bates), a songwriter himself, that the earlier melody was copied from an even earlier piece now in the public domain, and the judge throws the case out.

In a career that exceeded six decades, he wrote and illustrated well over 100 books. He was the recipient of more than 25 literary awards.  Early life  Glen Rounds was born in a sod house near Wall, South Dakota in 1906, in a region known as the South Dakota Badlands. When he was a year old, he and his family traveled in a covered wagon to Montana, where he grew up on a ranch. During his youth, he worked at many odd jobs, including baker, cook, sign painter, sawmill worker, cowboy, mule skinner, logger, ranch hand, and carnival medicine man.  Training as an artist  Rounds took an interest in art from a young age, making frequent sketches of characters and scenes from his daily life. He pursued formal training in painting and drawing at the Kansas City Art Institute from 1926 to 1927, and at the Art Students League of New York from 1930 to 1931. During this formative period, he spent a summer touring the Western United States together with Jackson Pollock, a fellow art student, and Thomas Hart Benton, their teacher at the Art Students League. Rounds and Pollock both served as models for Benton's painting The Ballad of the Jealous Lover of Lone Green Valley, 1933–1934.Mazow, Leo G. (2012). Thomas Hart Benton and the American Sound. Penn State University Press. . Rounds spent much of the early 1930s visiting publishers in New York City in an attempt to convince editors to give him work as an illustrator. Vernon Ives, who worked at Holiday House, the publisher that would eventually publish Rounds' first book, later remarked that his initial impression of Rounds was of \\"a young, footloose westerner with a discerning eye, a quick, sketchy style of drawing that had enormous vitality, and a tongue even more facile than his brush.\\"  Career as an author and illustrator  Through these persistent efforts to win the attention of publishers, Rounds unintentionally developed a reputation as a gifted storyteller, to the extent that editors eventually advised him to create an artistic opportunity for himself by writing a story collection that he could also illustrate. The result was Ol' Paul, the Mighty Logger (1936), an anthology of Paul Bunyan stories that Rounds later admitted he had largely invented. The book appeared to rave reviews: Kirkus Reviews praised the \\"virility of the [book's] line illustrations\\" and its \\"homespun look\\", summing it up as \\"a book to read aloud\\". After the success of Ol' Paul, the Mighty Logger, Rounds had a steady stream of work, both as an author and illustrator of his own books and as an illustrator for the work of others, for the rest of his life. Rounds published a wide variety of fiction and non-fiction, all of it written for an audience of children and young adults. In The Blind Colt (1941), he introduced the character of Whitey, a young Montana cowboy, who would eventually appear in eleven books published from 1941 to 1963. Another semi-autobiographical character, Mr. Yowder, the itinerant sign painter, would be featured in six books published in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of Rounds' other works focus on his attentive eye for the natural world, including several books that deal with the wildlife and environment of the Great Plains (where he had spent his youth) or of North Carolina (where he settled after the Second World War). Clues to the appeal of Rounds storytelling were given by Pat Parker in Language Arts magazine: \\"Rounds draws children, women, men and the ever- present dogs surrounded by space, suggesting frugality and human frailty in a land of awesome size; at the same time he adds subtle, sly, comic touches for real-life atmosphere.\\" Late in his career, Rounds struggled with arthritic pain in his right arm. In 1989 this condition had grown too severe for him to continue illustrating, so at the age of 83, Rounds taught himself to draw with his left hand, and resumed his work as an illustrator. Reviewers continued to praise both his writing and his artistry: his last book, Beavers (1999), was praised by a Horn Book reviewer as \\"a model of how to convey a wealth of information in just a few clear, well-phrased sentences,\\" and his illustrations were compared to the patient work of a beaver building a dam, seeming \\"aimless when taken stick by stick or line by line, but wonderfully effective in sum\\".  Awards and honors  Rounds was the recipient of over 25 awards for writing and illustrating. His first book, Ol' Paul, the Mighty Logger, was in the inaugural class of Lewis Carroll Shelf Award winners in 1958, and other titles by Rounds received the award again in 1960, 1969, 1973, 1976, and 1978.\\"Glen (Harold) Rounds (1906-).\\" Something about the Author. Ed. by Alan Hedblad. Vol. 112. Detroit: Gale Group, 2000. Pp. 160–164. Rounds received the Kerlan Award for children's literature in 1980, and the North Carolina Award for literature in 1981. He was also the recipient of the Parents' Choice Award and The New York Times Outstanding Book Award. The North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame inducted him as an honoree in 2002, the year of his death, calling Rounds \\"the last of the great 'Ring-Tailed Roarers'\\".  Personal life  Rounds served in the United States Army from 1941 to 1945 in the coast artillery and infantry, attaining the rank of staff sergeant. Rounds married three times. He married his first wife, Janet Barber, in December 1927; they divorced in 1937. He married his second wife, Margaret Olmsted, in January 1938; they remained married until her death in December 1968. He married his third wife, Elizabeth High, in 1989; she died in June 2002. Rounds died on September 27, 2002 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, at the age of 96. He was survived by one son, William, and two granddaughters.

The highways run concurrently for their entire existence within the state. The joint highway runs around Fort Defiance in Cairo, from the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge over the Mississippi River east to the Cairo Ohio River Bridge over the Ohio River; the Ohio River Bridge also carries US 51\\\\. The bridges cross the two rivers just north of the mouth of the Ohio. Route description US 51/US 60/US 62 cross the Ohio River and land in Cairo near Fort Defiance US 60/US 62 enters Illinois via the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge, a narrow, through truss bridge. The bridge deposits the highway onto a viaduct which rises above farmland in the alluvial plain. At the northern end of the causeway is the entrance to Fort Defiance Park, a former Civil War military post and later state park. Fort Defiance marks the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and Illinois' southernmost and lowest points. The lone intersection for US 60/US 62 is with US 51, which joins from the north. The three highway designations come together to head northeast and rise onto the Cairo Ohio River Bridge and into Kentucky. The Great River Road's National Route overlaps US 60/US 62 from the intersection with US 51 to the Kentucky state line. History Until the Mississippi River Bridge opened , US 60 used a ferry directly from Bird's Point, Missouri, across that river (below the Ohio) to Wickliffe, Kentucky. After that it ran into Cairo and used a ferry from roughly 22nd Street to East Cairo, Kentucky. US 62 was designated around 1930, and the Ohio River Bridge replaced the ferry in 1937. Originally, the Mississippi River bridge opened in 1929. It was a boon to economies of Southeast Missouri and Northern Arkansas. The toll drivers would have had to pay on the Mississippi bridge was $1.40 (). Meanwhile, the Ohio River bridge was delayed. An Act of Congress gave them more time. It was eventually dedicated on November 11, 1938, and made toll free exactly ten years later. It had a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $ in ).

He was descended from a Hakka family that had settled in Yining (now Xiushui), Jiangxi Province [Kowallis, p. 169]. His father was Chen Baozhen, Qing dynasty governor of Hunan. Along with Zheng Xiaoxu and Shen Zengzhi, he became one of the leading figures of the Tongguang school, which was related to but not identical with the Song poetry style [Kowallis, pp. 168–208]. From 1889 Chen Sanli served as a civil servant, and with his father Chen Baozhen (1831-1900), the governor-general of Hunan and an associate of Tan Sitong and Kang Youwei, he led local reform in Hunan, which became a model in the minds of reformists for the entire country. After the Empress Dowager suppressed the Hundred Days Reform of 1898, the Chens were forced to leave the government and go into internal exile near Nanchang. His father died shortly thereafter, which greatly saddened the son. He then moved to a villa he built outside Jinling (Nanjing) called Sanyuan Jingshe (The Sanyuan Retreat), from which Chen Sanli derived his pen-name. After the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, Chen Sanli declined to serve in government under the Republic, but he was not a Qing yilao [loyalist] in the classic sense. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, he is said to have committed suicide by starvation in protest at the Japanese invasion. Chen Yan, the main theorist of the poetics of the Tongguang school, characterized Chen Sanli's poetry as \\"obscure and profound\\" (). Chen Sanli was said to have learned from the Northern Song poet Huang Tingjian, but he did not imitate, he developed this style [Kowallis, p. 194]. Many of Chen's poems reflect the chaos and suffering of the Chinese people during the early 20th century. Chen Shizeng, One of Chen Sanli's sons became a famous painter. Another, the historian Chen Yinke, was an eminent authority on Buddhism and the institutional history of Tang-era China [Lo and Schultz, p. 351]. Further reading Kowallis, Jon Eugene von.

The Palazzo San Giacomo is now the municipio or city hall of Naples. Another church of San Giacomo degli Spagnoli is found in Rome. The original church was commissioned in 1540 by the Spanish viceroy Don Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca and associated with the adjacent hospital for the poor. The church was dedicated to St James, the patron saint of Spain, and designed by Ferdinando Manlio. The construction of the Palazzo San Giacomo did away with the facade, but retained the internal layout of three naves and a tall central ceiling. The interior still retains a number of monumental tombs, including for the viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo, his wife and son, sculpted in 1570 by Giovanni da Nola. Near the entrance are two sculptures by Francesco Cassano. In addition the tomb of Ferdinando Maiorca and his wife Porzia Coniglia in the apse was completed by Michelangelo Naccherino.

She set up The Limerick Lace School and Clare Embroidery. Early life Florence Vere O'Brien was born Florence Mary Arnold in Bayswater, London, on 3 July 1854. She was the second of four children of William Delafield Arnold and Frances Anne Arnold (née Hodgson). Her father was the son of Thomas Arnold and brother of the poet Matthew Arnold. He served in the Indian army from 1850, later being appointed in the civil service becoming director of public instruction in Punjab in 1856. When Frances Anne Arnold died in India in March 1858, the children were sent back to England in January 1859 by ship by their father. He intended on joining them in England, but during the journey overland he became seriously ill and died in Gibraltar on 9 April 1859. The children were raised by their aunt Jane (née Arnold) and William Edward Forster, becoming so close that the children formally decided to adopt the name Arnold-Forster when the youngest sister, Frances, came of age in 1878. From a young age, O'Brien was an avid letter writer, diarist and artist, who travelled from age 14 around continental Europe with her stepfather. She had a keen interest in European and British politics, in particular following the fortunes of the liberal party. After visiting Budapest in 1876, she researched and wrote a biography of Ferenc Deák which she published anonymously in 1881 in English and Hungarian. O'Brien visited Ireland for the first time in 1878 on holiday. In May 1880 she returned during William Forster's first official visit as chief secretary for Ireland. During the two years of his service in this position, O'Brien spent most of her time in Dublin, whilst there she became part of numerous political and social circles. From her journals, she shows an interest in political developments in Ireland as well as a distrust of the Land League and Irish nationalism.

The English Historical Review, v106 n419 (Apr. 1991): 503–504 JSTOR She moved to Ireland permanently after her marriage to Robert (Robin) Vere O'Brien on 10 July 1883. Her husband, who was from Oldchurch, County Limerick, served as a clerk of the peace at Ennis Courthouse, and as an agent to the Inchiquin and de Vere estates. The couple had two daughters, Jane Elinor and Florence Margaret, and two sons, Aubrey William and Hugh Murrough. The couple lived with Robert's mother and sister at Oldchurch where three of their children were born, before moving to County Clare. Work with the lace industry Upon her move to County Limerick, O'Brien set about supporting the failing Limerick lace industry. She made contact with local lace craftswomen, and provided them with high quality materials as well as her own designs. From this she arranged the sale of the work, using her circle of friends in Dublin and London. O'Brien was a central figure in the foundation of the Private Committee for Promoting Irish Lace, with the support of Alan Cole of the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington and James Brenan RHA. This committee led to the establishment of the lace training school in Limerick in May 1889, and in 1893 on the committee's request her took over the running of the school. When her family moved to New Hall, near Ennis, County Clare, in 1890. In 1895, she established Clare Embroidery, which was run from her home. She was assisted in this endeavour by the O'Briens' children's nurse, a Scotswoman named Mina Keppie, which had the capacity to train up to 15 girls at a time. The business moved with the family to Ballyalla in 1898, and by 1910 they were training up to 27 girls at one time. Both ventures exhibited their work with arts and crafts exhibitions in Ireland, Britain, and America from the 1890s to the 1920s. Amongst these exhibitions were those of the Royal Dublin Society, the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland, the world fairs in Chicago and St Louis in 1893 and 1904 respectively winning several awards. At Lady Arran's Windsor sale in 1900, both Queen Victoria and the princess of Wales purchased examples of their work. Later life As well as her interest in the lace industry, O'Brien was also active in the development of health care in the County Clare area. She served as a member of the Women's National Health Association, and was involved in the foundation of a sanitorium at Ballyalla in 1912. She initiated the Ennis District Nursing Association, running the scheme for a number of years. During and after World War I, she aided ex-servicemen in County Clare through her work with the War Pensions Committee. In the early twentieth century in Ireland there was a decline in the lace industry, which led to the closure of the school in 1922. Clare Embroidery continued production until O'Brien's death on 8 July 1936 at Ballyalla.

He was born in the Thirteen Colonies, possibly in Boston, and came to Newfoundland with his father at the start of the American Revolution. He worked for St. John's merchant Nathaniel Philips as a clerk. Later, Lilly was employed as a notary public and auctioneer. In 1800, he married Mary Ann Roberts. He helped raise a militia unit during the War of 1812 and served himself as a captain. In 1820, he was enrolled as a barrister although he had no formal legal training. In 1834, Lilly was named acting assistant judge for the Supreme Court of Newfoundland. Kielley v. Carson In 1838, he granted a writ of habeas corpus to the solicitor for Edward Kielley, who was being held for an alleged breach of the House of Assembly's parliamentary privilege. Lilly declared the warrant, that had been issued by William Carson, void and set Kielley free. Lilly himself was subsequently arrested by the sergeant-at- arms of the assembly. After two days, he was released following the proroguing of the assembly by Governor Sir Henry Prescott. Following his release, he ruled that the assembly did not necessarily have the same privileges as members of the British House of Commons but that members of the house could pursue justice through the laws of the land like any other citizen. In December 1838, he held a dissenting opinion when the Newfoundland Supreme Court ruled in favour of the assembly in the case Kielley v. Carson. This decision was overturned by the judicial committee of the British Privy Council in January 1843, whose arguments were consistent with those put forward earlier by Lilly. Lilly finished his career mainly as a judge for the northern circuit court. He died in St. John's in 1845.

Woodward also served as a runner for the Collingwood AFL team during the year, and controversially became involved in the play during the 2018 AFL Grand Final to Collingwood's detriment. Late in the third quarter, Collingwood's Taylor Adams miskicked an attempted clearing kick towards centre half back; 's Elliot Yeo and Collingwood's Jaidyn Stephenson would both have had the opportunity to contest the miskick, but Woodward inadvertently blocked Stephenson's path, allowing Yeo to take the mark uncontested and kick a goal. The goal gave West Coast the lead for the first time since early in the game, and West Coast went on to win by five points. In August 2019, following his 5th ACL injury, Woodward announced his retirement from playing football altogether.https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/after-fifth-knee-injury-alex- woodward-retires-with-a-smile-20190829-p52m6k.html Statistics : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2012   36  0  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2013   36  0  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2014   39  2  0  1  6  12  18  1  8  0.0  0.5  3.0  6.0  9.0  0.5  4.0  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"  2015   39  0  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2016   39  0  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 2 ! 0 ! 1 ! 6 ! 12 ! 18 ! 1 ! 8 ! 0.0 ! 0.5 ! 3.0 ! 6.0 ! 9.0 ! 0.5 ! 4.0 ! 0 } Honours and achievements VFL *Individual **J.J.

Klaus Lauer Early life Klaus Joachim Lauer was born in 1950 and studied medicine in Frankfurt (Germany) from 1968 to 1975. He became a resident in the Department of Neurology of Klinikum Darmstadt, the Academic Teaching Hospital of Frankfurt University (Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus der Universitäten Frankfurt/Main und Heidelberg- Mannheim, a major healthcare institution in South Hesse. Besides clinical work, K. Lauer devoted most of his research to epidemiology, with a special focus on MS etiology. Career Early on, he published a series of five articles on multiple sclerosis in the land of Hesse with Prof. Dr. med. Wolfgang Firnhaber, who had already been studying MS epidemiology in Göttingen and Darmstadt, with support from the Hertie Foundation, the German Research Foundation and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft. His lasting collaboration with Prof. Firnhaber, a longtime expert in MS prognostication and geomedical aspects of MS, provided K. Lauer with a solid background in geomedical investigation. In the mid 80's, Dr. Lauer launched a series of specialized reports in Scandinavia, starting with a study of multiple sclerosis in Western Norway published in Neurology. He has been following Norvegian MS ever since and has also coauthored epidemiological studies in Sweden with Anne-Marie Landtblom and Inger Boström. Like John Kurtzke, Klaus J. Lauer has dedicated a large part of his work to the study of MS in the Faroe Islands, starting with a 1986 article in the Journal of Neurology entitled \\"Some comments on the occurrence of multiple sclerosis in the Faroe Islands\\", followed in 1988 by \\"Multiple sclerosis in relation to industrial and commercial activities in the Faroe Islands\\" in the journal Neuroepidemiology, followed one year later by \\"Dietary changes in temporal relation to multiple sclerosis in the Faroe Islands: an evaluation of literary sources\\" in the same journal. Remains of the WW2 British barracks at Vágar Airport on the Faroe Islands British soldiers and children in the Faroe Islands MS is generally considered a multifactorial disease, in which genetic predispositions and environmental triggers combine to launch an autoimmune process. As an international expert on the environmental dimension of MS, Dr. Lauer compiled a review in Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics. Since 1992, Dr Lauer has published a large number of epidemiological studies covering most west European countries, Russia, the USA, Canada, some countries in Asia and the Middle-East, with a special focus on dietary aspects of etiology. Most recently, Klaus Lauer has focused again on MS in the Faroes and has been involved as an expert in the steering committee of the EnviMS study, a major multi-countries study investigating the impact of environmental exposures on MS. Dr Lauer is also one of the authors of a reference study of the cost of MS in Europe and of several publications dealing with technical and methodological considerations in neuroepidemiology applied to multiple sclerosis.

Its circular DNA genome is around 97 kbp in size and contains 80 predicted open reading frames, and the sequence is commonly found in human faecal samples. At its time of discovery, the virus was predicted to infect bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes that are common in the intestinal tract of many animals including humans. Since then, the bacteriophage has been isolated in vitro and confirmed to infect Bacteroides intestinalis. Based on analysis of metagenomics data, crAssphage sequences have been identified in about half of all sampled humans. The virus was named after the crAss (cross-assembly)Cross- Assembly of Metagenomes software that was used to find the viral genome. CrAssphage is possibly the first organism to be named after a computer program for promotional purposes. While crAssphage did not have any known relatives when it was discovered in 2014, a range of related viruses were discovered in 2017. Based on a screen of related sequences in public nucleotide databases and phylogenetic analysis, it was concluded that crAssphage may be part of an expansive bacteriophage family (Podoviridae, order Caudovirales) that is found in a range of environments including human gut and feces, termite gut, terrestrial/groundwater environments, soda lake (hypersaline brine), marine sediment, and plant root environments. There is no indication that crAssphage is involved in human health or disease. The virus may outperform indicator bacteria as a marker for human faecal contamination.

Philip Knight was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, though there is no record that he completed a degree there. After Cambridge, he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers, rising to the rank of major and seeing service in the Indian Mutiny and in the siege and capture of Lucknow. In 1865, he was adjutant of the East Kent Militia. Cricket career At Harrow as a cricketer he was the outstanding batsman in each innings in the 1853 Eton v Harrow cricket match which his side won narrowly. Only three weeks after that, he played his first first-class match: a gentlemanly affair involving the Gentlemen of Kent side against the Gentlemen of England. In 1854, he played in both matches between Cambridge University and the MCC, once for each side, but made little impact, and was not picked for the university again; the rest of his first-class cricket came in amateur games in that 1854 season, except for his final two appearances for MCC and the Gentlemen of Kent 10 years later in 1864.

(HDTGM) is a podcast on the Earwolf network. It is hosted by Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael and Jason Mantzoukas. Each episode, which typically has a different guest, features the deconstruction and mockery of outlandish and bad films. Format The hosts and guest make jokes about the films as well as attempt to unscramble plots. After discussing the film, Scheer reads \\"second opinions\\" in the form of five-star reviews posted online by Amazon.com users. The hosts also often make recommendations on if the film is worth watching. The show is released every two weeks. During the show's off week a \\".5\\" episode (also known as a \\"minisode\\") is uploaded. These episodes feature Scheer's \\"explanation hopeline\\" where he answers questions from fans who call in, the movie for the next week is announced, Scheer reads corrections and omissions from the message board regarding last week's episode, and he opens fan mail and provides his recommendations on books, movies, TV shows etc. that he is enjoying. Some full episodes are recorded in front of a live audience and include a question and answer session and original \\"second opinion\\" theme songs sung by fans. Not all content from the live shows is included in the final released episode - about 30 minutes of each live show is edited out. History How Did This Get Made? began after Scheer and Raphael saw the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Later, the pair talked to Mantzoukas about the movie and joked about the idea for starting a bad movie podcast. , Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps has never been covered on the podcast. Awards In 2019, How Did This Get Made? won a Webby Award in the category of Podcasts – Television & Film. In 2020, How Did This Get Made? won an iHeartRadio award in the category of Best TV & Film Podcast. Spinoffs =How Did This Get Made?: Origin Stories= Between February and September 2017, a 17-episode spin-off series of the podcast was released. Entitled How Did This Get Made?: Origin Stories, author Blake J. Harris would interview people involved with the movies discussed on the podcast. Guests on the show included director Mel Brooks, who served as executive producer on Solarbabies, and screenwriter Dan Gordon, who wrote Surf Ninjas. =Unspooled= In May 2018, Scheer began a new podcast with Amy Nicholson titled Unspooled that is also devoted to movies. Unlike HDTGM?, however, Unspooled looks at films deemed good enough for the updated 2007 edition of the AFI Top 100. This is often referenced in How Did This Get Made? by Mantzoukas and Raphael, who are comically annoyed at how they were not invited to host the podcast, instead being subjected to the bad films that HDTGM covers. =How Did This Get Played?= In June 2019, the Earwolf network launched the podcast How Did This Get Played?, hosted by Doughboys host Nick Wiger and former Saturday Night Live writer Heather Anne Campbell.

He was in British India from 1863 to 1889. Life Born at Aberdeen in July 1840, he was only son of William Irvine, an Aberdeen advocate, by his wife Margaret Garden. On the death of his father when he was a child, his mother, of an Aberdeen family but a Londoner by birth, brought him to London. He owed most of his education to his mother and grandmother. Leaving a private school before he was 15, he served a short apprenticeship to business, and after spending some years as a clerk in the admiralty passed for the Indian Civil Service. He landed in Calcutta late in 1863, and was posted to the North- Western Provinces. He served there as a magistrate and collector until he retired and left India in 1889. He was employed for eight years in revising the rent and revenue settlement records of the Ghazipur district. In 1908 the Asiatic Society of Bengal made Irvine an honorary member. He was a vice- president and member of the council of the Royal Asiatic Society; he served also on the council of the Central Asian and other learned societies. He died at his house in Castelnau, Barnes, after a long illness on 3 November 1911, and was buried in the Old Barnes cemetery. Works Irvine's major work of scholarship was a translation and edition (Storia do Mogor 1907, Government of India) of the chronicle of the Venetian traveller Niccolao Manucci. After François Bernier, Manucci was the main contemporary European authority for the history of India during the reign of Aurangzeb (1658–1707). Manucci's work was known at the end of the 19th century only in a garbled French version. Over eight years Irvine discovered a Berlin codex which gives a part of the text, and a Venice manuscript which supplies the whole. Manucci had dictated his work in Latin, French, Italian, or Portuguese. In India Irvine was known as an authority on the provincial laws of rent and revenue. In 1868, while still an assistant, he published his Rent Digest, a digest of the rent law of the province. In 1879 he produced a history of the Afghan Nawabs of Fatehgarh or Farrukhabad (Journ. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, 1879). On returnng to Britain he began a history of the decline of the Mogul empire, planned as from the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 to the capture of Delhi by Lord Lake in 1803. Chapters appeared in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal between 1896 and 1908, though history itself was not carried later than the accession of Mahomed Shah in 1719. Related papers appeared in the Journals of the Royal Asiatic Society of London and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Asiatic Quarterly Review, and the Indian Antiquary; and in 1903 Irvine published a long work The Army of the Indian Moghuls: its organisation and administration. Irvine also contributed in 1908 the chapter on Mogul history to the new Gazetteer of India. His last significant publication was a life of Aurangzeb in the Indian Antiquary for 1911; a résumé appeared the same year in the Encyclopédie d'Islam. Family In 1872 Irvine married Teresa Anne, youngest daughter of Major Evans, and grandniece of Sir George de Lacy Evans. She died in 1901, and was buried in the same grave with her husband. There was one son, Henry, an electrical engineer in the West Indies and a daughter.

It was founded by a large group of cable television operators as Cable Thai Holding, a holding company established for dealing and share its content. It was offering pay television channels on an analog CATV system which had a largest customer base in Thailand with over 2.5 million households before started its own pay TV business as CTH. CTH holds English Premier League broadcast rights for season 2013/14 till 2015/16 in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. History = Early history = Cable Thai Holding Public Company Limited was set up in August 2009 by over 100 Thailand cable television operators with initial capital of 50 million baht. Its mission was to provide TV program licenses, unified channel line up, marketing for member cable operators to expand their subscriber base.Company Information Archived web page of company website (in Thai) In February 2010, the company, headed by president Kesem Inkaew who was also president of Thailand Cable TV Association, started its CTH platform with 26 leading cable channels broadcast via ABS1 satellite for its member cable operators to redistribute to their subscribers. = Expansion = Major change to the company organization happened in April 2012, when Wichai Thongtang, a businessman and former Thaksin Shinawatra lawyer, acquired 25% of CTH while Thai Rath newspaper family, headed by Vachara Vacharapol, acquired another 25% of the company. CTH also looked for another partner for 20% stake while the remaining 30% was still held by cable operators. The company capital was also raised to 1 billion baht. Wichai Thongtang became the company chairman. In August 2012, TrueVisions announced partnership with CTH to allow CTH access to nine channels produced by TrueVisions. In November 2012, CTH won the broadcast right to English Premier League from 2013–14 to 2015–16 seasons with the highest price in Asia and the second highest in the world valued $320 million. The service started broadcast via cable-TV providers and on satellite via Vinasat-2 in mid-August 2013, just weeks before English Premier League started its new season. In September 2013, CTH filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. and its local company, Apple South Asia (Thailand), accusing of violating intellectual property rights for commercial purposes and counterfeiting or altering a registered trademark for ฿100 million after they allow an app call \\"Sports Channel\\" that allow the user to watch EPL live broadcasts to be sold on Apple's App Store. In January 2014, CTH collaborated with PSI Holdings to offered English Premier League packages in lower price aiming to expand the subscribers. CTH also acquired the broadcast rights to WWE programmes in a five-year deal to broadcast on CTH Sport Spirit channel and later on dedicated CTH WWE channel.

In the same month, they lost Premier League bid for the next three seasons to beIN Sports with a lower price than theirs from the last three years. In late January 2016, CTH cancelled their Z Pay-TV packages provided for GMM Z customer following by the cancellation of its channels on PSI and RS Sunbox packages in February 2016. On 1 August 2016, CTH ceased its KU-band broadcast via Thaicom satellite after they laid off its around 100 employees and announced to cease all of their broadcasting service on 1 September 2016 after its rival TrueVisions acquired sub-licensing rights to broadcast Premier League from beIN Sport until 2019.

It is part of UNESCO's Rhön Biosphere Reserve and has an area of 66.4 hectares. It is thus the largest bog complex in the Rhön. Much of the moor is a largely undisturbed and intact raised bog. It is part of the Europe-wide conservation system, Natura 2000, and one of the most important raised bogs in Central Europe. The Black Moor lies on the watershed between the Rhine and Weser rivers. In 2007 the Black Moor was included in the List of the 100 most beautiful geotopes in Bavaria. The Black Moor is an eccentric, cupola-shaped, raised bog. Its surface appearance resembles that of the northern kermi bogs. From its central plateau which lies near the higher edge of the bog in the north, where the peat is up to 8 metres thick in places, the surface of the terrain falls away on all sides. The central plateau forms an almost rectangular area with a length of about 800 metres from northwest to southeast and a width of about 400 metres. On the steepest slopes there are hollows running parallel to the contours: elongated, sharply defined troughs known as flarks (Schlenken). These are up to 50 metres long and between one and three metres deep.  Location  Central part of the moor The Black Moor lies in the Lower Franconian parish of Hausen, six kilometres from Fladungen on the High Rhön Road and on the state road, ST 2287, from Seiferts, one kilometre southeast of the border with Thuringia and two kilometres east of the border with Hesse. It lies at an elevation of 770 to 782 metres above sea level (NN) in a shallow hollow that slopes gently southeast on the upper slopes of the 805-metre-high Querenberg, whose summit is about one kilometre to the west. The bog is drained mainly by the Eisgraben, twelve metres lower, to the south. This stream empties into the Streu, six kilometres east and 400 metres lower down, its waters forming part of the drainage basin of the River Rhine. Another stream drains the bog into the Hessian Ulster, which is three kilometres to the west and just under 300 metres lower and belongs to the Weser basin.  Name  The moor pathway The Black Moor, along with the Red Moor, is one of the larger moors in the High Rhön, whose name, according to tradition, comes from the colour of the original vegetation. The vicar cooperator of Simmershausen, Franz Anton Jäger, a keen naturalist, wrote in his letters about the High Rhoene of Franconia, published in 1803, that the Black Moor was much wetter than the Red Moor. As a result, the red Magellan's Peatmoss (Sphagnum magellanicum), the plant that gave the Red Moor its name and which also grew in the Black Moor, became waterlogged as soon as it germinated, became mouldy and black, thus giving rise to the name of the Black Moor.Willy Kiefer: Die Moore der Rhön. page 10.

Harakat Sham al-Islam first came to notice because of the role it played in the 2013 Latakia offensive. The following year the group was one of the three primary factions, alongside Al-Nusra Front and Ansar al-Sham, that took part in the 2014 Latakia offensive. Harakat Sham al- Islam also has a presence in Aleppo, being involved in battles for Kindi Hospital and the Aleppo Central Prison.

In an interview in 2015 a representative from the group was asked about their views regarding both al-Nusra and ISIL to which the representative said regarding al-Nusra \\"The problem is with them, not with us: we are prepared to work with all upright factions whose goals are like ours. It is not hidden from anyone that the goals of the majority of factions are like our goals.\\" He added when asked if al-Nusra has made mistakes on the ground \\"In my personal opinion indeed we all make mistakes…and perhaps in Jabhat al-Nusra’s point of view it is not necessary to establish a Caliphate while the gangs of Assad exist in Syria.\\" When asked about the group's stance on ISIL he said \\"We have no relation with IS (Islamic State). We don’t fight them and they don’t fight us.

These cells regulate the immune system by different mechanisms. The main mechanism is a production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). The regulatory effects of Bregs were described in various models of inflammation, autoimmune diseases, transplantation reactions and in anti-tumor immunity. History In the 1970s it was noticed that Bregs could suppress immune reaction independently of antibody production. In 1996 Janeway´s group observed an immunomodulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by B cells. Similar results were shown in a model of chronic colitis one year later. Then a role of Bregs was found in many mouse models of autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Development and populations Bregs can develop from different subsets of B cells. Whether Breg cells uniquely derive from a specific progenitor or originate within conventional B cell subsets is still an open question. Bregs shared many markers with various B cells subsets due to their origin. Mouse Bregs were mainly CD5 and CD1d positive in model of EAE or after exposition of Leishmania major. By contrast mouse Bregs in model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were mainly CD21 and CD23 positive. Breg were found in human, too. Markers of peripheral blood Bregs were molecules CD24 and CD38. However, peripheral blood Bregs were mostly CD24 and CD27 positive after cultivation with anti-CD40 antibody and CpG bacterial DNA. They were also positive for CD25, CD71 and PD-L1 after stimulation by CpG bacterial DNA and through TLR9. Mechanisms of action Strukture of interleukin 10 (IL-10). Key player in Breg biology. There are several mechanisms of Breg action. Nevertheless, the most examined mechanism is production of IL-10. IL-10 has strong anti- inflammatory effects. and it inhibits or suppresses inflammatory reactions mediated by T cells, especially Th1 type immune reactions. This was shown for example in model EAE, CIA or contact hypersensitivity. Likewise, regulatory B cell subsets have also been demonstrated to inhibit Th1 responses through IL-10 production during chronic infectious diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis. Next suppressive Breg mechanism is production of transforming growth factor (TGF-β), another anti-inflammatory cytokine. Role of Bregs producing TGF-β was found in mouse of models of SLE and diabetes. Another mechanism of Breg acting involves surface molecules, for example FasL or PD-L1, which cause death of target cells.  Activation  Resting B lymphocytes do not produce cytokines. After lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation are produced TNFα, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-6. This indicates that Breg must be stimulated to produce suppressive cytokines. There are two types of signals to activate Breg, namely signals generated by external pathogens and endogenous signals produced by the action of body cells. Structures characteristic of pathogenic microorganisms recognize the TLR receptors that trigger a signal cascade at the end of which is the production of effector cytokines. The main endogenous signal is the stimulation of the surface molecule CD40.  Models of action  = Autoimmune diseases = In autoimmune diseases, many models of Breg involvement are described in the suppression or alleviation of autoimmune pathology. The most well-known mechanism of action of Bregs is the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, most IL-10. This mechanism was described in the EAE model, but also in lupus erythematosus. Another cytokine produced with an anti-inflammatory effect is TGF-β, which has a role in the suppression of T lymphocytes, for example in diabetes. Not just cytokines can cause an anti-inflammatory state. There is also the second option to do it. There are also surface molecules (which may be FasL), which after binding to the target cell receptor, causes apoptosis. An increase in expression of this molecule has been described in the collagen- induced arthritis model. = Tumors = In order to suppress immune responses, it is possible that cancerous proliferation uses Breg for its leakage from the immune system. Leukemia B cells spontaneously produce large amounts of IL-10. Similarly, secretion of TNF-α B cells promotes the development of skin carcinoma. However, the positive effect of Breg on the treatment of cancer is also described. In patients with metastatic cancer, those with a higher number of CD20 positive B lymphocytes in the lymph nodes are more likely to survive. = Transplantation = The immunosuppressive properties of Breg play an essential role in allotransplants. It is necessary to cushion the immune response against the transplant and Breg can do it. For other types of transplants, B cells can participate both in tolerance and more often in transplant rejection, depending on the origin of Breg subpopulations.

Life George Witt was born at Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire, the fifth son of Matthew Witt, a farmer, and Sarah (née Woollard). He was baptised on 23 May 1805, at St. Mary's Church, Swaffham Prior. Witt studied to become a physician at Northampton General Infirmary before he worked briefly for the East India Company. He notably took charge of a cholera epidemic on board a ship at Calcutta. He became a surgeon at Bedford Infirmary from where he visited Leiden for just three months. Based on his work in Calcutta he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the University.David Gaimster, 'Witt, George (1804–1869)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2010 accessed 27 July 2014 Witt married Elizabeth Hedley in Bedford in 1832. He practised as a doctor in Bedford where he rose to be the medical lead at Bedford Infirmary and by 1834 he was elected to the Mayor of Bedford. Witt was also elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society the same year. Witt however failed to become an Alderman in Bedford until 1845 as his first application was turned down as he was not thought to have been a first class mayor a decade before. In 1849 he was made \\"physician extraordinary\\" after he resigned from the Infirmary citing personal reasons. Witt had been recognised for the contribution of anatomical specimens and his collection of antiquities and natural history artefacts were particularly valued and it was thought that the town could establish a museum based on Witt's collection. Part of this collection was sold and eventually became part of first Bedford Modern School and eventually Bedford Museum. The Witt family tomb at Swaffham Prior Australia and London Witt emigrated to Australia and settled in Sydney in 1850 where he resumed his medical career. Within a short time however he was distracted to banking and speculation and at this occupation he made a fortune as a banker. Witt returned to the United Kingdom where he used his money to establish a new house near Hyde Park. Witt now began to put together a collection of what would have been considered obscene objects. Witt was not concerned with the detailed provenance of these objects and he collected both ancient and modern items. Witt shared these objects with an international group of correspondents who appreciated these artefacts. Some of the items concerned nothing more unusual than body cleaning including the Uerdingen Hoard.Toilet set, British Museum, retrieved 31 July 2014 Frontispiece of Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients by Richard Payne Knight as republished by Witt in 1865 In the 1860s there was a lot of interest in the theories concerning the worship of Priapus and Witt organised for Richard Payne Knight's Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients to be republished with additional material and illustrations in 1865. Following an illness the same year, Witt approached the British Museum to enquire whether they would take his collection. The museum's director Anthony Panizzi agreed to take the objects even though they became a major part of a secret collection known as the museum's Secretum. Panizzi did not think twice as he considered the collection to be of the right quality for his museum. The collection appeared to be chosen primarily on the basis of its obscenity. The collection included modern photographs of women partially dressed as gladiators which were not thought to be academic artefacts but they were designed to be erotic. One of the artefacts was a toothed chastity belt which was thought to be medieval but was in fact a contemporary invention. In general however Witt's collection covered the major civilisations of Greece, Rome, Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese and Native American. Besides votive objects, bronzes and pottery his collection also included watercolours and sketches. Of particular note were his library and the records of his correspondence which included the details of objects not in the collection including a catalogue of the secret cabinet of Naples Museum. Following the acceptance of his collection by the British Museum in 1865, Witt published \\"Catalogue of a Collection Illustrative of Phallic Worship\\" in 1866 to commemorate the approval of his artefacts by Panizzi. Witt died on 20 February 1869, at his home, 20 Princes' Terrace, Hyde Park, London. He was buried at Swaffham Prior. His wife, Elizabeth (née Hedley), died at the same house in 1871 and was also buried at Swaffham Prior. Legacy Witt's collection remained together in the Secretum until the Second World War. In 1939 the first set of artefacts were removed from the collection, which was based on taste, and they were classified according to its provenance. An interesting anecdote arose when an enquiry was received at the museum to view the remaining items. The request was challenged by the curators. They wanted to know why the researcher was making an application to view the collection's index. The museum also not only wanted to know what the list would be used for but what arrangements would be made to dispose of the list after the researchers death. In 2014 the \\"secret\\" collection contains half of Witt's legacy which have not been reclassified. The curators of the museum thinks that these remaining items, and another 100 items from other sources, will be kept as a single collection as these items record Victorian values and the changing attitude to obscenity.

The tone sounds discontinuous to some listeners. Example of illusory discontinuity stimulus: continuous tone with spectrally remote noise. The tone sounds discontinuous to some listeners. Illusory discontinuity is an auditory illusion in which a continuous ongoing sound becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise. The illusion is perceived only by some listeners, but not by others, reflecting individual variation in hearing abilities. It has been estimated that among young adults 24% are susceptible to illusory discontinuity.Vinnik E, Itskov PM, Balaban E (2011). \\"Individual differences in sound-in-noise perception are related to the strength of short-latency neural responses to noise.\\" PLoS One. 6(2): e17266. . The most susceptible listeners describe their sensations in terms of the sound actually containing a physical gap. The illusory discontinuity is strongest when the interrupting sound is short (50ms). Longer sounds elicit weaker illusory discontinuity; this effect may be related to better auditory segregation.  Relation to other auditory illusions  Illusory discontinuity is antagonistic with illusory continuity of tones (auditory filling-in). While illusory continuity restores perceptual continuity of obscured sounds, illusory discontinuity disrupts the perception even if the sound is indeed continuous. Listeners strongly susceptible to illusory discontinuity do not perceive illusory auditory continuity .  Relation to auditory masking  The illusion is likely to be a novel form of informational masking (broadly defined as a degradation of auditory detection or discrimination of a signal embedded in a context of other similar sounds).Leek MR, Brown ME, Dorman MF (1991) Informational masking and auditory attention. Percept Psychophys. 50(3):205-14 Illusory discontinuity cannot be explained by simultaneous masking, because it appears even if the noise is as far as one octave away.  Relation to auditory stream segregation  It has been suggested that illusory discontinuity is related to inability to segregate the ongoing sound from the interrupting noise, although more research is needed to prove this.  Physiology  The mechanism of the illusory discontinuity is unknown. An electroencephalographic study has demonstrated that participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early neural responses at 40–66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses. This suggests that the individual variability in perceiving discontinuity illusion is related to neural processing of the interrupting sound.

It is located in the Drivdalen valley, just south of the village of Holan, about south of the village of Oppdal. It is a smaller mountain chapel in the Oppdal parish which is part of the Gauldal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The small wooden chapel was built in 2012 by the architect Yngvild Wathne Sæther. The church seats about 50 people, but it is sometimes used as the backdrop for outdoor services The building was planned by the Tourism Drivdalen working group, the result of some planning for the future that was organized in the winter of 2010. The idea of a church with a connection to The Pilegrims Path over the Dovrefjell Mountains, comes from the fact that during the middle ages there was a church called Loskirka (The Church of Loe) in the Drivdalen valley, located at one of the farms in Losgrenda. The parish priest, Arne Aspeland, contributed to the work in designing the chapel interior. The church has no graveyard. The chapel was built on a voluntary basis with financial support from a number of local companies including Holtermann’s Endowment managed by the Oppdal church council (the endowment ended in 2012). The building was consecrated on Michaelmas, 29 September 2012, with the parish priest Arne Aspeland, Bishop Tor Singsaas, Dean Øystein Flø, and Pastor Øyvind Vognild present at the ceremony. Aspeland had the honor of leading the first Mass that was held in conjunction with the consecration.

Background Duft was born in Frankfurt and Bassenauer in Darmstadt, Germany, both in 1938.Historia, 2007 They were both plumbers. Duft was single, while Bassenauer was married, with three children. Duft had briefly served in the Foreign Legion during the war in Algeria.Historia, 2007 Crimes Duft and Bassenauer arrived in Greece by car on 17 February 1969.Palmographos, 2013 Within the next few weeks, posing as tourists, they murdered six people, using a gun or a knife. The reason for most of their murders was robbery. On the 5 March, they killed the night watchman of a gas station near Thebes and a soldier who was present. On 13 March, they murdered a Greek-American stockbroker in Voula, on 7 April a taxi driver and on 9 April a gas station attendant near Athens. Finally, on 12 April, they murdered, on the road from Athens to Patras a Greek who was living in Germany and vacationing in his homeland. They abandoned their car and took the victim's to return to Athens. The dictatorial regime in Greece at the time forbade newspapers from publishing news about this series of murders, until the two perpetrators were captured. Capture The police were alerted, on the 16 April, by a Greek woman who saw \\"small specks of blood\\" on a car with German license plates parked outside her house, which was, in fact, the car of the pair's last victim. Duft and Bassenauer were apprehended when they showed up to pick up the car, questioned and then arrested by the police. They confessed to their crimes and put to trial, accused of murder, robbery, and related charges. Trial and punishment The trial of Duft and Bassenauer was held shortly thereafter at the Appeals Court. They were found guilty and sentenced to death for each one of the murders.

Finland under Swedish rule refers to the historical period when the bulk of the area that later came to constitute Finland was an integral part of Sweden. The starting point of Swedish rule is under a large amount of uncertainty and controversy. Historical evidence of the establishing of Swedish rule in Finland exists from the late 13th century onwards. The period of Swedish rule ended in the so called Old Finland in 1721 as a result of the Great Northern War and in the rest of the country on 17 September 1809, as a result of the Finnish War. Swedish rule in the area of modern-day Finland started as a result of the Northern Crusades. Due to the Swedish conquest, Finnish upper class lost its position and lands to new Swedish and German nobility and to the Catholic Church. The Swedish colonisation of some coastal areas of Finland with Christian population followed the crusades. This was a way to retain power in former pagan areas that had been conquered. It has been estimated that there were thousands of colonists. Colonisation led to several conflicts between the colonists and local population which have been recorded in the 14th century. In colonised areas the Finnish population principally lost its fishing and cultivation rights to the colonists. Though the Finnish provinces were an integral part of the Kingdom of Sweden with the same legal rights and duties as the rest of the realm, Finnish-speaking Swedish subjects faced comparative challenges in dealing with the authorities as Swedish was established as the sole official language of government. In fact, it remained a widely accepted view in Sweden proper that the Finns were in principle a separate and conquered people and therefore not necessarily entitled to be treated equitably with Swedes. Swedish kings visited Finland rarely and in Swedish contemporary texts Finns were often portrayed as primitive and their language inferior. Approximately half of the taxes collected in Finland was used in the country, while the other half was transferred to Stockholm. As a part of Sweden, Finland was annexed as part of the Western Christian domain and the cultural, communal and economic order of Western Europe, on which the market economy, constitutional governments and legalistic principles were founded. Finland was the eastern frontier of the realm, which brought many wars and raids to the areas. The Finnish language, dating from prehistoric times, and some parts of folklore religion and culture remained under Swedish rule, even though they changed as they adapted to new circumstances. For example, in this period Finnish adopted the Latin alphabet as its writing system and approximately 1100 Swedish loanwords, though most of them are originally from Latin or Greek. Swedish-ruled Finland has in the 20th century also been referred to as \\"Sweden–Finland\\". The term has been used to refer to the realm consisting of the main parts of current Sweden and Finland. The historian Peter Englund has noted that Swedish-ruled Finland was not so much part of a national union or a province as \\"the eastern half of the realm which was practically destroyed in 1809, when both parts went on along their separate ways.\\" Englund thinks that the period of Sweden as a superpower was the common \\"property\\" of Sweden and Finland, because the rise as a superpower would have been impossible for a poor nation without the resources of the eastern part of the realm.Englund, Peter: Suuren sodan vuodet, Finnish language version, introduction. See also: finnica.fi. Medieval times (c. 1150 – 1523) =Finland becomes part of Sweden= The bishop Henry and Lalli The starting point of the Swedish rule is under a large amount of uncertainty. It is connected to the efforts of the Catholic Church to expand the faith in the Eastern Baltic Sea region and to Northern Crusades. Prevalent view of the two- branched border set in the treaty of Nöteborg. Show in red the undisputed section of the border, shown in black dotted line the two branches of the border and in gray the border that was in use in 16th century. According to the legend of Eric the Holy, written in the 1270s, the King of Sweden Eric the Holy and English bishop Henry made the First Crusaded to southwest Finland in the 1150s. According to the chronicle and other fabulous sources, the bishop Henry was converting people to Christianity in the areas of Finland Proper and Satakunta during the crusade. The crusade is not considered to be a real event. Also, the Christianisation of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in the 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian. According to Eric Chronicles Swedish kingdom, which was only starting to form, made two crusades to Finland in the 13th century. The so-called Second Crusade against Tavastians in 1249-1250 and the so-called Third Crusade against Karelians in 1293. According to historical sources, the reason for the crusades besides spreading catholic faith, were the numerous raids that heathen Finnish tribes made to Sweden. Pope Alexander IV even accepted marriage between Swedish king Valdemar and Sophia, daughter of Danish king Eric IV, so they could better repel heathen attacks. By the 14th century, with the successful crusades and the partly colonisation of Finnish coastline with Christian Swedish colonists, what is now Western and Southern Finland and the Karelian isthmus, had become part of Sweden, Catholic Church and the Uppsala diocese. Eastern Karelia, the Käkisalmi region and the Ladoga Karelia retained their ties to the Orthodox Church and to Novgorod. The Treaty of Nöteborg, made in 1323 between Sweden and Novgorod, was the first treaty that defined the eastern boundary of the Swedish realm and Finland at least for Karelia. The boundary in northern Finland remained unclear. However, Sweden annexed the Finnish population on the shores of Northern Ostrobothnia in the 14th century to its realm. Finland as part of the Kingdom of Sweden Magnus Ericson on his national law book The older part of the Turku Castle viewed from the harbour To help establish the power of the King of Sweden, three castles were built: the Turku Castle in Finland Proper, the Häme Castle in Tavastia and the Vyborg Castle in Karelia. In mediaeval times the castles were important for the defence of Finland and they also acted as government centers in Finland. The government area surrounding a castle was called a slottslän (linnalääni in Finnish). Sweden was an electoral kingdom in mediaeval times and the election was held at the stones of Mora. Finland also received the right to send their representative to the election in 1362, which shows the established role of Finland as part of Sweden. The development of government and justice had a large role in the law established during the reign of king Magnus IV of Sweden. In mediaeval times, the historical regions of Finland Proper and Satakunta were part of the central area of the Swedish government and retained the ties to Scandinavia they had formed already during prehistory. In Southwest Finland, Tavastia, southern Karelia there was permanent agricultural population, which gradually condensed and spread to a larger area. The spreading and establishment of the new population in Middle and North Ostrobothnia was one of the most notable events in the history of the Finnish population during the mediaeval ages. In Åland, the Turku archipelago and the coastal regions of Ostrobothnia and Nylandia there also was a Swedish-speaking population. In the mediaeval ages, peasants were by far the largest population group in Finland. A large part of the area of current Finland was a wilderness in mediaeval times, where people from Satakunta, Tavastia and Karelia held hunting trips, and which was inhabited by Lapps, at least some of which spoke Sami. The wilderness was not part of any government area in practical terms. In the early times of the Swedish rule, official government documents were often written in Latin, which emphasised the role of the clergy also in secular government. The use of old Swedish as a written government language increased during the 14th century. In local governments in cities, particularly concerning international trade, the Middle Low German language was also largely used. It is however impossible to present accurate approximations of the relations of different languages in mediaeval times. The countryside and cities Unlike the situation in central Europe, peasants in Sweden were free and feudalism never developed in the Swedish realm in the proportion it did in central Europe. The local government was based on local settlements (socken) and parishes in the countryside. In the medieval times, the concept of cities was introduced to Finland. The bourgeoisie living in the cities, such as merchants and handicraft workers, only represented a small part of the population. The most important mediaeval cities in Finland were Turku and Viipuri. Other cities were Naantali, Rauma, Ulvila and Porvoo. Faraway trade in Finland and other Nordic countries in the mediaeval times was mostly in the hands of German Hanseatic League merchants and as such a significant portion of the bourgeoisie in Turku and Viipuri were Germans. In cities, the local government was in the hands of a court led by a mayor. The frälse The Ordinance of Alsnö, given during the reign of Magnus III of Sweden, established a small secular frälse (Finnish: rälssi) or nobility, freed from tax, in Sweden and Finland in 1280. The spiritual frälse meant spiritual people who were exempt from paying tax to the secular government (such as priests, nuns and beggar brothers). The parishes of the Catholic church in the area of Finland belonged to the Archdiocese of Turku. The bishop of Turku, the head of the diocese, had as well as power over the church, a large amount of secular power, and he was a member of the Privy Council of Sweden. One of the most notable mediaeval bishops of Turku was Magnus II Tavast, who held the office from 1412 to 1450. The spiritual frälse were the educated, literate intellectuals in mediaeval Finland. Its members had often attended the Turku cathedral school and some had also studied in foreign universities. =The age of the Kalmar Union= Finland as part of the Kalmar Union Queen Margaret I The Nordic Kalmar Union was founded by Queen of Denmark Margaret I in 1397. In practice, conflicts arose within the union, as the Swedish high classes with their expansion policy were interested in the east, the direction of Russia, whereas the Danish were more interested in the souththe direction of the German lands. There were also internal conflicts between the high class of individual nations. The struggle to power was not only the result of \\"foreign political\\" differences in modern parlance. Even in the union age, Finland did not form a continuous governmental area but was divided into two separate governmental districts. Viipuri acted as a significant, sometimes almost independent centre, whereas Turku was a more integral part of the governmental area of the central authority. According to Kauko Pirinen, \\"In the decentralised union nation Finland was also decentralised. In practical terms, it was not a continuous political entity.\\" The independent position of Viipuri was evident in that although Finland was divided into two separate lawspeaker areas, Southern and Northern Finland, in 1435, Viipuri had its own independent Karelian lawspeaker area already in the 1440s, with the lawspeaker probably appointed by the chief of the Viipuri Castle. However, the Karelian lawspeaker had no authority in the Turku land court.Holappa, Veli: Verot ja oikeuslaitos 1500-1600 -luvulla: Keskiaikainen oikeudenkäyttö In the union age, Finland's position as part of the realm changed. For four decades, the monarch's grasp of Finland was tighter than before. King Eric of Pomerania visited Finland twice, in 1403 and in 1407. With the union, the leading authorities in Finland also changed, as the king placed his own trustees to lead the castles. Abraham Broderson rose as the chief of the Turku Castle and the Danish Klaus Fleming was appointed as lawspeaker. Later, Klaus Lydekesson Djäkn and Krister Nilsson Vasa rose to significant positions. The bishop Magnus II Tavast was a supporter of the union power. The community under the union times The frälse and the clergy formed the leading political group under the union times. Finland's own frälse only rarely ruled over larger slottslän, which were mostly ruled by Swedes or Danes, sometimes even German-born men, who had however lived in Finland for decades. The Finnish frälse was mostly responsible for the lower government, military duty and especially justice. The most significant duties in the church were also assigned to sons of the Finnish frälse under the union times. However, peasants could also participate in the activities of different courts and have an effect in political decisions, such as the election of the king. Apart from Turku and Viborg, cities under union times were small, and numbered very few. As such, foreign trade was modest. Even Viborg could not compete with Reval (Tallinn) as the centre of Russian trade. Domestic trade was economically more significant than foreign trade. Under the union times, the Finnish government was reorganised to help the economic situation. In 1405, hundreds of farms had their tax exemption status revoked. With this, the foundation for systematic agricultural taxing was created. The crown attempted to raise tax income also by settler activities: farming fields caused tax income, whereas work in the wilderness did not. Tax income could be raised by dealing out wilderness areas for permanent population. In 1409, Turku started minting its own money, which had a different value than the money used in the rest of Sweden. They were örtugs made of silver and six penny coins. In 1407, Finland got its own supreme court, the Turku land court, which was also given governmental powers. The leaders of Finland could now decide on their country's matters in their own meetings. The union begins to fall apart Externally, the early times of the Kalmar Union were a time of peace for Finland. With his active foreign policy, the king Eric of Pomerania ran into conflict with the Hanseatic League, which made trade more difficult. In the 1430s, the upper class and peasant rebel movements in Sweden did not really have an effect on Finland. The opposition to the upper class caused by the minor peasant rebel movements in Finland can be explained by the expansion of the property of the crown and the frälse.Katajala, Kimmo: Suomalainen kapina, p. 136. The best known of these rebel movements was the so-called \\"David rebellion\\" in Tavastia in 1439. It was directed at the Viikki manor.Ylikangas, Heikki: Nuijasota, p. 174.Katajala, pp. 124–137. No one from Finland participated in the Arboga meeting in 1435. In the same autumn, the bishop Magnus II Tavast and Krister Nilsson arrived in Sweden, and in the negotiations there they participated in the discharge of the leaders of the Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson rebellion and the forming of a compromise. Krister Nilsson became the drots (seneschal) and Karl Knutsson Bonde became the marshal. After Nilsson had returned to Finland in the same autumn, rebel movements started in Sweden again. In order to fight the rebel movements, the Finnish peasants were promised a cut in taxes in a letter dated 24 June 1436, signed by the archbishop, the drots and the marshal, under authority from the government. The stated reason was that the Finns had proven to be loyal to the realm and sworn never to take up a leader of their own, and promised not to rise up in rebellion, and accepted the leader appointed by the government. Seppo Suvanto has interpreted this so that Sweden feared that the Finnish local government would detach itself from the Swedish realm and the Finns would choose a leader of their own.Salminen, Tapio: Suomen linnojen ja voutikuntien hallinto 1412-1448, pp. 37–38. Master's thesis, University of Tampere 1993. Clashes of power between Finland and Sweden Christian I Charles VIII (Carl II) sculpted by Bernt Notke The king was finally deposed in 1439, after which Sweden was ruled by a council of aristocrats. It was composed of bishops and leading noblemen. The mightiest of this group was Karl Knutsson, who was elected leader of the realm in 1438. His biggest competitor, the drots Krister retreated to Vyborg after this. After the fall of the absolutist government, Finland's connections to Denmark were severed. However, the connections to Sweden were not really strengthened but local slottslän governors mostly ruled the country. In 1440, the Danish invited Christopher of Bavaria to their country and elected him as their king. In Sweden, negotiations were being held about the conditions of his recognition. Charles VIII of Sweden moved to Finland in the same year and took hold of the Turku and Kastelholm castles, promising to denounce his position as leader of the realm if he were to receive the whole of Finland as his county. This wish was granted, apart from Åland. However, the situation changed very quickly, and Charles VIII had to contend himself with the Vyborg slottslän. Turku returned to the power of an official appointed by the king. The king's intention was to prevent the forming of a continuous Finland. After Christopher died in 1448, Charles VIII sailed from Vyborg to Stockholm with 800 armed men, where he was elected king (1448 to 1457), apparently because of his military superiority. His term was marked by a war with Christian I of Denmark, which caused taxes to rise also in Finland. During this period, Finland was the king's most significant support area. In 1457, the Swedish high nobility rebelled against the king, and he fled to Danzig. Christian I was elected as king of Sweden. He ruled from 1457 to 1464. However, not all people supported the new kingespecially in Vyborg. Dispute over the eastern border The next period was marked by problems in the eastern parts of the realm. As population spread to the wilderness, border disputes and fights with Novgorod and the Karelians started. As Savonian population spread, Northern Karelia was also populated. In 1478, Novgorod was annexed to Moscow, and a new power arose beyond the eastern border. To secure the border, the Olavinlinna castle was built to protect the new settlers. The Russians viewed this as a breach of the border treaty, and open war reigned for many ears until the interim peace in 1482. However, the parties could not agree on where the border was to be located. From Axelsson to Sten Sture Sten Sture sculpted by Bernt Notke In the battle for the Swedish crown, Finnish castles were also conquered and persuaded to the union king's side. The Danish knight Erik Axelsson Tott came with his brothers to conquer castles in the 1480s, and in the end, all the castles were under the power of the Axelssons. After Erik's death he left the Vyborg, Hämeenlinna and Savonlinna counties to his brothers Ivar and Lauri, who already ruled over Raseborg. However, the formation of a continuous circle of power did not fit to the regent Sten Sture's plans. In 1481 Sten Sture arrived in Finland, all the way to Vyborg. The regent and the local governors could not come to an agreement: the regent promised tax cuts to the people; the local landowners could not accept this. In the end of the union times, no regent had universal acceptance from all the Nordic countries any more. The King of Denmark John (reigned 1481–1513) was not accepted in the union countries, and the councils took power into their own hands. In 1483 Sten Sture received power over three counties in Finland: Vyborg, Savonlinna and Hämeenlinna. The former realm of the Axelssons became the regent's support area and Finland became an even more integral part of the central government; especially as even Raseborg came to the power of Sten Sture's supporter Knut Posse. Sture did not distribute the castles to the nobility, but ruled over them through officials dependent on him, gathering a significant amount of tax income to himself. Unrest during the end of mediaeval times In the late 15th century, previous skirmishes with Moscow escalated into a war. In 1495, the Vyborg Castle was sieged. People from Western Finland were also drafted to war. In threatened areas, all people over 15 years of age were called to arms, and in addition, German mercenaries and people from Sweden arrived in the country. The Russian attacks stretched from Karelia to Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Tavastia. Peace was made in 1497. In the same year, the Privy Council of Sweden deposed Sten Sture as regent. However, the Finnish slottsläns remained under his control. A civil war followed, where King John beat the regent's troops, becoming King of Sweden himself (1497–1501). In 1499, Sture had to renounce his areas in Finland. In 1503, Svante Nilsson Sture (reigned 1504–1512) was elected as regent, and the Finnish leaders swore their loyalty to him. In a meeting held in Turku, the people showed their support for his position. However, the unanimity was only specious, as part of the leaders of Finland supported their own political standpoint together with Sten Sture's family. Their goals have remained somewhat unclear. However, national history has emphasised the role of eastern politics in the disagreements. The age of Vasa (1523–1617) =The reign of Gustav Vasa= The final battles of the union Gustav I (Vasa) of Sweden A drawing of Mikael Agricola by Albert Edelfelt. No contemporary images of Agricola remain. The final times of the union were a time of unrest in most of Finland, not only in Vyborg. In the late 16th century, the Danish went on pillages on the Finnish coast, and the pirate captain Otto Rudi robbed Turku and its cathedral's treasures. As the Danish union king Christian II of Denmark came to power, in his coronation he had tens of Swedish noblemen beheaded. This was called the Stockholm Bloodbath. The Swedish nobleman Gustav Vasa rose up to oppose the union king and won the peasants on his side. The German Hanseatic merchants also supported Gustav Vasa and provided him with weapons and money. The Finnish-born brothers Erik and Ivar Fleming conquered the Finnish castles for Gustav Vasa and drove the Danish away from Finland in 1523. The age of the Nordic union came to an end, and Gustav Vasa became king of Sweden and Finland. An early modern state is born During the reign of Gustav Vasa, a continuous Swedish realm started to form. He managed to suppress the regional communities who had been driving their own politics. In turn, the reformation suppressed the church. The high nobility, already weakened by the bloodbath, was now attached to support royal politics. However, the governing was still done in the medieval tradition: the king had numerous noblemen and scribes to help him, but these were not really officials. Also the government did not have a clear distinction of jobs, but tasks under the king's service changed according to the situation. In the 1530s, Gustav Vasa started to bring in German government officials to the country, along with whom new visions of royal power arrived in Sweden. During the 1544 Västerås Diet, the royalty was changed to hereditary and Gustav Vasa's eldest son Erik was named heir to the throne. The crown's local government concentrated in the hands of officials after land grants had been revoked. Their jobs were numerous, but collecting taxes was one of the most important ones. During Gustav Vasa's reign, tax collecting switched to literal government; first, systematic land documents (of ownership of land) were kept to help in taxation, other kinds of catalogues and literal accounts soon followed. The officials were also responsible for repopulating vacated houses, providing transport and roads. The officials also had to prevent illegal trade and handwork practiced in the countryside. Also overall peacekeeping and justice work belonged to the officials' dutiesthis way the crown's share of tax and fine income could be secured. Enhancing government raised the crown's tax income by tens of percents. The war against Russia Continuing conflicts with Russia were still significant in Finnish foreign politics. In the start of Gustav Vasa's reign, negotiations were held in an attempt to regain an idea of where the borderline went. The Swedish tried to postpone checking the borderline for as long as possible, and despite temporary agreements, conflicts and raids on both sides continued. In a nobility meeting held in Vyborg in 1555, the king was advised to go to war. The attack resulted in a counter-attack by Ivan the Terrible from the direction of Vyborg and Savonia. Negotiations held from 1556 to 1557 resulted in an interim peace lasting 40 years. There was a plan to hold a new negotiation about the borderline in 1559, but this never happened. Misconduct by the nobility In war times, the king had spent a long time in Finland. There he ordered an extensive investigation of misconduct by the nobility. This investigation resulted in the so-called Jakob Teit complaint list, which is a significant source of community history in the 16th century. In summer 1556, the king made Finland into its own duchy, and named his son John as its ruler. Gustav Vasa died in September 1560. Erik XIV of Sweden succeeded him on the throne. =From throne conflicts to the start of great power politics= The reign of Erik XIV Eric XIV Erik XIV was crowned as king in 1561. He attempted to strengthen the monarchy even more in regard to the nobility and also to his brothers. To weaken their position, Erik founded new counties and baronships to divide the power of dukes. In Finland, the king's politics also resulted in new lawspeakers being appointed to the country. In 1561 the king approved the so-called Arboga articles at a diet, which submitted the dukes to the king's control and stripped them of a chance for independent foreign politics. Destroying the position of John, the duke of Finland, was important to the king. As John's duchy, Finland became a \\"feudal minicountry\\" subject to the realm, with its own chancery, tax chamber and council, which could be compared to a state council. John's prerogatives in Livonia were also in conflict with the king: through a planned marriage with Catherine Jagiellon, John could receive numerous castles under his power in Livonia. At the same time, Erik XIV was being driven to war with Poland because of his expansion politics directed at Livonia. In 1561, the Tallinn city council had already given the city to the protection of the king, and during the same spring the Virumaa and Harjumaa nobility also resigned from the German knighthood. The struggle for power After the conflict had intensified, the king assembled a diet in 1563, where John was sentenced to death. The development led to the siege of the Turku Castle in summer 1563. After conflicts and bombardments, the castle surrendered on 12 August 1563, after which the luxury of the castle was destroyed, the duke and his wife were arrested and sent to Sweden for imprisonment. In the 1560s, Swedish foreign policy was marked by war against Poland in the Baltics. As well as this, Erik XIV was driven to war against Denmark-Norway and Lübeck. This required good relations to the east: concentrating military forces elsewhere required good relations towards Moscow. Erik XIV's era ended in 1568 after the nobility rose up against the king. This time even the Finnish nobility was on the side of the rebels, both old supporters of John and Erik's trusted men. The Turku Castle fell under the power of the rebels. Erik spent the next years in prison, until he was sentenced to death and poisoned in 1577. The long wrath John III. A painting by Johan Baptista van Uther from 1582. The king is dressed according to the latest court fashion from Spain. Under the reign of John III of Sweden, the border conflicts at the border of Käkisalmi county led to a new war (1570–1595), which is now known as the \\"25-year war\\". It was mostly a brutal war with guerilla warfare on both sides. In its beginnings, the war was well organised, and there was a truce on the Finnish front from 1573 to 1577. In the middle of the decade the peasant conflicts started again: the Karelians attacked in the direction of Oulujärvi and Iijoki, forces from Southern Finland travelled across the Gulf of Finland. At the end of the decade, organised warfare started again with an attack to Narva (1579) and the conquest of Käkisalmi in 1580. Narva was conquered the next year, after which negotiations led to an interim peace lasting until the year 1590. Despite the interim peace, guerilla warfare continued on both sides of the eastern border, which led to Kainuu and Northern Ostrobothnia being largely deserted in the 1580s. Led by Pekka Vesainen, the Ostrobothnians made vengeance trips to Viena Karelia. The war ended in 1595 with the Treaty of Teusina. A new struggle for the throne After John III died in 1592, the throne was left vacant. There were two candidates for his successor: Sigismund and the duke Karl. The question of the monarchy was entwined with the church politics: in the time of the counter-reformation in Europe Sigismund was a Catholic, which made his position even more problematic in the Lutheran Sweden. In 1593, Sigismund arrived in the country to be crowned. He gave his oath as a ruler in the autumn of the next year. At the same time, he accepted the Lutheran line of the Uppsala estate and church meeting (1593). With Sigismund's coronation, a personal union between Sweden and Poland, lasting a few years, was born; Sigismund was king of Poland until 1632. After the king returned to Poland, conflicts arose among the nobility about Karl's position as a regent. In this conflict, Finland's leader Klaus Fleming sided with the king. At the Arboga diet in 1597, Karl was still named as regent. At this time, he declared his opponents, especially Klaus Fleming, to be rebels. Justice becomes stricter In general, secular courts in Europe during the start of the New Age in the 16th and 17th centuries started using the so-called \\"Law of Moses\\", that is to say, some parts of the Bible. According to the Law of Moses, witchcraft and magic was forbidden, and for example blasphemy, swearing, betraying one's parents, perjury, killing, demanding too high interest, false testimony and numerous sexual crimes could be punished by death. The Law of Moses became a general guide of justice in the Swedish realm in 1608 and remained in force until the new law of the realm in 1734. However, the law was often not used to the full extent of its cruelty, and death penalties were replaced with lesser penalties in about half of the cases.Nenonen, Marko; Kervinen, Timo: Finnish witch trials in synopsis (1500-1750) =The peasant unrest in the 16th century and the Cudgel War= Unrest increased among the peasants during Gustav Vasa's reign, because of both heightened taxes and the struggle for power amongst his sons. The unrest resulted in the Cudgel War from 1596 to 1597. It ended bloodily, with the army beating the Ostrobothnian and Savonian peasants, armed by cudgels, spears and bows. The rebellion in Finland was directed at the nobility in power and especially at Klaus Fleming. The rebels sought help from the duke Karl who had been trying to usurp the throne. According to current research, the reasons for the rebellion included strain left from the 25-year war, financial setbacks and suffering caused by the castle camp system. Researchers disagree on how big an effect the duke Karl's leading the rebels against Klaus Fleming had on the outbreak of the Cudgel War.Katajala, Kimmo: Miksi nuijasota syttyi Pohjanmaalla?Ylikangas, Heikki: Nuijasota, 1997, pp. 358–359. . The Great Power age (1611–1721) =The Treaty of Stolbovo= Development of Sweden as a Great Power From 1604 to 1611, the duke Karl of Södermanland was king Charles IX of Sweden. During his reign, the realm was almost constantly at war with Russia and Poland, especially about the ownership of the Baltic lands of Estonia and Livonia. Also, a war with Denmark was fought from 1611 to 1613, resulting in a loss for Sweden. After Charles IX died, his son Gustav II Adolf inherited the throne. The realm was in a bad state and Sweden had to sign a peace treaty with Denmark in 1613. The Treaty of Stolbovo was signed with Russia in 1617, which resulted in the Käkisalmi county, Nöteborg and part of Ingria being annexed into Sweden. =Modernisation and renewals= Under the leadership of the king and the chancellor of state Axel Oxenstierna, significant renewals were made in Sweden and Finland once the foreign political situation had calmed down. The army and the military organisation were reorganised especially based on the model of the Dutch Mortis of Orania. The realm received a new form of government and was divided into counties. Also, a Governor General was appointed to Finland in the 17th century to improve the conditions in the country. Governor Generals of Finland included Niels Bielke and count Per Brahe the Younger, whose official residence was the Turku Castle. During the superpower age, new cities were founded in Finland, as well as the Turku court of justice and in 1640, Finland's first university, the Royal Academy of Turku. =The Thirty Years' War= Victory by Gustav II Adolf in the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631 In the Baltics, Sweden was still at war with Poland, and in 1629 the temporary Truce of Altmark was made. In Germany, Gustav II Adolf joined the Thirty Years' War between the Catholic emperor and the Protestant princes in 1630 after making landfall in Northern Germany. Sweden's aim in the war was to support the German Protestants and strengthen its own position. However, Gustav II Adolf died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632 and his daughter Christina succeeded him on the throne while still a minor. In practice, the realm was ruled by a caretaker government led by Axel Oxenstierna. In the Peace of Westphalia that had ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Sweden secured its position as a superpower. However, the Thirty Years' War and other conflicts in the superpower age drained Sweden's and Finland's resources badly. A significant part of the peasants had to serve in the army and the navy, and many of them died in service. =From the wars to the age of peace= During Christina's reign from 1632 to 1654, a large amount of lands were given as feudal lands to the nobility. The nobility had the right to collect taxes on their lands, which made the crown's financial position more difficult. After Christina had renounced the crown, Charles X Gustav of Sweden followed her on the throne and ruled over the Swedish realm from 1654 to 1660. Charles X died in 1660, and was followed by Charles XI of Sweden, during whose reign from 1660 to 1697, a large reduction was made, which returned most of the feudal lands to the crown. Charles XI weakened the power of the nobility and ruled the realm as an autocrat. Charles XI's reign meant a long time of peace for Finland. The Protestant clergy was responsible for teaching literacy to the people, and clerical life was dominated by religious purism. From 1695 to 1697 Finland was devastated by the Great Famine, which resulted in a significant part of the population dying of hunger and illnesses. =The Great Northern War= The Battle of Poltavaa painting by Denis Martens the Younger from 1726 During the reign of Charles XI's successor Charles XII of Sweden, the Great Northern War erupted in 1700, resulting in Sweden losing its superpower position. The cause of the war was an alliance against Sweden made by its enemies Denmark, Russia, Poland and Saxony. In the 1617 Treaty of Stolbovo, Russia had lost its connection to the Baltic Sea. The renovation- minded czar Peter the Great sought to reopen a connection to the Baltic Sea for Russia, so that its connections and trade to Western Europe would become easier. Although Charles XII managed to beat Denmark, Russia's attacking troops (in the Battle of Narva) and Poland, one at a time, the Swedish finally suffered a decisive defeat to the Russians in the Battle of Poltava in 1709. After this, the king fled to Turkey and the realm was open to an enemy attack. Vyborg was conquered in 1710, and the Russians occupied the rest of Finland after the Battle of Pälkäne in Pälkäne, the Battle of Storkyro in Ostrobothnia and the Battle of Gangut in front of Hanko by 1714. The Russian invasion period from 1714 to 1721 is commonly called the Greater Wrath. The occupation period was destructive to Finland. Thousands of people were killed and even more were sent to Russia, and a large part of the country's officials and clergy fled to Sweden. The Great Northern War and the Greater Wrath ended in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. In the treaty, Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, the Käkisalmi county and Vyborg were annexed to Russia. The part of Karelia annexed to Russia is commonly called Old Finland. Karl XII also spoke some Finnish with the Finnish part of the Swedish military. The Age of Liberty and the Gustavian Age (1721–1809) =Power away from the king= Sweden (Svealand, Götaland, Norland and Finland) after the Treaty of Turku, map from 1747 Gustav III of Sweden In the Swedish realm after Charles XII, the estates took power away from the king in the 1719 and 1720 governments and the age of autocracy changed into the age of estate rule (the \\"Age of Liberty\\"). Economy and science progressed during this age, but on the other side, power politics among parties caused problems. France and Russia gained power in Sweden by financing competing parties, which were called the Caps and the Hats. =The Hats' War= The Hats' rise to power in the 1738–1739 diet led to a Russophobic foreign policy, which was a disadvantage for Finland. An attack war against Russia, known as the Hats' War, erupted in 1741. Sweden suffered a defeat in the battle of Lappeenranta in the same year, and the later stages of the war fared no better for it. In 1742, the Swedish army withdrew from a Russian attack and surrendered. Russia occupied Finland again from 1742 to 1743. This occupation period is known as the Lesser Wrath. The Russian empress Elizabeth spread a manifesto in 1742, urging Finns to abandon Sweden and form an autonomous state protected by Russia. However, after the occupation of Finland, promises of autonomy stopped.Pieni tietosanakirja: Suomi, pp. 478–490. The occupation ended in the Treaty of Åbo. The occupation during the Lesser Wrath did not cause as much damage as the longer and more violent Greater Wrath a couple of decades earlier. =Thoughts in the new age= After the war, the mercantilist principles in the trade led to the financial gain from tar and shipbuilding being left in Stockholm. In 1760, Anders Chydenius, the vicar of Kokkola, started demanding freedom of trade and speech. During the last decades of the 18th century, interest to Finnish history and Finnish national poetry arose in the Royal Academy of Turku, especially because of Henrik Gabriel Porthan, the \\"father of Finnish history\\". Of the researchers, Eino Jutikkala says: \\"People in various regions and of various estates in Finland in the late 18th century consciously considered themselves as Finnish as opposed to the Swedish who lived on the other side of the sea.\\"Jutikkala- Pirinen: Kivikaudesta Koivistoon, 1989, pp. 194, 196, 205, the same in the 2002 edition. =The restless reign of Gustav III= In 1772, after Gustav III of Sweden had seized power, a new constitution was made, giving power back to the king. The age tried to get rid of mercantilism. Freedom of speech and freedom of religion expanded. Finnish officers trusted the king less, because the nobility lost their power to the king, who was supported by the people. Some high-ranking soldiers moved to serve in Russia. From 1788 to 1790, the so-called Gustav III's war, started by Gustav III, was fought between Sweden and Russia. Sweden was also confronted by Denmark. The officers in the Anjala conspiracy, among others, opposed the war. Despite a decisive marine victory at the Battle of Svensksund, Sweden did not gain any new territories in the Treaty of Värälä. The Union and Security Act of 1789 strengthened the king's power even more. With the war, the nobility grew even more bitter towards the king, and this eventually led to the king's murder in 1792. =Sweden loses Finland= The Finnish War was fought from 1808 to 1809 between Russia and Sweden. The reason for the war were the Treaties of Tilsit made between Russia and France on 7 July 1807. In the treaties, France and Russia had become allies and Russia had promised to pressure, with armed force if necessary, Sweden and other countries to join the Continental System against the United Kingdom, an embargo that France would have used to strengthen its position against the maritime power of the United Kingdom. The last Grand Duke of Finland during the Swedish era was Gustav IV Adolf's second son Karl Gustaf, who was born 1802 and died as an infant 1805.Juva, p. 114; Cederberg, A. R.: Suomen historia vapauden ajalla, I-II, 1942 and 1947. As a result of the Finnish War, Finland, the Åland islands, parts of Swedish Lapland and parts of Västerbotten, were ceded to Russia and became the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, within the Russian Empire and ruled by the Emperor of Russia as Grand Duke. Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, the last Swedish king of Finland, ironically was one of few Swedish kings to actually learn Finnish. He also became widely popular among the people in Finland when he 9 years old held a long speech in Finnish.

Life  Hage began his career as a journalist in 1975 as an editor for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, working initially for the Literature section and later for the newspaper's weekly “FAZ Magazin” colour supplement. From 1986 through to 1992 he was chief literary editor of another leading (West) German newspaper, Die Zeit, for which he subsequently has continued to write.http://www.zeit.de/schlagworte/personen/volker-hage/index Since 1992 he has worked on Der Spiegel where he has served as Culture Editor (“Redakteur im Kulturressort”).http://www.perlentaucher.de/autor/volker-hage.html He was the founder of the periodical “Deutsche Literatur” (“German Literature”), published by Reclam and he has produced various anthologies and collections. From 1988 through to 1994 Hage was a member of the jury for the annual Ingeborg Bachmann Prize contest, which is an event broadcast on television of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. More recently, in 2005 and 2006, he sat on the jury for the German Book Prize. Volker Hage has written biographies of Max Frisch, Walter Kempowski, John Updike, Philip Roth and (combined with Mathias Schreiber) of Marcel Reich-Ranicki. He has also been involved in rediscovering the ”realist” genre work of the writer Gert Ledig. This came during the course of Hage’s contributions to the debates, initiated by Max Sebald, about the literary treatment of the bombing of German cities during the Second World War. Hage was particularly effective as an advocate for Ledig’s second novel, Vergeltung, a powerfully apocalyptical and autobiographical anti-war narrative. In an engagingly two-edged assessment, fellow critic Marcel Reich- Ranicki wrote that Hage’s style of literary criticism had the great advantage that you always knew in advance precisely what he wanted to say.Hages… „Buchbesprechungen […] einen großen Vorzug haben: Man weiß immer genau, was er sagen will.“Marcel Reich-Ranicki: Die Sache mit dem Nobelpreis.

Regimental Band (1918) (Imperial War Museum) Japp was born in Liverpool and attended St John's College of the University of Oxford. After he graduated he worked in the offices of his father's shipping company in the City of London between 1904 and 1907. Whilst working in the City Japp studied at the night school of the Lambeth School of Art under Philip Connard. Japp studied at the Slade School of Art between 1908 and 1909, where he became friends with his fellow student Stanley Spencer and would often visit him in his home at Cookham in Berkshire. Japp specialised in landscape and figure paintings and exhibited with the New English Art Club of which he became a member in 1919. At the start of the First World War Japp joined the British Army and, eventually, became a Major in the Royal Field Artillery commanding an artillery battery in Macedonia, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. Coincidentally Spencer also served in Macedonia in the last years of the war and the British War Memorial Committee was keen for both men to be released from their military duties to work on paintings for the proposed, but never built, national Hall of Remembrance. The Army refused to release either of them until after the Armistice, when Japp, following a visit to the Western Front, began work on the painting The Royal Field Artillery in Macedonia, Spring 1918 (1919), which is now part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum. Shortly after the War Japp gave up painting professionally to farm and to breed race horses in Berkshire. Henry Lamb painted a group portrait of Japp and his family in 1928, which is now in Manchester Art Gallery. Japp left England in 1926 and for the next 27 years lived in France and Spain, before returning to England in 1953. He left England again to live in Portugal some years later.

It coincides with the New Year of many calendars. The Sangken festival is celebrated by the people of the Khampti tribe. The festival is also celebrated by Singpho, Tai Khamyang, Tangsa and of Arunachal Pradesh, and Tai Phake ,Tai Aiton and Tai Turung communities of Assam. Sangken generally falls in the month of 'Nuean Ha', the fifth month of the year of the Khamti Lunar calendar coinciding with the month of April. It is celebrated in the last days of the old year and the Lunar New Year begins on the day just after the end of the festival.  New Year Traditions  The main attraction of the festival is splashing clean water, which is the symbol of peace and purity. The images of Buddha are taken out and after the ceremonial bath. The procession is accompanied by drums, dances and enjoyment. The holy bath of lord Buddha is an auspicious event in the festival. The celebration takes place for three consecutive days. During the celebration the locals make homemade sweet and distribute them. The exchange of gifts is also a common trait of the festival. There are festivals other than Sangken celebrated throughout the year calendar. Some of the festivals are namely: POI-PEE-MAU (Tai or Dai New Year), MAI-KASUNG-PHAI, KHAO-WA, POAT-WA, etc. Every festive occasion or celebration of the Buddhist people revolves around the principles and teachings of Lord Buddha. All its socio-cultural activities have been truly religious. The essence of festivals lies in bringing people together and spreading the intrinsic values of their cultures and traditions. Being followers of Lord Buddha, the Buddhist people are lovers of peace and harmony. Thus, Sangken has always unfolded the message of peace, harmony and unity. Their decency and craftsmanship and their cuisine reveal their love and taste of food, while their sports show their adeptness in the art of games. The Tai Phakes is a lesser known Buddhist population of Assam. With its microscopic existence of less than 2000 souls, they mostly dwell in villages. In a constantly changing world they have tried to keep up, all the while trying to maintain their ways of life, tradition and culture.  The Three Days  Before the beginning of the Sangken festival, a temporary shrine called 'Kyongfra' is constructed for keeping the idols of Buddha during Sangken. In this Kyongfra during Sangken, clean water is sprinkled through a specially designed water fountain called the 'Lungkong'. Clean and scented water poured through the fountain is sprinkled over the idols of Buddha kept inside the Kyongfra. This water, which has washed the Gods, is collected as holy water by the devotees. Sangken festival is celebrated for three consecutive days. On the first day and at an auspicious time, the images of Lord Buddha are taken out of the shrine, given a ceremonial bath and placed in the 'Kyongfra’ to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals. People pray, offer sweets and food as offerings in the temple and then distribute sweets and goodwill amongst all by pouring water over each other. Water is also poured over all the holy objects, including the Boddhi tree, the Sailiks ropes of the holy book), Chausangphau- upuk and the Sammukathing. Water is also poured on Bhikkhus (monk) to invoke their blessings for good luck, good health, peace and harmony throughout the year. On the final day of the Sangken festival at the appointed time, the images are taken back to their original places and this marks the end of the old year. The Sangken festival marks a farewell to the old year and a warm welcome to the New Year. The New Year is welcomed with community prayers and feast during the ‘Poi Sangken’ celebrated after the end of the festival. This day is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm by all and marked by people going to the monastery to wash and clean up the shrine, idols and sprinkle holy water in the premises and a community feast which follows. This festival is dedicated to the worship of Lord Buddha so that he can bless mankind with prosperity.  Sangken elsewhere  Sangken is also seen to be celebrated abroad. Many Buddhist exist elsewhere where this festival is celebrated with enthusiasm. Sangken is celebrated as Songkran in other South East Asian countries. Songkran is a new year in the countries like Thailand, Laos, etc., while the Tai Phake celebrate Sangken to invoke the blessings of the lord Buddha for protection of the mankind from the evils, for peace, harmony, good luck and good health.

It debuted at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The concept is lower and larger than the Mazda 2. The ultra- futuristic interior probably won't make it production. The production version will rival the Hyundai i20, Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, Chevrolet Sonic, and the Ford Fiesta. The price of the Mazda 2 is estimated at under $20k. The manufacturer says that they designed the car \\"to look as if it is literally bursting with energy.\\" They revealed that the name Hazumi means \\"to bound or spring up.\\" AutoWeek says taking away the show room interior, heavy looking wheels and centered twin exhaust pipes and you would have a close to production look. Features The Hazumi uses the Kodo (Soul of Motion) design theme. It has large 18 in alloy wheels. The Hazumi's lopsided trapezoidal shaped screen displays Mazda's infotainment system, MZD. The driver will get access to Internet radio, social media platforms, text messaging, and more. A heads up display (HUD) probably won't be included to keep costs down. The 4 bucket seats won't be included either. Mechanicals The engine is a 1.5L SkyActiv-D Turbo diesel I4. Mazda actually underestimated the engine's fuel consumption. They estimated 6.4L per 100 km while the actual fuel economy is 3.5L per 100 km. The emission figures are 90g of CO2 emitted per km.

Poland does have an amateur rugby league national team, however there are no teams playing this form of rugby in Poland and therefore there is no governing body for rugby league. History The Polish Rugby Union (Polski Związek Rugby) was founded in 1957, although rugby had already existed in Poland since the 1920s, when in 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called \\"The White Eagles\\". The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side. There was, however, an earlier Polish Rugby Union set up in the early 1920s, but disbanded in 1928, as the sport failed to gain much popularity and historical disruptions such as World War II and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact halted development, which why it was not until the 1950s that the sport re-emerged. Poland's first ever rugby season was in 1956 between September and December. There was no national league but only 5 regional divisions which were meant to determine who shall play in the top flight which was to be established later on. PZR joined the IRFB in 1988.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p72 The official supplier of equipment to the PRU is O'Brien sport. In 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called \\"The White Eagles\\". The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side. The game became established in the Warsaw Military Academy in the early 1930s. The tragic events of World War II, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact etc., meant that the growth of Polish rugby was retarded until the 1950s. During World War II, there were occasional games between allied POWs in German camps in Poland.Cotton, p20 For example, a game was held between a Scottish and a Welsh XV, in ten inches of snow. No conversions were allowed, as the ball would have gone over the camp fence, and the game was twenty minutes each way. Players wore army boots, trousers, prison shirts and balaclavas. Polish rugby arguably achieved its greatest success in the late 1970s when the national team beat Italy, Spain and the USSR, and also held Romania to a 37–21 win in 1977. :\\"Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins. Russia emerged from behind the Iron Curtain and came under international scrutiny when they played France in Toulouse in November 1978. Rumania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur, the governing body for those countries not in the IB.\\"Hopkins, John (ed) Rugby (1979 ), p8 In 1983, Poland failed to play in the FIRA Championships, and told FIRA that two of their players had died.Cotton, p29 It is not known where the other died, but one had died near Bucharest. The Cold War frequently intruded – for example in the 1984 FIRA Championships, in the game against France, Poland demanded the removal of the French players Didier Camberabero, Henri Sanz and the Brive RFC centre Yves Fouget, because as members of the French armed forces, they were considered to be a security risk. Because of high Polish emigration, particularly to France, and English speaking nations, the Polish team actually has a fairly large pool of potential players. In addition, a number of Poles returning from jobs in the British Isles and France, have carried the game back with them. There are currently three divisions in Poland. The second division was relaunched in 2009 using some of the major teams providing 2nd XVs, along with some newly formed sides.

There is now also a regional league played in the centre of Poland (around Lodz and Warsaw) in which some smaller clubs have entered teams and second teams from some of the top clubs nationally compete.

Her moving image work is known for its preoccupation with form and its interplay between abstraction and narration. Education Turner studied Fine Art, Film and Video at St Martin’s School of Art in the late eighties, followed by an MA at the Slade School of Fine Art. Career =Academic Work= Turner has lectured at the University of Kent since 2002, first as senior lecturer in film studies then was appointed director of fine art in 2012. =Film practice= Turner describes her work as \\"characterized by explorations of technologies, experimental approaches to writing and an engagement with experiences of narrative, immersion and embodiment within the long form film\\" with the governing aesthetic of \\"the space between abstraction and narration and working around affect\\" Recent long form works have been supported by Film London Artists' Moving Image Network (FLAMIN) and Arts Council England. Early interest in alternative media and storytelling Turner has long been interested in storytelling methods and devices, and it was an interest in literature that originally propelled her interest in language: ideas expressed in time and space, which led to her work in film. In 2004, she was the writer in residence at the University of York, and also the recipient of a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council in order to investigate and produce an ‘alternative to a script-based filmmaking practice through an innovative, location-based process that exploits the responsive potential of digital video technologies’. Following this, she wrote an article concerning her own processes in developing Ecology (then titled The Mills) and the industry’s attitude to scriptwriting more generally, which has been archived by Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design’s British Artists' Film and Video Study Collection project. For the Birds Eye View Film Festival 2008, Turner orchestrated an ‘innovative cinematic symphony of women's voices from around the world’ in an interactive mobile phone filmmaking project. The project invited participants to engage by making a quick film on a mobile phone, on the theme ‘overheated’. A live edit took place at the Institute of Contemporary Art with sound designer Annabelle Pangbourn. The completed project is available on the project’s site: overheatedsymphony.blogspot.co.uk. Major works =Perestroika= Turner’s 2009 feature film Perestroika mixed 20-year-old Hi8 footage with animated recent digital stills, and was itself reworked for the 2013 film perestroika:reconstructed. Unusually for a film noted for its challenges to its audience, Perestroika attracted the attention of mainstream film critics, from whom it received highly favourable coverage. Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times awarded four stars to ‘a travelogue with philosophical trimmings [which] turns into a puzzle picture worthy of Resnais or Antonioni’. The film critic Peter Bradshaw writing in The Guardian described her 2009 work Perestroika, \\"challenging art film is a stream of consciousness memory-jogger\\". It was the Sight and Sound Film of the Month, about which the critic Chris Darke wrote, \\"As physically immersive as anything you’re likely to see at a 3D multiplex, Perestroika sets its coolly minimalist structure against a visceral emotional tone to produce a work unlike any other in current British cinema.\\" Perhaps the reason for the appeal of Turner’s work outside the art world is that it pushes the boundaries of both film and politics. Perestroika has been noted by academics and critical thinkers for both its artistic form and commentary on environmental and social issues, most notably featuring in the essay volumes Performing Authorship: Self inscription and corporeality in the cinema and Screening Nature: Cinema Beyond the Human. For Cecilia Sayad, the film’s importance lies in its structures: its function in highlighting the act of authorship as performance, and how the film’s structural devices serve to emphasise the fictionality of narration, how the retelling, even of truth or fact, always and necessarily involves an element of creation and thus fiction. Sayad comments that whilst Perestroika ostensibly interweaves footage of a 2007–08 reconstruction of a train journey across Siberia that Turner took in 1987–88 with that from the original journey in what was then the USSR, it is as much about the workings of memory and filmmaking itself. But Sophie Mayer has commented on how the work uses the idea of pollution as a function of retention, and weaves it through both the social/cultural and natural worlds. Mayer goes further in exploring the contextual importance of the work, comparing Perestroika with works of the filmmakers Lucrecia Martel and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, commenting that each offers a ‘utopian possibility of a post-capitalist, post- industrial, postcolonial moment’. In a booklet of essays written to accompany the publication of Perestroika and perestroika:reconstructed in 2014, another academic, Paul Newland writes ‘the artist explores the nature of representation and its problematical relationship to our experience of reality. By doing this the film travels the branch lines between cinematography, photography, and everyday life.’ =Public House= Public House, 96 mins, premiered in the Documentary competition, LFF 2015, nominated for the Grierson Awards. Public House was re-mastered in 2016 for wider audiences and toured UK cinemas and galleries throughout 2017. Writing for the BFI's Sight and Sound, critic Sophie Mayer commented “Its combination of the choreographic and choral offer a dazzlingly unique form in which to make the collective cinematic”. Influences As a student, Turner was mentored by the artists Tina Keane and Lis Rhodes. Like Rhodes, Turner was involved in the women’s film distributors, Circles and later Cinenova, where she had access to much early women’s and feminist moving image work. She has also stated that her influences include Black Audio Film Collective, Sankofa and Isaac Julien’s subsequent works. =Curatorial= In the early nineties, Turner curated for the Tate gallery, programmed the monthly avant garde showcase at the National Film Theatre (now BFI Southbank), and devised a touring programme of artists’ moving image work for the Arts Council of England ‘Hygiene and Hysteria: The body desired and the body debased’ in conjunction with fellow filmmaker Ian Iqbal Rashid, featuring such artists as Michael Brynntrup, Kayla Parker, John Grayson and Anna Thew. In 1997 she co- curated the launch of the Lux Cinema in Hoxton, east London with artist and academic Jon Thomson. In the four month launch programme collaborations with communities and other art forms plus explorations into political and technological change featured heavily alongside original commissioned moving image works. Since 2008, Turner has been a founding member of a curatorial group, Hysteriography, which is composed of British female filmmakers, writers and curators.

Hall was disqualified for a low blow in the thirteenth of a scheduled twenty rounds. Mason was later recognized in September 1923 by the European Broadcasting Union as European champion. He travelled to the United States in 1924 for a series of fights before returning to England towards the end of the year. In April 1925 he fought Lucien Vinez in Paris to decide who would challenge for the world title, but the match ended in a draw. Mason met fellow Jewish boxer Philadelphian Harry \\"Kid\\" Brown at the Pioneer Sporting Club in New York on 15 January 1924, winning in a ten- round points decision. Mason showed fine footwork and a careful defence. After a slow first four rounds, Mason began to land on Brown's midsection frequently, and easily rolled away from Brown's punches. Mason's punch was not considered particularly strong by American standards.\\"Lightweight of Britain Victor at the Pioneer\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 23, 16 January 1924 On 12 February 1924, Mason defeated Herb Brodie in a twelve- round points decision at New York's Pioneer Sporting Club.

Defence of lightweight titles In June 1925 he fought British champion Ernie Izzard in a defence of his British and European lightweight titles at Holland Park Rink in Kensington, and won when Izzard failed to return to the ring after the eighth round. In his first trip to the canvas, a right uppercut from Mason put Izzard down for a count of nine in the eighth. When he arose, Mason put him to the canvas again with a few wild swings.

Though he took a serious beating in a decisive loss, Mason remained on his feet throughout the bout, after having some trouble in the first. His third round was his best, but in the majority of rounds, Freeman appeared to deliver three times the number of blows as Mason. A Depression crowd of only 5,000 attended the Garden's bout, having limited interest in the foreign challenger to Freeman.\\"Mason's Powder Puff Style of Boxing Proves Showy\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 18, 19 August 1927 Mason had his first bout in South Africa against Oscar Jacobsohn in Johannesberg on 9 May 1929, winning a ten-round points decision. Mason would continue to box in South Africa through September 1929, though the bouts garnered limited newspaper coverage. He would eventually make his home in South Africa after his retirement from the ring. In an important career bout, Mason lost to former world welterweight champion Joe Dundee on 28 May 1930, in a ten-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. A crowd of only 5,000 showed up to see the bout. In his first showing in America, Mason caught Dundee on the chin in the opening of the first round, but somehow Dundee made it through to the bell, recovering well by the second. After the first, where Mason made his great opening, Dundee was required to rally in the remaining rounds to take the lead in points. To Mason's credit, there were no knockdowns in their exciting semi-final bout fought at the Garden, New York's shrine to boxing.\\"Slow Bout is Won By Coast Lad\\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 21, 29 May 1930 Mason drew with well-known American boxer James \\"Red\\" Herring in a ten-round points decision on 29 July 1930 in Utica, New York. Mason suffered financial problems in 1931 after his former manager Joseph Morris successfully took him to court a year earlier for breach of contract, claiming that he had signed an exclusive contract to fight for him; At the time his debts were estimated at £450–500, and his assets £91. In November 1931 he won a final eliminator against George Rose to earn another shot at the British welterweight title, but didn't get to fight for the title until June 1934, after winning an eliminator against Danny Evans. In November 1932, he fought Ernie Rice at the Royal Albert Hall with his British and European lightweight titles at stake, winning on points over 20 rounds.Wechsler, Bob (2007) Day By Day in Jewish Sports History, KTAV, , p. 163, 326 =British welter champion again= He regained the British Welterweight title with a win over Len \\"Tiger\\" Smith on 11 June 1934 after an eleventh round disqualification at the Embassy Rink in Birmingham, England, the title having been vacated by Jack Hood. A run of defeats followed, culminating in the loss of his British welterweight title to Pat Butler in a fifteen-round decision in Leicester, England on 17 December 1934. He continued to fight until 1937, losing his final fight to Jack Kid Berg. His career record included 145 wins (26 by knockout) from 215 fights. Mason was known for his showmanship, and often played violin or recited poetry from the ring before a fight. In 1926 he appeared in vaudeville at the Holborn Empire, singing, dancing, and conducting the Miami Band. Mason's last fight on 21 February 1937 was a third-round technical knockout loss to former world junior welterweight champion Harry \\"Kid\\" Berg at The Ring, in Southwark. Mason was down in the first round, and could not return to the ring for the fourth round bell. =Boxing retirement= Mason was engaged to Violet Hilton for a time, subsequently having a relationship with her conjoined twin sister Daisy.Frost, Linda (2009) Conjoined Twins in Black and White: The Lives of Millie-Christine McKoy and Daisy and Violet Hilton, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 14 Following his boxing retirement in 1937, Mason accepted an offer to manage a Hotel in South Africa, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died in South Africa on 27 August 1977 at the age of 74.

In a bid to recoup its costs, it started charging airlines for providing this service. ACNZ gave Geyserland notice informing it that it was now subject to their \\"standard terms of contract\\", which included a term for the charging of landing fees, and they were subsequently invoiced for air control fees. Geyserland refused to pay the charges, as they claimed they did not agree to any contract with them, even though they continued to request air traffic control services from ACNZ at the Rotorua airport. They pointed out that ACNZ were required by law to provide air traffic control services under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1953. Left with no other option, ACNZ sued Geyserland for the unpaid landing fees. Held The Court ruled that as Geyserland had not accepted Airways contract, there was no legally binding contract between the two parties. NOTE: The Court stated obiter, that Airways may have been successful if they had sued under Quantum Meruit i.e. they benefited from the improved air safety.

He helped transform radiocarbon dating from a simple tool for archaeology and geology to a precise technique with applications in solar physics, oceanography, geochemistry, and carbon dynamics. Minze Stuiver’s research encompassed the use of radiocarbon (14C) to understand solar cycles and radiocarbon production, ocean circulation, lake carbon dynamics and archaeology as well as the use of stable isotopes to document past climate changes.  Biography  Professor Minze Stuiver in his office in the Quaternary Isotope Lab at the University of Washington in 1998 Minze Stuiver was born in Vlagtwedde, the Netherlands, in 1929. As a boy he narrowly missed being taken into German forced labor toward the end of the Second World War, but, because he was away delivering milk by bicycle, he escaped the round-up that took most of the young men and older boys from the village. His secondary school education was disrupted by the war when the school was occupied by German soldiers and air raids interrupted classes in makeshift rooms. After the war he went to the University of Groningen where he studied physics, mathematics and astronomy, focusing on nuclear physics. After graduation he joined the biophysics group led by the pre-eminent researcher Hessel de Vries and received a Ph.D. in Biophysics in 1958 with a thesis on the Biophysics of the Sense of Smell.Stuiver, M. Biophysics of the Sense of Smell. Ph.D. thesis. Groninger University, Groningen, the Netherlands. Shortly thereafter he began working in the rapidly developing field of radiocarbon dating with de Vries, who found variations in the concentration of radiocarbon in the atmosphere which challenged the assumptions of the radiocarbon dating method. In 1959, together with his wife, Anneke, Minze went to Yale University for a one-year fellowship position but was called back to Groningen to take over as director of the radiocarbon facility when De Vries died.Stuiver, M. (2009). \\"A Random Walk Through Time.\\" Radiocarbon 51(1): 291-300. However Minze chose to remain in the United States at the Geochrometric Laboratory at Yale University. There he developed high precision methods in radiocarbon that enabled him, along with Hans Suess, to verify De Vries’ “wiggly” nature of the atmospheric concentration of radiocarbon in the past from tree-rings. Stuiver and Suess created one of the first curves for calibration of radiocarbon dates.Stuiver, M. and H. E. Suess (1966). \\"On the relationship between radiocarbon dates and true sample ages.\\" Radiocarbon 8: 534-540. In 1969 Minze moved to the newly founded Quaternary Research Center at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle. There he built the Quaternary Isotope Lab with a lead-lined room 30 feet below ground to shield the hand-built gas counters from detecting spurious events due to cosmic rays. In the 1970s Minze began measuring 14C in dissolved inorganic carbon in ocean water as part of The Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS) to study the distribution of carbon in the ocean.Stuiver, M. and S. W. Robinson (1974). \\"University of Washington Geosecs North Atlantic carbon-14 results.\\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters 23: 87-90. Stuiver, M., H. G. Ostlund, et al.

In addition he was involved in a number of studies on the glacial histories of Antarctica and North America.Stuiver, M., C. J. Heusser, et al. (1978). \\"North-American glacial history extended to 75,000 years ago.\\" Science 200(4337): 16-21.Stuiver, M., G. H. Denton, et al.

He was the senior editor of the journal Radiocarbon from 1977-1988 and broadened the scope of the publication to include articles about scientific knowledge derived from radiocarbon measurements. By then the terminology for various ways to calculate and present radiocarbon data was becoming rather confusing. Together with Henry Polach, he formulated the equations and conventions for reporting radiocarbon data that is still widely used.Stuiver, M. and H. A. Polach (1977). \\"Reporting of C-14 data - Discussion.\\" Radiocarbon 19(3): 355-363. His work investigating atmospheric 14C changes gave rise to a greater understanding of the changes in solar activity over time and potential links to climate change as well as the extent of fossil fuel input.Stuiver, M. and P. D. Quay (1978). \\"Solar variability and C-14 isotope stages.\\" Transactions- American Geophysical Union 59(12): 1154-1154. Stuiver, M. and P. D.

In the mid-1980s he led the development of the first high precision radiocarbon calibration curve extending back nearly 10,000 years ago based on 14C measurements of tree-rings with known calendar ages from dendrochronology.Stuiver, M. and R. S. Kra, Eds. (1986). Radiocarbon: Calibration Issue. New Haven, Connecticut, The American Journal of Science. This data still forms the backbone of the Holocene portion of the current international radiocarbon calibration curve which is used by archaeologists and geoscientists around the world.Reimer, P. J., E. Bard, et al. (2013). \\"IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0-50,000 years cal BP.\\" Radiocarbon 55(4): 1869–1887. He also oversaw the development of the CALIB computer software to automate the calibration process.Stuiver, M. and P. J. Reimer (1986). \\"A Computer-Program for Radiocarbon Age Calibration.\\" Radiocarbon 28(2B): 1022-1030.Stuiver, M. and P. Reimer (1989). \\"Histograms Obtained from Computerized Radiocarbon Age Calibration.\\" Radiocarbon 31(3): 817-823. In the 1990s, in addition to continued work on radiocarbon calibration and solar variability, he began work on oxygen isotopes from Greenland ice cores together with Pieter Grootes. Their sub-annual resolution stable isotopes measurements provided confirmation of the rapid nature of major climatic changes at the end of the last glaciation.Stuiver, M., P. M. Grootes, et al. (1995). \\"The GISP2 δ18O Climate Record of the Past 16,500 Years and the Role of the Sun, Ocean, and Volcanoes.\\" Quaternary Research 44(3): 341-354. Stuiver, M. and P. M.
