It is located at 110 West Cross Street in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  History  The Michigan Firehouse Museum is located in Ypsilanti's former fire station, which was built in the city's Depot Town neighborhood in 1898 and remained in service until 1975. That year, the city built a new station and sold the old one to a family who lived in the building. In 1998, the old station was purchased by Ann Arborites Howard and Norma Weaver, who then opened the museum that same year. The Michigan Firehouse Museum and Education Center was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1999. In 2005, it was the only fire museum in the state open year-round as well as the closest one to Metro Detroit. The present museum consists of the former fire station as well as a modern, multilevel addition that together combine for a total of . The addition was built in 2002. The museum is a component of the MotorCities National Heritage Area, which is grant-funding a mortar-restoration project on the original fire station's brick exterior.  Exhibits  Exterior of the 2002 addition The Michigan Firehouse Museum's exhibits focus on fire fighting technology and fire fighting in Michigan. The museum collects firefighting equipment from around the state as well as archival materials. The modern addition to the Michigan Firehouse Museum provides space for 25 changing exhibits on the history of firefighting, which include antique fire trucks, equipment, and tools as well as firefighting memorabilia. The original fire station showcases a horse-drawn steam-powered fire engine. The museum is home to fire trucks from across the state, including those from Battle Creek, Escanaba, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Saline, and Scio Township. Highlights from the truck collection include a 1916 Triple Combination Pumper and a 1917 American LaFrance Type 31. By 2005, the museum was home to over 15 fire trucks, and by 2007 its collection had grown to more than 20 trucks. The museum is home to the largest collection of fire truck bells in the United States. It has a total of over 3,600 items on display, including rare fire grenades.  Visitors and events  The museum draws approximately 6,000 visitors annually. Its visitors include numerous schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, and former firefighters, and the museum has welcomed visitors from other fire museums from as far away as Dallas, Texas. In 2018, then-museum director Al Dyer Jr. opined that the museum was underutilized, as it was open to visitors only 16 hours per week. He also voiced his desire to develop relationships between the museum and other organizations and institutions in the community, especially Eastern Michigan University. Dyer conceived the museum as a fire safety and education center as well as an event venue for weddings and other events. By 2005, the museum was already hosting birthday parties and wedding receptions. In August 2010, the museum hosted Firetruck Muster, a fire truck show, at Riverside Park in Ypsilanti. In December 2018, the fire station, which is considered haunted by some paranormal investigators, hosted its inaugural Para-Con paranormal convention, featuring multiple panel discussions and a midnight ghost hunt.

In the late 2010s she investigated the Turkish dimension of the Paradise Papers affair. She has worked for the Cumhuriyet newspaper since late 2000s and reported on the Panama Papers in 2016, but she left her job in Cumhuriyet in the aftermath of her reporting on Paradise Papers affairs in Turkey, which also led to a defamation suit against her, criticized by several international organizations as an attack on freedom of speech and press. By the end of 2016, almost half of the paper's reporters, columnists and executives had been jailed by the Erdoƒüan government. Cumhuriyet has since shifted its stance to align more closely with the government, with a number of its journalists sued or resigning, and its former chief editor, Can D√ºndar, fleeing the country. Since 2018 she works as a freelancer mostly associated with Turkish-language version of the Deutsche Welle. Paradise Papers lawsuits The sons of Turkey's prime minister, Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, described as \\"close friends\\" of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, are listed in the papers as having business interests in tax havens. The sons, both doing maritime business, officially set up two companies in Malta, to avoid high Turkish tax rates. Both of the companies are registered under the names of the two sons, with the older son Erkam Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m having more shares than the younger son B√ºlent Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m in both companies. The companies, named Hawke Bay Marine Co. Ltd.(founded in 2004) and Black Eagle Marine Co. Ltd.(founded in 2007) are \\"active\\" in the available detailed data. One of the companies shared an address with a company that won a $7 million government contract. The brothers, although publicly acknowledging those facts, sued journalist Pelin √únker and the newspaper Cumhuriyet in 2018 after they published the story describing their involvement. In January 2019 a Turkish court sentenced √únker to thirteen months in jail for \\"defamation and insult of public official\\", and separately fined the newspaper for \\"insult\\". The ICIJ's director, Gerard Ryle, criticized the sentence as an attack on free speech. She is the only journalist in the world sentenced for writing about the Paradise Papers investigation. Her sentencing has also been criticized by others, including the Netherlands Helsinki Committee and PEN America. Her prison sentence was overturned on appeal due to a statute of limitations, but the fine was allowed to stand. √únker has also been sued by Berat Albayrak, Turkey's finance and treasury minister and the president's son-in-law, first over her reporting on him related to Panama Papers, and later, about his connection with the Paradise Papers revelations. Both of those lawsuits were also dismissed. The Netherlands Helsinki Committee concluded that \\"Because of her reporting on tax evasion schemes of Turkey's powerful, it is no longer possible for √únker to work in Turkish mainstream media\\", stressing the problems surrounding freedom of the press issues in Turkey. Following the incident, in March 2019 the One Free Press Coalition included her in the list of world's ten most endangered journalists. In April 2019 the Investigative Reporters and Editors awarded her the Don Bolles Medal for courage.

Prior, he served as Minister of Justice and Human Rights. He is considered a strong representative from the southern part of the country. Born in the southern region of Tacna, Zeballos began his political career as mayor of Mariscal Nieto Province in Moquegua, from 2003 to 2006. Subsequently he was elected to Congress in for the National Solidarity Alliance, representing Moquegua and Union for Peru. Zeballos was reelected in 2016, running in this occasion as an independent within Peruvians for Change. He left the parliamentary caucus in December 2017, in protest to the pardon granted to former president Alberto Fujimori by the leader of the party and then-president of Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. In Mart√≠n Vizcarra's administration, Zeballos was appointed Minister of Justice and Human Rights, serving in the position until his appointment as Prime Minister after Salvador del Solar's resignation due to the denied confidence given by Congress, prompting its constitutional dissolution. His tenure was marked by controversy and subject of extensive media scrutiny regarding his management skills, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Zeballos was succeeded in office by former Prime Minister Pedro Cateriano on July 15, 2020. Early life and education Vicente Antonio Zeballos Salinas was born on May 10, 1963, in Tacna, Peru, but was raised in the city of Moquegua. He completed his high school education at the Sim√≥n Bolivar School of Moquegua. He enrolled in the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega University, where he studied law and political science, attaining a law degree. He specialized in constitutional law at the Center for Constitutional Studies in Madrid, Spain. He pursued a PhD in constitutional law at the Complutense University of Madrid, but did not complete the degree. Career Zeballos started his political career by running for the Peruvian Congress in 2001 with the Union for Peru party representing the Moquegua constituency. Although not elected, he gained prominence in his region, gaining the mayorship of the Mariscal Nieto Province in 2002. He ran for reelection in 2006 and 2010, but was not elected. =Peruvian Congress (2011-2019)= In late 2010, former mayor Luis Casta√±eda of Lima started his full-scale presidential campaign. Recruiting regional leaders around the country, Zeballos was selected to run for Congress in the National Solidarity Alliance, which grouped Union for Peru in coalition with the National Solidarity Party, Always Together and Change 90. The alliance would attain 9 seats in Congress, with Zeballos elected representing Moquegua for the 2011-2016 term. In his term in office, he was considered a swing vote among regional representatives. He ran for the Presidency of Congress in 2015, losing to opposition congressman Luis Iberico N√∫√±ez. In 2016, he was invited to run for reelection under the Peruvians for Change congressional list of the Moquegua Region. He was successfully reelected for the 2016-2021 term. Serving in the cabinet as Minister of Justice and Human Rights, his term would be shortened due to the dissolution of Congress issued by president Vizcarra on September 30, 2019. =Minister of Justice and Human Rights (2018-2019)= On July 21, 2018, president Mart√≠n Vizcarra appointed him Minister of Justice, replacing the disgraced Salvador Heresi, who resigned amidst the political scandal involving the Supreme Court Justice, C√©sar Hinostroza. During his tenure, he was questioned before Congress twice. On March 14, 2019, with 8 votes in favor, 24 against, and one abstention, Congress approved the admission of a motion for appeal against Zeballos for him to report on the terms of the collaboration agreement with the Brazilian company Odebrecht, which was signed with the Public Ministry and the Attorney General. On August 15, 2019, Congress voted on the admission of a second motion for appeal against the minister to respond to the escape of the hitman William Moreno (a.k.a. \\"Goro\\"), hitman from former Governor of Ancash, C√©sar √Ålvarez's criminal network, and implicated in the death of former regional councilman, Ezequiel Nolasco and Hilda Saldarriaga. With 63 votes in favor, eight against and 21 abstentions, Zeballos was summoned on September 2 to answer a set of 12 questions regarding the case. On September 2, 2019, Zeballos attended Congress to answer the questions of the interpellation statement. The debate lasted more than four hours and was finally suspended by the President of Congress, Pedro Olaechea, without actually presenting a vote of no confidence. The minister denied having lied to the Justice Committee about the hitman's escape, and denied alleged rumors of wanting to divert attention from the criminal's escape. To his presentation, Zeballos also added the existence of responsibilities of both the National Penitentiary Institute (INPE) and the Judiciary. Premiership (2019-2020) On September 30, 2019, Zeballos was sworn as the new Prime Minister of Peru, succeeding Salvador del Solar, following the disputed attempt by Congress passing a no-confidence motion against the latter and his cabinet as a whole. The decree dissolving Congress was the first law signed by president Vizcarra and Zeballos as prime minister. On October 30, 2019, Zeballos presented, together with president Vizcarra, the main policies that his administration would advance in the following months: universal access to health services, an increase in the national minimum wage, fighting against violence against women, promoting public safety and education, and constructing two large airports. Prior to this, the government had declared that after the dissolution of Congress it would not be appropriate to present the measures of the ministerial cabinet before the Congressional Permanent Assembly, which had limited functions.Vizcarra: ¬´Se va a presentar este plan de trabajo, pero, no corresponde hacerlo ante la Comisi√≥n Permanente¬ª On May 19, 2020, the President of Congress, Manuel Merino, invited Zeballos to a face-to-face session of Congress in compliance with Articles 130 and 135 of the Constitution and Article 82 of the Rules of Congress. The first article establishes that within 30 days of taking office, the Cabinet must attend Congress, expose the government's general policy and the main measures that its management requires. Article 135 establishes that after the parliamentary interregnum, the Prime Minister must expose the acts of the Executive Branch during the period between the dissolution and the installation of the new Congress. Zeballos told the press that it is not appropriate to quote him based on article 130, as this cabinet \\"pre-exists\\" the new Congress. He indicated that he should only be called in application of 135 and criticized that a face-to-face session be held amid isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Hours later, the President of Congress pointed out that the Zeballos cabinet does not have the confidence of the previous Congress or the current one. Then, the Chairman of the Constitutional Committee of Congress, Omar Chehade, warned that if the Prime Minister does not request confidence, he would commit to contempt, and it would be possible for a constitutional accusation and censorship. On May 28, 2020, Zeballos went to request the vote of confidence with his cabinet. He obtained 89 votes in favor, 35 against, and 4 abstentions. Facing criticism regarding his tenure during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, Zeballos resigned on July 15, 2020. On the same day, Vizcarra appointed Pedro Cateriano as Zeballos' successor, marking the end of a 10-month tenure in cabinet leadership. = Controversies = On October 21, 2019, Zeballos referred to the possible candidacies of legislators from the recently dissolved congress, questioning whether they should be able to participate in the 2020 congressional elections, referring to the constitutional referendum of 2018 where the immediate re-election of parliamentarians had been specifically addressed. On November 14, 2019, Luis Carrasco, the president of the Special Electoral Jury for Lima Centro (Jurado Electoral Especial; JEE), opened an investigation into the prime minister for allegedly violating, through his statement to the press as a public official, the principle of electoral neutrality. In response, Zeballos questioned the legal basis for the JEE investigation On November 27, 2019, JEE closed their investigation of Zeballos. However, the body did move to censure Minister of Women and Vulnerable Populations, Gloria Montenegro, accusing her of the same infraction, although the motion did not prosper.

Early life  John Dewrance was born in 1858 at Peckham, London, the only son of pioneering locomotive engineer John Dewrance and his wife Elizabeth. Dewrance was educated at Charterhouse School before entering King's College, London, where he is said to have \\"paid special attention to chemistry\\".  Career  In 1879 Dewrence took over the running of Dewrance & Co. Ltd from his father. The following year he took over the research laboratory and staff of Professor Frederick Barff, where he experimented on protecting iron from rust. Dewrance built a formidable body of research early in his career, focussing particularly on lubrication, metallurgy and corrosion; this was reflected in his stints as Chairman of the Alloys Research Committee, Research Advisory Committee, Cutting Tools Research Committee as well as the Finance and House Committee of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. Dewrance went on to enjoy exceptional success as an inventor and mechanical engineer, taking out a total of 114 patents relating to steam fittings and boiler mountings. In 1889 he was elected Chairman of Babcock and Wilcox Ltd, and in 1914 Chairman of Deal and Walmer Coalfield Ltd and Kent Coal Concessions Ltd, holding all of these positions until his retirement in July 1937. Dewrance was engaged on Government contracts during the First World War, serving on committees of the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury. He was first knighted in 1920. Other major appointments for Dewrance included a tenure as President of the Engineering and Allied Employers' National Federation between 1920 and 1926, President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Master of the Armourers' and Brasiers' Company in 1923, High Sheriff of Kent in 1925, and President of the Institute of Metals between 1926 and 1928. Dewrance was made a Fellow of King's College in 1929, where he also sat on the Council until his retirement.  Personal life  King's College hall of residence Dewrance married Isabella Ann, granddaughter of inventor and mining engineer Richard Trevithick, in 1882. They had a son and a daughter. Dewrance enjoyed riding, shooting and deerstalking in his personal life, and was involved with the Primrose League. He was appointed KBE in 1920 and GBE in 1928.  Legacy  Dewrance & Co. Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Babcock & Wilcox Ltd following Dewrance's death in 1937. By sheer coincidence, the former Dewrance & Co. headquarters on Great Dover Street now forms part of a King's College hall of residence. The Sir John Dewrance prize is awarded to the two best mechanical engineering students each year at City, University of London.

It is usually found in regions with bodies of fresh water but can be found in almost every environment. It tends to form \\"hotspots\\" around specific areas. The species is distinguished by the size of its chromosomes and the lack of a proboscis.  Description  C. annularius has three defining characteristics in terms of physical structural. The first is the Johnston's Organ, a sensory organ embedded in its antennae. This sensory organ is used to detect other individuals of the same species and possible mates. The range of detection is no more than a centimeter; this small range requires the species to try mating on even the slightest hint that there's a female nearby. Green/Left = Higher Physical Fitness Blue/Right = Higher Reproductive Fitness Additionally, the species are characterized by a difference in size between large and small males. The larger males have higher longevity and can fly for more extended periods of time. This allows larger individuals to search for food and resources and succeed more in physical fitness. The smaller males are at a disadvantage physically, but they can more easily latch onto females in the air to mate. Thus, the reproductive fitness of smaller individuals is also high. Medium- sized males don't experience any of this benefit, and thus are not as populous. Lastly, there is a difference in wing spans and frequency of sound between males and females. This is due to the inverse relationship between the sound that the wing produces and wing length. For example, C. annularius males have shorter wingspans, which causes them to produce higher frequency sounds (434¬±27.8 Hz). On the other hand, females have longer wingspans, which causes them to produce lower frequency sounds (240¬±17.2 Hz). This allows males to differentiate between other males and possible mates.  Distribution  Great Lakes This species exists in every climate except the harsh heat of some deserts. There have been notable sightings of their swarming behavior in the Great Lakes, the swamps of Florida, Lake Ijssel of Netherlands, and multiple lakes and rivers across England. The males are known for their swarming behavior for both physical fitness and reproductive fitness reasons. This swarming causes individuals to arrange themselves more densely in certain hotspots, increasing the population density around these select areas and decreasing the population density elsewhere.  Habitat  = General habitat = C. annularius, like many of its similar family members, gravitate towards habitats that have open bodies of fresh water and an abundance of plant life and decay. The exact specifications of these factors that go into selecting an optimal habitat is still very much unknown. However, research has been able to parse a few correlational factors and conditions. = Environmental conditions = Potamogeton Crispus The species prefer bodies of water with high populations of macrophytes, or plants that grow in or around water. Macrophytes provide the flies with a place to give birth, an adequate supply of food, and shelter. The two most popular macrophyte species that the C. annularius are inclined towards are the Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton lucens. Added on to this, C. annularius stay on the outskirts of freshwater ecosystems in order to avoid areas of open water. By staying near vegetation and away from open water, they are able to decrease their chances of being attacked by predators. Environmental conditions that are still under research are vegetation height and flooding. = Chemical Factors = The pH range of the water can extend between 6.0 and 9.0. This is common for insects but prevents many aquatic vertebrate predators from living in the same water. Added on to this, the fly is resistant to a certain degree to levels of salinity. They have been observed to survive in bodies of water with salinity ranges pushing 2-3 ppt. Lastly, oxygen levels can reach as low as 4% in bodies of water before it becomes a threat. Temperature also has a direct and indirect role on the survivability; Temperature directly increase the development rate of the species in its egg and larval phases, but also indirectly increases levels of food and resources.  Taxonomy  The related species Chironomus antrhacinus The first documented accounts of the Chironomidae family were in the late 19th or early 20th century in England. Entomologists at first had trouble differentiating the difference between subfamilies and genera of the Chironomidae, but had a breakthrough regarding the recognition of difference in their pupal stage. The genus name Chironomus was decided, which was derived from the Ancient Greek word cheironomos, meaning to gesture with your hand. This followed the spirit of the family name Chironomidae, which in Ancient Greek means a pantomimist or one who entertains or dances with exaggerated hand movements. These meanings of names most likely alluded to the swarming behavior and movement of the midges belonging to the Chironomidae family. Lastly, the species name, annularius, is derived from the Latin language, with the meaning 1 year old or annual. This naming is contradictory to the life span of the adult non-biting midges (3 days to a few weeks) but may be related to the seasonable noticeability of the C. annularius, particularly in spring and fall. Due to the broad distribution of the Chironomus genus across the world, it has been given a plethora of nicknames. In North America, they are called chizzywinks or blind mosquitos near Florida, and in the Great Lakes region, they are referred to as bay flies or lake flies.Chizzywinks are Blind Mosquitos by Dan Culbert of the University of Florida, August 17, 2005 Further north in Canada, the Chironomus are called muckle heads or muffle heads.\\"You don't love muffleheads, but Lake Erie does\\", Sandusky Register, May 24, 2010.\\"Muckleheads\\" from Andre's Weather World (Andre Bernier, staff at WJW-TV), June 2, 2007. Across the Atlantic in England, the Chironomus are referred to as non-biting midges or common midges. The diversity of name for such a genus of insects suggest that it exists almost worldwide.  Life Cycle  = Egg = The first stage of development is egg stage. Adult lay eggs directly into the fresh water. This egg will free float or sink to the bottom and hatch in a few days or at most a week. The most defining feature for the fly during this stage is not the egg itself, but rather the gelatinous matrix that accompanies the egg. This matrix expands in the water as it exits the womb and provides a protective layer for the eggs. The eggs are laid out in a helical arrangement in the matrix. The eggs themselves are 1‚Äì3 mm in diameter and an oval shape. They are produced in numbers averaging around 3,000. = Larval = The second stage is the larval instar stage. There are four instar stages, ending with a preparatory pupal phase. During the instar phases, there are a series of great morphological changes or additions with each molting. By the fourth instar stage, the following physical features have developed. The head capsule is a fully sclerotized cranium with very few internal structures excluding a few internal ridges. The mandibles are fully developed on an oblique plane, with a dominant apical tooth, a dorsal tooth, and an additional number of inner teeth. There are a set of eyes or areas of pigment that lie beneath the cuticle and lastly two antennae protruding from the dorsal cranium. The body is segmented into three thoracic sections and nine abdominal sections. Protruding from the thoracic sections are parapods, fleshy false legs that have claws at the end. Less noticeably, there is a set of procerci with a small set of apical hairs. At the end of the fourth instar stage, the fourth instar encases itself in a protective matrix for its pupal phase. = Pupal = The third stage is the pupal stage. This is considered the transitional phase between the fourth instar stage and the adult imago C. annularius. This phase typically lasts between a few days and a week. The first notable development is the exuviae, a protective pupal skin. This can be segmented into the cephalothorax (head and thorax) and the abdomen. The cephalothorax has a thoracic horn, the main respiratory organ, and the leg sheath that cover the legs and fold back beneath the wings. The abdomen contains a distribution of spines, spinules, and tubercles. These have been described as having a Tergal pattern or as an armament of some sort. At the end of the pupal stage, the pupae leave its protective shell and swim upwards to the surface. Upon reaching the top of the water it molts one final time into the adult stage. = Adult = The adult stage is the shortest-lived and lasts only for a week. The Annularius are fully developed and have several distinct features. Their bodies are a dark brown or black color and the wing length ranges from 4 to 6 mm. The mandibles are still oblique but have grown to a much larger size and have a dark black hue. The spinules and spines protrude the most out of the back.  Social Behavior  Examples of Insect Predation (Not C. Annularius) Swarming behavior or \\"aerial aggregations\\" is a common social behavior for the fly species. There are costs and benefits to grouping with other members of your species. Individuals experience decreased rates of predation. This is due to an overall decline by predators on a swarm as well as the dilution of predator attacks per individual. Feeding has also been proven to be more efficient in larger populations. This may be due to group communication and direction to food and resources. Lastly, swarming of males increases the attraction of females, because the sound of the flight tone is amplified when they band together. This may not necessarily increase reproductive success of all individuals, but rather individuals that are able to detect and mate with females first experience the benefit of increased reproductive fitness. Frequency (High vs. Low) The C. annularius species has specific flight tone frequencies. Males have an average frequency of 434 Hz and females have an average frequency of 240 Hz. Different genera of the Chironomus have different frequencies, thus the discernment of tonal frequencies is particularly important in swarming and for mating.  Food Resources  C. annularius, like most Diptera insects, differ in their diet through their life cycle. Larvae have mandibles and varying internal teeth. These larvae feed on fine particulate organic material floating at the bottom of the body of water they were born in. This diet of decaying material continues with a brief intermission during the pupal phase, until adulthood. Once the species emerge from their cocoons and out of the water, their diets change dramatically. The most noticeable change is that the individuals no longer feed on submerged organic particles. They transition to feeding on surface algae, secretions of aphids, and other plant material. Although the species resembles its close relative the mosquito, it is a non- biting midge and does not consume blood.  Human Interaction  = Direct = Multiple different species of the Chironomus genus are considered vectors of pathogens due to their blood sucking behavior. However, the C. annularius species belongs to a subgroup that are referred to as non-biting midges. Their meals are made up entirely of plant detritus and insect secretions. Thus, there is parasitism or infection from the fly on humans or domestic animals. = Indirect = Algae Bloom The indirect effects of C. annularius are still under research. However, its diet has been recognized as particularly influential. The flies eat algae and macrophytes in fresh bodies of water, behavior which can be beneficial when algae blooms or overcrowding of macrophyte beds occur. However, the opposite can be said when they pose a negative impact by clearing all healthy algae from ponds or affecting the health of macrophytes. Most interactions, though, of their observed diet have leaned more towards the former.

It has two general hospitals in Kirkland and Monroe, and several smaller clinics and urgent care facilities in King and Snohomish counties. History =Planning and construction= A public hospital district was formed by a voter-approved ballot measure in 1967 to serve northeastern King County, which had experienced population growth that caused strain on existing medical facilities. After the expansion of the existing Kirkland hospital was found to be impractical due to costs, a site near Totem Lake in northeastern Kirkland was chosen for a new multi-story hospital building. A public contest was held to name the new building, with Evergreen General Hospital announced as the winner in August 1968, defeating 280 other names. In November 1968, voters within the district approved a $4.5 million bond measure to finance construction of the 82-bed hospital. Construction of Evergreen General Hospital began on July 18, 1970, and it was opened to the public on March 9, 1972. The hospital opened with 80 beds, an intensive care unit, two surgery rooms, and specialized departments. The building was designed for future expansion of up to seven floors and 375 beds, as well as auxiliary facilities on the campus. The older, privately run Kirkland Hospital had closed in March 1971 after a decline in the number of patients who instead went to the Overlake Hospital in nearby Bellevue. =Expansions= Following regular overcrowding at the facility in the 1970s, a major expansion to Evergreen General Hospital was constructed in the 1980s. The first expansion added a third floor in 1982 and a fourth in 1984. The hospital also upgraded its trauma center to Level II requirements set by the American College of Surgeons to handle cases previously sent to Overlake, which was competing closely with Evergreen, or Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. A new north wing was opened in 1986, costing $10.2 million to construct, and added a drive-in emergency care center, a larger trauma center, a cafeteria, and an auditorium. The hospital was renamed to Evergreen Hospital Medical Center after the completion of the new wing. A 15-bed hospice opened on the Evergreen campus in February 1991, funded by a $4.4 million bond measure approved by voters in September 1988 that came months after a hospital expansion was rejected. The 1988 hospital expansion's opposition campaign was partially funded by Overlake Hospital's private foundation on the basis of taxpayer obligation. Evergreen instead used reserve funds and bonds to finance a $30 million east wing expansion, consisting of a 36-room maternity center, four surgical suites, outpatient service centers, a parking garage, and administrative offices in a five-story building that opened in November 1992. The east wing housed the first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine on the West Coast, which was installed in January 1993. Evergreen joined a regional healthcare alliance led by Swedish Medical Center in 1993 and changed its name to Evergreen Community Health Care two years later. The hospital was certified as the first \\"Baby-Friendly Hospital\\" in the United States by UNICEF in 1996 and was recognized for prioritizing breast-feeding for newborns. The organization was renamed in 1996 to Evergreen Healthcare Medical Group and began opening primary care facilities around the Eastside in the 2000s. The Kirkland hospital expanded further in 2002 with a five-story, 78-bed Surgery and Physicians Center and filed plans for a new tower on the campus. A $120 million bond measure was approved by voters in May 2004 to construct a ten- story tower for overnight stays and surgical facilities. The new tower opened in May 2007 and expanded the emergency department to 42 beds. The system's name was shortened to EvergreenHealth in 2012. EvergreenHealth entered into a partnership with Valley General Hospital in Monroe in 2014, renaming it EvergreenHealth Monroe the following year. =2020 coronavirus pandemic= The first eight identified U.S. fatalities from the 2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 were reported at EvergreenHealth Kirkland, beginning with the first on February 29, 2020. The cases were residents or visitors to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a local nursing home. The hospital increased its number of beds in negative-airflow rooms from 15 to 58 as part of its response to the growing number of coronavirus patients; , 65 people treated at the hospital have tested positive for the coronavirus and 15 have died. EvergreenHealth was criticized by its Kirkland employees for not communicating the level of risk posed to them and informing them of infection exposure. By late March, the number of reported cases at the hospital had slowed to less than four per day and the intensive care unit was half-full. Facilities =Kirkland= EvergreenHealth Kirkland is a 318-bed general hospital in Kirkland, Washington, located near Interstate 405 and the Totem Lake Mall. It opened in 1972 and is the flagship of the EvergreenHealth system, with several specialty buildings on the same campus. The Kirkland campus includes connections to Interstate 405 and local transit operated by King County Metro, serving a transit center that opened in 2008. =Monroe= Front entrance of EvergreenHealth Monroe Medical Center EvergreenHealth Monroe is a 112-bed general hospital in Monroe, Washington, a suburban city in eastern Snohomish County. It was founded in 1949 as the Valley General Hospital and was operated by a public hospital district from 1960 to 2014. The hospital also had a separate clinic operated by Group Health from 1996 to 2003. =Clinics= EvergreenHealth operates primary care centers and clinics in Canyon Park, Duvall, Kenmore, Kirkland, Mill Creek, Monroe, Redmond, Sammamish, Sultan, and Woodinville. Organization EvergreenHealth has 4,500 employees, including 1,100 physicians and 500 volunteers. It is officially the King County Public Hospital District No. 2 and managed by an elected board of commissioners from within the hospital district, which encompasses most of the northern Eastside. The board of commissioners was increased from five seats to seven in 2016. The Monroe facility is managed by an Alliance Governance Board with representatives from EvergreenHealth and the Snohomish County Public Hospital District No. 1, which has five elected commissioners. In 2018, EvergreenHealth had total revenue of $1.9 billion, primarily from Medicare and private insurers, and total expenses of $702.8 million. The King County facilities served 340,146 outpatient visits, while the Snohomish County facilities served 16,257 visits. EvergreenHealth is part of Eastside Health Alliance, which also includes Overlake Hospital Medical Center, and has partnerships with the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.

Critics who have studied Fraser‚Äôs performances claim that he uses classic cold reading techniques to convince his audience that he possesses paranormal powers.  Career  Prior to becoming a professional psychic, Fraser trained as a paramedic and physician assistant. He has said that, when working as an Emergency Medical Technician, he realized he had an ability to help people emotionally, and that he once did psychic readings while working at an East Providence, Rhode Island beauty salon. Fraser says that taking on the job of a psychic \\"was a calling from God\\", and also that he \\"inherited his gift to hear 'messages from heaven' from his grandmother and his mother.\\" According to the South Florida Gay News, Fraser claims his first contact with the dead was with the spirit of his grandmother. He has also said that his native American heritage is important to his \\"psychic abilities\\". The Southington Observer reported that when on stage, \\"Fraser is a charming young man. He is funny when there is a need to calm the nerves of those he says the spirits urge him to address. He is serious when the messages he must convey are serious. He expresses compassion when the grief of his subject is too overwhelming. Setting aside his psychic abilities, Fraser appears to be a shrewd judge of human nature. He is able to cajole people to express emotions that may have been bottled up for too long.\\" In 2012, Fraser published a book, The Secrets to Unlocking Your Psychic Ability, and currently has more psychic books planned, including one for children. His second book, When Heaven Calls, is due to be released in 2020. Along with his girlfriend Alexa Papigiotis, Fraser will be the central character in a planned reality TV sitcom called Meet the Frasers, due for release on E! Entertainment in 2020. Fraser claims that he has worked with local police and private investigators on cold cases, in which he helped families locate their missing children, but skeptic Susan Gerbic has argued that if he really was able to perform such tasks the demand for his services would be much higher. Fraser and Papigiotis live in Cranston, Rhode Island. Fraser's mother, who also claims to be a psychic, is his office manager. It has been estimated that Fraser grossed around $20,000 for one live appearance. =Meet the Frasers= Fraser stars in a reality TV show, Meet the Frasers, on E! beginning in January 2020. The series focuses on Fraser and his family, including his fiance Alexa Papigiotis, his mother and his sister Maria Fraser, who said in a promo that \\"I don't believe in psychics... But, I support my brother and I respect what he does, 'cause he's making money.\\" A second season was planned, but has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Critical analysis = Live shows = Fraser addressing a row in his audience, January 2018 Critics and the media have attended Fraser's live shows, and reported on the cold reading techniques being used: *Paranormal investigator Kenny Biddle wrote: \\"I watched Fraser ask entire rows of people to stand up at a time then commence throwing out general statements (e.g., I'm seeing a father figure that passed) and waiting for someone in the row to claim it was their relative ... he was actually giving himself a one in twelve chance that someone will be hooked.\\" Biddle also noted that Fraser may playfully scold an audience member if they were not forthcoming with the psychic connection required to continue his routine. * Skeptic Susan Gerbic wrote: \\"The wordplay used by a medium who is cold reading is only something you can understand if you slow it down and replay it. The statements made are usually so general that they would fit most people of a given generation. But the performer adds enough dialog to make it sound really personal and specific to the sitter.\\" *The New York Times reported: \\"Fraser was a brilliant performer... It was a classic cold reading, all generalized notions searching for something slightly more specific to move [on] to.\\" *Mentalist Mark Edward observed that: \\"[Fraser] goes to one end and stands just slightly in front of the row, leaning forward so he can see all their faces and body language. He states a standard fishing line such as he's 'getting an impression' of something... he brings up into view his pointing index finger and begins the process of generally pointing it at the row... scanning for a reaction.\\" =Shannon Miller reading= In March 2018, Fraser gave a reading to on-air personality Shannon Miller on WVIT in Connecticut. In 2019, Susan Gerbic reported on this reading for Skeptical Inquirer and summarized it as using both cold reading and hot reading techniques, including postulating that Fraser acquired information from Miller's Instagram account. Gerbic summarized: = Operation Peach Pit = Fraser at the Valley Forge Casino Resort, January 2018 The New York Times reporter Jack Hitt was embedded with a team of skeptics to observe what was called \\"Operation Peach Pit\\", a sting following a procedure similar to one previously used against Thomas John. In this case, the target was Fraser. According to Hitt, Fraser \\"resembles Tom Cruise in the role of an oversharing altar boy. He has been on the circuit for years, has a book under his belt and works some Doubletree or Crowne Plaza back room every two or three days\\". In January 2018, paranormal investigator Kenny Biddle and a group of five friends, using aliases matching the faked Facebook accounts, attended Fraser's show at the Valley Forge Casino in King of Prussia. As Biddle reported in Skeptical Inquirer: Biddle also reported, \\"I went into this experience... willing to see if there was anything truthful to the claims made by Matt Fraser... [but] he didn't seem to demonstrate any supernatural ability, just a knack for fast-talking his customers into believing he could talk to spirits.\\" The New York Times reported on this sting in the same article in which it reported on the successful Thomas John sting.

Masaryk sluice) is a lock on the Elbe river in √öst√≠ nad Labem, Czech republic, located immediately below the St≈ôekov Castle. The waterworks were built between 1923 and 1935 according to plans of architect Franti≈°ek Vahala. Their main purpose was to navigate the Elbe in the area of the St≈ôekov rapids, which were often impassable. In its time it was one of the largest waterworks in the country and one with the most modern technical concept in Europe. The hydroelectric power plant, which is part of the sluice, was put into operation in 1935. the waterworks is build in the functionalism style. The Elbe road is one of the most important waterways in the Czech Republic. Two and a half thousand ships got through this lock in 2010. The sluice was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958. Sluice  Description  Part of the waterworks are two locks, a hydroelectric station with three vertically installed Kaplan turbines. Within the facility, a differential of 10 meters in the water levels can be achieved. Part of the barrage is a fish pass. A vast bulk of the original sluice equipment has remained fully operational up to date even though their expected useful life was estimated for 20 years. = Weir = The weir is 111 m long, it is divided by three pillars into four fields, each 24 meters wide. The pillars are 5 m wide and lined with granite blocks at the bottom. The weir elevates the river to a distance of 19.8 km, the maximum height difference between the upper and lower level is 9.75 m. = Fish pass = In the pillar that separates the weir and the power plant, a chamber-type fish crossing was established in 2002 replacing the original, defunct, one. To accommodate the large difference in water levels, its length is 253 m. It is equipped with three adjustable cross walls and with an observation point for the migration control. However, years of experience have shown that only some medium-sized fish migrate through it. In 2017 a study was published on \\"Promoting migration of salmon at waterworks St≈ôekov\\" with suggestions on how to rebuilt the sluice so it can accommodate passage of larger fish such as salmon. Lock = Chambers = There are two lock chambers, a small one measuring 2 √ó 82.5 m √ó 13 m and a large one measuring 170 m √ó 24 m. = Hydroelectric power plant = Three vertical Kaplan turbines with a total output of 19.5 MW are installed in the hydroelectric power plant. This power plant engaged at all times - not only at peak energy levels, as is the prevailing custom elsewhere. Due to the unfinished river bank roads, the operating regulations allow for backwater up to 141.8 meters above the sea level. For the same reason the gradient has been reduced to 7 meters and the output to 3 √ó 5 MW. With a total output of 15 MW, it is the largest flow- through power plant in the Elbe basin. The average annual production is 80- 100 mil. kWh.  Reservoir  The St≈ôekov reservoir creates a 19.8 km long lake with a total volume of 16.1 million m¬≥. In addition to ensuring navigability, it reduces the flooding risk in the Lovosice - Z√°lezly section. It also allows surface water abstraction for farming purposes.  Recognition  The sluice was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958. In 2009 the Czech National bank issued a 2500 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Industrial Heritage Sites series. The coin was designed by Josef Opli≈°til.

History Motte of ch√¢teau de Gu√Ænes. Baldwin II, Count of Gu√Ænes, began construction of a castle at Gu√Ænes on top of an ancient fort in the late 12th century, consisting of a courtyard, surrounded by towers with a donjon. After the capture of Calais by King Edward III of England in 1349, the castle was captured by the English in 1352 by an English force led by the valet John of Doncaster. In 1360, the Treaty of Br√©tigny surrendered the city and its county to England becoming part of the Pale of Calais. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy laid siege to Gu√Ænes in 1436 with a force of Flemish militia. When an English relief army of some 10,000 men under Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester approached, the Duke of Burgundy abandoned the siege, leaving his artillery and large amounts of baggage behind. Francis d'Orl√©ans, Count of Angoul√™me laid siege to Gu√Ænes in 1514, but broke the siege upon learning of the approach of an English army under the command of King Henry VIII of England. The castle was placed under siege by a French army in 1558, led by Francis, Duke of Guise. The castle withstood the siege for a few days. The English commander, William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton, was forced to surrender the castle after the French entered the outer defences of the castle, Grey was wounded and his soldiers refused to fight on. The French gave honourable terms of surrender and English rule of the area came to an end. The castle was badly slighted by the Duke of Guise, however was known to be used to house the local commander. It was later destroyed during the Spanish incursions during 1595 to 1598.

The design is intended to be built in commercial shipyards at a considerable cost saving over dedicated naval shipyards, taking as little as 2 years to build. The multirole ship has positions for role-specific ISO containers that can be swapped to change roles. The design has one helicopter spot at the back, for up to medium weight aircraft. There is no hangar. A fully enclosed boat deck at roughly the middle of the ship's length opens at both sides to allow gantry cranes to deploy both sides to lower boats to the water. Additionally, a smaller seaboat is sited on the port side. The two propellers are above the keel. Two bow thrusters are sited just behind the bulbous bow. With likely limited speed requirements, the fuel consumption is likely to be low.  Armament  Depictions of the ship show a single mount for a small calibre gun on the foredeck.  Crew  Crew numbers could be as few as 16-20 in some role configurations.  Royal Norwegian Navy  Following the collision and sinking of the Royal Norwegian Navy ship HNoMS Helge Ingstad (F313) in November 2018, the repair cost has been estimated at 13 billion Kroner (USD$1.4 billion), nearly three times the cost of the original build, there has been speculation that the Navy would instead invest in another class of ships.

It merged in 1999 with Oberaargau Regional Transport (Regionalverkehr Oberaargau; RVO), the Biel-T√§uffelen-Ins Railway (Biel- T√§uffelen-Ins-Bahn, BTI) and the Oberaargauische Automobilkurse (OAK) to form Aare Seeland mobil (ASm), which now operates the 14.5 km-long, metre-gauge line from Solothurn to Niederbipp. The railway is locally called the Bipperlisi. This term has long outgrown the vernacular and finds itself used in the official communications of the canton of Solothurn.  History = Start of operations= The Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway, which was based in Solothurn, opened its metre-gauge line from Niederbipp in the canton of Bern to Baseltor station in the capital of the canton of Solothurn on 9 January 1918. There was a connection in Niederbipp to the also metre-gauge Langenthal- Jura Railway (Langenthal-Jura-Bahn; LJB), which had opened on the Langenthal‚ÄìNiederbipp‚ÄìOensingen Schulhaus route in 1907. It soon sought cooperation with the LJB and the Langenthal-Melchnau Railway (Langenthal- Melchnau-Bahn; LMB), which had opened in 1917. It used the 1200 Volt DC electrification system, already used by the LJB. The SNB line ended north of the Aare in Solothurn at the Baseltor (Basel Gate) on the edge of the old town, while the station of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) is south of the Aare. The commercially-important proximity to the SBB station was achieved with the construction of the R√∂ti bridge over the Aare and the opening of the tramway-like Solothurn Baseltor‚ÄìSolothurn (SBB) section running over it on 7 September 1925. Since then, the terminus of the SNB has been located in the station forecourt (Bahnhofplatz) on the north side of the SBB station. The SNB was hardly affected by significant changes in the following years, while changes at the neighbouring LJB and LMB railways only marginally affected it. After 1928, the LJB had closed a section in Oensingen, followed by the entire Niederbipp‚ÄìOensingen section on 9 May 1943. This made Niederbipp a terminal station for the metre-gauge railways. = Mergers= On 1 January 1958, the LJB and the LMB merged with the Oberaargau-Jura Railways (Oberaargau-Jura- Bahnen; OJB), with which the SNB concluded a new cooperation agreement in 1959. As a result of the cooperation, the SNB was able to do without its own workshop; rolling stock maintenance has since been carried out by the OJB workshop in Langenthal. In order to transport standard-gauge freight wagons of the SBB on the metre-gauge line, a transporter wagon yard was opened in Niederbipp, allowing the delivery points as far as Riedholz to be served. The yard was also shared by the LJB, which had used the same system in Langenthal since 1909. This extremely complex system for the transport of large volumes was largely replaced on the SNB by the commissioning of a dual gauge section between Niederbipp and the Oberbipp (tank farm) siding on 7 March 1970. An early sign of the later merger was a formal agreement that was contracted on 5 April 1984 between the BTI, the OJB, the SNB, the Oberaargauischen Automobilkurse (a bus company; OAK), the Ligerz-Tessenberg-Bahn (a funicular railway; LTB) and the Bielersee-Schiffahrts-Gesellschaft (Lake Biel Ferry Company; BSG) to form Oberaargau-Solothurn-Seeland-Transport (OSST). Before the merger, the OJB changed its name to Regionalverkehr Oberaargau (\\"Oberaargau Regional Transport\\"; RVO) on 2 July 1990. The OSST partners BTI, RVO, SNB and OAK finally completed the merger into Aare Seeland mobil (ASm) in 1999. The LTB was also merged into the ASm in 2003, while the BSG has remained legally independent until today.  Line after the 1999 merger The current ASm line has now been extended from Niederbipp to Oensingen again. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 1 December 2010, while operations on the new 1.7 kilometre-long section commenced at the timetable change on 9 December 2012. This line generally uses the route used by the LJB from 1907 to 1943‚Äîbut built as a tramway‚Äîand which was occasionally shared by the SNB even then.

Under the OSST, a uniform numbering scheme was introduced for all railway companies involved, the SNB vehicles were given 300 numbers while the (identical) OJB vehicles were given 100 numbers. The orange-coloured vehicles, sometimes referred to as Sch√ºttelbecher (\\"shaker cups\\"), were stored, sold or scrapped. ;Renovation With the decision to modernise the former SNB line, the rolling stock has been renewed. The ASm called tenders for three new low-floor multiple units for the whole Solothurn‚ÄìNiederbipp‚ÄìLangenthal line in April 2005. The tender was awarded to Stadler Rail in accordance with the metre- gauge FLIRT concept. The EMU has a similar modular structure as the new metre- gauge sets built for the Forch Railway and the St. Gallen‚ÄìTrogen railway. The new program was called Star (for: Schmalspur-Triebzug f√ºr attraktiven Regionalverkehr‚Äî\\"narrow-gauge multiple unit for attractive regional transport\\"). The three trains ordered since the summer of 2008‚Äîpainted dark red‚Äîare in use by the ASm. With three more trains, which were delivered in 2011, the old Solothurn-Niederbipp fleet was completely replaced.

Starring Sunny Singh, Maanvi Gagroo, Saurabh Shukla, Karishma Sharma and Aishwarya Sakhuja, it is co- produced by Aaradhya Maheshwari. It is an official remake of the 2017 Kannada movie Ondu Motteya Kathe. It was theatrically released in India on 1 November 2019. The film is about a balding 30-year-old bachelor who is in search of a wife and is given a deadline to find one or remain celibate forever. Plot A 30 year balding Hindi lecturer, Chaman Kohli searches desperately for a suitable girl to marry after his family astrologer warns him that if he doesn't get married before his 31st birthday, then he'll have to spend his whole life in celibacy. He confides in his friend who also happens to be the clerk of the college. He advises him to go and search for a bridesmaid at a wedding as that‚Äôs where many relationships are formed. Chaman tries to woo a girl at his friend‚Äôs wedding but later discovers her making out with his brother Goldie. He tries to ask his colleague out on the clerk‚Äôs advice but they also deny saying they‚Äôve got their respective boyfriends. Chaman tries to solve the problem by using a wig, but when his bluff is exposed, he leaves in disgust. A first year student, Aaina, comes to him and consoles him for his mockery by other students. She befriends him and hangs out with him only to get hold of the exam questions. Goldie sees Aaina and Chaman together and tells the family about them making them very happy. She later becomes very indifferent towards him and refuses to even talk. Chaman finds solace on Tinder and meets Apsara, a make up artist but oversized girl. Both of them instantly dislike each other because of their looks and the edited pictures they uploaded but agree on being friends as an excuse to leave the date. Later Chaman offers to drop Apsara and both end up having an accident. In hospital their families bond well and assume them a couple. They set their Roka ceremony much to Chaman‚Äôs chagrin, but Apsara starts falling for him. She posts their picture on Facebook which becomes a laughing stock for students who post hate comments, making Chaman really upset. He asks Apsara to delete it when she tries hard to explain to him that people will say some or the other thing but he shouldn‚Äôt react on everything and accept himself the way he is. On their engagement, Chaman texts Apsara that he is not happy with this union and she takes the blame on herself calling off the ceremony. Chaman sulks in private and the clerk notices this and takes him to dinner at his place. He introduces him to his wife who is mute and yet how happy they are as a couple. Later Chaman starts dating a colleague who earlier rejected him. She asks him to meet his parents by wearing his wig. This gives Chaman an epiphany of how honest and pure Apsara was, as she accepted him for his inner beauty and not his debonair looks. He goes and apologises to her and they are seen living happily together.

History The base was located approximately 33km northeast of L·ªôc Ninh and 28km northwest of S√¥ng B√© Base Camp and approximately 5km from the Cambodian border. The base camp was established by the 5th Special Forces Group Detachment A-341 in November 1963. On the night of 20/1 July 1965 two Viet Cong battalions attacked the camp. At daybreak 3 CIDG companies arrived from Camp B√π Gia M·∫≠p securing the camp. VC losses were 161 killed. From January through March 1967, repeated contact with the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces was made in the vicinity of the camp. On 14 January a CIDG company from the camp, accompanied by 2 U.S. Special Forces soldiers and 2 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces soldiers, departed the camp with the mission of conducting a search and destroy operation with reconnaissance in Bu Dop's tactical area of responsibility. The patrol left at 04:00. The terrain consisted of rubber trees, thick undergrowth, bamboo thickets, and savannah grass. The path of the patrol ran through an area where a reconnaissance patrol from B√π ƒê·ªëp had encountered the enemy on 8 December 1966. As the patrol drew closer to that area, the men heard shots and the company immediately broke into three files and started to search the area. At 11:55, the point squad received fire and suffered one killed and one wounded. Firing broke out all around the company, and the advisers made radio contact with a Forward air controller who requested air strikes. The company was receiving heavy fire from the right flank, and 7 more soldiers were wounded and 2 killed. The advisers recommended an assault from the right flank to prevent encirclement. The company was still in its initial assault and a momentary lull enabled the men to follow this lactic. The CIDG company attacked and overran the PAVN positions, and the disorganised PAVN withdrew in disarray. At 12:20 an air strike was made on the retreating PAVN. The troops continued the assault, finding the bodies of 25 PAVN soldiers in the positions. By this time, the company had suffered 3 killed and eleven wounded. Under cover of air strikes, the company withdrew to the west to locate a landing zone for medical evacuation. While waiting for the helicopters the men collected and assembled all equipment and documents captured. The company was still receiving small arms fire from the east and additional air strikes were made in that direction. The landing zone was secured and medical evacuation was completed by 15:00. At 17:30 an additional company landed and immediately started searching the area. The first company was extracted at 17:30 and returned to the camp. While searching the area, the new company found an additional 16 PAVN bodies. 25 maps and schematic drawings that were also found indicated that plans were being made to attack the camp and the Bo Duc Subsector. At 19:15 the relief force withdrew to the camp, arriving there at 22:45. Within two hours after the first contact was made in this operation, the MIKE Force at Nha Trang had been airlifted to B√π ƒê·ªëp to defend the camp. At 07:15 on 17 February 1967, the 1st Company of the Third Nung Battalion (Airborne), III Corps' MIKE Force, arrived at B√π ƒê·ªëp to reinforce the camp and conduct offensive operations to the east of camp. On 20 February, this company made contact with more than a battalion from the PAVN 12th Regiment, which was armed wth 57mm recoilless rifles, 82mm mortars and the standard small arms. The PAVN directed an extremely heavy volume of fire into the advancing troops, but the Nungs outmaneuvered the PAVN and gained fire superiority. Fighting continued until tactical aircraft attacked. The PAVN broke off the fighting and headed for the Cambodian border. Withdrawing south to a landing zone where medical evacuation was accomplished and reinforcements were brought in, the company then moved west back into an area protected by B√π ƒê·ªëp's artillery unit to rest for the night. The result of this action was 40 PAVN killed, 1 Special Forces soldier killed, 1 CIDG soldier killed and 7 CIDG soldiers wounded. On 23 March 1967, two CIDG companies from the camp engaged a reinforced PAVN company approximately 10km east of camp. 20 PAVN were killed in this action along with another estimated 40 killed by air strikes. On 24 March, a CIDG company and a MIKE Force company conducted a heliborne assault on the same area and shortly thereafter became heavily engaged with 2 PAVN battalions, equipped with automatic weapons and recoilless rifles and supported by mortars. Casualties were 3 CIDG killed and 11 wounded and 2 Special Forces men and 11 MIKE Force soldiers missing. It was confirmed that 98 PAVN were killed, with a further 170 estimated killed by air strikes. Shortly after midnight on 29 November 1967 the VC 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 272nd Regiment attacked the Bo Duc District headquarters, a fortified compound defended by a reconnaissance company from the ARVN 5th Division, a company of Regional Forces soldiers, and two Popular Forces platoons. VC mortar fire prevented the CIDG at B√π ƒê·ªëp Camp from reinforcing the embattled district headquarters. On the afternoon of 29 November the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, as well as Battery A, 2nd Battalion, 33rd Artillery, equipped with 105mm howitzers, flew in from Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i Base Camp to B√π ƒê·ªëp and established a firebase at the northwestern end of the runway. Shortly after 22:00, a salvo of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets plunged into the firebase. One rocket landed squarely on a bunker, killing all 4 of its occupants. When the bombardment ended, hundreds of VC soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 271st Regiment, and elements of the 80A Replacement and Training Regiment emerged from rubber trees on the eastern side of the runway. As they crossed the open ground that separated the woods from the firebase, a distance of some 200 meters, the American artillery crews depressed their howitzer barrels and fired directly into the onrushing infantry. Small arms and machine gun fire from the 1/28th Infantry, brought down more VC troops, but they still pressed the assault. Minutes later a pair of helicopter gunships arrived overhead. A dozen or more VC antiaircraft machine guns greeted the aircraft, but their pilots evaded the fire and spotted a cluster of mortars firing from a soccer field in a nearby hamlet. Several strafing runs disabled the weapons and decimated their operators. A flight of F‚Äì100 fighter-bombers attacked the VC- held woods with bombs and cannon fire. The VC assault faltered and soon they were retreating back into the forest. By 00:30 almost all of the shooting had stopped. U.S. casualties were 7 killed and 11 wounded, the VC left behind 31 bodies. VC prisoners later reported that the rest of the 271st and the entire 272nd Regiment had been lurking nearby during the engagement to exploit any breakthrough that occurred. During the next week, Allied patrols continued to clash with VC forces around Bo Duc, and each night mortar shells landed in the town. Believing that a second and larger attack against the district capital might still be in the offing, the 2/28th Infantry and a 4.2-inch mortar platoon were sent to fortify a second firebase at the B√π ƒê·ªëp airstrip on 4 December. Two days later the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and Battery B, 1st Battalion, 5th Artillery, to establish a firebase southeast of Bo Duc where VC activity had been spotted. At 01:00 on 8 December, the 3rd Battalion, 273rd Regiment, attacked the firebase of the 1/2nd Infantry, with the main assault party advancing behind a steady barrage of Rocket-propelled grenades. U.S. artillery, using the minimum amount of propellant possible because the engagement range was so short, tore through the VC ranks with high-explosive shells and prevented him from reaching the outer wire. After taking further losses from air strikes, helicopter gunships and 4.2-inch mortars, the VC withdrew around 03:00. The Americans counted 49 VC dead the next day against their own loss of 4 killed. The base was later transferred to the ARVN 97th Border Ranger Battalion on 31 December 1970. Current use The base has been turned over to farmland.

But as with all great pop culture discussion, Shameless taps into bigger themes that hide beneath and how a zeitgeist can change the way we think.\\" Shameless launched on March 12, 2018, with weekly Monday episodes. Later that year, Andrews and McDonald launched Thursday 'In Conversation' episodes, in which they interview a well-known person.https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/shameless/id1352875216 History Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald first worked together as colleagues at women's media company Mamamia, where they pitched the podcast concept for Shameless. Upon its rejection, the pair began working on Shameless independently, and left their roles at Mamamia to pursue the podcast free of network support. They began recording the podcast from home, sticking 'Shameless Podcast' posters inside girls' bathrooms at universities, and engaging with listeners on social media. Since then, Shameless has become the first of many Shameless Media podcasts. It has been downloaded over four million times as of August 2019, and has been written about in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Age, Marie Claire, and The Sydney Morning Herald. In 2018, Shameless was listed as Apple's 'Best of 2018' podcasts, and in 2019, was recognised as Australia's Most Popular Podcast at the Australian Podcast Awards. Shameless has also sold out live shows across Australia. Michelle and Zara's first book \\"The Space Between\\" was released on the 1st of September 2020.

It happened with a normative act of the Kingdom of Sardinia - the law 17 March 1861, n. 4761 - with which Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy assumed for himself and for his successors the title of King of Italy.Regno di Sardegna, Regno d'Italia, Repubblica Italiana March 17 is commemorated annually by the Anniversary of the Unification of Italy, a national holiday established in 1911 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary, and also celebrated, in the Republican era, in 1961 and 2011. History Carlo Bossoli: the royal procession at the opening of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy Following the Second Italian War of Independence and the Expedition of the Thousand, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, in the two-year period 1859-60, the goal of the unification of Italy had been largely achieved, with the sole exception of the Triveneto and Lazio. The annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia of the various provinces had been sanctioned by a series of plebiscites. However, the new state still carried the name of Kingdom of Sardinia. On February 18, 1861, the new Parliament, already known as the Italian Parliament, met in Turin, at Palazzo Carignano, formerly the seat of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia, even though it was numbered as VIII, thus continuing the numbering of the legislatures of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy also included parliamentarians elected in the \\"new provinces\\", while the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy, not elected but appointed by the king, had been integrated with appointments of senators from different parts of Italy. The opening of the new legislature took place with the speech of the Crown pronounced by the King. The Senate in the reply voted on February 26 spoke explicitly of a new realm. The Chamber of Deputies in the response speech to Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, written by Giuseppe Ferrari and dated 13 March 1861, already declared that: King Vittorio Emanuele II assumes the title of King of Italy with the law n. 4671 of 17 March 1861 of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Immediately after the start of the legislature, on 21 February, the then Prime Minister Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour presented to the Senate a bill, consisting of a single article, to formalize the new name of the King.Carlo Belviglieri Storia d'Italia dal 1814 al 1866 vol 5 e 6 p.289 This became law on March 17, 1861, with the publication in the Official Journal of the Kingdom of Italy n.67. March 17 is commemorated annually by the Anniversary of the Unification of Italy, a national holiday established in 1911 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary. The law The royal decree read: In the Report Cavour recalled that However, in the text approved by the Senate a second article also appears on the question of the heading of legislative acts. It was therefore established that: The numeral of Victor Emmanuel of Savoy continued to be \\"second\\", not \\"first\\", as a sign of the continuity of the House of Savoy dynasty which had achieved Italian unificationAlfredo Oriani, La lotta politica in Italia 1892 in Tommaso Detti, Giovanni Gozzini, Ottocento, Pearson Paravia Bruno Mondadadori, 2000, p.184 and of the continuity of the Statuto Albertino.

In July of the same year he published a controversial interview with the historian David Starkey, during which Starkey made controversial statements that resulted in his getting fired; the interview led to Grimes being the subject of a police investigation on the suspicion of stirring up racial hatred. Early life Grimes grew up in a single-parent household in Consett, County Durham, England. He is openly gay. He studied fashion and business studies at the University of Brighton. Activism While at university, Grimes was an activist for the Liberal Democrats, and worked for then-MP Norman Lamb's unsuccessful 2015 party leadership campaign. The following year he founded the pro-Brexit group BeLeave aimed at younger voters during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum campaign. Grimes later dropped out of university, and between 2016 and 2018, he worked as a deputy editor for the political website BrexitCentral, founded by Matthew Elliott, the former Vote Leave chief executive. In 2018, he became the digital manager for the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a free market think tank. In 2019, together with commentators Steven Edginton, Chloe Westley, Dominique Samuels, Tom Harwood and others, he was amongst those associated with a newly launched right-wing youth organisation called Turning Point UK (TPUK). The organisation was set-up by Tory-party donor and unsuccessful MEP candidate for the Brexit Party George Farmer, but the organisation refused to disclose its other donors. The project was endorsed by ‚Äì among others ‚Äì Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage. It is closely allied to Turning Point USA, a pro- Trump youth movement. TPUK caused controversy when it encouraged students to video any \\"perceived left-wing bias\\" of university lecturers. In May 2020, he launched ReasonedUK, a platform for those \\"standing against the tide\\" who \\"hide [their] political views for fear of being called homophobic, a TERF, [or] racist\\". Some criticised perceived transphobia voiced by Grimes during the launch. The satire magazine Private Eye revealed that the platform ReasonedUK is produced by the son of former Brexit Party MEP Lance Forman. A video has also been released by Grimes on ReasonedUK that appears to be a near word-for-word copy of a video released by the US right-wing platform PragerU. In July 2020, an interview with the historian David Starkey that Grimes published on his video platform sparked controversy. The historian remarked that \\"Slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn't be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain, would there?\\" This prompted criticism, including condemnation by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid. Starkey's subsequent resignation from his fellowship at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge was accepted by the university on 3 July 2020 He was also dismissed by Canterbury Christ Church University, and was dropped by current and former publishers. Grimes was investigated by police on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred and was asked to come to the police station to be interviewed under caution. Grimes responded in a statement saying \\"I cannot imagine a more contemptible way for the Metropolitan Police to abuse taxpayers' money and the trust of citizens than by investigating this vexatious claim.\\" The former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald called the investigation \\"deeply threatening of free speech\\", a view which was echoed by Conservative party MPs. Electoral Commission case In 2018, Grimes was fined ¬£20,000 by the Electoral Commission after it determined that there was evidence that BeLeave had spent more than ¬£675,000 with the Canadian political consultancy firm AggregateIQ in coordination with the official Brexit campaign organisation Vote Leave in distribution targeted social media advertisements. The Commission argued that these actions violated electoral spending rules, and that Grimes and Vote Leave official David Alan Halsall had made false declarations relating to the spending. Vote Leave's fine was upheld on appeal, but Grimes' was overturned. Subsequently, in May 2020, the Metropolitan Police ended its investigation into Grimes and Halsall.

She is initially shy to player- character and cousin Yu Narukami, but eventually grows more comfortable. She struggles through the game with loneliness, the loss of her mother, and concern over her father Ryotaro Dojima, who is often absent due to his job as a detective. She appears as a playable character in Persona 4: Dancing All Night, where designers made a point to try to avoid her dancing style seem too adult. She has been well-received and is regarded as one of the best characters in Persona 4. Multiple critics held her as an example of a quality child character in video games. Concept and creation Nanako Dojima was created for Persona 4. She is the young cousin of Yu Narukami, and Ryotaro Dojima's only daughter. Nanako is a guileless girl, and is usually left at home due to her father's work. Nanako is capable of taking care of herself. She is voiced by Akemi Kanda in Japanese and Karen Strassman in English. When designing Nanako as a playable character for Persona 4: Dancing All Night, designer Kanami Mashita desired to avoid potentially making her too flamboyant or provocative in how she dances, as he found these \\"completely out of character.\\" The design staff employed an adult idol do the motion capture rather than a child dancer, which created problems as it took time and effort to avoid giving Nanako \\"allure\\" from the idol's dancing. Appearances Nanako appears in Persona 4. She starts off initially shy to Yu, but eventually regards him as a brother. She expresses anxiety over her mother's death and how much her father Ryotaro, a detective investigating the murders central to Persona 4s plot, works to Yu, worrying it means he does not love her. Yu helps Nanako come to terms with her father's busy professional life, and Nanako realizes he misses her mother as much as she does. Over the course of the game, Nanako finds herself befriending Yu's friends. Late in the story, Nanako is kidnapped by Taro Namatame and placed into the TV world. During the investigation of Namatame, Nanako passes away for reasons unknown to the doctor; Yu is then forced to choose between exacting revenge on Namatame or sparing him. If Namatame is killed, Nanako's death is set and the game will end. If the protagonist chooses not to take revenge and save his life, Nanako will be miraculously resuscitated, claiming she heard the player characters' voices. Reception Nanako has received generally positive reception. She ranked highly among the cast of Persona 4 in a fan poll. Another poll at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show had her being considered the best female character in the game. Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer found her one of the best characters in the Persona series, praising her for her sweet disposition and the emotion she felt when she calls Yu \\"big bro.\\" She also calls her one of the best child characters in gaming. Nanako's temporary death was regarded as the most memorable scene of Persona 4 by Susan Arendt of GamesRadar+, who also called it \\"heartbreaking.\\" Lucas M. Thomas of IGN included her kidnapping and temporary death as one of the most unforgettable moments in video games. He found the bond between her and the player to be the strongest in the game. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid felt that the most touching moment in Persona 4, noting that it made him cry. He also considered the \\"familial love\\" of a big brother to a little sister as one of the best shows of love in gaming. Jason Schreier of Kotaku found Nanako and her habit of singing the Junes jingle as qualities that made Persona 4 special. Her role in Persona 4: Dancing All Night was met with praise. Donald Theriault of Nintendo World Report felt she was a rare example of a good child character and that her dancing in the game made his \\"heart melt.\\" Alissa McAloon similarly enjoyed her role in this game, calling her \\"adorable.\\" Nate Ewert-Krocker of Paste Magazine found Nanako's dancing to be \\"genuine,\\" and noted that it helped clear the \\"violent, misanthropic gunk\\" away from video games for a moment.

Ian Bailey was accused of murdering a French citizen in Ireland. The French judicial authorities requested the extradition of Bailey from Ireland to France so to question him about the crime. However, the issue in this case was that Bailey is not a French citizen, rather his nationality is British. This case dealt with an unprecedented question of law as usually the person requested by the issuing state is a national of that state. The significance of this case was that the Supreme Court dealt with a situation where Bailey was a British national yet the French authorities requested for his extradition. Nevertheless, the Court decided that Bailey could not be surrendered because the French had not actually charged him with a crime.  Background  A European Arrest Warrant for Bailey by the French government for the murder of Sophie Toscan Du Plantier in Ireland. Bailey resisted the extradition order to France. Bailey had previously been investigated for the murder by Irish authorities but was not charged. The Supreme Court had been told by the High Court to consider the public importance of an extra-territorial jurisdiction to prosecute a person for an offense which the DPP had decided not to prosecute. The Court looked at a number of statutes to decide whether the surrender of Bailey would be a violation of the Irish statutes, or if it is unfair to him, or whether it would be an abuse of power. Ian Bailey was accused of murdering of Sophie Toscan du Plantier some time during 23 December 1996 in Co Cork. On 18 March 2011, the High Court delivered a judgement which decided to surrender Bailey to France. However after the Court certified to the Supreme Court that this case involved a point of law of public importance, Bailey appealed to the Supreme Court. He did so on the basis of section 16(12) of the European Arrest Warrant as amended by section 12 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. The Supreme Court held that the requirements of section 21A of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) had not been satisfied. Meaning, there had been no decision made to prosecute Bailey for the alleged murder of du Plantier by French authorities. Without such a decision, it would be unlawful to extradite him to France. Hence, the appeal was allowed on foot of section 44 of the European Arrest Warrant Act but not on the basis of section 42 of the same Act.  Main issues  The main issue to be considered by the court was how the nationality of Bailey, as an English citizen, having allegedly committed a crime in Ireland would effect the ability of the Irish courts to order his surrender to the issuing state that is France.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The question before the Court was whether the surrender of Bailey is against section 44 of the 2003 Act when the alleged crime was committed in Ireland and when he himself is not a national of the requesting state. An additional problem was that the DPP had decided not to prosecute Bailey due to insufficient evidence. Usually extradition orders are requested when a national of the requesting state commits a crime in that state but flees the country. However, in this case the alleged offence was committed in Ireland. Nevertheless under French laws, the courts there can request for the return of an accused who has murdered a French citizen even if that murder did not happen in France. Also, it is important to note that Bailey was questioned by the Gardai in relation to the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier and his file at the DPP's office had been reviewed multiple times. Yet, the decision to not prosecute him remained the same. This Court had to analyse section 44 of the 2003 Act, section 42 of the same Act as amended by the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (the 2005 Act), section 21A of the 2003 Act as amended by the 2005 Act and finally section 37 of the 2003 Act. Section 44 prohibits the surrender of a person if the offence which is alleged against him or her is executed outside the requesting state or if the alleged offence was committed outside of Ireland. In addition, Bailey is a British citizen. So, under Irish laws only Irish citizens can be susceptible to a charge of murder in Ireland. The High Court judge gave value to interpreting section 44 in light of other sections in the 2003 Act.The lower court judge ultimately concluded that section 44 does not prohibit the surrender of Bailey nor does Article 4(7) of the Framework Decision. However the latter section is not part of Irish legislation. Section 44 allows Ireland to extradite someone who is accused of committing a crime outside the issuing state in circumstances where the Irish State would exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in reciprocal circumstances. The Court decided that it needed to reverse the situation and look at whether the Irish state has any jurisdiction if it was in the shoes of French authorities. Accordingly, it was said that Ireland cannot request for the surrender of a British citizen from France for the murder of an Irish citizen alleged to have been committed by that British citizen. A murder in another state is not an offense which may be prosecuted in Ireland unless it is committed by an Irish citizen. Hence, the Court decided to allow the appeal in relation to section 44 because Bailey cannot be extradited to France when he is not a french citizen. The next issue was section 42 as amended. It states that a person cannot be surrendered where the DPP or the Attorney General has yet to decide whether the person should be prosecuted or not. This does not apply in the case of Bailey because the DPP had already made a decision after reviewing his file. Likewise, section 42(b) also does not apply to Bailey because it says where proceedings are brought against an accused for an offence outlined in the European arrest warrant by the State, that person cannot be surrendered. However, proceedings were not brought against Bailey anyway. Bailey sought to rely on section 42(c) which had been amended. Court said there is no right to not be prosecuted. Decisions of the prosecutor may be influenced or changed if new evidence emerges no matter how compelling the facts of a case are. Denham J said that Bailey has a right to due and fair procedures, but he had not established that he has a right to not be surrendered. Hence, an appeal on the basis of section 42 was not allowed as the law in Ireland is focused on the amended section and not the original subsection c which Bailey relies on. Subsection c was taken out of section 42 after the amendment. The third problem was section 21A of the 2003 Act as amended. Member States of the European Union are obliged to surrender people under the Framework Decision. Section 21A as repealed states that in order to extradite a person, the requesting state must first have decided to charge and put that person on trial. The warrant that the french authorities submitted did not. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal on the first and third grounds of appeal. The Court unanimously overturned the order of the High Court.  Subsequent developments  Bailey successfully resisted extradition again in 2017. French authorities formally charged Ian Bailey and he was convicted in absentia by a French judge in 2019. The French renewed their extradition request following the conviction.

Inscription on the gateway to the Humanitarian worker district, Via Solari 40, Milan. Poster of the first Lombardy regional exhibition of decorative art organized by the Humanitarian Society in 1919. History The Humanitarian Society is one of the longest standing institutions in Milan. It was founded thanks to the determination and mission of Jewish international merchant and enlightened patron, . In 1892, he decided to bequeath his considerable assets (over ten million lire of the time) to ensure that the newly established Humanitarian Society ‚Äì to be managed by Milan Municipal Authority ‚Äì was engaged in every possible way in \\"helping the underprivileged become independent, providing them with support, employment and education, and more generally working to achieve the best educational and socio-cultural development in every sector of individual and collective life.\\"L'Umanitaria e la sua opera, Societ√† Umanitaria, Milan 1922 (in Italian) From the time of its foundation, the secretary of the philanthropic institution was Osvaldo Gnocchi-Viani, promoter of the first Chamber of Labour in Milan. Reformist politicians and intellectuals like Filippo Turati, Emilio Caldara, and above all brothers Ugo and Giulio Pisa, dedicated women like and Maria Montessori, professionals like , Eugenio Quarti, , artists from Arturo Toscanini to Victor de Sabata, all pledged their support. The Humanitarian Society became effective from 1902, after a long legal battle and not without being targeted by some hostility against its mission to promote social justice. It can be said that thanks to its positive achievements, for over twenty years the Humanitarian Society was an important experiment in Italian social and political life. Its officers were elected in public assemblies and their declared intention was to combine assistance and training for employment, social commitment and education, emancipation and culture, thereby growing \\"basic charity into fruitful constructive support.\\"Massimo della Campa, Il Modello Umanitaria, Raccolto-Umanitaria, Milan 2003 (in Italian) In 1904, the Humanitarian Society promoted the establishment of the Istituto di Credito per le Cooperative S.A., contributing a large part of the initial capital. This bank was the financial division for the development, for example, of labour cooperatives active in public procurement. As Enrico Decleva declared, the Humanitarian Society's executive pursued \\"a plan linked to the belief that the improvement of professional skills has a direct and significant influence on the economic condition of the worker, and the parallel certainty that the skilled worker, the accomplished and absolute master of a trade, rarely risks unemployment.\\"Massimo della Campa and Claudio A. Colombo, Spazio ai caratteri. L'Umanitaria e la Scuola del Libro, Raccolto- Umanitaria, Milan 2005 (in Italian) =Worker districts in Milan= From 1902, with and at the helm, the Humanitarian Society devised interesting examples of public housing, with attached educational facilities (Montessori Children‚Äôs Houses, forerunners of the current condominium nursery). From 1905 to 1908, two model quarters were designed by the architect and built in what were then the southwestern suburbs of Milan: in Via Solari, the (First Worker District of the Humanitarian Society); and to the north, the (Second Worker District of the Humanitarian Society), in Viale Lombardia. The two quarters occupied a rectangular area and developed a continuous unit of 12 buildings linked around an exterior perimeter and enclosing a vast courtyard filled with greenery and fenced gardens, perfect for family socialization. Each district had 200 flats of various sizes, from studios to three-room units. An innovative feature for the time, given that the dwellings were for the working classes, was the presence of a small facilities room in each, fitted with a toilet, sink and direct waste pipe down to the cellars. It is no secret that prior to that time, public housing until then was designed with a running balcony and had a single squat-down toilet and a sink per floor and landing therefore shared by several dwellings. The Humanitarian Society was mentioned by Carlo Emilio Gadda in his novel '. =Educational services= The Humanitarian Society was able to propose a solution to underemployment by instituting various types of professional day and evening courses. Employment offices were set up in various Italian cities. One of the most memorable schools of arts and industry was Monza‚Äôs University of Decorative Arts, later called ISIA. The institution also financed a network of worker libraries. The Humanitarian Society set up agricultural offices and promoted consumer cooperatives for farm labourers and factory workers. At the same time, in Italy and Europe, it opened offices for emigrating abroad, the most noteworthy being the in Milan, built in 1907 at the old central railway station. The Society published studies and research on every aspect of labour (unemployment, health conditions, employment offices, alcoholism, work-related illnesses, etc.). From 1924, the government placed the institution, of which Senator was president, under a commissioner. =Resumption of activities after World War 2= The Allied bombings of 1943 razed the buildings in Via Daverio, Via San Barnaba, Via Pace, and Via Fanti to the ground: over 120,000 cubic metres of rubble, but immediately after the War, began a successful reconstruction. The education of young people with lifelong training of adults was resumed. Worker libraries, film clubs and focus on the prison system were re-opened. \\"The reconstruction of a body like the Humanitarian Society appeared a worthy and priority task to me, and justified setting aside direct political involvement,\\" Bauer recalled, \\"even if I still felt the need for political action, but conceived it differently, as a contribution to a cultural and moral political maturity which must be the primary underpinning of a real democracy (...). I immediately began to study a plan that started from the extant degraded situation and went on a material reconstruction of the completely derelict buildings, and then to the operational reconstruction of the institution, which could not fail to have extreme significance in the situation in which the country found itself, having to face social problems that were not easy to solve. I was thinking of a revival and modernization of the venerable and worthy foundation dedicated to the progress of workers and the needy.\\"Arturo Colombo, Il coraggio di cambiare. L'esempio di Riccardo Bauer, FrancoAngeli, Milan 2002 (in Italian) Despite financial difficulties, the body of initiatives and structures set in motion by Bauer was significant. From the reopening of the vocational schools (day and evening, refresher and specialization courses) to the rebirth of the famous ‚ÄúScuola del Libro‚Äù (the book school whose teachers included Bruno Munari and ); publication of a fortnightly emigration bulletin (a working tool for branch offices in direct contact with workers looking to emigrate, but still \\"unable to establish themselves as bodies of serious information because they are absolutely ignorant of any certain information and therefore unable to work efficiently\\"Claudio A. Colombo, Il Bollettino Quindicinale dell'Emigrazione della Societ√† campo d'affari per negrieri d'ogni risma in \\"La stampa di emigrazione italiana\\" by Lorenzo Prencipe, Studi Emigrazione magazine, no.175, July-September 2009, CSER, Rome (in Italian)); the recovery of the centre for social studies; residential adult education courses; the network of cultural service centres activated in Southern Italy on behalf of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno project (in Sardinia, Cagliari, Alghero, Carbonia‚ÄìIglesias are still active). Last but not least, in the 1950s, establishment of secondary schools for employment guidance and placement, the first example of a middle school preparing students for the world of work (in the 1970s merged into a state institution, ITSOS). In 1947, Bauer wrote that \\"The Humanitarian Society is revived with complex initiatives in its sights, aiming for the systematic preparation of tangible social progress, affirming that idea of harmonious technical, moral and civic advancement of workers which has been the soul of the institution since its origins. Suffice it to say that the Humanitarian Society is gradually rising from its ashes to be once more a small world in which all problems encountered by people working and living in society are addressed; in which provisions for enabling tangible improvement, tangible material and moral refinement of the workers in each category are basically studied, developed and implemented.\\"R. Bauer, Del concetto moderno di assistenza sociale e di uncaratteristico istituto assistenziale: la Societ√† Umanitaria, from \\"Rivista degli infortuni e delle malattie professionali\\", no.4, October-December 1947 (in Italian) Then, the long wave of the extreme Left protest reached the institution, Bauer was forced to resign and again it was placed under a commissioner. Then an ill- fated state law revoked the educational authorizations and the schools were taken over by Lombardy Regional Authority. Nonetheless, the Humanitarian Society did not die. Its new executive refashioned its social commitment, giving life to new forms of ‚Äúassistance‚Äù while also developing the cultural machine: in the 1990s, the Humaniter Foundation was founded as a centre for voluntary work, solidarity and leisure. Theatre, music, cinema, art, and poetry summer festivals in the cloisters were put in place, as were competitions and scholarships, not forgetting conferences, refresher courses, exhibitions, and book publications. The Humanitarian Society School The Humanitarian Society School for \\"arts and trades\\" was and still is a historical branch of the Humanitarian Society, even today, in its headquarters in Via Daverio, behind Milan‚Äôs Palazzo di Giustizia. The school was the forerunner to Monza‚Äôs famous ISIA, established in 1922. The first president of the School was lawyer , a member of the educated Milanese bourgeoisie. From 1913 to 1924, he was succeeded by his vice-president, Senator , a private banker and co-owner of the Zaccaria Pisa bank, also active in Milanese public life. Augusto Osimo was designated general manager for two decades. The Humanitarian Society founded by continues its activities today, still pursuing the original statutory purpose, which was to \\"enable the underprivileged, without distinction, to achieve a situation in which they could help themselves, and to work for the professional, intellectual and moral advancement of workers\\".

Many species of animals can be said to be grazers, from large animals such as hippopotamuses to small aquatic snails. Grazing behaviour is a type of feeding strategy within the ecology of a species. Specific grazing strategies include graminivory (eating grasses); coprophagy (producing part- digested pellets which are reingested); pseudoruminant (having a multi- chambered stomach but not chewing the cud); and grazing on plants other than grass, such as on marine algae. Grazing's ecological effects can include redistributing nutrients, keeping grasslands open or favouring a particular species over another. Ecology Green sea turtle grazing on seagrass Many small selective herbivores follow larger grazers which skim off the highest, tough growth of grasses, exposing tender shoots. For terrestrial animals, grazing is normally distinguished from browsing in that grazing is eating grass or forbs, whereas browsing is eating woody twigs and leaves from trees and shrubs. Grazing differs from predation because the organism being grazed upon may not be killed. It differs from parasitism because the two organisms live together in a constant state of physical externality (i.e. low intimacy). Water animals that feed by rasping algae and other micro-organisms from stones are called grazers-scrapers. =Graminivory= Graminivory is a form of grazing involving feeding primarily on grass (specifically \\"true\\" grasses in the Poaceae). Horses, cattle, capybara, hippopotamuses, grasshoppers, geese, and giant pandas are graminivores. Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are obligate bamboo grazers, 99% of their diet consisting of sub-alpine bamboo species. =Coprophagy= The capybara is one of several coprophagous herbivores. Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. They graze heavily and rapidly for about the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit remains outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. Their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem by using a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs and are immediately eaten (coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cattle and many other grazers) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients. Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are herbivores that graze mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,Capybara Facts. Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Retrieved on December 16, 2007. PDF as well as fruit and tree bark.Capybara. Palm Beach Zoo. Retrieved on December 17, 2007. As with other grazers, they can be very selective, feeding on the leaves of one species and disregarding other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available.

During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity. Their incisors can be as long as 40 cm and the canines up to 50 cm; however, the canines and incisors are used for combat, and play no role in feeding. Hippos rely on their broad, horny lips to grasp and pull grasses which are then ground by the molars. The hippo is considered to be a pseudoruminant; it has a complex three- or four-chambered stomach but does not \\"chew cud\\". =Non-grass grazing= Although grazing is typically associated with mammals feeding on grasslands, ecologists sometimes use the word in a broader sense, to include any organism that feeds on any other species without ending the life of the prey organism. Use of the term \\"grazing\\" varies further; for example, a marine biologist may describe herbivorous sea urchins that feed on kelp as grazers, even when they kill the organism by cutting the plant at the base. Malacologists sometimes apply the word to aquatic snails that feed by consuming the microscopic film of algae, diatoms and detritus‚Äîa biofilm‚Äîthat covers the substrate and other surfaces underwater. In marine ecosystems, grazing by mesograzers such as some crustaceans maintains habitat structure by preventing algal overgrowth, especially in coral reefs.

Chatterton (1880-1973) was an American artist whose oils, watercolors, and gouaches, painted in realist style, showed the houses and streets of villages, towns, and harbors of upstate New York and the Maine coast. Critics said his work possessed directness and candor as well as an ability to capture the play and pattern of light. One of them praised his \\"power to find in narrow streets with trolley cars and railway culverts something stimulating in design and warm with a sense of human living.\\" His paintings were, another wrote, \\"smiling without falsification of sentimentality.\\" Chatterton trained at the New York School of Art under Robert Henri, Walter Appleton Clark, and others. Among his fellow students, Edward Hopper and Gifford Beal became studio mates and friends. He was professor of art at Vassar College for many years. There he taught live drawing along with the more usual techniques of landscape and portraiture in oil and watercolor. Early life and training Chatterton was raised in Newburgh, New York, where he attended local public schools through his high school graduation in 1897. While he was in the elementary grades he obtained grudging approval from his father to attend art classes taught by the artist, Lydia Edgar, in nearby Middletown on the understanding that he would draw and paint as a hobby. Shortly after approving the classes Chatterton's father died of consumption, leaving an estate large enough to support the remaining family members. On graduating from high school Chatterton decided he would train to be a professional illustrator. In 1900 he enrolled in the New York School of Art where Howard Chandler Christy and Walter Appleton Clark taught classes in illustration. He chose that school partly because, like Lydia Edgar's, its approach was based on working from life. After studying illustration for two years Chatterton began to study painting in watercolor and oil. He said he made the change when his friend and fellow student, Edward Hopper, told him \\"Chat, it's time you started to paint.\\" At first Chatterton's painting instructors William Merritt Chase, Frank DuMond, Luis Mora, and Kenneth Hayes Miller. Things changed dramatically in 1902 when Robert Henri took DuMond's place and introduced an approach to art that was entirely new to Chatterton. Where before the emphasis had been on visual accuracy in drawing, the new emphasis was on emotional spontaneity. Chatterton said that to Henri \\"the idea and the emotion were all-important, the manner of conveying them negligible.\\" To a meticulous craftsman like Chatterton this was a revolutionary idea. He said, \\"To those of us who were technically clever, this was baffling and occasionally galling,\\" but he nonetheless adopted the method as his own. In addition to Hopper, his fellow students at this time included George Bellows, Gifford Beal, Edward Hopper, Guy P√®ne du Bois, and Rockwell Kent. Leaving the New York School in 1904, Chatterton returned to Newburgh where he lived with his widowed mother and worked out of a studio that he shared with Gifford Beal. Together the two men painted local street and harbor scenes while earning money by making commercial art for local businesses. Career in art C.K. Chatterton, Snow Clad Town, 1908, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches Unlike most professional artists of his time Chatterton rarely contributed works to group exhibitions in commercial galleries. In 1908 a painting of his called \\"Snow Clad Town\\" appeared first in a juried group exhibition at the National Academy of Design and later as part of a traveling exposition held in Argentina and Chile. This painting can be see at left. When, in 1910, Robert Henri began to arrange group shows in New York's MacDowell Club, Chatterton included his paintings along with those of others of Henri's former students. When a painting of his called \\"A Peep at the Side Show\\" was included in an exhibition by the American Watercolor Society in 1912, the critic for the New York Herald described it in detail and said it was \\"a good picture of a not uncommon scene in the rural districts in spring and summer.\\" He showed again at New York Watercolor Club in 1913 and the following year won a prize for best watercolor shown in an exhibition at New York's Salmagundi Club. C.K. Chatterton, Henry Weare's Place, about 1920, oil on panel, 24 x 30 inches There is a gap during the next decade during which there are no records of exhibitions in which Chatterton participated. In that time he married, took up teaching positions, and was employed as a superintendent of art education in the Newburgh public school system. Early on, he spent summer holidays in a rented studio in Newburgh where he made large paintings of the city's street scenes. Later--beginning in 1919--he began to spend summers in the summer resort and art colony of Ogunquit, Maine. This marked a change in his choice of subjects. Where before he mostly painted street and harbor scenes on the Hudson River in the vicinity of Newburgh, he now began to find subjects in the villages on the coast of southern Maine. Chatterton's painting, \\"Henry Wear's Place,\\" of about 1920 (shown at right) is an example of his early work in Maine. When it was shown in 1927, Margaret Breuning of the New York Evening Post said \\"'Henry Weare's Place' with its beautiful elm, and umbrageous fountain spreading its beneficence over the little frame house huddling close to its great trunk, reveals the newer, mellower vein that this artist is developing with no loss of power in statement or design.\\" In 1925 Chatterton convinced the Wildenstein Gallery to mount a solo exhibition of his work and the following year the gallery included his painting \\"Clinton Square, Newburgh\\" in a group of representative American paintings in a traveling exhibition that toured Europe and South America. When Wildenstein gave him a second solo exhibition in 1927 Margaret Breuning said his works were \\"\\"stimulating in design and warm with a sense of human living\\" A critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle added, \\"What Edward Hopper has done for the mansard roof of architecture of the 80's, Chatterton has accomplished for the early American homestead.\\" Later that year Chatterton began a relationship with a gallery owner that would persist for the remainder of the gallery owner's life. The owner was Robert Macbeth and the gallery bore his name. Macbeth, who was a staunch supporter of American artists like Chatterton, had little respect for European modernist influences in American art. Calling these influences \\"bizarre and unintelligible,\\" he said the American public could be relied upon to choose art that was worthwhile over art that was \\"merely amusing.\\" Over the nine years from 1929 to 1938 Chatterton showed paintings in four solo and three group shows at Macbeth. Although he stopped showing in commercial galleries after Macbeth's death in 1940, his work continued to be shown in noncommercial exhibitions in New York and across the country. In 1936 he was one of 40 artists chosen to represent New York City in a national exhibition of American art that was held in the newly completed International Building of Rockefeller Center. In that year and two others his paintings were included in group shows of the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh. He showed at the annual exhibition of American art at the Art Institute of Chicago (1936), the large and successful Municipal Art Exhibit in New York (1936), the Albany Institute of History and Art (1939), the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco (1940), and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington (1935, 1941, and 1943). During the early 1940s Chatterton participated in a number of group exhibitions and one solo exhibition held by the Dutchess County Art Association. Vassar College, where he was professor of art, gave him exhibitions during the same period and in 1947 mounted a major retrospective of works from his own holdings, holdings of private collectors, and the Brooklyn Museum. The following year he was given another retrospective, this one, sponsored by the Hudson River Conservation Society, featured his 1918 painting, \\"Clinton Square, Newburgh.\\" Further retrospective exhibitions occurred in 1959 (at the Bethlehem Art Gallery, Salisbury Mills, N.Y.) and 1963 (at Vassar College). In 1965, for the first time since 1936, his paintings were shown in a Manhattan commercial gallery. George Chapellier, owner of the gallery that bore his name, gave Chatterton a solo exhibition consisting of 50 paintings and drawings dating from 1899 to 1958. Remarkably, 25 works were sold during the first week of the show. After Chatterton's death in 1978 he was given exhibitions at the Robert Rice Gallery in Houston, Texas, (1977), Barrett House in Poughkeepsie (1982), and the ACA Gallery in New York (1989 and 1999). =Artistic style and critical reception= Chatterton shared a common point of view with the men who were students with him at the New York School of Art. They rejected what they saw as unrealistic impressionism and what they considered to be lifeless academic realism. He did not, however, share with them a tendency to show the underside of life in New York City. In this he followed one of Henri's precepts: \\"Do not imitate; be yourself.\\" If he chose not to show urban grittiness, he also chose not to show empty landscapes. Instead he depicted small-town architecture, work-a-day streets and harbors, and, as often as not, people at their ease. Early in his career a critic praised Chatterton for his \\"fresh vision of the world, his power to find in narrow streets with trolley cars and railway culverts something stimulating in design and warm with a sense of human living\\" and credited him with the \\"power to impose formal discipline upon the most refractory of factual motifs and give them coherent harmony of organization and relevance.\\" Another said he possessed a strong, forthright technique and praised his sentiment of place, taking \\"the white houses, the tall elms and dusty streets of New England towns as the important things in a picture.\\" C.K. Chatterton, Girl by the Pond, about 1925, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 inches C.K. Chatterton, The Poplar (Ogunquit, Maine), about 1947, watercolor, 13 1/2 x 19 inches Writing in 1934 of that year's solo exhibition at the Macbeth Gallery, the critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted this sense of place and said Chatterton's point of view was \\"characterized by certain serene enjoyment of actualities that amounts almost to a philosophy of life.\\" He also wrote that Chatterton's \\"manner of setting down his reactions has the integrity of his point of view which is characterized by directness and candor.\\" A year later another critic noted Chatterton's skill in rendering \\"the homey quality of small-town life\\" and remarked on the feeling of peace and quiet he was able to evoke. Writing of a solo exhibition held in 1963 a critic noted another aspect of his style, writing that he was famous for his skill in capturing the play and pattern of light. Although Chatterton's best- known subjects were houses and harbors, he frequently showed figures in either village or (as shown at left) rural scenes. Similarly, although his oil paintings were highly regarded, he was also credited with skill in gouache and (as shown at right) watercolor. Art teacher On leaving the New York School of Art in 1904 Chatterton returned to his childhood home Newburgh where he continued to paint. Not long after the first exhibition of his work in 1908, he obtained employment as an art instructor in a private school near his home. In 1915, against advice from his New York friends but with encouragement from Robert Henri, he took a job as artist-in-residence at Vassar College and in the same year was appointed superintendent of art education in Newburgh public schools. Studio art classes were not then the norm in liberal arts classes and Chatterton's differed from others in having students paint from life in the way he himself had been trained. When, in 1919, Vassar began giving course credit for the art classes he taught, a member of the faculty complained, he later said, that the school \\"might as well give credit for plumbing.\\" After he began spending summers in Ogunquit he began teaching classes there. In 1919, while still retaining his position at Vassar, Chatterton was promoted as head of a new department of industrial art in the Newburgh high school. He gave up this job some years before he received appointment as Vassar's professor of art in 1928. By 1933 the courses he taught at the college included life drawing and painting, portraiture, composition, and landscape. He continued teaching there until his retirement in 1948. Personal life and family Chatterton's father was Charles L. Chatterton (1853-1893). He was a partner in the Newburgh law firm of Round & Chatterton. He died aged 40 of consumption. Chatterton's mother was Julia Lendrum Chatterton (1858-1934). She was the organist at Newburgh's Calvary Presbyterian Church. In 1915 Chatterton married Margaret A. Meakim (1888-1968). She, like her mother-in-law was an organist. A Poughkeepsie native, she received musical training at the New York Institute of Musical Art and during the 1920s and 1930s and until the outbreak of World War II she performed in services and in concerts at Newburgh's Trinity Methodist Church. The couple had one child, a daughter named Julia, born in 1917 or 1918. In 1945 she married J.M. Van De Water, who was then serving in the Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic. She had previously been a teacher in a private school in Baltimore, then an editor on H. L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine, and subsequently a freelance editor. Chatterton was unostentatious and possessed a quiet and retiring demeanor. Students, who called him \\"Chatty,\\" saw him as kindly and sympathetic. At the time of his death Chatterton was living in Poughkeepsie. He died on July 1, 1973, in a nursing home in New Paltz and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Newburgh. External links * C.K.

He was a Colonel in the Illinois militia, which was mobilized as part of the Union Army during the American Civil War and fought valiantly in several major battles. Loomis was also a leader of charitable causes.  Early life and education  Loomis was born at Windsor, Connecticut, on January 5, 1825. Of English descent, his parents were Colonel James Loomis and Abigail (nee Sherwood Chaffee) Loomis. His father was a native of Windsor who was a farmer, merchant, and miller. His mother was a native of Greenfield Hill, Connecticut. She was a descendant of a family that produced a large number of successful medical doctors. Loomis attended public schools of Connecticut as a child. He worked in his father's store when he was a teenager and there received his initial business training.  Business career  At age 23 in 1848, Loomis took over an existing lumber merchant business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The business was successful and in 1852 it moved to Chicago. With James Ludington of Milwaukee he formed a partnership called Loomis & Ludington. The business was a success until 1861, when Loomis entered the American Civil War as a Colonel. In 1864, he left military service and returned to Chicago, only to find his lumber business had been mishandled and destroyed. Since he was interested in this type of business he became a commission merchant. He was successful at this and later became a partner with John McLaren, forming John Mason Loomis & Company. His company on South Water Street was for many years the leading lumber firm of Chicago. Loomis became the treasurer of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company of Ludington when it was formed in 1869. Through his efforts and others of the lumber company the Mason County, Michigan, seat was moved from the village of Lincoln in Mason County to the town of Ludington. Loomis along with Delos L. Filer pledged $1,000 towards a building for the county offices in Ludington which was finished being constructed in 1874. Loomis became the president of this lumber company in 1879. Loomis determined through experimental investigation of boring for salt that the brine of flowing salt water from a well could be distilled to produce usable salt. The Pere Marquette Lumber Company pioneered burning scrap lumber to operate salt distilleries. Other local entrepreneurs followed Loomis' techniques and a salt industry came about in northwestern Michigan. The village of Pere Marquette benefited from these local lumber and salt industries and developed into the city of Ludington.  Military service  Colonel John M. Loomis Loomis became a Captain in the State militia at the age of 18. He became a Navy Midshipman, but became frustrated as he awaited mobilization. He joined the Merchant Marine, traveling to India and other points, returning in 1845 to Chicago. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 Loomis' patriotic spirit was aroused and he was eager to get into the fray. At the time he was already a first Lieutenant in the Chicago Light Guard who had earned himself a reputation for being a devoted and skilled military leader. This prompted Governor Yates to request that Loomis take command of a regiment for service in the field. Yates' request had the support of several influential men in Chicago, to which Loomis accepted. In August 1861, Loomis assumed command of the 26th Illinois Infantry Regiment as colonel. Loomis' regiment participated inter alia in the Battle of Island Number Ten, the Battle of Iuka, the Siege of Corinth, the Siege of Vicksburg, the Battle of Jackson, Mississippi, the Second Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Farmington, Tennessee. As reported in the St. Louis Globe Democrat, he acquitted himself well valiantly and recklessly as he rallied his men at the Second Battle of Chattanooga. He led the 26th at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. One memorial tribute described this accomplishment as \\"a remarkable achievement for a regiment of citizen soldiers.\\" Colonel Loomis was hoping for a promotion to Brigadier General, and was recommended twice by General Ulysses S. Grant for the position, but was always turned down. Loomis also served with the 16th Corps Support Group. During his military career, Colonel Loomis had fought in 57 battles and skirmishes and had marched along with his men for more than 6,900 miles; he resigned his commission on April 30, 1864 due to fatigue. He returned to Chicago and became a prominent real estate owner, while also becoming very active in support of veteran affairs. Colonel Loomis' wife was with him at the front lines while he was stationed in Missouri. She was in charge of a group of nurses.  Personal life  Loomis' father was Colonel James Loomis of Windsor, Connecticut.Together We Served.com, Essay James admired a seventeenth century Major by the name of John Mason who was an officer under Sir Thomas Fairfax. John Mason became a famous officer of the colonial forces in the Indian Wars of New England after he immigrated to America. James named his son after Mason because of Mason's military aptitude. John Mason Loomis married Mary Hunt in 1849. She was the daughter of Milo Hunt of Chenango County, New York. Loomis and his three brothers and one sister all lost their children tragically one way or another within their lifetimes. They decided then with their resources to form the Loomis Institute, which would help educate young boys and girls. They incorporated the Loomis Institute into the Loomis Chaffee School in 1874. It is a New England boarding and day school in Windsor, Connecticut, that, for the first four decades of its operation, offered free education to those between twelve and twenty years of age. Loomis was on the board of directors of the Chicago Relief and Aid Society. This was a Chicago charity for those left homeless and destitute after the fire of 1871. He gave money and time to this charity and other similar charities for twenty years. He was a devout Episcopalian and active in Chicago's Grace Episcopal Church and a big contributor. In politics Loomis was a strong Republican and, though not considered a politician, he was active in the selection of good men for office. Loomis helped organize George H. Thomas Post Number 5 of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1879, Loomis organized the Illinois Commandery of MOLLUS, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, and became its commander in 1884, succeeding Philip Sheridan. Loomis served as Treasurer 1879, head of the U.S. Volunteers (1880‚Äì1883) and Commander 1884. Loomis retired in 1885. He built a home at 55 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, Illinois.Taylor, J.W.

Unlike his contemporaries, Nagata believed in allowing patients to heal without interference. One example of his method is provided by the story of his treatment of a Japanese nobleman who was suffering from a fever: Nagata asked the man what he desired and on being told that his patient felt the need for watermelon, fresh air and cold water, provided these things. The patient recovered despite the treatment being at odds with the teachings of Chinese medicine. Consequently, although his training was in Chinese medicine, he is considered to be one of the main figures in the revival of Japanese medicine, mixing contemporary post-Sung techniques with ancient native practices.

Adam's name is associated with a holy war against an unjust ruler of Vikramapura by the name of Raja Vallalasena Baidya. Biography Baba Adam was living in Makkah as a faqir. One day, a Muslim villager from Kanachang (in Vikramapura) came to him and informed him about the oppression of Vallalasena, a Baidya who ruled the kingdom of Vikramapura. The villager had sacrificed a cow to celebrated his son's aqiqah and for this he was oppressed by Hindu King Vallalasena who viewed cows as sacred. For this, he fled the country and went to Makkah. Hearing this story, Adam went to Vikramapura with 7,000 followers. Vallalasena decided to take action against the Muslims. Adam briefly left the battlefield and retreated to a nearby cave so that he could perform the Asr prayer. The Raja found him and killed him with his sword, thus Adam was martyred; earning him the title of Shahid. Later, Vallalasena and his family lost their lives by throwing themselves into a pit of fire. Legacy Adam was buried in a tomb; now situated in the courtyard of a mosque constructed by Jalaluddin Fateh Shah's officer Malik Kafur in 888 AH (1483-1484 AD).

Since the mid-1970s, it was the third case of a serial killer who operated in the area.  Early years  Little is known about Michael Player's early life. He was born in 1960, and led a criminal lifestyle under the nickname of Marcus Nisby, for which he was prosecuted several times by the Californian authorities in the late 1970s. At the turn of the 1980s, he was convicted of a robbery, and in October 1983, he was arrested while trying commit theft, convicted again and was sentenced to 6 months in prison. In the summer of 1984, he was arrested for illegal possession of weapons, again convicted and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Having received parole in 1985, Player again committed several minor offenses, as a result of which he was arrested for violating the conditions of parole and received a 60-day imprisonment in July 1985.  Murders  As victims, Player chose mostly homeless people who led a marginal lifestyle, attacking them from behind and shooting them execution style. All of the killings were committed in the early hours of the day. The murders began on September 4, 1986, when Player walked up behind 54-year-old Rudolfo Roque and shot him in the back of the head. Roque was not homeless, and had arrived from San Diego a few days earlier for the purpose of visiting a friend. After killing Roque, Michael got rid of the weapon, but failed to escape in time and was detained by police. After being interrogated at the police station, he was released due to lack of evidence. The next five murders were all of homeless people, all of them shot while sleeping. A few days after Roque's killing, Player shot dead 66-year-old Rick Stamps. On September 13th, he shot dead 31-year-old Rojello Sirven and wounded 47-year-old Joseph Griffin in the Skid Row area. Griffin initially survived, despite his serious injuries, but succumbed to his injuries due to complications on October 5th. On September 20th, 66-year-old Marshall Singer was shot in the back of the head. Three days later, Player shot 36-year-old David Towns, after which he committed a double murder. On September 30th, he shot and killed 25-year-old Christopher Boyle and 56-year- old Leon Gaines, in separate attacks. On October 7th, attacked and killed a 23-year-old Korean, Chang Kang. Like the first victim, Kang was not homeless, and had come from Texas so he could visit some relatives. The day after, Player murdered 44-year-old Wayne Ellis in Athens Park while he was sleeping. On October 9th, he attempted to kill Terrence Dunn, but he managed to survive. Dunn provided a description of the attacker to the authorities, on the basis of which a facial composite was created.  Death and exposure  On October 10, 1986, Michael Player shot himself in a Los Angeles hotel. While investigating his death, a search was conducted on the apartment, during which police located bloodstained shoes and two pistols, .38 and .22 caliber, respectively. A ballistic examination subsequently confirmed that all the victims had been killed with the weapons belonging to Player. Terrence Dunn, the only surviving victim, also identified Michael from a photograph as the same man who had tried to kill him on October 9th. Based on these facts, the police pinned all 10 murders on the now-deceased killer, and was announced to media representatives by Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates in February 1987. The reason for Player's suicide, as well as his motive for the murders, remains unclear.

The album was produced by Drew Fulk and it features Andy Leo of Crown the Empire, former Yellowcard frontman William Ryan Key and Underoath's Spencer Chamberlain.  Background  Throughout 2018, Selfish Things were working on their debut album while being on the road to promote their EP Vertical Love. Lead singer Alex Biro chose the title months before the release: \\"I‚Äôve been incredibly fixated by Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst and his grand interpretation of life and the world. To achieve logos is to truly ascend. The whole album revolves around that idea and concept. I had been having a hard time coming up with a name and then I was reading The Red Book and came across that. It just stuck.\\" He explains the idea behind the record: \\"I want people to know that there is strength in your faults. It‚Äôs just as important to suffer as it is to find moments of joy and happiness. Darkness and light need one another.\\" The song titled 'Rowen' is about lead singer, Alex Biro's daughter, Rowen.  Release and promotion  On 26 October 2018, the band released the single, \\"Flood\\". Biro explains: \\"I felt like I needed to find a way to talk about human complacency in the face of destruction beyond gun violence. Our species has this off-putting, innate ability to let things go to shit so long as it doesn‚Äôt directly impact us as individuals.\\" On 22 February 2019, they revealed the single \\"Drained\\", that features William Ryan Key, former singer of Yellowcard. On 26 June 2019, they released \\"Pride\\", a song that \\"defines what it feels like to be the odd man out in a place you don‚Äôt belong.\\" On 4 August 2019, the band announced the details of Logos, and they premiered the single \\"Hole\\", followed by \\"Blood\\" on 30 August. \\"Blood\\" features Andy Leo of Crown the Empire on vocals. On release day, Selfish Things premiered the single \\"Mind\\", accompanied by a music video.  Critical reception  The album has received positive reviews from critics: it has been regarded as an intimate record with a focus on human feelings and vulnerability with a \\"fusion of sound from modern punk, to new age rock, to emo pop-ballad slow burners\\". At the same time, it has been noted that the execution of the tracks is far from perfect, as they are \\"in need of much more development\\" with an \\"amount of potential that doesn‚Äôt feel lived up to whatsoever\\".

Early life  Mary Brosnan was born in 1906 in New York. She attended the Sacred Heart Convent school and studied art at the National Academy of Design school.  Career  Brosnan was portrait painter by training. During the Great Depression, she worked as a window dresser, and when the need arose for a more glamorous mannequin, she created one. She and sculptor Kay Sullivan founded Mary Brosnan Inc., in 1941, providing American-made mannequins to stores during World War II, when European mannequins were difficult to import. Brosnan moved her manufacturing from Manhattan to Long Island in 1947. Also in 1947, her company acquired a patent for a self-standing mannequin, requiring no external stand. Her 1948 mannequins became associated with the \\"New Look\\" of Christian Dior, because they were well-matched in proportions (broad shoulders, slim hips), and Brosnan's mannequins often used in Dior window displays. Brosnan's business was a success, and she was described as one of the \\"top American businesswomen\\" in a 1958 profile. In 1962, Mary Brosnan Inc., a division of D. G. Williams, occupied a 35,000 square-foot plant in Long Island City, with sculptors' studios, casting rooms, drying ovens and other facilities. In 1964 the factory was producing 150-200 mannequins a week. \\"I often wonder where the old mannequins end up,\\" Brosnan mused in an interview that year. \\"Sometimes I imagine there's a big desert somewhere out in Arizona, where they are piled up like used cars.\\" Brosnan won the Neiman-Marcus Fashion Award in 1966. \\"She is the country's most eminent sculptress of the mannequins seen in store windows,\\" explained one report about the award. In 1967 she made the mannequins for a show titled \\"The Art of Fashion\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Brosnan retired after 1973.  Personal life  In 1956, Mary Brosnan married a Vienna-born importer, Robert Kratschmer. She died January 20, 1988, aged 81 years, from cancer, in New York.

It was discovered in 1934 by Jacob Ory and was excavated first by P. L. O. Guy in 1937 and then by Eleazar Sukenik, Shmuel Yeivin and Nahman Avigad in 1937-1938. They discovered a fortress dated to the Iron Age and believed that it was an Israelite fortress built in the 10th or 9th centuries BCE and destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE. However, the archaeologists Oren Tal and Alexander Fantalkin have reviewed the preliminary reports of the excavation and its finds and have concluded that the site was actually constructed in the 8th century during the time of the Assyrian rule and was abandoned ahead of the empire's withdrawal of the country during the late 7th century BCE. Besides the fortress, pottery from the Early Bronze Age, Persian, Byzantine and Early Arab periods was found in the site. Among the pottery found was a Greek jar from the island of Lesbos which is the earliest of its kind in the whole Mediterranean coast. A preservation project was carried out in 2007 by the Israel Antiquities Authority, and the site can now be seen during a walk on the Tel Aviv Promenade. Location Tell Qudadi is on the northern bank of the Yarkon River, just north of its estuary with the Mediterranean Sea. It is now within the municipal boundaries of the city of Tel Aviv. The site controls an historical trade route passing through the Israeli coastal plain linking Egypt with the Levant. The widest river in the coastal plain, the Yarkon River served during some historical periods as a political, social and cultural border. Tell Qudadi controls the passage on the Yarkon's shallow water and allowed its rulers to monitor trade caravans and also trade ships. From the site, other ancient settlements along the Yarkon River could have been seen, including Giv‚Äòat Beth HaMitbachaim, Tell Qasile, Tel Gerisa, Tel Zeton and possibly even Tel Afek. Discovery Until the mid-20th century, Tell Qudadi was known as a sand hill that rose a couple of metres above sea level. An aerial photograph of the site carried out by the German Air Force during World War I in 1917 showed it was completely covered in sand and soil. During Palestine campaign, the mound was used as an Ottoman military stronghold. After the British victory, a war monument was set up by the British to commemorate the battle of the crossing of the Yarkon River. This monument was made of an inscribed marble stone, which was imported from the site of Apollonia‚ÄìArsuf, some to the north. Tell Qudadi was discovered for the first time in 1934 by Jacob Ory when he surveyed the region after it was reportedly robbed. It was declared a site of antiquities when it was listed in booklet of addenda to Mandatory antiquities sites. Excavations and date A trial excavation was conducted in October 1937 on the site by P. L. O. Guy on behalf of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. He discovered a wall from the time of the Persian (Achaemenid) rule of the region in the 6th to the 4th centuries BCE as well as Iron Age and Persian pottery. Salvage excavations were carried out by Eleazar Sukenik and Shmuel Yeivin of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with the help of Nahman Avigad. The excavation lasted from November 1937 to March 1938 and was funded by Pinhas Rutenberg. Two fortress from the Iron Age, one built atop the ruins of the other, were discovered. The site was excavated again in 1941, as part of a preservation plan, and in 1966, before an expansion of the Reading Power Station. As mentioned above, the fortress has two archaeological phases. The first phase, which was securely dated to the late 8th century BCE by Tal and Fantalkin. The walls survived to a maximum height of and were up to wide. The eastern wall was preserved along and the northern wall along . The rest of the walls was probably washed by the sea. The structure was founded on sandstones, and its inner walls were made of mudbricks. The fortress had a central courtyard accessed from the eastern wall. The second phase included a gate accessed by a paved road. Two burnt layers were discovered, which indicated that the fortress had been violently destroyed. Additional pottery from different periods was discovered in the site in a layer of soil on top of the ruins including, the Early Bronze Age III, Persian rule, the Byzantine Empire rule and the Early Arab period.  Dating  Photograph of the ruins from 1981 Yeivin and Avigad disagreed on the date of the construction of the first fortress. Yeivin maintained that it was established in the 10th century BCE, the time of the United Kingdom of Israel. Avigad asserted it was established in the 9th century, after the split into the Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) and Kingdom of Judah. As for the second fortress, the archaeologists claimed it was destroyed in the late 8th century, based on layers of destruction that could be seen inside it. They viewed the reason for the destruction to be part of the 732 BCE military campaign of the Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III in the region. The archaeologists also claimed to have found pottery from the 7th century that showed the site continued to be in use after the destruction. However, the final report of the excavation was never published, and some of their assumptions were disputed by the archaeologists Oren Tal and Alexander Fantalkin in a published in study from 2009. Tal and Fantalkin have examined the notes written by the earlier archaeologists and the pottery they had found. They came to the conclusion that the site was settled not during the Israelite period but no earlier than the late 8th century BCE (the Assyrian campaign took place in 732 BCE), more than a century after the original date given by Sukenik and Yeivin in the 1930s. Therefore, the fortress was built by the Assyrian rulers or their vassals. It was part of a chain of forts built by the Assyrians along the coast. The absence of pottery characteristic of the end of the 7th century BCE dated the abandonment of the fortress to sometime after 650 BCE, around the time of the Assyrian withdrawal of the country. Their view was further supported by a unique find: a Greek amphora (a type of jar used to store oil), from the island of Lesbos. It is the earliest known Lesbian ceramic work in the whole Mediterranean, which may have reached the site by a trade ship.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two white flowers on a thin, sparsely-hairy stem. It is similar to Caladenia flava but is distinguished by its fragrant white versus yellow flowers with prominent red stripes and spots on the dorsal sepal and lateral petals. Caladenia lateritica mimics Conostylis setosa (Haemodoraceae) in terms of flowering time, height, colour and fragrance. It also shares a native bee pollinator with Conostylis setosa, which provides pollen and nectar whereas the orchid is rewardless. Description Caladenia lateritica is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with spheroid, annually replaced tubers situated 8‚Äì15 cm below the soil surface and forming a single, hairy, linear leaf, sometimes with purple veining below, long and wide. There are up to three flowers borne on a slender, sparsely silky-hairy raceme, tall. The sepals and petals are spreading, white with various amounts of red dots and stripes on the dorsal petal and lateral sepals. The dorsal sepal is lanceolate to broadly lanceolate, long. The lateral sepals spathulate, broadly ovate-lanceolate and petals ovate with a single or sometimes multiple red stripes. The labellum is prominently trilobed with a raised yellow plate near the base of the middle lobe, yellow at the base, with rows of white calli extending from either side of the plate and the lateral lobes suffused with pink, long. The column is curved over the raised central plate, yellow, with prominent, white, lateral wings. This Caladenia is similar to C. flava fragrant white versus yellow flowers with prominent red stripes and spots on the dorsal sepal and lateral petals. It is sometimes confused with C. flava subsp. sylvestris, which flowers later and has sepals and petals that are yellow at the base. Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of this orchid was by Kingsley Dixon and Maarten Christenhusz in 2018, but the species was initially not adopted by Florabase. However, this was a taxonomic confusion as the two taxa are clearly separated by flower colour, flowering time, pollinators and scent. Distribution and habitat Caladenia lateritica is only found on isolated lateritic plateaux south of Dwellingup and north-east of Waroona in south-western Western Australia, often forming extensive pure stands or co- occurring with Caladenia rosea. They grow in shallow lateritic regolith that overlay massive bauxite, in open woodland comprising an overstory of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), marri (Corymbia calophylla) and parrot bush (Banksia sessilis), with an understory of Conostylis setosa, Orthrosanthus laxus, Xanthorrhoea preissii, Hypocalymma robustum, Phyllanthus calycinus and Stylidium species. Ecology Caladenia lateritica grows with white cottonhead (Conostylis setosa, Haemodoraceae), with which it shares a similar stature, flower colour, scent and flowering time. The widespread and common Caladenia flava subsp. flava, to which this taxon has similarities, occurs rarely in the shallow soils, open forest and well drained plateau areas where C. lateritica occurs, indicating that the new taxon has an ecological preference for the unusual geology and climate of these high plateaux. Although the species may have occurred more extensively in the region, much of the suitable habitat of similar topography and geology in the 1000‚Äì1200 mm rainfall zone have been now mined or are currently being mined.

It lies south of the Yarkon River. The mound rises to a height of above its surroundings and spans an area of 2‚Äì3 dunams (1 acre). The site was inhabited in the Middle Bronze Age and later in the Iron and Persian periods. Jacob Kaplan identified the fortified settlement from the Persian period as a Jewish settlement from the time of the Return to Zion in the 5th century BCE, thanks to an ostracon bearing a Hebrew name which appears in the Hebrew Bible from the time of Nehemiah, a Jewish governor appointed by the Achaemenid Empire to govern the autonomous Jewish province. The site was inhabited as late as the 10th century CE, during the Roman, Byzantine, Early Arab, and Mamluk periods. Tel Zeton was suggested in 1938 as the location of Gath-Rimmon mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. Kaplan supported this identification while Benjamin Mazar rejected it. If correct, Tel Zeton should also be identified with two cities mentioned in Egyptian sources from the 14th and 15th centuries BCE.  Excavations  The site was excavated four times. The first time was by Jacob Kaplan in 1957, on behalf of the Israel Exploration Society, promoted by the Beit Zvi center. The excavation lasted a month and yielded findings of the Persian period and halted upon reaching remains from the Iron Age. In 2000 the site was excavated by Haya Katz and revealed pottery from the Iron Age and the Persian periods. The third excavation was headed by Dor Golan in 2005 and revealed remains from the Middle Bronze Age. The fourth excavation took place in 2015 by Angelina Dagot, west of the site and revealed several installations and pottery from various periods from the Iron Age to the Mamluk rule.  History  = Bronze and Iron Ages (2000 - 538 BCE) = The 2005 excavation revealed a settlement layer from the Middle Bronze Age II (early 2nd millennium BC). It was part of a series of settlements along the Yarkon River stretching between the large sites of Tel Gerisa and Tel Afek. Kaplan excavated a fortified Iron Age settlement, dated to the Iron Age II period (1000-538 BCE). In 2015 an excavation revealed that the settlement's agricultural territory extended at least west of the mound, where what seems to be a silo was found. = Persian period (538 - 332 BCE) = Sketch of the Inscription After the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire by the Achaemenid Empire in 538 BCE, the region of the coast was administered as a province called \\"Dor\\". Two archaeological phases for that time were discovered during Kaplan's 1957 excavation. Kaplan identifies this settlement as a Jewish settlement from the time of the Return to Zion. Among the discoveries were a typical Persian-period stamp seal, Persian-styled, and imported Attican pottery. These pottery types are dated to the 5th century BCE. An excavation on the eastern side of the mound has revealed that the settlement was walled and did not cover the entire area of the mound. One significant discovery was an Aramic ostracon which was part of a large jug used to store olive oil or wine. The name \\"Hashub\\" was incised on the jug and Kaplan asserted it was the name of a household to whom the jug belonged. All appearances of the name in the Hebrew Bible are of a family name from the time of the Return to Zion, equivalent to the time of the early Persian rule when this jug was created. One particular mention in the Book of Nehemiah and the Books of Chronicles, is of a man named \\"Shmaya Ben Hashub\\", of the Merarite clan of the Tribe of Levi, who is among those who resettled Jerusalem and rebuilt its walls in the 5th century BCE, under Persian governor Nehemiah.1 Chronicles, 9:14; Nehemiah, 11:15 There are two other examples of Jewish names found in excavations of Persian sites in the territory of Dor. These are Tell Qasile (\\"Ashanyahu servant of the King\\") and Tel Michal (\\"Hanan son of Skwy\\"), both in the same geographic region of Tel Zeton. = Later periods = The western excavation revealed pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (1st century BCE to 1st century CE), Byzantine period (4th-7th centuries CE), Ayyubid and Abbassid periods (7th-10th centuries CE) and the Mamluk period (12th-16th centuries CE). Kaplan identified modern Muslim graves on the mound.  Identification  Tel Zeton in 1926 F√©lix-Marie Abel identified the site in 1938 with Gath-Rimmon, mentioned in the Book of Joshua as a Levite town in the territory of the Tribe of Dan. Gath-Rimmon is listed next to the Yarkon River and the cities of Yahud and Bnei Brak, in the vicinity of the site. It is believed to be the same city mentioned as Knt in the list of cities defeated by Pharaoh Thutmose III in the 15th century BCE and also the city of Gimteti, which appears in one of the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. All of the Hebrew and Egyptian mentions of a city in the region of the Yarkon river by the name of Gath, Gimteti or Knt, suggest that it was an administrative center on the mouth of the Yarkon. Benjamin Mazar rejected Abel's identification of Gath-Rimmon with Tel Zeton and suggested the nearby Tel Gerisa instead because it is bigger than Tel Zeton and therefore more likely to be mentioned by the sources. After Jacob Kaplan's excavation on the site and the discovery of the \\"Hashub\\" ostracon, he supported Abel's identification, as the discovery of the ostracon may suggests it was resettled by Levites.

On April 1, 1943, the congregation merged with the Johannesburg West Reformed Church (GKSA) (founded on December 13, 1930) and took on the latter's name. On October 22, 1950, Johannesburg West re-seceded and the main Johannesburg congregation was restored, and in 1952 it was renamed to Johannesburg-Mayfair. In 1986, Johannesburg-Mayfair, the Johannesburg East Reformed Church (GKSA) (founded February 29, 1924), and the Johannesburg Central Reformed Church all merged under the Johannesburg Reformed Church (restored) banner, but most of the suburbs that had been part of Johannesburg-Melville stayed in Johannesburg West. In 1997, Johannesburg-Melville was reformed from a merger of Johannesburg (restored) and the Johannesburg North Reformed Church (GKSA) (founded on March 1, 1924). In 1998, Johannesburg West and the Delarey Reformed Church merged as the Bergbron Reformed Church. Finally, Johannesburg- Melville was absorbed by the Randburg Reformed Church (GKSA) in 2002, joined by the Randburg East Reformed Church the following year.  Background  The many GKSA members in the Johannesburg area had no congregation of their own for 10 years after the city's foundation in 1886. A pastor from Pretoria served the area, where a number of members purchased a few farms on Mint Road in Fordsburg to build a church for ¬£719. This church was destroyed by a dynamite explosion on February 19, 1896, but the Relief Committee paid the congregation ¬£750 in compensation. The General Conference of the Transvaal GKSA on March 16‚Äì17, 1896 in Heidelberg authorized the secession of Krugersdorp and Johannesburg congregations from the Rustenburg Reformed Church (GKSA). On April 25, Krugersdorp's formal foundation ceremony was attended by the Rev. Johannes de Ridder, elders H.P. Steyn and Ammi Venter (Rustenburg); and the Rev. J.L. Murray and elders J.A. Bezuidenhout and G.A. van der Walt (Potchefstroom). The Rev. P.S. Snyman of Heidelberg was chosen as the consulent. Elder S. Potgieter, assigned by the church council to buy farms from the government for a church building, acquired two plots: Vrye Gunst near what is now Piet Retief and Nooitgedacht in the Rustenburg area. Plots 15-17 and 136 were thus bought from the South African Republic (ZAR) government in October 1899. In May 1904, the eight-year-old congregation finally had a functioning church and parsonage, but financial troubles still dogged it, and the Krugersdorp council meeting of October 20, 1896, already fielded requests to remerge with the Johannesburg congregation.  Johannesburg congregation founding  The Johannesburg congregation was established with 200 confirmed charter members on May 23, 1896. The general conference authorizing its foundation was attended, other than the aforementioned, by the Rev. Petrus Postma and elders R. Turkstra and P.P. Jordaan (absent upon notice) of the Pretoria Reformed Church (GKSA) and the Rev. Snyman (consulent of Krugersdorp) and elders S.J.S. du Preez and W.H. Ackermann. Its size is shown by the founding charter's article 4: ‚ÄúThe Johannesburg congregation includes members living in the following farms and towns: Boksburg, Elandsfontein, Germiston, Rietfontein, Jeppestown, Doornfontein, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, Ophirton, Turffontein, Booysens, Langlaagte, Maraisburg, Florida, [and] Auckland Park.‚Äù The congregation was divided into four districts led by the following brothers: Tjaart van der Walt, Jacob Petrus Kruger, Petrus Carolus Duvenhage, and Johannes Coetsee (elders); and Johannes Lodewikus Venter, Pieter Stoker, Andries Gerhardus Nienaber, and Louis Stephanus Steyn (deacons). The first pastor candidate interviewed, Rev. Snyman, declined, but the Rev. Marthinus Postma accepted and was invested on August 28, 1897. Church and parsonage construction were the main struggles during the local land rush, and the land of the former first church on Mint Road was no exception, ultimately sold with the sites in Fordsburg for ¬£1,050. The rebuilt second church near the old site was built during the lifetime of the Rev. Willem Johannes de Klerk (1875-1943) and would be sold after the Rev. Postma's death in 1926. It served the congregation until the 1930 merger with Johannesburg West. By 1897, the Johannesburg congregation had 350 confirmed and 700 baptized members. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, members from Benoni, Brakpan, and Springs also attended the Johannesburg services, giving the Rev. Postma an area stretching around 70 mi (more than 110 km) from Randfontein to Springs. The need for a second pastor had to await the end of the war, though the third GKSA congregation on the Rand was founded in 1905 in Germiston.  War years  At the September 9, 1899 church council meeting in Krugersdorp, Rev. Postma and Eld. S. Potgieter agreed to consider the ‚Äúextraordinary local conditions in light of the war between England and these Republics‚Äù while planning communion services for the second Sunday in October. According to the notes, ‚Äúthe pastor also proposed home visits for October, but the Church Council rendered this impractical.‚Äù At the December 2, 1899 meeting, half the council was absent as were ‚Äúmany of the brethren‚Äù in the congregation on the battlefield. The notes started in article 2 that ‚Äúthe pastor expounded on the war that had broken out in the month of October between England and the two Republics ‚Äì the South African Republic and the Orange Free State.‚Äù The council decided to have congregation members appointed to serve in the stead of enlisted councilors. However, these could rarely be secured, and there would be no meetings between March 30, 1900 and November 8, 1901, while the Rev. Postma would not return until June 2, 1903. Some congregation members became POWs in Ceylon and Portugal. Among those was the Rev. Postma, who was released on parole after more than two years of captivity, but he stayed in East London to support his family teaching. ‚ÄúBy the grace of God‚Äôs benevolence,‚Äù as the council notes put it, the Rev. Dirk Postma, Jr. of Rustenburg was on hand in Krugersdorp to minister to the locals as well as prisoners at the concentration camp in town, who hailed from Pretoria, Griqualand West, Heidelberg, and Rustenburg. The Krugersdorp council lent money to internees, beginning to donate it outright as conditions deteriorated. Rev. Marthinus Postma, however, was sent abroad for refusing a loyalty oath. The December 27, 1902 council notes report: The pastor asked the brother elders as the year neared an end if spiritual life in the church made progress, stagnated, or declined. A wide-ranging, quiet, serious discussion ensued. The elders concluded that the rod of war had made some more humble and receptive to the word of the Lord and salvation in Jesus Christ. However, the elders also generally concluded that the spiritual state of the congregation left much to be desired. Spiritual life could not possibly withstand such heavy divine wrath as the recent war; worldly and frivolous pursuits tempt many in this seductive world, and there is not enough love and unity among the worshipers themselves or that fire and zeal and interest in the affairs of God's eternal kingdom that should be there. In dire financial straits, the church sold valuable possessions. Only the taxes could be paid on the new church building of the Johannesburg congregation when it opened in 1903. Banks ran low, and while farms burned and livestock grew lean, city-dwellers made meager wages save for a few of the miners crawling deep underground in dry, unventilated mines. The Transvaal Colony Repatriation department offered a ¬£1,200 loan to the congregation, which was rejected at the January 26, 1904 meeting as shifting government obligations onto the church. After the war, people moved in greater numbers to cities, particularly Johannesburg, once more. This grew the congregation to the point where the building on Mint Road (south of Main Street) had become too small and was sold for ¬£3,000, to be replaced in 1903 by the edifice north of Main (now Albertina Sisulu Road) costing ¬£3,750.  Growth years  At the beginning of 1904, the Krugersdorp-Johannesburg merger came to an end. On January 14, 1905, Dirk Postma of the Burgersdorp Theological Seminary, the eldest son of Rev. M. Postma, was invested by his father as pastor of Krugersdorp. 16 months later, however, the younger Rev. Postma left to head the Burgersdorp Reformed Church (GKSA). His cousin Dirk du Plessis (likewise a grandson of the elder Dirk Postma) became consulent for several years and later pastor in Krugersdorp. In 1904, the Rev. M. Postma left the Rand for Pretoria, replaced by the Rev. De Klerk (Heidelberg Seminary, 1903-1904), who also served as consulent in Krugersdorp along with Totius after the latter left Potchefstroom. In 1907, Rev. De Klerk left for the Aliwal North Reformed Church (GKSA), and in 1908 the Krugersdorp congregation was folded into the Johannesburg one once more. After many interviews, the Rev. M. Postma (who had since moved from Pretoria to the Waterberg Reformed Church (GKSA)) returned for a second stint to end an 18-month vacancy, serving this time until his death. He served Krugersdorp until the final and permanent separation in 1910. Further expansion forced the Transvaal General Conference to found a third congregation, Germiston, in March 1905. The first consulent, the Rev. H.J.R. du Plessis, had spent 11 years serving Germiston and Bethal after the Rev. J.C. van der Walt was hired. Afrikaners made up an increasing share of the local mining workforce from 1909 onward, thus swelling the ranks of the GKSA on the Rand. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tensions ran high and many members ended up in prisons and camps or paying fines for participating in armed uprisings.  The arrival of the Rev. J.V. Coetzee  In June 1915, proponent J.V. Coetzee became the curate of Johannesburg. He described his acclimation there as follows: I had accepted the position of curate of Johannesburg and came to start work in June 1915, just after a frenzied mob there had looted and burned German stores and businesses, intercepted subsequently by a pickaxe- and club-wielding assembly of Boer commandoes by the subway station. Many of the congregation members were in that militia protecting the Fordsburg-Vrededorp line, and continued to keep a close eye on things. In December 1918, after several interviews with other applicants, Rev. Coetzee was invested as co-pastor of Johannesburg, a rarity in the GKSA necessitated by the unique conditions in town. There was precedent in the Netherlands, however. The Rev. Coetzee stated: ‚Äúas far as I know, it was the first time in the history of our church that a congregation had two pastors, except for the early years of the Seminary in Burgersdorp when one of them was a school docent reimbursed by the congregation for part of his salary.‚Äù There were thus now four pastors on the Rand, including the two in Johannesburg and the ones in Krugersdorp and Germiston. From 1919‚Äì1923, the Rev. J.H. Boneschans served as pastor of Germiston, succeeding J.C. van der Walt after the latter left for the Piet Retief Reformed Church (GKSA). The Germiston congregation now covered the entire East Rand from Germiston to near Springs. The peaceful cooperation of the four pastors (the Revs. M. Postma, D.P. du Plessis, Coetzee, and Boneschans), their council colleagues, and the congregations at large belied tensions that arose once more at the end of 1921.  The Rand Rebellion  The Rand Rebellion of 1922 had a major impact on the congregations of the Rand. The Rev. Coetzee, an eyewitness to the Rebellion, wrote the following: The widespread labor unrest in 1921 that culminated in 1922 in armed conflict on the streets of Johannesburg greatly disrupted church life on the Witwatersrand. Many members spent months out of work, and church finances were severely strained. Collections fell sharply and pastors‚Äô estates fell into arrears. When the dust settled, a large share of the congregation was in prison or interned in Wanderers Stadium. Nearly all males in Fordsburg, Vrededorp, and Newlands were held on that cricket ground. Authorities spent days apprehending people. Heavily tried by the crisis, the Germiston congregation took on the Rev. D. Rumpff of the Heidelberg Reformed Church (GKSA) as co-pastor. From 1924‚Äì1927, the Rev. Philippus de Klerk worked in Germiston, since the Rev. Boneschans had left for the Venterstad Reformed Church.  Founding of new congregations  The western suburbs of Johannesburg were showing significant growth, including the founding of new districts, just as much as the East Rand. The Johannesburg East and North congregations seceded at the beginning of 1924 under the joint pastorate of Rev. Coetzee while Rev. M. Postma continued to lead the mother church until his death in 1926, when he was replaced by Rev. W.J. de Klerk for the second time. At the beginning of 1925, Johannesburg East and North got their own pastors, East sharing Rev. T.T. Spoelstra with Bethal and North hiring F.P.J. Snyman away from the Molteno Reformed Church (GKSA). The Rev. Snyman would work at Johannesburg North until his death on August 15, 1945. Two more congregations arose on the Rand in 1926, namely the Brakpan Reformed Church (GKSA) on the East Rand and the Vereeniging Reformed Church (GKSA) westward, the latter of which would eventually be considered part of the Rand Ring. Four years later, in 1930, arose the Johannesburg South Reformed Church (GKSA) and Johannesburg West; in 1935, so did the Benoni Reformed Church (GKSA) and the Springs Reformed Church (GKSA); in 1936 came the Boksburg Reformed Church (GKSA); in 1938 followed Delmas Reformed Church (GKSA), another Rand Ring congregation; and 1939's foundation of the Alberton Reformed Church (GKSA) and 1942's establishment of the Florida Reformed Church (GKSA) rounded out the pre-war set. From 1950 to 1954, the following joined them: the Buffeldoorns Reformed Church (1949); the Linden Reformed Church (GKSA) (1950); the Randfontein Reformed Church (GKSA) (1950); the Vanderbijlpark Reformed Church (GKSA) (1951); the Carleton Reformed Church and Johannesburg Central Reformed Church (1953); the Delarey Reformed Church (1954); and the Krugersdorp West Reformed Church (GKSA) (1954).  Church operations  Concerned with reports of declining attendance in the GKSA area, Rev. Spoelstra began emphasizing missionary work, first enlisting the local Dorcas society to distribute more literature in hospitals. At a meeting of the General Conference of Rand Missionaries in 1929, concerns were raised that non-GKSA literature was being distributed while the Church itself remained ‚Äúsilent on our Reformed principles.‚Äù Unchurched Afrikaners thus remained a major concern. Therefore, the Johannesburg Central congregation was founded in 1952 in the city center to, in its founders‚Äô words, ‚Äúactively evangelize among the stray children of the covenant who have lost all contact with the church in the impersonal city spirit.‚Äù Poor attendance of members there remained a major concern, however, at around 27% for morning services and 15% for evening ones. The GKSA actively pursued missionary work elsewhere on the Rand. Starting in 1950, Rev. Hugo du Plessis, missionary pastor of Johannesburg North, ministered to the black townships west of the city. Other area congregations supported the work, as did the Rev. J.A. Schutte of Johannesburg North. In 1955, the Moroka missionary congregation already boasted 515 members. The Rev. Du Plessis, who would be succeeded by Rev. P.G. Geertsema, began training black pastors and assistants in January 1956, leading to the foundation of the independent Dube congregation in November 1957.

It is a terrestrial orchid with a single hairy leaf and up to three pink flowers on a thin, sparsely-hairy stem. It is similar to Caladenia flava but is distinguished by the perianth being pink to dark pink with prominent red striping and spotting on the dorsal sepal and lateral petals. Caladenia rosea mimics Hypocalymma robustum (Myrtaceae) in terms of flowering time, colour and scent. Description Caladenia rosea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with spheroid, annually replaced tubers situated 8‚Äì15 cm below the soil surface and forming a single, hairy, linear leaf, tinged purple and usually with darker purple veining below, long and wide. There are up to three flowers borne on a slender, fine, sparsely silky-hairy raceme, tall, with a bract in halfway up the stem. The sepals and petals are spreading, pink throughout with various amounts of deeper pink dots and stripes. The dorsal sepal is linear to ovate lanceolate, long. The lateral sepals spathulate to ovate-lanceolate and petals ovate usually with a single darker pink stripe. The labellum is prominently trilobed with a raised yellow plate near the base of the middle lobe, yellow at the base, with rows of white calli extending from either side of the plate and the lateral lobes suffused with pink, long. Column is curved over the raised central plate, yellow with prominent white lateral wings. Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of this orchid was by Kingsley Dixon and Maarten Christenhusz in 2018, but the species was initially not adopted by Florabase. It was confused for the hybrid C. √ó spectabilis, which does occur in the are, but has orange flowers and occurs in very small numbers, whereas this species is fertile and is known from larger populations. Distribution and habitat Caladenia rosea grows sympatrically with Caladenia lateritica in shallow lateritic regolith that overlays massive bauxite. The open jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and marri (Corymbia calophylla) woodland has an understory of Banksia sessilis, Conostylis setosa, Hypocalymma robustum, Orthosanthus laxus, Xanthorrhoea preissii, Phyllanthus calycinus and Stylidium species. Ecology Caladenia rosea is putatively mimicking flowers of the Swan River myrtle (Hypocalymma robustum), which has a similar colour and scent. We assume that this orchid is pollinated by the same insects as Hypocalymma robustum (probably native bees). As for Caladenia lateritica, C. rosea is restricted to the shallow soils overlaying massive bauxite in a confined, high rainfall region that is now subject to strip mining for bauxite. The species is therefore threatened with extinction.

It was characterized by a rejection of historicism and traditional architectural forms, and a flamboyant use of floral and vegetal designs, sinuous curving lines such as the whiplash line, and asymmetry. It was most prominent in architecture, appearing in department stores, apartment buildings, and churches; and in the decorative arts, particularly glassware, furniture, and jewelry. Besides Guimard, major artists included Ren√© Lalique in glassware, Louis Majorelle in furniture, and Alphonse Mucha in graphic arts, It spread quickly to other countries, but lost favor after 1910 and came to an end with the First World War. History =The Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1895)= Art Nouveau had first appeared in Brussels, in houses completed in 1893 by Victor Horta, Paul Hankar, and Henry van de Velde, but it quickly appeared in other forms in Paris. It was introduced by the Franco-German art dealer and publisher Siegfried Bing, who wished to break down the barriers between traditional museum art and decorative art. In 1891, he had founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize Japonism in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them Pierre Bonnard, F√©lix Vallotton, √âdouard Vuillard, Toulouse-Lautrec and Eug√®ne Grasset which included both more traditional gallery paintings and paintings designed especially for decoration. The Swiss‚ÄìFrench artist Grasset was already making early posters in the Art Nouveau style in 1893. In 1895, Bing opened a new gallery at 22 rue de Provence in Paris, the Maison de l'Art Nouveau, devoted to works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect Henry van de Velde. The Maison de l'Art Nouveau showed paintings by Georges Seurat, Paul Signac and Toulouse-Lautrec, glass from Louis Comfort Tiffany and √âmile Gall√©, jewelry by Ren√© Lalique, and posters by Aubrey Beardsley. Bing wrote in 1902, \\"Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies.\\" File:Eugene Grasset, poster for Grafton Galleries, 1893.jpgPoster by Eug√®ne Grasset for Grafton Galleries (1893) File:H√¥tel Bing en 1895.jpgMaison de l'Art Nouveau (1895) at 22 Rue de Provence, 9th arrondissement (1895) File:Galeries Bing entr√©e rue de Provence.jpgThe Maison de l'Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing File:Vallotton pour Bing.jpgPoster by F√©lix Vallotton for the new Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1896) = A change in the municipal laws and the Facade competition (1898‚Äì1902) = One great limitation on the architecture of Paris at the end of the 19th century was a law, dating to the 1607 but still in effect in 1900, limitling the height and ornament on the facades and forbidding any elements of architecture that protruded over the sidewalk below. This was done to allow greater light to the narrow streets and to prevent pieces of masonry falling on the street below. Exceptions were often made, but the law greatly limited the freedom of architects. In 1902 the director of public works of Paris, Louis Bonnier, announced a reform of the law, which followed the model of other European cities. The new rules, put into effect in 1902, used proportionality as the standard; the wider the street, the higher the buildings could be, and the more variety of architecture and ornament the architects could use on the facade. Even before that, to encourage greater creativity, the City of Paris decided to hold a competition for the six most original facades. beginning with buildings completed in 1898. One of the winners in 1898 was Hector Guimard's Castel B√©ranger, the first Art Nouveau residence in Paris. =The Paris Universal Exposition (1900)= The Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 marked the summit of Art Nouveau in Paris, bringing together many of the artists and designers who pioneered the style, and making the style known to the forty-eight million visitors to the Exposition. Art Nouveau architecture was highlighted in the interiors of the two major pavilions of fine arts, the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. It was also prominent in the Palace of Decorative Arts, where works of Louis Majorelle and Ren√© Lalique, Daum, and other French designers were displayed. The Paris M√©tro, completed shortly after the Exposition opened, featured the Art Nouveau edicules designed for the stations by Hector Guimard. Architecture =Hector Guimard's residential buildings= The residential architecture of Art Nouveau or Modern Style, as it was also known, was a reaction against the electric and historical styles that dominated Paris in the Belle √âpoque. A majority of the buildings in the new style were constructed in the wealthy 16th arrondissement. The first was the Castel B√©ranger (1895‚Äì98) by Hector Guimard, built shortly after he visited Brussels, met Paul Hankar and toured the H√¥tel Tassel, the town house completed by Victor Horta in 1893, and which had a major impact on his style.Poisson, Michel, 1000 Monuments de Paris (2009), pp. 180-181 Many of the details of the Castel B√©ranger were Neo-Gothic in inspiration, including the gable windows and rain gutters. It was assembled with a multitude of materials and colors, including stone, brick and iron, and with a boldness of imagination, including curling vegetal and floral designs in wrought iron decoration around the doors and windows. The building won the competition for the best facade in Paris in 1898, and, along with his own astute marketing, launched Guimard's career. He became the most famous of Art Nouveau architects.Plum, Gilles, Paris Architectures de la Belle Epoque (2014), pg. 38 Late in the period, between 1909 and 1912, Guimard designed a residence and studio for himself, as well as a painting studio for his wife. the H√¥tel Guimard at 122 Avenue Mozart (16th arrondissement). This building represented his less exuberant and more refined later style, as did the H√¥tel Mezzara (1910), (60, rue de La Fontaine, (16th) Other notable Guimard buildings in Paris include the early H√¥tel Delfau (1895), at Rue Molitor (16th), and the later H√¥tel Jass√©d√© (1903‚Äì1905) at 142 Avenue de Versailles (16th), notable for its striking asymmetric angle on the corner. The H√¥tel Mezzara, (1910) at 60 rue de La Fontaine ((16th) was more classical in style, but also had an interesting asymmetric wing and his characteristic curves, arches, and floral wrought iron designs. He also designed an Art Nouveau synagogue in 1913 (see religious buildings). He designed a number of other buildings just before and after World War I which were not in the Art Nouveau style.

They were prefabricated for easier installation, and one hundred and forty coverings were put into place. Most were installed in 1900. Nearly all were removed a few years later, but many were recreated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Only two of the original edicules from 1900 are still in use; one is Abbesses (Paris M√©tro) station. It was originally at H√¥tel de Ville (Paris M√©tro) but was moved to its present location in the 1970s. The other is at Porte Dauphine (Paris M√©tro). It is the only edicule still in use and still at its original location.

He is best known for a group of several buildings in the 7th arrondissement, particularly the Lavirotte Building at 29 Avenue Rapp (7th arrondissement), completed in 1901, and a winner of the Paris facade competition in that same year. The particular feature of the building is the lavish ceramic sculptural ornament on the facade, which was intended as an advertisement for the Paris ceramics firm of Alexandre Bigot. Lavirotte made another extravagant facade in the same neighborhood, at 3 Square Rapp (7th arr.) and another, the so-called Ceramic Hotel on the other side of the Seine, at 34 Avenue de Wagram (8th around.) (1905) This building was a facade competition winner in 1905. The exuberant style of Lavirotte was pushed even further by architect Alfred Wagon, who is best known for the building at 24 Place √âtienne Pernet (15th arrondissement), made for a building contractor named Duroc, and covered with sculpted vegetation. It is considered one of the most extravagant examples of Art Nouveau in Paris.

It was often blended with neo- classicism and other Belle-Epoque styles. It was used by companies which wanted to show they were modern, but would not take any risks. One example is the La Semeuse Building (1912), Frantz Jourdain for the offices of La Semeuse de Paris, the financial institution that provided credit to the La Samritaine department store. Much of the building has been modernized, but the entrance features an Art Nouveau door and ironwork and stained glass windows by the architect's son.

Since gas lighting risked fires, and the reliable tungsten filament for electric light bulbs was not available before 1902, The buildings ere illuminated by large glass skylights over circular courtyards, ringed by galleries open to the courtyard. The most famous example is the Galeries Lafayette department store on Boulevard Haussmann, built by architect Georges Chedanne and his pupil Ferdinand Chanut. The building was begun in 1895, and the central dome and Art Nouveau staircases accessing it we're completed in 1912. Two later interior courtyards were destroyed in earlier remodeling, but the central courtyard, with its colorful glass cupola, has been restored, along with the Art Nouveau stairways. The department store La Samaritaine at 13 rue de la Monnaie (1st arr.) on the right bank of the Seine, was designed Frantz Jourdain and opened in 1905. It had a stylized Art Nouveau exterior and glass-covered interior court. A second building in Art Deco style by Henri Sauvage was added in 1926. The original building was entirely remodeled in 2018, while preserving the Art Nouveau facades and some of the elements of the interior. The style was also used in a number of smaller Paris shops, though few survive in their original form. One shop, the jewelry shop of designer Georges Fouquet, with an interior by graphic artist Alphonse Mucha, is now found in the Carnavalet Museum of the history of Paris.

File:MuchaFouquet3.jpgThe jewellery shop of Georges Fouquet at 6 Rue Royale designed by Alphonse Mucha, now in the Carnavalet Museum (1901) =Churches= Several churches were built in Paris which incorporated Art Nouveau features, usually combined with other styles, including neo-Gothic. The most notable example of Art Nouveau- Gothic is the √âglise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre (1894). The architect was Anatole de Baudot, a follower of Viollet-le-Duc, a professor of French architecture at the School of Chaillot, which trained experts in historical restoration, and professor of medieval architecture at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts. Following the ideas of Viollet-le-Duc, he used modern materials, including an iron frame interior, combined with sculpture by Pierre Roche and ceramic tiles by Alexandre Bigot, who tiles were used in the facades of many Art Nouveau buildings. The open interior with its iron columns and arches was a strikingly modern.

Furniture - Hector Guimard and the Nancy School  Furniture was another important domain of the Art Nouveau. In some cases the architects themselves designed the furniture to match the exterior and interior decoration of the house, based on sinuous and curving lines and other forms based upon nature. This was the case of the H√¥tel Guimard, the residence of Hector Guimard. The objective of both architects and furniture designers was to create a style which was different from the predominant neoclassical and Beaux-Arts styles which were dominant before Art Nouveau. Sometimes the Art Nouveau furniture and other decorative objects resembled the Rocaille or Rococo style of the reign of Louis XV, with its curving floral and vegetal designs, particularly in table legs, drawer handles and other ornament. The weakness of the Art Nouveau furniture style was that, since the furniture matched the decoration and architecture of the room, the furniture could not be changed or added to without disrupting the harmony of the room. This was one reason why the popularity of Art Nouveau decoration was short-lived. Louis Majorelle was another major figure in Art Nouveau furniture design. His house and workshops were in Nancy in Lorraine, but he also had a large residence and showroom in Paris, and he was a leading participant in all of the major expositions and salons of the period. Majorelle's furniture pieces were hand-made individually, rarely in a series, and used expensive and exotic materials. The Cabinet by Louis Majorelle illustrated in the gallery below, from about 1900‚Äì1910, (now in the Dallas Museum of Art) is crafted of mahogany, oak and walnut, with inlays of exotic hardwoods. combined with handles and other decoration of bronze. Eug√®ne Vallin was another important figure in Art Nouveau furniture. Like Majorelle, his workshop was in Nancy, and he and Majorelle were founders of the √âcole de Nancy, a group of artisans who created the distinctive Nancy style of art Nouveau, which became popular in Paris. In the second part of the Art Nouveau period, from 1900 until 1914, Majorelle and most of the members of the Nancy School modified the Art Nouveau style, making it less ornate, with cleaner lines and simpler forms, File:Side Chair, 1900, Hector Guimard.jpgSide chair by Hector Guimard (1900) (Art Institute of Chicago) File:Hector Guimard (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon) (11251879956).jpgBedroom furniture of the H√¥tel Guimard by Hector Guimard (now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon) File:Guimard-ChaiseLongue.jpgChaise Lonngue by Hector Guimard in the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris (c. 1903) File:Majorelle-Desk.jpgDesk by Louis Majorelle (1903‚Äì04), at the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris.

That city was the home of the workshops of √âmile Gall√© and of the Daum Studio, and had a large number of skilled craftsmen. Daum specialized in lead glass or crystal, which it made by a traditional Glass casting process. Art Nouveau glassware preceded Art Nouveau in other media; floral vases and cups bu the Daum Studio were displayed as early as the 1889 Paris Exposition. The glassware from Nancy was one of the major features at the 1900 Paris Exposition. It predominantly featured the same motifs as the furniture and other media; flowing lines and floral designs, with rich colors. The Daum process often involved modeling the glass while it was hot, and adding polychrome powdered enamels which vitrified on the surface. The handle was molded and added while it was hot.

Ceramic tiles and decoration were featured on the facades of buildings, and appeared as works of sculpture. A major ceramics workshop had been founded in Paris by the Alsacian Th√©odore Deck in the 1870s. He began to create works based on floral patterns and Japanese designs and techniques. Technical developments advanced under his pupil, Edmond Lachenal, who used bright polychrome glazes. Other important figures in ceramic arts included Auguste Delaherche, Cl√©ment Massier, and Jean Carri√®s.Fahr-Becker (2015) pp. 98‚Äì99 The ceramics manufacturer Alexandre Bigot was a major figure in Paris ceramics. His pavilion at the Exposition Universelle (1900) was entirely covered in ceramic sculpture on classical and Art Nouveau themes, including bicycles. The Pavilion was demolished at the end of the Exposition, but many of the decorations were preserved. His ceramics also lavishly covered the facades of the Paris houses designed by Jules Lavirotte.

One of the most versatile artists was the painter and bronze sculptor Georges de Feure. Born in Belgium, he moved to Paris, and became a lead designer for Art Nouveau gallery owner Siegfried Bing. Besides metal work, He designed furniture, wrote for newspapers, and created stage sets and posters for the Le Chat Noir cabaret. His work was featured at the Exposition Universelle de Paris, and in 1901 he was named a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur for his contribution to the decorative arts. Examples of his work can be found at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris.Ian Millman Georges de Feure : ma√Ætre du symbolisme et de l'Art nouveau, A.C.R.

One classic example is the Cascade Pendant designed by Alfons Mucha and made by Fouquet, now on display at the Petit Palais. It represents a cascade of opals, diamonds and slightly misshapen, or \\"Barocco\\", pearls, along with gold and enamel. He used opals because of their delicate pale color and misshapen pearls to offer unusual but more natural forms. He also employed circles of tiny diamonds around larger stones to frame and highlight them. The interior of his jewelry shop, designed by Mucha, is now on display at the Carnavalet Museum.Text on Art Nouveau jewelry display at Petit Palais, Paris The Fouquet firm, headed by Georges Fouquet, and its jewelers borrowed from many different periods and styles. Most subjects for jewelers were taken from the natural world, including peacocks, butterflies and dragonflies, and flowers. Others were drawn from mythology, or figures of mermaids, themes, butterflies, and mermaids, they also sometimes drew inspiration from the art of Ancient Egypt, China and Japan.Fahr-Becker, Gabriel (2015), L'Art Nouveau, pp. 87-89 One distinctive feature of Art Nouveau jewelry was that the value of the piece did not depend primarily upon the value of the precious jewels or gold used, as in traditional jewelry. Many of the materials used were semiprecious and oddly- shaped stones and pearls. The value was determined by the imagination and the reputation of the designer. Mucha and other Art Nouveau illustrators often collaborated with jewelers, Eug√®ne Grasset, best known for his theatrical posters and magazine illustrations, made designs for objects ranging from combs to belt buckles created by Paris jewelers. Ren√© Lalique, best known for glass art, was also a major figure in Paris Art Nouveau jewelry design. Like Fouquet, he combined more traditional materials, such as diamonds and emeralds, with semi-precious stones, amber, ivory, pearls, enamels, horn and other natural materials to create original and imaginative forms. He also used cabochons, which were convex, polished gemstones, rounded rather than faceted. He particularly created diadems and pendants in the form os plants, insects, and mythical figures. Louis Aucoc and his family firm, where Lalique had been an apprentice, was another important creator of Art Nouveau jewelry. Other notable jewelry creators included Lucien Gaillard, Paul Follot, and Paul and Henri Vever.

They were made possible by the invention of color lithography in 1879, and further improvements which permitted more colors and mass production of better quality images. The subjects of posters were almost always women, whose long, curling hair became a central element of the design, often combined with flowers and vegetal designs.Fahr-Becker, Gabriele, L'Art Nouveau (2015), pp. 91‚Äì93 Paris in the 1890s was covered with colorful Art Nouveau posters selling bicycles, beverages, medicines, voyages to the South of France, all with the same spirit of movement and gaiety. Alfons Mucha was the best-known of the poster designers, particularly for the theatrical posters he created for actress Sarah Bernhardt, beginning with a memorable poster for her starring role as Gismonda in 1895, Mucha also designed sets and costumes for Bernhardt, as well as jewelry. Bernhardt herself recognized the value of his posters as art objects, and reserved a certain number of posters for sale to collectors. The skirts and costumes of dancers, flying into billowing forms, were another popular motif, used in the early Art Nouveau by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and by Jules Ch√©ret, depicted the dancer Loie Fuller surrounded by a cloud of whirling fabric. Other important early figures in the genre included Eug√®ne Grasset, who taught at the major schools of graphic arts and design in Paris, and who published books of images in the new style, and Jules Ch√©ret, who became famous for his posters of actresses and dancers in twisting Baroque poses.

Most of the major painters of the period, such as Renoir and Monet were considered exclusively studio artists in other schools. However, some painters specifically made work in an Art Nouveau style, specifically for decoration. The best known painters in this category were the members of Les Nabis. Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and the other Nabis often made decorative paintings tailored to particular rooms or settings. They were often inspired by Japanese panel paintings, which had become very popular in Paris during the period, largely through the efforts of Siegfried Bing and his Maison de l'Art Nouveau beginning in 1895. As with other forms of Art Nouveau, the subjects painted were very often women in floral settings. The floral patterns were sometimes in gardens or sometimes on the walls, and were often very stylized and abstract, with a strong Japanese influence.Lacambre, Genevi√®ve, La d√©ferlante japonaise, published in Les Nabis et le d√©cor, Beaux Arts Editions (March 2019), pp. 38-40 In some cases, the artists created murals; At the end of the Art Nouveau period, Maurice Denis painted an Art Nouveau mural on the interior of the upola of the new Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris (1908‚Äì11) File:Femmes au jardin.gifPierre Bonnard, Women in the Garden (1890‚Äì91), in the Japanese kamemono style File:Soir de septembre-Maurice Denis-IMG 8192.JPGMaurice Denis, Evening in September (1891) File:MauriceDenis-LEchelleDansLeFeuillage.JPGThe Ladder in the foliage by Maurice Denis (1892), canvas on a wood panel, made for the ceiling of the home of art patron Henry Lerolle.

The aim of the operation was to tie down German reserves during the Battle of Kursk and overrun the German forces located in Donbass. Soviet troops managed to cross the Seversky Donets river and seize the bridgehead, but the German counterattacks stopped the further advance. Background The Soviet command believed that German troops on the southern section of the Eastern Front were greatly weakened. There were no tank divisions left in the 1st Panzer Army in this sector (for example, in the XL Panzer Corps there were only three ordinary infantry divisions). Only one tank battalion remained in the reserve 17th Panzer Division. So, the South- Western Front was supposed to strike three Guards Armies (1st and 8th in the main direction and the 3rd in the auxiliary) and to break the German defenses. After that, the Soviet tank formations (23rd Tank Corps and 1st Guards Mechanized Corps) were to enter the breakthrough. In the Stalino region they were to connect with the troops of the Southern Front and, thus, encircle German troops in Donbass. Compensating for the lack of tanks, German troops relied on their fortifications created since March 1943. In addition, Soviet intelligence seriously underestimated the strength of opposed infantry divisions (especially their equipment with artillery and machine guns). The Southwestern Front did not have a numerical superiority over the 1st Panzer Army, but it included many experienced Guards units. Indeed, the 8th Guards Army (then 62nd Army) excelled during the defense of Stalingrad. Orders of battle Two armies of the Soviet Southwestern Front (6th and 57th) were not involved in the operation. Also, 6th Army, 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf of German Army Group South were not involved. The 23rd Panzer Division of XXIV Panzer Corps was sent towards Mius river.

The Soviet offensive began on July 17. The 1st and 8th Guards Armies managed to cross the Seversky Donets River, capture new bridgeheads on the right bank and advance to a depth up to 5 kilometers. However, the advance stopped there, because Soviet troops were unable to crack the defense system completely and so the tank units could not operate freely in a greater depth. The German command quickly used at first the reserves of the 1st Panzer Army and then the XXIV Panzer Corps. Attacks of the 3rd Guards Army in the auxiliary direction were completely unsuccessful. In the following days there was a fierce head-on battle. The German units launched counterattacks, trying to liquidate the Soviet bridgeheads. They did not achieve full success, but suppressed the Soviet troops and completely ruled out the possibility of an operational breakthrough. Both sides suffered serious losses. So, the 17th Panzer Division in a few days lost 91 officers and 2,446 soldiers, Generalleutnant Walter Schilling was killed. Opposing them, the 79th Guards Rifle Division lost 4,681 people and the division commander Batyuk died of a heart attack soon after the end of the operation. Military historian Ziemke said about Izyum-Barvenkovo Offensive along with the Mius Offensive: \\"Those were small battles, like so many others quickly lost in the rush of greater events, but, nevertheless, enormously costly for both sides.\\" Results Soviet troops failed to realize the plan of the offensive, the German troops in Donbas avoid encirclement and defeat. Soviet historiography claims that the operation shackled the German reserves necessary for the Battle of Kursk.

Before the arrival of Spanish colonial powers the Philippines did not actually exist. Southeast Asia is classified as part of the Indosphere and the Sinosphere. The archipelago has direct contact with China during Song dynasty (960-1279) and has been a part of the Srivijaya and Majapahit empires. Overview Historiography of the Philippines refers to the studies, sources, critical methods and interpretations used by scholars to study the history of the Philippines. The Philippine archipelago has been part of many empires before the Spanish empire has arrived in the 16th century. The pre-colonial Philippines uses the Abugida writing system that has been widely used in writing and seals on documents though it was for communication and no recorded writings of early literature or history Ancient Filipinos usually write documents on bamboo, bark, and leaves which did not survive unlike inscriptions on clays, metals, and ivories did like the Laguna Copperplate Inscription and Butuan Ivory Seal. The discovery of the Butuan Ivory Seal also proves the use of paper documents in ancient Philippines. The arrival of the Spanish colonizers, pre-colonial Filipino manuscripts and documents were gathered and burned to eliminate pagan beliefs. This has been the burden of historians in the accumulation of data and the development of theories that gave historians many aspects of Philippine history that were left unexplained. The interplay of pre-colonial events, the use of secondary sources written by historians to evaluate the primary sources, do not provide a critical examination of the methodology of the early Philippine historical study. Organizations Scholarly organizations and societies have been formed which usually hold conferences, publish journals and promote historical knowledge and studies. =Government agency= The National Historical Commission of the Philippines is a government agency of the Philippines whose mission is \\"the promotion of Philippine history and cultural heritage through research, dissemination, conservation, sites management and heraldry works and aims to inculcate awareness and appreciation of the noble deeds and ideals of our heroes and other illustrious Filipinos, to instill pride in the Filipino people and to rekindle the Filipino spirit through the lessons of history. =Professional association= The Philippine Historical Association is the largest professional association of historians in the Philippines founded in 1955 by a group of prominent Filipino historians which includes Encarnacion Alzona, Gabriel Fabella, Gregorio Zaide, Nicolas Zafra, Celedonio Resurreccion, Teodoro Agoncillo and Esteban de Ocampo. =Non-governmental organization= The Philippine Association for the Study of Culture, History and Religion is a Non-governmental organization founded in 2013. This group initiates, facilitates, and organizes conferences and other academic events.

Ma-i, an ancient sovereign state located in what is now the Philippines is notable in the history of the Philippines for being the first place in the archipelago ever to be mentioned in any foreign account which was first documented in 971 AD, in the Song dynasty documents known as the History of Song. Its existence was also mentioned in the 10th-century records of the Sultanate of Brunei. Until the year 1000 CE, maritime societies exists in the archipelago but there was no significant political state unifying the entire Philippines. The region included only numerous small administrative divisions (ranging in size from villages to city-states) under the sovereignty of competing thalassocracies ruled by datus, rajahs, sultans or lakans.http://ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/asp/article/view/5493/4927 Victor Estella, The Death of Gold in Early Visayan Societies: Ethnohistoric Accounts and Archaeological Evidences. Colonial period The first recorded document that mentions the archipelago was Antonio Pigafetta's chronicle Report of the first trip around the world on his narrative record of the journey of a Spanish expedition in search of the Spice Islands published sometimes between 1524-1525. Another notable document was Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas published in 1609 based on the author's personal experience and documentations from eye-witnesses of the survivors of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi's expedition. Documents published are chronicles by the early Spanish explorers and navigators and religious records of Spanish friars of their Catholic mission during the Spanish colonial period. =Early chroniclers= Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas Boxer Codex Illustrations of tattooed Cebuanos * Antonio Pigafetta * Rodrigo de Aganduru Moriz * Hernando de Riquel * Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi * Juan de Plasencia * Pedro de San Buenaventura * Pedro Chirino =Colonial Era Historians= * Antonio de Morga * Emma Helen Blair and James A.

The critical role played by the Filipinos in shaping the Philippine national history in this period is well highlighted and analyzed based on the accounts on the revolution and the Philippine-American War as it describes the social, economic, political, and cultural conditions of the Philippines.

It became evident that the protests were unlikely to end soon, and that they posed the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since his ascension to power in 2012. In order to bring the situation under control, Chief Executive Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era powers to impose an anti-mask law, aimed at preventing protesters from hiding their identity. Observers considered the law, which came into force on 4 October, as a precedent for possible wider use of emergency powers at the expense of citizens' freedoms and in addition democratic rights, as they even saw the possibility of the upcoming District Council elections being cancelled based on the emergency law. The mask ban did, however, not achieve the desired effect, but rather proved a further focal point of protests. In November, the High Court ruled the mask ban to be unconstitutional, although in April 2020, an Appeal Court ruled that it was constitutional in the case of unlawful assemblies. The month began with major protests in several parts of the city on occasion of the Chinese National Day. On that day, for the first time in the protests, a protester was shot by police; he was critically injured in the torso, but survived. Police defended this use of potentially lethal force against accusations that it had been disproportionate. Another act of violence that stood out was the slashing of a police officer on 13 October. On 6 October, a taxi driver caused serious leg injuries to a woman when he drove into a crowd of protesters, an act which was seen by protesters as deliberate. On the same day, there was a first confrontation of protesters with the Chinese People's Liberation Army when protesters targeted their Kowloon Tong barracks with laser lights and were shown warnings from inside in response.  Events  = 1 October National Day protests = On the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong protesters marked a \\"national day of mourning\\". In defiance of a police ban on the annual march that the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) applied for, four veteran democrats led a rally from Causeway Bay to Central, mourning the victims of Chinese Communist Party rule and calling for the end of one-party rule in mainland China. Simultaneously, protesters held rallies in Wong Tai Sin, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin and Sham Shui Po, which drew tens of thousands of participants altogether. The protests were initially peaceful, but violent incidents occurred later during the day. MTR stations and businesses that were thought to be associated with the mainland were vandalized. Officers had fired multiple warning shots in locations such as Yau Ma Tei and Wong Tai Sin. In Tsuen Wan, a police officer fired a live round at Tsang Chi-kin, an 18-year- old male secondary school student, to his chest at point blank range with a revolver. This incident happened as the man was assaulting the police officer who ran in to retrieve a fellow officer chased and beaten to the ground by a crowd of protesters. Before being shot, the student was holding a white pipe and a kickboard; when collecting evidence after the shooting, the police took away his mask, his helmet, his kickboard along with a metal rod found from nearby, but without his white pipe. It was the first live round fired at a person by the Hong Kong police in this series of protests. The protester was taken to the emergency room of Princess Margaret Hospital and in critical condition. The Hong Kong Police called the shooting \\"heartbreaking\\" and added that \\"[t]he police officers' lives were seriously threatened. To save his own and his colleagues' lives, [the officer] fired a live shot at the attacker.\\" The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Dominic Raab said in a statement that \\"the use of live ammunition is disproportionate\\". Human rights organization Amnesty International urged \\"the Hong Kong authorities to urgently review their approach in policing the protests to de-escalate the situation and prevent more lives being put at risk\\" and reiterated its call for an independent investigation. Away from the city's protest scenes, the profane phrase \\"Celebrate His Mom\\" („ÄåË≥Ä‰Ω¢ËÄÅÊØç„Äç) showed up in the form of a massive, black vertical protest banner on Devil's Peak. At the same time, Hong Kong citizens crowdfunded to buy whole-page newspaper advertisements on over nine newspapers in different countries to \\"showcase\\" this phrase globally. The countries included South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Argentina, and Mexico.

Protests continued after Tsang was shot by the police. The students and the alumni of his secondary school Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College rallied outside the campus to show their support for Tsang, who was charged with rioting and assaulting officers while still in hospital. About 250 demonstrators gathered at West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts to support him and other protesters who were arrested. In the afternoon, protesters and office workers gathered in Central, Hong Kong and briefly occupied Connaught Road Central. They shouted slogans to condemn the Hong Kong police, such as \\"Hong Kong police intentionally commit murder\\" and \\"disband the police force now\\". Protesters also showed up in Tsuen Wan, where they damaged a mahjong house said to have links to triad groups and started a fire near New Territories South Regional Police Headquarters. Protesters also briefly occupied roads and thoroughfares in Wong Tai Sin and Causeway Bay. In Tuen Mun, Tai Wai and Tseung Kwan O, protesters vandalised several MTR stations. Railway operator MTR Corporation became a target of vandalism after it was accused of cooperating with the police and closing its stations before major protests took place. =3 October protests against anti-mask law = On 3 October, protesters gathered at 11 shopping malls throughout Hong Kong, including New Town Plaza, Yoho Mall and APM to protest against the anti-mask law. The gathering in Cityplaza near Tai Koo station escalated into intense conflicts between protesters and the police, which used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters. At 10:20 pm, the MTR announced that it would close the Kwun Tong station, in response to which protesters nearby damaged its facilities. The MTR then announced the imminent closure of Tai Po Market station, Ngau Tau Kok station and Tai Koo station. = 4-6 October protests against the emergency law = 4 October After Carrie Lam invoked the controversial Emergency Regulations Ordinance to impose a law which bans the wearing of face masks in public gatherings, many protesters defied the new law and wore face masks to show their discontent. Protesters first showed up in Central, Hong Kong and chanted slogans, such as \\"Hong Kong people, resist\\". After the government announced the enactment of the law, which would be effective the following midnight, many universities cancelled their afternoon classes and many malls closed early. The protesters became more radical at night and showed up in various districts in Hong Kong. Protesters occupied Harcourt Road, Nathan Road, Lung Cheung Road and other major thoroughfares. They also damaged facilitates in several railway stations and Light Rail stations, causing the MTR to suspend all of its train services that day. Pro- Beijing shops and corporations thought to have ties to Mainland China, such as Bank of China and Maxim's Catering, were vandalised. The riot police confronted the protesters in Aberdeen and fired the first tear gas canister in the Southern District. In Yuen Long, an off-duty officer was cornered and assaulted by the protesters after being suspected of bumping into protesters in his car. During the altercation, he shot a teenage boy with live ammunition in his left thigh, and then was further assaulted by protesters, having petrol bombs thrown at him. The police issued a statement saying that the officer acted in self-defence. The boy was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital. After midnight, riot police officers with full gear entered the hospital. Hospital Authority expressed concerns regarding the police's presence in the hospital because its staff and patients feared that they might obstruct the hospital's operations. The following day, many MTR stations, banks, and shops remained closed. Lam said that the law was invoked only to quell the violence and insisted that Hong Kong was not in a state of emergency, despite the use of the emergency regulations ordinance. Reuters described the introduction of the anti-mask law as \\"counterproductive or even inflammatory\\", while Vox opined that the new law might further infuriate the protesters.

File:2019-10-04 Protests in Hong Kong 16.jpgAn MTR station vandalised by protesters.  5 October  Protesters staged demonstrations in various districts across the city, setting barricades on main thoroughfares and blocking traffic. Dozens of protesters occupied Castle Peak Road in Yuen Long, singing and chanting anti- government slogans. Several dozen protesters also blocked Lung Cheung Road at Wong Tai Sin, throwing ‚Äúhell money‚Äù and disrupting traffic at some point. Meanwhile, barricades were put up on Nathan Road in Mong Kok, with protesters also surrounding the Mong Kok police station and hurling abuses. A very large group of people, which some reports said numbered in thousands, started a defiant march in Causeway Bay to express their opposition to the government‚Äôs introduction of the anti-mask law. Many of the protesters were wearing face masks, an act that had become illegal as per the emergency laws. Several hundred masked protesters formed a human chain and moved from Tsim Sha Tsui to Sham Shui Po, also in a demonstration against the government's new anti-face mask law. 6 October Protesters marched on the streets of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon on 6 October to protest Lam's decision to invoke the emergency law. Protesters continued to wear different types of face masks in defiance of the anti-mask law. The march was largely peaceful until the police confronted the protesters and began shooting tear gas canisters. Hardline protesters began hurling objects and petrol bombs at the police while the latter deployed water cannons to disperse protesters. A RTHK reporter caught fire and suffered burns to his face after being hit by a Molotov cocktail in Wan Chai. RTHK condemned the use of violence and called all parties to show restraint. In an escalation of conflict in Sham Shui Po district in Kowloon, a taxi under attack from some protesters, inadvertently rammed into a crowd and severely injured a female protester. The driver, who was pulled out of the cab and immediately surrounded by a large crowd and badly beaten, was admitted to hospital with several rib fractures. The driver said he had lost HK$20,000 ($2,550) in cash and a watch valued at HK$140,000 during the course of the incident; his taxi was also damaged. Police classified the case as ‚Äúrioting, wounding, criminal damage, theft, and traffic accident causing injury‚Äù. Protesters accused the taxi driver of deliberately ramming his car into the crowd of protesters. Actress Celine Ma was attacked by protesters after she filmed the protesters vandalising a Bank of China ATM in Mong Kok with her phone and provoked the protesters by attempting to punch and kick one of them. In Kowloon Tong, police arrested several students and entered the Hong Kong Baptist University campus without permission. At night, the garrison of People's Liberation Army raised a warning flag against the protesters who were shining laser light on the exteriors of the garrison building, marking the first military response during the protest.

The security guards were later charged by the police for obstruction. On 8 October, protesters gathered inside the shopping mall MOSTown to sing several protest songs such as \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\". However, after some protesters vandalised the Ma On Shan station, a group of riot police stormed the plaza. A group of security guards attempted to guard the door to prevent their entry as the mall is a private area. During the storming, a reporter from Stand News who was live streaming was attacked by the police, who pepper- sprayed her, removed her glasses and took her charging cable. Disgruntled protesters later briefly protested outside Ma On Shan police station. Around the same time, protesters continued to confront with the police in various locations including Whampoa Garden, Mong Kok near Prince Edward station, Tai Po, and Tseung Kwan O, where a bicycle was thrown to a police officer who suffered injuries and was hospitalised. =9 October solidarity rally for Edward Leung= Hundreds of supporters of jailed pro-independence activist Edward Leung gathered outside Hong Kong's Court of Appeal and queued as early as sunrise to get a seat in the public gallery. Leung was jailed due to his involvement in the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest and had launched an appeal against his six-year prison sentence. Supporters chanted the slogan \\"liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\", which was Leung's campaign slogan during the 2016 New Territories East by-election. = 10 October march = Dozens of people held a protest outside the Tsim Sha Tsui police station to mark World Sight Day by showing their support for a woman who suffered a serious eye injury during an anti-government protest on August 11. Protesters ‚Äì many of them wearing masks in defiance of a new ban implemented last Saturday ‚Äì chanted protest slogans and held up signs saying ‚Äòfive demands, not one less.‚Äô On the other hand, a pair of black vertical protest banners, a couplet, was hung at the main entrance of Hong Kong University accusing the university officials for not speaking up against police brutality, and for not defending Hong Kong freedom. The couplet should read from right to left: \\"Watching From The Sideline You Ruin Hong Kong's Future. Turning a Blind Eye You Consent to Tyranny's Murders\\" („Äå‰Ω†ÂÜ∑ÁúºÊóÅËßÄË¶™ÊâãÊñ∑ÈÄÅÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊú™‰æÜ„Äç „Äå‰Ω†Ë¶ñËÄå‰∏çË¶ãÊ∑™ÁÇ∫ÊÆ∫‰∫∫ÊîøÊ¨äÂπ´ÂÖá„Äç). =12 October march= Over a thousand protesters marched in an unauthorized protest from Tsim Sha Tsui to Sham Shui Po to protest against the government's decision to invoke the emergency law. Protesters wore face masks in defiance of the anti-mask law. The march was largely peaceful with little police presence. =13 October citywide conflicts= Protesters confronted with the police after flashmobs of protesters showed up in various districts in Hong Kong including Mong Kok, Tseung Kwan O, Tsuen Wan, Kowloon Bay, Sha Tin and Tai Po. The flashmob strategy was used to avoid arrest as railway operator MTR Corporation was accused of cooperating with the police to arrest protesters. Protesters continued to vandalize MTR stations, and sprayed graffiti on Chinese companies and pro-Beijing corporations. The police deployed tear gas to disperse the protesters in various districts. In Kwun Tong, a protester slashed the neck of a police sergeant from behind with a box cutter. The officer, at the time, was handling a criminal damage case at Kwun Tong MTR station. He suffered a 5 cm deep neck wound that severed a jugular vein and vocal cord from the protester's attack. He was transported to United Christian Hospital in serious condition. Two people were arrested at the scene, including the suspected assailant. The suspect, an 18-year-old student, was later charged with wounding a uniformed police officer with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, which carries the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The injured officer continued to be doxed after the attack, with the senior public prosecutor Vincent Lee Ting-wai disclosing that the prosecution would apply for a gag order to ensure the injured officer's anonymity out of safety concerns. A homemade remote-controlled bomb was detonated, as told by the police, with the intention to kill or harm police officers. The explosion was set off near police officers who were clearing a roadblock built by protesters at the intersection between Fife Street and Nathan Road in Mong Kok. There were no casualties reported. = 14 October marches = 14 October protest at Hong Kong Design Institute Chan Yin-lam, an avid swimmer and a protester, was declared dead in late September after her corpse was found floating naked in the sea near Yau Tong. Police claimed that after investigations, there had been nothing suspicious about the circumstances of Chan's death, which they considered to be a suicide, though many refused to trust the police. Students from Youth College and Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) Tiu King Leng campus gathered to demand the campus management to release the CCTV footage on the evening of 19 September, where Chan was last seen before her death. Campus management only released partial footage, causing disgruntled students to vandalize the glass panels of the campus. The Vocational Training Council later released additional CCTV clips after 200 students, amid class suspension, rallied inside the campus to support an online appeal for an indefinite class boycott. However, in a new development to clarify the death, the mother of the student believed her daughter committed suicide. 14 October rally for the Human Rights and Democracy Act Protesters gathered in Chater Garden, waving the American flag, and \\"Free HK\\" banners. A rally, using the slogan \\"Fight with Hong Kong, justice to our victims,\\" was held at night on 14 October at Chater Garden, calling on the United States to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which would sanction officials for undermining autonomy in Hong Kong. Organiser Ventus Lau received a Letter of No Objection from the police, making this the first protest with police approval since the emergency law was invoked. The rally began at 7 pm. Crowds split from the public park and onto adjacent roads, turned on their phone flashlights, and chanted protest slogans, such as \\"Hongkongers, resist\\" as they marched along with a massive vertical protest banner. The crowd sang protest songs including \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\". The event saw speeches from several figures including activist Joshua Wong and politician Au Nok-hin. Organisers announced that more than 130,000 people took part in the rally. The government issued a statement saying that it regretted the assembly and criticised any foreign interference into the \\"internal affairs\\" of Hong Kong. = 15 October basketball march = Dozens of basketball fans took to Southorn Playground in Wan Chai to show their support for Daryl Morey and expressed their disdain for superstar Lebron James, after both had stirred up controversy with their comments about the protests. =18 October human chain= During the night of 18 October, protesters organised a human chain protest against the anti-mask law. Some protesters distributed masks to other participants, while some chanted slogans such as \\"five demands, not one less\\". Many protesters wore surgical masks to conceal their identity, though some also donned photographic masks of Carrie Lam, Xi Jinping, Winnie the Pooh and Guy Fawkes. =20 October Kowloon protest= The moment that the Police's water cannon attacked Kowloon Mosque on 20 October 2019. Around 10 followers and citizens were outside the Mosque. Following a police ban on a protest applied by the Civil Human Rights Front and the attack on CHRF convenor Jimmy Sham, protesters marched from Tsim Sha Tsui to the West Kowloon station to protest against the government's decision to invoke the emergency law and condemn police brutality. The peaceful protest was led by Figo Chan, the vice-convener of CHRF alongside former lawmakers including Albert Ho and Leung Kwok-hung, though some protesters splintered off to Nathan Road and it soon escalated into confrontations between the protesters and the police. The protesters continued to target MTR stations, Mainland Chinese-funded stores and Best Mart 360, which was accused of having ties to Fujianese triads, and hurled objects and petrol bombs at the police, whereas the police fired numerous tear gas canisters and deployed water cannon trucks. The conflict soon spread to other districts including Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po. Chan claimed that 350,000 people joined the march. After Sham was attacked by a group of suspected South Asians, pro-protest members of ethnic minorities showed their solidarity with the protesters by distributing cold water to them at the entrance of Chungking Mansions, while some local protesters guarded the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre, demanding passers-by not to vandalize the mosque out of retaliation. Before the protest, Sham had issued a statement, saying \\"Let us connect with and protect each other. Do not label anyone by ethnicity in the movement. I believe that everyone who joins this path to democracy are our brothers and sisters, regardless of nationality, language, color and race\\". However, the police's clearance action, which saw blue-dyed water being sprayed on the gates of the mosque, led to condemnation from CHRF and the Muslim community in Hong Kong. Volunteers arrived an hour later to help clean the gate, while the police issued a statement saying that the mosque had not been its intended target and apologized to the mosque. Carrie Lam later followed up with an official apology. Former Indian Association of Hong Kong president Mohan Chugani, who was sprayed outside the mosque alongside lawmaker Jeremy Tam and businessman Phillip Khan, refused to accept Lam's apology, while Khan believed that the police intentionally sprayed the mosque and that the act was an \\"insult to the Islamic religion\\". = 21 October vertical protest banner on Devil's Peak = After making its rounds inside various shopping malls in Hong Kong, this 20-meter yellow vertical protest banner has now made its way to Devil's Peak. The words demanded \\"We Long for Glory To Hong Kong\\" („ÄåÊàëÈ°òÊ¶ÆÂÖâÊ≠∏È¶ôÊ∏Ø„Äç). =24 October solidarity rally for the Catalan protests= The rally was initiated by Chow Shue Fung, the former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Student Union, and Ventus Lau to support the protesters in the 2019 Catalan protests. The organizers said that the number of gatherings exceeded 3,000 people. Hong Kong protests have been cited as an inspiration by the Catalan protesters for its \\"leaderless\\" model. A solidarity rally for the Hong Kong protests was held outside the Chinese Consulate-General in Barcelona on the same day. = 25 October human chain = Hundreds of people formed a human chain in Tseung Kwan O saying they still believe the death of a 15-year-old student in the area is suspicious. Hong Kong Design Institute student Chan Yin-lam was last seen on the school‚Äôs campus in Tiu Keng Leng on September 19. Her body was found in the sea off Tseung Kwan O three days later. =26 October rally by medical professionals= A peaceful rally of hundreds of medical professionals was conducted in a park in central Hong Kong. They protested against alleged violence employed by police against protesters, and also police arresting medical professionals working on the front-lines of the protests. =27 October Tsim Sha Tsui protest= An unauthorized protest was conducted in the afternoon near the Peninsula luxury hotel. Police were already present, and within minutes of the start of the protest, tear gas and pepper spray was employed as the protesters fought with police. This led to people in the Peninsula hotel lobby being affected by the tear gas. At night, police traveled northwards from Tsim Sha Tsui, employing tear gas and water cannons (but without stinging blue dyed water used the previous week). A hill-top vertical protest banner with the words \\"Hong Kong Police Intended Murder\\" („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØË≠¶ÂØüËìÑÊÑèË¨ÄÊÆ∫„Äç) written in Chinese used in earlier protests made its way to its final destination: Beacon Hill, where it was then retrieved by firefighters within hours. =28 October Tuen Mun protest= Many Tuen Mun residents reported an unknown irritating smell, suspected to be tear gas, starting from 4 pm. Smells that resembled that of tear gas were reported near Kin Sang Estate and Shek Pai stop; some people who felt unwell were sent to hospital. Initially, firefighters suspected the smell to be the result of a chlorine leakage from Tuen Mun North West Swimming Pool, though staff at the swimming pool reported no gas leakage. It was later reported that the gas was leaked from Tai Hing Operational Base opposite Kin Sang Estate, though police denied that they had released any gas. In a joint statement, 10 District Council candidates from Tuen Mun condemned police for \\"neglecting the safety of local residents and testing tear gas near residential areas\\", requesting police to explain details of the situation and apologise to Tuen Mun residents. Roy Kwong, a Democratic member of the Legislative Council, said he had sent a letter to the Hong Kong Police Force requesting Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo to explain whether police leaked tear gas or related gases, suspecting that in such a case the health of local residents and animals would be adversely affected. Several hundred people gathered at the Tai Hing Operational Base at night, in response to the irritating smell. Riot police were sent out to confront the crowd. Some protesters chanted slogans and pointed laser pens at officers, whilst police shone bright lights at the protesters. Protesters set up a makeshift roadblock on a street outside the base, threw bricks and a petrol bomb at a Bank of China branch, and damaged the glass door of a Fulum Group restaurant suspected to be sympathetic to gangs which have attacked them. Police responded with tear gas canisters after warning, some of which was fired onto the podium of Blossom Garden, a private housing estate nearby, and some to the seventh floor of Yat Sang House, Siu Hin Court. =30 October Tuen Mun protest= A second protest in response to the suspected tear gas leak occurred at night. More than 70 people, mostly Tuen Mun residents, were arrested. Man Shek Fong-yau, a former police constable who organised several pro-Beijing events, appeared outside the Tai Hing Operational Base at 8:30 pm with around 30 people. The group chanted the slogan \\"Hong Kong cockroaches, the vermin of the times\\", a play on the pro-democracy slogan \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\", and was seen arguing with residents. Residents refused to leave after police raised a blue warning flag stating that they were engaged in an unlawful assembly. Several black-clad protesters began to form roadblocks 20 minutes later. Police ordered residents to kneel down with their hands in the air or behind their backs at the lobby of Yat Sang House, Siu Hin Court. A man and a woman who appeared to taunt the police entered a Japanese restaurant in the area when officers tried to chase them. Two of the restaurant's shopkeepers refused to allow the police to enter the restaurant to arrest the pair. The police then pulled the shopkeepers out of the restaurant and arrested them, then ordered the original suspects to show their identification documents. At around midnight, protesters hurled petrol bombs at the police base, and the police responded by firing three bean bag rounds from inside the base.

It is the eleventh major entry in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, which was first released in 1982, and preceded by Microsoft Flight Simulator X. It was released on August 18, 2020 for Microsoft Windows. It is the first game in the series to also get a console release, expected for the Xbox family in 2021. Flight Simulator simulates the entire Earth using textures and data from Bing Maps. Three-dimensional representations of the world's features, such as terrain, trees, grass, buildings, and water are generated by Microsoft Azure technology. Through the use of the Azure cloud to render visuals, enhance visual fidelity, and simulate real-world data and effects, as well as calculate physics, the title has been viewed as the culmination of Microsoft's \\"power of the cloud\\" mantra. Some players received the alpha version as part of the game's Insider program. On July 13, 2020, Microsoft opened up preorders, and the PC version became available on August 18, 2020. Flight Simulator was released to critical acclaim, with praise for its graphical fidelity, but criticism for its loading times and some inaccurate rendering of landmarks. Many critics considered it a technical achievement.  Overview  Flight Simulator uses Asobo's in-house developed game engine, and leverages Bing Maps data, accessing over two petabytes of data from the cloud on demand. Microsoft partnered up with Blackshark.ai who developed a solution that uses the Microsoft Azure cloud and artificial intelligence that analyzes map data and photogrammetry to generate photorealistic 3D models of buildings, trees, terrain, and so on. This allows the simulator to depict most parts of the world in 3D photorealism, and other parts in high definition. The game's engine utilizes satellite imagery or fly- by image scans as the basis for height and terrain texture data. An offline procedural generation AI then reads these textures based on their own parameters and properly populates terrain with materials, roads, buildings, bushes, trees and more based on brush set assets the developers have made. Afterwards, artists can further go in and embellish specific locations with even more detail with photogrammetrically captured materials and textures. Flight Simulator features multiple terabytes of texture and height map data. Using a base mesh and textures, the game uses the Internet connection to stream even higher quality terrain data onto the PC or console through the Azure cloud as the player plays, boosting the game's fidelity and graphical diversity. Asobo has created their own flight model engine, allowing thousands of surfaces and 3D forces and moments to be fully simulated. There are also realistic physics and weather systems, and utilization of real-world weather data. An example used at E3 2019 was that if it was raining somewhere in real life, it would be raining in-game. Individual clouds will have their own behaviors and they will impact aircraft performance depending on its location within the system. Flight Simulator features a draw distance and allows the player to see storms hundreds of miles away, with lightning cracking inside of clouds. Through cloud-based technology, Flight Simulator streams data to the computer or console in real time, with AI being utilized to extrapolate geometry from a blend of satellite and flyover imagery. Flight Simulator converts 3D scans of the environment into the game world. Other sources of data include terrain data for landscaping, data for foliage density, real-time meteorological data, and air traffic updates. A separate atmospheric renderer simulates accurate humidity and pollution. Microsoft has stated that the player's aircraft feels air as it lifts, drags, or slides as they come in contact with it, accounting for ice on the wings, pollution particles, or how wind moves through buildings or across tree tops, as well as friction of rubber to asphalt when the aircraft touches down, with the aircraft responding accurately to each of these instances. Skyscrapers cast shadows over each other that darken as the player reaches street level and cities will disperse light at night that radiates the sky. Cloud technology is also used to calculate things such as the way air flows around natural structures such as mountains to cause pockets of turbulence, or stream in air traffic, time of day and weather from the real world. In regards to foliage, the game geometrically renders individual blades of grass and seas also contain waves created by the wind. Volumetric lighting is utilized for various effects, including illuminating water droplets, some of which will occupy the entirety of the cockpit window, and with everything being simulated in real time. Light sources such as the Sun, Moon, or city lights scatter through the environment appropriately, pollution levels and humidity affect refraction and overall visibility, and the atmosphere is layered the same as it is in the real world. Clouds are volumetrically modelled, with 32 layers determining shape, density, and ‚Äúfuzziness‚Äù. Flight Simulator makes use of ray-marching. The game's reflection system also at times utilizes ray-marching by retranslating voxels. Otherwise, the reflection system uses a mix of screen-space reflections and cube maps to show reflections on more distant bodies of water. In addition to a complex lighting system, Flight Simulator makes use of highly detailed shaders. Flight Simulator makes extensive use of screen-space reflections and bokeh depth of field. Flight Simulator populates the world with animals and roads with vehicles, water flows realistically based on wind direction, grass has individual grass blades and trees have individual leaves, creating the illusion of a living world. The game world includes over 2 million cities and towns, 1.5 billion buildings, 2 trillion trees, and 37,000 real-world airports. In regards to runways, dedicated tools allow Asobo to outline the site perimeter, runway footprint, orientation, as well as other properties. This approach also allows Microsoft to flag artifacts and visual anomalies from a birds-eye view, clearing up the input for a world-building algorithm. The result is fed into Microsoft's artificial intelligence, stringing the environment together in the cloud, and is streamed to the PC or console in real time. Flight Simulator features various animal species that can even be viewed at ground level, including birds, elephants, giraffes and bears. Flight Simulator allows the player to scout, \\"chase\\" and interact with real-world storms as they occur in real time.  Features  = Aircraft = The standard edition of Flight Simulator includes 20 flyable aircraft, with the deluxe and premium edition also having 5 or 10 additional airplanes, respectively. Most of the aircraft are of US, French, or German origin, with a few coming from Austrian, Czech and Slovenian companies. Aircraft included starting from the Deluxe version include aircraft manufactured by Diamond Aircraft and Textron Aviation Inc., while aircraft exclusively for the Premium Deluxe version include the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner and the Cessna Citation Longitude, as well as several general aviation aircraft. Third-party aircraft will also be supported within the simulator, being directly purchased from the in-game marketplace. Notable confirmed third-party aircraft are the Concorde, developed by DC designs, as well as many other aircraft. The Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network, also known as Vatsim, and The International Virtual Aviation Organisation, also known as IVAO, are online flight- simulation networks confirmed to be supported within Microsoft Flight Simulator. = Airports = Flight Simulator includes around 37,000 manually edited airports from around the world based on real-world satellite images, with the standard, deluxe, and premium edition respectively also including 30, 35, or 40 highly detailed \\"hand-crafted replicas\\" of their real-world counterparts. Airports included starting from the deluxe version include those from the United States, Europe, and Africa, while those exclusively for the Premium Deluxe version include the Heathrow and Dubai Airport, as well as those from the US and Europe.  Development  Flight Simulator was announced at E3 2019 on June 9, 2019. It is the first major entry in the series since 2006's Flight Simulator X, following a long period of uncertainty over the future of the series after the closure of Aces Game Studio in 2009. It was developed by the French Asobo Studio and published by Xbox Game Studios. The game was released on August 18, 2020. The game is powered by Asobo's in-house game engine ACE (Asobo Conception Engine). The franchise's return after a 14-year absence is partially credited to the business model of Xbox Game Pass allowing for a wider variety and diversity of games. In addition, Xbox chief Phil Spencer had also stated that Flight Simulator is part of Microsoft's renewed commitment to PC gaming. According to Spencer: \\"So Sarah Bond, who's our head of global partnerships, came out, did the Game Pass work with the indie montage and all those games that were coming to Game Pass, then announced Xbox Game Pass for PC and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The next games that were there‚ÄîI didn't know if the PC community was going to be watching or not, but we went Flight Sim, we went Age, we went Wasteland‚ÄîI wanted people to know that we want to make sure we're building games and supporting games that respect what the PC community loves.\\" On bringing back Flight Simulator, Spencer stated: \\"We do have some pilots on the teams that are big fans of flight, and flight sims, and flying themselves, who are passionate about it, so we said, 'okay, let's see what we can do'. Flight Sim was a game in our past that sold millions and millions of units and had a very, very passionate community‚Äîin fact, they're still out there. So, okay. Can we do something new with Flight Sim? Can we actually move it forward in an interesting way?\\" Six years prior to release, the foundations for Flight Simulator began through work with Asobo on a product called HoloTour for Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality headset. A challenge that later inspired the Flight Simulator project was to build a digital version of Machu Picchu's vast mountainside and vistas vs. normal buildings at street level. This challenge spurred Microsoft executive and project leader J√∂rg Neumann to consult with the Bing Maps team to use their detailed photogrammetry data, which included the actual ruins of Machu Picchu, in order to create a HoloLens replica of Machu Picchu. Neumann later utilized Bing photogrammetry data to have Asobo build a flight demo for the city of Seattle. Neumann also met with the Swiss company Meteoblue in order to incorporate realistic, real-time and worldwide weather data into the product.https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight- simulator-let-people-fly-hurricane-laura Technology was also incorporated from Microsoft's discontinued Photosynth project, which generates 3D models from 2D photos. In a CNN report on the franchise's history with the flight simming community and current real-world pilots, Neumann stated: In regards to future aspirations for Flight Simulator's technology, according to Neumann:  Release  On July 13, 2020, Microsoft opened up preorders, and announced that Flight Simulator for PC would be available on August 18, 2020. The company announced three different versions of the title ‚Äî Standard, Deluxe, and Premium Deluxe, each providing an incremental set of airplanes to choose and additional airports with more detailed visuals. The pricing ranged from US$59.99 for Standard, to US$89.99 for Deluxe, and US$119.99 for the Premium Deluxe edition. While it is released on the PC, the date for launch on the Xbox family of consoles is awaited. In addition to digital licenses from Microsoft Store and Steam, the game is also available on the PC version of the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. = Retail version = Aerosoft's physical release of the Standard edition came on ten DVDs Aerosoft, a German developer and publisher of simulation software, announced in July 2020 that they have a partnership with Microsoft to release a physical version in Europe. It is available in two editions, Standard and Premium Deluxe (see the features comparison above), and comes with 10 dual-layer DVDs, a printed manual, and a keyboard reference chart. The Premium Deluxe edition also comes with an artbook. The retail version's digital license has to be redeemed on the Microsoft Store. Otherwise there is no difference between the boxed retail and digital versions. The discs contain around 90 GB of data that consists of the installer and basic content, including aircraft and the standard- definition default world. However, the actual simulator software and patches are downloaded during installation; therefore, the game is not playable out of the box. An active internet connection is also needed for the simulator to update itself when needed. As with digital versions, after installation the game does not require an active internet connection and can be played offline; additionally, more details for the world, better ground imagery, as well as real-world weather and air traffic data can optionally be streamed from Microsoft's servers.  Reception  Prior to release, game development and graphics/visual effects industry publication 80 LEVEL described Flight Simulator as \\"one of the most authentic-looking landscape 3D simulations ever in the history of video games,\\" and states that \\"Microsoft is not only changing the face of simulators and aerial simulation, but the way companies actually build games.\\" Polygon's Charlie Hall wrote, \\"It's easily the most magical thing I've ever seen on a computer screen.\\" Eurogamer praised the game for creating \\"one of those rare wow moments that come along once a generation, or that maybe herald the next. This really is a phenomenal thing.\\" LADbible wrote that \\"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 might just be the best-looking video game of all time.\\" According to Paul Sillers, writing for CNN, Flight Simulator might be \\"the safest way to travel\\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, and due to global economic conditions in the wake of COVID-19, is currently being used by furloughed pilots to keep their skills fresh. = Critical response = Microsoft Flight Simulator received \\"universal acclaim\\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 63 reviews, and has been rated the third-best PC game of 2020, behind Half-Life: Alyx and Hades. IGN Seth Macy praised the attention to detail and graphics, and while he criticised the long loading times, he found this unsurprising due to the game's \\"staggering amount of data.\\" In summary, he called it \\"the most incredible experience I've ever had on a computer.\\" PC Gamer Phil Iwaniuk described about the \\"impossible detail of its 1:1 world map\\" and that the \\"simulation model is more detailed than it's ever been.\\" In a review of Flight Simulator, CNN states: \\"Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is truly a marvel when it comes to everything it accomplishes. From the sheer variety of planes, to the destinations you can explore across the globe, to the amount of polish it sports, it‚Äôs clear an abundance of love and care went into making the game a reality,\\" and that \\"If you‚Äôre looking for a game that has a ridiculous amount of content or you‚Äôre even a smidge curious about what it‚Äôs like to fly a plane, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is a must-buy. It‚Äôs an essential buy for anyone who‚Äôs into exquisite detail, fantastic gameplay and those moments that make you marvel over what can be accomplished these days by technology. It‚Äôs a triumphant return for the Flight Simulator series and one of the best titles of 2020 thus far.\\" On Steam, however, many users were frustrated with the long in-game installation forcing them to exceed two hours of gameplay and lose the right to a refund, resulting in a review bomb, several users demanding refunds, and the game's rating dropping to 6 out of 10 stars. (Steam grants refunds on titles only if the user has played the title for less than two cumulative hours.) However, Steam has addressed this issue and has stated that \\"the time it takes your machine to download the additional content will not be counted against the Steam Refund Policy.\\" Some also reported inaccuracies in rendering buildings such as the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. and Buckingham Palace in London, in which its monuments have been misrendered as a skyscraper and an office block respectively. Due to a typographical error in the height of a Melbourne suburban building in OpenStreetMap, data which had been used by Bing Maps and thence used by Asobo, the flight simulator initially rendered a two-storey building as 212 storeys‚Äîinserting an improbably thin and tall skyscraper into the suburb. Some also discovered that the system is unable to render palm trees, making them into obelisks \\"jutting forth from the pavement like so many teeth.\\" The TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, Florida has also been misrendered as an office building with grass roofs. Despite this, Tom Warren of The Verge said that \\"the glitches are more amusing than they are game breaking.\\" Many users on the Flight Simulator support forums also report instability and game crashes without due cause. Writing for the New York Times, Farhad Manjoo stated that \\"the new Flight Sim is more than a technical achievement or a marketing demo. I found it to be most compelling as a preview of a new kind of digital experience. In a way that I have never before felt from a piece of software, the game plunged me into sustained meditations on the permeability between the real world and the online one‚Äîand it offered me some hope of a more realistic kind of online life in the future.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Category:Microsoft Flight Simulator Category:Multiplayer vehicle operation games Category:2020 video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video game sequels Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games ","title":"Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)"},{"id":"61933437","text":"Davsha () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Severo-Baykalsky District, Republic of Buryatia, Russia.

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The river is known for the dramatic evidence of glacial action, which has created large ridges and grooves in the bedrock. A section of the river cascading over these flutes is visible from Quebec Route 138. Location The Sault Plat River leaves Lake Delaunay (length: ) at an elevation of above sea level and flows south from there to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This lake between the mountains is fed in particular by nine discharges of lakes or streams. In particular, it receives the waters of Grace and Boutereau lakes. The mouth of Lac Delaunay is located at: * north-east of downtown Sept-√éles; * north of the mouth of the Sault Plat river; * south-west of the center of the village of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre. From Lake Delaunay, the course of the Sault Plat River descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * to the southeast in a widening of the river on , then crossing the T√™te de Loon lake (length: ; altitude: ) on turning south in the middle of the lake after having bypassed a peninsula attached to the west shore, until its mouth; * towards the south, in particular by crossing Lac Plat (length: ; altitude: ), up to a bend river corresponding to the discharge of a set of lakes (coming from the north-west); * south (slightly east on the first half of the segment), collecting three streams on the east side, descending the mountain in the last to go under the route 138 bridge at the end of the segment, up to its mouth. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Rivi√®re-au- Tonnerre in Minganie Regional County Municipality. The mouth is southwest of the center of village of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre, north-east of down-town of city of Sept-√éles and south-west of the center of the village of Havre-Saint- Pierre. The elongated river basin runs from NNW to SSE with a length of and maximum width of . In addition, 7.9% of the basin is in the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Nipissis in the Sept-Rivi√®res Regional County Municipality. The remainder is in the Minganie Regional County Municipality, divided between the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me (67.5%) and the municipality of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre (24.6%). It is to the west of the Tortue River watershed and to the east of the Bouleau River watershed. Name The river was not named on the maps by Gustave Rinfret (1913) or Edgar Rochette (1927). The name first appeared officially on a map in 1969 in the R√©pertoire g√©ographique du Qu√©bec. The toponym \\"rivi√®re du Sault Plat\\" was made official on December 5, 1968 in the place name bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Rivi√®re du Sault Plat. Terrain The upper part of the Sault Plat watershed is in a piedmont region that falls from an elevation of around in the north down to in the south. The piedmont region has rounded rocky hills, the highest being in elevation. Below the piedmont is a coastal plain wide that falls from an elevationof in the north to an escarpment almost high along the sea. The bedrock is magmatic, mostly an undeformed assembly of granite and pegmatite, with a band of migmatite more than wide that runs from east to west across the center of the watershed. A thin and discontinuous layer of glacial till no more than thick covers the bedrock. On the coastal plain the post-glacial Goldthwait Sea left deep marine clay and silt sediments, later covered by deltaic sandy sediments. A series of huge glacial flutes on the Sault Plat river bed near its mouth are visible from Quebec Route 138. The Quebec government has designated this section of the river as an exceptional geological site (Site g√©ologique exceptionnel). The river cascades through the large flutes and troughs dug out by glaciers during the last ice age, about 18,000 years ago. At one time the ice sheet was thick. As the climate warmed the ice gradually withdrew to central Quebec, where it completely disappeared about 6,500 years ago. The flutes and grooves are elongated in the direction of the ice flow. Hydrology The streams in the Sault Plat basin follow angular courses with straight stretches and sharp bends dictated by fractures in the bedrock. In the widest valleys the streams sometimes meander. The Sault Plat River, counting the section above Lake Delaunay, has a length of and vertical drop of . The annual average flow at its mouth is estimated at , with monthly averages that range from . Lake Delauney, in the center of the watershed, is in an old U-shaped glacial valley. It is long but narrow, covering . In the north of the watershed Lake Boutereau covers and Lake Grace covers . Both are irregular in shape. In total, water bodies cover 12.2% of the basin's area. Wetlands, mainly ombrotrophic bog on the coastal plain, cover 1.63% of the area. Environment The Matamec weather station, west of the Sault Plat River mouth, reports annual average temperature of and annual average rainfall of . A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Forest cover consists of black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), with black spruce dominant on the coastal plain and mixed spruce/fir in the piedmont region. The only recorded fish species is brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Waterfowl congregate on the banks of the south of the river. Reported species at the river mouth by a visitor in August 2019 included double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), northern gannet (Morus bassanus) and various gulls and ducks.

Academy of Arts & Sciences (often shorted to just To the Stars or TTSA) is a company co-founded by Tom DeLonge, guitarist of Blink-182 and Angels & Airwaves; Harold E. Puthoff; and Jim Semivan. The company is composed of aerospace, science, and entertainment divisions. History and funding The company was founded in 2017 as a public benefit corporation by Jim Semivan, a former senior Intelligence Officer with the CIA; Harold E. Puthoff; and Tom DeLonge. The Entertainment Division was created by acquiring DeLonge's previous media company called To the Stars, Inc. The company is based in Las Vegas. In September 2017, the company began offering to the public $50 million worth of stock through a Regulation A+ equity crowdfunding campaign. According to SEC filings, as of October 2018 only $1 million of those shares had been sold and the company had a $37.4 million deficit largely from a stock incentive plan for its employees, prompting Ars Technica and Vice to question the financial sustainability of the company.  Entertainment  The entertainment leg of To the Stars, often referred to as To the Stars Media, publishes albums, books, TV shows and films. \\"To the Stars, Inc.\\", the original company that was folded into the current entity in 2017, was announced in 2014 to be a record label which debuted with Angels & Airwaves' fifth studio album The Dream Walker and DeLonge's first solo album, To the Stars... Demos, Odds and Ends. The following year, it expanded to publishing books and graphic novels with Poet Anderson: ...Of Nightmares and Strange Times: The Curse of Superstition Mountain. To the Stars began releasing books, graphic novels and children's picture books in 2015, many of which were co- published by Simon & Schuster. A majority of the company's books deal with topics of the supernatural, ufology and science fiction. The publishing division of the company most prominently publishes novels in the Sekret Machines fictional series, co-authored by DeLonge and A. J. Hartley, as well as the Sekret Machines non-fiction companion series Gods, Man & War co- authored by DeLonge and Peter Levenda. To the Stars also publishes the space- based series Cathedrals of Glass by Harley, the young adult series Poet Anderson by DeLonge and Suzanne Young, and the young adult adventure series Strange Times by DeLonge and Geoff Herbach. The company co-released the short animated film Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker in 2014, but its first major project was the History Channel series Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation in 2019. A feature film based on the Strange Times book series was in production, but the project was repurposed into a television series for Turner Broadcasting System (TBS). To the Stars has also started production on a documentary TV series and a feature film for the Sekret Machines franchise.  Science and aerospace  The science and aerospace divisions are devoted to the \\"outer edges of science\\" such as investigating unidentified flying objects. Harold E. Puthoff described their goals as \\"imagine having 25th- century science this century.\\" One of the potential projects the company is working on is an \\"electromagnetic vehicle.\\" Vice reported that the company would participate \\"in the investigation of UFOs and other fringe science projects\\" and that \\"many of the technologies or phenomena being researched by the company are based on highly speculative theories that toe the line of pseudoscience\\". To the Stars has detailed the risks involved with this research to potential investors, including possible failure to produce results in areas such as beamed energy propulsion launch systems and telepathy. Some sources have opined that To the Stars is responsible for reinvigorating public imagination of UFOs, including Jan Harzan of Mutual UFO Network and Dan Zak of The Washington Post. For his work at To the Stars, Tom DeLonge was named UFO Researcher of the Year in 2017 by the UFO hunting organization Open Minds. Despite the company's work being primarily associated with ufology, Luis Elizondo has stated: \\"None of us at TTSA consider ourselves ‚ÄòUfologists‚Äô or part of the ‚ÄòUfology culture,‚Äô in fact, most of us come from a U.S. Government background (both Defense and Intelligence).\\" Vice reported that the company's \\"partnership with the U.S. Army may mean that it fancies itself as a military contractor\\", but that the organization \\"swings between being contenders for military contracts and a UFO research organization\\". = The VAULT = The \\"Virtual Analytics UAP Learning Tool\\" (VAULT) is a public-facing database of UFO sightings. The VAULT team collects, analyses and provides their authentication of UFO sightings, most famously reported in the media as having been obtained through declassified government materials. Three videos from the VAULT taken during the USS Nimitz UFO incident and the USS Theodore Roosevelt UFO incidents were publicly confirmed by the US Navy in September 2019 to be authentic videos taken by Navy pilots. The videos were part of a campaign by former intelligence officer Luis Elizondo, who now works for To the Stars, who said that he wanted to shed light on a secretive Department of Defense operation to analyze reported UFO sightings, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. In April of 2020, the same footage released by the company was subsequently declassified and officially released by the Navy. The company, with assistance from Chris Mellon, who worked formerly for the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Department of Defense, engaged congress and arranged classified congressional hearings with the pilots involved in the incidents aimed at understanding the potential threat to aviators. = ADAM Research Project = The company's ADAM Research Project is promoting what they believe to be an \\"extraterrestrial\\" metal for commercial and military applications. In July of 2019 the company stated it had acquired and was studying \\"potentially exotic materials\\" as part of its Acquisition & Data Analysis of Materials (ADAM) research project. Steve Justice, To The Stars's COO and former head of Advanced Systems at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works said in a statement that \\"the structure and composition of these materials are not from any known existing military or commercial application‚Äù and that the materials would be studied in an attempt to reverse engineer them. Regarding the origin of the materials he stated: ‚Äúthey've been collected from sources with varying levels of chain-of-custody documentation, so we are focusing on verifiable facts and working to develop independent scientific proof of the materials' properties and attributes.\\" In its SEC filing, the company is recorded as having paid $35,000 for several items including \\"six pieces of Bismuth/Magnesium-Zinc metal\\" and a piece of aluminum. According to the company, the metals are from an unidentified flying object, and were previously \\"retained and studied\\" by ufologist Linda Moulton Howe. Moulton Howe claimed in 2004 that the metals become a ‚Äúlifting body‚Äù when subjected to electromagnetic radiation. Today, however, she claims she has had the samples tested by Carnegie Science's Department of Technical Magnetism in 1996 and again by Harold E. Puthoff and others on several occasions. According to a letter from Puthoff in 2012 the tests were unable to prove the alien origin of the samples or any \\"interesting/anomalous outcome\\" but suggested that one additional test was remaining that required special equipment which was not readily available. The company has partnered with research labs founded by Puthoff to study the materials further. Critics say there is no evidence to support the claim that the materials are \\"otherworldly in origin\\" or that they may be \\"scientifically important\\". Commenting on similar reports of \\"Alien Alloys\\", American Chemical Society expert panel member Richard Sachleben considers such claims \\"quite impossible\\". According to Sachleben, \\"I don't think it's plausible that there's any alloys that we can't identify\\". May Nyman of Oregon State University Department of Chemistry criticized claims of extensive research to identify an unknown alloy, saying, \\"if we had such mysterious metals, you could take it to any university where research is done, and they could tell you what are the elements and something about the crystalline phase within a few hours.\\" Chris Cogswell, who holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering and hosts the Mad Scientist Podcast, states that ‚Äúthe chances of it being important scientifically are extremely slim\\" and suggested that the Bismuth/Magnesium-Zinc pieces may be slag from an industrial process such as the Betterton-Kroll process. On October 17, 2019 the company announced it entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. The five-year contract will focus on \\"inertial mass reduction, mechanical/structural meta materials, electromagnetic meta material wave guides, quantum physics, quantum communications, and beamed energy propulsion.\\" According to the U.S. Army, no public funding will go the group, but at least $750,000 will be provided in support and resources for developing and testing To the Stars technologies. The contract states that To the Stars will provide samples in its possession of ‚Äúmetamaterials‚Äù, any data or ‚Äúobtained vehicles\\" that use ‚Äúbeamed energy propulsion,‚Äù and any information or technology related to ‚Äúactive camouflage‚Äù for testing and analysis of potential application on Army ground vehicles. Doug Halleaux, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Ground Vehicle Systems Center, has stated that the US government has approached To the Stars since ‚ÄúIf materials represented in the TTSA ADAM project are scientifically evaluated and presented with supporting data as having military utility by the TTSA, it makes sense to look deeper here.‚Äù According to Halleaux, the Army is also interested in the results of a collaboration between To the Stars and TruClear Global, a company that creates custom video screen billboards, aimed at providing \\"advanced technology solutions to United States Government clientele.\\"  Works  = Books and graphic novels = Sekret Machines *Sekret Machines: Book 1 ‚Äì Chasing Shadows (2016) *Sekret Machines: Gods (2017) *Sekret Machines: Book 2 ‚Äì A Fire Within (2018) *Sekret Machines: Man (2019) Cathedrals of Glass *Cathedrals of Glass: A Planet of Blood and Ice (2017) *Cathedrals of Glass: Valkrys Wakes (2020) Poet Anderson *Poet Anderson: ...Of Nightmares (2015) *Poet Anderson: ...In Darkness (2018) Strange Times *Strange Times: The Curse of Superstition Mountain (2015) *Strange Times: The Ghost in the Girl (2016) Other *The Lonely Astronaut on Christmas Eve (re-release) (2016) *Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes?

The photo above depicts Tsuda University in Tsuda-ch≈ç, where Shiina's home was located. Gaku Stories („Åå„Åè„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åå„Åü„Çä Gakumonogatari), also published under the title My Boy: A Father's Memories, is an I Novel by Japanese author Makoto Shiina. It was published in 1985 by Shueisha. The same publisher also published a sequel, Zoku Gakumonogatari, in 1986. The title character, Gaku, is modelled on Shiina's eldest son of the same name. And the story, told from Shiina's point of view as a father, depicts the family's life over the course of Gaku's kindergarten days and the six years of elementary school leading up to his enrolment in lower secondary school. It also addresses Gaku's rebellious phase, and the personal growth and independence he achieves through it. The novel was the first of Shiina's I Novels, and is one of the author's defining works. The novel and its sequel were later edited and rereleased as a single work, Gakumonogatari: Revised Edition (ÂÆöÊú¨ Â≤≥Áâ©Ë™û Teihon Gakumonogatari), which this article also addresses.  Outline and author background  = Gaku Stories = Published in May 1985 by Shueisha. The novel is composed of nine sections: \\"Fragrant Olive\\", \\"Swallowtail Butterfly\\", \\"Indian Trumpet\\", \\"Dandelion\\", \\"Operation Mackerel Scad\\", \\"The Eagle and the Pig\\", \\"Thirty Years\\", \\"Goby Fishing\\", and \\"The Two Day Present\\". A paperback edition of the novel featuring an afterword by Shigeta Sait≈ç was published by Shuiesha Bunko in September 1989. Both editions of the book were illustrated by Hitoshi Sawano. The book also saw publication in English under two titles: \\"Gaku Stories\\", published in 1991 as part of Kodansha's English language collection, and \\"My Boy: A Father's Memories\\", published in 1992 by Kodansha International. The various sections of the novel were serialised between November 1983 and April 1985 in Seishun no Dokusho, a literary magazine published by Shueisha. Initially, there was no plan to serialise Gakumonogatari, but instead to have Shiina pen a thirty-page short story each issue. However, Shiina's first submission for this project - a story called \\"Fragrant Olive\\" which starred his son and was the author's first I Novel - received positive feedback from the editor. And this led to the story becoming a serialised I Novel based around Gaku and his family. The work was only given a collective title when the time came to gather the nine sections and publish them as a book, and no title existed at the original time of publication. Gaku's upbringing took place during a significant period of transition in both the author's work and his family life, as Shiina stumbled into writing from a career as a salaryman. And Shiina found that in his thirties, his early years as a father overlapped with his debut as an author. This made gathering material for a serialised novel difficult, so he began to write about his family life instead, reasoning that the exploits of his mischievous son could easily fill a novel. This was what gave rise to the work. One point of note is that Y≈ç Watanabe, Gaku's older sister and Shiina's eldest daughter, does not appear in the novel. Shiina has offered two reasons for this. Firstly, he had been unable to find a good opportunity to introduce her in \\"Fragrant Olive\\" and \\"Swallowtail Butterfly, the first two chapters, and after that point, the central theme of the work had become a serialised account of the relationships between members of a family, making it difficult to suddenly introduce an older sister into the mix. Secondly, Y≈ç herself, upon learning that her father was writing stories based on the family, warned him at an early stage not to write about her. = Zoku Gakumonogatari = Published in July 1986 by Shueisha. Composed of eleven sections: \\"It's a Bright Spring\\", \\"The Boy's Month of May\\", \\"Operation Eavesdropping\\", \\"The Story of Gaku\\", \\"The Mystery of Yokochin\\", \\"The Champion Belt\\", \\"A Camellia In Winter\\", \\"A Spooky Wave\\", \\"Bones and Setsubun\\", \\"The Scent of Darkness\\", and \\"Departure\\". A paperback edition was published by Shueisha Bunko in November 1989, with an afterword by Tomosuke Noda. As with previous editions, the illustrations were provided by Hitoshi Sawano. The various sections were serialised in Seishun to Dokusho between May 1985 and June 1986. The stories dealing with Gaku primarily focus on the events that took place during his later years of elementary school, depicting his rebellious days and his struggles to assert his independence from his father and find his feet as a young man. And the story closes with \\"Departure\\", a chapter which depicts the gy≈çza party thrown for Gaku to celebrate his entry into lower secondary school, as well as the day of his welcome ceremony. = Gakumonogatari: Revised Edition = Published in August 1998 by Shueisha. A single volume that contains edited versions of the previous two books. This edition notably saw the removal of two chapters that did not have any great connection to the family's life, \\"Indian Trumpet\\" and \\"A Camellia in Winter\\". Shiina also made additional edits throughout the two novels. Additionally, this edition includes Gakumonogatari and Me („ÄåÂ≤≥Áâ©Ë™û„Äç„Å®ÂÉï Gakumonogatari to Boku), an essay by Gaku Watanabe in which the subject of the novel gave his own impressions of his family life, his feelings about being used as a model for his father's work, and the reactions he had encountered from being the son of an author. This marked the first time that Gaku had commented on these things in any significant way. Synopsis =Gaku Stories= The narrator, a jack of all trades writer, and his wife, who works at a kindergarten, bring a new son into their household in Kodaira, Tokyo. They give the boy the name Gaku, meaning \\"mountain peak\\", due to their shared love of climbing. From his kindergarten days, Gaku displays a great sense of curiosity, which often gets him into trouble, as he uproots the neighbours' sweet potatoes with some friends and engages in other mischief. Living in an area crammed with English language schools and preschools, Gaku's parents struggle to settle on a direction for their son's education, before eventually enrolling him in an elementary school. Gaku enjoys a liberal upbringing, and becomes so popular that during Valentine's Day in his fourth year of school, he receives chocolates from three separate classmates. On the other hand, he enjoys much less success in his studies, picking fights with older students, and becoming a wild problem child who draws the ire of his teachers, leading his parents to be frequently called to the school. In his fourth year of school, Gaku takes his first trip to Lake Kameyama, where Mr. Noda, a friend of the narrator, lives. After being taught how to fish there, he becomes completely absorbed with the hobby, focusing on it to a degree of concentration that he has never shown to anything before. The narrator playfully asks Gaku to catch him a Japanese catfish from the Tama River, and is shocked when the boy not only looks into how to catch one, but eventually succeeds. In the summer holidays of his fifth year of school, Gaku leaves home to go canoeing down the Kushiro River with Mr. Noda. During his son's absence, the narrator reflects on his own hazy memories of boyhood. The winter of Gaku's fifth year of school arrives. The narrator, who was away from home the previous New Year due to research for his writing, makes time in his schedule, and plans an overnight fishing trip to Inatori in Higashiizu for Gaku. During this trip, Gaku discusses fishing setups and bait with the owner of the local fishing shop in specialist language that is completely alien to his father. He also uses tools his father has never seen before to skilfully catch a sea ruffe, leading the author to realise that his son is pushing into a world he has no knowledge of. One month later, the narrator, who is by then in the bitterly cold region of Irkutsk, calls home for the first time in a while. As the line crackles and threatens to cut off, he hears that Gaku fell into the ocean while fishing in Kamogawa. This deeply shocks the narrator, and he interrogates Gaku on the details, but Gaku, in sharp contrast to his father's concern, appears quite unfazed by the incident. In a cruel twist of fate, the line is cut due to the poor reception. And resigning himself to not getting any further details, the author replaces the receiver, gives a deep sigh, and bursts into solitary laughter. =Zoku Gakumonogatari= Returning home from a two-month excursion to Siberia, the narrator finds himself a little directionless. During this period, he attends a party, where a friend, Hitoshi Sawano warns him semi-jokingly that he is too invested in his son's affairs; that children will always break away from their parents eventually, and that if Shiina expects to always see eye to eye with his son, he will be in for a big shock. These words quickly come to pass; by the time Gaku's sixth year of school approaches, he has already far outstripped his father at fishing and canoeing, and has learned to mend tears in his sweat pants and make quick meals like ramen for himself after school. The play wrestling that takes place in the parlour of the Shiina household each night, too, has become so fierce that it's no longer a game, and Gaku has developed to the point where he's able to throw his father with judo techniques. As time passes, more and more signs appear that Gaku is drifting away from his parents. He becomes infuriated when his parents come to see his final sports day in his sixth year of elementary school without telling him. When the summer holidays come and he goes on a trip down the Tokachi River with his father, Mr. Noda, and some others, he spends more time with Tottan and Mittan, two brothers from his class, than with his father. He also rejects having his hair cut in the bathroom at home, which has been a tradition since his kindergarten days. And over the course of several months, he steadily disposes of many of the various magazines and toys from his childhood days scattered around his room. The narrator views this process of tidying as Gaku \\"shedding his childhood\\". The final winter of Gaku's elementary school days brings further troubles for the narrator. After a brave battle against the illness, Toshio Hoshimi, who served as the leader for the narrator's expedition across Siberia, succumbs to his cancer, and passes away. The narrator is unable to bear the thought of the man's six-year-old daughter crying in front of a father who has becomes nothing but a small pile of bones, and eventually finds himself unable to collect Toshio's bones to have them put them into an urn. He also has to deal with the rumours of murder that surround the disappearance of his high school friend Kishino, a former boxer who participated in the Tokyo Olympics, as well as his mother in law's stroke. During these difficult days, the narrator attempts to recall if he saw his own father's remains after his passing in his sixth year of elementary school, but though he clearly recalls the moments before and after the funeral, he doesn't remember any important details. As he takes Gaku to a clothes store to have him measured for his new uniform, he wonders whether his own father was hoping to live long enough to see him in a high school uniform too. During Gaku's final spring vacation, he plans a one- week excursion to Lake Kameyama with six friends including Tottan and Mittan. He warns the narrator not to come, and he and his friends make a success of the trip all on their own, without even asking Mr. Noda for help. Just before Gaku starts lower high school, the narrator invites Mr. Noda and various other friends to the house and throws a gy≈çza party for his son. And as the cherry blossoms fall from the trees, the day of Gaku's entrance ceremony arrives. With this, the sweet-natured days of Gaku's boyhood with his father come to an end, and the narrator feels as if his son has begun to take the first steps into his own world.

She went to specialized music school and classical gymnasium. During teenage years she seriously considered a career in physics, theatre or art.

In July 2019 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency imposed restrictions on the company following an inspection which it said had revealed contamination risks and that its production processes did not meet required standards. The resulting disruption of supplies to patients who rely on total parenteral nutrition was declared a national emergency by NHS England. Intravenous feed bags were imported from Norway and Germany for 511 patients. These bags are only a temporary expedient because they do not provide vital nutrients and electrolytes, such as potassium. Dozens of patients were admitted to hospital as a result. The actions of the regulator were denounced as reprehensible by clinical members of the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition who said there wasn‚Äôt any apparent forward planning or mitigation plan around what would happen when they were closed down. Calea said it ‚Äúwas directed by the MHRA to make an immediate change to the process by which we add trace elements and vitamins to our parenteral nutrition bags and we complied with the instruction. As a result, the time taken to produce bags has increased considerably and this has, unfortunately, affected the supply to patients. The MHRA stated there was no evidence to indicate that any of the Calea products manufactured and supplied to patients were contaminated. Approximately 2.8 million products were aseptically manufactured by Calea for patients and hospitals in the intervening 2015-2019 period.‚Äù The agency said they had found bacterial contamination in the production area and that the manufacturing processes in Runcorn did not meet guidelines.

It offers mainly original content and it publishes up to two articles per day. Po≈æareport was first to publish some of the largest scandals in Slovenia, including a politically sensitive Bariƒçeviƒá affair. In the current Slovenian government, three government ministers and some other office holders resigned soon after articles about them were published by Po≈æareport. The website is founded and edited by Bojan Po≈æar.  History and production  Po≈æareport was launched in 2007 by Bojan Po≈æar who had until 2016 been an editor-in-chief of Direkt, owned by daily newspaper Dnevnik. In 2016, Po≈æar published a book Melania Trump: The Inside Story, depicting life of the First Lady of the United States when she still lived in Slovenia. Since 2017, the Po≈æareport team runs a daily television political show Faktor. The first producers and journalists were Vladimir Vodu≈°ek, Bojan Po≈æar and Sebastjan Jeretiƒç. As of October 2019, Faktor is made by Alju≈° Pertinaƒç, Bernard Br≈°ƒçiƒç and Bojan Po≈æar.  Notable cases  = The Bariƒçeviƒá \\"Bullmastiff Affair\\" = On February 2, 2010, media reported a respected medical doctor named Sa≈°a Bariƒçeviƒá, who regularly treated country's elite including government ministers, was killed by his own dogs. The three Bullmastiffs were well-known to Slovenian public from events a few years earlier, when they attacked and severely injured a bypasser on a street. Although at that time the dogs were at first determined to be too dangerous to be kept alive, the Administrative Court, with judge Bo≈°tan Zalar, the brother of a minister of justice Ale≈° Zalar, ruled that the dogs should be returned to Bariƒçeviƒá. On February 5, 2010, Po≈æareport published an article that the police officers found a dildo with a condom near Bariƒçeviƒá's dead body. According to Po≈æareport, the article was viewed more than a million times, which makes it the most read article in the history of Slovenia. This claim has not been disputed. The article published a crime scene photo, secretly taken by a police officer, showing a mutilated human body, a plastic penis nearby, and an alive dog, which was visibly bloody around its anus. It also published numerous details, leaked from the police investigation, including the Bariƒçeviƒá's last words, when the police found him naked and still alive. The article also stated that for decades Sa≈°a Bariƒçeviƒá had been a transgendered female. In subsequent weeks, the police carried out internal investigation to find a person who leaked the crime scene photographs to Po≈æareport. In several subsequent articles, Po≈æareport described the friendship between Sa≈°a Bariƒçeviƒá and Minister of interior Katarina Kresal and her domestic partner attorney Miro Senica. Articles suspected that there was another person in a garage besides Bariƒçeviƒá's dogs. The morning after the tragedy, Minister of Interior unexpectedly did not appear at the weekly government meeting, she reported that she was skiing in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and a few days later she appeared with a bound on her arm. Media published photos from the crime scene of the morning after the Bariƒçeviƒá's death, showing Ministry of Agriculture State Secretary Sonja Bukovec crying and hugging sister of Bariƒçeviƒá. In the parliament, a motion of no confidence (called interpellation in Slovenia) was initiated against the Minister of Agriculture Milan Pogaƒçnik for numerous irregularities in the events related to Bariƒçeviƒá's dogs and he the minister resigned. DNA of all three dogs was found on the condom. =Peter Vilfan tax evasion= In January 2019, Po≈æareport published a series of articles revealing tax evasion by the Prime Minister Marjan ≈†arec's Cabinet State Secretary Peter Vilfan. On January 15, Vilfan made a public statement denying allegations. On March 1, 2019, Vilfan resigned. = Articles and resignation of minister Jure Leben = In February and March 2019, Po≈æareport published a series of articles disclosing documents that showed how minister Jure Leben and Public Relations agency Futura transferred money from the state budget. Leben resigned due to corruption investigation and \\"media pressure\\". = Withdrawals of political candidatures = On March 6, 2019, Po≈æareport disclosed that the European Parliament candidate Katja Damij is heavily in debts and owes unpaid taxes. In another article, Po≈æareport disclosed that she emailed her business partners denying that she was in debts, and then the political party replaced her with another candidate. On September 3, 2018, Po≈æareport disclosed that a minister candidate Tugomir Kodelja had been fired from his previous job due to improper behavior. On September 5, prime minister Marjan ≈†arec removed him from the candidates' list.  Court proceedings  Po≈æareport and Bojan Po≈æar have been sued several times. Most of these lawsuits were unsuccessful, including nine lawsuits by attorney Miro Senica. Senica and former minister Katarina Kresal filed criminal charges against Po≈æareport or Po≈æar eight times, and the authorities dropped all of them. At least once, in 2009, Bojan Po≈æar was convicted for defamation. As of October 2019, there is an ongoing court dispute between Viktor Knavs, the father of Melania Trump, and Po≈æar. Knavs claims that Po≈æareport published that he had been in jail, and Po≈æar claims that the disputed sentence was removed from the website in half an hour as soon as he was informed that it may be false.

She came to wider public prominence as a result of her shocking suicide, and most of her poems were published only posthumously. By the final part of the nineteenth century her work had been largely forgotten. It has undergone a revival since the 1970s, however. Life Ter√©z Ferenczy was born in Rimavsk√° Sobota, a mid-sized market town which at that time was in Hungary, which in turn was part of the Austrian Empire. (Today, following frontier changes, Rimavsk√° Sobota is in southern Slovakia.) While she was still very small the family relocated to Sz√©cs√©ny at the edge of the Hungarian plain to the north of Budapest. The move seems to have come about in connection with her father's work. S√°muel Ferenczy decended from various prominent and aristocratic families. Ter√©z Ferenczy's mother, born Ter√©z Ballay, was the daughter of a minor landlord in the area. The sculptor Istv√°n Ferenczy (1792‚Äì1856) was a cousin. There is no sign of much wealth having passed down to S√°muel Ferenczy: sources indicate that Ter√©z Ferenczy and her siblings grew up in conditions of some material hardship. The otherwise dilapidated little town of Sz√©cs√©ny was dominated by the baroque manor house of the Forg√°ch family, and it was for the Forg√°ch family estate that S√°muel Ferenczy worked, initially and briefly as a bookbinder, and later as manager of the distillery. In 1846 the Forg√°chs succumbed to their growing indebtedness and sold the estate at Sz√©cs√©ny to the politician-writer Ferenc Pulszky. It is not clear what impact this had on Ter√©z Ferenczy who by now was a young adult, but she would continue to live in Sz√©cs√©ny for the rest of her life. Because of the family's modest circumstances, Ferenczy's literary development is believed to have been in large measure the result of self-education. Her father's work as a book binder ensured ample access to books. Her mother died while she was still young, leaving Ter√©z and her three siblings as semi-orphans. She acquired an awareness and then a love of poetry from an early age. As a young woman she spent time in Pest where she met some of the literary celebrities of the day, including the poet K√°lm√°n Lisznyai Dam√≥ and K√°roly Bulcs√∫, possibly at the home of her kinsman, the sculptor Istv√°n Ferenczy. Her poems are undated which means that sequencing them chronologically presents a challenge. They deal with the trials and storms of love, and are tempered with an underlying strand of melancholy which appears to have intensified over time. Her first piece of published prose writing appeared in the Pest fashion magazine \\"Esk√ºszeg≈ë\\" and was a semi-autobiographical piece concerning a love tragedy (\\"...saj√°t szerelmi trag√©di√°j√°t\\"). Lajos Ferenczy, a trainee priest, seems to have been the sibling to whom Ter√©z was closest. One source describes him as \\"her confidant, comforter and support in her disappointments and loneliness\\" (\\"...a bizalmasa, csal√≥d√°saiban, mag√°nyoss√°g√°ban vigasztal√≥ja, seg√≠t≈ëje\\"). Lajos, however, took up arms in the freedom struggle and was killed on 20 June 1849. His memory is preserved in his sister's poem \\"√ì ne k√©rdj√©tek\\" (loosely, \\"Do not ask\\"). The loss exacerbated Ter√©z Ferenczy's tendency to melancholy. It was only in 1853, which would be the year of her death, that her poems began to appear in newspapers and journals. At least one source notes that suicide already ran in the Ferenczy family, and on 22 May 1853 driven, it is reported, by disappointment in love and continuing grieving over her brother's death, Ter√©z Ferenczy shot herself in the heart. As the pathologist's report points out without sentiment, she narrowly avoided the main chambers of her heart, but nevertheless succeeded in killing herself. Reports of her death led to a surge of interest in her poetry, with the first of several collections published in 1854.T√©li csillagok; Ferenczy Ter√©z hagyom√°nyaib√≥l √∂sszeszedte Bulcs√∫ K√°roly; M√ºller Gyula, Pest 1854 Published collections / anthologies (selection) * T√©li csillagok; Ferenczy Ter√©z hagyom√°nyaib√≥l √∂sszeszedte Bulcs√∫ K√°roly; M√ºller Gyula, Pest 1854 * Ferenczy Ter√©z minden versei; N√≥gr√°d Megyei M√∫zeumok Igazgat√≥s√°ga, Salg√≥tarj√°n, 1983 (N√≥gr√°di irodalmi ritkas√°gok) * T√©li csillagok.

The lyrics were written by Robert Hunter after watching a film adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles. The music, containing elements of country and folk music, was composed by Jerry Garcia on the same day. The song tells the story of a man who plays cards with a \\"dire wolf\\" on a cold winter's night in \\"Fennario\\"; the lyrics have been variously interpreted. The piece became a staple of the Grateful Dead's performances, and was played more than two hundred times between 1969 and 1995. Background and composition Robert Hunter performing in the early 1980s A few months before the release of their album Aoxomoxoa in 1969, Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter and his then-partner Christie Bourne began sharing a house with the band's guitarist Jerry Garcia, his wife, and his step-daughter. Living in close proximity gave an impetus to their collaborative song-writing: Hunter and Garcia wrote every song on Aoxomoxoa. Some time later, Hunter and Carolyn Garcia spent an evening watching a film adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles. According to Grateful Dead historian Dennis McNally, Carolyn later remarked that the hound was a \\"dire wolf\\". However, according to Hunter himself, as quoted in the Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics, he and Garcia were speculating about the identity of the hound in the story, and came up with the idea that it may have been a dire wolf. Hunter wrote the lyrics the next morning, based on images that the phrase conjured for him, and Garcia wrote the music to them later that day. Lyrics and music \\"Dire Wolf\\" is a ballad, with influences from country and folk music. Its style was described in an AllMusic review as \\"impressionistic\\", and as being similar to the writing of Bob Dylan. It is narrated by a character common to Grateful Dead songs, a \\"workingman\\", who is \\"an underdog without pretense or slick-ness, part of the old gritty America\\". The narrative is \\"deceptively simple\\": the story tells of the man sitting down to dinner on a cold winter's day in \\"Fennario\\", after which the listener never sees him again. The narrator says that he wakes in the middle of the night to find a dire wolf outside his window. The wolf is invited in for a game of cards, and despite the frequent refrain \\"don't murder me\\", he eventually \\"collects his due\\". The location named \\"Fennario\\" appears in the folk song \\"The Bonnie Lass o' Fyvie\\", including in the Grateful Dead's version of that song. It refers to a fictional location; a friend of the band members commented in an interview that it was the perfect name for a generic place, because it was evocative, and had four syllables. In contrast, music writer Buzz Poole speculated that the name may be derived from Fenrir, a mythical Nordic wolf who was chained up by the gods. The phrase \\"don't murder me\\", repeated in the chorus, was a reference by Garcia to his experiences driving around the San Francisco Bay Area at the time that the Zodiac Killer was active. The lyrics have been interpreted to suggest that the man's difficulties were self-inflicted, perhaps as the result of a profligate lifestyle. This theme, of whether humans are victims of forces outside of them or creators of their own destinies, is a recurring one in the band's music. Poole comments that the lyrics intentionally hearken back to an earlier period of United States history, and of the \\"calculated risks of Manifest Destiny\\". The \\"red whiskey\\" referred to American Bourbon, whereas the now-extinct dire wolf was also exclusively from the Americas. According to McNally, the wolf in the lyrics symbolizes the devil, who, in their \\"postmodern, post-Christian cosmology\\", they invited in to their homes for a game of cards, and tried to have a good time with. Release and performances The studio recording of the song was released as the third piece on the album Workingman's Dead in May 1970. Its first known performance was at San Francisco's California Hall, on June 7, 1969. The song became a staple of the Grateful Dead's live performances; the electric version of the song was typically featured on the band's first set. According to The Grateful Dead's 100 Essential Songs, \\"Dire Wolf\\" was played 226 times between 1969 and 1995, and was played every year, except for 1975. Sixty-three of these performances were in the first two years after the song was written. In later years, the acoustic version of the piece became more common. The structure and pace of the song did not change much over the years. It was sung most often by Garcia, although an early version featured Bob Weir on vocals, with Garcia playing the pedal steel guitar instead. An AllMusic review of this version praised Garcia's \\"sweet\\" guitar playing as a \\"great feature\\" of the song. Its lyrics have led to it being described as an essential Grateful Dead song by commentators.

In 1895 this portrait was displayed in the Worcester Historical Museum. Hepsibeth Hemenway (March 25, 1763 - Feb. 17, 1847) was a Nipmuc Indian known particularly as a baker of wedding cakes for the wealthy in Worcester, Massachusetts. During her early years she struggled as a laundress and cook to support her family yet towards the end of her life she became quite successful. She is remembered today primarily by older families as a great cook and for having an excellent hand in making wedding cakes. Her portrait now hangs in the Worcester Historical Museum to remember her for her achievements as an Indian woman.  Family and life  On March 25, 1763, Lydia Bowman and Crosman became parents to their daughter Hepsibeth. Lydia was a Nipmuc Indian, and Crosman was a white man, making Hepsibeth a child of mixed race. Although Hepsibeth had both of her parents in her life on town records, she is listed primarily as the daughter of Lydia Bowman. This is due to the fact that it was illegal for an Indian woman and white man to be married at the time of her birth. Hepsibeth was young when she lost both of her parents. Her father, Crosman, died in the Revolutionary War and a few months later, in 1784, her mother, Lydia, died a pauper. Having to support herself, Hepsibeth worked as a servant for judge Timothy Paine and his family. She worked for this family until 1789 when she met Revolutionary War veteran Jeffrey Hemenway. Jeffrey Hemenway was a man of Indian and African-American descent. In 1792 Hepsibeth, twenty-six years old, and Jeffrey, fifty-three years old, were married. During their time as a married couple, they had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood. In 1819, Jeffrey died, leaving Hepsibeth a widow at age fifty-six. Having to support her family by herself, Hepsibeth took in laundry, and also cooked and made wedding cakes.  Wedding cakes  After the passing of her husband, Hepsibeth moved to a smaller home on Mechanic Street in Worcester near the Hope Cemetery. In her new home, she began to focus on her work as a laundress, cook, and baker of wedding cakes, for which she is most remembered. Although there is little information on where Hepsibeth learned her cooking and baking skills, it is assumed that she taught herself while working for the Paine family. With her position as a servant, she helped the Paine family by preparing food in their kitchen. There is no surviving record to show exactly what Hepsibeth‚Äôs famous cakes looked like, however they are explained to be different from modern cakes. One customer described her wedding cake in this way: ‚ÄúIts garb was purely white; Paradisiacal grains were scattered over its surface, & it was studded with gilded almonds. In the centre towered a beautiful collection of artificial flowers & round its body was a wreath of laurel.‚Äù When Hepsibeth passed away in 1847, her daughter Hannah Hemenway continued her cake business. While a girl, Hannah assisted her mother when she made wedding cakes for her prominent customers. Hannah wanted to keep up the tradition because her mom, Hepsibeth, was well known in Worcester, and many people recommended her cakes to others for their wedding days. The hand-made cakes were always in demand, and for many years, Hannah followed in her mother‚Äôs footsteps as a cake baker.  Portrait  In the 1840s, artist Henry Woodward painted a portrait of Hepsibeth Hemenway. Woodward was introduced to Hepsibeth when he was sent to paint a picture of the Hope Cemetery. At the time, many were questioning if the space of the cemetery was being rightfully used. Some argued that the bodies needed to be moved because children needed space to play, while others disagreed. Since Hepsibeth lived so close to the Hope Cemetery, Woodward included the clothes line of laundry that was in Hepsibeth's yard in his painting. Woodward was said to be intrigued by Hepsibeth and decided to paint a portrait of her. In the 1840s, it was rare for a woman of a mixed-race background to have a portrait painted. In the portrait, Hepsibeth wears elaborate clothing which are believed to be passed down from the upper class customers of her cake business. The portrait portrays what looks to be a middle to upper class woman of Native American descent. In 1895, the portrait of Hepsibeth Hemenway became a part of the Worcester Historical Museum located in Worcester Massachusetts, where she was well known.

The novel follows the adventures of a Reuel, a mixed-race American as he travels to Ethiopia from America searching for treasure. The novel explores issues of love, identity, trauma and spirituality through the perspective of the African American community.  Plot summary  The novel starts with Reuel Briggs in his apartment alone in Boston, Massachusetts, ruminating on his financial troubles as a medical student. Determined to improve his friend's mood, Aubrey persuades Reuel to attend a ‚ÄúNegro music‚Äù concert. There Reuel witnesses the talented Dianthe Lusk, a light-skinned ‚ÄúNegress‚Äù from the South, perform in the Fisk University Singers and becomes infatuated with her beautiful voice and appearance. They attend a house party hosted by Molly Vance, who is engaged to Aubrey, and her brother, Charlie. The group decides to visit the local Hyde House, which is rumored to be haunted, where Reuel encounters a spectral form of Dianthe, who requests Reuel's help. That next morning, Reuel is called to treat the victims of a train accident. Among them is Dianthe, seemingly dead, but he revives her using a form of mesmerism. The revived Dianthe has no memory of her former self and Reuel's colleagues believe he has performed a miracle. Reuel and Aubrey persuade Dianthe to live with the Vance family under another name until she recovers and relearns her identity. Reuel falls in love with Dianthe during the stay and proposes to her. She accepts. Wanting to provide for his fianc√©e, he approaches Aubrey for work. Aubrey asks Raul to accompany him on a dangerous but lucrative archaeological expedition to Ethiopia. Reuel, Charlie, and Aubrey's servant, Titus Crow, prepare for the expedition, since Aubrey elects to stay in Boston with Molly and Dianthe. Charlie and Reuel frequently write back home, but eventually stop receiving correspondence. They travel first to Egypt, and then via desert caravan to Ethiopia, where they seek the treasures of Meroe. They encounter many dangers on their journey. Soon after their arrive at the ruin, however, they receive news from America that Molly and Dianthe drowned in a boating accident on the Charles River near Boston. Mad with grief, Reuel disappears into the city's ruins to die. But he is kidnapped by unseen foes. He awakensin a luxurious palace within the hidden city of Telassar, built by the inhabitants of Meroe. A native man named Ai, who had passed as a local guide for the expedition, reveals his identity as a councilor and minister of Telassar. Ai introduces Reuel to Candace, the Queen of Telassar, and begins to fall in love with her. Meanwhile, Charlie and Titus search for Reuel, eventually discovering a secret passage beneath the ruins of Meroe. Telassar's soldiers captures them, but the two manage to escape into the city's tombs where they find a hoard of precious metals and gemstones surrounded by booby traps. Reuel and his guards rescue Charlie from the traps, but Titus is mortally wounded. Before he dies, Titus confesses that Aubrey had ordered him to murder Reuel so that he would never return from Africa. To substantiate Titus's confession, Reuel commands Ai to use his people's magic to spy on Aubrey. They learn that Aubrey murdered Molly and faked Dianthe's death so as to marry her in secret. Enraged, Reuel and his companions return to America to seek revenge on Aubrey. While being coerced by Aubrey to marry him, Dianthe gradually regains her memory and meets Hannah, an elderly former slave of the Livingstons. Hanna comforts Dianthe and teaches her that she, Aubrey, and Reuel are half-siblings, and that their mother, Mira, was a women of Ethiopian descent enslaved by Aubrey's father. Distraught, Dianthe attempts to poison Aubrey in the night, but he thwarts her and forces Dianthe to drink the poison. Aubrey flees the estate that next morning and abandons Dianthe to her fate. She tries to clings to life, but Reuel arrives at the Livingston estate as Dianthe dies. While traveling alone, Aubrey receives a vision that Dianthe still lives and quickly returns home, and is greeted by Reuel's men. They subdue Aubrey and condemn him. Their magic causes him to drown himself in a river. After Aubrey's death, Reuel learns they are all of one blood. Shocked by this news, Reuel returns to Telassar to serve as King and to teach his people about the new world.  Main characters  *Reuel Briggs: The main protagonist of the novel, Reuel is a young man of mixed race and an accomplished medical student, even though he has a history of financial struggle without the support of his family. He does what he can to survive, which includes limiting his social life to school within the four walls of his apartment. Reuel is aware of his African American heritage, but he does not care to learn the history of African Americans. Instead, he merely passes as a white man because of his light skin tone. His romance with Dianthe Lusk becomes a keystone of the novel, but their relationship is fraught and comes to a bitter end. Only once he is bereaved of his love and realizes his royal lineage in Telassar does Reuel embrace his \\"inner self.\\" *Aubrey Livingston: Reuel's closest friend, Aubrey takes it upon himself to assist Reuel whenever possible. He is a southern white man who befriends Reuel despite his skin color, and his attempts to make the protagonist socialize among their peers are endless. While Aubrey promises Reuel great fortune in an archaeological expedition to Ethiopia, he secretly plots to steal Reuel's love interest and later fianc√©e, Dianthe, for himself, even despite being engaged to another woman. His lust for Dianthe ultimately drives Aubrey to murder, betrayal, and his own undoing. *Dianthe Lusk: A \\"Negress\\" from the South with a beautiful voice and talent for singing, Dianthe doesn't meet the protagonist until she is close to death after an accident. Reuel saves her life and soon believes that they are destined to be together, doing all that he can to shelter and tend to her. He and Aubrey even withhold the truth of Dianthe's identity when she loses her memory following the accident. Some would say she battles with hysteria following the traumatic events she suffers throughout the novel, especially after Aubrey seduces and manipulates Dianthe into marrying him. *Charlie Vance: Introduced as a friend of Reuel and Aubrey, as well as brother to Aubrey's fianc√©e, Molly Vance, Charlie is a flamboyant young man from an upper-class background. Known as \\"Adonis\\" for his well-groomed appearance and fondness of high society life, he later accompanies Reuel to Ethiopia in search of fortune and adventure. *Ai: The prime minister to a prophesied King destined to restore the Ethiopian line to its former glory, Ai serves as Reuel's counsel upon his arrival to Telassar. He shares with Reuel the wonders of their city and offers him the choice of becoming their King. *Queen Candace: A young woman that Reuel meets while in Telassar, Candace serves as the Queen of Telassar in the absence of a King. Her existence is almost metaphysical as she is reborn in a sense; Candace is the virgin queen who reigns in intervals of fifteen years while sharing the name of her successor. Reuel begins to fall in love with Candace upon learning of Dianthe's apparent death. *Hannah: An elderly former slave belonging to the Livingstons, Hannah comforts Dianthe after she is coerced into marrying Aubrey. Hannah also informs Dianthe of her history and relationship with Aubrey and Reuel as half- siblings, having tended to them as infants. *Mira: The late mother of Dianthe, Reuel, and Aubrey, Mira was a royal citizen of Telassar who traveled the world before she was enslaved by Aubrey Livingston's father. During her enslavement at the Livingston estate, she entertained the family and their guests with parlor tricks and prophecies.  Background  The novel's title was inspired by Acts 17:26 in the Bible: \\"Of one blood I made all nations of man to dwell upon the whole face of the earth (...) No man can draw the dividing line between the two races, for they are both of one blood!\\" Hopkins's main purpose in writing the novel was to expose and unravel the entangled genealogies of blacks and whites, the irrefutable evidence that they were literally, biologically, \\"of one blood\\". The text's collective argument, according to its introduction, is that blood has so effortlessly mixed between the two races that any attempt to disentangle them is rendered impossible. The novel is considered as a novel that \\"deals in no uncertain terms with both the temporal and spiritual solution of the greatest question of the age- The Negro.\\" According to Colleen O'Brien, critics often regard it as one of the earliest articulations of Black internationalism because it is the first African- American novel to both feature African characters and take place in Africa. The novel was published in the same year that W. E. B. Du Bois originated the famous phrase \\"the color line\\" in his collection of essays The Souls of Black Folk (1903), in which the phrase describes the hypothetically dividing line between the white and black races. Hopkins's originating the text in Boston honed in on one of the epicenters of debate in the United States on \\"blood\\", bloodlines, and roots of \\"human family\\". The selection of \\"The Hidden Self\\" as the subtitle serves as a \\"metaphor for the suppressed history of oppressive social and familial relations under the institution of slavery.\\"  Themes  The novel drifts between two genres, romantic and realistic, as the protagonist, a Harvard medical student, moves from one country to the other. Focusing on Reuel's racial passing as a white man, Of One Blood; Or, The Hidden Self begins in The United States and slowly progresses to Africa with his discovery of the hidden city and advancement from ‚Äúpasser to prophet.‚Äù = Haitian culture = Though recognized for its affiliation with twentieth- century Africanisms, the novel also employs concepts popularly associated to Haitian culture. According to Mary Grace Albanese, the matrilineality of the novel's female characters Hannah, Mira, and Dianthe Lusk resonates with historical and mythologized Haitian perceptions of womanhood, and the preternatural abilities and practices displayed throughout the novel are significant to Haitian Vodou. =The burden of royalty= In the story, scholar Melissa Asher Daniels has stated that by journeying into the hidden world, Reuel's royal bloodline not only makes him the heir to a long, rich history of African achievement, but also crowns him as king to a body of people that he previously rejected being a part of. This prophecy that his being there is fulfilling not only burdens him, but drags Reuel into a world that he may not have otherwise accepted. =Race= People were associated with a particular race by their physical features. In the United States, race stands as a dominant governing characteristic that dictates an individual's social standing. Moving to the African part of Hopkins's narrative of a Utopian world, it is presented as an important factor for cultural worth but otherwise meaningless. Even with the \\"one drop\\" rule, Reuel was able to pass as a white male even though he is African American. Physical features do not always define your race and that was a dominant message in the novel as race is a social construct. =Mysticism= Seen most prominently through the sages that serve the queen and the temple in which they meet, mysticism remains a strong underlying theme as Reuel ventures through the hidden city, blanketed over by the power of kings that were his forefathers. This can also be seen as Reuel tries to interpret various visions throughout the novel that depict upcoming events in his travels and Dianthe's resurrection. =Culture= Reuel leaves America with no knowledge or care for his ancestral history; he sees culture more as a crutch than a gift and it's this mindset of blissful ignorance that leads him towards a relationship he'll regret. He felt disconnected from his African American roots because of his persistence to identify himself as an Anglo-Saxon. He's comfortable passing for white because it means that the world must see him for everything else that he is. The resolution for many, if not all of his problems, is found while later embracing where he came from. =Love and trauma= The idea of love is one that is common throughout the novel, but the accuracy of saying these relationships stem from love is something that could be questioned. When it comes to Reuel and Dianthe, love only comes after major trauma. Reuel may have loved her (or at least lusted after her) but was she ever really in the mindset to return these feelings? Looking at Aubrey, everything between him and Dianthe was forced but he wanted a relationship because Reuel had her. It plays into society's ideology that as a \\"white\\" man, he had rights to everything and more that a black man could have, so why not just take it? Consent was never something he considered. Hopkins used Dianthe to portray the sexual abuse and trauma that many African-American women underwent during and after slavery. =Hysteria= Dianthe's character is used to depict that the horrible diagnosis of hysteria that affected many women was not something that was only put upon white females. She portrays many of the symptoms that were used by physicians to diagnose patients and even goes through similar treatments. =Water= Water is the source of life, but it's also a means for travel (by boat and portal), a carrier of death in form of poison, the final resting place for two characters, and a mirror that reflects images that onlookers in the novel may not care to see. An ocean is what separates our protagonist from the hidden city but it's also what carries him back. Molly and Aubrey are both drowned at different points and both times, Reuel uses water to transport to or away from the bodies. =Memory= It's the loss of memory that not only stimulates a relationship between Reuel and Dianthe, but also causes a lot of conflict throughout the story line all together. The three siblings cross paths when they do but fail to remember their origins until the very end. These memories lead Reuel back to Africa. =Science vs. spirituality= Blood plays a major role in the novels main theme to describe that the human race, no matter origin or social class, stem from one birthplace, a scientific argument that Hopkins strongly supports. She also uses science to explain African spirituality that can be seen through the novel's mystic undertones by simplifying concepts of fate that a sceptic audience would otherwise not believe. =Incest= White-passing children of an enslaved woman, as seen through Reuel, Aubrey, and Dianthe. Incest is one of many common narratives buried beneath the nightmare that was American chattel slavery. Sometimes it happened by accident as white captors destroyed any information of their African lineage. In other scenarios, it was forced to increase numbers.

Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. After his husband, John Arthur, died in 2013, and his inability to legally be considered Arthur's surviving spouse on his death certificate, Obergefell took to court, beginning his years of fighting for same-sex rights.  Court appearance  After getting married and meeting with Al Gerhardstein, a local civil rights attorney, they were told that due to Ohio's same-sex marriage ban, Obergefell cannot be listed as Arthur's surviving spouse on his death certificate. They later filed a lawsuit, and the Ohio case became known as Obergefell v. Kasich.. A federal judge agreed to hear the case the following court day due to Arthur's illness. The judge ruled in Obergefell's favor, but the state of Ohio appealed to a higher court and won, resulting in Obergefell's appeal to the Supreme Court. Arthur died and soon, Obergefell devoted his time and became committed to legalizing same-sex marriage for all with the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges. The two questions that would drive Obergefell‚Äôs appeal to court would be: 1) whether it was constitutional for states to discriminate between gay and straight couples in granting marriage licenses and 2) whether the Constitution required every state to recognize legal marriages of same sex couples who were married in another state. The case took place on Friday, June 26 in 2015 and Obergefell won with the support of five judges. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion for the case, stated in the court: ‚ÄúNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.‚Äù After winning the case, Obergefell stated: ‚Äúaffirms what millions across the country already know to be true in their hearts: our love is equal. The four words etched onto the front of the Supreme Court ‚Äòequal justice under law‚Äô apply to us, too.‚Äù President Barack Obama reached out to congratulate Obergefell and thanked him for ‚Äúhis leadership that has changed our country.‚Äù  Media appearance  When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Obergefell was very vocal in the media on his opinions of the judge‚Äôs decision to resign. Obergefell admitted to feeling ‚Äúdespondent‚Äù because he believed the loss of Justice Kennedy could have repercussions, especially for the LGBTQ+ community. Obergefell believes Justice Kennedy‚Äôs legacy is undermined by this decision to retire during a Trump presidency. Obergefell stated on the issue that \\"I wouldn‚Äôt trust any Justice nominated by this president to respect and protect LGBTQ+ rights.\\" Obergefell also was in the press when he was invited by Michelle Obama to attend Obama's final State of the Union address. When asked about why he received the honor to sit in the box of the first lady, Obergefell said: ‚ÄúWe the people. This core American belief is why the other marriage-equality plaintiffs and I, and so many others before us, stood up to fight for our rights.‚Äù  Career  Prior to his experience in court, Obergefell was a consultant and realtor in Ohio. He consulted with his partner Arthur. After the case won in the Supreme Court in 2016, Obergefell spent a year traveling to speak around the globe about the case and his own life. While Obergefell is credited with the victory of a landmark Supreme Court case, he had made it apparent he was not undergoing the case for financial reasons. He would only receive $225 in social security benefits and potentially a small disabilities benefit when he retired from the state of Ohio. Obergefell cofounded Equality Vines after the trial, the first cause based wine label that supports organizations devoted to civil rights and equality for all. He also works with Keppler Speakers as a speaker and an activist. Most notably, Obergefell co-authored the book Love Wins with Debbie Cenziper. The book explores the lives of the lovers and lawyers who were essential to the victory of Obergefell v. Hodges. Obergefell now also volunteers to officiate weddings, having officiated 8 same sex marriages and one straight couple after the victory of his trial. In February 2016, soon after the court ruling, Obergefell moved to Washington, D.C., to continue pursuing his political endeavors. After three long years of activism in D.C., Obergefell decided, in 2019, to move back to Ohio to reclaim his roots, return to his role as an uncle to 17, and announce a new act. When asked about his favorite memory from his time in D.C., Obergefell said, \\"To be in that courtroom and have it finally sink in as Justice Kennedy [read] the decision that we won, and that John could finally rest in peace. And that people like us around the country could get married, it's hard to top that.\\" Obergefell looks forward to working on advancing LGBTQ and minority rights on a state level, starting with his home state of Ohio, since federal progress does not currently seem as attainable.  Early life  Obergefell graduated from Sandusky High School in 1984 and went on to attend the University of Cincinnati where he earned a degree in secondary education and German.\\"Jim Obergefell.\\" In Gale Biography Online Collection.

He attended graduate school at Bowling Green State University. Out of college, he was a high school German teacher. After years of hiding his sexuality, finally, when he was in his mid-20s, he came out to his eldest sister. At the time, his mother was dead, but the rest of his family was not too surprised by his announcement. While his dad was not always supportive, he found a strong relationship with his Aunt Paulette.Hammond, Gretchen R. \\"Obergefell Recalls Marriage-Equality Fight.\\" Windy City Times, Oct 19, 2016, pp. 11. . Obergefell v. Hodges case  Personal life  Then, in 1992, at a bar near the University of Cincinnati, Obergefell met John Arthur, a man who soon, after several different interactions and a district and Supreme Court case, became his husband. Obergefell and Arthur became inseparable. They began dating, moved in together, worked in IT consulting and client relations management at several companies, and after years of being together, Arthur was diagnosed with ALS. Obergefell acted as Arthur‚Äôs caretaker for the rest of their relationship, helping his partner through every wave of the illness. By 2013, he became bed bound and Obergefell and Arthur decided to get married. Same-sex marriage was illegal in their home state of Ohio so in order to get married, they would have to go to another state.\\"Same-Sex Marriage Supreme Court Decision, June 26, 2015.\\" In Historic U.S. Events.

On June 11, 2013, the couple got an ambulance to escort Arthur to a private plane that flew Arthur, Obergefell, a nurse, and Arthur's aunt, who performed the ceremony, to Baltimore, where the marriage was performed while the plane sat on the tarmac. After 22 years of being together, Arthur died on October 22, 2013.  Recognition  In 2016, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati honored Obergefell with the Everyday Freedom Hero award. The award is given to people whose actions reflect the ideals of the underground railroad.\\"Jim Obergefell, Same-Sex Marriage Plaintiff, to be Honored.\\" Between the Lines, Oct 20, 2016, pp. 9. . The city council of Cincinnati made June 28, the day of the ruling, John Arthur Day as a tribute to the Supreme Court case from the two men who lived there together for two decades. The mayor of the city, John Cranley, referred to Obergefell as a ‚Äúhistoric figure‚Äù for their city and the country. In 2015, Foreign Policy named Obergefell one of its 2015 Global Thinkers. In the same year, Out magazine also named Obergefell on its 2015 Out 100 list. Obergefell was also appointed to be a member of the National Advisory Board for the GLBT Historical Society and the Board of Advisors for the Mattachine Society of Washington DC. Obergefell has also been honored by the ACLU of Southern California, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, and the Santa Clara University School of Law.

Hanna lived and worked in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Bristol, Maine. His art predominantly focused on the structures, furnishings, and people of those regions.  Biography  left = Early life = David Hanna was born in 1941 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the youngest child of a large working-class family. Hanna left school at the age of 14 to work at a gas station and then a dance studio. In 1959, he married Carolyn Jean Elco, a dance instructor. From 1960 to 1964, Hanna served in the Army Special Services, Airborne Division in Laos and Vietnam. While in the military, he earned the equivalent of a high school diploma. = Career = 250x250px In 1964, Hanna returned to Pittsburgh and began pursuing a career as an artist. His work was first shown in an exhibit at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in 1965, where he displayed 17 paintings. In 1966, he moved to Chester County, Pennsylvania, to study the Brandywine tradition of American realist painting. That same year, members of the Mellon family organized an exhibit of Hanna's work in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, and by 1967, his work had been featured at galleries including the International Art Gallery in South Hills, Pennsylvania, and the Washington Gallery of Art in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC. Night Watch, 1971 In 1967, Hanna moved with his family to Bristol, Maine. The family first resided in the Pemaquid Point Lighthouse and later in a house in the village of Round Pond. A large body of work between 1968 and 1975 includes paintings and drawings such as Two Different Horizons (1971), Night Watch (1971), and Final Farewell (1975) depicting Captain Alexander Breede (d. 1971), a retired seaman. Hanna continued to paint, draw, and sculpt through the 1970s. His work was shown in museums and galleries including the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center and the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, drawing interest from collectors and commentators including Paul A. Chew, a former director of the Westmoreland, and George Nama, an artist and teacher of draftsmanship and printmaking at the University of Pittsburgh. A Million Miles Away, 1971 In 1971, Hanna was included in the traveling exhibition \\"Brandywine Tradition Artists: Featuring the works of Howard Pyle, Frank E. Schoonover, the Wyeth Family, Charles Colombo, David Hanna (1971-1972),\\" which showed in six museums across the United States. During the 1970s, Hanna also contributed works to a 1973 book titled The White House Gardens: A History and Pictorial Record with commentary by Rachel Lambert Mellon, often known as Bunny Mellon, a renowned horticulturalist, gardener, and art collector whose family owned a number of Hanna's works. alt= The exhibition \\"David Hanna: Paintings, Watercolors, Drawings\\", organized in 1977 by Chew at the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, featured 78 artworks including depictions of Hanna‚Äôs children such as A Million Miles Away (1971), the architecture and furnishings of his native Pennsylvania, and the landscape, buildings, and inhabitants of Maine and other New England states, such as The Keith House (1974-1975). Hanna suffered a fatal heart attack on January 13, 1981, while traveling in Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife and seven children.

Olive High School, the 1920 U.S. Census records the earlier year of birth; his 1935 obituary suggests the later year died 1935) was an American architect based in Goldsboro in Wayne County, North Carolina. He practiced in North Carolina from 1920 until his death in 1935. Several of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It has been asserted that he \\"is chiefly remembered for the Colonial- and Classical Revival-style dwellings he designed in Goldsboro.\\" Thirteen works by Gullett in North Carolina, all built of brick between 1922 and 1935, are known to have survived to 2000. \\"Of these, the former Mount Olive High School remains one of his most significant designs in its utilatarian yet refined treatment of Classical Revival decoration and form.\\" That school has also been described as Gullett's \\"most ambitious undertaking\\". Gullett was born either in 1875 or 1880 in Amite City, Louisiana. Per his 1935 obituary he trained as an architect in Mississippi. By 1908 he was an architect in Birmingham, Alabama, partnering with Daniel Helmich (1854-1917) who designed the 1901 Birmingham City Hall and retired in 1913. Gullett had an office in the Brown-Marx Building in Birmingham in 1910, at which time he was living with Daniel Helmich and Helmich's wife. Gullett married sometime during 1910-1912, and became a draftsman for architect H.B. Wheelock in 1912. He left that employment by 1917 and was again practicing on his own in 1917. The Wheelock Building, a brick Classical Revival style commercial building designed by Wheelock's firm, has exterior details similar to those of Gullett's later non-residential works in North Carolina. Gullett took and passed North Carolina's Architectural Board exam in 1920 in order to practice in North Carolina, which he did until his death in 1935. Works include: *John Clifford Grimsley House (c.1916), 432 10th St., Fayette, Alabama, NRHP-listed.

Career Since 1977 Sanou has directed or been the screenwriter of over 25 documentary, fiction, and animated films. He also directed the television series Taxi Brousse, serving as producer as well from 2001 to 2004. His first film of note was Paweogo (The Immigrant), released in 1982 with production by CINAFRIC, a company set up by local businessman Martial Ou√©draogo to produce and distribute local Burkinab√© films. However, shortly after the completion of the film, CINAFRIC went bankrupt and had to close due to lack of investment. Paweogo would be the only film the company ever produced. The film was, however, nominated for that year's FESPACO awards, although it did not win. Sanou served as director and screenwriter for the 2004 film Tasuma, a comedy-drama of a Burkinab√© war veteran who had fought for France abroad returning to his home village. The film was well received by critics although Dave Kehr noted that the film fell back on old tropes of African cinema such as a folkloric theme and the setting of the noble village.

He lives and works in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Life and career  Diego Bianchi received his degree in graphic design from the University of Buenos Aires in 1992, after which he participated in a critique seminar run by Pablo Siquier between 2002 and 2003. Between 2003 and 2005, Bianchi also participated in a program for visual artists co-run by the Centro Cultural Ricardo Rojas and the University of Buenos Aires, funded by the Beca Kuitca scholarship. He subsequently received a scholarship to attend Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (Maine, USA), from which he graduated in 2006. Bianchi has accrued extensive teaching experience, leading numerous workshops around the world. These include a number of critique seminars at the Universidad Torcuato di Tella Buenos Aires (2013, 2015); an Antiproject workshop at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin in Dresden, Germany (2016); and an artist workshop at the Mandale Fruta Lugano in Buenos Aires (2017). He has received a number of awards, including the arteBA-Petrobras Award to the visual arts in 2007 and the Grant of Secretar√≠a de Cultura de la Naci√≥n in 2006. He is represented by the Galerie Jocelyn Wolff in Paris, France.  Artistic Work  A prominent figure on the Latin American art scene, Diego Bianchi‚Äôs artistic work is made up of eclectic sculptures and installations, often utilizing elements of performance, which address both aesthetic standards and socio-political subjects. His pieces are constructed with visually transgressive materials that range from discarded objects such as chairs, pipes or electronics, to colorful casts of various body-parts, seemingly put together in a haphazard manner to create curious constructions that fill up the exhibition space. While the choice of material remains relatively open, Bianchi often works with smooth surfaces and placing and attaching them in various constellations. The discarded elements ‚Äì which could be considered as trash ‚Äì are transferred by the artist into a new context through their placement in a different artistic ecosystem, aesthetically working to ‚Äúdesanctify the work of art‚Äù through their constant reconstructions. This approach is most visible in Bianchi‚Äôs recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires, El presente est√° encantador (2017), in which a number of individual sculptures made up of haphazardly fused and seemingly random elements take over the space holding the museum‚Äôs permanent collection, directing the viewer into a dialogue with his precedents. Diego Bianchi‚Äôs work is situated on the border between realist and conceptualist traditions, with many of his approach being traceable to the oeuvre of European artists such as Piero Manzoni, Daniel Spoerri, Guiseppe Penone, Arman. One of the more dominant themes of Bianchi‚Äôs work is the repetitive use of the human body as an artistic element. While visible already in his earlier works, the emphasis on the physical has become more influential in his recent sculptures and installations. Citing the words of feminist artist Barbara Krueger, he takes an approach in which the ‚Äúbody is more a battlefield than a temple‚Äù, and therefore an object to be dismembered and distorted. These recent works, such as Pooldance 4 (2017) or Multileg (2017), actively assemble and dis-assemble the borders between the human and the object. Linked to overarching themes of deconstruction and unraveling, these works disrupt the viewer‚Äôs expectations and play with the borders between the personal and the impersonal.{{cite journal last1=Massacese first1=Julieta title=Life Ensues at Another Pace: Uses and Dimensions of the Body in the Work of Diego Bianchi journal=RUB: Perspectivas sobre la obra de Diego Bianchi/Perspectives on the Work of Diego Bianchi date=2019} The Suspension of Disbelief (2014) is a work which activates these notions in a performance piece. Taking over the entire room, the installation is activated by the performer who suspended on a web of strings attached to his clothing and to his body: the mouth, a finger, his uncovered penis or from both sides of his t-shirt. Every movement also moves the strings, connecting the body to eerie objects that resemble severed body-parts formed out of latex or plastic, or to everyday objects such as a broom or a chair. The preoccupation with the physical appears also in earlier installations, such as the entrance designed by the artist for his exhibition Imperialismo Minimalism (2006) at the Sendros Gallery in Buenos Aires. Placing a steep wooden ramp over the stairs located in the entry to the gallery, Bianchi forces visitors to engage in a physical effort to enter the space as they are left to climb up the construction with the help of ropes. In addition to aesthetic considerations, Bianchi‚Äôs work also examines political themes linked to the precarious socio-economic situation in his home country and the critique of an (art) consumer society, grappling with the paradox created by the simultaneous decay of social norms thanks to the ongoing global crisis and the more hopeful outlook to the future. Starting at the early 2000s, his pieces reflect the evolution of this process brought to the foreground by the spread of neoliberalist policies in Latin America, expressed through an extensive engagement with the relationship between bodies, objects and the spaces which they inhabit. At the same time, through exhibitions such as Shutdown (2016), the artist engages with the perceived numbness of the contemporary art world towards social issues, and the disconnect between the proliferation of aesthetically idyllic art and the more brutal world which it inhabits.

Legislation pertaining to heritage management consists of Republic Acts and Presidential Decrees. Organizations such as UNESCO, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, and the Heritage Conservation Society are also referred to in laws. Republic Acts are pieces \\"of legislation used to create policy in order to carry out the principles of the Constitution.\\" They are written by Congress and approved by the President. The National Heritage act is a Republic Act which created the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property and gave ultimate power to the National Museum of the Philippines. The Local Government Code is a Republic Act which required the national government to collaborate with local governing bodies when preparing to damage land. The General Appropriations Acts are Republic Acts which required certain agencies to avoid damaging cultural properties including bridges, train stations, capitol buildings, and universities. The Indigenous Peoples' Act was a Republic Act which gave consideration and ownership to indigenous people who would be affected by any excavation or damage. The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act required digging teams to report findings to the Director of the National Museum. The purpose of Presidential Decrees was and is \\"to arrogate unto the Chief Executive the lawmaking powers of Congress.\\"https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/section/laws/executive- issuances/presidential-decrees-executive-issuances/ Presidential Decree No. 105 defined National Shrines and enforced their safety by threatening violators with 10 or more years in prison, a fine of 10,000 pesos, or both. Presidential Decree No. 374 provided a definition for the phrase National Cultural Treasure. Presidential Decree No. 374 added certain sites to the list of Philippine National Cultural Treasures. Presidential Decree No. 1505 made it illegal to ‚Äúmodify, alter, repair, or destroy‚Äù the natural state of national shrines and landmarks without consent from the National Historical Institute of the Philippines, punishable by 1 to 5 years in prison or a fine between 1,000 and 10,000 pesos. These laws can be separated into categories such as built environment, indigenous peoples' laws, and intangible heritage. The National Cultural Heritage Act is an example of built environment legislation, the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act is an example of indigenous peoples' legislation, and both Presidential Decree No. 374 and the Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act refer to National Cultural Treasures which include intangible heritage. Heritage management in the Philippines is not only about archaeology, it is about peoples' relationship to, and ownership of, their culture.  Republic Acts  = National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 =  (Republic Act No. 10066)  An act which established a Philippine Registry of Cultural Property, which was to be controlled by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. It also gave protection to buildings that were more than 50 years old. It established categories of cultural property, such as works by a national artist, archaeological and traditional ethnographic materials, archival material dating to at least 50 years, and works of national heroes. It created guidelines for anthropological research, such as a requirement to communicate with the National Museum of the Philippines before organizations can be allowed to excavate and a requirement to document findings with the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property. The National Cultural Heritage Act also prohibited acts such as destroying, modifying, or mutilating any world heritage site and selling or distributing material that was lost by its rightful owner. = Local Government Code of 1991 =  (Republic Act No. 7160)  An act established to decentralize the decision making process as it pertains to Philippine land and cultural artifacts. It was an effort to give a voice to communities by appointing local stakeholders who would collaborate with the national government. It required the national government to periodically consult with the appointed Local Government Units (LGU) before it could be allowed to implement any program within its jurisdiction, especially programs with potential to disrupt or disturb culturally important artifacts in their original state. = General Appropriations Act of 2015 =  (Republic Act No. 10651)  An act that made it the responsibility of the department of education to ‚Äúpreserve and restore the existing Gabaldon school buildings as part of the preservation of the country's cultural heritage‚Äù. Gabaldon school buildings were built in the Philippines during the American Colonial period and are considered to be of significant cultural value. The Gabaldon school buildings are also protected by Republic Act No. 10066 and Republic Act No. 11194. They made it illegal to demolish these buildings. = General Appropriations Act of 2016 =  (Republic Act No. 10717)  An act that added ‚Äúother heritage school buildings‚Äù to the list of things that the department of education was required to preserve and protect. It also required ‚Äúprior approval of government cultural agencies and proper consultation with stakeholders and cultural groups‚Äù in order to demolish cultural properties. These cultural properties included but were not limited to provincial capitol buildings, city hall, municipal hall, monuments, fountains, parks and plazas, state colleges and universities, lighthouses, bridges, public hospitals, train stations, museums, public libraries, stadiums, prisons and government offices. The act also held agencies responsible for structures such as roads and bridges which impacted heritage conservation when being built. = General Appropriations Act of 2017 =  (Republic Act No. 10924)  An act that referred to Republic Act No. 10066 and required agencies mentioned in it (National Parks Development Committee, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of Tourism, and more) to consult with the NCCA before carrying out their responsibilities. It also called for the protection of built heritage and cultural landscapes, including but not limited to provincial capitol buildings, city hall, municipal hall, monuments, fountains, parks and plazas, state colleges and universities, lighthouses, bridges, public hospitals, train stations, museums, public libraries, stadiums, prisons and government offices. It required approval of government cultural agencies, the NCCA, and stakeholders, to alter, renovate, or demolish important cultural properties. = Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Rights Act of 1997 =  (Republic Act No. 8371)  An act created to ‚Äúmakes provisions for the promotion and recognition of the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples, with a view to preserve their culture, traditions and institutions and to ensure the equal protection and non-discrimination of members.‚Äù It was intended to recognize, ‚Äúprotect and promote the rights of indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples, creating a national commission on indigenous peoples, establishing implementing mechanisms, appropriating funds therefor, and for other purposes.‚Äù = Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act =  (Republic Act No. 4846)  An act that required that anyone wishing to excavate would obtain written permission from the Director of the National Museum of the Philippines. It requires archaeologists supervising excavations to be certified by the Museum and requires archaeologists to catalogue their excavations and to halt digging when they find any artifacts, because any findings must be reported to the Museum Director. It required any digging on government or private property to be carried out by the Museum or a group authorized by the Museum.  Presidential Decrees  = Presidential Decree No. 105 = A law signed in 1973, \\"declaring national shrines as sacred places and prohibiting desecration thereof.‚Äù Presidential Decree No. 105 also designated ‚Äúcertain places in the country as National Shrines because they were the sites of the birth, exile, imprisonment, detention or death of great and eminent leaders of the nation‚Äù and puts pressure on the Philippine government to protect National Shrines as hallowed places. Convicted violators of Presidential Decree No. 105 are subject to 10 or more years' imprisonment, a fine of 10,000 or more pesos, or both, at the discretion of the court. = Presidential Decree No. 374 = A law signed in 1974, also known as the Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act, which created guidelines for the National Museum to follow when processing National Cultural Treasure. It required that \\"any cultural property exported or sold locally must be registered with the National Museum.\\" It defined a National Cultural Treasure as the following; \\"a unique object found locally, possessing outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value which is highly significant and important to [the Philippines].\\" = Presidential Decree No. 375 = A law that built upon Presidential Decree No. 374 and was also signed in 1974. This law added the Basilica of Taal, Church of Santa Maria, Barasoin Church, Tirad Pass, Miagao Church, the battle site of the Battle of Mactan, San Sebastian Church, and the Church of Santo Ni√±o to the list of National Cultural Treasures. = Presidential Decree No. 1505 = A law signed in 1978 which prohibited ‚Äúthe unauthorized modification, alteration, repair and destruction of original features of all national shrines, monuments, landmarks and other important historical edifices.\\" Presidential Decree No. 1505 also made it unlawful to ‚Äúmodify, alter, repair, or destroy‚Äù the natural state of national shrines, landmarks, and other sites deemed important by the National Historical Institute of the Philippines, without written consent of the chair of the Institute. Convicted violators of Presidential Decree No. 1505 are subject to anywhere between 1 and 5 years in prison or a fine between 1,000 and 10,000 pesos.  Other Agencies  = UNESCO = The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization functions to designate world heritage sites, which are places that hold outstanding universal value to humanity and humanity‚Äôs history. The title world heritage site provides protection since most of the statutes and laws regarding preservation of Philippine heritage give protection to UNESCO world heritage sites. Included in the list of World Heritage Sites in the Philippines are the rice terraces in the Cordilleras, and sites currently being considered for addition to the list are located in Butuan, the Cagayan Valley, and the Tabon Cave complex, where Tabon man was found. = The National Museum of the Philippines = The National Museum of the Philippines was given power by the National Museum Act of 1998, or Republic Act No. 8492. It was an act that cut the Museum‚Äôs ties to the NCCA and the Department of Education. It placed the Museum under the Office of the President only. The National Museum‚Äôs function is to ‚Äúobtain, keep, study and present material evidence of man and his environment‚Äù and ‚Äúinform the general public about these activities for the purpose of study, education and entertainment.\\" = National Commission for Culture and the Arts = The National Commission for Culture and the Arts is \\"the official government agency for culture in the Philippines.\\" It makes policies regarding, and gifts grants to, anything associated with the \\"preservation, development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture.\\" = Intramuros Administration = The Intramuros Administration was created under Presidential Decree No. 1616 with the mandate of ensuring the restoration and orderly development of Intramuros as a monument to the Hispanic era of Philippine History.The Intramuros Administration. The IA Charter = Heritage Conservation Society = The Heritage Conservation Society (HCS) is an organization which aims to protect and preserve built heritage and historical or cultural sites, to uphold that \\"heritage and culture should be developed and preserved for national identity.\\" HCS utilizes volunteerism and advocacy work to contribute to the preservation of Philippine built heritage, which is HCS's is primary concern. HCS defines conservation as \\"all the processes and measures of maintaining the cultural significance of a cultural property including, but not limited to, preservation, restoration, reconstruction, protection, adaptation or any combination thereof.\\"  Cultural ownership  Due to the nature of museums, their primary interest is not to advocate on behalf of cultural groups, but to collect items of cultural and historical significance. Therefore, artifacts found during excavations tend to end up with museums and organizations instead of being returned to the people with whom they belong. There are acts and laws that have been working to combat this problematic phenomenon around the world: * NAGPRA * Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Rights Act of 1997 * Indian Reorganization Act * Archaeological Resources Protection Act References Category:Philippine culture Category:Public archaeology ","title":"Heritage management in the Philippines"},{"id":"61934715","text":"Lorenzo Peli (born 24 January 2000) is an Italian football player.

Plot Don Gaspar (Domingo Soler), the owner of a prestigious sporting goods store, decides to hire a man (Cantinflas) as a salesman in his store, after seeing him play an American football game. When the man starts working in the store, he fails in many positions he is given, but Don Gaspar does not fire him despite the constant accusations of an employee of his who sees all the disasters he causes, and trusting that he is good for something. In the end, he degrades him to operator of the elevator, and later decides to send him to Acapulco to try to convince Jorge Maciel (Carlos Agost√≠), a famous professional athlete who will spend his vacation there, to sign an advertising contract that will give more prestige to Don Gaspar's company. Cantinflas, when traveling to Acapulco with his compadre and registering at the hotel, is mistaken by accident with Jorge Maciel himself by a millionaire woman named Lucy (Teresa Vel√°zquez), who is infatuated with him. After having won the affection of that woman he decides to maintain the falsehood despite knowing that the true Jorge Maciel will sooner or later arrive, so he has to compete in several sports categories, from which he wins all. The real Jorge Maciel arrives at the hotel and finds out what the man is doing, and although he knows that he is ursurping his identity, he decides not to unmask him because he wants to know who he is and what he wants. He stays with a false name and keeps an eye on the man all the time without being noticed. In the end, Lucy, very much in love with the fake Jorge Maciel, proposes that they live together far away. Shortly afterwards, the real Jorge Maciel reveals himself to the man and asks for an explanation, he explains that he was initially sent to try to obtain his signature, but upon meeting Lucy and falling in love with her, he decided to impersonate him to maintain that love since he was unable to tell her the truth. Maciel promises not to tell her the truth and forgives him for everything. However, a companion of Lucy (Alejandro Ciangherotti) discovers it by hearing all of their conversation in secret. The next morning, Lucy learns that the fake Jorge Maciel left the hotel at dawn without telling her anything, and her companion who discovered who he is offers to take her with him. The fake Jorge Maciel returns to the sporting goods store and Don Gaspar, very upset about failing the mission he entrusted to him, returns him to his elevator operator post to pay everything he spent on it; however, afterwards Jorge Maciel voluntarily goes to the store and presents himself to Don Gaspar to tells him that he will sign the document, only in return for the happiness of the person sent to achieve that purpose. Lucy and her companion arrive at the sporting goods store, and seeing that her hero was nothing more than an elevator operator, she leaves very angry and disappointed. Just as the man is about to leave heartbroken, Don Gaspar appoints him general manager of the store for having won the contract with Jorge Maciel. In the end, the man, as general manager of the company, reconciles with Lucy.

He was born and educated in Berlin, Germany, and later died in Northampton, Massachusetts from Coronary thrombosis. He was influenced by his maternal uncle, a biologist, to pursue science. He had many interests including visual perception, brain damage, sound localization, developmental psychology, and experimental psychology. He worked alongside Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang K√∂hler to develop Gestalt psychology. Koffka had several publications including \\"The Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology\\" (1924) and \\"The Principles of Gestalt Psychology\\" (1935) which elaborated on his research.  Personal life  Kurt Koffka, born March 18, 1886 in Berlin, Germany, was raised by Luis Levy and Emil Koffka. His mother listed herself as Protestant despite having a Jewish heritage. His father was a lawyer and his younger brother, Friedrich Koffka, went on to become a judge. In spite of the prevalence of law in his family, Kurt Koffka decided to pursue science as he was motivated by his maternal uncle who was a biologist. Koffka married Mira Klein, a participant in his experimental research, in 1909, but they later divorced. In 1923, he married Elisabeth Ahlgrimm who completed her Ph.D at Giessen, but they divorced in 1926. He remarried Mira until their second divorce in 1928 when he remarried Elisabeth whom he remained married to until his death. Koffka was forced to alter his lifestyle after developing a heart condition called Coronary thrombosis. However, his condition did not hamper his work ethic as his lecturing and scientific projects occupied his time until he died. Koffka died on November 22, 1941, in Northampton, Massachusetts and left many of his projects unfinished.  Education  Kurt Koffka's academic career began at the school of Wilhelmsgymnasium where he attended from 1892 to 1903. In 1903, Kurt Koffka traveled to Scotland to study at the University of Edinburgh for a year. His time at the University of Edinburgh was crucial as he developed a greater understanding of the English language which was a valuable tool for spreading his message in the future. In 1904, he returned to Berlin where he attended the University of Berlin for three years. He chose to pursue psychology as he believed the subject matter of psychology was best suited towards his interests. While studying at the University of Berlin, Koffka examined his personal colour vision in Willibald Nagel‚Äôs physiological laboratory. He was interested in visual perception due to his own red-green blindness, which led him to study color vision and after- images.Wesley, F. (2002). Koffka Kurt. In N. Sheehy, A. J. Chapman, & W. A. Conroy (Eds.), In Biographical Dictionary of Psychology (pp. 329-30). London, UK: Routledge. Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/koffka_kurt_1886_1941. This work culminated in Koffka‚Äôs first publication in 1908 called Untersuchungen an einem protanomalen System. This paper analyzed different properties of colour including contrast as well as the effect of brightness and wavelengths on colour. The figure ground phenomenon was also studied. Koffka completed his dissertation called Experimental-Untersuchungen zur Lehre von Rhythmus securing him his Doctor of Philosophy in 1908. He worked with Carl Stumpf during the pursuit of his doctorate.  Career  After receiving his doctorate in 1908, Koffka worked at the University of W√ºrzburg as an assistant to Oswald K√ºlpe who greatly influenced his work. After Kulpe left, Koffka continued to work as an assistant to Karl Marbe.Harrower-Erickson, M.R. (1942). Kurt Koffka, 1886-1941. The American Journal of Psychology, 55(2). 278-281. In 1910, Koffka became an assistant to Friedrich Schumann at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt on Main to study the perception of motion, alongside Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang K√∂hler. Koffka considered this period in his life significant to his scientific development. Koffka later became a professor at the University of Giessen. The University of Giessen assigned Koffka the Privatdozent title in 1911 and the ausserordentlicher while working with August Messer. Eighteen articles and six experimental works were completed over the twelve years that Koffka spent at Giessen. Koffka spent time at Professor Sommer‚Äôs Psychiatric Clinic located in Giessen in the midst of World War I. They focused on subjects diagnosed with brain trauma, but focused on aphasia cases. He also studied the localization of sounds to be of aid to the army and navy. In 1924, Koffka moved to the United States of America and retained a research professor position at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, beginning in 1927. His priority during this time was work regarding visual perception. In 1932, Uzbekistan was undergoing significant socioeconomic and political changes. It was at this time that Koffka traveled to Uzbekistan to join others in researching the impact of these changes on affected individuals cognition. His work did not result in any publications. However, while in Uzbekistan, an illness, diagnosed as relapsing fever, rendered Koffka very ill but, in spite of his condition, he began to work on his book, \\"The Principles of Gestalt Psychology\\", which was published in 1935. Once this book was completed, Koffka‚Äôs previous self- limitations were eased as he allowed himself to delve into areas he previously felt were inappropriate for his specialty. This broadened scope was evidenced by his incorporation of psychology in other fields of interest including the arts and ethics. He spent the year 1939-1940 visiting Sir Hugh Cairns at the Nuffield Institute in Oxford.  Contributions to psychology  = Learning = The Gestalt principle of proxmity The Gestalt principle of similarity Koffka believed that most of early learning is what he referred to as, \\"sensorimotor learning,\\" which is a type of learning which occurs after a consequence. For example, a child who touches a hot stove will learn not to touch it again. Koffka also believed that a lot of learning occurs by imitation, though he argued that it is not necessary to understand how imitation works, but rather to acknowledge that it is a natural occurrence. According to Koffka, the highest type of learning is ideational learning, which makes use of language. Koffka notes that a crucial time in children's development is when they understand that objects have names. = Gestalt psychology = Koffka gained his initial interest in Gestalt psychology after participating in Wertheimer‚Äôs phi phenomenon study. In 1910, Kurt Koffka worked alongside Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang K√∂hler at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt. They focused their research on sensory information and memory, and later became the founding fathers of Gestalt psychology. Max Wertheimer is often credited with developing the idea of Gestalt psychology, but they were influenced by Christian von Ehrenfel's idea that a holistic melody is more than a simple combination of various sounds. This later becomes essential to theories of Gestalt psychology which convey that complete perception is more meaningful than its individual parts put together. The Gestalt Principles were developed to delve into how the human eye perceives visual elements. The principles help to provide ways to understand how complex visual elements can be broken down into simpler parts. The principles also try to demonstrate how the human eye perceives shapes as a single ‚Äúobject‚Äù instead of splitting the object into simplified components of the object being seen.Arnheim, R. (1986). The two faces of gestalt psychology. American Psychologist, 41(7). 820-824. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.41.7.820 Some of the most commonly used principles were proximity, similarity, and continuation. Gestalt principle of proximity discussed that visual elements close to one another will be perceived as a whole.Verlaers, K., Wagemans, J., & Overvliet, K. (2015). The effect of perceptual grouping on haptic numerosity perception. Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 77(1). 353-367. doi:10.3758/s13414-014-0770-8 Gestalt principle of similarity establishes that people tend to categorize objects that share the same traits into a group. Gestalt principle of continuity reveals how people perceive lines or curves as a whole if they ‚Äútouch‚Äù one another. Koffka needed to provide empirical evidence for the new theory. To accomplish this, Koffka formulated a three stage proposition that revolutionized existing assumptions of psychology:Kohler, W. (1942). Kurt Koffka, 1886-1941. Psychological Review, 49(2). 97-101. doi:10.1037/h0054684 # Perceiving sensory experiences as a combination of individual parts does not align with the actual experience of perception. The school of Gestalt suggests that human sensory experience be viewed as a whole since wholes are more meaningful than the sum of its parts. # It is a mistake to correlate a stimulus with sensation because functionality of a stimulus must be paired with factual information. Stimuli should be correlated to factual content of the perceptive field. # The previous two premises hold that the relationship between the psyche and physical needs to be reconsidered. In 1922, Kurt Koffka published an article called \\"Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-Theorie\\" in the Psychological Bulletin to introduce Gestalt psychology to the American academics. The article focused on describing how Gestalt psychology studies various perceptual phenomena using different theories from existing ones. After its publication, it led to the criticisms of Gestalt psychology that it was overly focused on perception, and lacked contribution to overall themes of psychology. = Aesthetic Gestalt (1940) = In 1940, Kurf Koffka traveled to Philadelphia and attended a conference at Bryn Mawr which brought together many different well-known figures from different fields of study to approach art from different perspectives.Spehar, B., van Tonder, G. J. (2017). Koffka‚Äôs aesthetic gestalt. Leonardo, 50(1). 53-57 Retrieved from https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/647700. At the time, many subjects such as culture, ecology, evolution, emotion, psychology, knowledge, physiology had been treated as their own independent fields with no connection to one another. Kurt Koffka attempted to make a multidisciplinary theory of art known as Aesthetic of Gestalt. Koffka‚Äôs presentation at the conference advanced the scientific theory of art, but it is a neglected theory that has mostly been forgotten after its publication. The main focus in Aesthetic theory is the appreciation of beauty in art pieces. There are 3 components in the relationship: the self (the spectator), the extraordinary art piece, and the connection between the two. Aesthetic of Gestalt illustrates that the self (the individual) sees that there is an important message when observing the art piece. Koffka Identifies three problems with the aesthetic experience. The first is contingency. While behaviourists believe that art naturally evokes an emotional response, Koffka argued that the previous associations must exist to understand that redness for example means passion. This previous association is a rational and intelligible interaction that draws on a look-up table, not blindly resorting to the look-up table. The second problem is with the empathy-based art theories about aesthetic and how the fact that people put their own emotions onto the art piece is paradoxical. In order for an art piece to be appreciated the self must first recognize the emotion they must attribute to the piece. The third problem is that empathy logic implies that emotions projected by the self onto the art piece are to be felt by others. However, just because the person perceives that red is passionate does not mean they are feeling the same passion themselves. Honours In 2006, members of the Department of Psychology of Justus Liebig University Giessen founded the Kurt-Koffka medal to honour scientists who have made extraordinary advances to the fields of perception or developmental psychology.  Publications  = \\"Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-theorie\\" (1922) = In 1922, Kurt Koffka published an article called \\"Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt-Theorie\\" in the Psychological Bulletin to introduce Gestalt psychology to the American academics. The article focused on how Gestalt psychology describes three main points which are sensation, association and attention with a different scope than other existing theories. Sensation puts forward the idea of the \\"bundle- hypothesis\\" which means that the world is made up of elements that come together to create stimuli in our world. The second listed concept of association is acknowledged by Koffka as the primary factor that decides what is coming and going in regards to our ideas. It is association that puts one idea forward over another idea in our train of thought and ties all those separate elemental ideas together. The final point of attention is described as a \\"scapegoat\\" by Koffka. If one's attention fails to notice a stimuli then the correlated response to that stimuli will not happen, even though the stimuli is present. After its publication, Koffka's article led to the criticisms that gestalt psychology it was overly focused on perception, and lacked contribution to overall themes of psychology. = The Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology (1924) = One of Koffka‚Äôs most notable contributions to psychology was his book entitled, ‚ÄúThe Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology\\". The english translation of this book was done by Robert M. Ogden. Koffka had two main goals in writing this book. His first goal was to utilize Gestalt principles to present an innovative view of childhood phenomenon. His second goal was to provide educators with an up to date resource in order to facilitate effective teaching. In this book, Koffka focused on mind development in children and outlined four ways in which development occurs. Firstly, he stated physical movements must become more advanced and precise as children grow older. As infants, we begin with rudimentary motor skills and with development we can engage in more complex physical activities. Secondly, he believed infants must develop their sensory integration skills and learn to become effective perceivers of their environment. Thirdly, Koffka stated that children must utilize their motor and sensory systems as they are dependent on each other to create a coherent whole which is utilized to facilitate appropriate behaviour. Lastly, Koffka thought children must learn to rely on their cognition when acting as opposed to their impulses. = The Principles of Gestalt Psychology (1935) = This book addressed applied psychology but mainly focused on the research concerning perception, memory, and learning. Koffka published this book in 1935 and it changed the basic ideas within research involving perception. Veridical perception states that objects people see in the environment will have relatively consistent characteristics such as size, and color. Before this book was published, researchers had assumed that there was no need to explain the features of veridical perception. Koffka rejected the idea that researchers should only focus on illusions within people's perception, because he thought it was always necessary to understand why people perceive objects the way that they do. This book approaches the topic of veridical perception in a phenomenological and holistic manner that supported the Gestalt Principles as well as other research that supported the Gestalt orientation. This work also explored the notion of behavioural environments. A person's behaviour can result from one's own behavioural environment or another person's behavioural environment. This means that someone can see and understand their actions one way and another person could see the same actions and understand them completely differently. Psychologists need to be mindful to view an individual's behaviour from the other individual's behavioural environment rather than their own.

His father, a Methodist minister, was also born in South Carolina while his mother came from Pennsylvania. On June 12, 1935, he and his wife, Gheretein Ridgeley, were married in Washington, D.C. They had one son, Dwight Hillis Wilson Jr.  Career  Wilson earned his degrees from Kittrell College, Shaw University, and Howard College (now University). For his master's thesis, the subject was \\"Shelley as Revolutionist.\\" He was also awarded with a Doctor of Letters degree from Allen University in 1939. On May 9, 1931, Wilson and 8 others were inducted into the Pearl of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity as Neophytes. After his schooling, he taught at Morris Brown College from 1935-1936, before becoming the first archivist of Fisk University. After World War II, he was a member of the Allied Force Records Administration and worked in Caserta and Rome. His colleague, Ken Manden, recalled that Wilson was courageous and \\"always held his own‚Äîno mean feat for any archivist under such circumstances but, if I may say so, a remarkable one for an American Negro confronting what may have seemed to him to be a devious politico-military cabal.\\" He was also a prominent member of the Society of American Archivists and served as Chair on the Committee on College and University Archives. He was the first African American to chair an SAA Committee. In 1949, Wilson was awarded the Certificate of Recognition of the National Urban League for \\"outstanding achievement in archival work.\\" Wilson wrote several articles for books and journals throughout his life, especially The American Archivist.

Raised in November/December 1878 the unit served throughout the war of 1879 to provide engineering support to the British invasion of Zululand. Three companies were formed each comprising around 100 men and clad in old British Army uniforms. The units served at the battles of Isandlwana, Eshowe and Ulundi.  Background  The British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Henry Bartle Frere had been attempting to form a confederation of British possessions in Southern Africa. As part of this ambition the annexation of Zululand was planned, this led to the Anglo- Zulu War of 1879. As part of preparations for this war the British military commander Frederic Thesiger (later and more commonly known as Lord Chelmsford) began gathering forces in the Colony of Natal for an invasion of Zululand. Chelmsford's plan called for an invasion by five columns of troops, though manpower shortages required him to reduce this to three. The Right Column (formerly No. 1 Column) under Charles Pearson advanced on the eastern coast, the Left Column (formerly No. 4 Column) under Evelyn Wood was to launch a feint on the west flank and Chelmsford's Centre Column (comprising the former Nos. 2 & 3 Columns) struck for the Zulu capital at Ulundi. The former No. 5 Column under Hugh Rowlands was assigned to defend the Natal border. The columns would need to march along existing tracks in Zululand and all supplies would need to follow them by wagon. These tracks were ill-formed and only used occasionally by traders. They turned to quagmires in the rain and were occasionally broken by steep sided dongas (dry river beds). River fords (locally known as drifts) were impassable in high water and quickly ruined when trafficked heavily. Engineering teams would be necessary to maintain the tracks and drifts to allow the columns to pass through and supplies to reach the troops.  Formation  Chelmsford, guided by the commander of No. 2 Column Anthony Durnford - a seasoned South African campaigner, raised a force of pioneers from the black subjects of Natal. This was a development of the Natal government's isiBhalo levy system by which for years men had been pressed into duty to carry out road repairs. Durnford took the best men from the Natal Native Contingent (NNC), which had been raised as an auxiliary fighting force, to form the Natal Pioneers. Three companies were raised, with a nominal strength of 5 white officers, 4 black officers and 96 men (though only No. 2 Company reached this strength). It had originally been intended that each company would be commanded by a regular British Army officer of the Royal Engineers but there were too few to spare and Durnford had to turn to the Natal government to supply suitable men. The Natal Colony also supplied the equipment for the troops: each man was provided with a pickaxe, shovel or crowbar and the non-commissioned officers were issued with a rifle. The men were issued uniforms of cast-off pre-1872 British Army issue red frock jackets; these were the traditional red coats but with the cuff facings and collar removed (these were coloured to identify individual British Army regiments). The Natal Pioneers were also issued knee-length white canvas trousers, a blue pillbox hand with a yellow band and a British Army greatcoat. Durnford had intended that the entire NNC would be similarly uniformed but a lack of supply left them to make do with only a red rag tied around the head as an identifying badge. The Natal Pioneers were raised in November and December 1878. They served throughout the war of the following year and were disbanded in October 1879, after the Zulu capitulation.  No. 1 Company  Depiction of a corduroy road No. 1 Company was commanded by Lieutenant J Nolan and numbered 80 men. The unit was assigned to Chelmsford's Centre Column for the invasion and were put to use almost immediately after the initial crossing of the Buffalo River into Zululand at Rorke's Drift on 11 January. The marshy ground around the Bashee River proved impassable to Chelmsford's wagon train and Nolan's Pioneers were called into action to construct a corduroy road. At the camp at Isandlwana the company occupied a position adjacent to the road that ran through the southern portion of the British position. They were intended to provide protection to the road and at night mounted a special guard detail over it. Chelmsford left the camp with around half his troops on the morning of 22 January 1879 to conduct a recognisance in force around the Mangeni Falls, where elements of the Zulu army had been spotted. Nolan and the majority of No. 1 Company joined this force to help clear the road for the artillery and assist in the crossing of several dongas on the route. A small detail of one officer and ten men was left behind at the camp where it was caught up in the disastrous British defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana later the same day. The interior of the British square at Ulundi The remainder of Nolan's company returned from the Mangeni and later served with Wood's Left Column. During the second invasion of Zululand later in the year it was assigned to Wood's Flying Column. Nolan, who had by then been promoted to captain, and his company fought in the British victory at the Battle of Ulundi on 4 July, the final pitched battle of the war. His forces by then amounted to 4 officers and 46 men, together with 4 horses. The company, was positioned in the centre of the British square at Ulundi and suffered no losses bar Lieutenants Hickley and Andrews who were wounded in action.  No. 2 Company  The crossing of the Amatakulu drift No. 2 Company was commanded by Captain Beddoes and comprised 104 men, being the only company of the Natal Pioneers to ever reach full strength. The company was assigned to Pearson's Right Column and worked in the vanguard, preparing the road ahead of the column's advance. On 20 January 1879 the company, together with two companies of The Buffs, worked to create a crossing of the Amatakulu River. During this time Lieutenant Main commanded the unit and was mentioned in dispatches to the British House of Commons for the role he played in repairing the tracks ahead of the column. Half of the company was besieged at the mission station of Eshowe from January to April 1879. The men distinguished themselves in the battle, carrying out scouting work as well as their regular engineering duties. The pioneers were renowned for venturing out of the settlement to gather mealie (maize) and pumpkins which they sold to the other defenders; despite being fired upon repeatedly by the besieging Zulu none of the pioneers were killed.  No. 3 Company  No. 3 Company under Captain Allen consisted of 80 men and served with Durnford's Column. It may have been wiped out alongside the rest of Durnford's command at Isandlwana.

Work and reception Critics note Zlamany's portraiture for its conceptual slant, postmodern interrogations of the male gaze, traditional subject matter, beauty and representation, and Old Master technique. John Yau and others connect her work, in sensibility if not style, back to figurative modernists such as Alice Neel, Otto Dix and Ivan Albright, contemporary painters like Vija Celmins, Chuck Close, Gregory Gillespie and Alex Katz that integrate elements of abstraction into representational work, and postmodern artists such as John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton and Lisa Yuskavage who have ushered in new, critical and democratic forms of portraiture in recent decades.Finkelstein, Alix. \\"New Directions in Children‚Äôs Portraiture,\\" Fine Art Connoisseur, November-December 2009, p. 39‚Äì42.Grant, Daniel. \\"The Modern Portrait: Is It Worth the Price to Get Yourself Painted?\\" Observer, May 9, 2018.

Brenda Zlamany, Shark Head #2, oil on panel, 18\\" x 14\\", 1992. =Early animal still lifes= Zlamany first attracted notice for meticulously rendered paintings of animal carcasses (birds, blowfish, snakes, sharks, iguanas), isolated and floating ambiguously in dark, painterly abstract fields (e.g., Shark Head #2, 1992). She began this work in the mid-1980s as a way to connect to visceral experience and elements of art practice‚Äîpainting, craft, beauty‚Äîthat she felt women were discouraged from pursuing. Reviewers noted her mastery of academic glazing techniques, delicate sense of color and texture, and paint application suggestive of both Old Master and Abstract Expressionist technique;The New Yorker. \\"Brenda Zlamany,\\" The New Yorker , December 21, 1998, p. 16, 18. in psychological terms, they described the paintings as \\"disquietingly seductive,\\"Condon, Elisabeth. \\"Small, Really Small, Tiny,\\" New Art Examiner, March 1993, p. 32‚Äì3. vaguely allegorical, icon-like contemplations of life, death, desire and spirituality.Sweet, Christopher.

Janine Cirincione wrote that they \\"teeter on the edge of abstraction and representation, old master bravura and postmodern theory, between the seductive and the gruesome,\\" with freewheeling art historical borrowings that challenged both traditional pictorial values and contemporary negations of representational work. Barry Schwabsky likewise noted the work's conceptual preference for investigating materiality and illusionism and art's \\"half-feared, half-desired\\" fascination with representation and beauty over realism. In a later series, Zlamany painted posed, live snakes that emphasized linear decoration, pattern and male sexuality while subverting traditional cultural associations of snakes with the feminine. Brenda Zlamany, Self- Portrait with Benedict and Oxfordshire, oil on panel, 26\\" x 17\\", 1998. =Portraiture= In 1992, Zlamany painted her first human portrait and exhibited it alongside animal still lifes, interested in how the out-of- fashion genre would be received.

They emphasized the minimal nature of Zlamany's work, which had long eschewed architecture and landscape elements and iconographic cues in favor of composition, proportion, ground color and manner of representation as means of conveying narrative or psychological content. During this time, Zlamany also produced portraits of artists Leonardo Drew, David Humphrey, David Hockney, and Alex Katz among others; the latter two were National Portrait Gallery competition selections. In 1998, Zlamany painted portraits of her pregnant sister and two sets of self-portraits, one nude and one in profiled poses recalling works by della Francesca; her 2007 show \\"Facing Family\\" featured portraits of her parents and daughter.Schwabsky, Barry. \\"The Rustle of Painting,\\" Lacanian Ink, Volume 9, 1995, p. 47‚Äì57; also in The Widening Circle: Consequences of Modernism in Contemporary Art, Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

This style was used by other potteries, in Yorkshire, Staffordshire, and probably elsewhere, and the tendency in recent decades is to call pieces that are not marked (the great majority) Castleford-type wares. These were made by several potteries in the same period.Godden, xxiii; Fitzwilliam The Castleford Pottery depended largely on exports to Europe, especially the Baltic, and apparently owned its own ships. Like other English potteries, the disruption to trade from the Napoleonic Wars was a blow from which it never recovered.Jewitt, 485‚Äì486; \\"Castleford potteries\\", Wakefield Council The works, on what is now Pottery Street, Castleford, had been a pottery under previous owners since about 1770,Rickard, Jonathan, Barker, David, Mocha and Related Dipped Wares, 1770‚Äì1939, 140, 2006, UPNE, , 9781584655138, google books and continued to be so after the sale by Dunderdale in 1820. It is claimed that the same premises operated as a pottery from c. 1770 until the last business, Clokie & Co, closed in 1961.\\"Castleford potteries\\", Wakefield Council; Jewitt, 488‚Äì489, describes (without much appreciation) the wares made by \\"Clokie and Masterson\\" when he was writing in 1878. Wakefield Museum have many pieces online, especially 20th century ones. The \\"Pottery River\\", an ox- bow branch of the River Calder, gave easy access to barges. The sculptor Henry Moore, who came from Castleford, attended pottery painting classes in the town in the 1920s.Castleford Museum, Item B1.519 Castleford-type Castleford- type sugar bowl, 1790‚Äì1810 The teapots often have a straight-sided octagonal shape, imitating designs in silver. The reliefs follow the general artistic taste of the period, with mild Neoclassicism shading into Romanticism. The lids of the teapots are often either hinged, or slide out to the rear, the lid piece including a section of the \\"gallery\\" or border around the top hole in the pot.Fitzwilliam; Godden, xxiii; Wood, 14 Sowter & Co of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and Chetham & Woolley of Longton, Staffordshire, in The Potteries, were two of the other potteries that made Castleford-type wares. The number \\"22\\" is often impressed on the base of otherwise unmarked pots, and this has been associated with Sowter & Co.Fitzwilliam; example covered is probably by Sowter & Co. \\"Basalt ware\\" teapots and other large teaware items are the other main type of object associated with Dunderdale's Castleford Pottery. These, also made elsewhere, are in a similar style (without enamel) and sometimes both types are found from the same moulds.Wood, 14; Jewitt, 488 They also made pearlware of good quality, some of which was transfer-printed in ornate designs in the style which was becoming popular after 1800.Jewitt, 488; Wakefield Museum, Item Cas.222 Chessmen, 1800‚Äì1810, probably Castleford Unlike Wedgwood's Jasperware and other types, where the reliefs were made separately and applied, in Castleford-type wares the reliefs were carried in the moulds, into which the clay was pressed, with two mould for the halves of the main body, the handle being joined later.Fitzwilliam; Godden, xxiii Marks Most pieces are unmarked, but some have impressed marks on the base of \\"DD CASTLEFORD\\" until 1803, when David Dunderdale took John Plowes as a partner. Thereafter \\"DD & CO CASTLEFORD\\" or \\"DD & CO CASTLEFORD POTTERY\\" were used.Hughes, 221-22; Godden, xxiii Background Although Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire was by this period much the most important pottery centre in England, there were other areas with significant groups of potteries. Yorkshire, with good clay and coal from nearby, had several, most importantly Leeds Pottery; many made stoneware.Wood, 13‚Äì16 Teapots and coffee pots, made without the cups needed to serve tea, had always been a staple of British stoneware since the Dutch Elers brothers began British stoneware in around 1690. Starting in London, they moved to Staffordshire and were much imitated in the area. They usually added small relief elements to teapots, but these were generally plant motifs, either Chinese or Western in style.Godden, xiii‚Äìxiv; Wood, 3 By about the 1740s Staffordshire potters were making teapots with bolder relief designs, in particular those shaped as camels, in a creamy salt glazed stoneware.Hughes, 75‚Äì78; Godden, xiv‚Äìxv These were rather crude in design, but much more refined stonewares, still very often using relief decoration, were produced by Wedgwood from the 1760s onwards, soon followed by their many imitators. In particular Josiah Wedgwood greatly improved the existing black or dark brown stoneware called \\"Egyptian black\\", which he renamed \\"Black Basaltes\\" when he perfected his version in 1769. This type is now called \\"black basalt\\" or \\"basalt ware\\". It was also popular for teapots, supposedly because it showed off by contrast the white hands of the hostess as she poured tea.Hughes, 47‚Äì50; Godden, xix The Castleford Pottery was one of many imitators of basalt wares, which derived their colour from manganese and iron added to the body mixture.Godden, xix File:Camel teapot, Staffordshire, England, c. 1750, earthenware, mold-cast and salt-glazed - Krannert Art Museum, UIUC - DSC06663.jpg\\"Camel\\" stoneware teapot, Staffordshire, c. 1750 File:Teapot And Cover, ca. 1785 (CH 18349623) (cropped).jpgTurner factory, stoneware, c. 1785, antedating the Castleford Pottery File:DAR pot - IMG 8641.JPGEarly Castleford ware commemorative teapot, dated 1792, pearlware File:Castleford ware teapot, basalt ware, c. 1785, Dayton Art Institute.JPGCastleford ware teapot, basalt ware Notes References *\\"Fitzwilliam\\": \\"Blue lined 'Castleford-type' teapot, sliding cover\\", Fitzwilliam Museum *Godden, Geoffrey, An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of British Pottery and Porcelain, 1992, Magna Books, *Hughes, G Bernard, The Country Life Pocket Book of China, 1965, Country Life Ltd *Jewitt, Llewellynn F.

FtsK stands for \\" _F_ ilament _t_ emperature _s_ ensitive mutant K\\" because at high temperatures the mutant bacterial cell fails to divide and long filaments develop instead. FtsK, and specifically its C-domain, functions as DNA pump, interacts with other cell division proteins, and intervenes in the regulation of the Xer recombination process. FtsK belongs to the AAA (ATPase Associated with various cellular Activities) superfamily and is present in most bacteria.  Structure  FtsK is a transmembrane protein composed of three domains: FtsKN, FtsKL, and FtsKC. Through its N- domain and C-domain FtsK works to coordinate cell division and chromosome differentiation. The FtsKN domain is embedded in the cellular membrane by four transmembrane Œ±-helices. The FtsKL domain extends from the membrane into the cytoplasm. This linking domain varies in length across many bacteria. Found at the cytoplasmic end of the linker domain, the FtsKC segment of the protein is responsible for enabling the activity of the Xer recombination system upon the formation of a chromosome dimer. Additionally, the FtsKC domain is composed of three subdomains: Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥. The Œ± and Œ≤ subunits aggregate to form a hexamer that possesses the ability to translocate DNA through ATP hydrolysis. The ATP hydrolysis sites are found on the Œ≤ subunits of the hexamer. The Œ≥ domain is responsible for the control of the hexamer. It mediates the attachment of the hexamer to double-stranded DNA, controls the directionality of the translocase, and initiates chromosome dimer segregation.  Mechanism of Action  = The dif Site = The dif site is found at the intersection between the monomers of the chromosome dimer. It corresponds to where chromosomal replication ceased and is also the site of Xer mediated segregation. Translocation of the FtsKC hexamer stops when it reaches the location of the Xer recombinase complex that is associated with the dif site. = Binding Site = Guanosine rich areas of DNA, which are found at the ends of the dif region, are the sites of translocation initiation. These sites are referred to as KOPS motifs. Upon binding a KOPS motif, the FtsK hexamer forms and proceeds towards the dif region. Movement toward the dif region is facilitated by the polarity of the KOPS motif. = Translocation = There are three proposed mechanisms of DNA translocation: the rotary inchworm, the staircase, and the revolution mechanism. The rotary inchworm mechanism involves two points of contact between DNA and the subunits of the FtsKC hexamer. These points of contact correspond to an Œ± and a Œ≤ domain. A conformational change in the Œ± subunit can cause the DNA to shift. This shift is followed by a conformational change in the Œ≤ subunit (which also causes the DNA to move). The repeated conformational changes lead to the translocation of DNA. Conversely, the staircase mechanism sees the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits of the hexamer interacting with the double-stranded DNA in a sequential and overlapping manner. Conformational changes in each subunit cause movement in the spatial position of the DNA strand. Additionally, the revolution mechanism entails the passing of DNA through a channel formed by the hexameric FtsKC domain. In general, the chromosome dimer is translocated so that the site of resolution is near the divisome and so one copy of the genetic material ends up in each daughter cell. FtsK is the fastest DNA translocation pump, with rates of up to 7 kb s‚àí1 it is also a very efficient one. = Recombinase (Xer D) Activation = During bacterial replication, in the presence of a dimer the XerCD mechanism is introduced to divide the dimer into two monomers. FtsK is responsible for the activity of the Xer recombination reaction. Specifically, FtsKc is summoned if a chromosome dimer is present at the mid-cell point. The Xer mechanism is activated by overexpression of FtsK, therefore it appears that FtsK activates the Xer recombination. FtsK turns on the activity of XerCD upon expenditure of ATP. The recombination apparatus is made up of four monomers, two being Xer D and two being Xer C, that belong to a family of tyrosine recombinases. The interaction of Xer D and the Œ≥ subunit of FtsKC results in the activation of the recombinase. Contact between Xer D and the Œ≥ subunit is facilitated by the translocation of DNA. Specifically, translocation stops when the FtsKc hexamer reaches the dif site.  Role in Cell Division  FtsK has been shown to be a part of the divisome of bacteria and couple cell division with the resolution of dimers. FtsKN is thought to both stabilize the septum and aid in the recruitment of other proteins to the site of cell division. Recent research has shed light on the role of FtsK in membrane synthesis and has discovered that the L-domain is also important in the building of the septum. There is evidence to suggest that the N terminus is not the only part of FtsK that is involved in cell division. In an experiment done by Dubarry, a suppressor mutation allowed the cells to survive without FtsKN. Parts of FtsK were linked to integral membrane proteins. Subsequently, only those proteins that contained the linker region were able to restore normal cell growth, thus providing convincing evidence that the linker region of FtsK plays an important role in cell division. Other studies have shown that part of the FtsKN domain (which is in the periplasm) is involved in the construction of the cell wall.  Phylogeny  FtsK is part of the AAA motor ATPases. The phylogeny tree of FtsK ties back to the split between ssDNA and dsDNA translocases where TraB, FtsK, T4CPs and VirB4s arise. Each of these show structural similarities and the parent branch of FtsK arose along with other branches of TraB, TcpA, and FtsK. Although FtsK has its own phylogeny specifications and branches within, TraB is similar to a sister protein branch that can trace back to the timeline of FtsK. A common protein that derives from one of the phylogeny branches of FtsK is SpoIIIE which is essential during chromosome segregation. FtsK is found in most bacteria including E. coli , Staphyloccus, and Streptomycetes and in a select amount of Archaea and the phylogenetic tree is similar to that of bacteria. However the difficulty within exact dating of the diversification within its phylogeny is that proteins have variety in their branch lengths which makes it difficult to follow an exact timeline. The phylogeny of FtsK can therefore be compared to the time that protein groups VirB4/VirD4 diversified and slightly earlier than TraB and TcpA as they only occur in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes.

Their senior team play in the Leinster Senior League Senior Division. They also regularly compete in the FAI Cup, the FAI Intermediate Cup, the FAI Junior Cup and the Leinster Senior Cup. History St. Mochta's were founded in September 1949 when founder Barth O'Brien put a motion to the AGM of the St. Mochta's Branch of the Catholic Young Men's Society (CYMS) that a football section be formed within the branch. At the time, it was unsure exactly what type of football the club would play, considering that it could mean association football, rugby football, or gaelic football . After a vote from aspiring members, association football or soccer was chosen. In its early years, the club played its football at Somerton on the same grounds where Castleknock GAA club now play and briefly in Coolmine Lane, close to Coolmine railway station before permanently establishing themselves at Porterstown. In the early 1960s the CYMS became defunct but the club carried on as St. Mochta's. Recent Years In 2017 the club won the Leinster Senior League Senior Division for the first time. In October 2018, the Football Association of Ireland announced that St. Mochta's would be receiving ‚Ç¨20,000 in funds to help fund a full-sized astroturf pitch at the club's Porterstown Road facility.

According to its National Register nomination, the barn \\"is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a four-crib log barn representing late nineteenth- century and early twentieth-century farming and ranching in the Chickasaw Nation and Oklahoma between 1895 and 1950. The use of square-notching, which is a simpler technique associated with the waning of log construction proficiency, supports a late nineteenth-century construction date. After 1950 agriculture in Oklahoma had become largely mechanized and began to intensify and specialize enough that general-purpose barns, especially log barns, became increasingly obsolete. Unlike frame-constructed barns, log barns could not be easily electrified or plumbed, and they were essentially useless for storing machinery. The James H. Bounds Barn was never modernized, but it did remain in use for hay storage until the late 1980s.\\" Includes nine photos from 2012.

Remache has worked at the Federal Reserve of New York since 2000, where she held several positions before being promoted to Senior VP in February 2015. She briefly worked in the private sector between 2008-2009, but returned to the Federal Reserve in January 2009 as Director for Portfolio Analytics. In this position, Remache was part of a team responsible for buying $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as part of the Federal Reserve's MBS purchase program during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Education  Remache obtained her bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics at Boston University. Remache then went on to complete a master's in Economics at Boston University as well. She holds a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification.  Career  Remache joined the Federal Reserve of New York in 2000 as a trader and analyst. In January 2008 she was promoted to Markets Officer but shortly after, in March 2008, she took a job at Robeco-Sage Capital Management as Vice President. After nine months at Robeco-Sage, Richard Dzina, senior VP at the New York Fed, offered her a new position at the Bank. Remache accepted the position and returned to the Bank in January 2009, where she was responsible for developing and implementing the Federal Reserve's MBS purchase program. In January 2010 she was promoted to Assistant Vice President of the Markets Groups. In February 2015 she was promoted to her current position of Senior Vice President in the Markets Group. In 2011, Remache appeared on The Invention of Money episode of NPR's This American Life, where she discussed how, starting in November 2008, her Domestic Capital Markets team at the Federal Reserve injected $1.35 trillion dollars into the economy by purchasing mortgage-backed securities. In July 2015 she presented on monetary policy at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) 16th annual Economic Measurement Conference in Washington D.C. In May 2016 she organised a conference at Columbia University on the topic of the implementation of monetary policy post-2008 financial crisis.  Select research  Remache's research primarily focuses on the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases (otherwise known as quantitative easing) during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. She has published two papers on the topic with Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin and Brian Sack: \\"The financial market effects of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs large-scale asset purchases\\" and \\"Large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve: did they work?\\" Remache published an article for Medium in 2017 along with Antoine Martin, Senior VP and Head of Money and Payments at the Federal Reserve. She has contributed to the Federal Reserve's Liberty Street Economics blog on several occasions on the topic of System Open Market Account (SOMA).
