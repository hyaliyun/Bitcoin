Manfred: A dramatic poem is a closet drama written in 1816‚Äì1817 by Lord Byron. It contains supernatural elements, in keeping with the popularity of the ghost story in England at the time. It is a typical example of a Gothic fiction. Byron commenced this work in late 1816, only a few months after the famous ghost-story sessions with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley that provided the initial impetus for Frankenstein. The supernatural references are made clear throughout the poem. Manfred was adapted musically by Robert Schumann in 1852, in a composition entitled Manfred: Dramatic Poem with Music in Three Parts, and later by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his Manfred Symphony. Friedrich Nietzsche was inspired by the poem's depiction of a super-human being to compose a piano score in 1872 based on it, \\"Manfred Meditation\\". Background Byron wrote this \\"metaphysical drama\\", as he called it, after his marriage to Annabella Millbanke failed because of a scandal due to charges of sexual improprieties and an incestuous affair between Byron and his half- sister, Augusta Leigh. Attacked by the press and ostracised by London society, Byron fled England for Switzerland in 1816 and never returned. At the time, he was living at the Villa Diodati in Switzerland. Because Manfred was written immediately after this, and because it regards a main character tortured by his own sense of guilt for an unmentionable offence, some critics consider it to be autobiographical, or even confessional.\\"Manfred, George Gordon (Noel), Lord Byron ‚Äì Introduction.\\" Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Edna M. Hedblad Russel Whitaker. Vol. 109. Gale Cengage, 2002. eNotes.com. 2006. 25 September 2010 The unnamed but forbidden nature of Manfred's relationship to Astarte is believed to represent Byron's relationship with his half-sister Augusta. Most of Manfred was written on a tour through the Bernese Alps in September 1816. The third act was rewritten in February 1817 since Byron was not happy with its first version. Plot Manfred is a Faustian noble living in the Bernese Alps. Internally tortured by some mysterious guilt, which has to do with the death of his most beloved, Astarte, he uses his mastery of language and spell-casting to summon seven spirits, from whom he seeks forgetfulness. The spirits, who rule the various components of the corporeal world, are unable to control past events and thus cannot grant Manfred's plea. For some time, fate prevents him from escaping his guilt through suicide. At the end, Manfred dies, defying religious temptations of redemption from sin. Throughout the poem he succeeds in challenging all of the authoritative powers he faces, and chooses death over submitting to the powerful spirits. Manfred directs his final words to the Abbot, remarking, \\"Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die\\". \\"The unconquerable individual to the end, Manfred gives his soul to neither heaven nor hell, only to death.\\" Critique Published in June 1817, Manfred has as its epigraph the famous phrase of Shakespeare's Hamlet: \\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\" It shows heavy influence from Goethe's Faust, which Byron most likely read in translation (although he claimed never to have read it). Manfred has as its theme defiant humanism, represented by the hero‚Äôs refusal to bow to supernatural authority. Peter L. Thorslev, Jr. notes that Manfred conceals behind a Gothic exterior the tender heart of the Hero of Sensibility; but as a rebel, like Satan, Cain, and Prometheus, he embodies Romantic self-assertion.Thorslev, Peter L. Jr., The Byronic Hero: Types and Prototypes, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1962) Characters In performance Manfred was not originally intended for stage performance; it was written to be a dramatic poem or, as Byron called it, a \\"metaphysical\\" drama. It has received much more attention on stage for its musical treatments by Tchaikovsky and Schumann than it has on its own dramatic terms. Nevertheless, Manfred was later famously played by Samuel Phelps. There are no recorded full stagings in Britain in the twentieth century, but readings are more popular, partly because of the difficulty of staging a play set in the Alps, partly because of the work's nature as a closet drama that was never actually intended for the stage in the first place. The exceptional size of the role of Manfred also makes the play difficult to cast. There was a production on BBC Radio 3 in 1988, however, which starred Ronald Pickup as Manfred. A new production, adapted and directed by Pauline Harris with original music composed and performed by Olly Fox and starring Joseph Millson as Manfred, was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 8 January 2017 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Manfreds completion.

Manfred in literature The character Manfred was mentioned by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re in his novel The Count of Monte Cristo, where the Count declares: \\"No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open.\\" Indeed, the Count of Monte Cristo is quite similar to Manfred, in that he wants to keep his past a secret, feels superior to social conventions, and is following an agenda that runs counter to the social mores. Fyodor Dostoyevsky mentions the poem in Notes from Underground when the narrator states, \\"I received countless millions and immediately gave them away for the benefit of humanity, at the same moment confessing before the crowd all my infamies, which, of course, were not mere infamies, but also contained within them a wealth of 'the lofty and the beautiful' of something Manfred- like\\" (Dostoyevsky, page 57. Bantam Books 2005) On page 61 of The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon, Di Presso seems to refer (perhaps by accident) to Metzger as Manfred. Manfred's oft-quoted speech from Act II Scene 1 which begins \\"Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?\\" is quoted on page 351 of The Masters of Solitude by Marvin Kaye and Parke Godwin. \\"In Memory of My Feelings\\", the poem by Frank O'Hara, includes the line \\"Manfred climbs to my nape,/ speaks, but I do not hear him,/ I'm too blue.\\" In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke, Byron is said to have written Manfred after meeting the magician Jonathan Strange and finding him most disagreeable. It is suggested that he wrote it because he was so disappointed with Strange that he created a magician more to his liking. The final scene of Daisy Miller by Henry James is set in the Colosseum of Rome. James mentions that, before entering the Colosseum, his protagonist Winterbourne loudly quotes Manfred's monologue on the Colosseum (Act III, Scene IV). Other references to Manfred In the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera Patience Manfred is referenced in Colonel Calverley's patter song \\"If you want a receipt for that popular mystery\\" (A Heavy Dragoon), listing one ingredient as \\"a little of Manfred but not very much of him\\". German gothic metal band The Vision Bleak extensively quote from Manfred in their song \\"A Curse of the Grandest Kind\\", on their 2010 album Set Sail to Mystery Big Finish's Dark Shadows references the tale in an audio production, Dress Me in Dark Dreams. Edith Collins seeks to re-read the poem after some lines are stuck in her head.

Those studying phytochemistry strive to describe the structures of the large number of secondary metabolic compounds found in plants, the functions of these compounds in human and plant biology, and the biosynthesis of these compounds. Plants synthesize phytochemicals for many reasons, including to protect themselves against insect attacks and plant diseases. Phytochemicals in food plants are often active in human biology, and in many cases have health benefits. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes. Phytochemistry can be considered a sub-field of botany or chemistry. Activities can be led in botanical gardens or in the wild with the aid of ethnobotany. The applications of the discipline can be for pharmacognosy, or the discovery of new drugs, or as an aid for plant physiology studies.  Techniques  Techniques commonly used in the field of phytochemistry are extraction, isolation, and structural elucidation (MS,1D and 2D NMR) of natural products, as well as various chromatography techniques (MPLC, HPLC, and LC-MS).  Constituent elements  The list of simple elements of which plants are primarily constructed‚Äîcarbon, oxygen, hydrogen, calcium, phosphorus, etc.‚Äîis not different from similar lists for animals, fungi, or even bacteria. The fundamental atomic components of plants are the same as for all life; only the details of the way in which they are assembled differs.  Eastern medicine  Phytochemistry is widely used in the field of Chinese medicine especially in the field of herbal medicine. Phytochemical technique mainly applies to the quality control of Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine(Indian traditional medicine) or herbal medicine of various chemical components, such as saponins, alkaloids, volatile oils, flavonoids and anthraquinones. In the development of rapid and reproducible analytical techniques, the combination of HPLC with different detectors, such as diode array detector (DAD), refractive index detector (RID), evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and mass spectrometric detector (MSD), has been widely developed. In most cases, biologically active compounds in Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, or herbal medicine have not been determined. Therefore, it is important to use the phytochemical methods to screen and analyze bioactive components, not only for the quality control of crude drugs, but also for the elucidation of their therapeutic mechanisms. Modern pharmacological studies indicate that binding to receptors or ion channels on cell membranes is the first step of some drug actions. A new method in phytochemistry called biochromatography has been developed. This method combines human red cell membrane extraction and high performance liquid chromatography to screen potential active components in Chinese medicine.  Phytochemicals  Many plants produce chemical compounds for defence against herbivores. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in medicinal plants is the scientific basis for their use. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them. Human settlements are often surrounded by weeds useful as medicines, such as nettle, dandelion and chickweed. Many phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds and are not useful in drug discovery. =Alkaloids= Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very widespread in nature, and often toxic. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (Rauvolfia serpentina), quinidine and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and vincristine (Catharanthus roseus). File:Opium poppy.jpgThe opium poppy Papaver somniferum is the source of the alkaloids morphine and codeine. File:Nicotine.svgThe alkaloid nicotine from tobacco binds directly to the body's Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, accounting for its pharmacological effects. File:Koeh-018.jpgDeadly nightshade, Atropa belladonna, yields tropane alkaloids including atropine, scopolamine and hyoscyamine. =Glycosides= Anthraquinone glycosides are found in the laxatives senna, rhubarb and Aloe. The cardiac glycosides are powerful drugs from plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and digitoxin which support the beating of the heart, and act as diuretics. File:Senna alexandrina Mill.-Cassia angustifolia L. (Senna Plant).jpgSenna alexandrina, containing anthraquinone glycosides, has been used as a laxative for millennia. Digitalis purpurea2.jpgThe foxglove, Digitalis purpurea, contains digoxin, a cardiac glycoside. The plant was used to treat heart conditions long before the glycoside was identified. File:Digoxin.svgDigoxin is used to treat atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and sometimes heart failure. =Polyphenols= Polyphenols of several classes are widespread in plants. They include the colourful anthocyanins, hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate is used as a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant materials such as grape seeds are sold for their potential health benefits They have been continually studied in cell cultures for their different anti-cancer effects. Plants containing phytoestrogens have been used for centuries to treat gynaecological disorders such as fertility, menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among these plants are Pueraria mirifica, kudzu, angelica, fennel, and anise. File:Angelica sylvestris 3.jpgAngelica, containing phytoestrogens, has long been used to treat gynaecological disorders. File:Phytoestrogens2.pngPolyphenols include phytoestrogens (top and middle), effective mimics of animal estrogen (bottom). =Terpenes= Terpenes and terpenoids of many kinds are found in resinous plants such as the conifers. They are strongly aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy. Some have had medicinal uses: thymol is an antiseptic and was once used as a vermifuge (anti-worm medicine). File:Thymian.jpgThe essential oil of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris), contains the monoterpene thymol, an antiseptic and antifungal. File:Thymol2.svgThymol is one of many terpenes found in plants.

Named a Cardinal in 1901, he was known for his conservative views and authoritarianism. Biography Puzyna was born in 1842 in what was then a part of the Austrian Empire and former part of the Kingdom of Poland, in the diocese of Lw√≥w. He earned a doctorate in law from the University of Lw√≥w on 24 June 1870. He began a career in civil administration, but decided to embrace an ecclesiastical career. Ordained a priest on 1 December 1878, he was a vicar (assistant pastor) at Przeworsk, and then became a Canon of the Cathedral of Przemy≈õl. He was named auxiliary bishop of the Latin-rite Archbishop of Lw√≥w and titular bishop of Memphis on 26 February 1886. He was consecrated a bishop on 25 March of that same year by Mieczys≈Çaw Halka-Led√≥chowski, with Archbishop Franziskus von Paula Graf von Sch√∂nborn of Prague and Archbishop Joseph Sembratovych of Ukrainian rite Lw√≥w.Archivum Historiae Pontificiae, Volume 17 (Rome 1979), pp. 451‚Äì452. He was translated to the Archdiocese of Krak√≥w on 22 January 1895. On 15 April 1901, Puzyna was created a cardinal-priest, with the title of Santi Vitale, Valeria, Gervasio e Protasio by Pope Leo XIII.Acta sanctae sedis, Volume 33 (Rome 1901), pp. 513‚Äì515. (The date given is 16 April, not 15 April). He received his red hat on 9 June 1902. During the conclave of 1903,The Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1903 (Dr. J.P. Adams). acting on behalf of his Sovereign, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, he presented a veto against the election of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla. Puzyna wanted to avoid the election of Rampolla, who was sympathetic to Russia and Germany. Among other things, Rampolla sought to curry favor with Russia by abolishing the Polish language and instituting Russian in the Russian partition's Catholic churches. These were ethnic and linguistic considerations. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, too, did not wish to see Rampolla elected to the Chair of Peter. He held a grudge against Rampolla for opposing a proper burial for his son Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, upon Rudolf's suicide. Rampolla also openly supported political forces in Austria that were hostile to the Emperor. The Emperor therefore authorized the Cardinal to present the veto in his name. On his way to the conclave, Puzyna met in Vienna with the Emperor and proposed that the Emperor present his veto, jus exclusivae, against Cardinal Rampolla.Princess Catherine Radziwill reports that the idea was the Emperor's, not Cardinal Puzyna's, that the Emperor tried to get the Archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Anton Joseph Gruscha, to carry the Veto, and that the Emperor was refused. Princess Catherine Radziwill, The Austrian Court from Within (New York 1916), 188‚Äì190 The Emperor subscribed to the idea, and Puzyna presented the veto on the third day of the conclave, in the name of His Apostolic Majesty Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary.The Latin text is in A. Battandier (editor), Annuaire pontificale catholique (Paris 1905), p. 135. When the veto was read, Cardinal Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, replied, \\"This communication cannot be received officially or unofficially. No cardinal is to give any consideration to this 'veto' and all are to continue to vote according to their conscience.\\"John-Peter Pham, Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession (Oxford: OUP 2004), chapter 4, citing Carlo Snider, L' episcopato del cardinale Andrea C. Ferrara, Volume II, \\"I tempi di Pio X\\", who prints Cardinal Ferrari's detailed diary of the Conclave. In other words, the attempt at a veto was rejected. It was the last time such a veto was used. The veto, although not recognized by canon law, and as such non-binding, still carried much political weight, as the cardinals feared opposing the manifest will of one of the Christian monarchs. The veto, once conceded by tradition to the Emperor, the King of France and the King of Spain, was abolished by the newly elected Pope Pius X, who imposed the penalty of excommunication upon anyone who would dare to introduce a veto, or otherwise interfere in the election of the Roman Pontiff. Pope Pius X further decreed that all cardinals should take an oath at the beginning of the conclave, promising not to aid any civil power in an attempt to influence the election of the pope.The constitution Commissum nobis (20 January 1904). Text of Commissum nobis (Documenta Catholica Omnia). Puzyna was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1904.

It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces.

These divided the territory into Upper and Lower Britain (Britannia Superior and Inferior), whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum (York). During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of the Allectus's Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was formed and made a part of Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.Notitia Dignitatum.Verona List. The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the Notitia Dignitatum lists the governor of Maxima (originally an equestrian praeses) as having been elevated to consular rank.

Modern scholars are uncertain whether the province was named for the western senior emperor Valerius Maximian or the eastern junior emperor Galerius Maximian. Birley has argued that Maxima and Flavia originally consisted of a single province, which received the name Britannia Caesariensis as a mark of favour for support against the rebel Allectus in 296. Although Flavia is usually thought to have been formed from the old province of Lower Britain, Birley proposes that Upper Britain was divided in two (between Prima and Caesariensis) and then three (Prima, Maxima, and Flavia). This repeats Camden's earlier theory (relying on Sextus Rufus) that Maxima was formed first and Flavia followed sometime after.Stillingfleet, Edward.

Due to its smallness, it is often considered a subunit of the broader Lower Carniola region, although with distinctive cultural, linguistic, and historical features. Due to its proximity with Croatia, White Carniola shares many cultural and linguistic features with the neighboring Kajkavian Croatian areas. It is generally considered the Slovenian region with the closest cultural affinity with other South Slavic territories. It was part of Hungarian Slavonia until the 12th century, after which it shared the historical fate with the Windic March and Lower Carniola to the north. During the 19th century, it was one of the regions with the highest emigration rate in the Slovene Lands, and the Austrian Empire in general. During World War Two, it was an important center of anti-Fascist resistance in Slovenia. Geography Typical landscape in White Carniola The area is confined by the Gorjanci and Koƒçevski Rog mountain ranges in the north and west and the Kolpa River in the south and east, which also forms part of the border between Slovenia and Croatia. As the area could only be reached from northern Lower Carniola by mountain passes, the inhabitants cultivate a certain distinctness. The region corresponds to the present-day municipalities of Metlika, ƒårnomelj and Semiƒç. The terrain is characterised by low karst hills and extensive birch forests. The main river is the Kolpa with its Lahinja, Dobliƒçica and Krupa tributaries. White Carniola is known for Griƒç and Kani≈æarica pottery from clay with a distinct calcite content, as well as for high-quality wines, such as metli≈°ka ƒçrnina (a dark red wine), belokranjec (a white wine), and modra frankinja (i.e. Blaufr√§nkisch).  Tradition  Peasants from White Carniola in traditional costumes at the beginning of the 20th century A distinguishing part of White Carniola is its folk heritage. It still has many folklore events, which show traditional local costumes, music, played on a regionally known instrument called tamburica, and a circle dance, called belokranjsko kolo. A distinctive feature is also the pisanica, a coloured Easter egg decorated in a characteristic manner using beeswax that is found nowhere else in Slovenia. Belokranjska pogaƒça (White Carniola flatbread), a specific type of bread has recently been granted with the European Union's Traditional Speciality Guaranteed designation. Name The name Bela krajina literally means 'White March'. The noun krajina or 'march' refers to a border territory organized for military defense. The adjective bela 'white' may refer to the deciduous trees (especially birch trees) in the area in comparison to \\"black\\" (i.e. coniferous) trees in the neighboring Koƒçevje area. It may also be an old designation for 'west', referring to the western location of the region in comparison to the Croatian Military Frontier (). Non-linguistic explanations connect the designation bela with the traditional white linen clothing of the population.Lah, Iva. 1928. \\"≈Ωupanƒçiƒçeva mladina.\\" In: Albrecht, Fran (ed.)

History =Middle Ages= In the early 12th century, the area was part of the disputed border region between the March of Carniola, established by the Holy Roman Empire in the northwest, and the Kingdom of Hungary in the east and southeast. From about 1127 the local counts of Vi≈°nja Gora (Weichselberg) backed by the Spanheim margraves and the Salzburg archbishops crossed the Gorjanci mountains and marched against the Hungarian and Croatian forces, which they pushed beyond the Kolpa River down to Bregana. The Counts of Weichselberg, who traced their lineage to Saint Hemma of Gurk, established their residence at Metlika (M√∂ttling), and therefore in contemporary sources their lands were also referred to as the County of M√∂ttling (Metlika). After the line became extinct in 1209, the possessions passed to the Carniolan margraves from the House of Andechs, the self-styled Dukes of Merania. In 1229, the area was passed as a dowry of Agnes of Merania to Frederick II of Austria, the last Babenberg ruler, and after his death to Agnes's second husband Ulrich of Spanheim, lord of Carniola and duke of Carinthia. After Ulrich's death in 1269, all of his possessions were inherited by his cousin Ottokar II of Bohemia, who was however defeated by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf of Habsburg and his allies in 1278. Rudolf gave the County of Metlika as a feif to his ally Albert I of Gorizia, together with the eastern portion of the neighboring Windic March. Under his descendant Albert III of Gorizia, these two adjacent areas were united in what became known as the County in the (Windic) March and in Metlika, and became officially a separate estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1368. After Albert's death in 1374, the county was acquired by Archduke Rudolf IV of Austria for the House of Habsburg, who confirmed its privileges, thus maintaining it separate from the Duchy of Carniola. The county was soon leased out to the House of Celje, which acquired full rights of the lords of the land in 1443. It remained part of the Celje domains until their extinction in 1457, whereafter it reverted to the Habsburgs, who gradually incorporated it into Carniola. =Early modern period= With the Ottoman conquest of Serbian territories, groups of Serbs fled to the north or west; of the western migrational groups, some settled in White Carniola and ≈Ωumberak.Vlachs and Uskoks to White Carniola and ≈Ωumberak coming from Croatia and Bosnia.Drago Perko, Rok Cigliƒç, Matija Zorn, The Geography of Slovenia: Small But Diverse, 2019, https://www.bookdepository.com/Geography-Slovenia-Drago-Perko/9783030140656 #page=150Arnold Suppan, Maximilian Graf From the Austrian Empire to Communist East Central Europe, 2010, https://books.google.hr/books/about/From_the_Austrian_Empire_to_Communist_Ea.html?id=RPD_5vMCRroC&redir;_esc=y #page=58,59 The Habsburg commanders brought from Bosnia, later and from parts of Croatia and Dalmatia hundreds or thousands of families and settled them in area which covers White Carniola, across the ≈Ωumberak Mountains all the way to Vinica.Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá; (2004) The Serbs p. 117; Wiley-Blackwell, In September 1597, with the fall of Slatina, some 1,700 Uskoks with their wives and children settled in Carniola, bringing some 4,000 sheep with them. The following year, with the conquest of Cernik, some 500 Uskok families settled in Carniola. At the end of the 17th century, with the stagnation of Ottoman power due to European pressure during internal crisis, and Austrian advance far into Macedonia, Serbs armed themselves and joined the fight against the Ottomans; the Austrian retreat prompted another massive exodus of Serbs from the Ottoman territories 1690 (see Great Serb Migrations). In his 1689 work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, the historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor described the language, clothing, and customs of the people of White Carniola region as Croatian. The self-identification of students on the university registers in Graz and Vienna between 1643 and 1712 shows that as many as 88% of students from White Carniola identified as Croats, and only 12% as Carniolans. The provincial designation 'Croats' (Crovathen/Crobathen) was used for White Carniola in 1709, and the name 'Croats' for the inhabitants of White Carniola is found in 1725 in a report by a doctor named Zalokar from Novo Mesto. The dialect of the parish of Vinica in far southern White Carniola was marked as Croatian in 1795. Buildings =Castles= Ruins of Pobre≈æje Castle Several castles were built in the border region, especially during the Ottoman Wars from the 15th century onwards, as in ƒårnomelj, Gradac and Vinica. The remains of the large fortress in Pobre≈æje were destroyed in World War II. Culture Based on surnames found in White Carniola, it may be concluded that their ancestors were Serbs and Croats. In old folk poetry of White Carniola, Serbian hero Prince Marko is often mentioned, sung in \\"clean Shtokavian\\". A small Serb community exists in White Carniola.  Notable people  Notable people that were born or lived in White Carniola include: *Juro Adle≈°iƒç (1884‚Äì1968), lawyer and politician, mayor of Ljubljana from 1935 to 1942 *Draga Ahaƒçiƒç (born 1924), actress, film director, translator, and journalist *Andrej Bajuk (1943‚Äì2011), politician and economist *Joe Cerne (born 1942), American football player *Oton Gliha (1914‚Äì1999), Croatian painter *Miran Jarc (1900‚Äì1942), writer, poet, playwright, and essayist *Lojze Krakar (1926‚Äì1995), poet, translator, editor, literary historian, and essayist *Radko Poliƒç (born 1942), actor *John Vertin (1844‚Äì1899), Catholic priest, Bishop of Marquette in the US state of Michigan from 1879 to 1899 *Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç (1878‚Äì1949), poet, playwright, and translator  References   External links  * Category:Subdivisions of Carniola Category:Historical regions in Slovenia ","title":"White Carniola"},{"id":"1246649","text":"Stephen McDannell Hillenburg (August 21, 1961 ‚Äì November 26, 2018) was an American animator and marine science educator. He is best remembered for creating the Nickelodeon animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Hillenburg served as the showrunner for the first three seasons of the show, which has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series. Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an informative picture book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (19931996) after his success with The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), short films that he made while studying animation. In 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants. The show has aired continuously since its premiere in 1999. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, but Nickelodeon continued to produce more episodes after he departed the series. He went back to making short films, with Hollywood Blvd., USA in 2013, but continued to be credited as an executive producer for SpongeBob SquarePants. Hillenburg co-wrote the story for the second film adaptation of the series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, which was released in 2015. Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg also received other recognition, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Hillenburg was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue to work on SpongeBob SquarePants as long as possible. He died on November 26, 2018 at the age of 57. Early life and education Stephen McDannell Hillenburg was born on August21, 1961 at Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly N. Hillenburg Jr., worked for the U.S. military. His mother, Nancy (n√©e Dufour), taught visually impaired students. When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California, where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, eventually became a draftsman/designer as well. Hillenburg had no recollection of life in Oklahoma, only of growing up in Anaheim, California. When an interviewer asked him to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was \\"probably well- meaning and naive like all kids.\\" His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. Hillenburg said that Cousteau \\"provided a view into that world\\", which he had not known existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that \\"should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad.\\" Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting \\"a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting\\", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it. \\"Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that'\\", Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew he \\"had some [creative] skill\\". He asserted that his artistry came from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was \\"really, really gifted\\" and a \\"great painter\\". In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tourn√©e of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was \\"knocked out\\" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). \\"That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,\\" he recounted. He attended Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing himself as a \\"band geek\\" who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg took part in a \\"dive program\\" at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: \\"The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist.\\" Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: \\"You should just draw fish.\\" However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by \\"making weird, little paintings\\". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California as a marine-science major. He minored in art, and claimed that \\"[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.\\" In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but said it would be in art: \\"Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.\\" Early career Hillenburg taught marine biology to visitors of the Orange County Marine Institute (pictured) in Dana Point, California during the mid-1980s. After graduating from college, Hillenburg held various jobs in 1984, including as a park service attendant in Utah and an art director in San Francisco, before landing the job he wanted: teaching children. He hoped to work in a national park on the coast, and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now known as the Ocean Institute), an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. Hillenburg was a marine-biology teacher there for three years: \\"We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures.\\" He stayed at the Dana Point Marina and was also a staff artist. Although \\"[i]t was a great experience\\" for him, during this period, Hillenburg realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession. While working there, one of the educational directors asked him if he would be interested in creating an educational comic book about the animal life of tidal pools. He created a comic called The Intertidal Zone, which he used to teach his students. It featured anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters‚Äîincluding \\"Bob the Sponge\\", the comic's co-host, who resembled an actual sea sponge, as opposed to his later SpongeBob SquarePants character, who resembles a kitchen sponge. He tried to get the comic published, but the publishers he approached turned him down. During this time, Hillenburg also started going to animation festivals such as the International Tourn√©e of Animation and Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation where films made by students from the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts) were shown. He determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field. Hillenburg had planned to take a master's degree in art, but instead of \\"going back to school for painting\\", he left his job in 1987 to become an animator. Hillenburg enrolled in CalArts' Experimental Animation Program in 1989. About this decision, he said: \\"Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle.\\" He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considered his \\"Art Dad\\" and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg said, \\"[Engel] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [prior experience in] animation really.\\" Hillenburg graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation. Animation career =Early works= Shots from The Green Beret (top) and Wormholes Hillenburg made his first animated works, short films The Green Beret (1991) and Wormholes (1992), while at CalArts. The Green Beret was about a physically challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies. Wormholes was his seven-minute thesis film, about the theory of relativity. He described the latter as \\"a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena\\" in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation, which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film. The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship. \\"It meant a lot. They funded one of the projects I'm most proud of, even with SpongeBob. It provided me the opportunity just to make a film that was personal, and what I would call independent, and free of some of the commercial needs,\\" he said in 2003. Wormholes was shown at several international animation festivals, including: the Annecy International Animated Film Festival; the Hiroshima International Animation Festival; the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration; the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen; and the Ottawa International Animation Festival, where it won Best Concept. LA Weekly labeled the film \\"road-trippy\\" and \\"Zap-comical\\", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times opined that it was inventive. Hillenburg explained that \\"anything goes\\" in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ \\"an industry style\\"; he preferred to traditionally animate his films (where each frame is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons \\"out of sand by filming piles of sand changing\\". Hillenburg had at least one other short film that he made as an animation student but its title is unspecified. =Rocko's Modern Life= Hillenburg's first professional job in the animation business was as a director on Rocko's Modern Life (19931996), Nickelodeon's first in- house cartoon production. He \\"ended up finding work in the industry and got a job\\" at the television network after he met the show's creator, Joe Murray, at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival, where Wormholes and Murray's My Dog Zero were both in competition. Murray, who was looking for people to direct Rocko's Modern Life at the time, saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series. He \\"[had] friends that [gave him] a hard time about [the offer]. ... but doors opened when [he] stepped into the animation world,\\" so he accepted it. He \\"was planning on being a starving artist\\": \\"[I spent] several thousand dollars to make a film and [realized] I may not make it backI had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film... and he took a huge chance,\\" Hillenburg related. Hillenburg worked closely with Murray on Rocko's Modern Life for its whole run on the air. Aside from directing, he also produced, wrote and storyboarded for some episodes, and served as the executive story editor. In 1995, during the show's fourth and final season, he was promoted to creative director, where he helped oversee pre- and post-production. Working on the series enabled him to repay his loans. He later related that he \\"learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV\\" from his stint on Rocko's Modern Life. =SpongeBob SquarePants= Creation Some evidence shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute. He indicated that children's television series such as The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (19871988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (19861991) \\"sparked something in [him].\\" He continued, \\"I don't know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [SpongeBob SquarePants] together.\\" During the production of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, he had not even considered creating his own series: \\"After watching Joe [Murray] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I would never want to produce a show of my own.\\" However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: \\"For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [my two interests] all came together in [a show]. I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding,\\" Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day. As he was developing the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: \\"I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays.\\" It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, \\"something that was fantastic but believable.\\" He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: \\"I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one.\\" In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge. Bob the Sponge is the comic's \\"announcer\\". He resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued this design because it \\"was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher.\\" In determining the new character's personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, Pee-wee Herman, Abbott and Costello, and The Three Stooges. He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge, and realized that this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly: \\"[I]t looked so funny. I think as far as cartoon language goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking fora somewhat nerdy, squeaky clean oddball.\\" To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had begun with his on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character. While pitching the cartoon to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an \\"underwater terrarium with models of the characters\\", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman described the setup as \\"pretty amazing\\". Although Derek Drymon, creative director of SpongeBob SquarePants, described the pitch as stressful, he said it went \\"very well\\". Nickelodeon approved and gave Hillenburg money to produce the show. Broadcast SpongeBob SquarePants was Nickelodeon's first original Saturday-morning cartoon. It first aired as a preview on May 1, 1999, and officially premiered on July 17 of the same year. Hillenburg noted that the show's premise \\"is that innocence prevailswhich I don't think it always does in real life.\\" It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups. James Poniewozik of Time magazine described the titular character as \\"the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him.\\" On the other hand, The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said that the show \\"is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. ...Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet.\\" SpongeBob SquarePants was an immediate hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pok√©mon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change increased the number of older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: \\"I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience.\\" SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on to become one of the longest-running series on Nickelodeon. \\"Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it,\\" Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue. Departure In 2002, Hillenburg halted production of the show after the third season was completed to focus on the making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie which was released in 2004: \\"I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [Nickelodeon] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie,\\" he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the production of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel died at the age of 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel \\"truly was the most influential artistic person in [his] life.\\" The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, \\"Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents.\\" After completing the film, Hillenburg wanted to end the series \\"so [it] wouldn't jump the shark.\\" \\"We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [The Ren & Stimpy Show] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now was a good time to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore,\\" Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: \\"The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to,\\" storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: \\"I think [Nickelodeon executives] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality.\\" Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer had a direct involvement producing SpongeBob SquarePants, he retained his position as an executive producer and maintained an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, he voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director. In 2014, Tibbitt announced on his Twitter account that Hillenburg would return to the show. However, he did not specify what position the former showrunner would hold. As early as 2012, Hillenburg had already been contributing to another film based on the series, which was first reported in 2011 and officially announced the following year, with Tibbitt as director. Tibbitt also wrote the story with Hillenburg, who \\"[had] been in the studio everyday working with [the crew].\\" Besides writing, Hillenburg also executive-produced. He said in 2014: \\"Actually when [the film] wraps, I want to get back to the show. ...it is getting harder and harder to come up with stories. So Paul [Tibbitt] and I are really going to brainstorm and come up with fresh material.\\" Called The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, the second film adaptation was released in 2015 to positive critical reception, currently holding a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 80 percent and an average rating of 6.5/10. It earned $323.4 million worldwide, becoming the second highest- grossing film based on an animated television show, behind The Simpsons Movie (2007). Controversy Despite its widespread popularity, SpongeBob SquarePants has been involved in public controversies. In 2005, a promotional video showing SpongeBob and other characters from children's shows singing together to promote diversity and tolerance was attacked by an evangelical group because they saw SpongeBob as being used to \\"advocate homosexuality\\". James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the video of promoting homosexuality, because it was sponsored by a pro-tolerance group. The incident prompted questions as to whether SpongeBob is gay. Although the character has enjoyed popularity with gay viewers, Hillenburg had already denied this in 2002, clarifying at the time that he considers the character \\"somewhat asexual\\". After Dobson's comments, Hillenburg reasserted his position, stating that sexual preference does not play a part in what they are \\"trying to do\\" with the series. Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context, and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video, but rather with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. =Other pursuits= A still from Hollywood Blvd., USA In 1998, Hillenburg formed United Plankton Pictures Inc., a television and film production company, which produces SpongeBob SquarePants and related media. From 2011 to 2018, the company published SpongeBob Comics, a comic-book series based on the cartoon. Hillenburg announced the venture in a 2011 press release, where he said, \\"I'm hoping that fans will enjoy finally having a SpongeBob comic book from me.\\" Various cartoonists, including James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabot, have contributed to issues of the comic. According to Jeff Lenburg, in his book Who's Who in Animated Cartoons, Hillenburg was co-writing and co-directing a second animated feature film based on Rob Zombie's comic-book series, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, which was slated for a 2006 release. He helped to write Diggs Tailwagger, a 2007 pilot by Derek Drymon. Hillenburg stated in 2009 that he was developing two other television projects that he did not want to discuss. In 2010, he began working on Hollywood Blvd., USA, a new short film for animation festivals. In making the two-minute film, he videotaped people walking and animated them in walk cycles. Hillenburg said in 2012, \\"I hope to get [the film] done. It takes forever.\\" He was aiming to finish it that fall. In 2013, three years after production began, Hollywood Blvd., USA was released to festivals. Hillenburg characterized it as a \\"personal film\\" and said that \\"it's not a narrative. It's just really about people in our town.\\" Personal life Hillenburg married Karen Umland, a Southern Californian chef who teaches at the New School of Cooking in Culver City, in 1998. Hillenburg deemed her to be the funniest person that he knew, and the character of Karen Plankton was named after her. Also in 1998, the couple's first and only child, son Clay, was born. Hillenburg formerly resided in Hollywood and in Pasadena, and lived with his family in San Marino, California until his death. His hobbies included surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming, and performing \\"noisy rock music\\" on his guitar. He jammed with his son, who is a drummer, which Hillenburg called \\"a great way to bond with each other.\\" He also enjoyed birdwatching at home, but said that he was always \\"an ocean freak\\". He was known informally as \\"Steve\\" among his family, friends, and fans. According to his colleagues, Hillenburg was \\"a perfectionist workaholic\\". He was also known for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg was \\"very shy\\". She went on to say, \\"He doesn't want people to know about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down- to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our corporate integrity.\\" Hillenburg said about himself, \\"I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy.\\" =Philanthropy= Hillenburg, with his wife Karen, had endowed numerous projects and organizations through the United Plankton Charitable Trust, which the couple established in 2005. The foundation, the name of which was adopted from Hillenburg's United Plankton Pictures, supports areas of the two's personal interest, giving under $500,000 annually . Grantees include large, established arts-related organizations such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound, in which Karen is co-chair. Health accounts for most of their grantmaking; they had gifted to Planned Parenthood (where Karen is member of the board of directors ) and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, among other national health organizations. In education, they had invested to schools, including the Polytechnic School in Pasadena (which their son attended), CalArts, and the Humboldt State University. Donations to the latter helped fund the HSU Marine Lab and the Stephen Hillenburg Marine Science Research Award Endowment, which the couple created in 2018 to support the university's marine-science research students. The previous year, the Princess Grace Foundation introduced the Stephen Hillenburg Animation Scholarship, an annual grant from the Hillenburgs to emerging animators. =Illness, death, and legacy= Hillenburg disclosed to Variety magazine in March 2017 that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. He released a statement to the publication, in which he said that he would continue to work on SpongeBob SquarePants \\"for as long as [he is] able.\\" He added: \\"My family and I are grateful for the outpouring of love and support. We ask that our sincere request for privacy be honored during this time.\\" Hillenburg was in the early stages of the disease at the time, according to a source close to him. He died from the muscle disease on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57. According to his death certificate, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean at least off the coast of California the next day. During the halftime show for Super Bowl LIII, the performing band Maroon 5 arranged to use a clip from the SpongeBob episode \\"Band Geeks\\" (which uses the song \\"Sweet Victory\\" as part of a spoof of a football halftime show) during their show as a means to pay tribute to Hillenburg. A full clip of the \\"Sweet Victory\\" song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but not during the game, which angered many fans. Subsequently, the Dallas Stars, during one of their games, played \\"Sweet Victory\\", garnering a more positive response. The TV special SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout and the theatrical film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run are dedicated to him. Awards and honors In 1992, one of Hillenburg's early works, Wormholes, won for Best Concept at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. For SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards, winning in the categories of Outstanding Special Class Animated Program and Outstanding Sound Editing ‚Äì Animation in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The show has also received several other awards and nominations, including 17 Annie Award nominations, winning six times, as well as winning two British Academy Children's Awards, out of four nominations. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants won its first TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming nomination. In 2001, Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit organization, honored Hillenburg with its Walk the Talk award. He was recognized for raising public awareness of marine life through SpongeBob SquarePants. The following year, Hillenburg was given the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society, and the Princess Grace Statue Award from the Princess Grace Foundation. In 2018, Hillenburg received the Winsor McCay Award at the 45th Annie Awards, and a special recognition at the 45th Daytime Emmy Awards \\"for his contribution and impact made in the animation field and within the broadcast industry.\\" Filmography =Film= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Role ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  - ! scope=row ' (short film)  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1992  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row Wormholes (short film)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row ''''  2004  Parrot (voice)   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row Hollywood Blvd., USA (short film)  2013  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row ''''  2015  Baby in Stroller (voice)   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row ''''  2020  ‚Äî   } =Television= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Role ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  - ! scope=row Rocko's Modern Life  19931996  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row SpongeBob SquarePants  19992018    style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - ! scope=row Square Roots: The Story of SpongeBob SquarePants  2009  Himself  Documentary  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  } References Further reading  * External links  * Stephen Hillenburg at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio website Category:1961 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American scientists Category:20th- century American educators Category:20th-century American biologists Category:21st-century American male actors Category:21st-century American male writers Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:21st-century American scientists Category:American art directors Category:American cartoonists Category:American comics artists Category:American chefs Category:American experimental filmmakers Category:American male painters Category:American male screenwriters Category:American male voice actors Category:American marine biologists Category:American storyboard artists Category:American surrealist artists Category:American television directors Category:American television writers Category:American patrons of the arts Category:American animated film directors Category:American animated film producers Category:Animators from California Category:Animators from Oklahoma Category:Annie Award winners Category:Burials at sea Category:California Institute of the Arts alumni Category:Creative directors Category:Deaths from motor neuron disease Category:Educators from California Category:Educators from Oklahoma Category:Film directors from California Category:Film directors from Oklahoma Category:Film producers from California Category:Film producers from Oklahoma Category:Humboldt State University alumni Category:Male actors from California Category:Male actors from Oklahoma Category:American male chefs Category:American male television writers Category:Nickelodeon people Category:Painters from California Category:Painters from Oklahoma Category:Patrons of schools Category:People from Anaheim, California Category:People from Fort Sill, Oklahoma Category:People from Hollywood, Los Angeles Category:People from Lawton, Oklahoma Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:People from San Marino, California Category:Philanthropists from California Category:Philanthropists from Oklahoma Category:Princess Grace Awards winners Category:Scientists from California Category:Scientists from Oklahoma Category:Screenwriters from California Category:Screenwriters from Oklahoma Category:Showrunners Category:Television producers from California Category:Television show creators Category:Voice directors ","title":"Stephen Hillenburg"},{"id":"1246654","text":"House of Puzyna is a Rurikid princely house, now already for several centuries living in Poland. Originally they were from Belarus and the region of Smolensk. Their most prominent members lived in the early 20th century. Coat of arms of the princely Puzyna family * material: Russian Wikipedia During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they were counted as Litvin princes, the highest nobility of Lithuania. Of Ruthenian origin. Mostly because the archival documentation of the 14th century is weak, thanks to Mongol depredations, their precise lineage from Rurik is under shroud. Their tradition, as well as that of the family of Oginskis, refer to them being descended from rulers of the principality of Kozelsk. Several versions of their precise Rurikid origins have been presented. The Rurikid dynasty's branch of Kozelsk flourished in the 14th century. As one of the Oka principalities in the region of Upper Oka, near Smolensk. These princes were said to be descended from Saint Michael of Chernihiv who was martyred in 1246. (It is generally in published family trees that their one forefather was St.Michael's descendant prince Tit - but nothing more is actually known of this Tit than merely his name, without even explicit attestation of his patronymic, and names of one or more of his historically attested sons, and that in those generations his family -branch- held Kozelsk and Karachev. We can be relatively certain of this Tit's existence because at least one son of his in mid-14th century carried the patronymic 'Titovich' in his near- contemporary documentation.) Better historical sources know the early forefathers of the Puzyna and Oginskis, princes bynamed Hlazyna and Gluszonek who were magnates in the region of Smolensk in the late 15th century. These princes Hlazyna would thus have been descendants of some branch of Dukes of Kozelsk. In 1408 the Duke of Kozelsk held Rzhev, had the town built. He was possibly merely a kinsman of the Oginski and Puzyna ancestors, and not their direct forefather, as the Kozelsk family seems to have developed several branches already prior to that date. * there are historically weak beliefs that the Puzyna were branched from the Oginskis by the somewhat unhistorical brothers Grigor 'the fire' (for his hot temper) and Valadimir 'the bubble' (for being obese), allegedly respectively forefathers of the Oginski and the Puzyna, who would have been sons of a prince Tit or a prince Juri or a prince Tit-Juri, of Kozelsk, one allegedly in the 15th generation from Rurik. However, sources contemporary to those centuries do not mention such things (source: Rodoslovtsah). These still have found their way to a lot of genealogies (compare for example the publications of Peter V Dolgorukov). Quite possibly, this another, later Tit is just a genealogically invented ghost of the real Tit whose existence is known from his son's patronymic. In 1486, boyar Dmitrijus Ivanovicius Hlushonokas received the manor and fief of Oginty in Zhizhmorski, Lithuania proper. His descendants became known as Oginskis, the Lithuanian branch of the Hlazyna. Prince Teodoras Bogdanaitis appears as the first of this lineage with the byname Oginski. In the early 16th century, Dmitrijus' younger brother, the Belarusian prince Ivan Ivanovich Hluszonak was contemporary of king Sigismund I of Poland as well as his official, and his son prince Timofej Ivanovich was known with byname 'puzyna'. It was this branch which developed to the lineage of Puzyna. Vasilij Ivanovich received from king in 1516 the estate of Nosov in Melnitski (–ê—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤, –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—â–∏—Ö—Å—è –∫ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –†—É—Å–∏, t. 3, ‚Ññ4, p. 4-5). It seems that these persons are present in later generations of Puzyna in the works of Dolgorukov, as well as in the findings of the Polish Jesuit Andrzej Pezharski, in his book 'Annibal ad Portas'. The name of Puzyna appears to have been found in chronicles in the 16th century. So, the two bynames (Oginskis and Puzyna) actually formed only in later generations of the two brothers, and not yet to the two brothers themselves. But it has been easy although mistaken to try to make already two brothers to carry the nicknames. Since bynames of the real historically attested brothers Dimitrijus and Ivan were actually not such, this has presumably led to confusions about what were the first names of the two brothers who started the branches, some thus picking up the unhistorical names Grigor and Valadimir, as well as the 'mythical' forefather name Tit (who was real person in the ancestry but farther back) as their father. These two brothers (Dimitrijus, Ivan) were sons of prince Ivan Vasilievich, son of one Vasili Hlazyna, a Ruthenian princely magnate in region of Smolensk. All in all, prince Ivan Vasilievich had five sons: Dmitri, Ivan, Leo, Michael and Andrew, according to Ptashitski. Vasili Hlazyna's other son (according to S L Ptashitski) was prince Olehno Vasilievich, who fled to Moscow and thus left Belarusia-Lithuania. The princes of Puzyna have as their earliest historically attested patrilineal forefather the said Vasili Hlazyna in the mid-15th century - just as the record-harmed Mongol-domination epoch was over. In light of strict research, there is not an attested lineage back to Rurikids. They just appear from post-Mongol mists of history. However, the princely title which was accorded to the family, speaks for a Rurikid patriline. The Rurikid DNA project by Y DNA evidence has proven that the Puzyna belong to the patriline of the Rurikids. The tradition being Rurikid is correct.

The historical function of the council circles is debated. Some suggest that the talking circles are ceremonial, and others support a hypothesis that they were places for political discussion that suggest aboriginal democracy. In current use, the council circle is often synonymous with the talking circle, and is a means of group communication that promotes input from all the members. The practice has been adopted by people of many cultures. A talking stick, or other significant or impromptu object, is passed around the circle, and only the circle member holding the stick is allowed to speak, though he or she may allow others to interject. Talking sticks in the context of the council circle may have been used pre-historically by indigenous peoples to create egalitarian forums. Photographs show that some talking sticks were very tall, suggesting that circle participants would have stood when speaking.For example, see the photograph by Edward Curtis on page 103 of: See also * Center for Council * Learning circle * Study circle References External links *Talking Circle ‚Äì A Place for Peace, Harmony and Reflection by Daniel N.

An everyday life example of this is what happens when someone takes a photo using a flash - another picture cannot be taken immediately afterward because the flash needs a few seconds to recharge. In addition to lowering the detection efficiency, dead times can have other effects, such as creating possible exploits in quantum cryptography. Overview The total dead time of a detection system is usually due to the contributions of the intrinsic dead time of the detector (for example the ion drift time in a gaseous ionization detector), of the analog front end (for example the shaping time of a spectroscopy amplifier) and of the data acquisition (the conversion time of the analog-to-digital converters and the readout and storage times). The intrinsic dead time of a detector is often due to its physical characteristics; for example a spark chamber is \\"dead\\" until the potential between the plates recovers above a high enough value. In other cases the detector, after a first event, is still \\"live\\" and does produce a signal for the successive event, but the signal is such that the detector readout is unable to discriminate and separate them, resulting in an event loss or in a so-called \\"pile-up\\" event where, for example, a (possibly partial) sum of the deposited energies from the two events is recorded instead. In some cases this can be minimised by an appropriate design, but often only at the expense of other properties like energy resolution. The analog electronics can also introduce dead time; in particular a shaping spectroscopy amplifier needs to integrate a fast rise, slow fall signal over the longest possible time (usually from .5 up to 10 microseconds) to attain the best possible resolution, such that the user needs to choose a compromise between event rate and resolution. Trigger logic is another possible source of dead time; beyond the proper time of the signal processing, spurious triggers caused by noise need to be taken into account. Finally, digitisation, readout and storage of the event, especially in detection systems with large number of channels like those used in modern High Energy Physics experiments, also contribute to the total dead time. To alleviate the issue, medium and large experiments use sophisticated pipelining and multi-level trigger logic to reduce the readout rates. From the total time a detection system is running, the dead time must be subtracted to obtain the live time. Paralyzable and non-paralyzable behaviour A detector, or detection system, can be characterized by a paralyzable or non-paralyzable behaviour. In a non-paralyzable detector, an event happening during the dead time is simply lost, so that with an increasing event rate the detector will reach a saturation rate equal to the inverse of the dead time. In a paralyzable detector, an event happening during the dead time will not just be missed, but will restart the dead time, so that with increasing rate the detector will reach a saturation point where it will be incapable of recording any event at all. A semi-paralyzable detector exhibits an intermediate behaviour, in which the event arriving during dead time does extend it, but not by the full amount, resulting in a detection rate that decreases when the event rate approaches saturation.  Analysis  It will be assumed that the events are occurring randomly with an average frequency of f. That is, they constitute a Poisson process. The probability that an event will occur in an infinitesimal time interval dt is then f dt. It follows that the probability P(t) that an event will occur at time t to t+dt with no events occurring between t=0 and time t is given by the exponential distribution (Lucke 1974, Meeks 2008): :P(t)dt=fe^{-ft}dt\\\\, The expected time between events is then :\\\\langle t \\\\rangle = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty tP(t)dt = 1/f = Non-paralyzable analysis = For the non-paralyzable case, with a dead time of \\\\tau, the probability of measuring an event between t=0 and t=\\\\tau is zero. Otherwise the probabilities of measurement are the same as the event probabilities. The probability of measuring an event at time t with no intervening measurements is then given by an exponential distribution shifted by \\\\tau: :P_m(t)dt=0\\\\, for t\\\\le\\\\tau\\\\, :P_m(t)dt=\\\\frac{fe^{-ft}dt}{\\\\int_\\\\tau^\\\\infty fe^{-ft}dt} = fe^{-f(t-\\\\tau)}dt for t>\\\\tau\\\\, The expected time between measurements is then :\\\\langle t_m \\\\rangle = \\\\int_\\\\tau^\\\\infty tP_m(t)dt = \\\\langle t \\\\rangle+\\\\tau In other words, if N_m counts are recorded during a particular time interval T and the dead time is known, the actual number of events (N) may be estimated by :N \\\\approx \\\\frac{N_m}{1- \\\\tau / T} If the dead time is not known, a statistical analysis can yield the correct count. For example, (Meeks 2008), if t_i are a set of intervals between measurements, then the t_i will have a shifted exponential distribution, but if a fixed value D is subtracted from each interval, with negative values discarded, the distribution will be exponential as long as D is greater than the dead time \\\\tau. For an exponential distribution, the following relationship holds: :\\\\frac{\\\\langle t^n \\\\rangle}{\\\\langle t \\\\rangle^n} = n! where n is any integer. If the above function is estimated for many measured intervals with various values of D subtracted (and for various values of n) it should be found that for values of D above a certain threshold, the above equation will be nearly true, and the count rate derived from these modified intervals will be equal to the true count rate. Time-To-Count With a modern microprocessor based ratemeter one technique for measuring field strength with detectors (e.g., Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller tubes) with a recovery time is Time-To-Count. In this technique, the detector is armed at the same time a counter is started. When a strike occurs, the counter is stopped. If this happens many times in a certain time period (e.g., two seconds), then the mean time between strikes can be determined, and thus the count rate. Live time, dead time, and total time are thus measured, not estimated. This technique is used quite widely in radiation monitoring systems used in nuclear power generating stations.

It and the American alligator are the only living species in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. Dark gray or black in color with a fully armored body, the Chinese alligator grows to in length and weighs as an adult. It brumates in burrows in winter and is nocturnal in summer. Mating occurs in early summer, with females most commonly producing 20‚Äì30 eggs, which are smaller than those of any other crocodilian. The species is an opportunistic feeder, primarily eating fish and invertebrates. A vocal species, adults bellow during the mating season and young vocalize to communicate with their parents and other juveniles. Captive specimens have reached age 70, and wild specimens can live to over 50. Living in bodies of fresh water, the Chinese alligator's range is restricted to six regions in the province of Anhui, as well as possibly the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Originally living as far away from its current range as Japan, the species previously had a wide range and population, but beginning in 5000 BC, multiple threats, such as habitat destruction, caused the species' population and range to decline. The population in the wild was about 1000 in the 1970s, decreased to below 130 in 2001, and grew after 2003, with its population being about 300 as of 2017. Listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, multiple conservation actions have been taking place for this species. The Chinese alligator has been a part of Chinese literature since the third century. In the late 1200s, Marco Polo became the first person outside of China to write about it. In some writings, the Chinese alligator has been associated with the Chinese dragon. Many pieces of evidence suggest that the Chinese alligator was an inspiration for the Chinese dragon.  History and taxonomy  Chinese alligators have appeared in Chinese literature since 222‚Äì227 AD. Marco Polo was the first person outside of China to write about the alligator, when he came to China and saw it in the late 1200s. He said that the alligator lived in \\"caverns\\" in the day and hunted at night, and that humans targeted its meat and skin, with its gall bladder having multiple medical purposes. He stated that it was found in lakes, rivers, and springs in the province \\"Karazan\\". In 1656, Martino Martini, a priest, wrote that the Chinese alligator lived in the river Yangtze and was \\"much feared by the local residents\\". Unlike Polo, Martini wrote his description using information from Chinese literature. Chinese alligators were later thought to give Buddhist priests merit if the priests were to buy alligators held in captivity and release them. In 1869, Robert Swinhoe saw a Chinese alligator in an exhibit in Shanghai and wrote the following year: The alligator was described by French naturalist Albert-Auguste Fauvel in 1879 as Alligator sinensis. The genus Alligator had previously contained only the American alligator since its creation in 1807. Fauvel wrote a detailed description of the species in a book titled Alligators in China: Their History, Description & Identification, including information about its historical account. In 1947, it was suggested to group the Chinese alligator in a separate genus from its American relative, due to the Chinese alligator's bony plate on its upper eyelid. This bony plate is present in caimans, but is rarely present in the American alligator. At the time, the plate was thought to not appear in the American alligator at all. This produced the belief that the Chinese alligator's relationship with other crocodilians was between caimans and American alligators. Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described the genus Caigator the same year, which only contained the Chinese alligator, making its scientific name Caigator sinensis. However, paleontology has shown that the Chinese alligator has evolved from other now- extinct members of the genus Alligator. This and the fact that the American alligator does infrequently have a bony plate on its eyelid have caused Caigator sinensis to now be classified as a synonym of Alligator sinensis. There is still not a consensus among biologists that the American and Chinese alligators belong to the same genus, despite multiple studies comparing the biochemistry, histology, and various other aspects of the two crocodilians. The genus, Alligator, is based on the Spanish word el lagarto, which translates to \\"the lizard\\". The specific name, sinensis, is from the Latin plural possessive sinaensis, meaning \\"belonging to China\\".  Description  Comparison of the American alligator (top) and the Chinese alligator (bottom) Detail of head One of the smallest species of crocodilians, the Chinese alligator attains a length of and weight of as an adult. Females are roughly three-quarters the length of males. It is less than half the size of the American alligator, which typically grows to a length of for males and for females. Reports are known of alligators in China reaching in past centuries, but these are no longer thought to be accurate. The Chinese alligator is almost completely black or dark gray in color as an adult. It has a short and broad snout, which points slightly upwards and narrows at the end. Its head is robust, more so than that of the American alligator, with a bony septum dividing its nostrils. It has 72‚Äì76 teeth, of which 13‚Äì14 are maxillary, five premaxillary, and 18‚Äì19 mandibular. Unlike the American alligator, the Chinese alligator is fully armored, including its belly. It contains up to 17 rows of scales across its body, which are soft on its belly and side and rougher on its back. Its upper eyelids have bony plates on them, a feature usually not present in the American alligator. Its tail is wider than that of the American alligator. It does not have webbed feet, in contrast to the American alligator, which has extensive webbing on its toes.  Ecology  The Chinese alligator brumates in burrows during winter. After this period of dormancy, it frequently spends time in the sun before summer begins. It is nocturnal throughout summer, feeding at night and sheltering in the daytime, to avoid both humans and the summer heat. This behavior gives it the ability to live in areas where humans are common. A docile species, it generally does not intentionally hurt humans. = Burrowing = This alligator brumates from late October to mid-April, emerging in early May. It constructs its burrows next to ponds and other small bodies of water, using its head and front legs to dig into the ground. They can be large and complex, containing multiple rooms, water pools, and entrances. Most of them are long, with each room having enough space for alligators to turn around after entering. Outside of winter, the burrows serve as retreat sites for the alligators and in summer are where they take shelter in the daytime. The temperature inside them is never colder than . The burrows can be problematic for farmers, as they cause destruction of farm dykes. = Life cycle = The breeding season of the Chinese alligator is early summer, with the rate of mating being highest in mid-June. The alligator breeds earlier in the year if temperatures are higher. During the time of mating, males commonly search around ponds to find a mate and both male and female specimens are often aggressive to each other. The species exhibits polygamy, with single males mating with multiple females and/or a single female mating with several males. A study of 50 clutches showed multiple paternity in 60% of them, with up to three males contributing. Nests are typically built about 2‚Äì3 weeks after mating, from July to late August. Constructed by the females, they are composed of rotting plants, such as leaves, and are high. Females prefer to assemble them in areas that have a thick canopy and are far from human disturbance. Because islands frequently satisfy both of these conditions, they are often used as nesting sites. Nests are always near water sources. Individuals often return to the same nesting site yearly, although intraspecific competition and environmental changes can force them to change nesting sites. Generally laid at night, mating typically produces 20‚Äì30 eggs, although according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), clutch size ranges between 10 and 40 eggs. After the eggs are laid, the females sometimes leave the nest, but other times stay to protect the eggs. The eggs are about in length, in diameter, and in weight, making them smaller than the eggs of any other crocodilian. They are typically incubated for about 70 days. On average, the temperature of incubation is , including the day and night. This temperature controls whether a young alligator will be male or female (temperature-dependent sex determination), a feature present in many other reptiles. A higher incubation temperature also increases the hatching rate. Young hatch in September, assisted by their mothers. Young alligators, such as this one, are covered with light spots. Newborn alligators, like their eggs, are the smallest of any crocodilian, with a length of and weight of . Unlike adults, they have light speckles on their bodies and heads. Mothers help them leave the nest and bring them to the water after hatching. They grow very little in their first year, due to being able to feed for only about 2 months after hatching before the winter. A 2002 study showed that the Chinese alligator is two-thirds the length of the American alligator and one-half its weight at birth, but is one- half its length and one-tenth its weight after one year. Young depend on their mothers to protect them during their first winter, as their small size makes them an easy prey target. The alligator grows quickly in its first few years, with its growth rate slowing at age five. According to the National Zoological Park, females reach maturity roughly four to five years after birth, although other sources estimate that they mature at age six to seven. It can live to over 50 years, and has been known to reach age 70 in captivity. It cannot breed past its 50s. = Feeding = The Chinese alligator is an opportunistic feeder, meaning that it can prey on a variety of different animals depending on what is available. It is a carnivore, mostly eating fish and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insects, and snails. When possible, it eats rodents and aquatic birds as well. It has dull teeth, which allow it to eat prey with shells more easily. A study of the alligator in 1985 showed that snails were the most common animal in its diet at 63%, with 65% of that being river snails and 35% spiral-shelled snails. According to the survey, its diet also contained 16% rabbits, 8.3% mollusks, and 4.1% shrimp, with the remaining 6.8% being frogs, fish, and insects. = Vocalization = The Chinese alligator is a vocal species, making many different sounds in multiple situations. When communicating with nearby alligators, it produces sounds such as head slapping, hissing, and whining, which have a low sound pressure level (SPL). To communicate long-distance, it produces bellows, which have a high SPL. All of these sounds have a low frequency of less than 500 hertz, due to the alligator's densely vegetated habitat, which allow the sounds to spread across a greater area. Both sexes participate in bellowing choruses during the mating season as adults. Lasting an average of 10 minutes, the alligators remain still for the entirety of the chorus, with both sexes responding equally in rough unison. The main purpose of these bellows is to call out to alligator specimens to collect at a specific pond, where individuals choose mates and engage in copulation. Alligators may also bellow to publicize their size, a behavior which occurs in multiple other vertebrates. The size of a specimen is a significant factor for mating; females only mate with males larger than themselves. Bellowing is most common at 6:00‚Äì7:00 am and 11:00‚Äì12:00 am CST. Although these bellows occur most frequently during the mating season, adults also bellow throughout the rest of the year. Young Chinese alligators often communicate with each other and their parents using vocal signals to \\"maintain group cohesion\\". Young also make sounds when in danger, which alert adults to help and caution nearby young of the threat. Embryos produce distinctive sounds inside their eggs, which alert the adult female that the nest is ready to be opened. These vocalizations are high-pitched, while their danger calls are louder.  Distribution and population  The range of the Chinese alligator is extremely restricted; as of 2015, the only places it is confirmed to live in the wild are Xuancheng, Nanling County, Jing County, Wuhu, Langxi County, and Guangde County ‚Äì six counties and cities in the province of Anhui, occupying a total area of about . It has been reported to rarely occur in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but it is unknown whether it still lives there. It is the only species in the family Alligatoridae that lives on a continent other than North or South America. = Habitat = The habitat of the Chinese alligator is fresh water bodies, as pictured. The habitat of the Chinese alligator is bodies of fresh water, particularly wetlands and ponds, in areas transitioning between subtropical and tropical climates. It lives at the base of mountains, in areas where grass and shrubs are common. Habitat loss has also forced it to live at higher elevations than it prefers, where the weather is colder and the soil is unfit for burrow digging. Crocodilian conservationist John Thorbjarnarson observed a female who had to build her nest of pine needles rather than the usual plants; the eggs died due to the pine needles not being able to warm them properly. = Population and range trend = The oldest record of the Chinese alligator is a skeleton fragment found in western Japan. The fossil is estimated to be from the late Pliocene period, 3 million years ago (Mya). The skeleton showed that the species was larger at the time than it is currently, with a total length of at least . Alligators are believed to have moved into various parts of Japan either before 25 Mya or after 10 Mya and were extirpated from there during the Plio- Pleistocene period, due to Japan's increased isolation from the continent and harsh climate conditions. The population of the Chinese alligator began to decline in 5000 BC, when human civilization started to grow in China, after having been very abundant in the lower Yangtze area. This area was one of the first places in the world to farm rice, causing much of the alligator's habitat to be destroyed in favor of rice farms. In the 1700s, much of the Chinese alligator's habitat was replaced with farming fields after a large number of people had moved into the area. By the 20th century, its range was reduced to a few small areas around the Yangtze. In the 1950s, the alligator was in three distinct areas: the southern area of the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) from Pengze to the western shore of Lake Tai (Tai Hu), the mountainous regions of southern Anhui, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, primarily in lakes, streams, and marshes. By the 1970s, it was restricted to small parts of southern Anhui and Zhejiang, at which time the population was about 1,000. In 1998, the population of the Chinese alligator was the lowest it had ever been; the largest area it lived in was a small pond along the Yangtze surrounded by farmland, which held 11 alligators. In 1999, the Wildlife Conservation Society estimated that 130‚Äì150 individuals were left in the wild. According to The New York Times, the population was less than 130 in 2001; at this time, alligators sometimes wandered around to look for a suitable habitat, but were unsuccessful due to their habitat having been turned into rice fields. In 2003, the population began to gradually increase after having been roughly stable between 1998 and 2003. A survey of the population by the Anhui National Nature Reserve for Chinese Alligator (ANNRCA) in 2005 deduced that between 92 and 114 adults and 66 young remained in the wild. The survey reasoned that the species' population was growing in four sites, but stable in the rest of the alligator's range. A 2012 journal article estimated the population at the time to be 120‚Äì150. A 2015 survey observed 64 individuals, of which 32 were adults, estimating that the total number of adults was 68‚Äì86 and the total population 136‚Äì173. Wang Renping, the head of the ANNRCA, stated in 2017 that about 300 specimens existed in the wild, some of which had been born captive and reintroduced to the wild. As of 2018 the population is not considered to be further declining. = Reasons for population decline = A Chinese alligator among a field of grass and a small body of water Considered to be one of the most endangered crocodilians in the world, the Chinese alligator's biggest threats in the late 20th century were human killing and habitat loss. A majority of the species' wetland habitats were destroyed to construct rice paddies and dams. During the 1970s and 1980s, humans sometimes killed the alligators, because they believed they were pests, out of fear, or for their meat. Their meat was thought to have the ability to cure colds and prevent cancer and their organs were sold for medicinal purposes. In several restaurants and food centers in China's more prosperous areas, young alligators were allowed to roam free with their mouths taped shut, and were subsequently killed for human consumption, served as a dish of rice, vegetables, and chopped up alligator flesh. In the late 20th century, people living in the range of the Chinese alligator ate its meat due to believing that it was dragon meat. The Yangtze was flooded in the winter of 1957, which is believed to have caused many Chinese alligators to drown. Rats, which this species eat, have been poisoned by farmers, so were also a cause for the diminishing of the species. The organochlorine compound sodium pentachlorophenate was used to kill snails in agricultural fields starting in 1958, which incidentally poisoned the alligators as well. Other factors that led to the endangerment of the alligator include natural disasters and geographic separation.  Status and conservation  In its native country, the Chinese alligator has been listed as a Class I endangered species since 1972, which gives it the highest possible degree of legal protection and makes killing or capturing the species in the wild forbidden. It is listed as a CITES Appendix I species and an endangered species by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Following six assessments as endangered from 1982 to 1994, it is classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List as of 2017. In 1982, the Anhui National Nature Reserve for Chinese Alligator (ANNRCA) was created, a reserve spanning across the entire range of the Chinese alligator, now covering an area of . = In captivity = Chinese alligators at Shanghai Zoo As of 2016, at least 20,000 Chinese alligators are living in captivity due to captive-breeding programs, the first initiated in the 1970s. Captive-born Chinese alligators have been reintroduced into their native range, boosting the wild population. Six specimens were released from captivity in 2007, followed by six more in June 2015. As of June 2016, the largest group of Chinese alligators to have been released in the wild was when 18 specimens were reintroduced to Langxi County, part of the species' native habitat, on May 22, 2016. These releases have proven successful, with individuals adapting well to a life in the wild and breeding. A year after the 2007 release, 16 young alligators were found living in the wild. 60 alligator eggs were observed in 2016, distributed in three nests at a wetland park. Although a typhoon in September the same year flooded and eliminated two of the nests, three hatchlings were found in the same area several days after.  China  The two largest breeding centers for the Chinese alligator are in, or near, the areas where Chinese alligators are still found in the wild. The Anhui Research Center for Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) is the largest of them, housing roughly 15,000 Chinese alligators as of 2016. The center is from the city of Xuancheng, where it makes use of a series of ponds in a small valley. Founded in 1979, the ARCCAR was stocked with 212 alligators collected from the wild over the first decade after its establishment, and received alligator eggs collected by the area's residents and the ARCCAR's own staff from the nests of wild alligators as well. In 1988, the first eggs by human-bred alligators were laid. The reserve decided to reintroduce some of its alligators in the wild in 2001, which was carried out in 2003 when three alligators were released. The alligator breeding was so successful that the ARCCAR began to use the alligators for local meat consumption and live animals for the European pet market, with the profits from these activities continuing to fund the breeding centers. The other major breeding center for the species is the Changxing Chinese Alligator Nature Reserve (CCANR) or Changxing Nature Reserve and Breeding Center for Chinese Alligators (CNRBRCCA), in Changxing County, Zhejiang, about east of the ARCCAR. Originally known as the Yinjiabian Alligator Conservation Area (Â∞πÂÆ∂ËæπÊâ¨Â≠êÈ≥Ñ‰øùÊä§Âå∫), the breeding center was established in 1982. Unlike the ARCCAR, where alligator eggs are collected by the center's staff for incubation in controlled condition, the CCANR allows eggs to hatch naturally. According to a 2013 official report, the CCANR housed almost 4,000 alligators, including 2,089 young (1‚Äì3 years old), 1,598 juveniles (4‚Äì12 years old), and 248 adults (13+ years old). By 2016, 5,500 specimens were housed at the center. In 2003, the ARCCAR received a donation of $1.2 million from the State Forestry and Grassland Administration of China (SFGA) and $740,000 from the government of Anhui. This allowed the organization to create two new breeding areas to hold the alligators, each, as well as heighten the existing fence. The same year, the CCANR received a donation of $600,000 from the SFGA and $800,000 from the government of Changxing, enabling it to reinstate wetlands for the alligators and enhance its facilities. Both the ARCCAR and the CCANR position themselves as tourist attractions, where paying visitors can view alligators and learn about them. Multiple other breeding facilities that house the Chinese alligator exist in various provinces of China, as well as private breeding farms and museums.  Foreign countries  The Chinese alligator in the Smithsonian National Zoological Park The Chinese alligator is also kept and bred at many zoos and aquariums in North America and Europe. Some individuals bred there have been returned to China for reintroduction to the wild. The first time the alligators were ever transported internationally is believed to have been when several were taken from China to the United States in the 1950s. In November 2017, four Chinese alligators were transported from their natural habitat in China to Shizuoka, Japan. Among the North American zoos and aquariums keeping this species are the Bronx Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo, Great Plains Zoo, Sedgwick County Zoo, Philadelphia Zoo, San Diego Zoo, Santa Barbara Zoo, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and St. Louis Zoo. In Europe, about 25 zoos and aquariums keep the species, such as the Barcelona Zoo (Spain), Bioparco di Roma (Italy), Crocodile Zoo (Denmark), Moscow Zoo (Russia), Pairi Daiza (Belgium), Paradise Wildlife Park (England), Parken Zoo (Sweden), Prague Zoo (Czech Republic), Tallinn Zoo (Estonia) and Tierpark Berlin (Germany).  Chinese dragon association  The Chinese dragon in Haikou, Hainan, China Some writers have suggested that the Chinese alligator was the inspiration for the Chinese dragon. This theory was widespread in the early 1900s, and the idea was later revisited by John Thorbjarnarson and Xiaoming Wang. According to The New York Times, the association with the \\"beneficent\\" mythological creature is an advantage for the species. Unlike dragons in myths of the Western Hemisphere, the Chinese dragon is portrayed as a symbol of \\"royal power and good fortune\\", frequently helping and saving people. It is able to swim in waterbody or in air The relatively harmless nature of the Chinese alligator is believed to have been an influence for the helpful nature of the dragon. The fact that the alligator ends its brumation when the rainy season begins and returns to its burrows when the rainwater in rivers recedes, as well as the fact that it lives in bodies of water, may be the reason for the dragon's portrayal as a water- related mythological creature. Alligator drums may have been used to simulate the species' vocalizations during the mating season, which humans associated with the dragon's \\"power of summoning rainclouds\\".

The school is affiliated to the Anglican church.  About  Whanganui Collegiate School was founded as Wanganui Collegiate School by a land grant in 1852 by the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey, to the Bishop of New Zealand, George Augustus Selwyn, for the purpose of establishing a school. It was originally a boys-only school but in 1991 began admitting girls at senior levels and went fully co-educational in 1999. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004. St George‚Äôs School moved to the Collegiate campus in 2010. The combined schools provide primary education for day students on the St George campus, and secondary education for day and boarding students on the Collegiate campus. Collegiate is an International Member of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) which represents heads of the leading independent schools in Ireland, the United Kingdom and international schools mainly from the Commonwealth. Whanganui Collegiate is one of only three member schools in New Zealand. Since 2019, Collegiate has been one of three Round Square schools in New Zealand along with King's College and Christ's College. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, spent two terms in 1982 at the school as a junior master during his gap year. In November 2012, it was announced that the school would integrate into the state system effective January 2013, after requiring a $3.8 million bailout from the government to stay afloat. In January 2019, the Whanganui Collegiate School Board of Trustees and Whanganui College Board of Trustees unanimously voted to add an 'h' to the spelling of 'Wanganui', following other local organisations and secondary schools after the Whanganui District was similarly renamed in November 2015.  School life  As a boarding school, the house system plays a significant role in student life. Each house (of which there are 6 in total; four for boys and two for girls) accommodates approximately 80 students, and each has its own Housemaster, Assistant Housemaster and Matron. The school houses are named Harvey, Hadfield, Grey, Selwyn, Godwin and Bishops. The school grounds also host numerous sporting facilities, including the Izard Gymnasium, High Performance Cricket Centre, A Water Surface Hockey turf a full-sized Cross Country Course and many team sports fields. The nearby Whanganui River is used by students for rowing training and competitions; Rowing being one of the sports in which Collegiate has traditionally excelled, having won the Maadi Cup 17 times, a national record. The Collegiate women's squad had a particularly strong year in 2006 when it won the most prestigious women's race in the lower north Island, the Levin Jubilee Trophy, for the first time.https://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Magnificent-final-day-at-the- Maadi-Cup/-22683?source=google Unfortunately, such success could not be replicated on the national stage, with the u18 girls eight only managing bronze in the penultimate race of the 2007 Maadi Cup.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui- chronicle/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503424&objectid;=10953843 The School also hosts the nationally popular Whanganui Cricket Festival each year which sees over 1000 cricketers display their skills throughout the month of January. Since 1925, the school's 'First XV' rugby team has played Christ's College, Wellington College and Nelson College in an annual quadrangular rugby tournament, this Tournament is played at a different school every year playing at Collegiate once every four years. In recent times, this tournament has been dominated by Wellington College. Whanganui Collegiate last won in 1991.

Widely considered the most outstanding baroque church in Vienna, as well as one of the city's greatest buildings, the church is dedicated to Saint Charles Borromeo, one of the great counter-reformers of the sixteenth century.Brook 2012, pp. 146‚Äì147. Located on the edge of the Innere Stadt, approximately 200 meters outside the Ringstra√üe, the church contains a dome in the form of an elongated ellipsoid.  History  In 1713, one year after the last great plague epidemic, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, pledged to build a church for his namesake patron saint, Charles Borromeo, who was revered as a healer for plague sufferers. An architectural competition was announced, in which Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach prevailed over, among others, Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. Construction began in 1716 under the supervision of Anton Erhard Martinelli. After J.B. Fischer's death in 1723, his son, Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, completed the construction in 1737 using partially altered plans. The church originally possessed a direct line of sight to the Hofburg and was also, until 1918, the imperial patron parish church. As a creator of historic architecture, the elder Fischer von Erlach united the most diverse of elements. The fa√ßade in the center, which leads to the porch, corresponds to a Greek temple portico. The neighboring two columns, crafted by Lorenzo Mattielli, found a model in Trajan's Column in Rome. Next to those, two tower pavilions extend out and show the influence of the Roman baroque (Bernini and Borromini). Above the entrance, a dome rises up above a high drum, which the younger J.E. Fischer shortened and partly altered. Next to the Church was the Spitaler Gottesacker. The composer Antonio Vivaldi died in Vienna and was buried there on July 28, 1741 but his tomb has been lost over time. The church hosts regular Vivaldi concerts in his honour. Hedwig Kiesler (age 19), later American movie actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr, married Friedrich Mandl (age 32), businessman and Austrofascist, in the tiny chapel of this elaborate church on 10 August 1933. With over 200 prominent guests attending, Kiesler wore ‚Äúa black-and-white print dress‚Äù and carried ‚Äúa bouquet of white orchids.‚ÄùThe book ‚ÄúBeautiful,‚Äù p. 39, by Stephen Michael Shearer. Since Karlsplatz was restored as an ensemble in the late 1980s, the church has garnered fame because of its dome and its two flanking columns of bas-reliefs, as well as its role as an architectural counterweight to the buildings of the Musikverein and of the Vienna University of Technology. The church is cared for by a religious order, the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, and has long been the parish church as well as the seat of the Catholic student ministry of the Vienna University of Technology. Iconography The iconographical program of the church originated from the imperial official Carl Gustav Heraeus and connects Saint Charles Borromeo with his imperial benefactor. The relief on the pediment above the entrance with the cardinal virtues and the figure of the patron on its apex point to the motivation of the donation. This sculpture group continues onto the attic story as well. The attic is also one of the elements which the younger Fischer introduced. The columns display scenes from the life of Charles Borromeo in a spiral relief and are intended to recall the two columns, Boaz and Jachim, that stood in front of the Temple at Jerusalem. They also recall the Pillars of Hercules and act as symbols of imperial power. The entrance is flanked by angels from the Old and New Testaments. This program continues in the interior as well, above all in the dome fresco by Johann Michael Rottmayr of Salzburg and Gaetano Fanti, which displays an intercession of Charles Borromeo, supported by the Virgin Mary. Surrounding this scene are the cardinal virtues. The frescos in a number of side chapels are attributed to Daniel Gran. The high altarpiece portraying the ascension of the saint was conceptualized by the elder Fischer and executed by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff. The altar paintings in the side chapels are by various artists, including Daniel Gran, Sebastiano Ricci, Martino Altomonte and Jakob van Schuppen. A wooden statue of St. Anthony by Josef Josephu is also on display. As strong effect emanates from the directing of light and architectural grouping, in particular the arch openings of the main axis. The color scheme is characterized by marble with sparring and conscious use of gold leaf. The large round glass window high above the main altar with the Hebrew Tetragrammaton/Yahweh symbolizes God's omnipotence and simultaneously, through its warm yellow tone, God's love. Below is a representation of Apotheosis of Saint Charles Borromeo. Next to the structures at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, which maintain this form but are more fragmented, the church is Fischer's greatest work. It is also an expression of the Austrian joie de vivre stemming from the victorious end of the Turkish Wars. Pulpit The pulpit of the church was probably designed by Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, and his plans might have been executed by a French furniture maker, Claude Le Fort du Plessy in 1735 although there are no surviving documents attesting their authorship or the manufacturing of the church furniture.Marek Puƒçal√≠k: \\"Ihr sehet nehmlich einen Templ, desgleichen ihr vielleicht selten, oder vielleicht niemals gesehen.\\" Zur Ikonographie der Wiener Karlskirche, in: Orbis artium. K jubileu Lubom√≠ra Slav√≠ƒçka, Brno, Masarykova univerzita, 2009, p. 566 It is a wooden structure with rich floral, vegetal, rosette and rocaille ornaments, the finer carvings made of hard walnut, in a gold and brown colour scheme. The abat-voix forms a theatrical canopy with two putti holding a cross and a chalice with host; there is a flaming urn on the top. Around 1860 the abat-voix was enlarged. A wide rim was added distorting the original proportions, obscuring the elegant, swirling lines and creating a top-heavy effect. In 2006-2007 this rim was removed after a long debate and the pulpit was restored.

It is part of the United Nations system, serving as the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization and as the health organization of the Inter-American System. It is known in Latin America as the OPS or OPAS (; ).  Description  PAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the Americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO's Member States set PAHO's technical and administrative policies through its Governing Bodies. PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; Puerto Rico is an Associate Member. France, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are Participating States, and Portugal and Spain are Observer States. The Organization's essential mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others. PAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and strengthening of health systems based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, dengue, HIV and tuberculosis as well as the region's growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in technical cooperation with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence Informed Policy Network - EVIPNet Evipnet. In its efforts to improve health, PAHO targets the most vulnerable groups including mothers and children, workers, the poor, the elderly, and refugees and displaced persons. It focuses on issues related to equity for those who lack access to health, and on a Pan American approach, encouraging countries to work together on common issues and build lasting capacities. Specific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the Expanded Program on Immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors. A major priority for the Americas is cutting infant mortality, and PAHO is mobilizing new political, institutional and financial resources to prevent an additional 25,000 infant deaths every year through application of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy, a simple and practical approach in which primary health care workers are taught a complete process to evaluate the health status of children brought to a health post or clinic. They learn to recognize signs of disease and evaluate and treat them. They learn to give parents information on how to prevent disease in the home. If they see danger signs indicating the infant could die, they are taught to treat the child immediately or take him or her to a hospital. Improvement of drinking water supplies, adequate sanitation, and increased access to health care for the poor are still top priorities for PAHO, with a focus on equity. The Organization is intensifying its efforts to have countries know the true state of health of their populations and where the inequalities lie. Program efforts focus on correcting inequality, taking into account decentralization and change of state functions, on showing that health has a role to play in the success of other sectors, and on how attention to health affects positively other aspects of human development. Advocacy in this area is also directed to reducing pernicious gender inequity, which reflects in some health problems of women. The Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of Panamericanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean Region, and the Southern Cone. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after hurricane Mitch, and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called \\"Health Technology Linking the Americas.\\" The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund, bringing them tangible benefits and helping advance PAHO's efforts to eliminate or control vaccine-preventable diseases. These are among the Organization's most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973; a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease. A major effort committing the Americas to embark on polio eradication in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the Americas was identified August 23, 1991 in a young boy named Luis Ferm√≠n Tenorio Cortez, in Jun√≠n, Peru. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of polio have been detected anywhere in the Americas, and the World Health Organization is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all vaccine-preventable diseases. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating measles from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as Haemophilus influenzae B. to reduce meningitis and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from diarrheal diseases, including cholera, through case management and oral rehydration therapy to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year. PAHO disseminates scientific and technical information through its publications program, its Internet site , and a network of academic libraries, documentation centers, and local health care libraries. The Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields, and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control malaria, Chagas' disease, urban rabies, leprosy, and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including protein-energy malnutrition, and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies. It engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents, smoking, addiction to drugs and alcohol, and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic. The Organization also executes projects for other United Nations agencies, for international organizations such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for philanthropic foundations. PAHO strengthens the health sector capacity in the countries to advance their priority programs through intersectoral action, promoting an integral approach to health problems. It also works to improve women's health, promoting the greater integration of women in society, as well as awareness of their importance as both recipients and providers of health services. PAHO trains health workers at all levels, through fellowships, courses and seminars, and the strengthening of national training institutions. It leads in the use of advanced communications technologies for information, health promotion, and education, working with journalists in many countries. The Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services, and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax- deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the Americas may be made to the PAHO Foundation. Dr. Carissa F. Etienne of the Commonwealth of Dominica was elected as the new director of PAHO on January 31, 2013. PAHO's Deputy Director is Dr. Mary Lou Valdez, of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Jarbas Barbosa,https://www.paho.org/hq3/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=14529:brazilian- doctor-appointed-assistant-director-of-paho&Itemid;=135‚ü®=en from Brazil. History The organization was founded in December 1902. It was originally called the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau. In 1949, PAHO and WHO signed an agreement making PAHO the American Regional Office (AMRO) of WHO. Today the usual phrasing is \\"Regional Office for the Americas\\". Headquarters building Pan American Health Organization building, Washington, DC Stage of the Pan-American Health Organization building Auditorium in Washington, DC In March 1960, President Eisenhower signed into law a bill passed by the U.S. Congress Authorized by Public Law 86-395, March 28, 1960; funding subsequently appropriated by Public Law 86-678, August 31, 1960. authorizing the U.S. government to purchase and donate a lot for the PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C. At the meeting of its Executive Committee in April 1960, the PAHO decided to accept the USG's offer and set forth parameters for proceeding with the project of a new headquarters building. PAHO decided to use an international open competition as the means of selecting an architect for the project, following the recently successful model of other international organizations (most notably the United Nations New York headquarters inaugurated in 1952, and the UNESCO Paris headquarters in 1953 ‚Äì both resulting in landmark designs of modernist architecture). PAHO framed the competition based on standards developed by the International Union of Architects, and determined that the competition should be open to architects from all countries of the Americas. The vision was that ‚Äúthe new building should be a monument to international health cooperation.‚ÄùReport on Buildings and Headquarters (Document CE41/3; July 29, 1960), Submitted to the 41st meeting of the Executive Committee meeting of the Pan American Health Organization. Following a review of 58 entries,Quadrennial Report of the PAHO Director, July 1962, p. 78. the PAHO in October 1961 declared Uruguayan architect Rom√°n Fresnedo Siri the winner of its competition. At the ceremony announcing him as winner, the organization's Director Abraham Horwitz said ‚Äúthis beautiful building will become a monument to the ideal of better health for the peoples of the Americas.‚Äù He described the winning design as one of ‚Äúboth grace and utility,‚Äù and said ‚Äúit reflects the high ideals of the Pan- American spirit in an age when we must move ahead to build a better future for our peoples.‚ÄùFrom the PAHO press release commemorating the 50th anniversary of the building, September 28, 2015. The building was designed in a modernist style by Fresnedo Siri in part as a tribute to Le Corbusier, a key influence on Fresnedo Siri's work. Constructed in 1965, the exterior features 29 round bronze seals of the founding nations of the Pan American Health Organization set in black stone. Each medallion is in diameter and were designed by American sculptor Michael Lantz. They were originally meant to be carved in granite. The east side of the south facade (left to right) seals are for: France, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The west side of the south facade seals are for: Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and El Salvador. In 1993 the seals were surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and were described as needing conservation treatment. The building is situated on a triangular lot of just over one acre nestled between Virginia Avenue, E Street and 23rd Street, Northwest, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington. Constructed of reinforced concrete over a steel frame with an exterior of glass and marble, the building is one of Washington's most recognized examples of midcentury modern architecture. The building is divided into two distinct volumes: a gracefully curved ten-story building that hosts the organization's main offices, and an adjoining four-story cylindrical annex that serves as the congress hall for formal assemblies of the PAHO member state delegates, as well as other meetings and events. It is surrounded by George Washington University to the north and east, the Columbia Plaza office/residential complex to the west, and the State Department to the south across the E street expressway underpass. The main building features soaring white vertical columnar ribs evenly separating dark vertical columns of glass. There are no horizontal lines to compete with the vertical symmetry; the building's vertical ribs disappear along ‚Äúblind gables‚Äù into an invisible roofline. In the formalism and attention to symmetry, Fresnedo Siri said he was trying to stay true to the ‚Äúclassic spirit of the city of Washington.‚Äù‚ÄúSpace Squeeze Put on New Health Building Mars Its Beauty: A Critique,‚Äù by Wolf Von Eckardt, Washington Post Staff Writer, The Washington Post, Sep 27, 1965, p. A3 The interplay of light and dark is accentuated by the use of white American marble, black Mexican granite, and dark gray glass. The building's slender, windowless west and east sides are clad in the white marble, while the black granite frames all the ground floor elements, including the entry portico, the hidden downward ramp to an underground garage, and the reflecting pool and garden elements. Fresnedo Siri placed the main building on 20 rounded pilotis (columns) that lift it a full story above ground level. He employed this signature element of midcentury modernist design to maximize the open pedestrian plaza space on the relatively small and unusually shaped lot, while enhancing visual transparency and flow. He added reflecting pools with fountains at the base of each building ‚Äì his vision was that the cylindrical congress hall in particular would appear to be ‚Äúemerging from the water.‚ÄùArticadi, Juan, Propuestas Urbanas de Roman Fresnedo Siri, (Doctoral thesis, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and Universidad de la Republica ‚Äì Uruguay, 2004), p. 27. The thin vertical streams spurting up from the fountains would echo the symmetry of the columns and vertical ribbing of the main building. A row of 42 flag poles (representing each PAHO member state) reinforces still further the building's dancing array of vertical symmetries, while also gracefully delineating the northeastern edge of the property site. Unfortunately, the reflecting pools years later were eliminated, filled in and replaced by garden plots. Fresnedo Siri purposefully placed the convex side of the curved main office building to the north, smoothly integrating it into the urban streetscape of similarly sized office, university and residential buildings. This allowed the concave side of the building to face the open side of the lot, gently cradling the congress hall annex while framing the contours of the small but appealing pedestrian plaza area that flows toward the site's open southern side. The cylindrical annex's round central congress hall is about in diameter and seats up to 300 people. The single open space soars upward, filling the top three levels of the building. Fresnedo Siri designed a dramatic spider web-like steel structure to support the building, allowing the entire interior space to be free of any supporting columns.The steel for the spider-web like structure that sustains the cylindrical conference center came from Mimsco Steel Corporation of Lorton, VA and was erected by the Heron Todd Steel Construction Company of Arlington, VA (source: The Washington Evening Star, October 30, 1964, p. F-1) The resulting internal space, naturally lit by windows throughout the cylinder's full 360 degrees, achieves an impressive sense of openness and purity of design. The cylindrical building is encased on the outside by a lattice-like grill of diamond-shaped hexagons composed of white marble, quartz and Portland cement. The recessed ground floor space of the cylinder is encased in the same Mexican black granite used for all the site's ground level elements, creating a striking contrast with the white honeycomb grill of the upper levels it supports. After studying the main diplomatic congress halls at the UN, State Department, the OAS and elsewhere, Fresnedo Siri devised a ‚Äúfloating seat‚Äù solution for the chairs in the PAHO's hall. The seats are all anchored to the floor in the rear to curved latitudinal support elements running behind each row (and serving as hidden conduits for the simultaneous translation cabling), achieving what he described as ‚Äúa great functional and aesthetic purity.‚Äù All of the furnishings for the main halls and meeting rooms were designed under his specifications by Knoll Associates, a leading New York-based producer of modernist furniture including landmark designs of the era like the Saarinen womb chair and Mies Van de Rohe's Barcelona chair. Fresnedo Siri designed the magisterial backdrop to the presidium of the Congress hall, using vertical slats of six different woods including Honduran mahogany, Brazilian jacaranda, American walnut and oak, arranged in his words ‚Äúto accentuate the dimension of the space and the importance of the function it served.‚ÄùQuote and other details from Boronat, Y. and Risso, M., Rom√°n Fresnedo Siri, un Arquitecto Uruguayo. Montevideo: Editora de la Universidad de la Rep√∫blica, Facultad de Arquitectura, Instituto de Historia de la Arquitectura (1980), p.108 Fresnedo Siri also designed the central chandelier of the Congress hall, calling the piece ‚Äúa sculpture in light.‚Äù Measuring 20 feet in diameter and weighing , it consisted of 3000 long rectangular pieces of Lucite, the translucent acrylic resin invented by Dupont in the 1930s for industrial and military uses then enjoying an early-60's boom as a ‚Äúspace age‚Äù material for vanguard furniture and art.PAHO Report on Buildings and Installations, April 16, 1966  Public Health Heroes of the Americas  PAHO recognizes individuals as \\"Public Health Heroes\\" to honour noteworthy contributions to public health in the Americas.

She was laid down in 1943 and launched on 19 June 1944 as Rayleigh Castle (K695), but further work was then cancelled, and she was completed as a convoy rescue ship on 26 October 1944. Under the ownership of the Ministry of War Transport, and managed by the Ellerman City Line, she sailed on eleven convoys between November 1944 and June 1945, but made no rescues. In November 1945 she sailed to Kiel to repatriate Royal Navy personnel, and was also employed as an transport ship in the Mediterranean in 1947, taking illegal Jewish immigrants from Haifa to internment camps on Cyprus in October that year.

NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and Wilhelmina Holladay. Since opening its doors in 1987, the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by Mary Cassatt, Frida Kahlo, and √âlisabeth Louise Vig√©e-Le Brun. The museum occupies the old Masonic Temple, a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art. It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art. The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under- representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions. Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by Clara Peeters that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist. They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center. The National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection. After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition \\"American Women Artists, 1830‚Äì1930\\". To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich to write Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert. In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people. =Building= In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works. After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility . Interior of the main floor =Wilhelmina Cole Holladay= Wilhelmina Cole Holladay is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods. Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. Girl Scouts of the USA), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe. Wilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at Elmira College in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the University of Paris. She is listed in Who's Who of American Women, Who's Who in American Art, Who's Who in the World, and she holds many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the National Medal of Arts from the United States and the L√©gion d'honneur from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the National Arts Club in New York City. =New York Avenue Sculpture Project= By 2015, a selection of sculptures will be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of Mount Vernon Square. The museums efforts are in part to bring \\"character\\" to an area where \\"there is a lot of good stuff going on,\\" due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood. Niki de Saint Phalle's works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations. The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into \\"sculpture islands,\\" as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director Susan Fisher Sterling. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant. The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 ‚Äì March 9, 2014, was Chakaia Booker. The project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others. These works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation. Collection Camille Claudel, Young Girl with a Sheaf, ca. 1890 The collection currently contains more than 4,500 works in a variety of styles and media, spanning from the 16th century to present day. Among the earliest works is Lavinia Fontana‚Äôs Portrait of a Noblewoman, ca. 1580. There are also a number of special collections, including 18th-century botanical prints, works by British and Irish women silversmiths from the 17th‚Äì19th centuries, and more than 1,000 unique and limited edition artists‚Äô books.

Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center  The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities. It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women. Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work. In spring 2007, the LRC launched \\"Clara: Database of Women Artists,\\" a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved. Exhibitions Beginning in 1987 with American Women Artists, 1830‚Äì1930, NMWA has presented more than 200 exhibitions.

It is matter composed of organic compounds that have come from the remains of organisms such as plants and animals and their waste products in the environment. Organic molecules can also be made by chemical reactions that don't involve life. Basic structures are created from cellulose, tannin, cutin, and lignin, along with other various proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Organic matter is very important in the movement of nutrients in the environment and plays a role in water retention on the surface of the planet. Formation Living organisms are composed of organic compounds. In life they secrete or excrete organic materials into their environment, shed body parts such as leaves and roots and after organisms die, their bodies are broken down by bacterial and fungal action. Larger molecules of organic matter can be formed from the polymerization of different parts of already broken down matter. The composition of natural organic matter depends on its origin, transformation mode, age, and existing environment, thus its bio-physico-chemical functions vary with different environments.Nicola Senesi, Baoshan Xing, and P.M. Huang, Biophysico-Chemical Processes Involving Natural Nonlifiidulfitving Organic Matter in Environmental Systems, New York: IUPAC, 2006. Natural ecosystem functions Organic matter is common throughout the ecosystem and is cycled through decomposition processes by soil microbial communities that are crucial for nutrient availability. After degrading and reacting, it can move into soil and mainstream water via waterflow. Organic matter provides nutrition to living organisms. Organic matter acts as a buffer in aqueous solution to maintain a neutral pH in the environment. The buffer acting component has been proposed to be relevant for neutralizing acid rain.Steve Cabaniss, Greg Madey, Patricia Maurice, Yingping Zhou, Laura Leff, Olacheesy head Bob Wetzel, Jerry Leenheer, and Bob Wershaw, comps, Stochastic Synthesis of Natural Organic Matter, UNM, ND, KSU, UNC, USGS, 22 Apr 2007. Source cycle A majority of organic matter not already in the soil comes from groundwater. When the groundwater saturates the soil or sediment around it, organic matter can freely move between the phases. Groundwater has its own sources of natural organic matter also: * \\"organic matter deposits, such as kerogen and coal. * soil and sediment organic matter. * organic matter infiltrating into the subsurface from rivers, lakes, and marine systems.\\" One source of groundwater organic matter is soil organic matter and sedimentary organic matter. The major method of movement into soil is from groundwater, but organic matter from soil moves into groundwater as well. Most of the matter in lakes, rivers, and surface water areas comes from deteriorated material in the water and surrounding shores, and some from groundwater. This movement enables a cycle to form. Organisms decompose into organic matter, which is then transported and recycled. Not all biomass migrates, some is rather stationary, turning only over the course of millions of years.Tori M. Hoehler & Bo Barker J√∏rgensen \\"Microbial life under extreme energy limitation\\" Nature Reviews Microbiology 2013, vol 11, p 83 Soil organic matter The organic matter in soil derives from plants, animals and microorganisms. In a forest, for example, leaf litter and woody material falls to the forest floor. This is sometimes referred to as organic material. When it decays to the point in which it is no longer recognizable, it is called soil organic matter. When the organic matter has broken down into a stable substance that resist further decomposition it is called humus. Thus soil organic matter comprises all of the organic matter in the soil exclusive of the material that has not decayed. An important property of soil organic matter is that it improves the capacity of a soil to hold water and nutrients, and allows their slow release, thereby improving the conditions for plant growth. Another advantage of humus is that it helps the soil to stick together which allows nematodes, or microscopic bacteria, to easily decay the nutrients in the soil.Crow, W. T. ‚ÄúOrganic Matter, Green Manures and Cover Crops For Nematode Management.‚Äù University of Florida. The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Feb. 2009 Web 10 October 2009 There are several ways to quickly increase the amount of humus. Combining compost, plant or animal materials/waste, or green manure with soil will increase the amount of humus in the soil. # Compost: decomposed organic material. # Plant and animal material and waste: dead plants or plant waste such as leaves or bush and tree trimmings, or animal manure. # Green manure: plants or plant material that is grown for the sole purpose of being incorporated with soil. These three materials supply nematodes and bacteria with nutrients for them to thrive and produce more humus, which will give plants enough nutrients to survive and grow. =Priming effect= The priming effect is characterized by intense changes in the natural process of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, resulting from relatively moderate intervention with the soil. The phenomenon is generally caused by either pulsed or continuous changes to inputs of fresh organic matter (FOM). Priming effects usually result in an acceleration of mineralization due to a trigger such as the FOM inputs. The cause of this increase in decomposition has often been attributed to an increase in microbial activity resulting from higher energy and nutrient availability released from the FOM. After the input of FOM, specialized microorganisms are believed to grow quickly and only decompose this newly added organic matter. The turnover rate of SOM in these areas is at least one order of magnitude higher than the bulk soil. Other soil treatments, besides organic matter inputs, which lead to this short-term change in turnover rates, include \\"input of mineral fertilizer, exudation of organic substances by roots, mere mechanical treatment of soil or its drying and rewetting.\\" Priming effects can be either positive or negative depending on the reaction of the soil with the added substance. A positive priming effect results in the acceleration of mineralization while a negative priming effect results in immobilization, leading to N unavailability. Although most changes have been documented in C and N pools, the priming effect can also be found in phosphorus and sulfur, as well as other nutrients. L√∂hnis was the first to discover the priming effect phenomenon in 1926 through his studies of green manure decomposition and its effects on legume plants in soil. He noticed that when adding fresh organic residues to the soil, it resulted in intensified mineralization by the humus N. It was not until 1953, though, that the term priming effect was given by Bingeman in his paper titled, The effect of the addition of organic materials on the decomposition of an organic soil. Several other terms had been used before priming effect was coined, including priming action, added nitrogen interaction (ANI), extra N and additional N. Despite these early contributions, the concept of the priming effect was widely disregarded until about the 1980s-1990s. The priming effect has been found in many different studies and is regarded as a common occurrence, appearing in most plant soil systems. However, the mechanisms which lead to the priming effect are more complex then originally thought, and still remain generally misunderstood. Although there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the reason for the priming effect, a few undisputed facts have emerged from the collection of recent research: # The priming effect can arise either instantaneously or very shortly (potentially days or weeks) after the addition of a substance is made to the soil. # The priming effect is larger in soils that are rich in C and N as compared to those poor in these nutrients. # Real priming effects have not been observed in sterile environments. # The size of the priming effect increases as the amount of added treatment to the soil increases. Recent findings suggest that the same priming effect mechanisms acting in soil systems may also be present in aquatic environments, which suggests a need for broader considerations of this phenomenon in the future. Decomposition One suitable definition of organic matter is biological material in the process of decaying or decomposing, such as humus. A closer look at the biological material in the process of decaying reveals so-called organic compounds (biological molecules) in the process of breaking up (disintegrating). The main processes by which soil molecules disintegrates are by bacterial or fungal enzymatic catalysis. If bacteria or fungi were not present on Earth, the process of decomposition would have proceeded much slower. Organic chemistry Measurements of organic matter generally measure only organic compounds or carbon, and so are only an approximation of the level of once-living or decomposed matter. Some definitions of organic matter likewise only consider \\"organic matter\\" to refer to only the carbon content, or organic compounds, and do not consider the origins or decomposition of the matter. In this sense, not all organic compounds are created by living organisms, and living organisms do not only leave behind organic material. A clam's shell, for example, while biotic, does not contain much organic carbon, so may not be considered organic matter in this sense. Conversely, urea is one of many organic compounds that can be synthesized without any biological activity. Organic matter is heterogeneous and very complex. Generally, organic matter, in terms of weight, is: * 45‚Äì55% carbon * 35‚Äì45% oxygen * 3‚Äì5% hydrogen * 1‚Äì4% nitrogen The molecular weights of these compounds can vary drastically, depending on if they repolymerize or not, from 200 to 20,000 amu. Up to one third of the carbon present is in aromatic compounds in which the carbon atoms form usually six-membered rings. These rings are very stable due to resonance stabilization, so they are difficult to break down. The aromatic rings are also susceptible to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack from other electron-donating or electron-accepting material, which explains the possible polymerization to create larger molecules of organic matter. There are also reactions that occur with organic matter and other material in the soil to create compounds never seen before. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to characterize these because so little is known about natural organic matter in the first place. Research is currently being done to figure out more about these new compounds and how many of them are being formed.\\"Topic Snapshot: Natural Organic Material\\", American Water Works Association Research Foundation, 2007, 22 April 2007 Aquatic Aquatic organic matter can be further divided into two components: (1) dissolved organic matter (DOM), measured as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and (2) particulate organic matter (POM). They are typically differentiated by that which can pass through a 0.45 micrometre filter (DOM), and that which cannot (POM). =Detection= Organic matter plays an important role in drinking water and wastewater treatment and recycling, natural aquatic ecosystems, aquaculture, and environmental rehabilitation. It is therefore important to have reliable methods of detection and characterisation, for both short- and long-term monitoring. A variety of analytical detection methods for organic matter have existed for up to decades, to describe and characterise organic matter. These include, but are not limited to: total and dissolved organic carbon, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations. =Water purification= The same capability of natural organic matter that helps with water retention in soil creates problems for current water purification methods. In water, organic matter can still bind to metal ions and minerals. These bound molecules are not necessarily stopped by the purification process, but do not cause harm to any humans, animals, or plants. However, because of the high level of reactivity of organic matter, by- products that do not contain nutrients can be made. These by-products can induce biofouling, which essentially clogs water filtration systems in water purification facilities, as the by-products are larger than membrane pore sizes. This clogging problem can be treated by chlorine disinfection (chlorination), which can break down residual material that clogs systems. However, chlorination can form disinfection by-products. Water with organic matter can be disinfected with ozone-initiated radical reactions. The ozone (three oxygens) has very strong oxidation characteristics. It can form hydroxyl radicals (OH) when it decomposes, which will react with the organic matter to shut down the problem of biofouling.Cho, Min, Hyenmi Chung, and Jeyong Yoon, \\"Disinfection of Water Containing Natural Organic Matter by Using Ozone-Initiated Radical Reactions,\\" Abstract, Applied and Environmental Microbiology Vol. 69 No.4 (2003): 2284-2291. Vitalism The equation of \\"organic\\" with living organisms comes from the now-abandoned idea of vitalism that attributed a special force to life that alone could create organic substances. This idea was first questioned after the artificial synthesis of urea by Friedrich W√∂hler in 1828.

The battle was a turning point in the American reconquest of South Carolina from the British. Morgan's forces conducted a double envelopment of Tarleton's forces, the only double envelopment of the war. Tarleton's force of 1000 British troops were set against 2000 troops under Morgan. Morgan's forces suffered casualties of only 25 killed and 124 wounded. Tarleton's force was almost completely eliminated with almost 30% casualties and 55% of his force captured or missing, with Tarleton himself and only about 200 British troops escaping. A small force of the Continental Army under the command of Morgan had marched to the west of the Catawba River, in order to forage for supplies and raise the morale of local Colonial sympathizers. The British had received incorrect reports that Morgan's army was planning to attack the important strategic fort of Ninety Six, held by American Loyalists to the British Crown and located in the west of the Carolinas. The British considered Morgan's army a threat to their left flank. General Charles Cornwallis dispatched cavalry (dragoons) commander Tarleton to defeat Morgan's command. Upon learning Morgan's army was not at Ninety Six, Tarleton, bolstered by British reinforcements, set off in hot pursuit of the American detachment. Morgan resolved to make a stand near the Broad River. He selected a position on two low hills in open woodland, with the expectation that the aggressive Tarleton would make a headlong assault without pausing to devise a more intricate plan. He deployed his army in three main lines. Tarleton's army, after exhaustive marching, reached the field malnourished and heavily fatigued. Tarleton attacked immediately; however, the American defense-in-depth absorbed the impact of the British attack. The British lines lost their cohesion as they hurried after the retreating Americans. When Morgan's army went on the offensive, it wholly overwhelmed Tarleton's force. Tarleton's brigade was wiped out as an effective fighting force, and, coupled with the British defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain in the northwest corner of South Carolina, this action compelled Cornwallis to pursue the main southern American army into North Carolina, leading to the Battle of Guilford Court House, and Cornwallis's eventual defeat at the Siege of Yorktown in Virginia in October 1781. In the opinion of John Marshall, \\"Seldom has a battle, in which greater numbers were not engaged, been so important in its consequences as that of Cowpens.\\" Background On October 14, 1780, Continental Army commander General George Washington chose Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island Quaker officer, to be commander of the Southern Department of the rebel Continental forces.Buchanan, 275 Greene's task was not an easy one. In 1780 the Carolinas had been the scene of a long string of disasters for the Continental Army, the worst being the capture of one American army under Gen. Benjamin Lincoln in May 1780, at the Siege of Charleston. The British took control of this city, the largest in the South and the capital of South Carolina, and occupied it. Later that year another Colonial army, commanded by Gen. Horatio Gates, was destroyed at the Battle of Camden. A victory of Colonial militia over their Loyalist counterparts at the Battle of Kings Mountain on the northwest frontier in October had bought time, but most of South Carolina was still occupied by the British. When Greene took command, the southern army numbered 2307 men (on paper, 1482 present), of whom only 949 were Continental regulars, mostly the famous highly trained \\"Maryland Line\\" regiment. Brig. Gen. Daniel Morgan On December 3, Brigadier General Daniel Morgan reported for duty to Greene's headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina.Buchanan, 276 At the start of the Revolution, Morgan, whose military experience dated to the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763), had served at the Siege of Boston in 1775.Buchanan, 280 Later he participated in the 1775 invasion of Canada and its climactic battle, the Battle of Quebec. That battle, on December 31, 1775, ended in defeat and Morgan's capture by the British.Buchanan, pp. 280‚Äì4 Morgan was exchanged in January 1777 and placed by George Washington in command of a picked force of 500 trained riflemen, known as Morgan's Riflemen. Morgan and his men played a key role in the 1777 victory at Saratoga along the Hudson River in upstate New York, which proved to be a turning point of the entire war.Buchanan, 285 Bitter after being passed over for promotion and plagued by severe attacks of sciatica, Morgan left the rebel army in 1779. A year later he was promoted to brigadier general and returned to service in the Southern Department.Buchanan 287-8 Greene decided that his weak army was unable to meet the British in a stand-up fight. He made the unconventional decision to divide his army, sending a detachment west of the Catawba River to raise the morale of the locals and find supplies beyond the limited amounts available around Charlotte.Buchanan, 292 Greene gave Morgan command of this wing and instructed him to join with the militia west of the Catawba and take command of them.Buchanan, 293 Morgan headed west on December 21, charged with taking position between the Broad and Pacolet rivers, and protecting the civilians in that area. He had 600 men, some 400 of which were Continentals, mostly the Marylanders. The rest were Virginia militia who had experience as Continentals.Buchanan, 296 By Christmas Day Morgan had reached the Pacolet River. He was joined by 60 more South Carolina militia led by the experienced guerrilla partisan Andrew Pickens.Buchanan 298-9 Other militia from Georgia and the Carolinas joined Morgan's camp.Buchanan, 301-2 Meanwhile, Lord Cornwallis was planning to return to North Carolina and conduct the invasion that he had postponed after the defeat at Kings Mountain.Buchanan, 306-7 Morgan's force represented a threat to his left. Additionally, Cornwallis received incorrect intelligence claiming that Morgan was going to attack the important British fort of American Loyalists at Ninety Six, in western South Carolina. Seeking to save the fort and defeat Morgan's command, Cornwallis on January 2 ordered cavalry (dragoons) Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton to the west. \\"Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton\\" by Sir Joshua Reynolds Tarleton was 26 years old and had enjoyed a spectacular career in his service with the British in the colonies. In December 1776, he and a small party surprised and captured Colonial Gen. Charles Lee in New Jersey. He served with distinction at the Siege of Charleston and the Battle of Camden. Commanding the British Legion, a mixed infantry/cavalry force composed of American Loyalists who constituted some of the best British troops in the Carolinas, Tarleton won victories at Monck's Corner and Fishing Creek. He became infamous among Colonists after his victory at the Battle of Waxhaws, because his men had killed American soldiers after they had surrendered. In Tarleton's account published in the British Isles in 1781, he said that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge and his men, thinking him dead, engaged in \\"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\\".A History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781, Banastre Tarleton, Dublin, 1787 (reprint 1781), p 32. Tarleton and the Legion marched to Ninety Six. After learning Morgan was not there, Tarleton decided to increase his forces. He asked for reinforcements of British regulars, which Cornwallis sent. Tarleton set out with his enlarged command to drive Morgan across the Broad River.Buchanan, 309 On January 12 he received accurate news of Morgan's location and continued with hard marching, building boats to cross rivers that were flooding with winter rains.Buchanan, 311 Receiving word that Tarleton was in hot pursuit, Morgan retreated north, to avoid being trapped between Tarleton and Cornwallis.Buchanan, 312 By the afternoon of the 16th, Morgan was approaching the Broad River, which was high with flood waters and reported difficult to cross. He knew Tarleton was close behind. By nightfall he had reached a place called locally \\"Hannah's Cowpens\\", a well-known grazing area for local cattle.\\"Battle of Cowpens\\", South Carolina Encyclopedia Pickens, who had been patrolling, arrived that night to join Morgan with his large body of irregular militia. Morgan decided to stand and fight rather than continue to retreat and risk being caught by Tarleton while fording the Broad River. Learning of Morgan's location, Tarleton pushed his troops, marching at 3 a.m. instead of camping for the night.Buchanan, 314-5 Prelude =Continental force= The size of the American force at Cowpens remains in dispute. Morgan claimed in his official report to have had about 800 men at Cowpens, which is substantially supported by historian John Buchanan, whose estimate is between 800 and 1000 men.Buchanan, 319 In contrast, historian Lawrence E. Babits, in his detailed study of the battle, estimates that the strength of Morgan's command on the day of the battle was closer to 1,900, composed of: *A battalion of Continental infantry under Lt. Col. John Eager Howard of Baltimore, with one company from Delaware (\\"Delaware Line\\"), one from Virginia, and three from the famous stalwart \\"Maryland Line\\" regiment, each with a strength of sixty men (300)Babits, 27‚Äì29. *A company of Virginia state militia troops under Captain John LawsonBabits, 28. (75)Babits, 77. *A company of South Carolina state troops under Captain Joseph Pickens (60)Babits, 73. *A small company of North Carolina state troops under Captain Henry Connelly (number not given) *A Virginia militia battalion under Frank TriplettBabits, 33. (160)Babits, 104. *Three companies of Virginia militia under Major David Campbell (50)Babits, 34. *A battalion of North Carolina militia under Colonel Joseph McDowell (260‚Äì285)Babits, 35‚Äì36. *A brigade of four battalions of South Carolina militia under Colonel Andrew Pickens, comprising a three-company battalion of the Spartan Regiment under Lt. Col. Benjamin Roebuck, a four- company battalion of the Spartan Regiment under Col. John Thomas, five companies of the Little River Regiment under Lt. Col. Joseph Hayes, and seven companies of the Fair Forest Regiment under Col. Thomas Brandon. Babits statesBabits, 36. that this battalion \\"ranged in size from 120 to more than 250 men\\". If Roebuck's three companies numbered 120 and Brandon's seven companies numbered 250, then Thomas's four companies probably numbered about 160 and Hayes's five companies about 200, for a total of 730. *Three small companies of Georgia militia commanded by Major CunninghamBabits, 40. who numbered 55Babits, 187, Note 14. *A detachment of the 1st and 3rd Continental Light Dragoons under Lt. Col. William Washington (82), who was a second cousin of Gen. George Washington.Babits, 40‚Äì41. *Detachments of state dragoons from North Carolina and Virginia (30)Babits, 175, Note 101. *A detachment of South Carolina state dragoons, with a few mounted Georgians, commanded by Major James McCall (25)Babits, 41‚Äì42 and 175, Note 101. *A company of newly raised volunteers from the local South Carolina militia commanded by Major Benjamin Jolly (45)Babits, 41‚Äì42. Babits's figures can be summarized as follows: 82 Continental light dragoons, 55 state dragoons, 45 militia dragoons, 300 Continental infantry, about 150 state infantry, and 1,255‚Äì1,280 militia infantry, for a total of 1,887‚Äì1,912 officers and men. Broken down by state, there were about 855 South Carolinians, 442 Virginians, 290‚Äì315 North Carolinians, 180 Marylanders, 60 Georgians, and 60 Delawareans. Morgan's forces were strengthened by these core elements of relatively seasoned troops and his own brilliance in leadership. His Continentals were veterans (Marylanders from the 1776 Battle of Brooklyn), and many of his militia, which included some Overmountain Men, who had fought at the Battle of Musgrove Mill and the Battle of Kings Mountain. The experienced British forces (and particularly their relatively young commander) were accustomed, especially in the Southern Theater, to easily routing often \\"green\\" militia, and could have underestimated the opposition. =British force= Tarleton's force included: *The British Legion: 250 cavalry and 200 infantry,Babits, 46, \\"British Legion Infantry strength at Cowpens was between 200 and 271 enlisted men\\". However, this statement is referenced to a note on 175‚Äì176, which says, \\"The British Legion infantry at Cowpens is usually considered to have had about 200‚Äì250 men, but returns for the 25 December 1780 muster show only 175. Totals obtained by Cornwallis, dated 15 January, show that the whole legion had 451 men, but approximately 250 were dragoons\\". *A troop of the 17th Light Dragoons (50), *A battery of the Royal Artillery (24) with two 3-pounder cannonsBearss, Edwin C., Battle of Cowpens, Originally published by Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, October 15, 1967, .

Broken down by troop classification, there were 300 cavalry, 553 regulars, 24 artillerymen, and 281 militia. Tarleton's men from the Royal Artillery, 17th Light Dragoons, 7th Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), 16th Regiment, and 71st Regiment were reliable and good soldiers: . Tarleton's own unit, the British Legion were formidable \\"in a pursuit situation\\"Babits, 46. but had an uncertain reputation \\"when faced with determined opposition\\". =Morgan's plan= Reenactors at Cowpens Battlefield Daniel Morgan turned to his advantage the landscape of Cowpens, the varying reliability of his troops, his opponent's expectations, and the time available before Tarleton's arrival. He knew untrained militiamen, which composed a large portion of his force, were generally unreliable in battle, and in the past had routed at the first hint of defeat and abandoned the regulars.Buchanan, 328 (The Battle of Camden had ended in disaster when the militia, which was half of the American force, broke and ran as soon as the shooting started.) To eliminate that possibility, he defied convention by placing his army between the Broad and Pacolet rivers, thus making escape impossible if the army was routed. Selecting a low hill as the center of his position, he placed his Continental infantry on it,Buchanan, 317 deliberately leaving his flanks exposed to his opponent. With a ravine on their right flank and a creek on their left flank, Morgan reasoned his forces were protected against British flanking maneuvers at the beginning of the battle. Battle of Cowpens Reenactment, 225th anniversary, January 14, 2006 Morgan reasoned that Tarleton would be highly confident and attack him head on. He arranged his troops to encourage this. He set up three lines of soldiers: one of skirmishers (sharpshooters), one of militia, and a main one. The first was 150 select skirmishers from North Carolina (Major McDowell) and Georgia (Major Cunningham). The second line, behind the skirmishers but in front of the third line of Continentals, consisted of 300 militiamen under the command of Col. Andrew Pickens. The effect was the conspicuous placement of weak militia in the center front, to encourage the British to attack there. The skirmishers and militia would screen the strongest Continental troops, while inflicting damage as the British advanced. Morgan asked the militia to fire two volleys, something they could achieve, and then withdraw to the left, to re-form in the rear, behind the third line, under cover of the reserve light dragoons (mounted infantry) commanded by William Washington and James McCall. The irregular militia commander, Colonel Pickens, would execute, in effect, a feigned rout to further embolden the British. The third line, on the hill, was manned by Morgan's best troops: about 550 men consisting of Continentals from the steadfast Brooklyn veterans, the \\"Delaware Line\\" and \\"Maryland Line\\", and experienced militiamen from Georgia and Virginia. Colonel John Eager Howard of Baltimore commanded the Continentals and Colonels Tate and Triplett commanded the experienced militia. The third line could be expected to stand and hold against the British force. Morgan expected that the British advancing uphill would be disorganized, and weakened both physically and psychologically by the first two lines, before engaging the third. The third line would also withdraw a short distance to add to the appearance of rout. In developing his tactics at Cowpens, as historian John Buchanan wrote, Morgan may have been \\"the only general in the American Revolution, on either side, to produce a significant original tactical thought\\".Buchanan, 316 =Tarleton's approach= Battle of Cowpens Reenactment, 225th anniversary, January 14, 2006 At 2:00 a.m. on January 17, 1781, Tarleton roused his troops and continued his march to Cowpens. Lawrence Babits states that, \\"in the five days before Cowpens, the British were subjected to stress that could only be alleviated by rest and proper diet\\". He points out that \\"in the forty-eight hours before the battle, the British ran out of food and had less than four hours‚Äô sleep\\".Babits, 156. Over the whole period, Tarleton's brigade did a great deal of rapid marching across difficult terrain. Babits concludes that they reached the battlefield exhausted and malnourished. Tarleton sensed victory and nothing would persuade him to delay. His Tory scouts had told him of the countryside Morgan was fighting on, and he was certain of success because Morgan's soldiers, mostly militiamen, seemed to be caught between mostly experienced British troops and a flooding river.Buchanan, 320 As soon as he reached the spot, Tarleton formed a battle line, which consisted of dragoons on his flanks, with his two grasshopper cannons in between the British Regulars and American Loyalists. Tarleton's plan was simple and direct. Most of his infantry (including that of the Legion) would be assembled in linear formation and move directly upon Morgan. The right and left flanks of this line would be protected by dragoon units. In reserve were the 250-man battalion of Scottish Highlanders (71st Regiment of Foot), commanded by Major Arthur MacArthur, a professional soldier of long experience who had served in the Dutch Scotch Brigade. Finally, Tarleton kept the 200-man cavalry contingent of his Legion ready to be unleashed when the Americans broke and ran. Battle British attack at Cowpens, the first phase of the Battle of Cowpens American counterattack, the second phase of the Battle of Cowpens Battle of Cowpens January 17, 1781. Right flank (cavalry) of Lt. Col. William Washington and (left flank) of the militia returned to enfilade Morgan's strategy worked perfectly. The British advanced in open order, anticipating victory only to encounter another, stronger line after exerting themselves and suffering casualties. The depth of the American lines gradually soaked up the shock of the British advance. A few minutes before sunrise, Tarleton's vanguard emerged from the woods in front of the American position. Tarleton ordered his dragoons to attack the first line of skirmishers, who opened fire and shot fifteen dragoons. When the dragoons promptly retreated, Tarleton immediately ordered an infantry charge, without pausing to study the American deployment or to allow the rest of his infantry and his cavalry reserve to make it out of the woods. Tarleton attacked the skirmish line without pausing, deploying his main body and his two grasshopper cannons. The American skirmishers kept firing as they withdrew to join the second line manned by Pickens's irregular militia. The British attacked again, this time reaching the militiamen, who (as ordered) poured two volleys into the enemy, especially targeting commanders. The British‚Äîwith 40% of their casualties being officers‚Äîwere astonished and confused. They reorganized and continued to advance. Tarleton ordered one of his officers, Ogilvie, to charge with some dragoons into the \\"defeated\\" Americans. His men moved forward in regular formation and were momentarily paused by the militia musket fire but continued to advance. Pickens's militia seemed to \\"flee\\" as usual, around the American left to the rear as planned after getting off their second volley.Buchanan, 320-22 Taking the withdrawal of the first two lines as a full blown retreat, the British advanced headlong into the third and final line of disciplined Maryland and Delaware regulars which awaited them on the hill. The 71st Highlanders were ordered to flank the American right. John Eager Howard spotted the flanking movement and ordered the Virginia militiamen manning the American right to turn and face the Scots. However, in the noise of battle, Howard's order was misunderstood and the militiamen began to withdraw. It was now 7:45 am and the British had been fighting for nearly an hour. They were tired and disorganized, but they saw the Virginia militia on the rebels‚Äô right withdrawing and believed the Americans were on the run. They charged, breaking formation and advancing in a chaotic mass. Morgan ordered a volley. Howard's \\"fleeing\\" militia suddenly stopped their withdrawal and made an about-face. The Virginians fired into the British at a range of no more than thirty yards, with massive effect, causing the confused British to lurch to a halt. John Eager Howard shouted, \\"Charge bayonets!\\"Buchanan, 324 The Continentals in the center, as ordered, mounted a bayonet charge. Tarleton's force, faced with a terrible surprise, began to collapse; some men surrendering on the spot, while others turned and ran. Howard's men charged forward and seized the two British grasshopper cannons. William Washington's cavalry came around from behind the opposite American left to hit the British on their right flank and rear. Pickens's militia, having now reorganized, charged out from behind the hill, completing a 360-degree circle around the American position to hit the 71st Highlander Scots on the British left flank and rear. Howard ordered the Virginia militia, whose withdrawal had brought on the British ill-fated charge, to turn about and attack the Scots from the other direction. The shock of the sudden charge, coupled with the reappearance of the American militiamen on the left flank where Tarleton's exhausted men expected to see their own cavalry, proved too much for the British. Nearly half of the British and Loyalist infantrymen fell to the ground whether they were wounded or not. Their will to fight was gone. Historian Lawrence Babits diagnoses \\"combat shock\\" as the cause for this abrupt British collapse‚Äîthe effects of exhaustion, hunger, and demoralization suddenly catching up with them.Babits discusses this phenomenon fully on pp. 155‚Äì159 Caught in a clever double envelopment that has been compared with the Battle of Cannae in ancient times,The Army Chaplaincy, Winter 1998 many of the British surrendered. When Tarleton's right flank and center line collapsed, only a minority of the 71st Highlanders were putting up a fight against part of Howard's line. Tarleton, realizing the desperate nature of what was occurring, rode back to his one unit left that was whole, the British Legion cavalry. He ordered them to charge, but they refused and fled the field.Buchanan, 325 The Highlanders, surrounded by militia and Continentals, surrendered. Desperate to save something, Tarleton found about forty cavalrymen and with them tried to save the two cannons his forces had brought, but they had been taken and held and he too retreated from the field. It was now 8:00 a.m. and the Battle of Cowpens had lasted approximately one hour. In his retreat, Tarleton was able to escape capture by forcing a local planter named Adam Goudylock to serve as a guide.Hays, Joel Stanford, \\"Adam Goudylock (ca. 1726‚Äì1796), Planter, of Albemarle County, Virginia, and Union County, South Carolina,\\" The American Genealogist 88, no. 1 & 2 (2016): 49‚Äì56, 107‚Äì117, at 53‚Äì54. Aftermath Reenactors portraying Colonial troops march into battle at Cowpens Battlefield monument Morgan's army took 712 prisoners, which included 200 wounded. Even worse for the British, the forces lost (especially the British Legion and the dragoons) constituted the cream of Cornwallis's army. Additionally, 110 British soldiers were killed in action, and every artilleryman was either killed or incapacitated by wounds.[Wellington in the Peninsula, Jac Weller, Kaye & Ward, 1961, p27, n4] Tarleton suffered an 86 percent casualty rate, and his brigade had been wiped out as a fighting force. John Eager Howard quoted Maj. McArthur of the 71st Highlanders, now a prisoner of the Americans, as saying that \\"he was an officer before Tarleton was born; that the best troops in the service were put under 'that boy' to be sacrificed.\\"Buchanan, 327 An American prisoner later told that when Tarleton reached Cornwallis and reported the disaster, Cornwallis placed his sword tip on the ground and leaned on it until the blade snapped.Buchanan, 332 Historian Lawrence E. Babits has demonstrated that Morgan's official report of 73 casualties appears to have only included his Continental troops. From surviving records, he has been able to identify by name 128 Colonial soldiers who were either killed or wounded at Cowpens. He also presents an entry in the North Carolina State Records that shows 68 Continental and 80 Militia casualties. It would appear that both the number of Morgan's casualties and the total strength of his force were about double what he officially reported.Babits, 150‚Äì152. Tarleton's apparent recklessness in pushing his command so hard in pursuit of Morgan that they reached the battlefield in desperate need of rest and food may be explained by the fact that, up until Cowpens, every battle that he and his British Legion had fought in the South had been a relatively easy victory. He appears to have been so concerned with pursuing Morgan that he quite forgot that it was necessary for his men to be in a fit condition to fight a battle once they caught him, though Cornwallis himself did press Tarleton to take aggressive action.Stevenson, 52 Coming in the wake of the American debacle at Camden, Cowpens was a surprising victory and a turning point that changed the psychology of the entire war‚Äî\\"spiriting up the people\\", not only those of the backcountry Carolinas, but those in all the Southern states. As it was, the Americans were encouraged to fight further, and the Loyalists and British were demoralized. Furthermore, its strategic result‚Äîthe destruction of an important part of the British army in the South‚Äîwas crucial toward ending the war. Along with the British defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain, Cowpens was a serious blow to Cornwallis, who might have defeated much of the remaining resistance in South Carolina had Tarleton won at Cowpens. Instead, the battle set in motion a series of events leading to the end of the war. Cornwallis abandoned his pacification efforts in South Carolina, stripped his army of its excess baggage, and pursued Greene's force into North Carolina. Skirmishes occurred at the Catawba River (February 1, 1781) and other fords. Yet, after a long chase Cornwallis met Greene at the Battle of Guilford Court House, winning a pyrrhic victory that so damaged his army that he withdrew to Yorktown, Virginia, to rest and refit. Washington seized this opportunity to trap and defeat Cornwallis at the Battle of Yorktown, which caused the British to give up their efforts to defeat the Americans. The 13-striped, 13-starred American flag, with a single star in the center of a circling constellation, once believed to be flown during the battle, became known as the Cowpens flag. In the opinion of John Marshall, \\"Seldom has a battle, in which greater numbers were not engaged, been so important in its consequences as that of Cowpens.\\"Marshall, Volume I, 404. It gave General Nathanael Greene his chance to conduct a campaign of \\"dazzling shiftiness\\" that led Cornwallis by \\"an unbroken chain of consequences to the catastrophe at Yorktown which finally separated America from the British crown\\".Trevelyan, Volume II, 141.

When the private aircraft carrying Maxwell and Kenboya to Zambezi was struck by a lightning and crashed at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the two injured men took refuge in the cavern home of a mutant red ape. While drinking rainwater that had been filtered through the cavern's mineral laden walls, Maxwell suddenly found he was growing larger, stronger and more ferocious, and was able to subdue the attacking red ape with ease. Acknowledging Maxwell as its master, the red ape retrieved an ancient helmet from the depths of the cave and placed it on Maxwell's head. Through the helmet, Maxwell was able to read the ape's mind and discovered its name was Djuba. He also discovered that the helmet enabled him to control the actions of all other animals. Agreeing that these new powers must be used for the good of all Africa, Maxwell created the identity of \\"B'wana Beast\\", and became the Dark Continent's super troubleshooter. =Animal Man= In the initial story arc of Animal Man, written by Grant Morrison, B'wana Beast journeys to America to rescue Djuba, who has been captured by scientists and infected with an experimental form of anthrax.

It can be distinguished from other pinyon species by its thin-walled seeds, which made it especially attractive as a food to Indians and Mexicans living where it grew. Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca noted that the papershell pinon was an important food for the Indians in 1536. Description Pinus remota is a small tree or large shrub, reaching 3‚Äì10 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 40 cm. The bark is thick, rough, and scaly. The leaves ('needles') are in mixed pairs and threes (mostly pairs), slender, 3‚Äì5 cm long, and dull gray-green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces. The cones are squat globose, 3‚Äì5 cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18‚Äì20 months old, with only a small number of thin scales, with typically 5-12 fertile scales. The cones open to 4‚Äì6 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds measure 10‚Äì12 mm long, with a very thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial 1‚Äì2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Woodhouse's scrub jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and able to grow into new trees. Taxonomy Texas pinyon was previously included in Mexican pinyon, only being discovered as distinct in 1966 when US botanist Elbert L. Little noticed that the seed shells of some pinyons in Texas were very thin compared to many others. He treated it as a variety of Mexican pinyon, Pinus cembroides var. remota. Subsequent research found other differences, and it is now usually treated as a distinct species, probably more closely related to the Colorado pinyon P. edulis, which shares thin seed shells and needles mostly in pairs. Texas pinyon differs from both Mexican and Colorado pinyons in the very small, recessed umbo on the cone scales (larger and knob-like on other pinyons). Distribution and habitat The range is in western Texas, United States, on the south edge of the Edwards Plateau and the hills between Fort Stockton and Presidio, and in northeastern Mexico, mainly in Coahuila but also just into Chihuahua and Nuevo Le√≥n. It occurs at low to moderate altitudes, from 450‚Äì700 m on the Edwards Plateau and from 1200‚Äì1800 m in the rest of its range. It is scarce, with small, scattered populations usually on dry, rocky sites and arroyos where bare rock lowers the likelihood of wildfire spreading easily.  Uses  The edible seeds are occasionally collected like those of other pinyons, and sold as pine nuts. However, in its barren, dry habitat, infrequent and small crops are normal, reducing its economic value. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, where its remarkable tolerance of drought and even semi-desert conditions makes it valuable in hot, dry areas. The papershell pi√±on and Cabeza de Vaca Pinus remota has importance in determining the route of Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca, the first European to explore Texas and the northern part of Mexico. Writing an account of his experiences, Cabeza de Vaca said that in 1535 the Indians of the region through which he was passing gave him and his companions pine nuts to eat which were \\"better than those of Castile [Spain], because they have very thin shells.\\"Olson, Donald W. et al. (Oct 1997), \\"Pi√±on Pines and the Route of Cabeza de Vaca\\", Southwestern Historical Quarterly, October 1997, p 177 Route of Cabeza de Vaca, 1528-1536, as proposed by Alex D. Krieger. In attempting to determine the route followed by Cabeza de Vaca from near the area of Galveston, Texas on the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean coast of Mexico, several scholars, notably Cleve Hallenbeck in 1940, believed that the statement by Cabeza de Vaca referred to the seeds of Pinus edulis, the Colorado pi√±on, which is found in the mountains of southern New Mexico and adjacent Texas‚Äîbut not in northeastern Mexico. The Mexican pi√±on (Pinus cembroides) found in Mexico has thick shells, rather than the thin shells described by Cabeza de Vaca. Therefore, Hallenbeck concluded on the basis of the range of pi√±on species that Cabeza de Vaca had traversed Texas westward from near Galveston to southernmost New Mexico and crossed the Rio Grande river near El Paso, Texas. To the contrary, Alex D. Krieger in a doctoral dissertation (1961) proposed instead that Cabeza De Vaca had traversed the coast of Texas, crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico and turned northwest, passing near present-day Monclova, Mexico and proceeding through Mexico to meet the Rio Grande again near present-day Presidio, Texas.Chipman, Donald E. \\"In Search of Cabeza de Vaca's Route across Texas: An Historiographical Survey\\". (Oct 1987) Southwestern Historical Quarterly, http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colonial/cabezadevaca.pdf, accessed 28 July 2016 Krieger's trans-Mexican route for Cabeza de Vaca was dismissed by proponents of a trans-Texas route because no pi√±on with thin shelled seeds was known to be native to northern Mexico.Olson, et al., pp 178-180 However, in 1966, botanist Elbert L. Little first described a subspecies of the Mexican pi√±on with \\"thin shelled seeds\\" and in 1979 the thin-shelled pi√±on was proposed to be considered as a separate species with the name Pinus remota or papershell pi√±on. In 1996, scholars traveled to the Monclova, Mexico area and collected specimens of the papershell pi√±on, thus proving that Cabeza de Vaca might have encountered thin-shelled pi√±on seeds in Mexico as well as in Texas. The trans-Mexico route of Cabeza de Vaca, proposed by Krieger, now has the support of many scholars.Dolan et al., pp. 184-186 References External links *Photo of cones (scroll half-way down) remota Category:Trees of the South-Central United States Category:Trees of Coahuila Category:Trees of Chihuahua (state) Category:Trees of Nuevo Le√≥n Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States Category:Least concern plants ","title":"Pinus remota"},{"id":"1246742","text":"Sydney 2000 is the official video game of the XXVII Olympic Summer Games, hosted by Sydney, Australia in 2000.

While some of the events are the women's, each event is only set to one gender: it isn't possible to run the women's 100 m hurdles or the men's high jump. Individually, there isn't much difference in gameplay from previous games: two action buttons control speed and there's a third for extra action: jumping, passing a hurdle, setting the angle and releasing the hammer or javelin, touching the wall, etc. All events rely on this formula, except, Skeet and K1 Slalom, and diving (which uses \\"click-a-long\\" rather than the freeform jumping of Olympic Gold) Chase Cycling also requires the player to pace himself, or the final cyclist will run out of long pace before the final sprint. The biggest difference from previous games in the series lies in the Olympic mode: instead of starting in the Olympics, the player must improve and qualify an athlete for the event. Each event has four stages (Open Trials, Invitation Event, The Championship, and Olympic Class), and for each stage the player must complete minigames in the Cyber Gym that range from running on a treadmill, climbing a pole, squats or reaction training, for a total of 20 minigames. Completing a Cyber Gym game improves the athlete in one of the three ratings temporarily, and to earn the new capacities definitively, the athlete must complete an event with a certain score. After the player is happy with the athlete development, he can try to qualify for the next stage by running against other athletes at the same level. Although it's possible to compete in the Olympics as soon as the athlete reaches the Olympic Class, to get a perfect athlete (with 100% on all ratings) one must complete all minigames, including those on Olympic Class. As the game relies mostly on athletes' ratings, even players with lower button presses per minute can make World Record times without serious effort as long as they passed all the mini games. Other modes include an arcade mode, training and head to head, where two players can compete with their Olympic mode trained athletes. There are four difficulty levels. Although generally stable, the game lacks tweaking in some events: the High jump uses men's results, and while some events such as the 100 m sprint and triple jump are quite easy, others such as the javelin and hammer throw require much training. Reception Sydney 2000 received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the Dreamcast and PlayStation versions were ported for release and published by Capcom on 26 October 2000, Famitsu gave the latter console version a score of 26 out of 40. GameZone gave the PC version a score of nine out of ten and said, \\"The graphical quality of this program makes it a sure-fire winner. What it lacks in some areas, it makes up for in others. If you are a fan of Olympic-style action, this is a must-have.\\" However, Computer Games Magazine gave it one- and-a-half stars out of five and said that it was \\"a prime example of a game that should have stayed where it belonged--on the consoles,\\" and that the game \\"simply isn't much fun; most of the time, it isn't any fun at all. It feels more like work than a good time and that's never a good recipe for success.\\" Kevin Rice reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"A weekend rental at best.

It is about Giacomo Rappaccini, a medical researcher in Padua who grows a garden of poisonous plants. He brings up his daughter to tend the plants, and she becomes resistant to the poisons, but in the process she herself becomes poisonous to others. The traditional story of a poisonous maiden has been traced back to India, and Hawthorne's version has been adopted in contemporary works. Plot summary The story is set in Padua, Italy, in a distant and unspecified past. From his quarters, Giovanni Guasconti, a young student of letters at the University of Padua, looks at Beatrice, the beautiful daughter of Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, a scientist who works in isolation. Beatrice is confined to the lush and locked gardens, which are filled with poisonous plants grown by her father. Giovanni notices Beatrice's strangely intimate relationship with the plants as well as the withering of fresh flowers and the death of an insect when exposed to her skin or breath. Having fallen in love, Giovanni enters the garden and meets with Beatrice a number of times, while ignoring his mentor, Professor Pietro Baglioni, who warns him that Rappaccini is devious and that he and his work should be avoided. Giovanni discovers that Beatrice, having been raised in the presence of poison, is poisonous herself. Beatrice urges Giovanni to look past her poisonous exterior and see her pure and innocent essence, creating great feelings of doubt in Giovanni. He begins to suffer the consequences of his encounters with the plants‚Äîand with Beatrice‚Äîwhen he discovers that he himself has become poisonous; after another meeting with Baglioni, Giovanni brings a powerful antidote to Beatrice so that they can be together, but the antidote kills Beatrice rather than cure her of her poisonous nature. Sources According to Octavio Paz, the sources of Hawthorne's story lie in Ancient India. In the play Mudrarakshasa, one of two political rivals employs the gift of a visha kanya, a beautiful girl who is fed on poison. This theme of a woman transformed into a phial of venom is popular in Indian literature and appears in the Puranas. From India, the story passed to the West and contributed to the Gesta Romanorum, among other texts. In the 17th century, Robert Burton picked up the tale in The Anatomy of Melancholy and gave it a historical character: the Indian king Porus sends Alexander the Great a girl brimming with poison. In Hawthorne's story, the character Pietro Baglioni draws a parallel between Beatrice's fate and an old story of a poisonous Indian girl presented to Alexander, a tale that appears to be based on the Burton/Browne story. Also, the University of Padua is famed for its vast botanical garden, which was founded in 1545. But whether the garden actually influenced Hawthorne in writing \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" is not known. It is also possible that Hawthorne was inspired by the character Elizabeth's grotesque revenge in the 1833 novel The Down-Easters by fellow New Englander John Neal. The two authors first connected when Neal's magazine The Yankee published the first substantial praise of Hawthorne's work in 1828. Style Hawthorne begins the story with reference to the writings of the fictional writer 'Monsieur Aub√©pine', named after the French name of the hawthorn plant. He both praises and criticizes the author's style and intent. This introduction aims to establish a tone of uncertainty and confusion, throwing off expectations and establishing the theme of the interrelationship of perception, reality and fantasy. He lists texts by M. de l'Aub√©pine, some of which translate into Hawthorne's own works as follows: * Contes deux fois racont√©s is Twice-Told Tales. * Le Voyage c√©leste √† chemin de fer is The Celestial Railroad. * Le Nouveau P√®re Adam et la Nouvelle M√®re Eve is The New Adam and Eve. * Rod√©ric ou le Serpent √† l'estomac is Egotism; or, The Bosom- Serpent. * Le Culte de feu is Fire Worship. * \\"L'Artiste du beau\\" is \\"The Artist of the Beautiful or the Mechanical Butterfly.\\" The narrator says the text was translated from Beatrice ou la Belle Empoisonneuse which translates to \\"Beatrice or the Beautiful Poisoner\\" and was published in \\"La Revue Anti- Aristocratique\\" (\\"The Anti-Aristocratic Review\\").

It is named after the prominent Polish film producer Lew Rywin, who was a key figure.  Chain of events  On 22 July 2002, Lew Rywin called in at the office of Adam Michnik, editor of Poland's largest daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza. Rywin offered to arrange, in exchange for a bribe of 17.5 million USD, a change in a draft law aimed at limiting the print media's influence on radio and television, which would have been in Michnik's favour ‚Äì as the original draft would have prevented the paper's publishing house, Agora S.A. from taking over the private TV station Polsat or the second channel of Poland's public TV broadcaster TVP. Rywin said he was acting on behalf of what he called a \\"group in power\\" which wanted to remain anonymous but possibly included then prime minister Leszek Miller of the post-communist SLD. Michnik secretly recorded the conversation and started investigations to establish the identity of the \\"group in power\\". He also arranged a meeting between Miller, Rywin, and himself in Miller's office. When Miller denied any involvement in the deal Rywin had put forward, according to the other persons present, Rywin lost his composure and even spoke of committing suicide. Rywin himself later claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol. Only after the Gazeta Wyborcza alleged investigations had remained inconclusive, on 27 December 2002 ‚Äì half a year after the incident, which cast some doubts on the real role of the newspaper in the affair ‚Äì the paper printed the partial record of Michnik's conversation with Rywin, thus starting the actual scandal.\\"Ustawa za ≈Çap√≥wkƒô czyli przychodzi Rywin do Michnika\\" However other papers had reported parts of the story earlier (e.g. weekly magazine Wprost\\"Z ≈ºycia koalicji\\") In January 2003, the Polish parliament (Sejm) created a special committee to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of the affair. A separate penal prosecution resulted in Rywin being sentenced to two years in prison and a 100,000 PLN fine on 26 April for 2004 fraud, as the court concluded that the \\"group in power\\" did not exist and Rywin had been acting on his own initiative. On 10 December 2004, the Warsaw court of appeals repealed this sentence, sentencing Rywin to a reduced term of two years for \\"paid protection\\" on behalf of a still anonymous group. Contradictory conclusions In the meantime, the protracted hearings of the Sejm's special committee continued. On April 5, 2004 the Sejm committee officially finished proceedings. With a majority vote supported by the SLD and Samoobrona deputies to the committee, it adopted without prior discussion a final report which came to the same conclusion as the penal court - according to which Rywin had been acting completely on his own. However, the dissenting minority, including committee chairman Tomasz Na≈Çƒôcz, refused to back the report and began to compile minority reports. The Sejm then had to decide whether to accept the committee's official final report or one of the various minority reports as the outcome of the investigation. On September 24, 2004, the Sejm unexpectedly voted to accept the minority reportInternetowy System Akt√≥w Prawnych. Isap.sejm.gov.pl. Retrieved on 2013-09-07. that most radically departed from the majority report and named the following persons as the masterminds behind Rywin's mission: *prime minister Leszek Miller (stepped down in May 2004) *Aleksandra Jakubowska, deputy minister of culture in Miller's government, who was also in charge of the amendment of the law that would possibly have benefited Agora S.A. *W≈Çodzimierz Czarzasty, another high-ranking SLD media policy-maker *Robert Kwiatkowski, head of the Polish national public TV broadcaster TVP, the second channel of which was discussed to be privatized and a possible target for an Agora S.A. takeover *Lech Nikolski, Miller's Chief of Cabinet, later in charge of the Polish EU membership referendum as minister without portfolio. Long-term impact on political culture The long-term impact of the affair on Poland's political culture has yet to be fully assessed. Certainly, it has once more reinforced the Polish population's already deeply rooted traditional suspicion of the state and politicians. Well-known former dissident Adam Michnik's reputation has been damaged as he was suspected to be more deeply entangled in the scandal, although in what way remains unclear. His friendly relations with members of the former communist political establishment were exposed. This increased the numbers of Poles who are convinced that politicians and opinion-leaders are involved with the large-scale shadow economy. While people were certainly satisfied when high- ranking politicians were supposedly revealed as masterminds, this has also disenchanted even more people away from politics: On the one hand, the supposed delinquents deny all accusations and cannot be held accountable; on the other hand, it was quite obvious that the Sejm's acceptance of the minority report, which claimed the involvement of high-ranking politicians, had itself been due to some clever tactics of the interested opposition factions and a certain inattentiveness of the SLD. This created the impression that the opposition was not really interested in neutrally establishing the truth, either, but rather playing a power game of its own. The one person who seems to have benefited the most from the affair was Jan Rokita, the representative of the largest opposition party Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) at the time and a member of the investigative committee, the hearings of which were broadcast live on TV. With his aggressive style of interrogation he made a name for himself as a tough investigator, thus establishing himself as the opposition's most important figure within a few months and at the time came to be considered as the most likely aspirant to the post of prime minister after a probable SLD election defeat in 2005. Apart from that, the right-wing party Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo≈õƒá), whose defining themes are the fight against crime and corruption, had benefited from the affair, which contributed to raising its public profile. It was the party's deputy Zbigniew Ziobro who had authored the radical minority report the Sejm had passed. By late 2004, however, the Rywin affair had already being overshadowed by another scandal, which could have even more far- reaching effects: The so-called Orlen affair (afera Orlenu, Orlengate) surrounding the privatization of the largely state-owned oil giant PKN Orlen. Against the background of these affairs, right-wing politicians, in particular from the Law and Justice party, began calling for an end to the post-1989 Third Republic, which they consider inherently weak, morally corrupt and controlled by cliques. Law and Justice presidential candidate Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and eventual winner called a \\"moral revolution\\", it should be completely replaced with a Fourth Republic, a \\"strong and moral state\\".Warsaw ‚Äì The Official Website of the Capital of Poland. E-warsaw.pl. Retrieved on 2013-09-07. The fallout from the Rywin affair contributed to the SLD's massive defeat at the 2005 parliamentary election. The SLD has never really recovered, and lost all of its remaining seats in 2015.

First period Jean Giono was born to a family of modest means, his father a cobbler of Piedmontese descent and his mother a laundry woman. He spent the majority of his life in Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Forced by family needs to leave school at the age of sixteen and get a job in a bank, he nevertheless continued to read voraciously, in particular the great classic works of literature including the Bible, Homer's Iliad, the works of Virgil, and the Tragiques of Agrippa d'Aubign√©. He continued to work at the bank until he was called up for military service at the outbreak of World War I, and the horrors he experienced on the front lines turned him into an ardent and lifelong ardent pacifist. In 1919, he returned to the bank, and a year later, married a childhood friend with whom he had two children. Following the success of his first published novel, Colline (1929) (which won him the Prix Brentano earned $1,000, and drew an English translation of the book), he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis. Colline was followed by two more novels heavily influenced by Virgil and Homer, Un de Baumugnes (1929) and Regain (1930), the three together comprising the famous ‚ÄúPan trilogy‚Äù, so- called because in it Giono depicts the natural world as being imbued with the power of the Greek god Pan. The other novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties on the whole continued in the same vein‚Äîset in Provence, with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a pantheistic view of nature. Marcel Pagnol based three of his films on Giono's work of this period: Regain, starting Fernandel and with music by Honegger; Ang√®le, and La Femme du boulanger, with the actor Raimu. Throughout the nineteen-thirties, Giono expressed the pacifism he had adopted as a result of his experiences during World War I in novels such as Le grand troupeau (1931), and pamphlets such as Refus d‚Äôob√©issance (1937), and the Lettre aux paysans sur la pauvret√© et la paix (1938). This in turn resulted in his forming a relationship with a group of like-minded people including Lucien Jacques and Henri Fluch√®re among others, who gathered each year in the hamlet of Contadour, and whose pacifist writings were published as the Cahiers du Contadour.Bibliographie des ouvrages de Jean GIONO (in French) In 1937, he famously asked, \\"What is the worst that can happen if Germany invades France?\\" Transition The end of the nineteen- thirties brought a crisis in Giono's life. As far as his writing was concerned, he had come to feel that it was time to stop ‚Äúdoing Giono‚Äù (faire du Giono), and to take his work in a new direction.Giono. Pierre Citron, 1990 At the same time it was becoming apparent that his work for pacifism was a failure, and that another war was inevitable and fast approaching. The declaration of war on 1 September 1939 came while the Contadoureans were assembled for their annual reunion. The result of Giono's former peace-making efforts was that he was briefly imprisoned as a Nazi sympathiser before the proceedings were dropped without any charges being laid. The subsequent period of renewal saw the self-educated Giono now turn to Stendhal as a literary model in the same way as previously he had been influenced by the Classics. His novels thus began to be set in a specific time and place, confronting the protagonists with specific politics, issues, causes and events, in contrast with the timelessness of his earlier work. He also adopted the Stendhalian narrative technique of letting the reader into the experience of the protagonist by means of the interior monologue, whereas the dominant technique of his earlier novels had been that of the omniscient narrator. He similarly formed the ambition of writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by Balzac‚Äôs Com√©die humaine, in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and compare and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family in times a hundred years apart. This project was never realised, with only the four Hussard novels, (Angelo (1958), Le Hussard sur le Toit (1951), Le Bonheur fou (1957), Mort d‚Äôun personnage (1948)) actually completed according to plan, but it is echoed in Giono's postwar work in the dichotomy between historical novels set in the mid-nineteenth century, and contemporary novels set in the mid-twentieth.Giono, Jean. Oeuvres romanesques compl√®tes. 6 vols. Edition de la Pl√©iade √©tablie par Robert Ricatte. Paris: Gallimard, 1971-1983 Postface √† Angelo. IV 1163-1182 His newfound interest in history even led to his writing an actual history book, Le D√©sastre de Pavie (1963). As he began to focus on the human being rather than the natural world, his understanding of psychology and motivation was also influenced by the writings of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, whose analysis helped him to articulate a much darker view of human nature in his later years, and about whom he wrote the article \\"Monsieur Machiavel, ou le coeur humain d√©voil√©\\" (1951). In 1944, when France was liberated, Giono was again accused of collaboration with the Nazis, and was again imprisoned for five months before he was freed without charges ever being made. This led to his being blacklisted, so that for three years he was barred from publication. It was during this period of ostracism that he began in 1945 to write Angelo, metaphorically the laboratory in which he experimented, tested and attempted to integrate his new approach to his work. It contains not only a first version of the story of Ang√©lo Pardi that took its final form in Le Hussard sur le toit and Le Bonheur fou, but also the nucleus of many other works of his second period, and makes use of new narrative techniques he developed further in other novels. He ultimately set it aside, no doubt considering it too derivative, and moved on to the other projects it gave rise to. Second period The first major novel of his second period to be published was Un roi sans divertissement (published in 1947, and made into a successful film for which Giono himself wrote the screenplay, in 1963). It takes the form of a detective story set in Haute Provence in the early nineteenth century, and reveals Giono's new pessimism about human nature in that the policeman is forced to the realisation that he himself is capable of being as evil as the murderer he is tracking. Stylistically brilliant, it consists of the juxtaposed accounts of events as told by the different people affected, devoid of explanation, from which the reader must piece together the meaning. The most famous novel of his second period is Le Hussard sur le toit, the first part of the definitive version of the story of Ang√©lo Pardi he had sketched in Angelo. It was published in 1951, and made into a film by Jean-Paul Rappeneau starring Juliette Binoche in 1995. Ang√©lo, like Stendhal's Fabrice del Dongo (La Chartreuse de Parme) on whom he is modeled, is a chivalrous romantic whose quest constitutes an inquiry into the nature of happiness, while the cholera epidemic he finds himself confronted with in Provence in 1832 is an allegory for the wars that had so deeply affected Giono. In structure it is a picaresque series of episodes, full of evocative descriptions of the country. Its sequel, Le Bonheur fou (The Straw Man) (1957) follows Ang√©lo in the Italy of the 1848 revolution. Les Ames fortes (1950), filmed by Raoul Ruiz in 2001, is another of the masterpieces of this period. As dark as Un Roi sans divertissement, it examines the depths a person can sink to in greed, grasping self-interest and the exploitation of others. Also as in Un Roi sans divertissement, the story is again told purely in the words of the protagonists, without the intervention of a narrator or comment from the author, thus forcing readers to reach their own conclusions. Les Grands chemins (1951), considerably less dark, deals with the nature of the road, gambling, the lie, and friendship, again in a first-person narration entirely in the voice of the protagonist and devoid of explanation or elucidation from the author. Also worthy of mention is his Voyage en Italie (1953). Neither a travel guide nor a straightforward account of a trip as the name suggests, this is a highly personal account of Giono's experiences and of the people he meets and sees that tells the reader more about Giono than about Italy. Outside France, Giono's best-known work is probably the short story The Man who Planted Trees (and 1987 film version). This optimistic tale of a man who brings a deserted valley back to life by planting trees reflects Giono's long- standing love of the natural world, an attitude that made him a precursor to the modern ecological movement. He thus declined to receive any royalties from this text, and granted free use to anyone who wanted to distribute or translate it. In his later years, Giono was honoured with the Prince Rainier of Monaco literary prize in 1953, awarded for his lifetime achievements, was elected to the Acad√©mie Goncourt in 1954, and became a member of the Conseil Litt√©raire of Monaco in 1963. Giono died of a heart attack in 1970. Works References Further reading * \\"Jean Giono: From Pacifism to Collaboration\\". TELOS 139 (Summer 2007). New York: Telos Press * Giono.

Raleigh supported Fort Hatteras and Fort Clark on August 28‚Äì29, 1861; took part in an expedition on October 1 to capture United States Army steamer Fanny with valuable stores on board; and accompanied CSS Sea Bird when she reconnoitered Pamlico Sound on January 20, 1862. She was also active in defense of Roanoke Island against an amphibious assault by overwhelming Federal forces on February 7‚Äì8, 1862, and at Elizabeth City, North Carolina 2 days later. Thence Raleigh escaped through Dismal Swamp Canal to Norfolk, Virginia. On March 8‚Äì9, 1862, Raleigh was tender to CSS Virginia during the historic Battle of Hampton Roads, for which she received the thanks of the Confederate Congress. With the Federal recapture of Norfolk Navy Yard in May 1862, Raleigh steamed up the James River, but thereafter a shortage of crew members restricted her to flag-of-truce or patrol service.

The story reflects the aspirations and dreams of today's youth, as they battle it out with conventions and norms to carve their own niche in the world. The screenplay and dialogues of the initial episodes were penned by Arif Ali and Sanyukta Chaudhuri. Plot The story revolves around a young girl named Pooja who hails from a conservative middle-class Gujarati household in Mumbai. Pooja dreams of becoming a successful film director and idolises Karan Johar. To realise her dream, Pooja secretly joins a coveted film studies course at the trendy St. Martin's College, keeping her father in the dark. At the college, the simple and straightforward Pooja instantly comes face to face with the hip and high-class students of St. Martins's and is made intensely aware of her middle-class looks and attitude. She is ill-treated by the well- to-do English speaking students who label her as 'vernacular' as she speaks in her Gujarati tone and accent. The story revolves around her college life as she gradually wins over her classmates, makes new friends and successfully completes her course. Later, the story shifts to Pooja's life after college as she starts the new chapter in her life as an independent working woman. Her sister, Poornima falls in love with and marries Ronit.

In the early 1970s, Monz√≥ reported from Vietnam, Cambodia, Northern Ireland and East Africa for the Barcelona newspaper Tele/eXpres. He was one of the members of the Catalan literary collective, Of√®lia Dracs. He lives in Barcelona and publishes regularly in La Vanguardia. His fiction is characterized by an awareness of pop culture and irony. His other prose maintains this humor. One collection of his essays, Catorze ciutats comptant-hi Brooklyn, is notable for its account of New York City in the days immediately following September 11. In collaboration with Cuca Canals, he wrote the dialogue for Bigas Luna's Jam√≥n, jam√≥n. He has also written El tango de Don Joan, with J√©r√¥me Savary. In 2007 he wrote and read the opening speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the year in which Catalan culture was the guest. Monz√≥ designed an acclaimed lecture written as if it were a short story, thus differing completely from a traditional speech. From December 2009 to April 2010 there took place in the Arts Santa M√≤nica Gallery in Barcelona a great retrospective exhibition on his life and his work, called Monz√≥.

Background and publication history The collection includes several previously-published short stories, and was named in honor of The Old Manse where Hawthorne and his wife lived for the first three years of their marriage. The first edition was published in 1846. Hawthorne seems to have been paid $75 for the publication. Analysis Many of the tales collected in Mosses from an Old Manse are allegories and, typical of Hawthorne, focus on the negative side of human nature. Hawthorne's friend Herman Melville noted this aspect in his review \\"Hawthorne and His Mosses\\": William Henry Channing noted in his review of the collection, in The Harbinger, its author \\"had been baptized in the deep waters of Tragedy\\", and his work was dark with only brief moments of \\"serene brightness\\" which was never brighter than \\"dusky twilight\\". Critical reception After the book's first publication, Hawthorne sent copies to critics including Margaret Fuller, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry Theodore Tuckerman. Poe responded with a lengthy review in which he praised Hawthorne's writing but faulted him for associating with New England journals, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the Transcendentalists. He wrote, \\"Let him mend his pen, get a bottle of visible ink, come out from the Old Manse, cut Mr. Alcott, hang (if possible) the editor of 'The Dial,' and throw out of the window to the pigs all his odd numbers of the North American Review.\\" A young Walt Whitman wrote that Hawthorne was underpaid, and it was unfair that his book competed with imported European books. He asked, \\"Shall real American genius shiver with neglect while the public runs after this foreign trash?\\" Generally, most contemporary critics praised the collection and considered it better than Hawthorne's earlier collection, Twice-Told Tales. Regarding the second edition, published in 1854, Hawthorne wrote to publisher James Thomas Fields that he no longer understood the messages he was sending in these stories. He shared, \\"I remember that I always had a meaning‚Äîor, at least, thought I had\\", and noted, \\"Upon my honor, I am not quite sure that I entirely comprehend my own meaning in some of these blasted allegories... I am a good deal changed since those times; and to tell you the truth, my past self is not very much to my taste, as I see in this book.\\" Contents * \\"The Old Manse\\" (1846) * \\"The Birth-Mark\\" (1843) * \\"A Select Party\\" (1844) * \\"Young Goodman Brown\\" (1835) * \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" (1844) * \\"Mrs. Bullfrog\\" (1837) * \\"Fire-Worship\\" (1843) * \\"Buds and Bird-Voices\\" (1843) * \\"Monsieur du Miroir\\" (1837) * \\"The Hall of Fantasy\\" (1843) * \\"The Celestial Rail-road \\"(1843) * \\"The Procession of Life\\" (1843) * \\"The New Adam and Eve\\" (1843) * \\"Egotism; or, The Bosom- Serpent\\" (1843) * \\"The Christmas Banquet\\" (1844) * \\"Drowne's Wooden Image\\" (1844) * \\"The Intelligence Office\\" (1844) * \\"Roger Malvin's Burial\\" (1832) * \\"P.'s Correspondence\\" (1845) * \\"Earth's Holocaust\\" (1844) * \\"The Old Apple- Dealer\\" (1843) * \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\" (1844) * \\"A Virtuoso's Collection\\" (1842) =Added to second edition in 1854= * \\"Feathertop\\" (1852) * \\"Passages from a Relinquished Work\\" (1834) * \\"Sketches from Memory\\" (1835) References Further reading * External links Literature Related to the Old Manse, Hawthorne in Salem Category:1846 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Nathaniel Hawthorne ","title":"Mosses from an Old Manse"},{"id":"1246795","text":"Illustration of Hansel and Gretel, a well-known German folktale from the Brothers Grimm, by Arthur Rackham, 1909. German folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Germany over a number of centuries. It shares many characteristics with Scandinavian folklore and English folklore due to their origins in a common Germanic mythology. It reflects a similar mix of influences: a pre-Christian pantheon and other beings equivalent to those of Norse mythology; magical characters (sometimes recognizably pre-Christian) associated with Christian festivals, and various regional 'character' stories. As in Scandinavia, when belief in the old gods disappeared, remnants of the mythos persisted: Holda, a \\"supernatural\\" patron of spinning; the Lorelei, a dangerous Rhine siren derived from 19th century literature; the spirit Berchta (also known as Perchta); the Weisse Frauen, a water spirit said to protect children; the Doppelg√§nger, supernatural beings said to resemble the exactly similar appearance of determined person; the Wild Hunt (in German folklore preceded by an old man, Honest Eckart, who warns others of its approach); the giant R√ºbezahl; changeling legends; and many more generic entities such as the elf, dwarf, kobold and erlking. Popular folklore includes Krampus and Knecht Ruprecht, a rough companion to Santa Claus; the Lutzelfrau, a Yule witch who must be appeased with small presents; the Osterhase (Easter Hare - the original Easter Bunny); and Walpurgisnacht, a spring festival derived from pagan customs. Character folklore includes the stories of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the Godfather Death, the trickster hero Till Eulenspiegel, the Town Musicians of Bremen and Faust. Documentation and preservation of folklore in the states that formally united as Germany in 1871 was initially fostered in the 18th and 19th centuries. As early as 1851, author Bernhard Baader published a collection of folklore research obtained by oral history, called Volkssagen aus dem Lande Baden und den angrenzenden Gegenden. The Saxon author Johann Karl August Mus√§us was another early collector. Study was further promoted by the Prussian poet and philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder. His belief in the role of folklore in ethnic nationalism - a folklore of Germany as a nation rather than of disunited German-speaking peoples - inspired the Brothers Grimm, Goethe and others. For instance, folklore elements, such as the Rhine Maidens and the Grimms' The Story of a Boy Who Went Forth to Learn Fear, formed part of the source material for Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Some of the works of Washington Irving - notably Rip van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - are based on German folktales. Within Germany, the nationalistic aspect was further emphasized during the National Socialist era. Folklore studies, Volkskunde, were co-opted as a political tool, to seek out traditional customs to support the idea of historical continuity with a Germanic culture. Anti-Semitic folklore such as the blood libel legend was also emphasized.

It is a member of the auk family. It nests in old-growth forests or on the ground at higher latitudes where trees cannot grow. Its habit of nesting in trees was suspected but not documented until a tree- climber found a chick in 1974, making it one of the last North American bird species to have its nest described. The marbled murrelet has declined in number since humans began logging its nest trees in the latter half of the 19th century. The decline of the marbled murrelet and its association with old-growth forests, at least in the southern part of its range, have made it a flagship species in the forest preservation movement. In Canada (north of 50¬∞ North Latitude) and Alaska, the declines are not so obvious because populations are much larger and the survey techniques have not had sufficient power to detect changes. Description The marbled murrelet is a small (25 cm), chunky auk with a slender black bill. It has pointed wings and plumage that varies by season. The non-breeding plumage is typically white underneath with a black crown, nape, wings and back. The bird closely resembles its closest relative, the Long-billed murrelet; in fact, these species were considered conspecific up until 1998. In breeding plumage, both have a brown mottled body and face. The Long-billed has a pale white throat, lacking in the Marbled. In winter plumage, the Marbled murrelet has a white neck collar, absent in Long-billed. The Marbled murrelet is shorter-billed and slightly smaller than the Long-billed murrelet. Behavior =Diet and feeding= Marbled murrelet chick (taxidermy) The marbled murrelet feeds at sea both in pelagic offshore areas (often associating with upwellings) and inshore in protected bays and fiords. The bird has not been known to wander from the Pacific coast of North America, all inland and eastern Brachyramphus records being of the closely related long-billed murrelet. Marbled murrelets feed below the water surface on small fish and invertebrates. Some principal foods include sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), Pacific herring (Clupea haringus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), shiner perch, and the invertebrates Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera. Marbled murrelets often forage in pairs but do not feed in large flocks as do other alcids. Loose aggregations of 500 or more birds occasionally occur in winter. Subadults feed singly; but in early July, when pairs of adults are still feeding young, mixed flocks begin to form. Marbled murrelets feed during the day and at night. =Breeding= The nesting behavior of the marbled murrelet is unusual, since unlike most alcids it does not nest in colonies on cliffs or in burrows, but on branches of old-growth and mature conifers such as western hemlock, Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir and coastal redwood, as far as 80 km inland. It lays one egg on a platform of lichen or moss on these branches (less often on the ground). In northern populations, murrelets nest on the ground among rocks, as do other related murrelet species. The egg is incubated for a month, then fed for around 40 days until the chick is able to fledge. Adults fly from ocean feeding areas to inland nest sites, mostly at dusk and dawn. They feed nestlings at least once and sometimes twice per day or night. Usually only one fish is carried to the young. The chick then leaves the nest and flies unaccompanied to the sea. Breeding success is low and chick mortality high. Marbled murrelets do not breed until they are at least two years old. Marbled murrelets nest from mid-April to late September. Peak activity occurs from mid-June to late July in California, and the second week of July to mid-August in Oregon. Marbled murrelets are semicolonial in nesting habits. Two nests found in Washington were located only 150 feet (46 m) apart. Not all mature adults nest every year. Marbled murrelets lay only one egg. Nestlings fledge in 28 days. Young marbled murrelets remain in the nest longer than other alcids and molt into their juvenile plumage before leaving the nest. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the ocean. Habitat and distribution Marbled murrelets occur in summer from Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, Barren islands, and Aleutian Islands south along the coast of North America to Point Sal, Santa Barbara County, in south-central California. Marbled murrelets winter mostly within the same general area, except that they tend to vacate the most northern sections of their range, especially where ice forms on the surface of the fiords. They have been recorded as far south as Imperial Beach of San Diego County, California. =Habitat= Marbled murrelets are coastal birds that occur mainly near saltwater within 1.2 miles (2 km) of shore. However, marbled murrelets have been found up to 59 miles (95 km) inland in Washington, 35 miles (56 km) inland in Oregon, 22 miles (37 km) inland in northern California, and 11 miles (18 km) inland in central California. Over 90% of all marbled murrelet observations in the northern Washington Cascades were within 37 miles (60 km) of the coast. In Oregon, marbled murrelets are observed most often within 12 miles (20 km) of the ocean. Many marbled murrelets regularly visit coastal lakes. Most lakes used by marbled murrelets are within 12 miles (20 km) of the ocean, but a few birds have been found at lakes as far inland as 47 miles (75 km). All lakes used by marbled murrelets occur within potential nesting habitat. =Nesting habitat= From southeast Alaska southward, marbled murrelets use mature or old-growth forest stands near the coastline for nesting. These forests are generally characterized by large trees (>32 inches [80 cm] diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)), a multistoried canopy, moderate to high canopy closure or an open crown canopy,Marshall, David B. (1989). The marbled murrelet. Audubon Wildlife Report, pp. 435‚Äì455 large snags, and numerous downed snags in all stages of decay. Marbled murrelets tend to nest in the oldest trees in the stand. In Oregon, forests begin to exhibit old-growth characteristics at about 175 to 250 years of age. Moss, on which marbled murrelets nest, forms on the limbs of Douglas-fir that are more than 150 years old. The only four marbled murrelet tree nests found before 1990 shared the following characteristics: (1) located in a large tree (>47 inches [120 cm] d.b.h.) with an open crown structure, (2) on a moss-covered limb that is camouflaged, partially shaded, and approximately horizontal with a diameter (including associated moss) of at least 14 inches (36 cm), and (3) located within the middle or lower part of a live crown. However, Marshall stated that because of their low aerial buoyancy marbled murrelets often nest high in the treetops or on steep slopes. Habitat must be sufficiently open to allow for easy flight. All marbled murrelet nests found in Washington, Oregon, and California were located in old-growth trees that ranged from 38 inches (88 cm) d.b.h. to 210 inches (533 cm) d.b.h. with a mean of 80 inches (203 cm) d.b.h. Nests were located high above the ground and had good overhead protection but allowed easy access to the exterior forest. It was initially believed that marbled murrelets might use the same nest in successive years but there has been little evidence of this. Stand size is also important in nest sites. Marbled murrelets more commonly occupy stands greater than 500 acres (202 ha) than stands less than 100 acres (40 ha). However, marbled murrelets may nest in remnant old-growth trees or groves that are surrounded by younger trees. In California, marbled murrelets are usually absent from stands less than 60 acres (24 ha) in size. In Washington, marbled murrelets are found more often when old-growth and mature forests make up over 30% of the landscape. Fewer marbled murrelets are found when clearcut and meadow areas make up more than 25% of the landscape. Concentrations of marbled murrelets offshore are almost always adjacent to old-growth or mature forests onshore, although marbled murrelets may not use the interior of dense stands. Where large trees are absent in the northern parts of marbled murrelet range, marbled murrelets nest in depressions on the ground, in rock cavities on the ground, or on rock outcrops. Marbled murrelets are both ground nesters and tree nesters where forests and treeless areas meet. Plant communities In northern regions where coniferous forests nest sites are unavailable, marbled murrelets occupy alpine or tundra near the ocean. In Washington and Oregon, marbled murrelets commonly nest in Douglas- fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominated stands. They also select stands dominated by mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) for nesting. In California, nests are most often located in redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) dominated stands with scattered Sitka spruce, western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Douglas-fir. Marbled murrelets also occur in stands dominated by Port-Orford- cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). =Foraging habitat= Marbled murrelets forage in the ocean near shore and in inland saltwater areas such as bays, sounds, and saltwater passageways. Some also forage on inland freshwater lakes. Flocks of 50 or more birds have been observed near freshwater lakes. Subadults occur at sea throughout the summer. Marbled murrelets feed within 1,640 feet (500 m) of shore. =Winter habitat= Marbled murrelet winter habitat is the same as the nesting and foraging habitat. During the winter marbled murrelets use inland old-growth or mature sites for roosting, courtship, and investigating nest sites. The use of inland lakes during the nonbreeding season occurs in conjunction with visits to nesting areas. Predators Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and common ravens (Corvus corax) prey on marbled murrelet eggs and nestlings. Marbled murrelets and humans The marbled murrelet is considered globally endangered, with some evidence of decline across its range over the last few decades. The biggest threat to the marbled murrelet was long considered to be loss of nesting habitat (old-growth and mature forests) to logging. Additional factors including high predation rates due to human disturbances and climate-driven changes in ocean conditions are also considered important now. Scientists at Redwood National Park have established a connection between human presence in marbled murrelet territory and corvid predation of marbled murrelet chicks. Corvid populations, such as Steller's jays, crows, and ravens, are expanding into old-growth forests. Lured by food scraps left by campers and hikers, with increased access aggravated by the patchwork forests created by industrial logging, corvids more frequently discover marbled murrelet nests in areas where these predator species were not previously found. The marbled murrelet populations in Washington, Oregon and California were listed as threatened in 1992 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service due to concerns about loss of nesting habitat, entanglement in fishing gear and oil spills. The Canadian population was declared \\"nationally threatened\\" in 1990. The status of Alaskan populations is currently under review. The species became a flagship species in efforts to prevent the logging of old-growth forests along the Pacific coast from California to Alaska.

He was not related to the much more famous Michael Praetorius, though the Praetorius family had many distinguished musicians throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Life He was born in Hamburg, and spent most of his life there. Praetorius studied organ early with his father (Jacob Praetorius, the elder (1520-1586), also a composer), afterwards going to Cologne for further study. In 1580 he became organist in Erfurt, but only remained there two years, returning to Hamburg in 1582. Back in Hamburg he worked with his father as assistant organist at St. Jacobi, becoming principal organist in 1586 when his father died. His son, Jacob, was born that same year, and was also destined to become a composer. In 1596 he went to Gr√∂ningen where he met Michael Praetorius and Hans Leo Hassler; presumably he became acquainted with their music, and through them the music of the contemporary Italian Venetian School, at this time. He remained in Hamburg as organist at St. Jacobi until his death. Music and influence Praetorius wrote masses, ten settings of the Magnificat, and numerous motets, mostly in Latin. Most of his music is in the Venetian polychoral style, which uses numerous voices divided into several groups. These compositions are the first to be written in north Germany in the progressive Venetian style. Choir sizes range from 8 to 20, with the voices divided into two, three or four groups, and he must have had well-trained and sophisticated musicians at his disposal, considering both the amount and the difficulty of music he wrote for these ensembles. While progressive in writing in the Venetian style, he was conservative in using Latin and avoiding the basso continuo, which was eagerly adopted by many other contemporary German composers. Most of his vocal music is a cappella. Praetorius was also the first composer to compile a collection of four-part German chorales with organ accompaniment, a sound which was to become a standard in Protestant churches for several centuries. The music in the collection was compiled from four churches in Hamburg; 21 of the 88 settings are of his own composition. Some of his organ compositions survive, including nine settings of the Magnificat, which are in a highly contrapuntal cantus firmus style. In addition to these settings, numerous anonymous pieces in north German collections of the time are now attributed with reasonable certainty to Hieronymus Praetorius.

In the home, point-of-use humidifiers are commonly used to humidify a single room, while whole-house or furnace humidifiers, which connect to a home's HVAC system, provide humidity to the entire house. Medical ventilators often include humidifiers for increased patient comfort. Large humidifiers are used in commercial, institutional, or industrial contexts, often as part of a larger HVAC system. Overview Low humidity may occur in hot, dry desert climates, or indoors in artificially heated spaces. In winter, especially when cold outside air is heated indoors, the humidity may drop to as low as 10‚Äì20%. This low humidity can cause adverse health effects, by drying out mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose and throat, and can cause respiratory distress. The low humidity also can affect wooden furniture, causing shrinkage and loose joints or cracking of pieces. Books, papers, and artworks may shrink or warp and become brittle in very low humidity. In addition, static electricity may become a problem in conditions of low humidity, destroying semiconductor devices, causing static cling of textiles, and causing dust and small particles to stick stubbornly to electrically charged surfaces. Overuse of a humidifier can raise the relative humidity to excessive levels, promoting the growth of dust mites and mold, and can also cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (humidifier lung). A relative humidity of 30% to 50% is recommended for most homes. A properly installed and located hygrostat should be used to monitor and control humidity levels automatically, or a well-informed and conscientious human operator must constantly check for correct humidity levels. Industrial humidifiers Industrial humidifiers are used when a specific humidity level must be maintained to prevent static electricity buildup, preserve material properties, and ensure a comfortable and healthy environment for workers or residents. Static problems are prevalent in industries such as packaging, printing, paper, plastics, textiles, electronics, automotive manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Friction can produce static buildup and sparks when humidity is below 45% relative humidity (RH). Between 45% and 55% RH, static builds up at reduced levels, while humidity above 55% RH ensures that static will never build up. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has traditionally recommended a range of 45‚Äì55% RH in data centers to prevent sparks that can damage IT equipment. Humidifiers are also used by manufacturers of semiconductors and in hospital operating rooms. Printers and paper manufacturers use humidifiers to prevent shrinkage and paper curl. Humidifiers are needed in cold storage rooms to preserve the freshness of food against the dryness caused by hot temperatures. Art museums use humidifiers to protect sensitive works of art, especially in exhibition galleries, where they combat the dryness caused by heating for the comfort of visitors during winter.  Portable humidifiers  A \\"portable\\" humidifier may range in size from a small tabletop appliance to a large floor-mounted unit. The water is usually supplied by manually filling the unit on a periodic basis. = Evaporative humidifiers = The most common portable humidifier, an \\"evaporative\\", \\"cool moisture\\", or \\"wick humidifier\\", consists of just a few basic parts: a reservoir, wick and fan. The wick is made of a porous material that absorbs water from the reservoir and provides a larger surface area for it to evaporate from. The fan is adjacent to the wick and blows air onto the wick to aid in the evaporation of the water. Evaporation from the wick is dependent on relative humidity. A room with low humidity will have a higher evaporation rate compared to a room with high humidity. Therefore, this type of humidifier is partially self-regulating; as the humidity of the room increases, the water vapor output naturally decreases. These wicks become moldy if they are not dried out completely between fillings, and become saturated with mineral deposits over time. They regularly need rinsing or replacement; if this does not happen, air cannot pass through them, and humidifier stops humidifying the area it is in and the water in the tank remains at the same level. = Natural humidifiers = Vaporizer (steam humidifier) (warm mist humidifier) Impeller humidifier NW-5 (Poland, 1977) One type of evaporative humidifier makes use of just a reservoir and wick. Sometimes called a \\"natural humidifier\\", these are usually non-commercial devices that can be assembled at little or no cost. One version of a natural humidifier uses a stainless steel bowl, partially filled with water, covered by a towel. A waterproof weight is used to sink the towel in the center of the bowl. There is no need for a fan, because the water spreads through the towel by capillary action and the towel surface area is large enough to provide for rapid evaporation. The stainless steel bowl is much easier to clean than typical humidifier water tanks. This, in combination with daily or every other day replacement of the towel and periodic laundering, can control the problem of mold and bacteria. Houseplants may also be used as natural humidifiers, since they evaporate water into the air through transpiration. Care must still be taken to prevent bacteria or mold in the soil from growing to excessive levels, or from dispersing into the air. = Vaporizers = A vaporizer (steam humidifier, warm mist humidifier) heats or boils water, releasing steam and moisture into the air. A medicated inhalant can also be added to the steam vapor to help reduce coughs. Vaporizers may be healthier than cool mist types of humidifiers because steam is less likely to convey mineral impurities or microorganisms from the standing water in the reservoir. However, boiling water requires significantly more energy than other techniques. The heat source in poorly designed humidifiers can overheat, causing the product to melt, leak, and start fires. = Impeller humidifiers = An impeller humidifier (cool mist humidifier) uses a rotating disc to fling water at a diffuser, which breaks the water into fine droplets that float into the air. The water supply must be kept scrupulously clean, or there is a risk of spreading bacteria or mold into the air. These types of humidifiers are usually noisier than others. = Ultrasonic humidifiers = Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier An ultrasonic humidifier uses a ceramic diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets that silently exit the humidifier in the form of cool fog. Usually the mist gets forced out by a tiny fan, while some ultra mini models have no fans. The models without fans are meant mainly for personal use. Ultrasonic humidifiers use a piezoelectric transducer to create a high frequency (1-2 MHz) mechanical oscillation in a film of water. This forms an extremely fine mist of droplets about one micron in diameter, that is quickly evaporated into the air flow. Unlike the humidifiers that boil water, these water droplets will contain any impurities that are in the reservoir, including minerals from hard water (which then forms a difficult-to-remove sticky white dust on nearby objects and furniture). Any pathogens growing in the stagnant tank will also be dispersed in the air. Ultrasonic humidifiers should be cleaned regularly to prevent bacterial contamination from being spread throughout the air. The amount of minerals and other materials can be greatly reduced by using distilled water. Special disposable demineralization cartridges may also reduce the amount of airborne material, but the EPA warns, \\"the ability of these devices to remove minerals may vary widely.\\" The mineral dust may have negative health effects. Wick humidifiers trap the mineral deposits in the wick; vaporizer types tend to collect minerals on or around the heating element and require regular cleaning with vinegar or citric acid to control buildup.  Fixed-installation humidifiers  For buildings with a forced-air furnace, a humidifier may be installed into the furnace. They can also protect wooden objects, antiques and other furnishings which may be sensitive to damage from overly dry air. In colder months, they may provide modest energy savings, since as humidity increases, occupants may feel warm at a lower temperature. Bypass humidifiers are connected between the heated and cold air return ducts, using the pressure difference between these ducts to cause some heated air to make a bypass through the humidifier and return to the furnace. Any humidifiers should usually be disabled during the summer months if air conditioning is used; air conditioners partially function to reducing indoor humidity, and having a humidifier continue to operate will waste significant amounts of energy. = Drums = Drum style (bypass) uses a pipe to bring water directly to a reservoir (a pan) attached to the furnace. The water level in the pan is controlled by a float valve, similar to a small toilet tank float. The wick is typically a foam pad mounted on a drum and attached to a small motor; hot air enters the drum at one end and is forced to leave through the sides of the drum. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out. :Advantages include: :* Low cost :* Inexpensive maintenance (drum-style pads are cheap and readily available) :Disadvantages include: :* Requirement for frequent (approximately monthly) inspections of cleanliness and pad condition :* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream) :* Mold growth in the pan full of water (this problem is exacerbated by the large quantity of air, inevitably carrying mold spores, passing through the humidifier whether in use or not). For the latter reason especially, drum- style humidifiers should always be turned off at the water supply during summer (air conditioning) months, and should always be used with high quality furnace air filters (MERV ratings as high as possible to ensure small numbers of mold spores reaching the humidifier pan) when the water supply is turned on. = Disc wheels = A disc wheel style (bypass) is very similar in design to the drum style humidifiers; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming with a number of plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the disc wheel does not need regular replacement. :Advantages include: :* Very low maintenance (basin of humidifier should be cleaned out periodically, unless an automatic flushing device is installed) :* No regular replacement of parts necessary :* Higher output due to large evaporative surface area :* Can be installed in hard water situations :* Maintains efficiency throughout lifespans :Disadvantages include: :* Higher price :* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream) = Bypass flow-through = Bypass flow-through style (bypass ‚Äì also known as \\"biscuit style\\" or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve at the top of the humidifier. Air passes through an aluminum \\"biscuit\\" (often called a pad; the term \\"biscuit\\" emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse steel wool. The \\"biscuit\\" has a coating of a matte ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the \\"biscuit\\". Hot air is passed through the \\"biscuit\\", causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building. :Advantages include: :* Reduced maintenance (new \\"biscuit\\" is needed only when clogged with dust or mineral deposits, typically once per year) :* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier :* No incidental humidification caused by a constantly replenished pan of water in a high velocity air stream :* Reduced requirement for expensive air filters :* Uses little electricity :Disadvantages include: :* A somewhat higher purchase price :* Manufacturer and model-specific replacement biscuits (versus the relatively generic drum-style pads) may be more expensive and difficult to find :* For most models, a portion of the water supplied to the unit is not evaporated. This can generate a considerable amount of waste water containing residual minerals, which does require connection to a drain. There is a limited selection of drain-less models that recirculate water, but mineral buildup must then be removed manually on a periodic basis. = Spray mist = Spray mist type uses a pipe, usually a small plastic one, to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve (atomizer-this forces the water through a tiny orifice causing it to break up into tiny particles) in the humidifier. Water mist is sprayed directly into the supply air, and the mist is carried into the premises by the air flow. :Advantages include: :* Simpler than bypass types to install, requiring a single cut hole for installation, no additional ducting. :* Uses little electricity. :* Small, compact unit which fits where other types cannot. (Approximately square.) :* Because it does not require bypass ducting it does not undermine the pressure separation (and therefore, blower efficiency) of the return and supply ducts. :* Does not require use of moisture pads (on-going expense). :* Highly efficient usage of water. Does not generate waste water, and does not require separate connection to a drain. :* Requires little maintenance. Periodic cleaning of nozzle may be required in hard water environments. :* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier. :Disadvantages include: :* Spray nozzle can become clogged in hard water situations, necessitating the use of water filter, periodic cleaning of nozzle, or nozzle replacement. :* Disperses any minerals in the water into the airstream. = Additional types = Additional types include non-bypass flow- through (fan augmented), steam, impeller or centrifugal atomizer, and under duct designs.  Problems  The USEPA provides detailed information about health risks as well as recommended maintenance procedures. If the tap water contains a lot of minerals (also known as \\"hard water\\") then the ultrasonic or impeller humidifiers will produce a \\"white DUST\\" (calcium is the most common mineral in tap water), which usually spreads over furniture, and is attracted to static electricity generating devices such as CRT monitors. The white dust can be prevented by using distilled water or a demineralization cartridge in ultrasonic humidifiers. In addition, a stuck or malfunctioning water supply valve can deliver large amounts of water, causing extensive water damage if undetected for any period of time. A water alarm, possibly with an automatic water shutoff, can help prevent this malfunction from causing major problems.

The music celebrates the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) in 1748. The work was very popular when first performed and following Handel‚Äôs death. Mozart called the work a ‚Äúspectacle of English pride and joy.‚Äù  Rehearsal and final production  During the preparations Handel and the Duke of Montagu, the Master-General of the Ordnance and the officer responsible for the Royal Fireworks, had an argument about adding violins. The duke made clear to Handel that King George had a preference for only martial instruments (winds and percussion), and hoped there would be \\"no fiddles\\". Handel omitted the string instruments against his will. Also against Handel's will, there was a full rehearsal of the music in Vauxhall Gardens and not in Green Park. On 21 April 1749 an audience, claimed to be over twelve thousand people, each paying two shillings and six pence (half a crown) rushed to get there, causing a three-hour traffic jam of carriages on London Bridge, the only vehicular route to the area south of the river. Six days later, on 27 April, the performing musicians were in a specially constructed building that had been designed by Servandoni, a theatre designer, who used four Italians to assist him.Jacob Simon (1985) Handel, a celebration of his life and times, 1685‚Äì1759, p. 212.

Charles Frederick was the controller, captain Thomas Desaguliers was the chief fire master. The display was not as successful as the music itself: the weather was rainy causing many misfires and in the middle of the show the right pavilion caught fire. Also, a woman's clothes were set on alight by a stray rocket and other fireworks burned two soldiers and blinded a third. Yet another soldier had blown his hand off during an earlier rehearsal for the 101 cannons which were used during the event.  Music and instrumentation  Music for the Royal Fireworks opens with a French overture and includes a bourr√©e and two minuets. The work is in five movements: #Overture (Adagio ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Lentement ‚Äì Allegro) #Bourr√©e #La Paix (Largo alla siciliana) #La R√©jouissance (Allegro) #Menuets I and II It was scored for a large wind band ensemble consisting of 24 oboes, 12 bassoons and a contrabassoon, nine natural trumpets, nine natural horns, three pairs of kettledrums, and side drums which were given only the direction to play ad libitum; no side drum parts were written by Handel. Handel was specific about the numbers of instruments to each written part. In the overture there are assigned three players to each of the three trumpet parts; the 24 oboes are divided 12, 8 and 4; and the 12 bassoons are divided 8 and 4. The side drums were instructed when to play in La R√©jouissance and the second Menuet, but very likely also played in the Ouverture. Handel re-scored the suite for full orchestra for a performance on 27 May in the Foundling Hospital. Handel noted in the score that the violins were to play the oboe parts, the cellos and double basses the bassoon part, and the violas either a lower wind or bass part. The instruments from the original band instrumentation play all the movements in the revised orchestral edition except the Bourr√©e and the first Menuet, which are played by the oboes, bassoons, and strings alone.Preface notes and score Fr. Chrysander, Water-Music, Firework-Music, Concertos and Double Concertos for Full Orchestra by George Frederic Handel, reprinted 1965, Gregg Press, New Jersey, US  Recordings  There are many recordings. Handel's Water Music, although it was composed more than thirty years earlier, is often paired with the Music for the Royal Fireworks as both were written for outdoor performance. Together, these works arguably constitute Handel's most famous music for what we would now consider the orchestra. Older recordings tend to use arrangements of Handel's score for the modern orchestra, for example, the arrangements by Hamilton Harty (1923) and Leopold Stokowski. Charles Mackerras¬¥ 1959 recording for Pye Records marked a return to Handel¬¥s orchestration. More recent recordings tend to use more historically informed performance methods appropriate for baroque music and often use authentic instruments. There are also arrangements for pipe organ, alone or with brass. In 1970, Jos√© Feliciano recorded for his Fireworks LP part of the work transcribed for classical guitar by himself. This music was performed under the baton of Andrew Davis for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II on 1 June 2002, at the Buckingham Palace gardens, complete with fireworks.

Cape Cod and Cape Cod Bay from space, April 1997. Dennis. Cape Cod Bay is a large bay of the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Measuring below a line drawn from Brant Rock in Marshfield to Race Point in Provincetown, Massachusetts, it is enclosed by Cape Cod to the south and east, and Plymouth County, Massachusetts, to the west. To the north of Cape Cod Bay lie Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Cape Cod Bay is the southernmost extremity of the Gulf of Maine. Cape Cod Bay is one of the bays adjacent to Massachusetts that give it the name Bay State. The others are Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay, and Massachusetts Bay. History In 1524, Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to discover Cape Cod Bay, his claim proved by a map of 1529 which clearly outlined Cape Cod. In 1620, the Pilgrims first sheltered in Provincetown Harbor where they signed the Mayflower Compact, the first democratic document signed in the New World. Geology Most of Cape Cod is composed of glacially derived rocks, sands, and gravels. The last glacial period ended about 12,000 years ago. During the end of the last glaciation, Cape Cod Bay was probably a large freshwater lake with drainages across Cape Cod in places like Bass River and Orleans Harbor. The Provincetown Spit, i.e., the land north of High Head in North Truro, was formed by marine deposits over the last 5,000-8,000 years. These deposits created Provincetown Harbor, a large, bowl-shaped section of Cape Cod Bay. Generally, currents in the Bay move in a counter-clockwise fashion, moving south from Boston, to Plymouth then east and then north to Provincetown. Since 1914, Cape Cod Bay has been connected to Buzzards Bay by the Cape Cod Canal, which divides the upper cape towns of Bourne and Sandwich. Ecology The sea life of the bay is quite varied and healthy. Fish such as Flounder, Blue-Finned Tuna, Sand Eel and Striped Bass all call the bay home. Sea mammals are also quite common in Cape Cod Bay such as seals, dolphins and whales. The Pilgrims shot at a whale unsuccessfully while they were anchored in Provincetown Harbor in 1620. Fishing Cape Cod Bay draws a lot of attention during fishing season with popular deep-sea charter boats, private boat fishing, fly fishing & whale watching. Fisherman typically fish off the coast of the South Shore (Massachusetts) and inner cape for fish such as Blue Fish, Cod, Flounder, Striped Bass, Bonito, Tuna, Mackerel, Pollock, Haddock, and even Sharks.. \\"Deep Sea Fishing.\\" Captain John. N.p.. Web. 6 Dec 2012. . Fishing season typically takes place between May and October. Although plenty of fisherman prefer to fish from shore rather than a boat, Massachusetts requires a Recreational Saltwater Fishing Permit for anyone 16 years of age or older.\\"Massachusetts Recreational Saltwater Fishing Permit.\\" Massachusetts Saltwater. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Dec 2012. Many coastal towns have fishing piers, and boat charters that provide daily trips into Cape Cod Bay to catch fish. The most popular bait used is sea clams.

Its current design dates to 2013, a modification of a design adopted in 1976. Description The flag consists of the Commonwealth symbol in gold on a blue field. The symbol centres on a globe, representing the global nature of the Commonwealth and the breadth of its membership. History The Commonwealth Flag flying at the Canadian Houses of Parliament, alt= The flag developed from car pennants produced for the first time at the 1973 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, held in Ottawa, Ontario. The initiative for its design is credited to two Canadians: the first Commonwealth Secretary-General, Arnold Smith; and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. It was officially adopted on 26 March 1976. =Original design= The original design featured a globe surrounded by 61 radiating, approximately quadrilateral, sunrays, which form a 'C' for 'Commonwealth'. The number of sunrays did not represent the number of member states (there have never been 61 members); instead, the large number represented the many ways in which the Commonwealth cooperates around the world. =2013 redesign= In 2013, the globe was tilted, and the number of sunrays reduced to 34. The colourings used in the flag were also slightly modified. The standard proportions of the flag are 3:5, however it a 1:2 version appears in countries whose flags use a 1:2 ratio, such as Australia and the UK. Usage The flag of the Commonwealth of Nations is flown at Marlborough House, London, the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat, throughout the year, and for a limited period at other venues where Commonwealth meetings, events, or visits are taking place (for example, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings). The Canadian federal government does not stipulate that the flag be flown for Commonwealth Day, instead directing that the British Union Jack (officially called the Royal Union Flag) be flown at federal installations which have a second flagpole. Former Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon encourages the flying of the Commonwealth flag on Commonwealth Day, and the Office of the Secretary-General notes that \\"it is not the case that the Union Jack ‚Äì or the flag of any other member country for that matter ‚Äì is a substitute for the Commonwealth flag which represents the association of 53 members and their peoples.\\"Letter from the office of the Commonwealth Secretary-General, January 30, 2008 Elsewhere, the Commonwealth flag is flown at the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh on Commonwealth Day, from the fourth flagpole in addition to the Union Flag, the Scottish saltire and the European Union flag which all fly daily. Since 2002 the Commonwealth flag has been flown alongside the Union Flag, over the Northern Ireland Assembly's home at Parliament Buildings Stormont every Commonwealth Day. It is also flown on Commonwealth Day in the territory of Gibraltar, from the third flagpole alongside the Union Flag and the Flag of Gibraltar, which fly on the roof of No. 6 Convent Place, the office of the Chief Minister of Gibraltar. On 28 September 2016, the Welsh Conservative AM in the National Assembly for Wales Mohammad Asghar suggested that once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the Welsh Assembly should replace the EU Flag alongside the Union Flag and the Welsh Flag. It has been suggested that the Flag of the Commonwealth be the replacement.http://www.assembly.wales/en/bus- home/pages/plenaryitem.aspx?category=statements+of+opinion&itemid;=789&c;=Statements+of+Opinion On 31 January 2020 Brexit was marked at the Gibraltar border with the lowering of the EU flag and the raising of the Commonwealth flag in its place.

Patrick Scott was born in Kilbrittain, County Cork, in 1921, and had his first exhibition in 1944, but trained as an architect and did not become a full-time artist until 1960. He worked for fifteen years for the Irish architect Michael Scott, assisting, for example, in the design of Bus√°ras, the central bus station in Dublin. He was also responsible for the orange livery of Irish intercity trains. Scott was perhaps best known for his gold paintings, abstracts incorporating geometrical forms in gold leaf against a pale tempura background. He also produced tapestries and carpets. His paintings are in several important collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He won the Guggenheim Award in 1960, represented Ireland in the 1960 Venice Biennale, the Douglas Hyde Gallery held a major retrospective of his work in 1981 and the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin held a major survey in 2002. His works are distinguished by their purity and sense of calm, reflecting his own interest in Zen Buddhism. In October 2013, Scott wed his companion of 30 years, Eric Pearce, in a civil ceremony at the Dublin Registry Office.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/artist-scott-93-weds- partner-247184.html On 11 July 2007, Scott, who was a founding member of Aosd√°na, was conferred with the title of Saoi, the highest honour that can be bestowed upon an Irish artist. The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, made the presentation, placing a gold torc, the symbol of the office of Saoi, around his neck.

She grew up in Chicago.\\"Margaret Sloan-Hunter, noted feminist activist, writer and lecturer, succumbs\\" in Jet Magazine, November 1, 2004. Career When Sloan-Hunter was 14, she joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a group that worked on poverty and urban issues on behalf of the African- American community in Chicago. At the age of 17, she founded the Junior Catholic Inter-Racial Council, a mix of suburban and inner-city students who talked about and worked on racial problems. In 1966, Sloan-Hunter worked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and in the \\"Open Housing Marches\\".Sloan-Hunter, Margaret. \\"Author Biography\\" in For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology, Onlywomen Press, 1988, , p. 588. Sloan-Hunter also became one of the first editors of Ms., a magazine supporting the feminist movement. Along with editing, she traveled to speak on issues of sexism and racism throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. Sloan-Hunter paired up with Jane Galvin-Lewis, a former writer of Ms., to challenge racism and sexism as interlocking oppressions. To get involved further, Sloan-Hunter and Galvin-Lewis paired up with Florynce Kennedy in 1973 to speak on college campuses around the country. Their events became places for other black feminists to find each other and create support groups. This led Sloan-Hunter, Kennedy, and others to create the NBFO or National Black Feminist Organization. In the NBFO, many women worked to define the specific oppression black women face. Through the NBFO, Sloan-Hunter tackled some of the same race and feminist issues she grew up fighting for. In 1975, she and her daughter Kathleen Sloan moved to Oakland, California, where they established the Women's Foundation. She also helped organize the Berkeley Women‚Äôs Center and the Feminist School for Girls.Ms. Magazine, October 15, 2004, Obits. Sloan-Hunter was an intersectionality activist, fighting for African American, feminist, and lesbian causes. Sloan-Hunter published a book of poetry called Black & Lavender in 1995.Sloan-Hunter, Margaret. Black & Lavender, 1995, This was a series of thirty-eight poems written about Sloan- Hunter's life. Education Margaret Sloan-Hunter won many awards for public speaking in high school. Margaret Sloan-Hunter went on to Chicago City College and Malcolm X College to major in speech. After this, she received a degree in Women‚Äôs Studies at Antioch University in San Francisco. Death Margaret died in Oakland, California when she was 57 years old.

Released in late 1851 with a copyright of 1852, it is the final collection of tales by Hawthorne published in his lifetime. Background After publishing his collection Mosses from an Old Manse in 1846, Hawthorne mostly turned away from the short tales that had marked the majority of his career to that point. In the interim period leading up to the collection The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales, he wrote only four new stories: \\"Main-street\\", \\"Feathertop\\", \\"The Snow-Image\\", and \\"The Great Stone Face\\".Quirk, Tom. Nothing Abstract: Investigations in the American Literary Imagination. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 2001: 64. All but \\"Feathertop\\" would be included in the new collection along with several other previously-published works. In his preface to the collection, Hawthorne playfully noted that his confessional tone in writing about himself should not be trusted: \\"[T]hese things hide the man instead of displaying him\\", he wrote, and suggested that readers seeking \\"essential traits\\" of the author \\"must make quite another kind of inquest\\", specifically that \\"you must look through the whole range of his fictitious characters, good and evil\\".Porte, Joel. n Respect to Egotism: Studies in American Romantic Writing.

Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 245. Hawthorne dedicated the collection to his friend Horatio Bridge, who had subsidized his first collection years earlier. In his dedicatory letter, Hawthorne directly addressed Bridge: \\"If anybody is responsible for my being at this day an author, it is yourself.\\" Hawthorne also fondly recalled the time he shared with Bridge as students at Bowdoin College: Bridge believed that Hawthorne \\"overvalued\\" his friendship but after Hawthorne's death his widow Sophia Hawthorne assured him that the admiration was deserved: \\"He had the utmost reliance upon you, and reposed upon it with infinite satisfaction.

A back row forward, Charvis was equally adept as a flanker or as the no. 8. Charvis became the world record try scorer for a forward in test match rugby on 24 November 2007 v South Africa at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff with his 22nd international try. In 2011 he was overtaken by Takashi Kikutani of Japan on the List of leading rugby union test try scorers. Charvis has 2 caps for the British and Irish Lions; both appearances were against Australia in 2001. In 2013 Charvis took on the Absa Cape Epic, an eight-day team stage race that traverses the Western Cape region of South Africa. Having ridden over 700 km with 15 000m of vertical climbing, Charvis completed the race as an Individual Finisher after his partner withdrew. Early life Charvis was born in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, on 27 December 1972 to Lloyd and Lynne Charvis.

Charvis is of Jamaican heritage through his father.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales- news/colin-charvis-puts-grannygate-scandal-10512272 1995-2003: Swansea His first cap for Wales was in 1996 against Australia: he went on to become team captain for a period and toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions in 2001. Charvis in action against England He remained with Swansea until changes in the Welsh club structure saw him without a contract in the period of the 2003 Rugby World Cup. 2003-2007: Tarbes, Newcastle and Newport  Charvis moved briefly to Tarbes in France and then to Newcastle Falcons in England whom he also captained. Charvis's contract with the Falcons was not renewed at the end of the 2005-6 season. He subsequently joined the Newport Gwent Dragons. He made his debut for the club in August in a pre-season friendly against the Cornish Pirates Wales Charvis has scored 22 tries for his country, making him the leading try scorer among all Welsh forwards. He is also one of only four forwards to score over 100 international points (John Eales, Carlo Checchinato and Takashi Kikutani are the others). He was the second most capped player for Wales and the most capped forward with 94 caps until overtaken by Martyn Williams 13 March 2010. He also featured in the 1999 Rugby World Cup and captained Wales in the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. In 2000, Charvis was implicated in Grannygate as he had been first capped for Wales in 1996 while apparently ineligible. However, by the time the scandal broke he had completed the required 3 years residency period and no further action was taken. After appearances against England, Scotland, Ireland and Italy in the 2006 Six Nations, Charvis had a spell away from the international scene. However, his form for the Dragons throughout the 2006‚Äì2007 season saw him named in Gareth Jenkins's touring squad to Australia in May 2007. He appeared in both Tests and following the tour, Charvis was named in Gareth Jenkins' 41-man preliminary Rugby World Cup 2007 summer training squad. He made the final 30-man squad in August after playing in the Test against England and made substitute appearances in both Invesco Perpetual Summer Series matches against Argentina and France. Charvis made a try-scoring substitute appearance in Wales's opening Pool B match against Canada, and made the starting line-ups for the remaining Pool clashes with Australia, Japan and Fiji. In November 2007 Wales Caretaker Coach Nigel Davies included Charvis in his starting line-up for the inaugural Prince William Cup clash with South Africa. Despite the 34-12 defeat to the reigning world champions Charvis scored his 22nd try for his country in the clash, becoming the world's top forward try-scorer to date. 2008-2010: Player-coach Charvis was appointed to a player/coach role at Newport Gwent Dragons in July 2008. However, because of injuries amongst the playing squad Charvis returned to the team, and as a result of his excellent form he played a number of matches during the 2008-09 season, but then retired as a player in order to be full-time forwards and defence coach. He parted company with the Dragons in late September 2010.Charvis leaves Dragons Post-professional career After leaving his professional playing days behind Charvis toured with JML Welsh Warriors, a semi-professional rugby union team, to the annual Manila 10s tournament, winning the Cup Division in their inaugural appearance at the tournament. In 2000, Charvis appearing stripped bare as the muscular Atlas with the world on his both shoulders and doing squats for S4C's Chwaraeon/Sport 2000 promotional video.

In optical storage, constant linear velocity (CLV) is a qualifier for the rated speed of an optical disc drive, and may also be applied to the writing speed of recordable discs. CLV implies that the angular velocity (i.e. rpm) varies during an operation, as contrasted with CAV modes. The concept of constant linear velocity was patented in 1886 by phonograph pioneers Chichester Bell and Charles Tainter.  History  Laserdiscs, the first consumer optical discs, used constant linear velocity to double playback time (CLV / \\"extended play\\" discs can hold 1 hour per side; CAV / \\"standard play\\" discs can only hold 30 minutes). As the motor's speed decreases from 1,800 to 600 rpm when the read head moves away from the center (which is the start of the recording), the disc constantly moves past the read head at a constant speed. Later optical formats such as the audio CD also employ CLV to maintain both a constant data rate and a constant bit density. Their rotation gradually decreases from 495 to 212 rpm to keep the disc moving past the read laser at (assuming 1:1 playback speed and Red Book encoding). To accommodate the higher data transfer rates and random access requirements of modern CD-ROM drives, CAV systems are used. This is because seek performance would be greatly affected during random access by the requirement to continually modulate the disc's rotation speed to be appropriate for the read head's position.  Dimensions  Dimensions of a standard-size (12cm diameter) optical disc In case of a 12 cm standard diameter disc, data at the inner edge of the so-called program area, the area containing the data (2.5 cm from disc center) is accessed at 2.4 times the angular (rotation) speed of the disc compared to at the outer edge (6 cm from disc center).FUNDAMENTOS DE HARDWARE. ‚Äì Page 37 of 45 (graphic) For a miniature disc with a diameter of 8 cm (radius of 4 cm), the angular (rotation) speed ratio of outer to inner data edge is 1.6 if accessed at a constant linear velocity. This means that, for example, at a constant linar velocity of √ó10, the equivalent angular velocity of the disc is √ó24 while the being accessed at the inner data area, while being √ó10 during access at the outermost edge. Zoned Constant Linear Velocity The Zone-CLV recording strategy is easily visible after burning a DVD-R Zoned Constant Linear Velocity (ZCLV or Z-CLV) is a modification of CLV for high speed CD and DVD recorders where a constant linear velocity is maintained until the next zone, when the speed is stepped up. Early model recorders were CLV drives. The recording speed on such drives was rated in multiples of 150 KiB/s; a 4X drive, for instance, would write steadily at around 600 KiB/s. The transfer rate was kept constant by having the spindle motor in the drive vary in speed and run 2.4 timesFUNDAMENTOS DE HARDWARE. ‚Äì Page 37 of 45 (graphic) as fast when recording at the inner rim of the disc as on the outer rim. Some high-speed recorders use the zoned CLV method (ZCLV), which divides the disc into stepped zones, each of which has its own constant linear velocity. When the current zone is finished and the next zone is reached, the disc rotation will speed up, usually to the same angular speed as at the beginning of the previous zone. At higher speeds, ZCLV offers a compromise between CAV, which enables faster seek times, and CLV, which enables greater writing reliability. A ZCLV recorder rated at \\"52X\\", for example, would write at a 52X disc rpm on the innermost zone and then progressively step down to 20X disc rpm at the outer rim to keep the rate at which bits are recorded by the laser within a narrow range.QPxTool glossary ‚Äì Zoned CLVUnderstanding DVD -Recording Speed by Optical Storage Technology Association ‚Äì Section: Zoned Constant Linear Velocity (ZCLV) This method is used for higher-speed CD-RW variants due to the narrow writing speed range of rewriteable media. Constant Angular Acceleration Constant Angular Acceleration (CAA) is a variant of CLV that is used on the Laserdisc format. The initial specification of CLV (as it applies to laserdisc) results in several playback artifacts to be present in the audio/video portion as well as compatibility problems with Laserdisc players as produced by different manufacturers. In the mid 1980s, Pioneer Electronics introduced the CAA scheme where the speed in rotation of the Laserdisc was lowered in steps and eliminated most playback artifacts and compatibility problems. Since its introduction, most manufacturers of Laserdiscs adopted the CAA format but still referred to their CAA-encoded product as CLV.

A vetala ( ') is a revenant in Hindu faith, usually defined as a knowledgeable (fortune telling) paranormal entity said to be dwelling at charnel grounds. The vetala is comparable to the vampires of Western mythology. Reanimated corpses are used as vehicles by the spirits for movement, the corpse no longer decays while it is inhabited by a vetala. A vetala may possess and also leave a dead body at will. Description In Hindu folklore, the vetala is an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses. They make their displeasure known by troubling humans. They can drive people mad, kill children, and cause miscarriages, but also guard villages. They are hostile spirits of the dead trapped in the 'twilight zone' between life and afterlife. These creatures can be repelled by the chanting of mantras. One can free them from their ghostly existence by performing their funerary rites. Being unaffected by the laws of space and time, they have an uncanny knowledge about the past, present, and future and a deep insight into human nature. Therefore many sorcerers seek to capture them and turn them into slaves. There is also a strong Vetala cult in the Konkan region, under the names of Betal, Vetal, etc. Since Shri Betal is said to be the brother of Shri Shantadurga. Therefore, wherever a temple of Shantadurga is, there will be a temple dedicated in honour of Shri Betal either within the temple complex of Shri Shantadurga or somewhere in the sylvan surroundings.. It seems, however, that the relation between the literary Vetala and this demigod's is feeble at best. There is a Shri Betal temple in Amona, Goa. Vet√°l is the worshipper (or sevak) of Kala Bhairava and is the head of all spirits and ghouls and vampires and all kinds of pisachas. He has another form which is a more potent and fiery form, that of Agni Vetal who is the sevak of none other than Kalika. Lord Agnivetal has flames on his head and controls fire. He is also known as Agya Vetal. Agnivetal is used by Tantriks to perform evil black magic on people. But it isn't Lord Agnivetal's fault because the Tantriks misuse the powers given to them on propitiating Agnivetal(rather his Daityas which are at his feet-they are the ones who accept the blood sacrifices). Literature The Baital Pachisi or Vetala Tales is a collection of stories compiled no later than the 11th century. It features a frame story of a sorcerer who asked King Vikramaditya to capture a vetala who lived in a tree that stood in the middle of a cremation ground. The only way to do that was by keeping silent. Every time Vikramaditya caught the vetala, the vetala would enchant the king with a story that would end with a question. No matter how hard he tried, Vikramaditya would not be able to resist answering the question. This would enable the vetala to escape and return to his tree.  In popular culture  Vikram Aur Betaal was a television programme based on the Baital Pachisi produced by Ramanand Sagar and directed by his son Prem Sagar that aired on DD National channel. Non-actual Vetala were also a part of The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel and have appeared in television shows such as Supernatural season 7 episode 11, Adventures in Babysitting, Sleepy Hollow, Jekyll & Hyde, and a web series titled The Vetala released in 2009, written and directed by Damon Vignale. The series reveals a CGI vetala character in the final episode. 2020 Indian zombie horror series Betaal also features a curse of Vetala. The Vetala (Linda Leith Publishing, 2018) is a novel by Canadian author Phillip Ernest. It tells the story of Nada, a professor of Sanskrit, who finds herself face to face with the imaginative vetala, the subject of her life-long study.

K. Textbook of Automatic Pistols, pp.134‚Äì137 Plantersville, SC: Small Arms Technical Publishing Company, 1943. General features This pistol is one of the most simple of blow-back semi- automatic pistols ever designed. The lockwork is essentially that of an elementary single action revolver. While technically listed as a 'hesitation' lock because of a delaying cam which has some theoretical tendency to slow down the opening of the breech, in actual practice it functions as an unlocked pistol. According to the Steyr factory records this arm, patented in 1898, was originally introduced as the \\"Model 1900\\" and used a special 8 mm cartridge. When introduced commercially in 1901 it was chambered for a special straight- case cartridge listed in Austria as \\"7.63 mm Mannlicher\\", designated in Germany as \\"7.65mm Mannlicher\\" (Note: There is also another 7.65 mm Mannlincher cartridge, M.1903, similar to 7.65 mm Borchard), and described in the U.S. as \\"7.65 x 21 mm\\". The Mannlicher \\"straight sided\\" cartridge actually has a straight taper to help in extraction. The cartridge for this pistol was manufactured in Europe until the beginning of WWII. The cartridge has a bullet weighing approx. 85 grains (5.5 g) which may be steel or cupro-nickel jacketed. The powder charge varies with the type of powder used, the European standard being about 3.5 grains (227 mg) of DWM standard powder, producing a muzzle velocity in the neighborhood of 1070 ft/s (326 m/s). While this is a cartridge of considerable power to use in a blow-back action, the pistol design itself is so sturdy that the arm has given satisfaction through the years. The firing chamber in this design is part of the receiver proper. The magazine is housed in the grip and is loaded with a stripper clip through the top of the open action. Because of the extremely simple lock work employed, the pistol has a minimum bulk for an arm of its type. 300px Breechblock design The moving breechblock of this pistol was designed as a slide with two rails extending forward beneath the stationary receiver/barrel where they are connected by a cross beam which is also part of the single breechblock forging. The barrel is screwed into the chamber section of the receiver and has a front sight top rib which is part of the barrel forging. A spiral recoil spring is positioned horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of the receiver and rails of the breechblock. An illustration of this spring is shown in the drawing from page 216, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. When the pistol is discharged, as the breechblock moves to the rear and the slide rails travel back in the receiver guides, the cross- beam at the forward end serves to compress the recoil spring against the frame. 300px The lockwork is incorporated on the left side of the frame where it is covered by a removable side cover housing of unusual design, being wrapped around at the forward end and serving also as a cover of the recoil spring. An illustration of this cover is shown in the drawing from page 218,.Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947 This cover is installed on the frame from the front and is retained by a spring catch forward of the trigger- guard. The trigger is connected on the left side of the frame to a trigger bar which, as the trigger is pulled, moves rearward pushing against the sear tail which is under the control of the V-spring that serves as both trigger and sear springs. The sear nose engages in a notch in the left fork of the hammer (the hammer is external) to provide a fine trigger pull which is very unusual in an automatic pistol. Mounted on the frame under the right portion of the side cover housing is the mainspring, a heavy V-spring. Its greater arm (lower) engages a notch in the right fork of the hammer to drive it forward when released by the sear. Its lesser arm (upper) continuously presses a cam upward that engages a slot in the under surface of the breechblock slide when the action is closed. 300px To load the pistol grasp the breechblock on the serrated gripping surfaces on the sides and pull the machine straight to the rear. The magazine follower rises to hold the action open while the cross beam at the forward end of the slide compresses the recoil spring. Insert a loaded stripper clip into the clip guide in the face of the breech block and then strip the cartridges into the magazine, compressing the spring below the follower. An illustration of this process is shown in the drawing from page 214, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. The spring lip at the top of the magazine serves to hold the cartridges. The cam on the right side of the frame, being forced up by the lesser arm of the mainspring, pushes the cam into the slot in the under surface of the breechblock slide and holds the machine back as explained above. Because of this cam hold-open, the pistol does not close when the clip is removed. However, drawing back slightly on the breechblock will ride it over the cam, and releasing it will permit the recoil spring to close the action. As the breechblock goes forward, the extractor mounted in the top of the block will snap over the extracting groove of the cartridge as it is chambered. Discharging Movement of the trigger linked to the trigger bar releases the sear from the hammer notch. The compressed arm of the mainspring, pushes against the hammer notch, rotating the hammer on its axis to strike the firing pin, discharging the cartridge. The breechblock starts back at the instant of discharge, carrying the empty cartridge case with assistance of the extractor. The empty cartridge case is brought sharply against the ejector which is a bar at the back of the magazine. The underside of the breechblock is slotted to travel over the ejector. The recoiling slide riding over the hammer causes the hammer to rotate on its axis, locking the sear in the notch of the left hammer fork. The magazine spring forces the next cartridge up into line. At the apex of the recoil stroke the recoil spring acts to reverse the direction of the breechblock, chambering a fresh cartridge. Until trigger pressure is released another discharge is not possible. 300px Magazine unload lever A unique feature of this pistol model is the unloading device. While the breechblock is held open, pulling down on the serrated lever on the right side at the top of the grip panel will withdraw the lip which is holding the cartridges in the magazine, enabling the magazine spring to move the platform up and force all the cartridges out of the magazine. 300px Developmental versions After the disappointing reception of the Mannlicher M1894, a more conventional Mannlicher M1896 appeared externally resembling the Mauser C96. The M1896 had a fixed magazine ahead of the trigger holding six or seven cartridges; but most production of this design was an improved M1897/01 using a detachable six-shot magazine in the same location. Both the M1896 and M1897/01 were chambered for the 7.65√ó25mm Mannlicher and could be fed from the top with a stripper clip. Fewer than 1,000 M1896s and M1897/01s were manufactured in several variations including carbines, detachable shoulder stocks, and a trials version tested by the Swiss military. The Mannlicher M1898 was a complete redesign moving the magazine back into the location of the M1901 for loading from an 8-round stripper clip. An M1899 had a large safety lever mounted on the left side of the frame. Embellished pistols were presented to German Kaiser Wilhelm and to Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II; but production of the M1898 and M1899 was less than 350 until the design was improved to the M1901 with a slide-mounted, hammer-blocking safety and convenient lever lock for easier disassembly.

The most notable aspects of the Mandelbrot competition were the difficulty of the problems (much like the American Mathematics Competition and harder American Invitational Mathematics Examination problems) and the proof-based team round. Many past medalists at the International Mathematics Olympiad first tried their skills on the Mandelbrot Competition. History The Mandelbrot Competition was started by Sam Vandervelde, Richard Rusczyk and Sandor Lehoczky while they were undergraduates in the early 1990s. Vandervelde ran the competition until its completion in 2019. Rusczyk now manages Art of Problem Solving Inc. and Lehoczky enjoys a successful career on Wall Street.  Contest format  The individual competition consisted of seven questions of varying value, worth a total of 14 points, that students had 40 minutes to answer. The team competition was a proof-based competition, where many questions were asked about a particular situation, and a team of four students was given 60 minutes to answer.About the Mandelbrot Competition  Divisions  The Mandelbrot Competition had two divisions, referred to as National and Regional. Questions at the National level were more difficult than those at the Regional level, but generally had overlap or concerned similar topics. For example, in the individual competition, the National competition would remove some of the easier Regional questions, and add some harder questions. In the team competition, the topic would be the same but the National level would be given fewer hints.

Behaviour and ecology The southern screamer is a good swimmer, having partially webbed feet, but prefers to move on the ground. The bony spurs on its wings are used for protection against rival screamers and other enemies. Although it is non-migratory, it is an excellent flier. It lives in large flocks, feeding on the ground in grasslands and cultivated fields until nesting season, when birds pair off. Their unfussy diet makes them amenable to domestication and they make excellent guard animals due to their loud screams. =Breeding= The southern screamer establishes monogamous relationships that last its lifetime, estimated to be 15 years. Courtship involves loud calling by both sexes, which can be heard up to two miles away. For the nest the couple makes a big platform of reeds, straws, and other aquatic plants in an inaccessible place near water. The female lays between two and seven white eggs. The couple share incubation, which takes 43 to 46 days. Chicks leave the nest as soon as they hatch, but the parents care for them for several weeks. The fledging period takes 8 to 14 weeks.

It is the story of American Army lieutenant Philip Nolan, who renounces his country during a trial for treason, and is consequently sentenced to spend the rest of his days at sea without so much as a word of news about the United States. Plot summary The protagonist is a young US Army lieutenant, Philip Nolan, who develops a friendship with the visiting Aaron Burr. When Burr is tried for treason (that historically occurred in 1807), Nolan is tried as an accomplice. During his testimony, he bitterly renounces his nation and angrily shouts, \\"I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\\" The judge is completely shocked at that announcement and, on convicting him, icily grants him his wish. Nolan is to spend the rest of his life aboard US Navy warships in exile with no right ever to set foot on US soil again and with explicit orders that no one shall ever again mention his country to him. The sentence is carried out to the letter. For the rest of his life, Nolan is transported from ship to ship, lives out his life as a prisoner on the high seas, and is never allowed back in a home port. Though he is treated according to his former rank, nothing of his country is ever mentioned to him. None of the sailors in whose custody Nolan remains is allowed to speak to him about the US, and his newspapers are censored. Nolan is unrepentant at first, but over the years, he becomes sadder and wiser and desperate for news. One day, as he is being transferred to another ship, he beseeches a young sailor never to make the same mistake that he had: \\"Remember, boy, that behind all these men... behind officers and government, and people even, there is the Country Herself, your Country, and that you belong to her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by her, boy, as you would stand by your mother...!\\" On one such ship, he attends a party in which he dances with a young lady he had once known. He then beseeches her to tell him something, anything, about the US, but she quickly withdraws and no longer speaks to him. Deprived of a homeland, Nolan slowly and painfully learns the true worth of his country. He misses it more than his friends or family, more than art or music or love or nature. Without it, he is nothing. Dying aboard the , he shows his room to an officer, Danforth. It is \\"a little shrine\\" of patriotism. The Stars and Stripes are draped around a picture of George Washington. Over his bed, Nolan has painted a bald eagle, with lightning \\"blazing from his beak\\" and claws grasping the globe. At the foot of his bed is an outdated map of the United States, showing many of its old territories that had, unbeknownst to him, been admitted to statehood. Nolan smiles, \\"Here, you see, I have a country!\\" The dying man asks desperately to be told the news of American history since 1807, and Danforth finally relates to him almost every major event that has happened to the US since his sentence was imposed; the narrator confesses, however, \\"I could not make up my mouth to tell him a word about this infernal rebellion.\\" Nolan then asks him to bring his copy of the Presbyterian Book of Public Prayer and to read the page at which it automatically opens. Here are the words: \\"Most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and bless Thy servant, the President of the United States, and all others in authority.\\" Nolan says, \\"I have repeated those prayers night and morning, it is now fifty-five years.\\" Every day, he had read of the US but only in the form of a prayer to uphold its leaders since the US Navy had neglected to keep that book from him, which is the supreme irony of the story. Nolan asks him to have them bury him in the sea and have a gravestone placed in memory of him at Fort Adams, Mississippi, or at New Orleans. When he dies later that day, he is found to have drafted a suitably patriotic epitaph for himself: \\"In memory of PHILIP NOLAN, Lieutenant in the Army of the United States. He loved his country as no other man has loved her; but no man deserved less at her hands.\\" Effectiveness Hale published \\"The Man Without a Country\\" in the Atlantic Monthly in 1863 to bolster support for the Union in the North.Hall, Timothy L.

It was later collected in 1868 in the book The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales , published by Ticknor and Fields. Danforth's summary to Nolan of American history from 1807 to 1860 is an outline of the Northern case for preservation of the Union. The young country is shown standing up fearlessly to the global superpower, Great Britain; expanding to North America's Pacific coast; developing new contributions to human knowledge such as the Smithsonian Institution; and developing new technology such as steamboats. Hale skillfully convinced many readers that Nolan was an actual figure, thus increasing the story's effectiveness as a piece of patriotic literature. Years later he stated that the story, at least in part, was \\"testimony\\" against the election of 1863, in which Clement Vallandigham (1820‚Äì71), an ardent antiwar, pro- Confederate, anti‚Äì\\"King Lincoln\\" Ohio Democrat, was running for office from exile in Canada, and who, at his own earlier treason trial, like the fictional Nolan, expressed his disgust the United States. By frequently mentioning specific dates and places and by using numerous contemporary references, Hale grounded his story in a firm foundation of history and made the story seem like a record of actual events. In his 1893 and 1900 reminiscences, E. E. Hale stated, \\"To write the story of 'The Man Without a Country' and its sequel, 'Philip Nolan‚Äôs Friends', I had to make as careful a study as I could have the history of the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States.\\"Edward Everett Hale. 1900.

Adaptations \\"The Man Without a Country\\" has been adapted for film several times, starting in 1917 with The Man Without a Country starring Florence La Badie, a 1918 film My Own United States, one in 1925, and another Man Without a Country starring John Litel and Gloria Holden and released by Warner Brothers in 1937.IMDb The Man Without a Country 1917 FilmIMDb My Own United States 1918 FilmIMDb The Man without a Country 1973 TV An opera of the story, also entitled The Man Without a Country, was composed by Walter Damrosch and premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1937. On November 21, 1943, the horror/thriller radio program The Weird Circle presented an adaptation of the story. Bill Johnstone (best known as Orson Welles' replacement as the title character in The Shadow radio drama) narrated (and took part in) the story as Hale. A four-part dramatization was recorded in June 1947 and issued by Decca on two coupled 12\\" 78 rpm discs. Bing Crosby provided the narration, and Frank Lovejoy portrayed Philip Nolan. The Railroad Hour presented a 30-minute adaptation of \\"The Man Without a Country\\" on June 28, 1953. Gordon MacRae and Dorothy Warenskjold starred in the broadcast. In Sam Fuller's film Run of the Arrow (1957), Captain Clark (Brian Keith), a U.S. Army Engineer commissioned to build a fort on Sioux territory, relates the Nolan story to O'Meara (Rod Steiger), a southerner who, refusing to accept the defeat of the Confederacy, has married among the Sioux and been appointed by them to see the fort is built where agreed. In the context of pressing O'Meara to decide whether his loyalties lie ultimately with the Sioux or with the Americans, Clark tells the Nolan story as if it were historical fact. In 1973, a made-for-television movie was written by Sidney Carroll and directed by Delbert Mann. It featured Cliff Robertson as Philip Nolan, Beau Bridges as Frederick Ingham, Peter Strauss as Arthur Danforth, Robert Ryan as Lt. Cmdr. Vaughan, Walter Abel as Col. A.B. Morgan, Geoffrey Holder as one of the slaves on a slave ship, Shepperd Strudwick as the Secretary of the Navy, John Cullum as Aaron Burr, and Patricia Elliott as Mrs. Graff. On May 8, 1977, a three-act radio play was broadcast as an episode of Himan Brown's The General Mills Radio Adventure Theater. Russell Horton performed the part of Nolan. Tom Bosley was host of the series. In 2016, Chuck Pfarrer penned an historical novel entitled Phillip Nolan: The Man Without a Country for the US Naval Institute Press.

Early life and education Chaffee was born in Junction City, Kansas, on September 23, 1884 to his father, Lieutenant General Adna R. Chaffee, and mother, Annie Francis Rockwell. He was commissioned as a Lieutenant of Cavalry in 1906 following his graduation from the United States Military Academy. He was 31st out of 78 pupils in his class. Chaffee learned to ride on horseback from a young age, and would later receive recognition as \\"the Army's finest horseman\\". Upon his father's death in 1914, he became an Hereditary First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Career In World War I, he was an Infantry Major with the IV Corps during the Battle of Saint- Mihiel. As a Colonel, he later served with the III Corps throughout the Meuse- Argonne Offensive. Following the war, he returned to his Regular Army rank of Captain of Cavalry and became an instructor at the General Staff School and the Army School of the Line at Fort Leavenworth. During the 1920s, he helped develop the armor concepts and doctrine of the future. He predicted in 1927 that mechanized armies would dominate the next war and assisted in the first program for the development of a U.S. Army armored force. Assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division in 1931, he continued to develop and experiment with armored forces, thus becoming the leading American advocate of mechanized warfare. In 1938, he assumed command of the reorganized 7th Cavalry Brigade, the Army's only armored force. Chaffee battled continuously during the prewar years for suitable equipment and for establishment of armored divisions. With the collapse of the French Army in June 1940, Chaffee's 1927 predictions of the importance of armored forces in modern warfare were confirmed. Chaffee died of cancer on August 22, 1941, in Boston, Massachusetts. Legacy The M24 Chaffee light tank is named after him. Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, near Fort Smith, Arkansas, is named in his honor.

She was fitted with a spar torpedo instead of an iron ram and was built in 1863‚Äì1864 by the Confederate States Navy at Wilmington, North Carolina. While she was being built her commander was Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN). She was put into commission on April 30, 1864 under the command of Lieutenant J. Pembroke Jones, CSN. Built to chief CSN constructor John L. Porter's similar plans for those of the ironclad , she had been laid down and launched at the foot of Church Street; her fitting-out was completed by the shipyard J. L. Cassidey & Sons. CSS Raleigh was one of two s built for the Confederate Navy at Wilmington during the Civil War. A total of six Richmond-class ironclads were laid down at Richmond, Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah in the spring of 1862. Chief naval constructor John L. Porter had designed these armored steam ships for harbor defense, adapting plans he had originally conceived in 1846, fifteen years before to the war. On April 20, 1864 the newly completed Raleigh steamed down the Cape Fear River and joined her sister ironclad CSS North Carolina, which was already in CSN service at Smithville. Raleigh drew of water, less than the by then leaking and waterlogged North Carolina (North Carolinas green hull timbers had become infested with sea worms, a condition that eventually caused her to founder). Flag Officer William F. Lynch quickly decided to take his new ironclad over the bar at New Inlet, North Carolina and attack the Union blockading squadron at sea. On May 6 Raleigh emerged from the Cape Fear River and stood out to the Atlantic, accompanied by CSS Yadkin and CSS Equator, where she engaged six Federal blockaders, including and , off New Inlet. The plan was ill-conceived, as the Richmond-class ironclads, being designed for harbor defense and calm water, were not seaworthy. Nonetheless, the officers and men of Raleigh prepared their ship for battle. The engagement that followed was shrouded in darkness and marked by confusion. Raleigh, because of her slow speed on open sea, was unable to close with the Federals. Flares and cannon fire alerted the rest of the blockading squadron, but most commanders, unaware of the ironclad's presence, assumed a blockade runner had been cornered. For the rest of the night, Raleigh steamed blindly through the blockading squadron, unnoticed. At daybreak, the ironclad returned to New Inlet and crossed the bar at 7:15 a.m. The \\"battle,\\" as such, was over, neither side sustaining serious damage or gaining advantage. After entering Cape Fear, Raleigh turned south, but soon ran hard aground on a bar known as \\"the Rip\\". As the tide went out, the now unsupported weight of the ironclad's armored casemate, cannon, and machinery bore down heavily on the aft section of her keel. Unable to sustain the added weight pressure, Raleigh \\"broke her back\\", resulting in a total loss of the new ironclad after serving just one week in the Confederate Navy. Salvage crews reclaimed her iron plating, both her Brooke rifles, both smoothbore cannon, and shipped her boilers to , then being repaired at Columbus, Georgia. In 1994 the wreck was investigated by the North Carolina State Underwater Archaeology Unit with help from students of East Carolina University.

This 1000-year-old Roman Catholic cathedral is the site of the episcopal see of the Bishop of Mainz. Mainz Cathedral is predominantly Romanesque in style, but later exterior additions over many centuries have resulted in the appearance of various architectural influences seen today. It comprises three naves and stands under the patronage of Saint Martin of Tours. The eastern quire is dedicated to Saint Stephen. The interior of the cathedral houses tombs and funerary monuments of former powerful Electoral-prince- archbishops, or ', of the diocese and contains religious works of art spanning a millennium. The cathedral also has a central courtyard and statues of Saint Boniface and The Madonna on its grounds. Mainz Cathedral ca. 1855During the time of Mainz Archbishop Willigis (975-1011), the city of Mainz flourished economically, and Willigis became one of the most influential politicians of that time, ascending to regent of the empire between 991 and 994. In 975-976 shortly after his installation he ordered the construction of a new cathedral in the pre-Romanesque Ottonian architecture style. This new and impressive building was part of his vision of Mainz as the \\"second Rome\\". page 138 This new cathedral was to take over the functions of two churches: the old cathedral and St. Alban's, which was the largest church in the area, belonging to a Benedictine abbey and serving as the burial ground for the bishops and other nobles, including Fastrada, a spouse of Charlemagne. Most of the synods and other important meetings were held at St. Alban's Abbey. The new cathedral consisted of a double chancel with two transepts. The main hall was built in the typical triple-nave \\"cross\\" pattern. As was usual at that time no vault was included because of structural difficulties relating to the size of the building. Six towers rose from the church. A cloister was enclosed in the structure and a small freestanding church, St. Mary's Church, connected by a colonnade. This small church developed later into the collegiate church of St. Maria ad Gradus. Present-day floor plan of the cathedral (‚ÜëS)Sandstone was used as the primary building material for the cathedral. The inside was plastered white under the Archbishop Bardo, probably in the middle of the 10th century. During renovations ordered by Henry IV in the late 11th century, much of the outside was also plastered, but the cornices were left exposed in their original red and yellow. It is believed that the coloring of the cathedral was changed more times, but no further documentation of the coloring is available until record of the Baroque works. South nave The cathedral suffered extensive damage from a fire on the day of its inauguration in 1009. Archbishop Bardo (Bardo of Oppershofen) presided over the completion of the cathedral begun under Willigis. By 1037 the main portions of the body of Mainz Cathedral were complete. Willigis was buried in the second church he had initiated, St. Stephan's, in 1011. The two chancels The reason for building two chancels is not entirely clear. Many scholars suggest that there is some symbolic significance, such as empire and church, or body and spirit, but no irrefutable evidence for these theories exists. Others claim that the construction has a functional purpose for ceremonial processions. Whatever the original intent of the double chancel, the eastern chancel came to serve as the location for the mass and the western chancel was reserved for the bishop and pontiffs. =Bardo's western chancel= In most cathedrals at the time, the main chancel lay on the east side. Willigis, however, designed his cathedral with the main chancel on the west, presumably modeled after the great basilicas in Rome, which were constructed this way. (Willigis's design bore a striking resemblance to Old St. Peter's Basilica.) The chancel was badly damaged in the fire of 1009, and remained that way under Archbishops Erkanbald and Aribo. The chancel was finally reconstructed under Bardo. He then buried his predecessor Aribo there, before the rest of the cathedral was even finished. (Willigis's remains are not, as sometimes believed, in Mainz Cathedral; he was buried in his second construction project, St. Stephen's). =Henry IV's eastern chancel= In 1081, fire once again struck the cathedral, and the appearance of the Salian western end is not known. In 1100, Henry IV ordered reconstruction in the old Lombardic style. The old flat chancel end on the east side was replaced with a large apse, which external gallery with a narrow arcade supported by short columns crowned the semicircular wall with a wide pseudo arcade and tall pilasters on both sides. The new chancel had a triple-nave crypt. The damaged square tower had been replaced with an octagonal dome, above which an octagonal tower was added later. Flanking stair turrets remained from the first cathedral. These changes closely resembled the renovations Henry had overseen on Speyer Cathedral a few years earlier. Henry also undertook a few other minor changes, such as raising the transept on the east side and adding openings at the column level. These column-level portals were among the first ever such constructed. Henry died in 1106, before his intended changes were complete. With his death, the funding for the renovation of the cathedral dried up and so the remaining construction was abandoned. Mainz Cathedral is considered one of the three Kaiserdome (\\"Emperor's Cathedrals\\") of the Holy Roman (German) Empire, along with Worms Cathedral and Speyer Cathedral. =Evolution of the main nave= The main nave of the cathedral Archbishop Adalbert I of Saarbr√ºcken (1110‚Äì1137) had a two- story chapel, called the Gotthard Chapel, built as the official palace chapel next to the cathedral. It is believed that he also ordered the renovation of the main body of the cathedral, mainly due to similarities between the main hall and the vault of the new chapel. Conception for the renovations was again taken from the Romanesque Speyer Cathedral. This time, however, without money from the emperor, the builders lacked the resources to acquire the high- quality sandstone used in Henry's additions. They instead used limestone. The other aspects of the renovations were also much cheaper, and the extravagant style of Speyer Cathedral was largely avoided. The central nave was built to an impressive 28 meters, five meters short of Speyer Cathedral's 33. It seems that the blind arches were intended to encompass the windows, as in Speyer Cathedral, but the height of the roof did not allow this. The resulting three- level effect, due to the arches ending before the windows, was a technique not before seen in architecture. The main hall was further renovated throughout the entire 12th century. The entire outer wall structure was eventually replaced. Around the year 1200, the ceiling was replaced with a ribbed vault, a rather new technique for the time. =Additional renovations= Around the time that the ribbed vault was installed it was decided to renovate the western half of the cathedral, which had stayed relatively unchanged since Willigis' construction. In contrast to the eastern renovations done earlier, which were in a high-Romanesque style, these new changes were carried out in a late Romanesque style. A new vault was added to span the north and south arms of the transept. Large windows were added to the wall separating the transept from the main hall. The large dome connecting the transept to the main hall was decorated with friezes and pillars. Three small apses and two very large pillars were added to support the small flank towers. Pediments were added to the three open sides of the chancel. In general, the western section of the cathedral was extensively decorated to keep up with the newly renovated eastern section. Post-Romanesque building and renovation Already at the time of renovations on the western segment of the cathedral, new architectural styles were being ushered in. This included Gothic additions and, later, Baroque pieces as well. =Gothic additions= The first post-Romanesque addition to the cathedral was the western rood screen. This was done in the Gothic style at the time of the western renovations. Following this example, the intersect area was heavily renovated in the next few centuries in the Gothic style. A Gothic window in the cathedral Starting in 1279, Gothic chapels featuring large decorative windows were built onto the cathedral. In 1418 the Nassauer Chapel, a freestanding burial chapel in the middle nave was built at the request of Archbishop John II of Nassau. The construction of this chapel is attributed to Madern Gerthener, who was also responsible for the Memorial Chapel built into the entrance hall to the western wing of the intersect area. The towers were also renovated during this period. Belfries were added to the two towers at the crossings, on the eastern tower in 1361 and on the western in 1418. These towers were topped with Gothic-style pyramid roofs. (These towers turned out to be so heavy that the eastern tower had to be supported by a pillar erected in 1430.) The cloister was heavily renovated and the Liebfrauenkirche was completely replaced at this time, marking the last of the Gothic renovations to the building. The roof on the eastern tower, however, was replaced in 1579 by a flatter one due to weight concerns. After that, no major alterations were made to the cathedral for almost two centuries. =Baroque additions= Mainz Cathedral (around 1840) In 1767 the western cross-tower was struck by lightning and its roof was destroyed. In 1769 the engineer Franz Ignaz Michael Neumann designed a new multi-story roof for the tower. All the towers in the western wing were roofed with this new Baroque stone design, although care was taken to preserve the previous styles as well. The pinnacles of the pediments on the chapels were replaced with urn- like structures. The famed weathervane, called the Domsgickel, was added at this time as well. The inside of the cathedral was heavily whitewashed. A statue of St. Martin and the Beggar was erected on the roof of the western chancel in 1769. =19th-century reconstruction= The pulpit in Mainz cathedral The Archbishopric of Mainz suffered heavily in the late 18th century. Following the invasion by French revolutionary troops in 1792, Mainz came under attack from Prussian troops in 1793 in the siege that led to the end of the Republic of Mainz. This attack damaged large portions of the cathedral, particularly the east wing, the cloister, and the Liebfrauenkirche, which was demolished in 1803 (the year after Mainz lost its archbishopric and became a regular diocese). The cathedral was used as an army camp for several years, and therefore large amounts of the cathedral's artefacts were sold, the wooden interior was burned for heat. Bishop Joseph Ludwig Colmar (1802‚Äì1818), with support from Napoleon, set into motion restoration efforts. These efforts were interrupted by quartering needs for the French Army in 1813, and the cathedral was used as a church in 1814 for the first time in eleven years. By 1831, the reparations had been for the most part completed. The major change to the building was an iron cupola on the main eastern tower built by architect Georg Moller. But this cupola was removed in 1870 because it was too heavy. After that, Pierre Cuypers undertook a lengthy restoration work. The support pillar in the eastern cross-tower was removed, as the heavy belfry no longer stood. The crypt in the eastern chancel was rebuilt, but not to the original specifications of the one built by Henry IV. At the conclusion of these reconstructions, a neo-Romanesque tower was erected in place of the eastern cross-tower in 1875. At this time the cathedral was once again repainted. Large and colorful Nazarene movement murals, including some by Philipp Veit, were painted to decorate the inside of the cathedral. =20th century restorations= On-site findings of the excavation until 1912. The plan shows the position of the foundation around the underground ‚ÄúHouse of Nassau‚Äù burial chapel: cross-section and floor plan. The plan had been drawn by the architect of Mainz cathedral Ludwig Becker (architect)Ludwig Becker (1855‚Äì1940) Conservation efforts began in the 1900s to save the cathedral from further damage. The correction of the Rhine river resulted in a lowering of the groundwater, the wooden substructures became rotten and the foundations started to fail and needed to be replaced. Beginning in 1909 the old foundations were underpinned. Works stopped in 1916 due to World War I. Between 1924 and 1928 the fundaments were completely reinforced by a new fundament made of concrete. Concrete and steel were used to anchor the towers and main vault. The cloister in Mainz Cathedral A new floor, made of red marble, was constructed in this period. Architect Paul Meyer-Speer engineered a system to modify the inner walls with colorful sandstone, removing most of the paintings by Veit and restoring a look similar to the original Willigis- Bardo construction. Unfortunately this system did not withstand continuing restoration efforts, and by 1959 most of the color was gone. In World War II, Mainz was a target of Allied bombing multiple times. The cathedral was hit several times in August 1942. Most of the roofs burned, and the top level of the cloister was destroyed. The vault, however, withstood the attacks and remained intact. The damaged elements were restored as authentically as possible, a process which continued well into the 1970s. In addition, much of the glass in the cathedral was replaced. The outside of the cathedral was colored red to match the historical buildings of Mainz. In addition, extensive cleaning and restoration efforts were undertaken, ending in 1975. In that year, the thousandth year since the beginning of the cathedral's construction was celebrated. In 2001, new efforts were begun to restore the cathedral both inside and outside. They were expected to take from ten to fifteen years. In 2004, two large windows, by the renowned glass artist Johannes Schreiter, were installed. Emperors and the cathedral When Mainz was an archbishopric, the cathedral was the official seat of the archdiocese. In 1184 Emperor Barbarossa celebrated the accolade of his sons in the cathedral. The feast of 1184 on the Maaraue, the Diet of Pentecost, became legendary in history as the greatest feast of the Middle Ages. It was from this cathedral that Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor of the time, officially announced his support for the Third Crusade during the Curia Christi of 27 March 1188.The emperors and the pillars of their power From Charlemagne to Frederick Barbarossa, flyer General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland- Palatinate, Landesmuseum Mainz for the Grand State Exhibition 2020 During the Middle Ages, the right to crown German kings (and queens) was given to the Archbishop of Mainz. The crowning in Mainz awarded the monarch the kingdom of Germany, and a subsequent in Rome granted him the Holy Roman Empire (a nominal difference only). Because the cathedral was damaged several times, many crownings were not held there.

It was writer Michael Sussman's third episode of the season, while it was director David Livingston's second. The episode was the third in a three-part story arc, following on from the episodes \\"The Forge\\" and \\"Awakening\\". \\"Kir'Shara\\" and the Vulcan arc showed themes relating to the Protestant Reformation resulting in comparisons to books such as The Da Vinci Code and The Celestine Prophecy, while the Kir'Shara itself was compared to the Nag Hammadi library. Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, Enterprise attempts to avert a war, and is caught in a crossfire between Vulcan and Andorian starships. Meanwhile. Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau aim to take the Kir'Shara to the Vulcan capital, and use it to reveal Administrator V'Las' plot to the rest of the Vulcan High Command. In addition to the guest stars returning from the previous arc episodes, or the episode \\"Home\\", Jeffrey Combs returned as Shran. The episode was shot across seven days using mostly standing sets, with only an Andorian brig built specifically for this episode. \\"Kir'Shara\\" also saw the return of the Vulcan lirpa, a weapon which had been first introduced in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Amok Time\\". The episode originally aired on December 3, 2004 on UPN. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.1/4 percent, which equalled the highest ratings seen during the fourth season. It was warmly received by critics who praised Combs' performance and noted that this episode was an indication of the improving quality of the series. However, there was mixed opinion regarding the ending of the episode. Plot Enterprise heads to Andoria after Ambassador Soval informs them that the Vulcans believe they have been developing Xindi weapon technology. Soval guides Enterprise to a nebula where the Andorian fleet is hiding. Commander Shran is dubious, and abducts and tortures Soval. After believing him, Enterprise joins a fleet of six Andorian ships to intercept the Vulcans. Commander Tucker attempts to buy time by ordering Enterprise directly between the two fleets ‚Äî this works for a while until Administrator V'Las orders them to be targeted too. Meanwhile, at The Forge, Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau, having found the sacred Kir'Shara (which the Syrrannites believe will usher a Vulcan enlightenment), endeavor to take it to the capital. En route, T'Pol and T'Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T'Pau offers to mind-meld with T'Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome is merely the by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination. She is then taken to the capital. Archer and T'Pau also arrive after T'Pol's husband, Koss, provides transporter security codes. They present the Kir'Shara to the Command and reveal that the embassy bombing was merely a pretext to weaken the pacifist Syrrannites prior to the Andorian strike. Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds is only a matter of time. Production Like \\"Home\\", \\"Kir'Shara\\" was written by Michael Sussman and was his third script during the fourth season. David Livingston directed the episode, which was his second episode of the season having previously directed \\"Borderland\\". Most of the guest stars had appeared in the previous episode \\"Awakening\\", including Robert Foxworth as Administrator V'Las, Kara Zediker as T'Pau and John Rubinstein as Kuvak. In addition, Michael Reilly Burke resumes his role as Koss for the third time, having appeared in the role both in \\"Home\\" and \\"The Forge\\". Also appearing, having appeared in \\"Home\\", was Jack Donner as a Vulcan priest. Donner appeared in The Original Series episode \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" as the Romulan Commander Subcommander Tal. \\"Kir'Shara\\" also saw the return of Jeffrey Combs as the Andorian Commander Shran for the sixth time as well as Gary Graham as Ambassador Soval, who has appeared as a recurring character in Enterprise since the pilot episode \\"Broken Bow\\". Filming began on October 4, 2004 and continued until October 12. Despite the desert locations, all filming took place on soundstages. These represented a variety of places throughout the Vulcan desert-like Forge. The remaining sets used were either standing sets, or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes. The exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board Commander Shran's Andorian vessel. The Andorian bridge set, which had been used previously in the series, had a single wall brought out of storage in order to appear as a backdrop for Shran when he appears on the Enterprise viewscreen. The Andorian brig was built specifically for this episode for scenes with Shran and Soval. Re-appearing in \\"Kir'Shara\\" were the traditional Vulcan weapon, the lirpa, which was first introduced in The Original Series episode \\"Amok Time\\". The lirpa is a long shaft with a crescent blade on one end and a spiked cudgel on the other. Brand new props were built for this episode, modifying the original design by making them more lightweight. They were wielded in \\"Kir'Shara\\" by Vulcan commandos, who were all played by stunt actors in non-speaking roles. Additional stunt doubles were required for Archer, T'Pol, T'Pau and Talok while two puppeteers were needed for the Andorian antennae seen on screen. Themes \\"Kir'Shara\\" followed up the events of the previous two episodes in the story arc as well some of the elements seen earlier in the season in the episode \\"Home\\". \\"The Forge\\" sees Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) travel into the Vulcan desert known as the Forge in order to find a renegade faction of Vulcans, known as the Syrrannites. During the journey, Archer has the katra of Surak transferred into him. In \\"Awakening\\", the duo meet the Syrrannites and find out they are peaceful. After Enterprise leaves orbit, the Vulcans start bombarding the caves where the Syrrannites are located, killing T'Pol's mother, T'Les (Joanna Cassidy). Speaking about \\"Awakening\\", show runner Manny Coto had previously said that he envisaged the story arc to be about a Vulcan reformation as a metaphor to the real-world 16th century Protestant Reformation with T'Pau playing the role of Martin Luther. This view was supported by the 2010 book Star Trek As Myth, which saw the original Vulcan religion prior to the Reformation arc seen from \\"The Forge\\" onwards as equating to the Catholic Church while the Syrannites were the Protestants.Kapell (2010): p. 173 In doing so, Administrator V'Las is therefore linked to the Antichrist in much the same way that the Protestant Reformation saw the Pope as the Antichrist. In this role, the Romulans in the story take the place of the subversive devils to form an unholy alliance.Kapell (2010): p. 174 It was also suggested that the Kir'Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library,Kapell (2010): p. 172 which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara in a similar manner to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy. Reception \\"Kir'Shara\\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on December 3, 2004. The broadcast saw the episode come in fourth place during the timeslot, with a Nielsen rating of 2.1/4 percent. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all those watching television at the time of broadcast. It gained higher ratings than The WB, who aired What I Like About You and Grounded for Life. The ratings equalled the highest ratings of the season so far, which were previously achieved by \\"Borderland\\", \\"Cold Station 12\\" and \\"The Augments\\". TV Guide listed \\"Kir'Shara\\" on its Hot List for the day, while the preview by IGN said that the show \\"finally grows up and becomes a Star Trek series this week\\". It described \\"Kir'Shara\\" as \\"far from a perfectly executed Trek story but they get enough right to make it a lot easier to overlook the few things they miss.\\" It said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that \\"this could become some of the best Star Trek ever made\\". It gave \\"Kir'Shara\\" a rating of four and a half out of five. In Matthew Kappell's book Star Trek As Myth, he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along \\"suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy\\" and linked to The Next Generation episode \\"Unification\\".Kapell (2010): p. 175 Herc, in his review for Ain't It Cool News, praised the reliability of Jeffrey Combs as Shran, but thought that there were no major surprises. Herc did say that the biggest shock was the revelation that the Romulans were behind the bombing of the Human Embassy. He gave it a rating of three out of five. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, calling it an \\"absolutely gripping episode\\" except for the \\"ludicrousness of the ending\\". She made the admission about the ending that, \\"I suppose the Romulans had to show up at some point, I guess Vulcan is as good a place as any.\\" She thought that the torture scenes were \\"pointless\\", but was pleased with the characterisation seen in Archer, T'Pol and Tucker. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \\"Jammer's Reviews\\" said that the episode was \\"not perfect, but good\\" with an \\"intriguing\\" ending. He also praised Jeffrey Combs as Shran, and thought that the torture scenes were potent but that the ending was rushed. He gave the episode a rating of three out of four. In 2018, Screen Rant praised casting actress Kara Zediker as the Vulcan character T'Pau.  Home media release  The first home media release of \\"Kir'Shara\\" was in the season four DVD box set of Enterprise, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.

The case represented a major expansion in the Court's interpretation of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause and effectively spelled the end to the Court's striking down of New Deal economic legislation. The case arose after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered Jones & Laughlin Steel to rehire workers who had been fired for seeking to unionize. Jones and Laughlin refused to comply on the grounds that the Wagner Act, which had established the NLRB, was unconstitutional. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act, holding that Congress could regulate economic activities that were \\"intrastate in character when separately considered\\" if they held \\"such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions.\\" In his dissent, Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds argued that Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce should be limited to cases in which a violation is \\"direct and material.\\" Background Jones & Laughlin Steel, the fourth largest steel producer in the United States, was charged with discriminating against workers who wanted to join the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). The company had fired ten employees at its plant in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after they moved to unionize. The NLRB ruled against the company and ordered that the workers be rehired and given back pay, but Jones & Laughlin refused to comply on the grounds and believed the Act to be unconstitutional. Citing Supreme Court precedent, lower courts agreed. Decision Senator Robert F. Wagner was happy over the Supreme Court decision Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote the majority opinion in the case, which reversed the lower court's ruling, in a 5-4 decision: Justice McReynolds dissented, questioning Congress's enhanced power under the commerce clause. Although he did not dispute Congress's regulation of interstate commerce between the states, he stated that Congress's interference should be in cases where a violation is \\"direct and material.\\" McReynolds stated that taxation on property, for example, may indirectly but seriously affect the cost of transportation. He concluded that Congress had transcended the power granted to it by the Constitution.

T.\\" Rybak Jr. (born November 12, 1955) is an American politician, journalist, businessperson, and activist who served as the 46th mayor of Minneapolis. In the 2001 election Rybak defeated incumbent Sharon Sayles Belton by a margin of 65% to 35%, the widest margin of victory over an incumbent mayor in city history. He took office in January 2002, and won a second term in 2005 and a third in 2009. In late December 2012, he announced he would not run for another term and was going to be concentrating on his family. Rybak called being mayor his \\"dream job.\\" Before being elected mayor, Rybak worked in journalism, business and activism. The first mayor of a major U.S. city to endorse Barack Obama's 2008 campaign for president, Rybak was one of five Vice Chairs of the Democratic National Committee. Background Rybak grew up in Minneapolis, the son of Lorraine Ann (n√©e Palmer) and Raymond Thomas Rybak, a pharmacist.http://www.appletree.com/people/name/Raymond_Rybak He is partly of Czech descent.http://www.minnesotabrown.com/2009/12/rt-rybak- minnesotabrown-interview.html He graduated from Breck School in 1974 and from Boston College in 1978. After returning to Minneapolis, in the 1970s and '80s Rybak worked as a journalist for the Minneapolis Tribune. He became managing editor of the Twin Cities Reader, where he also launched Q Monthly, a local gay and lesbian newspaper. For a few years, he headed Internet Broadcasting Systems, which started as an online division of Minneapolis television station WCCO and runs websites for many stations across the United States. Rybak did consulting work as an Internet strategist, and assisted with some projects with Minnesota Public Radio and Public Radio International. He also acted as Development Director for Minneapolis's Downtown Council. During this time, Rybak worked as a community and political activist. In 1994, he was campaign manager for Tony Bouza, the former Minneapolis chief of police who unsuccessfully sought the DFL nomination for Governor of Minnesota. Rybak was an early member of the group ROAR (\\"Residents Opposed to Airport Racket\\"), which campaigned for noise mitigation projects in neighborhoods around the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport. The group staged a memorable \\"pajama protest,\\" where area residents wore their nighttime clothes at the airport to show that they were losing sleep because of airplane noise. Rybak serves on the Board of Directors of Nice Ride Minnesota, a public bicycle sharing program. Mayoralty Rybak crowd surfing in a Minneapolis parade In 2001 Rybak defeated incumbent Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, receiving 57,739 votes (64.7%) to her 30,896 (34.6%). Rybak's mayoralty focused mostly on reducing crime, creating jobs, building affordable housing, and balancing the city budget. He regularly attended public events and participated directly in discussions of city issues on his Facebook page. He notably crowd-surfed while mayor, diving from the stage during a \\"Rock for Democracy\\" event at the Minneapolis club First Avenue in July 2004. In 2002, Rybak developed the City of Lakes Loppet, a 35-kilometer urban cross-country ski race through Theodore Wirth Park and across Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles and Lake Calhoun, which ends on the streets of the Uptown Minneapolis. The event attracts nearly 2,000 skiers. Rybak is a skier and has participated in races. Rybak made many public appearances at rallies and protests. In April 2004 he spoke to a rally of striking Metro Transit workers at the Hennepin County Government Center plaza. Like many Twin Cities politicians, he marched in the annual Twin Cities Pride Parade. In his 2005 reelection campaign Rybak defeated challenger (and fellow DFLer) Peter McLaughlin by nearly 25 percentage points, 61.5% to 36.7%. He celebrated with another crowd-surf.Aaron Landry ¬ª R.T. Rybak at the Ukrainian Event Center Rybak at the site of the bridge collapse In August 2007, after the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, Rybak asked Governor Tim Pawlenty and Minnesota state officials to implement its replacement, ensuring that the new bridge would be capable of handling mass transit. Rybak pushed to ensure that future needs and policy considerations would not be ignored in the rush to build a replacement. The resulting plan accommodated a light rail line. Rybak said, \\"we (the City) have a vision that we believe will be for a bridge that will serve us for many years to come.\\" His role also involved authorizing municipal consent of the final bridge replacement. Rybak was listed as a finalist for the 2008 World Mayor award. Retrieved on January 19, 2009. In June 2008 Rybak was elected Vice President for Communications of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors. Retrieved on January 19, 2009. According to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Rybak was the first mayor of a large U.S. city to endorse Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2007. Rybak campaigned for Obama and was active in the campaign's youth wing. In January 2009, Rybak announced his intention to run for reelection to a third term. In March 2009, Rybak proposed eliminating the Minneapolis Civil Rights Investigations Division, which was established in 1967 to investigate discriminatory practices as part of the city's Civil Rights Department. The plan was met by community opposition, with both the DFL African American Caucus and the Minneapolis Urban League speaking out against it. During his tenure as mayor, Rybak went through six civil rights directors and decreased the number of workers in the department. On November 3, 2009, Rybak was elected to a third term, winning more than 73.6% of the first-place votes. Rybak's office regularly used social media, often to alert followers to vital city information. He used Twitter too. Rybak chose not to run for a fourth term. His mayoralty ended on January 2, 2014, when Betsy Hodges was sworn in as the city's 47th mayor. After leaving office, Rybak became Executive Director of Generation Next, an organization seeking to help close the achievement gap for minority students. He is now President and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation. 2010 gubernatorial campaign Rybak ending his campaign for governor of Minnesota On November 5, 2009, Rybak filed paperwork creating a campaign for governor of Minnesota. A month later, he officially announced his candidacy at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis. Rybak won the straw poll on February 2, 2010, at Minnesota's precinct caucus events statewide. On April 24, 2010, Rybak withdrew his name from consideration for the nomination at the DFL convention after six ballots. He endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher, and called on Democrats remaining in the race to withdraw and support her. Former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton subsequently won the Democratic nomination and the general election that year. Other work Living Cities, a philanthropic collaborative of 22 foundations and financial institutions, reported that Rybak was hired in May 2014 as a senior advisor for municipal practice. Living Cities members include Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley. In September 2011, Rybak became vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Personal life Rybak's star on the outside mural of Minneapolis nightclub First AvenueRybak lives in the city's East Harriet neighborhood with his wife, Megan, and their children, Charlie and Grace. Like their father, the Rybak children have attended Breck School, an Episcopal private school. Rybak's mother worked there during a difficult period in his childhood. Rybak was awarded Breck's Distinguished Alumnus award in 2002, and spoke at the school's commencement ceremony in 2015. On January 4, 2014, Rybak was cross-country skiing when he started experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath. He was hospitalized and received an angioplasty and stents after it was determined he had had a heart attack. Heart problems run in his family. Rybak has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue. The mural recognizes performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Rybak is one of the few non-musicians to have a star on the mural. Further reading * Art Hughes (October 23, 2001). Campaign Profile: R. T. Rybak. Minnesota Public Radio.

Her album Geek the Girl (1994) was chosen a top album of the 1990s by Spin magazine. She began her career as a violinist for John Mellencamp. As of 2018 she has released thirteen albums.\\" Alumni return for South Bend Youth Symphony's gala 50th anniversary concert at Notre Dame\\". By Andrew S. Hughes South Bend Tribune May 20, 2018 Early life Germano was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, one of five children of violinist Rocco and Betty Germano. She studied music, including piano and violin, as a child. When she was seven, she composed a fifteen-minute opera for the piano. Career =On the road with Mellencamp= Germano was working as a violinist when rock singer John Mellencamp invited her to play on his album. For seven years she toured and recorded as a member of Mellencamp's band, appearing on The Lonesome Jubilee (1987), Big Daddy (1989), Falling from Grace (1991), Human Wheels (1993), and Dance Naked (1994). During the 1980s she also appeared on albums by Simple Minds and the Indigo Girls. =Solo career= After recording with Henry Lee Summer, Bob Seger, and Carrie Newcomer, Germano began a solo career with the album On the Way Down from the Moon Palace (1991), recorded in Indianapolis and released by her label, Major Bill Records. Although sales were low, the album got the attention of Capitol Records, which signed her to a contract and released her next album Happiness (1993). Personnel changes at Capitol resulted in the departure of most of her benefactors, but she retained the rights to her album. =Working for a British label= She signed a contract with the British label 4AD, which had a manufacturing and distribution deal with Warner Bros. in the U.S. Ivo Watts- Russell, founder and president of 4AD, was a fan of Germano's work. He remixed some of the tracks from Happiness with producer and engineer John Fryer, who had been involved in Watts-Russell's This Mortal Coil project. In early 1994, 4AD issued Inconsiderate Bitch, a limited-edition EP which contained five of the remixed tracks. In April of that year Happiness was reissued with different artwork, mixing, sequencing. Two tracks, including a cover version of \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\", were replaced. Germano's album Geek the Girl (1994) was reviewed positively by the press and was a noted album of the 1990s. Much attention was given to the track \\"...A Psychopath\\", which contains audio from a 9-1-1 emergency phone call by a woman who was being terrorized by an intruder in her home. In 1995, Germano contributed the song \\"The Mirror Is Gone\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. Excerpts From a Love Circus (1996) was praised by Spin and Rolling Stone. Earlier that year, Watts-Russell approached 4AD's musicians with the idea that each act would find another person or band to collaborate with on three songs. The recordings would then be released by the label as a monthly series of EPs. Germano worked with rock band Giant Sand, but after their tracks had been recorded, the label decided that the series would be unfeasible and rejected the idea. Germano and the members of Giant Sand liked the results and enjoyed collaborating, and despite the labels' lack of interest in the recordings, recorded an album in less than a week. Managers for Germano and Giant Sand made a deal with Thirsty Ear Recordings to release the album as a one-off project under the name OP8, and the album Slush was released in February 1997. In April 1997, 4AD began promoting \\"I Love a Snot\\" (remixed by Tchad Blake) to radio and retail stores in America, but sales of the album remained static at best. \\"Lovesick\\" from Excerpts from a Love Circus was remixed by Trevor Jackson (a.k.a. The Underdog), and released by his label, Output Recordings. Sales began to sag noticeably with the release of Slide, produced by Tchad Blake, in July 1998. The distribution deal with Warner Bros. ended, returning 4AD to independent status, and without Warner Bros. Slide received less promotion. Before the album was released she was invited to sing backup vocals on tour for The Smashing Pumpkins. Although she rejected the offer at first, singer Billy Corgan persuaded her that she would have a more collaborative role, and she agreed to join the tour. She rehearsed with the band for four weeks in Chicago. The night before the tour was supposed to begin, Corgan dismissed her (via the tour manager) with no explanation. Intent on resuming the promotion of Slide, she went tour, opening for Eels and then headlining smaller clubs. While on tour she was notified by 4AD that they were dropping her from the label. By the end of 1998, she announced that she was done with the music business. She fired her management. Nonetheless, in 1999 she performed in Toronto at Lee's Palace.\\"Live Reviews: Latin Playboys/Lisa Germano April 21, 1999 Lee's Palace, Toronto\\".

Songwriting remained part of her life, and she collaborated with Yann Tiersen, David Bowie, Neil Finn, and Joey Waronker. In 2002 she released two compilations of songs from her back catalog. Concentrated is a selection of \\"greatest hits\\" with a few oddities, such as the Underdog remix of \\"Lovesick\\". Rare, Unusual or Just Bad Songs is composed of rarities, such as \\"Breathe Acrost Texas\\" which was omitted from the reissue of Happiness, and tracks that were previously unavailable. Each copy came with an insert painted by Germano. Later that year, she began gathering songs she had been writing and recording mostly by herself at home during the previous two years. She sent CDs of these tracks to labels and friends in the music industry. The first to respond was a longtime acquaintance, producer and label executive Tony Berg. After the relative success of the ARTISTdirect websites, CEO Marc Geiger started Ineffable Records with Berg in 2002. Germano was the first act signed to the label's roster. Lullaby for Liquid Pig was released in 2003 with help from guitarist Johnny Marr (of The Smiths and Modest Mouse), Neil Finn, and Wendy Melvoin. The album met with critical acclaim, but the label shut down. Three years later she was invited by Michael Gira of the band Swans to join his label, Young God Records. The label released the album In the Maybe World (2006) and reissued Lullaby for Liquid Pig (2007) with a bonus disc of unreleased live recordings and demos. In 2012, Germano was the violinist on two national tours by Tammy Lang, the Chelsea Madchen tour in which the singer parodied Nico of Velvet Underground and her outing as a subversive country- and-western alter ego Tammy Faye Starlite. Drummer Pete Thomas played on both tours, as did guitarist Peter \\"Petey\\" Andrews. The band \\"played some of the best blues rock music I've heard in years,\\" wrote Huffington Post music correspondent Wendy Block.

It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon and originally aired on UPN on May 20, 2003. The Buffy story would not be continued beyond this point until \\"The Long Way Home\\", a comic book, in 2007 and the Buffy and Angel saga would end in the Season Twelve series in late 2018. Plot A bloody Caleb rises and Buffy finally kills him with the scythe by slicing him in two from the crotch up. Angel has brought an amulet intended to be worn by someone ensouled, yet more than human. He tells her he will fight alongside her, but she turns him down, asking him to instead organize a second front in case she loses to The First. They discuss Spike, his soul, and Buffy's feelings for him, with Angel clearly unsettled and jealous. When Angel asks whether he has a place in her future, Buffy explains that she still needs to grow up; there might be a future for them, but it will be a long time coming, if ever. Angel walks into the shadows (as in his very first appearance), saying with a smile, \\"I ain't getting any older.\\" Back at the house, Dawn angrily kicks Buffy in the shin for having Xander try to take her away from Sunnydale in the previous episode. Spike is in the basement, working out his anger on a punching bag with a crude drawing of Angel's face on it. He asks for the amulet, whose exchange he had witnessed from the shadows, and she explains that it is very powerful and meant only for a champion. She then hands it to him. Buffy tells Spike coyly that Faith is still sleeping in her room. Spike says he doesn't want Buffy downstairs with him, because he still has his pride and she has \\"Angel Breath\\". When Buffy starts to walk upstairs, he says that the whole pride thing was just a smoke-screen and he has none when it comes to her so she can stay. Late at night, as Buffy and Spike are sleeping in each other's arms, the First appears to taunt Buffy in the form of Caleb. His words give Buffy a plan; when Spike wakes up, Buffy tells him that she now knows that they will win. The next morning, Buffy unveils her plan to the potentials off- camera. Afterward, Willow expresses to Kennedy her concerns about using magic again. She says this is the most powerful magic she will have attempted and asks Kennedy to kill her if it turns bad. Faith and Principal Wood also have a discussion while preparing the school for the battle. Wood demonstrates that he understands her defensiveness over getting emotionally involved with men and asks her to give him a chance after the battle. During the night, Buffy goes to the basement, where she apparently spends her last night with Spike. The next morning, everyone arrives at Sunnydale High in a yellow school bus. The Slayers and the Potentials head to the seal in the basement while Kennedy helps Willow set up her spell in Principal Wood's office. After trying to give a farewell speech, Andrew is dragged off by Anya. Dawn leaves to set up her post with Xander, determined to see her sister again. Principal Wood leaves to wait at his post for Giles. The core four share a moment talking about going to the mall after saving the world which causes Giles to say \\"the earth is definitely doomed,\\" echoing the end of the second episode of the first season of Buffy. Xander and Willow walk down the hallway with Buffy before each one peels off, leaving Buffy walking alone to the seal. The Potentials, Faith and Spike are waiting, and the potentials/slayers cut their hands to open the seal with their blood. They climb down the hole in the ground and come face to face with the army of Turok-Han. The Ubervamps spot Buffy, Faith and the Potentials, and attack. \\"Come on, Will,\\" Buffy pleads. Willow sits in the school principal's office directly above the Seal, the scythe before her. While chanting a spell, she places her hands on the scythe, and both she and the weapon light up in an ethereal glow and her hair turns white, the opposite of Dark Willow. A flashback to Buffy's final speech to the Potentials reveals that Willow is channeling the essence of the scythe in order to activate Potentials all over the world. Defying the tradition of only one slayer per generation, Willow's spell will raise an army strong enough to do battle with The First. As Willow performs the actual magic, Kennedy tells Willow that she is a goddess. \\"And you're a Slayer,\\" Willow replies. Kennedy takes the scythe to Buffy, who is deep in the fight with Faith and Spike against the army of the Turok-Han, numbering in the thousands. As she pauses to give orders, Buffy is stabbed through her abdomen from behind by a Turok-Han and falls to the ground. She passes the scythe to Faith and asks her to hold the line. As she lies on the ground, she sees several Slayers fall, including Amanda. In the halls of the school, a few Turok-Han make it to the surface and attack the group guarding the entrances. A small group of Bringers also appear and attack. During the battle, Anya is bisected by a Bringer. Andrew fights until he is overwhelmed. Principal Wood is stabbed by a Bringer who is then killed by Giles. Xander and Dawn take on some Turok-Han who are disintegrated by sunlight when Dawn throws open a skylight window, but more follow. In the Hellmouth, the First then appears to Buffy as a mortally wounded Buffy herself, saying \\"What more do you want?\\". Ordering The First to \\"get out of my face!\\" Buffy arises with renewed determination and knocks several Turok-Han off the ledge. Other Slayers are reinvigorated as well. Just then, Spike's amulet consumes him in blue light and blasts a hole upward into the sky. The sunlight is channeled through his soul to the amulet and in powerful rays that begin dusting the ubervamps. The ground begins to shake and rocks tumble. The few surviving Slayers start to flee. Buffy tells Spike to do so as well, but he insists on finishing it. They share a quiet moment as the world crumbles around them. With tears in her eyes, Buffy tells Spike she loves him (fulfilling a prediction by Cassie in \\"Help\\"); Spike replies, \\"No you don't. But thanks for saying it.\\" He orders her to leave as he has to stay and finish the job. As Buffy flees, Spike laughs, \\"I wanna see how it ends.\\" Spike burns to dust as the Hellmouth collapses. On the way out of the school, the Slayers find Andrew crouched in a corner. Xander yells for Anya, whose body lies nearby, unseen. Dawn pulls him out. The survivors board a school bus and flee. Buffy runs across rooftops to catch up, and leaps onto the top of the bus. The entire town of Sunnydale collapses into the Hellmouth cavern, leaving a large crater. The ground stops shaking. Andrew comforts Xander by telling him that Anya died saving his life; Xander smiles, \\"That's my girl: always doing the stupid thing.\\" While a few of the new Slayers tend to the wounded, the other survivors look back at the crater's rim. Dawn ponders, \\"What are we going to do now?\\" Buffy slowly begins to smile, knowing that she is no longer alone in the world and that the burden of being the one chosen Slayer is no longer on her shoulders. Production details Originally the series finale was planned as a two-hour event. Unfortunately UPN only ordered 22 episodes instead of the required 23. This was why stories were so rushed at the end according to Gellar. It was also necessary for UPN to not have aired a two-hour event, because it may interrupt local programming (likely Newscast). =Writing= *Season seven explores the fundamental separation between the Slayer and other people, which the series finale turns upside down. As J. Lichtenberg points out in her essay on heroism in the Buffyverse, Buffy is a hero because she makes her own rules. \\"Finally an adult, Buffy rejects the fate laid out for her by the Council of Watchers and a couple of old men millennia ago,\\" Lichtenberg writes. \\"She finally achieves her goal of normality - not by changing her own nature, but by making others like her.\\" *In a BBC interview before this episode aired, writer/director Joss Whedon said, \\"If nobody cries... then I've definitely failed. It's really emotional - you're supposed to laugh, cry and gasp with excitement - as well as take away a beautiful feminist message.\\" He acknowledges that the magic unleashed from the scythe in this episode is \\"somewhat convenient,\\" but as a writer, it was more important for him to get to the show's message of empowerment by showing what Willow's magic and Buffy's status as the Slayer means to each of them.Whedon, Joss, \\"Chosen\\" (Commentary by Joss Whedon), Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Seventh Season on DVD, Twentieth Century Fox, 2004. He also admits that the Turok-Han vampires are far easier to kill in this episode than in previous episodes (in which Anya noted their tough chest bones make staking them extremely difficult) because \\"Again, I was more interested in the showing the empowerment than I was in the continuity.\\" *Whedon knew he \\"wanted to kill somebody, and [...] wanted to do it brutally and suddenly and never really pay it off. [He] wanted a death that was a real middle-of-the-battle death ‚Äî the opposite of the Spike death, [which was] perfect, noble.\\" Emma Caulfield stated at the beginning of Season 7 that this would be her last season on Buffy, even if the show was renewed for another season, and so Caulfield was fine with having Anya be the character who was killed. *In the DVD commentary, Joss Whedon says that he wanted Angel to exit the show exactly like he entered, backing out into the darkness behind him. Reception \\"Chosen\\" attracted 4.9 million viewers on its original run. SFX, a British sci-fi magazine, listed \\"Chosen\\" the 8th best episode of Buffy (number one was \\"Hush\\"). The episode was nominated for both a 2003 Emmy Award in the Category of Special Visual Effects for a Series, and for the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. The Futon Critic named it the 50th best episode of 2003, saying \\"the final Buffy from Joss Whedon's pen was a reason to celebrate in 2003: back was the snappy dialogue we've come to expect from the show over the years. In essence the show came to life just as its run drew to a close. Not a bad way to go out.\\" In May 2013, Entertainment Weekly named \\"Chosen\\" as number nine on their list of 20 Best TV Series Finales Ever. The L.A. Times also named the episode number 13 as their most memorable TV series finales.

The game was remastered in HD by Supermassive Games and re-released within the Killzone Trilogy for PlayStation 3 as well as a standalone PSN title in 2012. Killzone takes place in the middle of the 24th century and chronicles the war between two human factions; the Vektans, and the Helghast. The game is played from a first-person view and follows Jan Templar, a high-ranking officer within the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance, as he battles invading Helghast forces on his homeworld of Vekta. Prior to its release Killzone was heavily anticipated with several publications considering it to be Sony's \\"Halo killer\\" title. Upon release, however, the game was met with divided responses, with most critics praising Killzone's visuals, art design, soundtrack and atmosphere, but agreed that the final product was disappointing, with criticism also aimed at the game's narrative, characters and gameplay. Despite mixed reactions, Killzone spawned numerous sequels. Its direct sequel, Killzone 2, was critically acclaimed. Plot Killzone takes place in a fictional world set in the year 2357. After nuclear war rendered much of the Earth uninhabitable in 2055, world governments formed an international order known as the United Colonial Nations. Partnering with private firms, the UCN moved to establish human colonies in Alpha Centauri, a system occupied by two planets: Vekta, a rich Earth-like world (named after the CEO of the mining conglomerate Helghan, Philip Vekta), and Helghan, a barren wasteland named after the same company. The Helghan Corporation sought to buy ownership of Vekta as well, but when the UCN imposed sanctions against its unfair business practices, a war broke out (known as the First Extrasolar War), which led to the ISA, the military arm of the UCN, driving the company out of Vekta. In response, the exiled colonists established their own civilization on Helghan, built on the principles of militarism and authoritarianism. The harsh environment and atmosphere killed many Helghans, forcing the survivors to use respirators and air tanks just to breathe. Eventually, the population, now known as the Helghast, mutated into pale-skinned hairless humanoids with increased strength, stamina, and intelligence. Violently xenophobic and convinced of their superiority, the Helghan consider humans to be beneath them, and dream of one day reconquering Vekta and expanding their empire to Earth and the neighboring star systems. =Story= Scolar Visari, emperor of Helghan, sends the Helghast Third Army to launch a secret invasion of Vekta. Alerted to the attack, the ISA attempt to prevent it with their SD (Solar Defense) network, but are unable to activate it in time to stop the invaders. With the element of surprise on their side, the Helghast quickly overwhelm the unprepared ISA ground forces and capture several strategic locations, including ISA Central Command. While taking part in an offensive to slow the Helghast assault, Captain Jan Templar, a veteran ISA officer, is summoned to a meeting by his mentor and close friend, General Bradley Vaughton. Vaughton discloses that the ISA has requested assistance from the UCN and are working to restore the defense network. He also reveals that Colonel Gregor Hakha, a half-Helghan intelligence officer, had, on his orders, infiltrated the inner circle of Third Army commander General Joseph Lente, only to vanish while traveling to an extraction point in Vekta's slums. As Hakha is the only individual with knowledge of how the invasion bypassed SD, he assigns Jan to locate him. After fighting his way through the Helghast occupying the exterior of Central Command, Jan runs into Luger, a former comrade who is now working with an elite ISA division known as the Shadow Marshals. He also recruits the services of Ricardo Velasquez, an ISA gunner seeking revenge for the massacre of his entire platoon. After rescuing Hakha, the team discovers that General Stuart Adams, the overseer for SD, is secretly working for Lente. He murders Vaughton and takes control of the system, planning to use it to destroy the relief fleet headed to Vekta. Under Jan's leadership, the team destroys several Helghast bases and infrastructure projects, eventually intercepting and killing Lente when he tries to deal with them personally. Adams retreats to the SD control center and tries to reason with the group, explaining that the Helghast will stop at nothing to reclaim Vekta, regardless of how many lives they lose. Nevertheless, the team disables the station and escapes just as the fleet destroys it, killing Adams. Jan and Luger speculate about what the future holds, realizing that the real war is far from over. =Voice cast= * Kal Weber as Captain Jan Templar * Taylor Lawrence as Shadow Marshal Luger (credit as Jennifer Lawrence) * Tom Clarke Hill as Sgt.

Reviewers cited technical problems with Killzone, including inconsistent AI, occasional bugs, frame-rate issues, distracting graphical glitches, repetition of the same voices, short draw distance, and an awkward control system. Critics also complained about the gameplay, with IGN labeling it \\"underwhelming and mediocre\\". Reviewers such as GameSpy claimed that Killzone partly suffered due to the incredible publicity it received before release, raising expectations only for them to go unfulfilled. Despite this, Killzone was admired for its sound effects, its soundtrack, and its presentation of a gritty war zone; it was also credited for its unique hard sci-fi art design. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Sega on October 27, 2005, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one nine, one eight, and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.

She first appears in the original Art of Fighting being kidnapped by Mr. Big, a criminal from the city of South Town. The players, Yuri's brother Ryo and his friend Robert Garcia spend the game searching for her. In the sequel, Yuri appears for the first time as a playable character, having been trained by her father Takuma in the art of the Kyokugen Karate. Yuri has also starred in the anime adaptation from Art of Fighting, in which she reprises her role from the first game. She has appeared in most games from The King of Fighters series, with the notable exception of the non-canon The King of Fighters XII, participating in the annual tournaments from each title. She initially starts in the Women Fighters Team (composed entirely of women), but she later moves to the Art of Fighting Team along with her family. She was also featured in the SNK vs. Capcom crossover series as well as in SNK Gals' Fighters. Critical reception Yuri has been mostly positive for her transition from damsel in distress to a fighter in the Art of Fighting series. Her inclusion in The King of Fighters series was noted to give her more variety in her movesets which would appeal to gamers. Creation and design Yuri was created to be a woman spoiled by her older brother Ryo Sakazaki. Although she was given a tragic past due to her mother's death and her father's disappearance, SNK gave her an upbeat character. For the character voices, they used all pro or semi-pro voice actors. Yuri and King were done by the same person. Once it was announced Yuri would be a playable character in Art of Fighting 2, the staff behind The King of Fighters '94 wanted her to be as part of the cast. She replaced the character Big Bear from King's team due to memory issues. Afterwards, the team added Mai Shiranui to the team and form the Women's Team. Yuri's designer said the character had some bosom animation but not as much as Mai; she spent much work on Yuri's calves. Additionally, the Art of Fighting staff wanted Yuri to appear in the game, thus, she was added to the Women Fighters Team as the leader. In making Yuri for The King of Fighters XIII, director Kei Yamamoto stated Yuri wanted the character's moves to focus on kicks. Due to the skill required to perform some of her special attacks, Yamamoto feels Yuri's players to train themselves in order to use her properly. There was originally an attempt to give the character one of Robert Garcia's moves because of both of them handling their lower limbs, but was removed due to not fitting Yuri. Yuri's redesign gave the staff a good impression in how she her sprites changed, especially liking the universal lower body due to her combination of white gi and blue pants. KOF: Maximum Impact marks the first time since Art of Fighting 2 that she has received a new outfit. Such outfit is composed of a green camo print shirt, short pants, dark green gloves and green shoes. In KOF: Maximum Impact 2, some of her extra normal outfits make her look like fellow Kyokugen practitioners; color scheme B makes her look like Ryo (blond hair, orange gi and black tights), while scheme F resembles Robert Garcia's outfit from The King of Fighters '99 to 2002, which consists of brown hair, orange gi with black long-sleeved tights, and no headband. Appearances =Video games= Although Yuri is not playable in the first Art of Fighting game, she plays a big role in the plot as she is kidnapped by the Southtown criminal Mr. Big, causing Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia to search for her throughout the game. In the end, Ryo and Robert fight Mr. Karate, a soldier from Mr. Big taking Yuri as a hostage, but they are stopped by Yuri who reveals that he is Takuma. In Art of Fighting 2, Yuri becomes a playable character, being trained by Takuma after the events from the previous game. Yuri enters into the King of Fighters tournament along with Ryo, Robert and Takuma in order to defeat Geese Howard, the criminal who turned Takuma into Mr. Karate, wanting him to kill people. Yuri uses the lowest-grade Kyokugenryu movelist in the discipline, called the Raiou principle, which taught only the basic and low-level moves and encouraged personal instinct to be used in conjunction with the tutelage. Among Yuri's personally-crafted moves are the Slipstream Handslap and the Big Butt Press. Because of Yuri's ability to craft techniques based on basic Kyokugen principle, Takuma is slowly acknowledging her as a true Kyokugen disciple. In Art of Fighting 3, Yuri is once again unplayable, but she appears along with Ryo searching for Robert, who was helping a childhood friend known as Freya Lawrence. Yuri starts also to be attracted to Robert, something noted by Ryo to the point of telling her to accompany of a journey in the ending. Yuri is also a playable character in The King of Fighters series first as part of the Women Fighters Team along with Mai Shiranui and King participating in the annual King of Fighters tournaments. In The King of Fighters '96, Yuri is requested by Takuma to participate in the Art of Fighting Team along with Ryo and Robert as Takuma decided to retire from the team. The King of Fighters '98 too features Yuri playable with her Art of Fighting 2 moveset as a hidden character. Due to the new rule that teams must be composed of four members, Takuma returns to the Art of Fighting Team in The King of Fighters '99. In The King of Fighters 2000, Yuri returns to the Women Fighters Team along with Mai, Hinako Shijou and Kasumi Todoh, having asked King to replace her in the Art of Fighting Team wanting more independence. Yuri once again returns to the Art of Fighting Team in The King of Fighters 2001 wanting to win the prize money to help Robert with several economical problems his company has. Although The King of Fighters 2002 does not feature a storyline, Yuri is once again in the Women Fighters Team with Mai and May Lee, but was moved back to the Art of Fighting Team in the remake, The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match. In The King of Fighters 2003 and XI, Yuri continues in the Art of Fighting Team, but only with Ryo and Robert as the tournament once again requires only 3 fighters per team. Yuri's next official King of Fighters appearance was in The King of Fighters XIII, where she joins her fellow team members from The King of Fighters '94. However, by The King of Fighters XIV, Takuma fell ill as he had to not only manage the dojo but also his restaurant named \\"Kyokugen BBQ\\", thus prompting Yuri to not only leaving her '94 team members for her '96 team members Ryo and Robert, also to surpass her family. Yuri appears in the spin- off game The King of Fighters Neowave with the original Women Fighters Team. In The King of Fighters: Kyo the lead character Kyo Kusanagi finds Yuri telling Takuma and Ryo that she wants to return to the Women Fighters Team. After a long discussion, Kyo proposes a fight with them to decide if Yuri can leave. Yuri later appears helping Kyo to find his kidnapped girlfriend Yuki along with Ryo and Robert. She appears as an assistant character (named \\"Striker\\") in The King of Fighters EX for the Art of Fighting Team, and as a playable character along with Ryo and Takuma in The King of Fighters EX2. She is also featured in the 3D games KOF: Maximum Impact and Maximum Impact 2 participating in new tournaments from Southtown. The spin-offs King of Fighters R-1 and King of Fighters R-2 feature Yuri as part of the Super Babe Team alongside Athena Asamiya and Kasumi Todoh. Additionally, she stars in most games from the SNK vs. Capcom series except SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos (where she makes a cameo appearance in Ryo's and Mr. Karate's endings). In the crossover SNK Gals' Fighters Yuri appears as a playable character with her wanting to start her own gym, while she also appears in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. She is furthermore present in the cellphone games such as KOF Gals Mahjong, The King of Fighters '98: Ulimited Match Online, The King of Fighters All Star and Kimi wa Hero. Her character design serves as downloadable content in Dead or Alive 5 Last Round, as well as Lucent Heart. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, she has a cameo appearance as a background character on the King of Fighters Stadium stage. =Other appearances= Yuri appears in various SNK manga and in the Art of Fighting anime adaptation which retells the story from the first game but with Mr. Big wanting to obtain a diamond that Ryo and Robert found. She is voiced by Ayumi Hamasaki (before her rise to stardom as a pop singer) in the Japanese version and by Veronica Taylor in the English dub. An action figure of her character was released by SNK Playmore. Many statuette figures have been released by various manufacturers. Reception and cultural impact Yuri has been well received by Japanese gamers, having been voted as the 19th favorite character in the 1997 character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website. In 1995, Japanese magazine Gamest ranked her as number seven in the list of the top characters of 1994. In 2018, Yuri was voted as the tenth most popular Neo Geo character. Yuri's character has received mixed responses from English-language video games publication based on her role in Art of Fighting. Eurogamer noted that Yuri's kidnap in the first game was \\"a mostly unfathomable quest\\", senseless since she is later taken as hostage by her own father. GamingExellence liked Yuri's introduction in Art of Fighting 2 as a playable character as it gave more variety to the character roster. However, he complained about her being removed in Art of Fighting 3 \\"with less than stellar replacements\\" Similarly, IGN enjoyed Yuri's charactization in the sequel due to how it contrast her previous role of a damsel in distress. with Thunderbolt sharing similar opinions due to the variety of new characters in the sequel. HonestGamers found hilarious Yuri's interactions with Ryo in the second Art of Fighting game but lamented how she was unplayable in the third and how she only made cameos to assist Robert. Complex saw her as dertivative archetype based on Ryu from Street Fighter though the site found her brother closer to the design. Journalists also explored Yuri's role in The King of Fighters franchise. The Armchair Empire liked her cosplay by Fio from the Metal Slug series in KOF: Maximum Impact as it contrasted other new outfits which he considered embarrassing. Den of Geek listed her as the 67th best The King of Fighters character for her upbeat personality as well as the impact she made in Art of Fighting 2 when she became a playable character. Originally absent from KOF XII, Eurogamer appreciated Yuri's return to The King of Fighters XIII as she once again forms the Women Fighters Team. PC Mag criticized how in KOF XIII both Yuri's and King's outfits can be destroyed if they are defeated through special moves due to the humillation this gives them. Niche Gamer stated that while the Art of Fighting team from The King of Fighters XIV perform similar moves, they still provide varierty, referring to Yuri's as \\"both cute and utterly unpredictable\\". Den of Geek noted that the trio and the team in general has been characterized as more comical characters in The King of Fighters than in Art of Fighting though in XI they accidentally created their own rival. While the character of Dan Hibiki from the Street Fighter series is deemed as a parody of Ryo due to his similarities with Ryu and Ken from such series, he often shows mannerisms similar to Yuri's.Top 25 Street Fighter Characters - Day III . IGN. Retrieved on August 15, 2008 Mangaka Nobuhiro Watsuki designed the character of Makimachi Misao for the Rurouni Kenshin manga series, some fans complained that the character was very similar to Nakoruru from the Samurai Shodown video games series. However, Watsuki responded saying that the character was more similar to Mai Shiranui or Yuri, comically saying he was \\"making his own grave\\" due to the similarities with the SNK characters.

Grossmann was a member of an old Swiss family from Zurich. His father managed a textile factory. He became a Professor of Mathematics at the Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, today the ETH Zurich, specializing in descriptive geometry. Career In 1900 Grossmann graduated from the Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) and became an assistant to the geometer Wilhelm Fiedler. He continued to do research on non- Euclidean geometry and taught in high schools for the next seven years. In 1902, he earned his doctorate from the University of Zurich with the thesis Ueber die metrischen Eigenschaften kollinearer Gebilde (translated On the Metrical Properties of Collinear Structures) with Fiedler as advisor. In 1907, he was appointed full professor of descriptive geometry at the Federal Polytechnic School. As a professor of geometry, Grossmann organized summer courses for high school teachers. In 1910, he became one of the founders of the Swiss Mathematical Society. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge UK and in 1920 at Strasbourg. =Collaborations with Albert Einstein= Albert Einstein's friendship with Grossmann began with their school days in Zurich. Grossmann's careful and complete lecture notes at the Federal Polytechnic School proved to be a salvation for Einstein, who missed many lectures.Alice Calaprice, Daniel Kennefick, Robert Schulmann, An Einstein Encyclopedia, Princeton University Press, 2015, p. 70. Grossmann's father helped Einstein get his job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, and it was Grossmann who helped to conduct the negotiations to bring Einstein back from Prague as a professor of physics at the Zurich Polytechnic. Grossmann was an expert in differential geometry and tensor calculus; just the mathematical tools providing a proper mathematical framework for Einstein's work on gravity. Thus, it was natural that Einstein would enter into a scientific collaboration with Grossmann.J. Earman and C. Glymour, Lost in the Tensors: Einstein's Struggles with Covariance Principles, 1912-1916, footnote page 255; Carnegie Mellon University Research Showcase (accessed February 12, 2016) It was Grossmann who emphasized the importance of a non-Euclidean geometry called Riemannian geometry (also elliptic geometry) to Einstein, which was a necessary step in the development of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Abraham Pais's book on Einstein suggests that Grossmann mentored Einstein in tensor theory as well. Grossmann introduced Einstein to the absolute differential calculus, started by Christoffel and fully developed by Ricci- Curbastro and Levi-Civita. Grossmann facilitated Einstein's unique synthesis of mathematical and theoretical physics in what is still today considered the most elegant and powerful theory of gravity: the general theory of relativity. The collaboration of Einstein and Grossmann led to a ground-breaking paper: \\"Outline of a Generalized Theory of Relativity and of a Theory of Gravitation\\", which was published in 1913 and was one of the two fundamental papers which established Einstein's theory of gravity. Death Grossmann died of multiple sclerosis in 1936. The community of relativists celebrates Grossmann's contributions to physics by organizing Marcel Grossmann meetings every three years.  Legacy  The International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics presents the Marcel Grossmann Awards. Each recipient receives a silver casting if the T. E. S. T. sculpture by the artist A. Pierelli. Each year, an institution is selected and between two and six individual scientists are selected.

It was designed by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and built between 1905 and 1908. Unity Temple is considered to be one of Wright's most important structures dating from the first decade of the twentieth century. Because of its consolidation of aesthetic intent and structure through use of a single material, reinforced concrete, Unity Temple is considered by many architects to be the first modern building in the world. This idea became of central importance to the modern architects who followed Wright, such as Mies Van Der Rohe, and even the post-modernists, such as Frank Gehry. The Unitarian Universalist congregation that worships in Unity Temple was formed in 1871, and has no connection with Unity Church, a religious organization founded in 1889. Background Exterior of the Unity Temple. In 1905, a lightning strike started a fire which destroyed the wood-framed Oak Park Unity Church, architect Frank Lloyd Wright was one of the many architects who vied for the commission, and was ultimately selected to design a new structure for the Universalist congregation of Oak Park, Illinois. The result was the Unity Temple. Wright was not only living in Oak Park but also came from a family of Unitarians, a faith that had many beliefs in common with Universalism. The congregation needed a space of worship, as well as a community room. There were several immediate problems that the architect had to work with in order to satisfy the client. The budget was $45,000, a modest amount even in the early 20th century. Building materials had to be inexpensive and as Wright said, ‚Äúconcrete is cheap.‚Äù The same concrete molds were used multiple times, as Wright had designed repeating walls with similar dimensions. Additionally, the building site stood on a busy street. And finally, the architect was expected to design not only the structure but also furniture and stained glass for the building. Charles E. Roberts, an engineer, inventor and an important early client of Frank Lloyd Wright, served on the church's building committee and was a key figure in seeing that Wright's vision for the church became a reality. For Roberts, Wright also remodeled Roberts' home and the Charles E. Roberts Stable. Design and construction Historic American Buildings Survey photograph To accommodate the needs of the congregation, Wright divided the community space from the temple space through a low, middle loggia that could be approached from either side. This was an efficient use of space and kept down on noise between the two main gathering areas: those coming for religious services would be separated via the loggia from those coming for community events. The plan of Wright's design looks back to the bipartite design of his own studio built several blocks away in 1898: with two portions of the building similar in composition and separated by a lower passageway, and one section being larger than the other (the Guggenheim Museum in New York City is another bipartite design). Also for the Temple's architecture, Wright borrowed several attributes from his previous creation, the Larkin Administration Building. Key features derived were use of stained glass windows as well as geometric figure. But, unlike the Larkin Building, the Temple's plan produced a perfect square, as opposed to the double-square rectangle of the Larkin. Interior of Unity Temple. To reduce noise from the street, Wright eliminated street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and clerestories along the upper walls. Because the members of the parish would not be able to look outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple rises a few steps above the main level of the building (which has seating space), and the room also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no one person in the congregation is more than 40 feet from the pulpit. Wright also designed the building with very good acoustics. The design of Unity Temple represents a leap forward in design for Wright. In recounting his experiences with Unity Temple, he stated that this design was the first time he ever realized that the real heart of a building is its space, not its walls. Indeed, architectural historians have commented on Wright's genius in creating and manipulating space in his designs; in his book The Master Builders, Peter Blake entitled the section on Wright \\"The Mastery of Space.\\" In addition to being very accomplished with making the most out of the space he had, Wright also found the concept of \\"Unity\\" was very prominent mainly because of how he managed to fuse together space, experience and the material world. This was key to Unity Temple which has both a common meeting area and the congregation of church-goers. The sanctuary space gives the best example of this according to practicing architect Robert McCarter. The building was completed in 1908 and officially dedicated on September 26, 1909. Significance The building has been a United States National Historic Landmark since 1971 and was chosen in a 1991 poll in the magazine, Architectural Record as one of the 100 most significant buildings in the United States of the previous 100 years (Unity Temple was #14). Additionally, Unity Temple was chosen by the American Institute of Architects as one of 17 buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright that should be retained as his architectural contribution to American culture. In 2008, the U.S. National Park Service submitted Unity Temple, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage Status. The 10 sites have been submitted as one, total, site. The January 22, 2008 press release from the National Park Service website announcing the nominations states that, \\"The preparation of a Tentative List is a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List.\\" After revised proposals, the properties were inscribed on the World Heritage List under the title \\"The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\\" in July 2019.  Restoration  A drawback to the modern design of the Unity Temple is structural problems that have emerged over time. Through the years of its existence, the Unity Temple's concrete structure has suffered extensive water damage. Pieces of the roof fell inside the structure, and water eroded other parts of the exterior, as well. The original Universalist (now Unitarian Universalist) congregation still uses Unity Temple, although a separate and secular organization, the Unity Temple Restoration Foundation , is in charge of the building's multimillion-dollar restoration effort. The foundation and church developed a restoration plan over many years, beginning in 2000. In April 2009, Unity Temple, due to water seepage, was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 11 most endangered historic places Chicago restoration architect Gunny Harboe was in charge of the restoration with CTLGroup providing the engineering and materials technology expertise. In April 2015, a $25 million interior and exterior restoration began. The restoration focused on structural improvements such as replacing the majority of the building's 16 separate flat roofs. The restoration also addressed decorative and environmental improvements to the building. Unity Temple closed to the public in June 2015. Restoration work was completed in June 2017 and the building reopened for tours as of July 1, 2017. The building remains closed to tours on Sundays, when the Unitarian Universalist church that calls the building home has its day of worship. The Unity Temple Restoration Foundation offers a full calendar of artistic and educational programming. www.utrf.org. In 2018, the restoration of the temple received an award for excellence by the American Institute of Architects, Chicago chapter, and in 2019 was awarded the Urban Land Institute - Chicago Vision Award for historic restoration.

This concerto was composed in Rome during a travel in Italy after the composer met a pianist in Munich. Mendelssohn attended one party after another in Munich in October 1831, the month of the premiere, but he also played chamber music and taught double counterpoint. He performed the piece himself at the premiere, which also included performances of his Symphony No. 1 and the Overture from Midsummer Night's Dream. He had already written a piano concerto in A minor with string accompaniment (1822) and two concertos with two pianos (1823-24).  Structure  The three connected movements use several relatively new formal techniques in their brief span -- for example, the piano enters very soon after the opening of the first movement, with little of an orchestral tutti to contrast with.Philip Radcliffe, Mendelssohn, (Oxford University Press: 2000), 100. The concerto quickly obtained popularity, and contains many sections of improvisation, one of Mendelssohn's specialities; it is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. # Molto allegro con fuoco in G minor # Andante in E major # Presto--Molto allegro e vivace in G major =Molto allegro con fuoco= The piano enters after only a few bars of orchestral introduction. It was standard procedure in the classical-era concerto to precede the solo's entrance by a tutti, for various reasons - the length and purpose of these introductions differed, some offering a hint of what was to follow and some giving out almost all the movement's material, but none was so brief as this: in this sense, this was one of the first concertos of the Romantic age. (The obvious exceptions - Mozart's Jeunehomme concerto and Beethoven's fourth and fifth piano concertos - allowed the piano to enter very briefly just at the start, but then proceeded as usual, the soloist silent.) The rest of the movement is fairly typical of concertos in its use of a modified sonata form, with a second, contrasting lyrical theme first heard from the piano over repeated accompaniment, and later on wind. As the movement closes a transition takes the movement not to a full close, but instead, with a brass fanfare and a piano continuation of the same, to the border of the Andante. =Andante= This opens with a melody in the lower strings, in E major, soon taken up by the piano. This is drawn out with breadth, and a middle section in B provides contrast. The original melody, somewhat varied, returns to close the movement. =Presto--Molto allegro e vivace= This opens with a fanfare in A minor (Presto). The piano joins in, at which point the mood lightens, and the closing rondo - Molto allegro e vivace - begins. This is regular in form, and the returns of the refrain are varied. Several themes from the first movement return towards the finale. Reception Though Mendelssohn said of the concerto \\"I wrote it in but a few days and almost carelessly\\", the concerto was extremely popular--partially due to the efforts of Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. Hector Berlioz described what happened to an √ârard piano on which the concerto was too often played: > ...the piano, which is out of its mind, has no intention of paying him any > heed either. He sends for holy water and sprinkles the keyboard with it, but > in vain--proof that it wasn't witchcraft but merely the natural result of > thirty performances of one concerto. They take the keyboard out of the > instrument--the keys are still moving up and down by themselves--and they > throw it into the middle of the courtyard next to the warehouse. There M. > Erard, now in a fury, has it chopped up with an axe. You think that did it? > it made matters worse. Each piece danced, jumped, frisked about separately-- > on the pavement, between our legs, against the wall, in all directions, > until the warehouse locksmith picked up this bedeviled mechanism in one > armful and flung it in the fire of his forge, finally putting an end of > it...Such a fine instrument!

If it is a spiral galaxy, it would be the smallest in the Local Group. NGC 3109 has a mass of about 2.3√ó109 times the mass of the Sun, of which 20% is in the form of neutral hydrogen. It is oriented edge-on from our point of view, and may contain a disk and a halo. The disk appears to be composed of stars of all ages, whereas the halo contains only very old and metal-poor stars. NGC 3109 does not appear to possess a galactic nucleus. From measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the galaxy, it has been found that the disk of NGC 3109 is warped. The warp has the same radial velocity as gas in the Antlia Dwarf galaxy, indicating that the two galaxies had a close encounter approximately one billion years ago. Composition Based on spectroscopy of blue supergiants in NGC 3109, it is known that the galaxy has a low metallicity, similar to that to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is one of the most metal-poor galaxies in the Local group. NGC 3109 seems to contain an unusually large number of planetary nebulae for its luminosity. It also contains a substantial amount of dark matter. Galaxy NGC 3109, by Hubble Space Telescope. Location NGC 3109 is located about away, in the constellation Hydra. This puts it at the very outskirts of the Local Group. Its membership of the Local Group has been questioned, because it seems to be receding faster than estimates of the Local Group's escape velocity. It is distant enough from the largest members of the Local Group that it has not been tidally influenced by them.

Organizationally it is part of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, and is currently a multi-tenant complex to allow commercial and government contractors, as well as government agencies, to use the site. MAF is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world with 43 environmentally controlled acres----under one roof, and it employs more than 4,200 people.https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/172203main_MAF_tenant_FS.pdf From September 1961 to the end of the Apollo program in December 1972 the site was utilized by Chrysler Corporation to build the first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB, later joined by Boeing Corporation to build the first stage of the Saturn V rockets. From September 5, 1973, to September 20, 2010, the factory was used for the construction of the Space Shuttle's external fuel tanks by Martin Marietta Corporation, Denver Colorado. History First stages of Saturn V rockets being assembled at the Michoud factory in the 1960s The facility was originally constructed in 1940 at the village of Michoud, Louisiana, by the Higgins-Tucker division of Higgins Industries under the direction of Andrew Jackson Higgins. Construction was done on behalf of the United States government for the war production during World War II of plywood C-76 cargo planes and landing craft. The project cost $180 million ($2.8 billion in 2018).https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/history-maf During the Korean War it made engines for Sherman and Patton tanks, and boasted a 5,500-foot paved runway. It came under the management of NASA in 1961, and was used for the construction of the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V rockets and the S-IB first stage of the Saturn IB rockets built by Chrysler Corporation. It is home to the first stage of the last-constructed Saturn V, SA-515, built by The Boeing Company. The factory's ceiling height limitation - 12 meters, was unable to allow the construction of the bigger Saturn C-8 direct Moon vehicle, was one of the major reasons why the smaller C-5 (later renamed Saturn V) was chosen instead of the originally planned Moon vehicle. The majority of the NASA factory's history was focused on construction and production of NASA's Space Shuttle external tank (ET). Beginning with the rollout of ET-1 on June 29, 1979, which flew on STS-1, 136 tanks were produced throughout the Space Shuttle program, ending with the flight-ready tank ET-122, which flew on STS-134, rolled out on September 20, 2010. A single tank produced at the facility, ET-94, was not used in spaceflight and remained at Michoud as a test article.Tank ET-122 ended up being the last, even though its sequence number was lower than the total number of tanks produced, because it had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina and required repairs prior to completion. Modular parts for the International Space Station were fabricated at the facility in the mid 1990s until 2010.https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/manufacturing_spinoffs.html = Hurricane Katrina = A section of eastern New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. MAF (green) is not flooded, while the surrounding neighborhoods (dark greenish brown) are extensively flooded. The facility did not experience significant flooding during Hurricane Katrina due to a natural ridge that runs along its northwestern boundary, the levee that makes up the southern and eastern boundaries, and the work of the pump operators who stayed to protect the facility during the storm. There was wind damage and rainwater damage to several buildings. All shifts were initially canceled up to September 26, 2005, potentially setting back future Shuttle flights. All the buildings and the shuttle hardware within survived the hurricane without grave damage, but the roof of the main manufacturing building was breached and debris damaged ET-122 stored inside; that tank was refurbished and later flew on the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour, STS-134. Thirty-eight NASA and Lockheed Martin employees stayed behind during Hurricane Katrina to operate the pumping systems, knowing that if not activated and sustained, the facility would have been destroyed. The workers pumped more than one billion gallons (3,800,000 m3) of water out of the facility and probably were the reason that the rocket factory suffered very little damage. These employees were each awarded the NASA Exceptional Bravery Medal, NASA's highest bravery award. On September 16, 2005 NASA announced that the repairs were progressing faster than anticipated, and so they would continue to use Michoud for external tank work. On October 3, 2005, the facility officially reopened for essential personnel, though some key personnel had returned earlier. On October 31 the facility reopened to all personnel. On February 7, 2017, an EF3 tornado carved a path through Orleans Parish, in which the factory is located. Two major buildings including the main manufacturing building were damaged, with multiple broken windows. 5 people were injured, and resulting repairs and other factors contributed to the delay of the first SLS launch until late 2020.  Buildings  Welding of the SLS liquid oxygen tank in the South Vertical Assembly Building The facility consists of four large buildings in one complex: * Building 1 comprises the main manufacturing building (Building number 103), and the North and South Vertical Assembly Buildings (Building numbers 115 and 110 respectively).

The main manufacturing building is where the majority of preliminary fabrication and welding activities take place - the Space Launch System core stage (and previously the Space Shuttle External Tank, ISS modular components, and the Saturn V first stage) were manufactured. The building stretches 512 by 340 meters in dimensions, and contains over 40 sub-areas for different manufacturing and structural assembly operations. A series of internal roads made from polished concrete provide ease of access by factory vehicles, trams, and overhead cranes to move components around. They run the whole length of the factory building. Factory floor office buildings and engineering rooms located in various ends of the main manufacturing building. Near the South VAB is an electric arc furnace and casting equipment. In front of the main manufacturing building is the administration offices, lobby, restaurants and engineering conference rooms. There is also a gym, retail stores, media lab, a medical area and a large cafeteria provided for the workers.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/268 Facing north is a factory floor museum display area, with mission patches, flags and memorials.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/amenitieshttps://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/286 * Building 2 is an external building that is used to manufacture smaller components and space station equipment, for example small components for the International Space Station. It also supplies various small components such as fasteners to the main building.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/533 * Building 3 is another external building for various manufacturing processes, and contains a laboratory, office space and technical storage areas.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/535 Building 3-20 is the employees dormitory building, and contains a restaurant and offices. * Building 4 is located south of the complex. It is an industrial workshop for the processing and application of spray-on insulation foam to SLS tank components. Space Shuttle external tank spares were also housed there.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/529 * Adjacent to the main manufacturing building are more foam application workshops, power transformers for the arc furnace and other facilities, and large amounts of open space. In front of the South VAB, rocket parts are moved from this building to the side internal workshops across the plaza for inspection and checks. The SLS core stage test simulator (made of steel) is also located in this area. * The National Finance Center (NSF) - located west of the complex; houses offices for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and contains several large conference rooms, a restaurant and a ballroom for NASA employees and visitor events. The shipping port is located 600 meters southwest of the main manufacturing building. Transporting vehicles carrying manufactured SLS components move down Saturn Blvd, past large open fields, to the pier - where the Pegasus Barge is docked. This is where the components are shipped to either their final destination - Kennedy Space Center, or rarely back to the main Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, or the John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi for testing.  Other and future activities  The Michoud main manufacturing building and the twin vertical assembly buildings as seen from a drone in January 2020.

Hadfield Rocket Factory,Hadfield at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 4, 2019 Lockheed Martin and NASA. The factory is now the location for the Space Launch System (SLS) being built by the Boeing company which will be the most powerful rocket in the history of spaceflight. It will carry the Orion spacecraft during its first launch to prove capabilities. Launch is set for no early than June 2020. The factory complex is open to the public (though through pre-booking in advance). Visitors must sign in at main reception and clear security.https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/today-at-maf/visitors-tours/ NASA planned to use the rocket factory to build the structure for several components of the cancelled Constellation program, including the Orion spacecraft, the Ares I Upper Stage, and the Ares V Core Stage. Under the Obama administration, the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010,\\"President Obama Signs New Vision for U.S. Space Exploration Into Law\\". Space.com, October 11, 2010. but was replaced with SLS a year later to continue space exploration efforts. NASA has an agreement in place to rent out a portion of the facility to Big Easy Studios, a New Orleans film studio.WWLTV News This deal has been criticized by competing studios as violating NASA's rule that any deal with an outside entity must serve the agency's mission and must not compete with the private sector. NASA officials defend the agreement, stating that this helps to offset the cost of unused space on the facility and that their pricing is vetted by state and local economic development agencies to ensure it is not competing with the private market. Portions of Ender's Game, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes were filmed at the factory. Incidents  On May 24, 1988, TACA Flight 110 operated with a Boeing 737-300 jetliner made a successful emergency landing on a grassy levee in the Michoud grounds after power was lost in both engines during a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft was towed into the Michoud facility, where its engines were replaced. On 6 June, it took off, with a crew of two and minimal fuel, using the former runway at Michoud, which had been reused as a road, Saturn Boulevard. It was flown the short distance to New Orleans International Airport, where it was repaired. Over the years, several reported incidents of robbery and terrorism occurred at the facility; where trespassers on numerous occasions have been known to break in and have stolen technical paperwork. As a result, public visitors and employees taking photographs inside is highly regulated by NASA officials. There was a recent bomb threat to MAF; and after 9/11, double-perimeter security fences were installed in 2007‚Äì2008. At the same time, all of the front windows of the administration offices were upgraded with black-anodized shatter-proof transparent panels.

They were one of the last native groups in South America to be encountered by migrant ethnic Europeans in the late 19th century. In the mid-19th century, there were about 4000 Selk'nam; by 1919 there were 297, and by 1930 just over 100. They are considered extinct as a tribe. The exploration of gold and the introduction of farming in the region of Tierra del Fuego has led to a drastic decline in the numbers of their population, a process that is described as a genocide. Joubert Yanten Gomez, a Chilean mestizo of part Selk'nam ancestry, has taught himself the language and is considered the only speaker; he uses the name Keyuk.Judith Thurman, \\"A Loss for Words\\", The New Yorker, 30 March 2015 While the Selk'nam are closely associated with living in the northeastern area of Tierra del Fuego,Anitei, Stefan. \\"The Enigma of the Natives of Tierra del Fuego ‚Äì Are Alacaluf and Yahgan the last Native Black Americans?\\", Softpedia they are believed to have originated as a people on the mainland. Thousands of years ago, they migrated by canoe across the Strait of Magellan.Frederick Webb Hodge, Proceedings: Held at Washington, December 27‚Äì31, 1915, original from Harvard University, 649 pages Their territory in the early Holocene probably ranged as far as the Cerro Ben√≠tez area of the Cerro Toro mountain range in Chile.C. Michael Hogan, Cueva del Milodon, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham, 2008 Selknam people in 1930  Lifestyle  Traditionally, the Selk'nam were nomadic people who relied on hunting for survival. They dressed sparingly despite the cold climate of Patagonia. They shared Tierra del Fuego with the Haush (or Manek'enk), another nomadic culture who lived in the south-eastern part of the island. Also in the region were the Y√°mana or Yahgan.  Relations with Europeans  Julius Popper during a manhunt of the Ona people. In the late 19th century estancieros and gold prospectors launched a campaign of extermination against the indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego. The Selk'nam had little contact with ethnic Europeans until settlers arrived in the late 19th century. These newcomers developed a great part of the land of Tierra del Fuego as large estancias (sheep ranches), depriving the natives of their ancestral hunting areas. Selk'nam, who considered the sheep herds to be game rather than private property (which they did not have as a concept) hunted the sheep. The ranch owners considered this to be poaching, and paid armed groups or militia to hunt down and kill the Selk'nam, in what is now called the Selk'nam Genocide. To receive their bounty, such groups had to bring back the ears of victims. Salesian missionaries worked to protect and preserve Selk'nam culture. Father Jos√© Mar√≠a Beauvoir explored the region and studied the native Patagonian cultures and languages between 1881 and 1924. He compiled a vocabulary of Selk'nam of 4,000 words and 1400 phrases and sentences, which was published in 1915. He included a comparative list of 150 Ona-Tehuelche words, as he believed that there were connections to the Tehuelche people and language to the north. German anthropologist Robert Lehmann-Nitsche published the first scholarly studies of the Selk‚Äônam, although he was later criticized for having studied members of the Selk‚Äônam people who had been abducted and were exhibited in circuses. Relations with Europeans in the Beagle Channel area in the southern area of the island of Tierra del Fuego were somewhat more cordial than with the ranchers. Thomas Bridges, who had been an Anglican missionary at Ushuaia, retired from that service. He was given a large land grant by the Argentine government, where he founded Estancia Harberton. Lucas Bridges, one of his three sons, did much to help the local cultures. Like his father, he learned the languages of the various groups and tried to provide the natives with some space in which to live their customary lives as \\"lords of their own land\\". The forces of change were against them, and the indigenous people continued to have high fatality rates as their cultures were disrupted. Lucas Bridges' book, Uttermost Part of the Earth (1948), provides sympathetic insight into the lives of the Selk'nam and Yahgan.  Demise  The Selknam with clothes Two Christian missions were established to save the Selk'nam. They were intended to provide housing and food for the natives, but closed due to the small number of Selk'nam remaining; they had numbered in the thousands before Western colonization, but by the early twentieth century only a few hundred remained. The last ethnic Selk'nam died in the mid-twentieth century. Alejandro Ca√±as estimated that in 1896 there was a population of 3,000 Selk'nam. Mart√≠n Gusinde, an Austrian priest and ethnologist who studied them in the early 20th century, wrote in 1919 that only 279 Selk'nam remained. In 1945 the Salesian missionary, Lorenzo Massa, counted 25.Gerardo Rafael √Ålvarez. Explotaci√≥n ganadera y exterminio de la raza ona In May 1974 √Ångela Loij, the last full-blood Selk'nam, died. There are probably surviving descendants of partial Selk'nam ancestry. According to the Argentine census of 2001, there were 391 Selk'nam (Ona) living in the island of Tierra del Fuego, and an additional 114 in other parts of Argentina.  Culture and religion  The missions and early 20th-century anthropologists collected information about Selk'nam religion and traditions while trying to help them preserve their culture. Missionaries also compiled a short dictionary of the Selk'nam language. =Language= The Selk'nam spoke a Chon language. The last native speaker died in 1974 but Joubert Yanten Gomez, a linguistic prodigy from Santiago, Chile, taught himself the language in the early 21st century while still a teenager. He calls himself by a Selk'nam name, Keyuk. He studied a lexicon published in 1915 by Jos√© Mar√≠a Beauvoir, a Salesian missionary. He also studied recordings of the language made by noted anthropologist Anne Chapman forty years ago, in order to learn its sound. He speaks several other indigenous languages and is learning Yagan. =Religion= Selk'nam religion was a complex system of beliefs. It described spirit beings as a part of the past, in creation myth. Tem√°ukel was the name of the great supernatural entity who they believed kept the world order. The creator deity of the world was called K√©nos or Qu√©nos.Dick Edgar Ibarra Grasso. Cosmogonia y Mitolog√≠a Ind√≠gena Americana, Editorial Kier, 1997. p√°gina 65. , Many of their tales recounted shaman-like characters. Such a has supernatural capabilities, e.g. he can control weather.Martin Gusinde: Nordwind‚ÄîS√ºdwind. Mythen und M√§rchen der Feuerlandindianer (North Wind-South Wind. Myths and Fables of the Fuegian Indians). Kassel: E. R√∂th, 1966About the Ona Indian Culture in Tierra Del Fuego , Victory Cruises =Initiation ceremonies= Selk'nam male initiation ceremonies, the passage to adulthood, was called Hain. Nearby indigenous peoples, the Yahgan and Haush, had similar initiation ceremonies. Young males were called to a dark hut. There they would be attacked by \\"spirits\\", who were people dressed as supernatural beings. The children were taught to believe in and fear these spirits at childhood and were threatened by them in case they misbehaved. Their task in this rite of passage was to unmask the spirits; when the boys saw that the spirits were human, they were told a story of world creation related to the sun and moon. In a related story, they were told that in the past women used to be disguised as spirits to control men. When the men discovered the masquerade, they, in turn, would threaten women as spirits. According to the men, the women never learned that the masked males were not truly spirits, but the males found out at the initiation rite. The contemporary ceremonies used this interplay in somewhat of a joking way. After the first day, related ceremonies and rituals took place. Males showed their \\"strength\\" in front of women by fighting spirits (who were other males but the women supposedly did not know it) in some theatrical fights. Each spirit was played with traditional actions, words and gestures, so that everyone could identify it. The best spirit actors from previous Hains were called again to impersonate spirits in later Hains. Apart from these dramatic re-enactments of mythic events, the Hain involved tests for young males for courage, resourcefulness, resisting temptation, resisting pain and overcoming fear. It also included prolonged instructional courses to train the young men in the tasks for which they would be responsible.Anne Chapman, Drama and Power in a Hunting Society: the Selk'nam of Tierra del Fuego, Cambridge 1982Philip McCouat, \\"Art and Survival in Patagonia\\", Journal of Art in Society Before European encounter, the various rites of the Hain lasted a very long time, perhaps even a year on occasion. It would end with the last fight against the \\"worst\\" spirit. Usually Hains were started when there was enough food (for example a whale was washed onto the coast), a time when all the Selk'nam from all the bands used to gather at one place, in male and female camps. \\"Spirits\\" sometimes went to female encampments to scare them, as well as moving around and acting out in ways that related to their characters. The last Hain was held in one of the missions in the early 20th century, and was photographed by missionary Martin Gusinde. It was a shorter and smaller ceremony than they used to hold. The photos show the \\"spirit\\" costumes they created and wore. Gusinde's The Lost Tribes of Tierra Del Fuego (2015) was published in English by Thames & Hudson, and in French and Spanish by √âditions Xavier Barral.Glenn H. Shepard Jr., \\"Specters of a Civilization:\\" review of Martin Gusinde's Lost Tribes of Tierra del Fuego, New York Review of Books, 9 August 2015, accessed 9 September 2015  Heritage  Bow and arrows Pictures of Selk'nam people taken by the missionaries are displayed at the Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum at Puerto Williams. There are also a few books on the subject, including Selk'nam tales, collected by the missions, and a dictionary of the Selk'nam language. Due to early contact by missionaries, they collected much more information about the Selk'nam people than about other people of the region. Austrian priest and ethnologist Martin Gusinde tried also to collect information about other local nations, but he found their numbers much reduced. He was able to write more about traditional Selk'nam culture because it was still being lived. The 2010 National Population Census in Argentina revealed the existence of 2,761 people who recognized themselves as Onas throughout the country, 294 of them in the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and the South Atlantic Islands (Land of Fire).

Distribution and habitat The range is in Colorado, southern Wyoming, eastern and central Utah, northern Arizona, New Mexico, western Oklahoma, southeastern California, and the Guadalupe Mountains in far western Texas. It occurs at moderate altitudes of , rarely as low as and as high as . It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, usually mixed with junipers in the pinyon-juniper woodland plant community. The Colorado pinyon (pi√±on) grows as the dominant species on 4.8 million acres () in Colorado, making up 22% of the state's forests. The Colorado pinyon has cultural meaning to agriculture, as strong pi√±on wood \\"plow heads\\" were used to break soil for crop planting at the state's earliest known agricultural settlements. There is one known example of a Colorado pinyon growing amongst Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and limber pine (Pinus flexilis) at nearly on Kendrick Peak in the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona. Description The pi√±on pine (Pinus edulis) is a small to medium size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The leaves ('needles') are in pairs, moderately stout, long, and green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces but distinctly more on the inner surface forming a whitish band. The cones are globose, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18‚Äì20 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5‚Äì10 fertile scales. The cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing. The species intermixes with Pinus monophylla sbsp. fallax (see description under Pinus monophylla) for several hundred kilometers along the Mogollon Rim of central Arizona and the Grand Canyon resulting in trees with both single- and two- needled fascicles on each branch. The frequency of two-needled fascicles increases following wet years and decreases following dry years. The internal anatomy of both these needle types are identical except for the number of needles in each fascicle suggesting that Little's 1968 designation of this tree as a variety of Pinus edulis is more likely than its subsequent designation as a subspecies of Pinus monophylla based entirely upon its single needle fascicle. It is an aromatic species. Essential oil can be extracted from the trunk, limbs, needles, and seed cones. Prominent aromatic compounds from each portion of the tree include Œ±-pinene, sabinene, Œ≤-pinene, Œ¥-3-carene, Œ≤-phellandrene, ethyl octanoate, longifolene, and germacrene D. Ecology The seeds are dispersed by the pinyon jay, which plucks them out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. The seeds are also eaten by wild turkey, Montezuma quail, and various mammals. History Colorado pinyon was described by George Engelmann in 1848 from collections made near Santa Fe, New Mexico on Alexander William Doniphan's expedition to northern Mexico in 1846. It is most closely related to the single-leaf pinyon, which hybridises with it occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It is also closely related to the Texas pinyon, but is separated from it by a gap of about so does not hybridise with it. An isolated population of trees in the New York Mountains of southeast California, previously thought to be Colorado pinyons, have recently been shown to be a two-needled variant of single-leaf pinyon from chemical and genetic evidence. Occasional two-needled pinyons in northern Baja California, Mexico have sometimes been referred to Colorado pinyon in the past, but are now known to be hybrids between single-leaf pinyon and Parry pinyon. Uses Cones of P. edulis The edible seeds, pine nuts, are extensively collected throughout its range; in many areas, the seed harvest rights are owned by Native American tribes, for whom the species is of immense cultural and economic importance. They can be stored for a year when unshelled. One early legend asserts that the \\"tree of life\\" is a pinyon pine, rooted in ancient cultural sites found within areas of pinyon (pi√±on) Canyon, Colorado. Archaeologist Harold S. Gladwin described pit-houses constructed by southwestern Native Americans 400‚Äì900 CE; these were fortified with posts made from Pinyon trunks and coated with mud. The habitat destruction by deforestation of large areas of pinyon forests in the interests of cattle ranching, for habitat conversion to grazing rangeland, is seen by many as an act of major ecological and cultural vandalism. Colorado pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a Christmas tree. The pi√±on pine (Pinus edulis) is the state tree of New Mexico.

The massacres occurred at Doringkop, Bloukrans River, Moordspruit, Rensburgspruit and other sites around the present day town of Weenen in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. Massacre After killing Piet Retief and about 100 people of his delegation, the Zulu King Dingane sent his impis to kill the remaining voortrekkers who were camped at Doringkop, Bloukrans (Blaauwekrans), Moordspruit, Rensburgspruit and other sites along the Bushman River (), in the present province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, near the town of Weenen. \\"Not a soul was spared.

In addition another 250 or 252 Khoikhoi and Basuto that accompanied the Voortrekkers were killed, bringing the casualties to 532‚Äì534. The murdered included George Biggar, the son of Alexander Biggar, a trader at Port Natal. Biggar and his second son, Robert, subsequently participated and died in retaliatory attacks on the Zulus. Most people camped at the Klein- and Groot-Moordspruit were murdered. Here a Boer woman, Johanna van der Merwe, sustained 21 assegai wounds but survived. The camps at Rensburgspruit, where Hans van Rensburg and Andries Pretorius were camped, successfully defended themselves. Bloukransmonument marking one of the conflict sites Hans van Rensburg's party were compelled to leave their wagons and retreat on foot to a hill, Rensburgkoppie, which was protected by a cliff on one side. Here they were cornered by the Zulus, whom they kept at bay with limited ammunition. When their ammunition was almost exhausted a young man, Marthinus Oosthuizen, arrived on horseback. By shouting instructions they informed him where to locate and salvage ammunition from their camp. This Oosthuizen was able to deliver by charging with his horse through the Zulu file, while covered by the defenders of the hill. With the defense strengthened, the Zulus retreated. Two months afterwards, on 15 April 1838, Andries Pretorius reflected in his journal: \\"As we were separated from one another, they succeeded in their attack at daybreak at Blaauwekrans, thereby killing 33 men, 75 women and 123 children.\\" This implies a total of 231 deaths at the Blaauwekrans camps. The name Blaauwekrans () refers to bluish cliff faces present in the area. Aftermath The Piet Retief Delegation massacre and the Weenen massacre were the motivation for the Voortrekkers to confront the Zulus in battle on 16 December 1838 when 470 Voortrekkers fought against an estimated 15,000 to 21,000 Zulus; which the Voortrekkers won.

The term is also used more generally to describe those who harbour an interest in canals and canal life, but do not actively participate. Etymology \\"Gongoozler\\" may have been canal workers' slang for an observer standing apparently idle on the towpath. Though it was used derisively in the past, today the term is regularly used, perhaps with a little irony, by gongoozlers to describe themselves and their hobby. The word may have arisen from words in Lincolnshire dialect: gawn and gooze, both meaning to stare or gape. It might be presumed that such an expression would date from the nineteenth century, when canals were at their peak, but the word is only recorded from the end of that century or the early twentieth. It was given wider use by the late L. T. C. Rolt, who used it in his book about canal life, Narrow Boat, in 1944. A gawn is also a small ship of lading, such as a working- narrowboat.http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/gawn The term \\"gongoozler\\" may also be used in any circumstance in which people are spectating without contributing to either the content or interest of an event. Aspects of gongoozling Gongoozling, much like trainspotting, is a hobby that can extend to all aspects of canals. =Canal artwork= The collection or creation of canal related artwork is a common pastime amongst gongoozlers. This includes paintings, postcards and photographs. =Canal locks= Canal locks often attract spectators, including gongoozlers, because the operation of manual canal locks is a complex affair, with a number of opportunities for mistakes to be made. Some observers have been known to heckle or harass the boat crews, whilst others carry a lock windlass and actively wish to help boat crews with their passage, by opening the paddles, or helping push open the heavy balance beams on the gates. =Canal history and technology= Whilst trainspotting is commonly associated with identifying engine makes, it is rare for Gongoozlers to do likewise. However an interest can occur for the history of a section of canal, or the operation of locks and alternative devices such as inclined planes, water slopes, and boat lifts with types like the Anderton boat lift, the Falkirk Wheel and the Str√©py-Thieu boat lift. Notable locations The Falkirk Wheel is a popular attraction for gongoozlers Staircase locks, which can hold many boats at once, are very popular amongst gongoozlers, making Foxton Locks on the Leicester Line of the Grand Union Canal an ideal location for gongoozling. Fradley Junction in Staffordshire is a popular place to observe canal traffic, as are many other junctions, due to the occasional need for three boats to pass. The Falkirk Wheel, near Falkirk in Scotland, which connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal, is a huge and spectacular feat of engineering, and attracts very large numbers of gongoozlers. Some locations have become known for their gongoozlers thanks to local events that encourage an increased number of observers. Princess Street lock on the Rochdale Canal in Manchester city centre is normally quite quiet, but it becomes a popular attraction during the Manchester Mardi Gras (which is actually held in late August). The eight locks of Fonserannes on the Canal du Midi in Southern France attract so many gongoozlers that they have become the third most popular tourist attraction in Languedoc.

He was also known as \\"Manco II\\" and \\"Manco C√°pac II\\" (\\"Manqu Qhapaq II\\"). He was one of the sons of Huayna Capac and a younger brother of Huascar.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, Biography =Origin and enthronement= Manco Inca was one of the more than 50 sons of Huayna Capac, probably born in 1515, in Cusco. When Atahualpa's troops took the city under the command of General Quizquiz, they killed the descendants of Huayna Capac, the Huascar supporters, and anyone who could try to take the place of the Inca. Because of this, Manco Inca was forced to flee, avoiding any contact with the atahualpists. On 14 November, 1533, he met the conquistador Francisco Pizarro and his contingent, both Inca and Spanish. This and other events such as the massacre of Atahualpa led Manco Inca to believe that the Spaniards were \\"saviors\\" sent by the gods. T√∫pac Huallpa was a puppet ruler crowned by Francisco Pizarro. After his death, Manco Inca joined Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in Cajamarca. When Pizarro's forces arrived in Cusco, he had the caciques acknowledge Manco as their Inca. Manco Inca then joined Almagro and Hernando de Soto in pursuit of Quizquiz.Pizzaro, P., 1571, Relation of the Discovery and Conquest of the Kingdoms of Peru, Vol. 1‚Äì2, New York: Cortes Society, RareBooksClub.com, When Pizarro left Cuzco with Almagro and Manco Inca, for Jauja in pursuit of Quizquiz, Francisco left his younger brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro as regidores, and a ninety-man garrison in the city. The Pizarro brothers so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately tried to escape in 1535. He failed, was captured and imprisoned. Hernando Pizarro released him to recover a golden statue of his father Huayna Capac. Only accompanied by two Spaniards, he easily escaped a second time. Manco then gathered an army of 200,000 Inca warriors and laid siege to Cusco in early 1536, taking advantage of Diego de Almagro's absence. After ten months (see the siege of Cuzco), Manco retreated to the nearby fortress of Ollantaytambo in 1537. Here Manco successfully defended attacks by the Spaniards in the battle of Ollantaytambo. Manco coordinated his siege of Cusco with one on Lima, led by one of his captains, Quiso Yupanqui. The Incans were able to defeat four relief expeditions sent by Francisco Pizarro from Lima. This resulted in the death of nearly 500 Spanish soldiers. Some Spaniards were captured and sent to Ollantaytambo. Alonso de Alvarado was sent by Pizarro to Cusco, but upon his arrival at Abancay, he and his army were captured by Rodrigo Org√≥√±ez in the Battle of Abancay. This was the beginning of the first civil war between the conquistadors. Abandoning Ollantaytambo (and effectively giving up the highlands of the empire), Manco Inca retreated to Vitcos and finally to the remote jungles of Vilcabamba,Garcilaso De La Vega El Inca, 2006, Royal Commentaries of the Incas and General History of Peru, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., where he founded the Neo-Inca State which lasted until the death of T√∫pac Amaru in 1572. From there, he continued his attacks against the Wankas (one of the most important allies of the Spaniards), having some success after fierce battles, and to the highlands of present-day Bolivia, where after many battles his army was defeated. The Spaniards crowned his younger half brother Paullu Inca as puppet Sapa Inca after his retreat for his valuable help in that last campaign.Titu Cusi Yupanqui, 2005, An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, The Spanish succeeded in capturing Manco's sister-wife, Cura Ocllo, and had her brutally murdered in 1539. =Death= After many guerrilla battles in the mountainous regions of Vilcabamba, Manco was murdered in 1544 in the Inca center of Vitcos by supporters of Diego de Almagro who had previously assassinated Francisco Pizarro and who were in hiding under Manco's protection. They in turn were all killed by Manco's soldiers. Manco was succeeded by his son Sayri Tupaq. Manco Inca had several sons, including Sayri Tupaq, Titu Cusi, and T√∫pac Amaru.

The book was released in 1866 (1867 according to some sources). It is part of the larger tradition of shape note singing. Origin Title page of the 1873 edition William Walker was born in 1809 in South Carolina, and grew up near Spartanburg. He became a Baptist song leader and shape note \\"singing master.\\" Walker and Benjamin Franklin White, publisher of The Sacred Harp, married sisters. In 1835, Walker published a tunebook entitled The Southern Harmony in four-shape (fasola) notation. He incorporated over half of the contents of this Southern Harmony into his Christian Harmony in 1866. For The Christian Harmony, Walker changed from the four-shape system to a seven-shape (doremi) system. Retaining the original four shapes of the Southern Harmony, he devised three other shapes of his own. In defending his change from the four-shape system which he had previously championed, Walker explained that parents wouldn't name seven children with only four names. A second edition was released in 1873. William Walker died on September 24, 1875. Later editions Before the publication of a combined new edition of The Christian Harmony in 2010, two editions were in use - the \\"Carolina book\\" or \\"Walker book,\\" and the \\"Alabama book\\" or \\"Deason book.\\" =Carolina book= The books used in western North Carolina and adjacent areas were 1979, 1994, and 2002 reprints of Walker's 1873 edition of the Christian Harmony. None of the old songs were changed in the new reprint; four songs and some commentary were added. =Alabama book= The \\"Alabama\\" edition was a revision carried out under the leadership of O. A. Parris and John H. Deason and published in 1958. This edition utilized Jesse B. Aikin's seven-shape system; this change was made because Aikin's system was the most common among gospel singers in the South. In addition to changing to the Aikin notation, the 1958 revision deleted some songs and added new ones: > We have removed from the old book 179 songs. These will found to be the > songs very rarely if ever used. We have changed numbers on but 34 songs and > in all cases this was not easily avoidable. On 37 of these songs we have > given them more room in order that they may be more easily read. We have > included 102 songs both old and new that we feel will help very much to make > a better and more useful book. (Preface to 1958 edition) It was used mainly in Alabama and Mississippi. Revisions of the \\"Alabama\\" book were released in 1994, with a few song changes and corrections, and again in 2002. =Combined 2010 edition= The seven-shape Aikin system of notation The 2010 edition contains 672 songs. The book is newly typeset and uses the Aikin seven-shape system. Pages 1‚Äì381 largely reproduce the contents and pagination of the 1958 Alabama book. Pages 397‚Äì541t contain songs present in the Carolina book but omitted by the 1958 revisers, in order (approximately 200 songs). (Pages 388, 393b, and 545b also contain music from the Carolina book, out of order.) Pages 382, 384‚Äì385, 543‚Äì545t, 546‚Äì548, and 549b (the final song in the book) contain new music not included in the Carolina book or in the 1958 Alabama book. The remaining twelve and a half pages consist of songs from the 1958 Alabama book that have been moved for a more spacious layout. Singing communities and traditions In 1933, George Pullen Jackson reported on Christian Harmony singings in four states: South Carolina (in and around Spartanburg and in York, Union, and Greenville counties), North Carolina (Rutherford and Buncombe counties), southern Missouri (a tradition of singings stretching back to 1889), and Alabama (56 singings in 1932 in \\"nine mid-state counties\\"). The publisher, the E.W. Miller Company of Philadelphia, reported sales largely limited to the Spartanburg area at that time. Online minutes record 43 singings from The Christian Harmony in 2010 (12 in North Carolina, nine in Alabama, six in Georgia, six in Virginia, five in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, one in Mississippi, and one in Texas) and 23 singings in 2011 (11 in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, three in Georgia, two in Alabama, and one in Arkansas). Camp DoReMi, a summer singing school in Little Switzerland, North Carolina, is held annually and uses both The Christian Harmony and the New Harp of Columbia. The Newton County, Mississippi, Christian Harmony Convention was organized in 1875 and is believed to be the oldest continuing Christian Harmony convention. This singing has evolved or preserved some distinctive traditional features, such as a sustained ringing style of singing, and the use of \\"The Drone\\" as a closing song. A singing tradition with deep roots continues in Haywood and Transylvania counties, North Carolina. Old Folks Day in Canton has featured singing from the Christian Harmony since the nineteenth century, at the Morning Star Methodist Church, and before that at the Locust Field Church (now the First Baptist Church).Interview with Quay Smathers, 1977 The twice-yearly Etowah singing, now held in Horseshoe, N.C., has been held since 1909.Mabel Y.

Biography Gluck was born as Reba Feinsohn to a Jewish family in Ia»ôi, Romania, the daughter of Zara and Leon Feinsohn. Gluck moved to the United States at a young age. Although her initial success came at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Gluck later concertized widely in America and became an early recording artist. Although various sources claim that her recording of \\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\\" for the Victor Talking Machine Co. was the first celebrity recording by a classical musician to sell one million copies, Victor ledgers do not support the claim‚Äînor did Gluck ever make such a claim herself. It was awarded a gold disc, only the seventh to be granted at that time. Gluck was a founder of the American Woman's Association. Her daughter Marcia Davenport was the child of her first marriage (to Bernard Glick, an insurance man). Gluck later married violinist Efrem Zimbalist and had two children, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (1918‚Äì2014) and Maria. Gluck evidently adopted her professional surname as a variation of her first husband's surname (\\"Glick\\"). Gluck retired to New Hartford, Connecticut, to raise her family in 1925. Although by background an assimilated and nonpracticing Jew who continued to consider herself ethnically Jewish, she found herself attracted, along with her husband Efrem, to Anglican Christianity, and they regularly attended the Episcopal Church in New Hartford. Efrem Jr. and Maria were both christened there, and the couple placed Efrem in an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. Efrem Jr. later became active in evangelical circles and was one of the founders of Trinity Broadcasting Network. Gluck recorded several Christian hymns in duet with Louise Homer, among them \\"Rock of Ages\\", \\"Whispering Hope\\", \\"One Sweetly Solemn Thought\\",; retrieved 2011-04-08 and \\"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\\". After a long illness, she was taken to the Rockefeller Institute Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, but died from liver failure several days later, at 9:30 am on October 27, 1938, at the age of 54.

It is sometimes known as the fairy tern although this name is potentially confusing as it is also the common name of Sternula nereis. Other names for the species include angel tern and white noddy in English, and manu-o-K≈´ in Hawaiian. Taxonomy The white tern was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman in 1786 under the binomial name Sterna alba. The genus Gygis was introduced by the German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The name Gygis is from the Ancient Greek guges for a mythical bird and the specific alba is Latin for \\"white\\". Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the white tern is more closely related to the noddies than it is to the other terns. This implies that \\"white noddy\\" would be a more appropriate English name. The white tern has the following subspecies: *G. a. alba, (Sparrman, 1786): tropical islands of the south Atlantic *G. a. candida, (Gmelin, 1789): Seychelles & Mascarene Islands to central Pacific including southern Maldives excluding ranges of next two subspecies *G. a. microrhyncha, Saunders, 1876: Phoenix, Line and Marquesas Islands *G. a. leucopes, Holyoak & Thibault, 1976: Pitcairn Islands The subspecies G. a. microrhyncha, the little white tern, is sometimes considered as a separate species, Gygis microrhyncha. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that three species are involved, Gygis alba, in the Atlantic Ocean, and Gygis candida and Gygis microrhyncha, both in the Pacific.  Description  The white tern has a wingspan of . It has white plumage and a long black bill.Niethammer, K. R., and L. B. Patrick-Castilaw. 1998. White Tern (Gygis alba). in The Birds of North America, No. 371 (A. Poole and F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. Nesting on coral islands, usually on trees with small branches but also on rocky ledges and on man-made structures, the white tern feeds on small fish which it catches by plunge diving.  Distribution and habitat  The white tern ranges widely across the Pacific Ocean from the coasts of Chile and Colombia to New Zealand and along the eastern and southern coasts of Asia from China to India, South Maldives, the islands of the Indian Ocean, and the coast of South Africa. Rarely it is also found in Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, and on some islands in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a pelagic and epipelagic bird, living along the coast and moving into wooded areas during the breeding season.

Gygis alba MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.131.11.jpg Gygis alba - MHNT  Behavior  This species is notable for laying its egg on bare thin branches in a small fork or depression without a nest. This behaviour is unusual for terns, which generally nest on the ground, and even the related tree-nesting black noddy constructs a nest. It is thought that the reason for the absence of nests is the reduction in nest parasites, which in some colonial seabirds can cause the abandonment of an entire colony. In spite of these benefits there are costs associated with tree nesting, as the eggs and chicks are vulnerable to becoming dislodged by heavy winds. For this reason the white tern is also quick to relay should it lose the egg. The newly hatched chicks have well developed feet with which to hang on to their precarious nesting site. It is a long-lived bird, having been recorded living for 42Hawaii‚Äôs Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy October 1, 2005 years.

The song was released by Grilled Cheese, a subsidiary label of Cargo Music. It was the band's final single with Cargo; \\"Josie\\" was distributed jointly through MCA before they left the label by the end of the year.  Background \\"Dick Lips\\" was written about an experience in Tom DeLonge's high school years, in which he got kicked out of Poway High School during his junior year (1991) after being caught inebriated at a school basketball game. He then attended Rancho Bernardo High School for the remainder of his high school years. \\"Being kicked out of school was bad, but it was also the best thing in my life. Because none of us would be here today,\\" DeLonge said in 2001. \\"Blink-182 is one million percent around today because I got kicked out of school.‚ÄùHoppus, 2001. p. 9 The title has no real significance; it was an insult bandied around the Big Fish Studios while recording, that the band wanted to record \\"for posterity.\\"Shooman, 2010. p. 43‚Äì44 The song largely \\"failed to register\\" on international charts, in part due to the continued success of lead single \\"Dammit\\".Shooman, 2010. p. 45Shooman, 2010. p. 47 Composition The song is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderately fast tempo of 124 beats per minute. DeLonge's vocal range spans from E4 to E5. Reception Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band's best songs, ranked it as number seven, commenting, \\"Without delving into unnecessary details, the lyrics hint at an abusive household and a prospect of romantic longing that serves no purpose beyond the promise of 'something new.'

He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through for the Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. Playing career A power pitcher, Cloninger compiled a career 113‚Äì97 record with 1,120 strikeouts and a 4.07 ERA in 1,767 innings pitched. He enjoyed his best year for the 1965 Braves, with career highs in wins (24), strikeouts (211), ERA (3.29), complete games (16), innings (279) and games started (40). Regarded as a tough fireball pitcher, Cloninger also was a dangerous power hitter. He compiled a career batting average of .192, with 67 RBIs and 11 home runs, including five in the 1966 season. On July 3, 1966, in the Braves' 17‚Äì3 win over the Giants at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Cloninger helped his team's cause with two grand slams and nine RBIs, both of which still stand as Braves franchise single-game bests. Cloninger became the first player in the National League, and remains the only pitcher, to hit two grand slams in the same game. Cloninger used a bat of teammate Denis Menke to hit both of those big home runs, and they stood as the only two grand slams of his major league career. Cloninger finished his career pitching with Cincinnati and St. Louis.

She was one of the original anchors of ESPN2 when it launched in 1993. Three years later, she left ESPN2 to join Fox Sports, and rejoined ESPN in late 1999. Biography =Early life= Kolber was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a Jewish family. She went to Sandy Run Middle School in Dresher, Pennsylvania, and is a 1982 graduate of Pennsylvania's Upper Dublin High School. She graduated from the University of Miami in 1986. Career before ESPN Kolber graduated from the University of Miami in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in telecommunications. While an undergraduate, she worked at Dynamic Cable in Coral Gables, Florida, as a sports director (1984‚Äì86) and was on the UM Water Ski team. After graduation, she worked at CBS Sports in New York City as a videotape coordinator (1986). From 1985 to 1989, Kolber produced the 5:30 p.m. ET sportscast at WTVJ-TV in Miami, winning a local Sports Emmy in 1988. From 1989‚Äì90, she freelanced as a specials producer for WPLG-TV in Miami. In addition, she produced two magazine shows, Greyhound Racing America in Miami, Florida (1988‚Äì90) and Cowboys Special Edition in Irving, Texas (1990‚Äì91). In 1991, Kolber's freelance assignments included work as a reporter/producer for Breeders' Cup Newsfeed in Greenwich, Connecticut; a field producer for Inside Edition in New York City; a sports specials producer for WCIX-TV in Miami, and a producer/director for NFL Films. She was a weekend sports anchor and weekday feature reporter at WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida from December 1991 until she moved to ESPN in 1993. =ESPN= Suzy Kolber has covered a variety of assignments for ESPN from the National Football League to the 1996 ESPN X Games bicycle-stunt events and Grand Slam tennis events. She is most recognized as a sideline reporter on ESPN‚Äôs Monday Night Football with Michele Tafoya. In 2007, she was also a host for ESPN‚Äôs pre-race NASCAR Countdown program. Kolber joined ESPN‚Äôs MNF team during its inaugural year in 2006 after five previous seasons on ESPN's Sunday Night Football (2001‚Äì05). As a member of the MNF team, Kolber helped the longtime franchise become the most-watched program in cable television history. Kolber worked the ABC Sports broadcast of Super Bowl XL in Detroit in 2006 with Michele Tafoya and contributed to the network‚Äôs pre-game show. She also became the first female recipient of the Maxwell Club Sports Broadcaster of the Year Award in 2006 and was named to Sports Business Daily‚Äôs 2004 list of the 10 favorite sports TV personalities of the past 10 years. Kolber regularly hosts ESPN‚Äôs year-round NFL Live news and information show, and she has played a major role in ESPN‚Äôs comprehensive coverage of the annual NFL Draft, hosting the Day 2 telecast (2004‚Äì2006) and leading analysis segments on Day 1. For the 1999 through 2003 NFL seasons, Kolber was the host of NFL Matchup. She also previously contributed ‚ÄúBackstage‚Äù segments to Monday Night Countdown. During the NFL off-season, Kolber serves as an anchor on SportsCenter and as an on-site and studio host for ESPN‚Äôs tennis coverage at the French Open (since 2004‚Äì2006) and Wimbledon (since 2003‚Äì2006/2009). In 1996, 2000 and 2001, she hosted the Summer X Games and Winter X Games, and she co-hosted the event again in Aspen in 2006. She also hosted horse racing events including all three legs of the Triple Crown for ESPN/ESPN2 studio programs. Kolber returned to ESPN in August 1999 after originally joining the network in 1993 as co-host for ESPN2‚Äôs SportsNight, when the network debuted October 1 of that year. She later served as an anchor on SportsCenter, a reporter on College GameDay and co-host of the X Games in 1995 and 1996. Kolber also hosted ESPN2's SportsFigures, which uses sports celebrities and analogies to teach math and physics. While covering the 2011 NFL Draft, Kolber came under fire for her interview with Mark Ingram Jr., who started to sob when Kolber read an e-mail from Ingram's imprisoned father. The interview was perceived by some as being manipulative. On Tuesday, September 13, 2011, the ESPN2 debut of the show NFL32 with Suzy Kolber and Chris Mortensen hit the air. With a backdrop similar to a sports bar (complete with wainscoting, sports memorabilia, and dark woodwork), the show focuses on \\"dissect the biggest topics of the day from all 32 NFL teams\\" and attributes much of its design to that of the Dan Patrick Show, a well listened to and watched national radio and television show on DirecTV's Audience network. The Namath incident On December 20, 2003, Kolber received national attention when, covering a New York Jets game, former Jets quarterback Joe Namath twice stated, in a nationally televised sideline interview with Kolber, that he wanted to kiss her, and \\"couldn't care less about the team strugg-a- ling.\\" Kolber responded, \\"Thanks, Joe. I'll take that as a huge compliment.\\" Namath later apologized and blamed the incident on his obvious intoxication. Soon after, Namath entered an outpatient alcoholism treatment program. Namath chronicled the episode, including his battle with alcoholism in his book, Namath and later said that remembering the embarrassment he felt after the interview aired helped him maintain a lasting sobriety. Monday Night Football Kolber joined ESPN's Monday Night Football crew as a sideline reporter along with Michele Tafoya when the network took over the longtime football series from ABC Sports in 2006. After Tafoya left ESPN for NBC Sports at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 NFL season, ESPN used a rotating solo sideline reporter for the 2011‚Äì2012 NFL season, with reporters such as Wendi Nix, Ed Werder and Rachel Nichols stepping into the role each week, with Kolber as a fill-in. Kolber requested to do more in-studio work so she didn't have to be away from her child. The show NFL32 (now NFL Insiders) was created as a result of this request. Lisa Salters was named the new full-time solo sideline reporter for Monday Night Football starting with the 2012‚Äì2013 NFL season, effectively ending Kolber's tenure as sideline reporter for the show, although both Salters and Kolber continue to co-produce the show in some capacity. NASCAR Countdown In the two weeks prior to Kolber's arrival in 2007, Brent Musburger was mysteriously absent from his position as lead host of NASCAR Countdown on the ABC/ESPN network. On the week of the race on May 19, ESPN gave no reason for his absence but announced Kolber as the new host of Nextel Cup and Busch Series studio programming. She was subsequently replaced by Allen Bestwick as host of NASCAR Countdown. Monday Night Countdown After substituting for the then-ailing Stuart Scott during most of the 2014 NFL season, Kolber took over Scott's role permanently as an on-site host of Monday Night Countdown, starting with the 2015 NFL season, after Scott died on January 4, 2015. =Fox Sports= Kolber left ESPN for Fox Sports in November 1996, where she anchored Fox Sports News for the fledgling Fox Sports Net and reported from NFL games, among other duties. She served as the lead reporter for the network's coverage of the NFL on Fox teaming up with the network's No. 1 announcer team of Pat Summerall and John Madden for one game in 1998. She also covered horse racing. She served as studio host for the network's coverage of the NHL on Fox, including both the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals and the Playoffs. In March 1999, Kolber co-hosted a Fox non-sports presentation with Maury Povich, Opening the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt, an archaeological event that promised to \\"unveil five-thousand year old mysteries.\\" Fox's TV cameras showed the first live excavation on Egypt's ancient Giza plateau; Kolber reported live from the tomb. She returned to ESPN in August 1999. =Endorsements= Kolber's football broadcast narrative is featured on Sega's video game, ESPN NFL Football for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2. Kolber also is a national television spokesperson for Chevrolet and Pepsi-Cola commercials. In 1995's ESPN Extreme Games for PlayStation, she has multiple video sequences hyping up the player, introducing levels, and hinting at secret areas. The re-release of the game, 1eXtreme, removed all of her videos, and any reference to ESPN.

It also promotes flavor development through frictional heat, release of volatiles and acids, and oxidation. There are numerous designs of conches. Food scientists are still studying precisely what happens during conching and why. The name arises from the shape of the vessels initially used which resembled conch shells. When ingredients are mixed in this way, sometimes for up to 78 hours, chocolate can be produced with a mild, rich taste. Lower-quality chocolate is conched for as little as 6 hours. Since the process is so important to the final texture and flavor of chocolate, manufacturers keep the details of their conching process proprietary.McClements, D. Julian Understanding and Controlling the Microstructure of Complex Foods, Woodhead Publishing, 2007, , page 654. Rodolphe Lindt invented the \\"conche\\" in Berne, Switzerland, in 1879. It produced chocolate with superior aroma and melting characteristics compared to other processes used at that time. The Lindt chocolate company states that Lindt (perhaps mistakenly) allowed a mixer containing chocolate running over a weekend (or possibly overnight, according to other variants of the possibly- apocryphal story). Upon returning to the device, Lindt recognised the final product to have different properties to conventionally-produced chocolate at the time, with a less granular texture and greater shine than conventional chocolate at the time lacked, being generally \\"gritty\\" when solidified owing to the presence of non-ideal cocoa butter crystals. Lindt's invention made the mass-production of chocolate bars more practical, eventually replacing chocolate beverages as the primary means of mass chocolate consumption.Talbot, Geoff (ed), Science and Technology of Enrobed and Filled Chocolate, Confectionery and Bakery Products, Woodhead Publishing, 2009, , chapter 2.5 Conching. Lindt's original conche consisted of a granite roller and granite trough; such a configuration is now called a \\"long conche\\" and can take more than a day to process a tonne of chocolate. The ends of the trough were shaped to allow the chocolate to be thrown back over the roller at the end of each stroke, increasing the surface area exposed to air. A modern rotary conche can process 3 to 10 tonnes of chocolate in less than 12 hours. Modern conches have cooled jacketed vessels containing long mixer shafts with radial arms that press the chocolate against vessel sides. A single machine can carry out all the steps of grinding, mixing, and conching required for small batches of chocolate. Conching process Hershey conche from the early 1900s, on display as part of the Hershey Story collection Conching redistributes the substances from the dry cocoa that create flavor into the fat phase. Air flowing through the conche removes some unwanted acetic, propionic, and butyric acids from the chocolate and reduces moisture. A small amount of moisture greatly increases viscosity of the finished chocolate, so machinery is cleaned with cocoa butter instead of water.Ranken, M. D.; Kill, R. C.; Baker, C. G. J. (ed.), Food Industries Manual (24th Edition), Springer-Verlag, 1997, , pages 438‚Äì439. Some of the substances produced in roasting of cocoa beans are oxidized in the conche, mellowing the flavor of the product. The temperature of the conche is controlled and varies for different types of chocolate. Generally, higher temperature leads to a shorter required processing time. Temperature varies from around for milk chocolate to up to for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction.Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa, Chocolate Science and Technology, John Wiley and Sons, 2010, , pages 43, 65‚Äì66. The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the conche removes some moisture and volatile substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor. Moisture balance affects the flavor and texture of the finished product because, after the particles are coated with fat, moisture and volatile chemicals are less likely to escape. In the pasty phase more of the particles are coated with the fats from the cocoa. The power required to turn the conche shafts increases at this step. The final liquid phase allows minor adjustment to the viscosity of the finished product by addition of fats and emulsifiers, depending on the intended use of the chocolate. While most conches are batch-process machines, continuous-flow conches separate the stages with weirs, over which the product travels through separate parts of the machine. A continuous conche can reduce the conching time for milk chocolate to as little as four hours.

They include his 36 Verdi Transcriptions, written between 1972 and 2005. Finnissy is concerned with the political aspects of music, and he believes that all music is 'programmatic' to some degree, that is, a composition exists in not just the composer's mind, but inside a culture that reflects both the extra-musical and purely musical concerns of the composer. Music, far from being unable to express anything other than itself (as Stravinsky said) is a force for change. This engagement with political and social themes became more frequent as his career progressed. For example, the influence of homosexual themes and concerns began to enter his work; as in Shameful Vice in 1994, and more explicitly in Seventeen Immortal Homosexual Poets in 1997.

Origins and influences Drew Hayes' work was influenced by Dungeons & Dragons, Elfquest, and Cerebus.From the forward to \\"Poison Elves: The Mulehide Years\\" trade. Lusiphur was originally one of Hayes' Dungeons & Dragons characters. The book version of the character was based on Lux Interior of The Cramps, Glenn Danzig of The Misfits, and Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy. Publication history I, Lusiphur (December 1991-December 1992) - Poison Elves (February 1993-February 1995) Hayes originally self-published the series during the early 90s under his company Mulehide Graphics under the title of I, Lusiphur. The title was changed to Poison Elves because the similarity of Lusiphur to Lucifer led to the misconception that the series was Satanic in nature. Sales were reported to have increased significantly after the name change.The foreword to the \\"Traumatic Dogs\\" Collected Edition Drew claimed in one of his Starting Notes that the name change was prompted by a letter from a teen-aged fan whose mother had thrown out his comics after finding I, Lusiphur comics amongst his collection. The first ten issues of the Mulehide series were published in a larger magazine size format. In 1995, Drew Hayes signed on with Sirius Entertainment, a move that increased his exposure, fan base, and publishing rate. To date, twelve trade paperbacks have been released, stopping at issue #75. However, the last issue of the main series published by Sirius was #79. Hayes died in 2007, thus bringing the series to an abrupt end. A commemorative issue #80 was released to give fans a look at sketches and plans Drew Hayes had for the future of the series before his death. A continuation of the original series, Drew Hayes Poison Elves #1 [March 2013], published by Ape Entertainment and based on Hayes' outline for future issues, picks up almost precisely at the cliffhanger point at the end of issue #79 .Back For The Attack: The Return of Poison Elves, interview with Robb Horan Only 3 issues were published before the series abruptly endedRobb Horan image post in the Poison Elves Facebook group which was possibly connected to David Hedgecock, Ape Entertainment CEO leaving the company to join IDW Publishing.Hedgecock joins IDW as Managing Editor 10/29/2013, by Heidi MacDonald in The Beat An unknown number of completed issues remain unpublished.  Background and setting  Amrahly'nn, the world of Poison Elves, is one where magic and technology meet. An example of this is Lusiphur's magical semi-automatic handgun that never runs out of bullets. Hayes had described the world as \\"...a mix of Tolkien's Middle Earth and the Neo-Romantic world seen in the Adam and the Ants video for 'Stand and Deliver'\\". =Characters=  Lusiphur  Lusiphur, originally named Luis Amerillis Malach√©, was found by a married elven couple in the Carpathian forest in 1380. He grew up in their inn in Port Sarnwog. However, his childhood was an unhappy one after a drunken patron set fire to their establishment leaving his adoptive parents desperate for money. His father sank into depression and was later killed in one of the city's violent class wars. With nowhere left to turn, his mother was forced to enter into the only profession she could, prostitution. In 1390, things took a turn for the worse when an abusive client battered Luse's mother. She escaped without being beaten to death, but in her hurry, she stepped on a nail. The wound became infected and gangrene soon spread, crippling her and leaving her bedridden indefinitely. Her Elvin immune system prevented her from dying, prolonging her suffering until she begged a young Luse to end her suffering. With no money for a doctor or medicine, the young elf had little choice. He slit her wrists with a razor blade to set her free from the suffering. The image of her death would haunt Luse for the rest of his life. The orphaned Luse learned to survive on the streets alone where he adopted a new identity which he uses today, Lusiphur Malach√©. He spent his younger years working for a crime lord called The Nick, where he was involved in risky heists. During this tumultuous time in his life, he met and fell in love with the beautiful priestess Elf, Lirilith. However, he was unable to leave the gang and the continuing life of crime drove the young lovers apart. (This part of Lusiphur's life is chronicled in the mini series, Lusiphur and Lirilith written by Drew Hayes and illustrated by Jason Shawn Alexander).Davidson, Keith J.

He makes use of a lamp, with the subsequent genie, that he received after trading the dead body of a Doppleganger to his ex-wife, Hyena. After a failed attempt to ask for a million wishes, he settles on three: A powerful Elven sword named Cinlach, super speed to get out of the desert, and the \\"well of souls,\\" an assassin tool. Genie gives him the wishes. But to give them, she has to take them from somewhere. Cinlach comes from an Elven Warduke named Ailwon Sann Fenlach, who quickly notices it missing. He is a veteran of many long-ago wars against the Orcs even if age and time have worn down his fighting acumen. Sann Fenlach has his mage transport him to Lusiphur's location in the desert where he challenges the elf to a duel for stealing his property. At first the Fenlach is winning, due in part to his mage immediately fixing any wounds Lusiphur can inflict. The turning point comes when a magician named Tenth steps in. Tenth was quietly reading in his study when he felt a temporary shock. The genie drained his power to accommodate Lusiphur's request for super speed. Tenth also pinpoints where Lusiphur is located and sees that he is currently fighting Sann Fenlach. He also sees the disparity in the fight. Lusiphur is a young but experienced assassin, having to fight for everything he ever had. The High Lord is sedentary, fighting his last significant battle hundreds of years ago. In the meantime he has been sitting on his throne recounting past battles. Tenth sees that he is relying too much on the magical connection and severs it. After Lushiphur defeats the High Lord when the odds are more even, he starts burying the body. Tenth then arrives to take back the small sliver of power that Lusiphur took from him. Tenth wants it to be a fair contest however. Lusiphur could best Tenth in a physical contest and Tenth could destroy Lusiphur quickly if he chose. The wizard has not had a challenge in a while, and so decides to make a sport of it. In \\"Tenth's Game,\\" the Elf is given a fighting chance: Make it across 50 meters through an arch. If he does he will survive. His only weapon is a temporary power of shape-changing into animals given to him by Tenth. The wizard promises to only use his shape-changing powers in return. The two play a cat- and-mouse game, Lusiphur at one point turning into panther-like creature to fend off Tenth who had become a hawk. Tenth turns to a fly, so Lusiphur turns to a rattle snake, but he cannot figure out how to move a rattlesnake. This was when Tenth turns to a Unicorn, causing Lusiphur to panic and he chose a Nightmare (A black batwinged unicorn that bleeds acid and breathes fire.) Tenth becomes a Drake, where as Lusiphur turns to a black Dragon, knocking Tenth into a mountain. After recovering Tenth becomes a gold dragon, the two fight. Lusiphur gets his teeth on Tenth's throat. Up to this point in his existence Tenth has thoroughly beaten any competitor. Lusiphur has made the wizard fear for his life for the first time in many years. The dragon battle drags on, until Lusiphur disappears. Tenth assumes he is dead and scans the ground for his body. As Tenth searches for Lusiphur's body, he tries to go through the gate as a dragon, but he finds he can't fit. So Tenth becomes a Hell hound and goes through the gate, the moment he crosses it, Lusiphur appears out of nowhere and nearly carves Tenth's heart out. Lusiphur had become a flea and let Tenth carry him through the gate.

Character and Life  A very popular and dynamic personality, he later became a diplomat and was sent from the Japanese embassy in London to Iraq where he was killed by unknown assailants with his colleague Masamori Inoue and their Iraqi driver when their car was ambushed on 29 November 2003. He was promoted posthumously to ambassador in recognition of his work by the Japanese foreign ministry (Gaimusho). Katsuhiko Oku made a point of visiting many countries and finding out what the local people wanted. He saw it as the first duty of a diplomat. Since 2004 an Oku Memorial Trophy has been contested annually in Richmond, London by the Kew Occasionals club (founded by Katsu Oku's good friend Reg Clark), London Japanese RFC and some Japanese teams. (See RFU's official newspaper Touchline, February 2007 issue).  Charitable fund  A charitable fund has been set up in his name for the children of Iraq and a collection at the 2004 Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match went towards that fund. Proceeds from the recent game in Japan between Waseda and Oxford (which Waseda won for the first time ever) also went to the fund, and the game was called the Katsuhiko Oku Memorial match. It was played on 20 September 2004 and Waseda won 25-9. The average weight of the forwards was Oxford 107 kg, Waseda 99 kg. The record now stands at one win, one draw and ten losses.

He was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania and lived on a farm in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Aikin, a member of the Church of the Brethren, was the first to successfully produce a song book (The Christian Minstrel) with a seven-shape note system, in 1846. He vigorously defended his \\"invention\\" and his patent, which included the elimination of bass and treble clefs and the simplification of time signatures. After the influential Ruebush & Kieffer Publishing Company began using his notehead shapes around 1876 (previously they used Funk's shapes), the Aikin shapes eventually became the prevailing standard in shape note and gospel music publication, although few other compilers adopted his other innovations. Aikin's names for the notes were originally written: Doe Ray Mee Faw Sole Law See. All the note stems pointed downwards, and the stems for Doe, Ray, and See were placed centrally on the shape, rather than to the side. These conventions were discarded by later users of his system, so as not to deviate so much from standard notation. The name See was also changed to Ti (as used in the Tonic sol-fa system), so as not to be confused with a sharpened Sol. Today Aikin's system is still in use, though it is often referred to as the Aiken system, a spelling error introduced by George Pullen Jackson and perpetuated by the Sibelius music notation program.

Background An old Yorkville family, the Stollerys owned a famous furnishings store named Stollery's, which opened in 1901 in downtown Toronto. Peter Stollery, the founder‚Äôs grandson, worked on and off at the haberdashery for 24 years, first as a furnishings‚Äô man and eventually as a manager from 1965 to 1968 after his father, Alan Stollery, died suddenly. His attachment to these roots explain his later designation in the Senate of Canada as Senator for \\"Bloor and Yonge\\", the intersection at which the store was located. Before entering public life, Stollery also worked as a teacher in Algeria and travel writer for Maclean's. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and a Member of the National Liberal Club in London. Career in Parliament Stollery was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal candidate in the 1972 election for Spadina riding in Toronto defeating incumbent MP Perry Ryan who had left the Liberals and crossed the floor to the Progressive Conservatives. He was re-elected in the 1974, 1979 and 1980 elections. He served for a time as chairman of the Liberal Caucus (1976‚Äì1978), and as parliamentary secretary to the Secretary of State and to the Minister of Communications (1980‚Äì1981). In 1981, Stollery was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau wanted to open Stollery's Spadina riding so his aide James Coutts could be elected to Parliament in a by-election.By-election in Spadina to Tories‚Äô advantage, Trudeau tells Commons, by Marina Strauss, The Globe and Mail, July 4, 1981. The voters rebelled, and in the subsequent by- election Coutts was defeated in what had been a safe Liberal seat by Dan Heap of the New Democratic Party. He retired from the Senate on November 29, 2010 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, at which point he had served in Parliament for over 38 years, including more than 29 years in the Senate. In the Senate, Stollery served on several committees. His deep-seated interest in international affairs and humanitarian aid have led him to take part in numerous overseas delegations and to assume the position of Chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs (1999‚Äì2005).Out of their depth in Africa, by Carol Goar, Toronto Star, February 23, 2007. He continued to serve on the committee as Vice-Chair until his retirement from the Senate. He has been involved with the Canada-Europe Interparliamentary Union. Controversy On May 29, 2006 during a session of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence, Stollery criticized Hamid Karzai, then President of Afghanistan. Although Karzai was democratically elected, Stollery implied that Karzai's ascent to power was due to US influence.Senator calls Afghan president Karzai a 'stooge' by Mike Blanchfield, CanWest News Service (reprinted by the Saskatchewan Star Phoenix), May 30, 2006. He argued that Canadian troops could be better used to help ‚Äúcreate a democratic society in Afghanistan‚Äù.Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence, May 29, 2006. In September 2006, Stollery added that the limited presence of Canadian troops on the African continent was a result of military officials believing it was not as \\"sexy\\" as helping the U.S. by fighting in Afghanistan. He was subsequently criticized by Liberal Senator Rom√©o Dallaire, who called Stollery's comments \\"scandalous language.\\" Dallaire stated that \\"Nothing is sexy in war.

Biography  She was born in Darmstadt. After her mother's early death, she was sent to the Kaiserin-Augusta-Stift, a very strict boarding school in Potsdam. In this institution, the girls of the aristocracy were drilled to learn discipline and submission. After leaving school, she married Baron Ludwig Hatvany (1880-1961), a rich Hungarian writer and landowner. While married to Hatvany, Winsloe wrote Das M√§dchen Manuela (\\"The Child Manuela\\"), a short novel based on her experiences at Kaiserin-Augusta. Soon after, her marriage broke up, but Hatvany made her a generous allowance after their divorce. That novel was released in 1933. Winsloe was involved in a relationship with newspaper reporter Dorothy Thompson, probably before World War II when Thompson was reporting from Berlin.Lewis, Jone Johnson. \\"Dorothy Thompson Quotes.\\" Women's History About. 2010. About.com, Web. 7 Mar 2010. . Winsloe then wrote the stage play Gestern und heute (literally \\"Yesterday and Today\\"). The original title was rejected as too insipid, so the play was renamed Ritter N√©restan (literally: \\"Knight N√©restan\\") when it appeared in 1930 in Leipzig. When it was brought to Berlin, it was renamed again to Krankheit der Liebe (lit. \\"Sickness of Love\\"). In 1932, her play was performed as \\"Children in Uniform\\" (English adaptation by Barbara Burnham) at the Duchess Theatre in London with Cathleen Nesbitt and Jessica Tandy in the cast. The play's success led to the production of the film M√§dchen in Uniform (1931); Winsloe was one of the screenwriters. M√§dchen in Uniform was a considerable success, both financially and critically. This was due to its ambitiously aesthetic form and the fact that only women performed in it. The lesbian aspect of the story was downplayed and depicted as an adolescent crush, even though Winsloe co- authored the script, and Leontine Sagan, who in the play had stressed the lesbian aspect, acted as director. The play ends differently from the film. In the play, the young student, Manuela, is destroyed because of rejection by her teacher, Fr√§ulein Elizabeth von Bernburg, who did not dare to side with Manuela against the headmistress or oppose the brutal educational methods. Manuela commits suicide. The film is more ambiguous, with von Bernburg attempting to defend the student and herself. Christa Winsloe may be recorded as having written the first detailed play on lesbianism in the Weimar Republic. On the strength of the play's acclaim, Winsloe moved to Berlin, where there was a lesbian sub-culture. She had plenty of money (from her ex- husband's allowance), worked as an animal sculptor, and had a wide circle of friends. She was a member of the SPD (the German Social Democrats, then largely reform Marxist in orientation), and was open about her sexuality. She moved to France in the late 1930s, fleeing the Nazis. During World War II, she joined the French Resistance. Contrary to what is often stated, she was not executed by the Nazis. Instead, on 10 June 1944, Winsloe and her French partner, Simone Gentet, were shot and killed by four Frenchmen in a forest near the country town of Cluny. The exact reason why she and Gentet were killed was never fully clarified, but presumably they were falsely suspected to be Nazi spies by the Frenchmen.Doris Hermanns: Meerkatzen, Mei√üel und das M√§dchen Manuela.

In his books, Brown claims that, from the age of seven, he and his childhood friend Rick were trained in tracking and wilderness survival by Rick's grandfather, \\"Stalking Wolf\\" (whom Brown claims was Lipan Apache).King, Thomas, \\"Dead Indians: Too Heavy to Lift\\" in Hazlitt, November 30, 2012.

Stalking Wolf, by the way, was supposedly born in 1873, wandered the Americas in search of spiritual truths, and finally passed all his knowledge on to Tom Brown Jr., a seven- year-old white boy whom he met in New Jersey. Evidently, Tom Brown Jr., or his prot√©g√©s, run the workshops, having turned Stalking Wolf‚Äôs teachings into a Dead Indian franchise.\\" There is no evidence that \\"Stalking Wolf\\" ever existed.James Osborne, \\"Tracker gains big following even as some say tales stray\\" (Phillynews, June 26, 2011) Brown writes that Stalking Wolf died when Brown was 17, and that Rick was killed in a motorcycle riding accident in Europe shortly thereafter.Tom Brown Jr., The Tracker (Penguin Books, 1978,'86) Brown spent the next ten years working odd jobs to support his wilderness adventures.Rakoff, David, Fraud (Doubleday, 2001) p.188 He then set out to find other people in New Jersey who were interested in his experiences. Initially Brown met with little success, but was eventually called on to help locate a crime suspect.Mary Vespa, \\"Tracker Tom Brown Finds Himself Up to His Ears in Trouble Stalking Crime Through the Woods\\" (People, March 27, 1978) Though the case won him national attention, the authorities were subsequently sued for 5 million dollars for finding the wrong person. Despite this failure, he was able to build on this exposure to develop a profession as a full-time tracker, advertising his services for locating lost persons, dangerous animals, and fugitives from the law.Terry Krautwurst, \\"The Tom Brown School Wilderness Training\\" (Mother Earth News, Mar-Apr 1988) According to People magazine, \\"He stalks men and animals, mostly in New Jersey.\\" The Tracker School Tom Brown Jr.'s Tracker School is located in New Jersey. Most classes offered by Tracker School are held in \\"Primitive Camp\\", which is located in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. However, classes are also offered in California. Workshops involve Brown's versions of Plains Indian ceremonies, including the sweat lodge and vision quest. Personal life In July 1977 Tom Brown Jr. married Judy Duck Ford, 33.

It stretches across the border between Arizona and Nevada. Originally called Bullhead Dam, Davis Dam was renamed after Arthur Powell Davis, who was the director of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation from 1914 to 1923. The United States Bureau of Reclamation owns and operates the dam, which was completed in 1951. Davis Dam impounds the Colorado River and forms Lake Mohave. Description Aerial view of Davis Dam and Lake Mohave. ;Davis Dam Davis Dam is a zoned earth-fill dam with a concrete spillway, in length at the crest, and high. The earth fill dam begins on the Nevada side, but it does not extend to the Arizona side on the east. Instead, there is an inlet formed by earth and concrete, that includes the spillway. The hydroelectric power plant is beside the inlet. The dam's purpose is to re-regulate releases from Hoover Dam upstream, and facilitate the delivery of Colorado River water to Mexico. Bullhead City, Arizona, and Laughlin, Nevada, are located just below the dam along the river. Davis Camp is also nearby. Bullhead City was originally a construction town for workers building the dam. A road is located on the crest of the earth fill portion of the dam and a Forebay Bridge spans the Forebay. It was formerly part of Arizona State Route 68 to Nevada. In April 2004, the roadway was shut down to vehicle traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. The old roadway is now an extension of the Heritage Trail system. Barriers have been placed on the former road at each end of the earthen dam. The facility is heavily patrolled by security forces who strictly enforce parking regulations. ;Davis Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant The Davis Dam Power Plant is a hydroelectric power plant located on the Arizona side of the dam, beside the inlet. The hydroelectric plant generates between 1 and 2 terawatt- hours of electricity annually. The plant has a capacity of and the tops of its five Francis turbines are visible from outside the plant.

In application to motor skills of hands (and fingers) the term dexterity is commonly used. According to a study done in the UK it was observed that females between the age of 4 and 7 years old show finer motor skills compared to males of the same age. This was discovered by putting 100+ females and 100+ males through observation and having them complete a variety of fine motor skills and then grading them on each skill. They then proceeded to take the total of the grades given for the skills observed and found that females tended to have finer motor skills than males. This could potentially be due to stereotypes since young girls are generally known to color or play with small dolls which both would require fine motor skills, but this has yet to be proven. The abilities which involve the use of hands develop over time, starting with primitive gestures such as grabbing at objects to more precise activities that involve precise eye‚Äìhand coordination. Fine motor skills are skills that involve a refined use of the small muscles controlling the hand, fingers, and thumb. The development of these skills allows one to be able to complete tasks such as writing, drawing, and buttoning. When the child enters middle childhood they make great progress in their artistic abilities. They begin to express themselves through drawing, sculpting, and clay modeling. Self-care skills As children refine their motor skills, they are able to help themselves by completing daily activities independently. For example, children between the ages of 2 and 3 are able to put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing.Craig, G., Kermis, M. & Digdon, N. (2001) Children today, 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall: Toronto They are able to manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they are able to manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and are able to copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children are able to dress and undress themselves without assistance. They are also able to manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child is able to cut softer foods with a knife and is able to tie their own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, the ages given are not an exact timeline. Writing skills It is critical to understand the development of children's fine motor skills to understand the reasoning behind why they complete certain tasks in a certain way. For example, it is important to understand the development of fine motor skills when a paper is handed in by a child in grade one and the writing is large, malformed, with little evidence of control of the pencil. If the teacher were to know the stages that children go through to develop these skills, then they may be more considerate and provide the child with appropriate adaptations to help them improve their writing skills. Also, as children refine their motor skills, they are able to communicate by written expression. Starting off with scribbling and moving on to printing and writing. Sometimes children need some assistance when developing their fine motor skills. This requires one to find strategies to assist children with their development. Occupational therapists are experts in the field of fine motor and handwriting development. More exposure to physical activity is known to be the most efficient method for developing any skill. Girls at the age of four tend to use their fine motor skills more effectively than boys at the same age. Similarly, boys tend to have better control of gross motor skills. There are three stages in holding a writing implement in early childhood. The first stage involves all four fingers and thumb wrapped around pencil in a fist. The seconds stage is the palm-down hand position. The third and final stage is presented around age 7 and there is upright position, trunk and hand stability, hand is positioned in line with the forearm, and the forward lean of the trunk. Parental involvement can influence the stage of writing within their child. Parents who are more involved in their child's learning process, will see significant improvements in their child's accuracy and clarity. Those children who are exposed to the support of their parents will develop more proficient fine motor skills. Children‚Äôs drawings Children‚Äôs drawings also develop as a child ages and refines their fine motor skills. This has been widely studied, especially by Rhoda Kellogg (1898‚Äì1987), following children from 2 years to 8 years of age. Her research has found that the artistic gestures of children evolve from basic scribbles to consistent symbols. The first symbols that are formed by children are the circle, the upright cross, the diagonal cross, the rectangle, and other common forms. When the child is 3 years old, they begin to form face shapes and by age 4, humans. At 4 to 5 years old, the child draws a human form with arms and legs, and eventually the child adds a trunk and clothes. Children then evolve to include other pictorials in their art, such as houses, animals and boats, by the age of 5. =Manipulative materials= Toys that require a child to manipulate it with their fingers and hands can be categorized as a manipulative. Manipulatives involve coordinating the eye to what the hands are needed to do. They stimulate fine motor development because they require controlled use of hand and finger muscles. Some manipulative toys, such as puzzles, are self-correcting, fitting together in only one specific way. These types of toys only fit together one way and allow children to work until they achieve success.Essa, E., Young, R. & Lehne, L. (1998) Introduction to early childhood education, 2nd Ed. Nelson: Toronto Play dough is a manipulative that can help strengthen a child's fine motor skills. Dough can be rolled into balls, tooth picks can be used to create designs in the dough, and plastic knives can be used to cut the dough (with supervision). =Eye-Coordination= \\"Any of the manipulative activities requiring utensils develop eye-hand coordination. Constructing with Legos, blocks, or popsicle sticks builds eye-hand coordination. Balancing objects such as blocks requires precise hand motions.Other precision motor activities include playing the piano, playing with a cash register, pushing buttons, typing, working puzzles, stringing beads, weaving, and sewing. Even large muscle activities such as climbing a ladder, playing Simon Says, and jumping rope help build eye-hand coordination (Lamme, 1979, p. 21).\\" [6.] =Modified writing materials= Other ways to assist children with their fine motor development are to use modified tools to assist them. For young children, using crayons is often difficult at first due to their small size, so it is important to provide children with a tool that they are able to manipulate. There have been crayons created that are a tetrahedral shape, so that the children are able to grab the crayon in any position. The use of these crayons allows for a child to create a more precise picture because of the control they have and this also helps the child to pursue such personal expression, since they are not being frustrated by not being able to use the tools. Children, when they are learning to print, also experience some frustrations. A way to assist a child who is having difficulties with this is to provide them with a Primer pencil (which is thicker around) or to modify a pencil by adding to its circumference (either by a formed grip or by adding tape). For a child who is having difficulties with their fine motor skills, offering tools such as larger pencils and modified pencils will help the child develop a better grasp of this tool and eventually moving to smaller, regular size pencils. This will help with their self-esteem, providing them with a sense of accomplishment in writing tasks. =Positioning= Another way to assist a child who is having difficulties developing their fine motor skills is to provide the child with proper positioning of their hands and body to accomplish tasks. As motor skills develop, children's hand grip positioning changes as well. Their grip starts off with a palmar supinate grasp. This grasp involves wrapping the entire hand around the implement used in the shape of a fist with the palm facing upwards. Children then progress to a digital pronate grasp in which they hold the implement with their palm facing downward. The pronate grasp involves using the middle finger and thumb. Children at this stage are able to use their thumb for tactile prehension. This stage can be mastered by the age of 2‚Äì4 years old. They then progress to a static tri-posture grasp and then to a dynamic tripod grasp as their fingers and thumb start to play more of a function. Over time, their hands will begin to move closer to the tip of the implement used, allowing for more precise control over movement technique. The refinement in position in which they hold the writing utensil goes from holding it from the top to the bottom (closer to the tip).  Possible predictor for better cognitive skills  Children who show a better grasp of fine motor skills are shown to have a better outcomes in certain topics in academics. In a study, children who had a better grasp of motor skills were able to score higher on the topics of mathematics and phonological awareness. Although there isn't enough conclusive evidence on how much motor skills affect the academic performance of children, there is a possible correlation between the ability to perform advanced motor skills as a child and an increase in ability for cognitive skills such as problem solving.  Illness and fine motor skills in later life  People who have suffered from a stroke or have suffered a neck injury (maybe as a result of a car accident) may have impaired fine motor skills, making it difficult for them to write or to use a computer mouse. An affected individual might find that a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist can provide a rehabilitation program or recommend environmental adaptations to improve the use of their fine motor skills.

The population in 2011 was 901,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 28.22 km2.Eurostat History Situated on relatively flat land with fertile soils, although situated far from major population centres, the region was settled early, sometime before the year 1480. Owing to the severity of the coast, access to this region was obtained from the port of Biscoitos, some east, and from the early settlement along the ravines of Quatro Ribeiras. The clearing and logging that proceeded along the territory, and from the agrarian structure and morphology of the land, settlement must have progressed from east to west, until the parish of Raminho (which was then known as Folhadais) was last to be settled. Due to the island's date of colonization and the progress of settlement along the north, the first occupation occurred around 1460, resulting in the foundation by the end of the 15th century. The fertility of the soils supported the establishment of agriculture and woad commerce (today remembered in the name of the Canada dos Engenhos) which helped establish the wealth of many of the Terceirense families. Referring to agriculture in Altares, Gaspar Frutuoso affirmed: :Until the Church of S√£o Roque the land is flat, almost half a league from the square, and weak, providing little wheat and much, thin woad, that which has lowest price among all the others, to have mixed \\"bagacina\\", almost like pumice; pastel costs little to do and less weeding for the land give little grass.Gaspar Frutuoso (1590), p.16. By the middle of the 15th century, the first important settlers arrived on the island, such as Jo√£o Valad√£o, Gon√ßalo √Ålvares Pamplona (founder of Arrochela), Manuel Borges da Costa (descendant of Jo√£o Borges \\"The Older\\", one of the first inhabitants on the island) and Jo√£o √Ålvares Homem (relative of √Ålvaro Martins Homem), founder of the city of Angra.Alfredo Lucas, Ermidas da Ilha Terceira, Angra do Hero√≠smo (1976) One of Jo√£o Valad√£o daughters married Martim Sim√£o (later identified with the toponymy of the parish, for example Pico de Matias Sim√£o or Pico de Martim Sim√£o). It is unclear when the settlement was elevated to the status of parish, but it may have occurred before 1480, associated with a reference to a parish priest.Francisco Ferreira Drumond (1489), Vol.I, Cap.V The limits of the parish were relatively undefined, but included the northwest of the island, from Faj√£ (today an uninhabited site below Mata da Serreta and territory in the parish of Serreta) to the locality of Ponta Negra, including a part of Arrochela (today part of Biscoitos). The centre of the parish, dominated by parochial church, was founded on the margins of the Ribeira de S√£o Roque, in the immediate confluence of the Ribeira das Lajinhas, an area covered in vegetation and dominated by a large, evergreen bog. The settlement was supported by ravines and natural springs that ran from the mountainous Serra de Santa B√°rbara, some from the settlement. Geography Seaside farms in Altares The parish is located in the northwestern part of the island, about 19 kilometres from the city of Angra do Hero√≠smo. It is bounded on the east by the parish of Biscoitos, which belongs to the municipality of Praia da Vit√≥ria, on the west by the parish of Raminho, on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south and southwest by the caldera of the Santa B√°rbara volcano and by the parish also called Santa B√°rbara. Altares is located along the northern flanks of the Serra de Santa B√°rbara massif, extending from the northern and western edges of the caldera of Santa Barbara volcano to the seaside cliffs on the north coast of the island. Topographically, the civil parish is bounded on the east by the course of the Ribeira do Pamplona (Pamplona Ravine), which also serves as the border to the municipality of Angra do Hero√≠smo, and on the west by a line drawn from the summit of Pico Rachado to the sea. This line follows the course of the Ribeira dos Gatos (Ravine of the Cats), but then it diverts to the west to include the hamlet of Cerro da Ribeira dos Gatos, a ridge of hills and miscellaneous buildings. The territory of the parish rises gradually from the coast, first as a relatively gentle slope, but at an increasingly rugged grade as one approaches the heights of the Serra de Santa B√°rbara, where five streams have their sources: the Riberia dos Gatos, the Ribeira de S√£o Roque, the Ribeira das Lajinhas, the Ribeira da Lapa, and the Ribeira do Pamplona. Although crossed by various river courses, the parish is actually poor in hydrographic resources, since surface water is intermittent. In fact, ravine water is primarily from intense precipitation in the foothills, lasting a short time normally. This was not the case during the period of early colonization, since the forest and tuber vegetation would regulate waterflow, resulting in light continuously flowing streams throughout the year. From east to west, the following ravines are the primarily affluent in the parish: * Ribeira do Pamplona, apart from delimiting the parish, it is also the frontier of Angra do Hero√≠smo; * Ribeira de Lapa, one of the more intensely flowing watercourses; * Ribeira da Luz; * Ribeira de S√£o Roque, alongside the parochial church (in the centre of the parish), and to its left the Ribeira das Lajinhas; * Ribeira dos Gatos Architecture =Religious= The single- nave parochial Church of S√£o Roque dating to the 15th century The Imp√©rio of the Holy Spirit, a modern imp√©rio used in religious celebrations annually For many years after settlement, small nuclei coalesced around the roadways parallel the coast dominated by chapels and hermitages, transforming into centre of the religious cults: the Hermitage of Santa Catarina of the Pamplona family (constructed in 1525) centre of the locality of Arrochela;To this hermitage were transferred the remains of General Manuel In√°cio Martins Pamplona, who was a Ministro Assistente ao Despacho in the government of King D.

Most of these hermitages have since been abandoned and disappeared from the landscape, although (in 1843), Jer√≥nimo Emiliano de AndradeJer√≥nimo Emiliano de Andrade, Topografia ou descri√ß√£o f√≠sica, politica, civil, eclesi√°stica e hist√≥rica da Ilha Terceira dos A√ßores, Angra do Hero√≠smo, 1843. affirmed the existence of many of the hermitages. Today these religious structures have been classified as national patrimony: * Church of S√£o Roque (), the parochial single-nave church, dedicated to Saint Roch, was completed in the 15th century, and is located on an elevated terrain occupied along with the parochial school, Museu Etnogr√°fico dos Altares, with an important collection of instruments associated with agriculture and traditional Azorean activities (including exhibition of flora, fauna and ecologia of Terceira). * Imp√©rio of the Holy Spirit of Altares (), dating to the early 20th century, the single-room rectangular building is used the festivals associated the Cult of the Holy Spirit held annually by the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit; it is a highly decorated facade with three gothic-style windows and door, and triangular frontispiece, but also includes annex when the events of the festivals extends.

Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other. Unlike other forms of camouflage, the intention of dazzle is not to conceal but to make it difficult to estimate a target's range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so cause them to take up a poor firing position. Dazzle was adopted by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships instantly recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that it was impossible to determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective. Experiments were carried out on aircraft in both World Wars with little success. Dazzle attracted the notice of artists such as Picasso, who claimed that Cubists like himself had invented it. Edward Wadsworth, who supervised the camouflaging of over 2,000 ships during the First World War, painted a series of canvases of dazzle shipsMarter, Joan M.

Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 46. after the war, based on his wartime work. Arthur Lismer similarly painted a series of dazzle ship canvases. Intended purposes Depiction of how Norman Wilkinson intended dazzle camouflage to cause the enemy to take up poor firing positions At first glance, dazzle seems an unlikely form of camouflage, drawing attention to the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he believed to be the applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.Forbes, 2009. pp. 87‚Äì89 Eyepiece image of a warship in a naval rangefinder, image halves not yet adjusted for range. The target's masts are especially useful for rangefinding, so Kerr proposed disrupting these with white bands. Taking up the zebra example, Kerr proposed that the vertical lines of ships' masts be disrupted with irregular white bands. Hiding these would make ships less conspicuous, and would \\"greatly increase the difficulty of accurate range finding\\". However, in the same letter, Kerr also called for countershading, the use of paint to obliterate self-shading and thus to flatten out the appearance of solid, recognisable shapes. For example, he proposed painting ships' guns grey on top, grading to white below, so the guns would disappear against a grey background. Similarly, he advised painting shaded parts of the ship white, and brightly lit parts in grey, again with smooth grading between them, making shapes and structures invisible. Kerr was thus hoping to achieve both a measure of invisibility and a degree of confusion for the enemy using a rangefinder. Whether through this mixing of goals, or the Admiralty's skepticism about \\"any theory based upon the analogy of animals\\", the Admiralty claimed in July 1915 to have conducted \\"various trials\\" and decided to paint its ships in monotone grey, not adopting any of Kerr's suggestions. It had made up its mind, and all Kerr's subsequent letters achieved nothing. The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer had developed a theory of camouflage based on countershading and disruptive coloration, which he had published in the controversial 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom. Seeing the opportunity to put his theory into service, Thayer wrote to Churchill in February 1915, proposing to camouflage submarines by countershading them like fish such as mackerel, and advocating painting ships white to make them invisible. His ideas were considered by the Admiralty, but rejected along with Kerr's proposals as being \\"freak methods of painting ships ... of academic interest but not of practical advantage\\". The Admiralty noted that the required camouflage would vary depending on the light, the changing colours of sea and sky, the time of day, and the angle of the sun. Thayer made repeated and desperate efforts to persuade the authorities, and in November 1915 travelled to England where he gave demonstrations of his theory around the country. He had a warm welcome from Kerr in Glasgow, and was so enthused by this show of support that he avoided meeting the War Office, who he had been intending to win over, and instead sailed home, continuing to write ineffective letters to the British and American authorities. The marine artist and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was confusion rather than concealment, but disagreed about the type of confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson wanted to do was to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.Glover, Michael. \\"Now you see it...

The conspicuous markings obscure the ship's heading. Wilkinson advocated \\"masses of strongly contrasted colour\\" to confuse the enemy about a ship's heading. Thus, while dazzle, in some lighting conditions or at close ranges, might actually increase a ship's visibility,Forbes, 2009. pp. 90‚Äì91 the conspicuous patterns would obscure the outlines of the ship's hull (though admittedly not the superstructureForbes, 2009. p. 97), disguising the ship's correct heading and making it harder to hit.Forbes, 2009. p. 96 Dazzle was created in response to an extreme need, and hosted by an organisation, the Admiralty, which had already rejected an approach supported by scientific theory: Kerr's proposal to use \\"parti-colouring\\" based on the known camouflage methods of disruptive coloration and countershading. This was dropped in favour of an admittedly non-scientific approach, led by the socially well-connected Wilkinson.Forbes, 2009. pp. 98‚Äì100 Kerr's explanations of the principles were clear, logical, and based on years of study, while Wilkinson's were simple and inspirational, based on an artist's perception. The decision was likely because the Admiralty felt comfortable with Wilkinson, in sharp contrast to their awkward relationship with the stubborn and pedantic Kerr.Forbes, 2009. p. 92. Wilkinson claimed not to have known of the zoological theories of camouflage of Kerr and Thayer, admitting only to having heard of the \\"old invisibility-idea\\" from Roman times. Possible mechanisms A naval coincidence rangefinder, c. 1930 =Disrupting rangefinding= In 1973, the naval museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) suggested a mechanism by which dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate the ship's speed. =Disguising heading and speed= , 's sister ship, in dazzle camouflage while in service as a World War I troopship, from September 1915 The historian Sam Willis argued that since Wilkinson knew it was impossible to make a ship invisible with paint, the \\"extreme opposite\\" was the answer, using conspicuous shapes and violent colour contrasts to confuse enemy submarine commanders. Willis pointed out, using the dazzle scheme as an example, that different mechanisms could have been at work. The contradictory patterns on the ship's funnels could imply the ship was on a different heading (as Wilkinson had said). The curve on the hull below the front funnel could seem to be a false bow wave, creating a misleading impression of the ship's speed. And the striped patterns at bow and stern could create confusion about which end of the ship was which. That dazzle did indeed work along these lines is suggested by the testimony of a U-boat captain: =Motion dazzle= In 2011, the scientist Nicholas E. Scott-Samuel and colleagues presented evidence using moving patterns on a computer that human perception of speed is distorted by dazzle patterns. However, the speeds required for motion dazzle are much larger than were available to First World War ships: Scott-Samuel notes that the targets in the experiment would correspond to a dazzle-patterned Land Rover vehicle at a range of , travelling at . If such a dazzling target causes a 7% confusion in the observed speed, a rocket propelled grenade travelling that distance in half a second would strike from the intended aiming point, or 7% of the distance moved by the target. This might be enough to save lives in the dazzle-patterned vehicle, and perhaps to cause the missile to miss entirely. World War I displaying a coat of dazzle camouflage in 1918 =British Royal Navy= In 1914, Kerr persuaded the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to adopt a form of military camouflage which he called \\"parti- colouring\\". He argued both for countershading (following the American artist Abbott Thayer), and for disruptive coloration, both as used by animals.Forbes, 2009. p. 87 A general order to the British fleet issued on 10 November 1914 advocated use of Kerr's approach. It was applied in various ways to British warships such as , where officers noted approvingly that the pattern \\"increased difficulty of accurate range finding\\". However, following Churchill's departure from the Admiralty, the Royal Navy reverted to plain grey paint schemes, informing Kerr in July 1915 that \\"various trials had been undertaken and that the range of conditions of light and surroundings rendered it necessary to modify considerably any theory based upon the analogy of [the colours and patterns of] animals\\".Forbes, 2009. p. 88 A painting by Norman Wilkinson of a moonlit convoy wearing his dazzle camouflage, 1918 Official report on a camouflaged ship in 1918. The British Army inaugurated its Camouflage Section for land use at the end of 1916. At sea in 1917, heavy losses of merchant ships to Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare campaign led to new desire for camouflage. The marine painter Norman Wilkinson promoted a system of stripes and broken lines \\"to distort the external shape by violent colour contrasts\\" and confuse the enemy about the speed and dimensions of a ship.Fisher, Mark. \\"Secret history: how surrealism can win a war,\\" The Times. 8 January 2006. Wilkinson, then a lieutenant commander on Royal Navy patrol duty, implemented the precursor of \\"dazzle\\" beginning with the merchantman SS Industry. Wilkinson was put in charge of a camouflage unit which used the technique on large groups of merchant ships. Over 4000 British merchant ships were painted in what came to be known as \\"dazzle camouflage\\"; dazzle was also applied to some 400 naval vessels, starting in August 1917. All British patterns were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most of the model designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage. Wilkinson's Dazzle camouflage was accepted by the Admiralty, even without practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours.Williams, 2001. p. 35 The dazzle camouflage strategy was adopted by other navies. This led to more scientific studies of colour options which might enhance camouflage effectiveness.Williams, 2001. p. 40 After the war, starting on 27 October 1919, an Admiralty committee met to determine who had priority for the invention of dazzle. Kerr was asked whether he thought Wilkinson had personally benefited from anything that he, Kerr, had written. Kerr avoided the question, implying that he had not, and said \\"I make no claim to have invented the principle of parti-colouring, this principle was, of course, invented by nature\\". He agreed also that he had not suggested anywhere in his letters that his system would \\"create an illusion as to the course of the vessel painted\\". In October 1920 the Admiralty told Kerr that he was not seen as responsible for dazzle painting. In 1922 Wilkinson was awarded the sum of ¬£2000 for the invention. =Royal Flying Corps= A Felixstowe F.2, finished in a naval black and white scheme In the First World War, experiments were conducted on British aircraft such as the Royal Flying Corps' Sopwith Camels to make their angle and direction difficult to judge for an enemy gunner. Similarly the Royal Navy painted some of their Felixstowe flying boats with bold disrupting lines similar to those of their ship camouflage. The effect remained dubious, but was found to reduce the incidence of the planes being targeted by anti-aircraft gunners on their own side. =Effectiveness= Dazzle's effectiveness was highly uncertain at the time of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships had been attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. Furthermore, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable. With hindsight, too many factors (choice of colour scheme; size and speed of ships; tactics used) had been varied for it to be possible to determine which factors were significant or which schemes worked best. Thayer did carry out an experiment on dazzle camouflage, but it failed to show any reliable advantage over plain paintwork. The American data were analysed by Harold Van Buskirk in 1919. About 1,256 ships were painted in dazzle between 1 March 1918 and the end of the war on 11 November that year. Among American merchantmen 2,500 tons and over, 78 uncamouflaged ships were sunk, and only 18 camouflaged ships; out of these 18, 11 were sunk by torpedoes, 4 in collisions and 3 by mines. No US Navy ships (all camouflaged) were sunk in the period. World War II =Ships= Dazzle under development: the \\"Outside Viewing-tank\\" on the roof of the Directorate of Camouflage Naval Section, Leamington Spa. James Yunge-Bateman, 1943 However effective dazzle camouflage may have been in World War I, it became less useful as rangefinders and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, by the time it was put to use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness. However, it may still have confounded enemy submarines. In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint schemes reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and competitions were often held between ships for the best camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy's Camouflage Department came up with a scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into the Western Approaches Schemes. In 1942 the Admiralty Intermediate Disruptive Pattern came into use, followed in 1944 by the Admiralty Standard Schemes. Dazzle patterns were tested on small model ships at the Royal Navy's Directorate of Camouflage in Leamington Spa; these were painted and then viewed in a shallow tank on the building's roof. wearing Measure 5, a false bow wave The United States Navy implemented a camouflage painting program in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each identified with a number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. Not all United States Navy measures involved dazzle patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false bow wave on traditional Haze Gray, or Deck Blue replacing grey over part or all of the ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). Dazzle measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use dazzle, ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific. Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine first used camouflage in the 1940 Norwegian campaign. A wide range of patterns were authorised, but most commonly black and white diagonal stripes were used. Most patterns were designed to hide ships in harbour or near the coast; they were often painted over with plain grey when operating in the Atlantic. =Aircraft= In 1940, the US Navy conducted experiments with dazzle-type camouflage for aircraft. The artist McClelland Barclay designed \\"pattern camouflage\\" schemes for US Navy aircraft such as the Douglas TBD Devastator and the Brewster F2A Buffalo to make it difficult for the enemy to gauge the shape and position of the aircraft. The camouflaged aircraft were flown in combat, but the effect was found not to be satisfactory.

With characteristic hyperbole,Forbes, 2009. p. 104 he claimed credit for camouflage experiments, which seemed to him a quintessentially Cubist technique. In a conversation with Gertrude Stein shortly after he first saw a painted cannon trundling through the streets of Paris he remarked, \\"Yes it is we who made it, that is cubism\\". In Britain, Edward Wadsworth, who supervised dazzle camouflage painting in the war, created a series of canvases after the war based on his dazzle work on ships. In Canada, Arthur Lismer used dazzle ships in some of his wartime compositions. In America, Burnell Poole painted canvases of United States Navy ships in dazzle camouflage at sea. The historian of camouflage Peter Forbes comments that the ships had a Modernist look, their designs succeeding as avant-garde or Vorticist art. In 2007, the art of camouflage, including the evolution of dazzle, was featured as the theme for a show at the Imperial War Museum. In 2009, the Fleet Library at the Rhode Island School of Design exhibited its rediscovered collection of lithographic printed plans for the camouflage of American World War I merchant ships, in an exhibition titled \\"Bedazzled\\". In 2014, the Centenary Art Commission backed three dazzle camouflage installations in Britain: Carlos Cruz-Diez covered the pilot ship in Liverpool's Canning Dock with bright multi-coloured dazzle artwork, as part of the city's 2014 Liverpool Biennial art festival; and Tobias Rehberger painted , anchored since 1922 at Blackfriars Bridge in London, to commemorate the use of dazzle, a century on. Peter Blake was commissioned to design exterior paintwork for , a Mersey Ferry, which he called \\"Everybody Razzle Dazzle\\", combining his trademark motifs (stars, targets etc.) with First World War dazzle designs.

During the 2015 Formula 1 testing period, the Red Bull RB11 car was painted in a scheme intended to confound rival teams' ability to analyse its aerodynamics. The designer Adam Harvey has similarly proposed a form of camouflage reminiscent of dazzle for personal camouflage from face-detection technology, which he calls computer vision dazzle. Its intention is to block detection by facial recognition technologies such as DeepFace \\"by creating an 'anti-face'\\". It uses occlusion, covering certain facial features; transformation, altering the shape or colour of parts of the face; and a combination of the two. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has used dazzle patterns on its fleet since 2009. Notes References Sources * Forbes, Peter (2009). Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage.

This Zehlendorf site, which until the end of World War II was referred to as the Rehmate Radio Transmission Centre (German:Funksendestelle Rehmate), had 26 different antennas. In 2017 the antenna was controlled demolished by implosion. https://www.senderfotos.de/senderfotos-national/brandenburg/zehlendorf/ History In 1945, most of the Rehmate Radio Transmission Centre was dismantled by the Soviet occupying forces as reparation, who left only three wooden radio masts. These wooden masts supplied the building material for a 100-metre-tall transmission tower built at Golm in 1948, which was used until 1979. In 1952 it was decided to build at the location of the former radio transmission center Rehmate the central long wave transmitter of the GDR. For this between 1956 and 1958 a triangle plane aerial, which was hung up on three 150 metres high guyed masts of lattice steel, which were insulated against ground was built. A second transmitting antenna, which should become the main antenna, was built between 1960 and 1962. It consisted of a , lattice steel framework mast, at which a conical cage aerial was mounted, making it the tallest structure in Europe between 1962 and 1964. With this antenna a transmitting power of 750 kilowatts in the long-wave rae on a frequency, which was reduced in course of the time gradually for the reduction by interference from 185 kHz to 177 kHz, was possible. The maximum transmitting power, which is possible over the triangle plane aerial, is 500 kilowatts. On 18 May 1978 the main mast collapsed after a collision with a Russian airplane of the type Mig-21. After the cause of the collapse was certain, the Soviet Union promised to supply a new mast and to rebuild this. In order not to stop the progress of the construction work by the stricter German safety regulations, for the duration of the construction work the area in the radius of 300 metres was explained as Soviet exclave. In August 1979 the new mast with a height of 359.7 metres was finished. In 1990 the plant was taken over by the Deutsche Telekom AG. At first it was planned to shut down the facility: so the cage aerial at the main mast was dismantled and the transmitting power of the long wave transmitter was reduced occasionally to 100 kilowatts. In the second half of the 1990s a reorientation occurred. The long wave transmitter was modernized and the main antenna tower received a new cage aerial. Also the transmitting power of the long wave transmitter was increased again to 500 kW. In the year 2000 a , guyed, grounded mast of lattice steel carrying a cage aerial for medium wave was built. This took over the function of the former Transmitter Berlin-Koepenick and served apart from the spreading of the program of MEGARADIO also for transmitting of programs of the Voice of Russia, partly in the Simulcast mode. The long wave transmitter changed over on 29 August 2005 as first German large transmitter to Digital Radio Mondiale. The long wave transmitter ceased operation on December 31, 2014 as part of the general shutdown in Germany of AM radio services to the public. The mast continues to support VHF radio antennas providing FM broadcast services.

Retrieved: 19 August 2011. was an early jet fighter built in the Soviet Union shortly after World War II. The design began in 1944 and was intended to use Soviet-designed turbojet engines. The design was heavily influenced by captured German jet fighters and it was subsequently redesigned to use a Soviet copy of a German turbojet. The Su-9 was slower than competing Soviet aircraft and it was cancelled as a result. A modified version with different engines and a revised wing became the Su-11 (Samolyet KL), but this did not enter production either. The Su-13 (Samolyet KT) was a proposal to re-engine the aircraft with Soviet copies of the Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet as well as to modify it for night fighting, but neither proposal was accepted. Design and development =Su-9= In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began designing a twin- engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably influenced by a captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not a copy of the German aircraft.Gordon, p. 115 The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162. The aircraft carried a total of of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4¬∞20'. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic-powered controls.Gordon, pp. 116, 119‚Äì20 A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage.Gordon, p. 119 The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27 kN (530 lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted on the sides of the fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.Gordon, p. 116 The nose housed the armament of one Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 could be replaced by a Nudelman N-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.Gordon, p. 120 As the TR-1 engines originally intended for the Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup was found to be acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.Gordon, pp. 116‚Äì17 The aircraft was revealed to the general public on 3 August 1947 at a flypast at Moscow's Tushino Airfield and the aircraft began its state acceptance trials three days later. Flight testing was completed by 25 May 1948 after 136 flights had been completed. It demonstrated a top speed of at an altitude of and an endurance of one hour and 44 minutes. It had very docile handling qualities with one engine inoperative. The aircraft was recommended for production, but it was significantly slower than the Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-9 and Yakovlev Yak-15. The government declined to do so and the program was terminated.Gordon, p. 117 A two-seat trainer version, the Su-9UT, was planned during 1946, but it too was cancelled. The cockpit for the student would have been positioned ahead of the instructor's cockpit and each would have had a separate canopy. The armament would have been reduced to a pair of Berezin B-20 autocannon, each with a hundred rounds of ammunition. The armor would have been removed to save weight. =Su-11= Another prototype was begun in 1946, but this aircraft was intended to use the Yakovlev-designed version of the afterburning RD-10F engine. However, wind tunnel testing of the Su-9 in September revealed that drag could be reduced if the engine nacelles were mounted in the wing rather than underneath it, and the wing tips were redesigned to use a different airfoil that significantly reduced Mach tuck. These changes required that the entire wing be redesigned; the wing spar was bent into an inverted U to accommodate the engines and slotted flaps replaced the simple flaps previously used. The tailplane was given a 5¬∞ dihedral to move it out of the engine exhaust.Gordon, pp. 117‚Äì18 Before the prototype was finished, Sukhoi was ordered to use the Lyulka TR-1 turbojets originally intended for the Su-9. This aircraft was designated the Su-11 and was called Samolyet KL by the OKB. Each TR-1 developed only 12.7 kN (2,865 lbf) thrust each, rather than the 15 kN (3300 lbf) required. The aircraft made its first flight on 28 May 1947 and also participated in the flypast at Tushino in August. It had a maximum speed of at sea level, but flight testing revealed that it lacked longitudinal stability at high speeds. Modifications of the wing/nacelle fillets and lengthening the engine nacelles failed to cure these problems. Coupled with the unavailability of mature TR-1 engines, these problems caused the program to be cancelled.Gordon, p. 118 =Su-13= The Su-13, (Samolyet KT), was the final attempt to further increase performance of the basic Su-9 design, using wing sections reduced from 11% to 9% thickness/chord ratio and swept tailplanes. The aircraft was also fitted with a pair of Klimov RD-500 (unlicensed copies of the Rolls-Royce Derwent) engines with 15.6 kN (3,500 lbf) thrust each. The armament was changed to three 37 mm Nudelman N-37 cannon, while drop tanks could be fitted underneath the wingtips. A night fighter version with a Torii radar was also proposed, but this required major structural changes to accommodate the radar. Neither version made it off the drawing board.

Europe participated in and won the \\"Rock Sm\\", Swedish championship of rock, broadcast on television in 1982, with Norum being voted best guitarist and Joey best vocalist. The championship prize was the recording of a studio album by a small Swedish label. The album Europe was released in February 1983 and became a hit in the band's home country and in Japan. In February 1984 Wings of Tomorrow, the band's next album was released, and the band started to become very popular on the Swedish scene, touring throughout the country, and also gaining recognition in Japan. The band signed to Epic Records in 1985 and recorded the album The Final Countdown at the end of the year. In May 1986, The Final Countdown was released, and quickly achieved success in several European countries, Japan, United States. A series of disagreements between Norum and the band's manager Thomas Erdtman began to occur even before the tour began, which led the guitarist to decide to leave the band in October 1986. After having left Europe, Norum signed a solo contract for 3 studio albums with Europe's label. His solo debut,Total Control, was released in October 1987 . Norum sang on almost all of the songs, while Goran Edman sang on the other three. The album was successful in Sweden, getting to #4 in the Swedish charts and gaining platinum status (the single \\"Let Me Love You\\" also went to #4 in the Swedish charts; the ballad \\"Back On The Streets\\" to #34 Billboard Us Rock). Norum won all the music awards of the year in the country in 1988. The band toured Sweden. Their last show took place at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England in late 1988. John Norum's talent, evident on albums with Europe and his first solo album, sparked the interest of vocalist Don Dokken of the American band Dokken, who split up in 1988. Norum was enlisted to contribute to the album Up From The Ashes, which came out as Don Dokken's first solo album in 1990, and they went on tour in 1991. In 1990, Norum released a mini E.P. live, recorded in 1988, Live In Stockholm. In 1992, the album Face The Truth was released. The album was a project with former Deep Purple frontman Glenn Hughes, with Glenn singing practically all of the songs. Joey Tempest also guested on the album. In 1995, the album Another Destination was released, being his last release for Epic Records. He toured behind the album in Sweden with new vocalist, Kelly Keeling, who had also sung on the album. In December 1996, another album, Worlds Away released (again with Keeling singing), through a new record company, Mascot Records. The following year, a show in Japan was recorded (with new singer, Leif Sundin), which was released as the Face It Live album. At the end of 1997, John Norum performed 15 shows as part of Dokken in the United States, replacing George Lynch who had once again left the band. In 1999, Norum released his last solo album before his return to Europe, Slipped Into Tomorrow, with him on vocals. He went on tour in Scandinavia, with Thin Lizzy guitar player Brian Robertson playing songs of that band. At the turn of the millennium, John Norum participated in Europe's inaugural concert for Swedish TV, playing with the band again after 14 years of absence. He again joined the band that same year, this time at the Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm, to play Rock The Night. In 2001, Norum joined Dokken as an official member. They toured the United States in 2001 and in 2002 released the Long Way Home album. During a tour of Europe, not satisfied with Don Dokken's temperament, he decided to leave the band. In 2003, Europe announced its official reforming of the classic five-man lineup, with Norum officially returning to the band, having not been a member for 17 years. He refused an offer by UFO before rejoining Europe (Norum had already rejected an offer from UFO in 1996, plus Michael Schenker who had left, upon learning of the offer made to Norum, returned to the band). Since 2004, Europe has released six further studio albums, while Norum released a further sixth and seventh solo album, Optimus in 2005, and Play Yard Blues in 2010, singing on both albums. A new solo album was slated to be released in 2021, more focused musically on Europe's bluesy style of rock, but so far no official release date has been given for the album. Personal life Norum started and developed his musical career in Sweden, but has also lived in the United States for a few years, where he met and married Michelle Meldrum in 1995, founder and lead guitarist of the all- female hard rock band Phantom Blue and the Swedish metal band Meldrum. The couple had one son, Jake Thomas, born on 22 September 2004. On 21 May 2008, Michelle died from a cystic growth in her brain. Another son, Jim Henry, was born on 16 April 2012, to him and his Swedish fianc√©e Camilla W√•hlander. The couple also had a daughter, Celine Margareta, born on 28 July 2014. Norum is the older brother of singer Tone Norum. and his stepfather is Thomas Witt, a former record producer, Columbia executive and drummer for Eddie Meduza.

He is the son of Ingrid Croce and the late Jim Croce. Life, family, and tragedies Croce was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 1971, and his early years were filled with tragedy. His father died in a plane crash eight days before his second birthday, and he and his newly-widowed mother had to move to San Diego, almost 3,000 miles from his native city with the rest of his family. Two years later, he was completely blinded as the result of serious physical abuse at the hands of his mother's boyfriend.Hislop, Christopher (March 5, 2015) A.J. Croce brings live show to The Loft (According to his mother's autobiography, \\"When our son Adrian James was almost four, he suffered a brain tumor syndrome and went blind.\\") He did, however, gradually regain vision in his left eye and found respite in learning to play the piano. \\"I learned to play music by listening and playing along to the radio and to records. At some point I was given the music of Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder as inspiration, which it was, and has been ever since.\\" When he was 15 the house in which he had lived for most of his life burned down. In 2018, his wife, Marlo Gordon Croce, died of \\"a rare and sudden heart virus\\" while he was in the midst of a health scare. A.J. was left a single father to two children, a daughter, Camille, and a son, Elijah. Musical career Croce's first paying gig was at the age of 12, when he was paid $20 ($53.45 in 2019 worth) to perform at a bar mitzvah party. By the age of 16, Croce was performing regularly at San Diego nightclubs as a sideman and band leader. Croce reflected, \\"I was into every kind of music... you might say I was unfocused, but I consider an eclectic taste in music to be the foundation of versatility.\\" Ron Goldstein and Peter Baumann of Private Music signed Croce to his first recording contract at age 19. He recorded two albums for Private Music: his self-titled debut, A. J.

The primary lake, lower Priest, is 19 miles long and over 300 feet deep.http://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/priestlake.aspx State of Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation Upper Priest is connected by a 2.5 mile thoroughfare to lower Priest. History The history of the lake dates back almost 10,000 years to the end of the last ice age. After the vast glaciers that covered most of the area receded and vegetation started to re-grow, humans started to resettle the area. This is evident from historical artifacts found in the area and ancient rock art along the lake. The first white settlers arrived in the early 19th century. These early settlers were mainly fur trappers who quickly established trade with the native Kalispel Tribe. Jesuit Priests would eventually settle the lake in the 1840s and establish a base camp at Kalispell Bay. One of these priests, Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet, a native Belgian who had escaped from European persecution and became the most trusted of the white men among the Western Native Americans, named the lake Roothaan Lake for one of his superiors in Rome. The name would not stick though and in 1865 Captain John Mullan, a U.S. Army Captain who was traveling through the area under orders to build the \\"Mullan Trail\\" from Walla Walla, Washington to Fort Benton, Montana after the discovery of silver in the central Idaho mountains along what today is the route of Interstate 90, would rename the lake Kaniksu. Kaniksu is believed to be the native word for \\"black robe\\" and because of the Jesuit presence, the lake was later named Priest Lake. Logging From the 1890s logging has played an important role at Priest Lake. Logs were floated down the lake, and eventually to the outlet where they would travel down the Priest River until they reached the mills on the Pend Oreille River. National concern over conservation of natural resources led to the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, under which the Priest River Forest Reserve was established in 1897. This forest reserve subsequently evolved into the Kaniksu National Forest ‚Äì which has been recently incorporated into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests system. Most of the area on the east side of Priest Lake was gradually consolidated into State of Idaho lands beginning after Idaho's admission into statehood in 1890. In 1950 these state lands to the east of Priest Lake were designated as Priest Lake State Forest. Later, in the 1980s, the State executed land exchanges with private companies that added nearly 13,000 acres (53 km¬≤) to the state forest and resulted in its present boundaries. Wildlife A moose feeding Priest Lake has a pristine variety of wildlife both in and around the lake. The standard bear, deer, and moose population that can be seen throughout northern Washington and Idaho is present about the lake, as well as a small population of grizzly bears. Priest Lake also has a large population of fish, including Cutthroat trout, Kokanee, Lake trout, and Dolly Varden trout. The largest lake trout caught in the United States was caught at Priest Lake, by a Spokane Washington man, Lyle McClure, in 1971 and weighed 57 lbs. 8 oz. The average lake trout ranges weighs in between 4 and 10 pounds. In 2006, Eurasian milfoil, an aquatic invasive species, was discovered in Priest Lake. Tourism Today the lake's biggest draw is tourism. There are several large private resorts on the lake including Elkins Resort and Hill's Resort. Popular campgrounds include Indian Creek and Lionhead run by the State of Idaho as well as Beaver Creek, Reeder Bay, Osprey, Outlet Bay, and Luby Bay, which are all located in and run by the Idaho Panhandle National Forest. Several hiking trails circle the lake, also connecting to the Upper Priest Lake. In the wintertime, the larger resorts cater to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. There is also a Bed and Breakfast -the historic Old Northern Inn, Coolin Motel, Nordman Resort (Nordman, Idaho), and three marinas, one located at the lake's largest town, Coolin. The Priest Lake Public Library, located at the corner of Luby Bay Road and Highway 57, is open year-round. Housed in the historic Lamb Creek School, the library has wireless internet access and an extensive local history collection. The area is known for its huckleberries which visitors are encouraged to hike in and pick.http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm9_018792.pdf Weather Both summer and winter activities at the lake are made possible by a truly four-season climate. Summers are generally warm and sunny with high temperatures around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). Swimming and boating are very popular in the summer. Winters are cold and snowy, and although not as cold as east of the Rocky Mountains, the area does get much more snow. Sixty inches (1.5 m) precipitation falls in the mountains around the lake each year with almost half of that coming in the form of snow. Cross country skiing and snowmobiling are popular winter activities.

In almost every chapter, Greene introduces basic concepts and then slowly builds to a climax, usually a scientific breakthrough. Greene then attempts to connect with his reader by posing simple analogies to help explain the meaning of a scientific concept without oversimplifying the theory behind it. In the preface, Greene acknowledges that some parts of the book are controversial among scientists. He discusses the leading viewpoints in the main text and points of contention in the endnotes. The endnotes contain more complete explanations of points that are simplified in the main text.  Summary  =Part I: Reality's Arena= The main focus of Part I is space and time. Chapter 1, \\"Roads to Reality\\", Introduces what is to come later in the book, such as discussions revolving around classical physics, quantum mechanics, and cosmological physics. Chapter 2, \\"The Universe and the Bucket\\", features space as its key point. The question posed by Greene is this: \\"Is space a human abstraction, or is it a physical entity?\\" The key thought experiment is a spinning bucket of water, designed to make one think about what creates the force felt inside the bucket when it is spinning. The ideas of Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Gottfried Leibniz on this thought experiment are discussed in detail. Chapter 3, \\"Relativity and the Absolute\\", focuses on spacetime. The question now becomes: \\"Is spacetime an Einsteinian abstraction or a physical entity?\\" In this chapter, concepts of both special relativity and general relativity are discussed, as well as their importance to the meaning of spacetime. In chapter 4, \\"Entangling Space\\", Greene explores the revolution of the quantum mechanical era, focusing on what it means for objects to be separate and distinct in a universe dictated by quantum laws. This chapter studies quantum mechanics, including the concepts of probability waves and interference patterns, particle spin, the photon double slit experiment, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The reader is also informed of challenges posed to quantum mechanics by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen. =Part II: Time and Experience= Part II begins by addressing the issue that time is a very familiar concept, yet it is one of humanity's least understood concepts. Chapter 5, \\"The Frozen River\\", deals with the question, \\"Does time flow?\\" One key point in this chapter deals with special relativity. Observers moving relative to each other have different conceptions of what exists at a given moment, and hence they have different conceptions of reality. The conclusion is that time does not flow, as all things simultaneously exist at the same time. Chapter 6, \\"Chance and the Arrow\\", asks, \\"Does time have an arrow?\\" The reader discovers that the laws of physics apply moving both forward in time and backward in time. Such a law is called time-reversal symmetry. One of the major subjects of this chapter is entropy. Various analogies are given to illustrate how entropy works and its apparent paradoxes. The climax of the chapter is the co-relation between entropy and gravity, and that the beginning of the Universe must be the state of minimum entropy. In Chapters 5 and 6, time has been explained only in terms of pre- modern physics. Chapter 7, \\"Time and the Quantum\\", gives insights into time's nature in the quantum realm. Probability plays a major role in this chapter because it is an inescapable part of quantum mechanics. The double slit experiment is revisited to reveal things about the past. Many other experiments are presented in this chapter, such as the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. Other major issues are brought to the reader's attention, such as quantum mechanics and experience, as well as quantum mechanics and the measurement problem. Finally, this chapter addresses the important subject of decoherence and its relevance towards the macroscopic world. =Part III: Spacetime and Cosmology= Part III deals with the macroscopic realm of the cosmos. Chapter 8, \\"Of Snowflakes and Spacetime\\", tells the reader that the history of the universe is in fact the history of symmetry. Symmetry and its importance to cosmic evolution becomes the focus of this chapter. Again, general relativity is addressed as a stretching fabric of spacetime. Cosmology, symmetry, and the shape of space are put together in a new way. Chapter 9, \\"Vaporizing the Vacuum\\", introduces the theoretical idea of the Higgs boson. This chapter focuses on the critical first fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when the amount of symmetry in the universe was thought to have changed abruptly by a process known as symmetry breaking. This chapter also brings into play the theory of grand unification and entropy is also revisited. Chapter 10, \\"Deconstructing the Bang\\", makes inflationary cosmology the main point. General relativity and the discovery of dark energy (repulsive gravity) are taken into account, as well as the cosmological constant. Certain problems that arise due to the standard Big Bang theory are addressed, and new answers are given using inflationary cosmology. Such problems include the horizon problem and the flatness problem. Matter distribution throughout the cosmos is also discussed, including the concepts of dark matter and dark energy. Chapter 11, \\"Quanta in the Sky with Diamonds\\", continues with the topic of inflation, and the arrow of time is also discussed again. The chapter addresses three main developments: the formation of structures such as galaxies, the amount of energy required to spawn the universe we now see, and the origin of time's arrow. =Part IV: Origins and Unification= Part IV deals with new theoretical aspects of physics, particularly in the author's field. Chapter 12, \\"The World on a String\\", informs the reader of the structure of the fabric of space according to string theory. New concepts are introduced, including the Planck length and the Planck time, and ideas from The Elegant Universe are revisited. The reader will learn how string theory could fill the gaps between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Chapter 13, \\"The Universe on a Brane\\", expands on ideas from chapter 12, particularly on M-theory, of which string theory is a branch. This chapter is devoted to speculations on space and time. The insights of a number of physicists, including Edward Witten and Paul Dirac, are presented. The focus of the chapter becomes gravity and its involvement with extra dimensions. Near the end of the chapter, a brief section is devoted to the cyclic model. =Part V: Reality and Imagination= Part V deals with many theoretical concepts, including space and time travel. Chapter 14, \\"Up in the Heavens and Down on the Earth\\", is about various experiments with space and time. Previous theories are brought back from previous chapters, such as Higgs theory, supersymmetry, and string theory. Future planned experiments are described in an attempt to verify many of the theoretical concepts discussed, including the constituents of dark matter and dark energy, the existence of the Higgs boson, and the verification of extra spatial dimensions. Chapter 15, \\"Teleporters and Time Machines\\", is about traveling through space and time using intriguing methods. Quantum mechanics is brought back into the picture when the reader comes across teleportation. Puzzles of time travel are posed, such as the idea of time travel to the past being a possibility. The end of the chapter focuses on wormholes and the theory behind them. Chapter 16, \\"The Future of an Allusion\\", focuses on black holes and their relationship to entropy. The main idea of this chapter is that spacetime may not be the fundamental makeup of the universe's fabric.

Formed in Athens, Georgia in 2001, they later moved to Omaha, Nebraska and became part of the Saddle Creek Records music scene, which also included Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive. Azure Ray's music has often been featured in film and television, including Six Feet Under, Grey's Anatomy, and The Devil Wears Prada. Biography =Formation= The pair met at the age of 15 while attending the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, which released two CDs, Who Did You Pay (1997, Tim/Kerr) and It's in the Sound (2000, Monolyth Record Group), which earned them frequent comparisons to Veruca Salt. After the band broke up, Fink and Taylor moved to Athens, Georgia, and eventually formed Azure Ray. \\"My boyfriend had just died and we had written all of these songs that were helping us cope with everything. We had a night where all of our friends and family got together. We played those songs, which later would turn into the songs on our first Azure Ray record...\\" said Taylor. =Azure Ray (2001)= The pair signed to the Warm Electronic Recordings label and released their self-titled debut in 2001, produced by Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf). Pitchfork praised the album, giving it a 7 out of 10, describing it as a collection of \\"maudlin but beautiful, expertly crafted pop songs\\". The song \\"Sleep\\" was later featured in the 2006 Academy Award-nominated movie The Devil Wears Prada featuring Anne Hathaway. In February 2015, Taylor Swift included \\"Sleep\\" on a six-song \\"breakup playlist\\" made for a fan via her official Tumblr. DJ Paul Kalkbrenner also sampled \\"Rise\\" in his 2008 song \\"Azure\\". =Burn and Shiver and New Resolution EP(2002)= Azure Ray's second album, Burn and Shiver, was released in 2002, again produced by Bachmann. With Burn and Shiver, Pitchfork said the duo had \\"come closer than ever to wielding an emotional potency like master Cohen's\\". After meeting Fink and Taylor in Athens, Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst invited the band on tour and introduced them to the people at Saddle Creek, the label to which he was signed. They relocated to Omaha, Nebraska and joined the music scene there. The New Resolution EP was released on January 1, 2002, and was the band's first for Saddle Creek. Pitchfork gave it a 7.5, calling it \\"is as subtle as it is brittle, and as gracefully measured as anything the duo has released to date\\". The two collaborated with Moby and co-wrote the songs \\"Great Escape\\" (on his album 18) and \\"Landing\\" (which appeared on the XXX soundtrack), and afterwards joined him on tour.Billboard.comMoby jams with Azure Ray, hosts house party Retrieved 30 Nov 2012 =Hold On Love (2003) and Hiatus= Hold On Love was the band's third full-length, released October 7, 2003 on Saddle Creek. Pitchfork called it a departure from their previous records, with \\"newly arresting manipulations of electronic elements interlock[ing] with the duo's traditional organic fare, as well as bolder and sharper production\\". Azure Ray went on hiatus in 2004, leaving Fink and Taylor to work on solo albums and other collaborative projects, including a stint in Now It's Overhead.Last.fm - Azure Ray Retrieved 30 Nov 2012 =Reunion and Drawing Down the Moon (2010)= Fink and Taylor reformed the band for a one- off show in Los Angeles at the iconic Troubadour on November 30, 2008, accompanied by Andy LeMaster of Now It's Overhead and Nick White of Tilly and the Wall.

Nelson House is located about west of Thompson and is accessible via the mixed paved and gravel Provincial Road 391. Nisichawayasihk means where three rivers meet in Cree and describes Nelson House which is located at the convergence of the Burntwood River, Footprint and Rat Rivers. History The people of Nisichawayasihk are largely ancestral descendants of indigenous Cree peoples who have populated the Canadian Shield region of northern and central Canada since the retreat of the glaciers about 10,000 years ago. Largely left alone by the Government of Canada during initial colonization and settlement of Western Canada. In the mid-1870s, the Indigenous peoples of the Lake Winnipeg area were interested in making a treaty with the Government of Canada. They had heard about the concessions offered to the Indigenous nations of Treaties 1 to 4 (see Numbered Treaties), and subsequently demanded the government provide similar economic assistance, provisions of tools and protection against the encroachment of outsiders (such as surveyors and settlers) on their territories. Treaty 5 was the response from the government that ensure the homelands of the Cree were protected for their use. Treaty 5, a document which established that Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation members and their descendants were guaranteed certain rights and benefits. Governance and population Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation is governed by an elected chief and council. Elections are held pursuant to NCN's own democratic election code. The last election in Nelson House was in July 2014. The Chief is currently Marcel Moody, a former Councillor. About 3,000 members of the NCN live in Nelson House and the remaining 2,100 off the reserve lands. Until 2005, the community of South Indian Lake on the shores of Southern Indian Lake was also part of the NCN. In December 2005, this community of about 1,100 persons separated from the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation to form the O-Pipon-Na-Piwin Cree Nation. With a population of approximately 5,200, the NCN is a large and widespread community. Nelson House consists of nine areas, which are known to the residents as Hillside, Dogpoint, R.C. Point, Little R.C. Point, New Area, Hart's Point, Michelle Point, Bay Road and Moore's Bay. Like most of rural Canada where the population is sparse, there is no local infrastructure for water and sewage treatment. Rural residents in Canada must use private wells or take water from a lake or river and have their own septic tank. Hydroelectric development and impacts During the 1960s and 1970s, the Government of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro began the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project, centered on the Churchill and Nelson rivers. The project included the Churchill River Diversion, which directly affected Nisichawayasihk members living at Nelson House and at South Indian Lake. Consequently, large areas of traditional hunting, fishing and trapping lands were flooded. The people of South Indian Lake were forcibly relocated to their current location. The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) is a signatory to the Northern Flood Agreement (NFA) between Canada (the federal government), Manitoba Hydro, the Province of Manitoba and several First Nations Communities. In 1996, NCN signed an NFA Implementation Agreement. Using settlement proceeds paid pursuant to this implementation agreement, NCN purchased the Mystery Lake Motor Hotel in the nearby city of Thompson. In 2006, the NCN signed a Project Development Agreement with Manitoba Hydro regarding the Wuskwatim hydroelectric project on the Burntwood River, about 30 km from Nelson House. Wuskwatim generates about 200 MW of electricity. The NCN was involved in the construction of the project and, as a partner in the project, will receive a share of the future revenues. This arrangement is the first of its kind in Manitoba. In 2006, the Atoskiwin Training and Employment Centre (ATEC) opened its doors in Nelson House. ATEC is also a Manitoba first. It trains NCN members and other aboriginals for northern hydro projects and other job opportunities. Urban reserve In early February 2004, the nearby city of Thompson, Manitoba announced its approval to the NCN to convert a parcel of property to Treaty Land. This was possible due to shortages in land area controlled by NCN under the Treaty Land Entitlement agreement in the mid-1990s. This event will mark one of the few transitions from privately owned land, purchased by a First Nations community, to an Urban Reserve. This plan has been quietly discussed between city and band administration since the narrowly lost plebiscite held in Thompson on September 18, 2001. With a 45% voter turnout for the plebiscite, and amid allegations of inappropriate voter disqualifications, the \\"no\\" side won by a margin of 250 votes. During the three years following the plebiscite, the majority of Thompson City Councillors have publicly stated that the results of the vote were not binding upon city council, as the council has been elected to act in the best interests of the citizens of Thompson.

Garrison served as vice-chancellor of New Jersey from 1904 to 1913, where he came to Governor Woodrow Wilson's notice. =Secretary of War= From March 5, 1913 to February 10, 1916, Garrison served as Secretary of War in the Wilson administration. Garrison and Wilson never fit well together. Garrison was much more willing to intervene militarily overseas than was the President. This was especially evident in regard to Mexico. Garrison urged American intervention into the Mexican revolution to restore order. During the Preparedness campaign of 1916, when Wilson was trying to convince Congress to raise military spending, Garrison supported a plan for expanding the US military with what he called the Continental Army Plan. Garrison's proposal would establish a standing army of 140,000 and a national, volunteer reserve force of 400,000 men. Wilson initially gave the plan tepid support, but Garrison ran into opposition from both those who felt his plan went too far in creating a large standing army, as well as from those who felt it did not go far enough. Wilson was convinced by allies in Congress to back an alternative plan which emphasized not Garrison's national volunteer force, but a continued role for the states' National Guard. Garrison resigned in February 1916 over these differences. =Later years= Emil Fuchs, 1917 After leaving Wilson's administration Garrison returned to the practice of law in the firm of Hornblower, Miller & Garrison. He was appointed receiver of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company in December 1918 and served until June 1923. He died on October 19, 1932, at his home in Sea Bright, New Jersey.Staff. \\"LINDLEY M.

Parakeet Auklets used to be placed on its own in the genus Cyclorrhynchus (Kaup, 1829) but recent morphological and genetic evidence suggest it should be placed in the genus Aethia, making them closely related to crested auklets and least auklets. It is associated with the boreal waters of Alaska, Kamchatka and Siberia. It breeds on the cliffs, slopes and boulder fields of offshore islands, generally moving south during the winter. Description The parakeet auklet is a small (23 cm) auk with a short orange bill that is upturned to give the bird its curious fixed expression. The upward bend of the beak has been observed to provide advantages in picking up small food pieces from the sea bottom as well as in assisting in the disintegration of larger food objects. The bird's plumage is dark above and white below. with a single white plume projecting back from the eye. There is a small amount of variation between breeding and winter plumage. The parakeet auklet is a highly vocal species at the nest, calling once it arrives at the nest and then duetting once its mate arrives. It makes a series of rhythmic hoarse calls (like that of the Cassin's auklet) and a quavering squeal. The function of these are unknown, but could be associated with defending its burrow from intruders and strengthening the bond with its mate. Behaviour and breeding The parakeet auklet is highly social in its breeding colonies. The parakeet auklet's food varies with season, during the breeding season it takes mostly small planktonic crustaceans such as euphausiids, copepods and amphipods. Recent research shows it also preys on jellyfish in some areas. It often feeds at a considerable distance from the colony, diving up to 30 m to reach its prey. Breeding begins in April and May in colonies that are often shared with other auk species. The pair lay one egg, which is incubated for just over a month, the chick is then fed 4 times a day for around 35 days. The chick fledges at night, flying out to sea alone. Status and conservation Closeup of the head, Pribilof Islands, Alaska The parakeet auklet is not considered threatened, there are estimated to be over a million individuals in the North Pacific. It is not thought to have declined recently, but may be threatened in the future by introduced predators and oil spills. References * Collinson, Martin. 2006. Splitting headaches?

Starting from Nimitz Highway near Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, it serves the island's older western suburbs, turning north across the O‚Äòahu Central Valley to the North Shore. At the North Shore, Kamehameha Highway heads northeast around the northern tip of O‚Äòahu, then southeast to and just beyond KƒÅne‚Äòohe Bay on the windward coast. The road was named after King Kamehameha I. A short detached segment of the Kamehameha Highway exists for a few blocks in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kalihi. This segment runs as a short extension of Dillingham Boulevard from Puuhale Road (near the Oahu Community Correctional Center) to exit 18B on Interstate H-1. This section was contiguous with the rest of the highway before the construction of the H-1 viaduct. Route description =Route 99 (Honolulu to Haleiwa)= As Route 99, Kamehameha Highway begins at its southern terminus at the Pearl Harbor interchange of Interstate H-1 near Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base. The highway runs north past the Pearl Harbor historic sites such as the USS Arizona Memorial and the , the Admiral Clarey Bridge to Ford Island leading to the , and Aloha Stadium. The highway then turns west through the suburbs of Aiea and Pearl City, passing Pearlridge Center, the state's second largest shopping mall. After passing Pearl City and the interchange with Interstate H-2 near Waipahu, Route 99 turns north through the central O'ahu suburbs of Waipio and Mililani. South of WahiawƒÅ near Wheeler Army Airfield, the named Kamehameha Highway continues through WahiawƒÅ as Route 80, while Route 99 (as Wilikina Drive and Kamananui Road) bypasses WahiawƒÅ on the west, rejoining Kamehameha Highway north of Whitmore Village. It then continues north through pineapple fields and former sugar cane fields to the junction with Route 83 near Haleiwa. =Route 80 (Wahiawa)= As Route 80, Kamehameha Highway begins at the interchange with Interstate H-2 and Route 99 and passes through central WahiawƒÅ and passing Whitmore Village before rejoining Route 99 north of Wahiawa. =Route 83 (Haleiwa to Kaneohe)= Kamehameha Highway street sign in Hawaii Originally, Kamehameha Highway continued as Route 83 at the junction with Route 99 at Weed Junction in Haleiwa, passing through Haleiwa up the North Shore. Since 1996, Route 83 begins inland from Weed Junction as the Joseph P. Leong Highway and bypasses Haleiwa town on the inland side, rejoining Kamehameha Highway north of Haleiwa. From Haleiwa, Kamehameha Highway passes Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach, and the Turtle Bay Resort at the northern tip of O'ahu before heading down the Windward Coast communities of Lai'e, Hau'ula, Punalu'u, and Ka'a'awa. At Kahalu'u, Kamehameha Highway follows the coastline through He'eia and the main commercial district of Kaneohe (this segment was formerly Route 836), while Route 83 continues as Kahekili Highway bypassing Kaneohe town to the west before reaching the junction with Likelike Highway (Route 63). Route 83 rejoins Kamehameha Highway in Kaneohe and continues south to the interchange with Interstate H-3 and the eastern terminus at Route 61. =Route 830= Hawaii Route 830 is a north-south route on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2000. In the episode, a snowstorm traps the students with principal Seymour Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie in Springfield Elementary. When Skinner uses his army skills to control the students, they overthrow him and take over the school. Meanwhile, Homer and Ned set out to rescue the children using Ned's car. \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. While the episode's premise is based on an occurrence in Long's childhood, the setpiece came from staff writer Matt Selman. Because the episode takes place in winter, Kramer found it difficult to animate. It features references to Smilla's Sense of Snow, The Deer Hunter and Kristi Yamaguchi, among other things. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 8.8 million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the home video release, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Plot While the Simpson family attends a French Canadian circus called \\"Cirque de Pur√©e\\", a wild blizzard hits Springfield, turning it into a snowsquall overnight, and the circus is cut short. All the local schools have closed, except Springfield Elementary School. Only some students, including the classmates of Bart and Lisa, show up while Skinner and Willie are the only faculty members at the school that day. To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favorite film, a very low- budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has very little to do with Christmas. By the time the DVD of the movie catches fire in the projector, it is already the end of the school day, and Skinner lets the kids go home ‚Äî however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids. While waiting for the snow to melt, Skinner tries to keep the children under control, forcing them to stay together in the cafeteria and eat apples, relish and (only if they behave well enough) mayonnaise. After Nelson tries to escape, Skinner unearths his U.S. Army memorabilia and is reminded of the days when he commanded respect from his troops. Skinner tries to command respect from the students, and briefly succeeds after threatening to hang them in their clothes on hooks on the wall if they rebel. Bart tries to tunnel his way out, but Skinner stops him and destroys the tunnel, only to get stuck in the resulting cave-in. The students rebel and tie Skinner up in a dodge ball bag as they take total control of the school; even burning numerous books in the school's library. Meanwhile, Homer, with the help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the children, driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough, but crashes the car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes it in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Ned and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. Skinner uses the school hamster, Nibbles, to get a message from the school to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process. Superintendent Chalmers appears and is ready to scold Skinner for the school's current poor state when Bart takes the blame, amending things with Skinner. As he and Lisa leave with Homer and Ned and Ned's sons, Homer starts hallucinating again making him see Lisa as a camel and Bart as a dancing girl. Homer tries to kiss Bart, who tries his best to escape, causing the car to lose control and crash, and camel Lisa then says \\"Merry Christmas from the Simpsons\\"! Production Homer and Ned listen to Bad Company while driving to school \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2000.Long, Tim. (2009). Commentary for \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The idea for the episode came from Long. One winter during his childhood, Exeter, Ontario, where Long lived, was hit by a blizzard. Much to his dismay, Long found out that all schools except Exeter Public School, which he went to, got closed (in the U.S., schools are closed entirely at the County or District level, so the real-life situation did not apply here, as it was shown Principal Skinner had the authority to open the school and even to have Otto work his usual bus route). Eventually, Long and his classmates were snowed in with the school's staff. \\"It was hellish, but then became a sweet thing\\", he said. \\"A couple of the dads braved the cold and brought us food on snowmobiles. So it was sweet.\\" Two years after Long pitched the premise, staff writer Matt Selman pitched the episode's setpiece, which revolves around the Simpsons' visit to Cirque du Pur√©e. \\"I pitched [the setpiece] to Tim [Long] when we were pitching around ideas\\", Selman said in the episode's DVD commentary. \\"And I said, 'What about a Cirque du Soleil parody?'\\"Selman, Matt. (2009). Commentary for \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The staff then decided to combine the two stories, and production on \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" ensued. In order to make a faithful rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer.Kramer, Lance. (2009). Commentary for \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an \\"amazing\\" job animating the setpiece.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. \\"It just adds another element\\", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, \\"People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And you have to make sure the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work.\\" The scratches and bad quality of \\"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was\\" were added in by the Post- Production Department, led by Alex Duke. \\"Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit,\\" Scully said, \\"But they'll take a film like ['The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was'] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. They always do a great job.\\" The woman in \\"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was\\" was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Pur√©e was voiced by Hank Azaria. The song that plays when Homer and Ned are driving to the school is \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" by English rock band Bad Company, which Homer claims to have written \\"as a tribute to Princess Di and Dodi\\". Originally, the series' staff wanted to use \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" by American rock band Kiss, but they failed to obtain the rights to use it. Cultural references Although the episode's title is a reference to the Danish mystery novel Smilla's Sense of Snow, there are no other allusions to the book in the episode.Pross, Max. (2009). Commentary for \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a circus called Cirque du Puree. The circus is a reference to the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil. The film the students watch, \\"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was\\" (the title of which is a reference to the 1966 film The Christmas That Almost Wasn't), is a reference to B-Grade 50's and 60's themed Christmas movies such as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Within the film, one of the hobgoblins has a similar singing voice as American singer Nelson Eddy. Having just found out that they are trapped in the school, Skinner says \\"I don't care if you're Kristi Yamaguchi - no one leaves the building\\". According to Long, the line was written by either Dana Gould or George Meyer, both of whom are former staff writers. While wreaking havoc in the school, Milhouse can be seen doodling a mustache on a picture of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. While ordering Skinner to humiliate himself, Bart says \\"Di, di, mau\\". This is a reference to the 1978 drama film The Deer Hunter, in which the Vietcong says the line to their captives. One of the books that the children burn in the school's library is the 1944 children's novel Johnny Tremain by Esther Forbes.Groening, Matt. (2009).

Release and reception In its original American broadcast on December 17, 2000, \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" received an 8.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8.8 million viewers. The episode finished in 33rd place in the ratings for the week of December 11-17, 2000, tying with an episode of the ABC sitcom The Drew Carey Show. Since its broadcast, the episode has been released twice on home video. On November 2, 2004, it was released along with \\"Homer vs. Dignity\\", \\"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\\" and \\"'Tis the 15th Season\\" as part of a DVD set entitled The Simpsons - Christmas 2. On August 18, 2009, the episode was again released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Tim Long, Matt Selman, David Mirkin, Max Pross and Lance Kramer participated in the audio commentary for the episode. Following its home video release, \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire wrote that, while he prefers \\"down-to-Earth\\" episodes, the more \\"outrageous\\" episodes like \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" are the ones that are \\"standouts\\". He added that the episode \\"provides a lot of solid 'cool kids versus dorky adults' comedy\\", and that the setpiece was the best part of the episode. Matt Haigh of Den of Geek described the episode as \\"gold\\", and considers it to be one of the season's best episodes. The staff of The Journal, while reviewing The Simpsons - Christmas 2 DVD set, described the episode as \\"memorable\\", and John McMurtrie of the San Francisco Chronicle cited it as \\"great\\". Elizabeth Skipper, another reviewer for DVD Verdict, wrote that most episodes that center around Skinner are \\"a sure thing\\", and that \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" is no exception. Both Aaron Beierle and Jason Bailey of DVD Talk argued that \\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\\" is one of the best episodes of the season. However, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as \\"mediocre\\". Although he found the children's revolt against Skinner amusing, he argued that the premise was not used to its full potential. He concluded his review by calling it \\"a fairly average program\\".

A Haitian policeman with a UN brassard, 2008 A brassard or armlet is an armband or piece of cloth or other material worn around the upper arm; the term typically refers to an item of uniform worn as part of military uniform or by police or other uniformed persons. Unit, role or rank badges or other insignia are carried on it instead of being stitched into the actual clothing. The brassard, when spread out, may be roughly rectangular in shape, where it is worn merely around the arm; it may also be a roughly triangular shape, in which case the brassard is also attached to a shoulder strap. The term is originally French, deriving from bras meaning \\"arm\\". Brassards are also used with the uniforms of organizations which are not military but which are influenced by and styled upon the military, such as police, emergency services, volunteer services, or militaristic societies and political parties. A brassard is often used: * to temporarily attach insignia, such as rank, to clothing not normally bearing insignia (such as civilian clothing or a military mechanic's coveralls); * to temporarily attach insignia to a uniform for a limited time, such as the insignia for an \\"officer of the day\\" or \\"duty officer\\"; or for uniforms expected to have a high turnover of either wearer or insignia borne, such as those of cadets or other youth organizations. Brassards worn by military police and Red Cross personnel fall under this category. Brassard (also \\"brassart\\" or \\"brasset\\") is also used to refer to pieces of armour worn to cover the entire arm (encompassing vambrace, rerebrace, and possibly a couter).

Keeping the rat population under control was practiced in Europe to prevent the spread of diseases, most notoriously the Black Plague, and to prevent damage to food supplies. In modern developed countries, such a professional is otherwise known as a pest control operative or pest exterminator. Anecdotal history Anecdotal reports suggest that some rat-catchers in Europe would raise rats instead of catching them in order to increase their eventual payment from the town or city they were employed by. This, and the practice of rat-fights, could have led to rat-breeding and the adoption of the rat as a pet‚Äîthe fancy rat.

Techniques  Professional rat-catchers behind a pile of dead rats, during the outbreak of bubonic plague in Sydney in 1900 Rat-catchers may attempt to capture rats themselves, or release \\"ratters\\", animals trained or naturally skilled at catching them. They may also set a rat trap or other traps. Modern methods of rat control include traps, poisoned bait, introducing predators, reducing litter and clearing of current or potential nest sites. =Ratters= A \\"ratter\\" usually refers to a dog used for catching or killing rats. This includes specially-bred terriers for vermin-hunting, which may be known as rat terriers, although the latter may refer to a breed that was historically developed in rat-baiting context. =Conditions and risks= Rats are rarely seen in the open, preferring to hide in holes, haystacks and dark locations. A rat-catcher's risk of being bitten is high, as is the risk of acquiring a disease from a rat bite.

Established in 1892, the ULC aims to provide U.S. states (plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) with well- researched and drafted legislation to bring clarity and stability to critical areas of statutory law across jurisdictions. The ULC promotes enactment of uniform acts in areas of state law where uniformity is desirable and practical. The ULC headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois. The ULC consists of approximately 350 commissioners appointed by each U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All of its members are lawyers, who may also serve as legislators, judges, or legal scholars. Each is appointed to the Commission by the government of their respective state or territory. Every ULC commissioner must be an attorney. Each jurisdiction determines the method of appointment and its number of commissioners. In most states, the governor appoints the state's commissioners to serve a specified term. In a few states, ULC commissioners serve at the will of the appointing authority and have no specific term. ULC commissioners are volunteers who do not receive salaries or other compensation for their public service. The ULC is best known for its work on the landmark Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), drafted in conjunction with the American Law Institute. Since the ULC first convened in 1892, it has produced more than 300 uniform acts. These acts focus on commercial law, family and domestic relations law, estates, probate and trusts, real estate, alternate dispute resolution, and many other areas of the law. Among the ULC's most widely adopted acts are the Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, and the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act. The current ULC President is Anita Ramasastry of Seattle, Washington, the Chair of the ULC's Executive Committee is Carl H. Lisman of Burlington, Vermont and the Chair of the Scope and Program Committee is Daniel Robbins of Sherman Oaks, California. Richard Cassidy of Burlington, Vermont is the Immediate Past President. History ULC headquarters, Chicago The uniform law movement began in the latter half of the 19th century. The Alabama State Bar Association recognized as early as 1881 that wide variations in law between separate states often created confusion. In 1889, the New York Bar Association appointed a special committee on uniformity of laws. In 1890 the New York Legislature authorized the then-Governor of New York, Roswell Flower, to appoint three commissioners \\"to examine certain subjects of national importance that seemed to show conflict among the laws of the several commonwealths, to ascertain the best means to effect an assimilation or uniformity in the laws of the states and territories, and especially whether it would be advisable for the State of New York to invite the other states of the Union to send representatives to a convention to draft uniform laws to be submitted for approval and adoption by the several states.\\" The American Bar Association held its 12th Annual Meeting the same year and adopted a resolution recommending each state provide for commissioners to confer with the commissioners of other states on the uniformity of legislation on certain subjects. In August 1892, the first session of the organization that became the Uniform Law Commission was held at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York. The gathering took place before the annual summer meeting of the American Bar Association, a tradition that continues. The gathering brought together delegates from seven states: Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. They titled themselves the \\"Conference of the State Boards of Commissioners on Promoting Uniformity of Law in the U.S.\\" By 1912, every state was participating in the Commission. The United States Virgin Islands was the last jurisdiction to join, appointing its first commissioner in 1988. In each year of service, the ULC has steadily increased its contribution to state and territorial law. It quickly became known as a distinguished body of lawyers. In 1901, Woodrow Wilson became a member. Several commissioners later became Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Louis Brandeis, Wiley Blount Rutledge, and William H. Rehnquist. Several noted legal scholars have also been members, e.g. John Wigmore, Samuel Williston, Roscoe Pound, and John Bogart. The distinguished membership of the ULC has helped to ensure the quality of its work and made it enormously influential. In 1940, the ULC moved to dispel confusion in U.S. commercial law with a comprehensive solution. This project led the ULC to partner with the American Law Institute to create the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The Code took ten years to complete. After another 14 years, it had been enacted in every state. It remains the signature product of the Commission. Since its organization, the ULC has drafted more than 300 uniform laws on numerous subjects and in various fields of law, setting patterns for uniformity across the nation. Today, the Commission is recognized primarily for its work in commercial law, family law, real property law, the law of probate and estates, the law of business organizations, health law, and conflicts of law; it rarely drafts regulatory law. Uniform acts include the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, Uniform Probate Code, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, the Uniform Partnership Act, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The ULC has also experienced its share of failures. In the 1970s, the ULC dedicated an enormous amount of time and effort to the cause of comprehensive reform of U.S. real property law, which then and now varies dramatically from one state to the next. The ULC's generous and well-intended efforts were utterly futile; most of its Uniform Acts on the subject were never enacted in any state, and only bits and pieces were enacted in a handful of states.Marion W. Benfield, Jr., Wasted Days and Wasted Nights: Why the Land Acts Failed, 20 Nova L. Rev. 1037, 1037‚Äì41 (1996).Ronald Benton Brown, Whatever Happened to the Uniform Land Transactions Act? 20 Nova L.

Procedure for drafting and promulgating proposed uniform laws \\"It must be emphasized that the [ULC] can only propose‚Äîno uniform law is effective until a state legislature adopts it.\\" Frequently, a state will make substantial variations when adopting a uniform act.See, e.g., Payne v. Stalley, 672 So. 2d 822, 823 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995), in which a Michigan lawyer overlooked the fact that Florida, when adopting the Uniform Probate Code, made a change in the procedure applicable to claims against an estate, and, as a result, an otherwise valid claim for approximately $3.7 million was denied as late. Proposals for a new uniform act or model act are considered by the Committee on Scope and Program, which welcomes suggestions from the organized bar, state government entities, private interest groups, uniform law commissioners and private individuals. It may assign a suggested topic to a Study Committee, which reviews and researches the proposal and reports back to the Scope and Program Committee. Scope and Program sends its recommendations to the Executive Committee. If a recommendation to create or amend an act is approved, a Drafting Committee is selected and a reporter/drafter ‚Äì an expert in the field ‚Äì is hired. Advisors and participating observers are solicited to assist every Drafting Committee. Draft acts are submitted for initial debate of the entire Commission at the ULC's Annual Meeting. Each act must be considered section by section at no less than two annual meetings by all commissioners sitting as a Committee of the Whole. The commissioners may offer amendments and corrections to the proposed act. Once the Committee of the Whole approves an act, it is presented for a vote by the states. Each of the 53 state and territory delegations caucuses its members and casts one vote. The proposed act must be approved (1) by no fewer than 20 jurisdictions; and, (2) by a majority of the states and territories present before it is officially approved as a uniform or model act. At this point, the act is officially promulgated for consideration by the states and territories. Legislatures are urged to adopt uniform acts exactly as written to \\"promote uniformity in the law among the jurisdictions adopting the act.\\" Model acts are designed to serve as a guideline for legislation that states and territories can borrow from or adapt to suit their individual needs and conditions. Once an act is adopted by the ULC, it is usually presented to the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association for its endorsement. Upon its endorsement, the ULC Legislative Council advocates adoption of the act in the various states and territories. The work of the ULC simplifies the legal life of businesses and individuals by providing rules and procedures that are consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Representing both state and territorial government and the legal profession, it has sought to bring uniformity to the divergent legal traditions of 53 sovereign jurisdictions, and has done so with significant success. Financial support The major portion of the ULC's financial support comes from state and territorial government appropriations. Expenses are apportioned among the member jurisdictions by means of an annual assessment based on population. The ULC budget is supplemented by publishing royalties and by grants to support specific projects from foundations or the federal government. The ULC's minimal budget is sufficient because most of its legal expertise is donated by the commissioners. Commissioners devote thousands of hours‚Äîamounting in some cases to millions of dollars worth of time‚Äîto the development of uniform and model acts. No jurisdiction could afford the cost of this legal expertise on its own.

Biography He was son of the Church of Scotland minister of Troqueer near Dumfries, and was one of eleven children. His brother Joseph Ewart became British ambassador to Prussia; John, a doctor, became Chief Inspector of East India Company hospitals in India; and William, father of William Ewart, was business partner of Sir John Gladstone, father of William Ewart Gladstone, whose godfather he was and whom he was named after. Following graduation from the University of Edinburgh, he was apprenticed to millwright John Rennie. His work with water wheels led him to work with Matthew Boulton and James Watt for whom by 1790 he was agent in Manchester. At the same time as acting as agent he was also trading on his own account as a millwright, enabling him to provide the complementary shafts, gears and other necessities to harness the power of the Boulton & Watt steam engines. In 1792, frustrated in administering the immature and, as yet, unreliable machinery, he left Boulton and Watt to work in partnership with Samuel Oldknow in a cotton bleaching and calico printing venture. He anticipated this being a profitable concern but the partnership was dissolved within a year and he returned to engineering. In 1798 he went into partnership with Samuel Greg, installing an innovative water wheel at Greg's Quarry Bank Mill on the River Bollin in Cheshire. As a standby, he installed a Watt steam engine. By 1811, Ewart had abandoned the venture with Greg to concentrate on his own manufacturing business but also his scientific work. He became, along with John Dalton, a vice-president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and became active in the contemporary controversies about heat, work and energy. Motivated by a paper of John Playfair and encouraged by Dalton, in 1813 he published \\"On the measure of moving force\\" in which he defended the nascent ideas of the conservation of energy championed by John Smeaton. The paper was strongly to influence Dalton's pupil James Prescott Joule. A vocal advocate of the application of scientific knowledge in engineering, he was one of the founders of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute. Ewart took up the post of Chief Engineer and Chief Inspector of Machinery with the Admiralty in 1835 and died on 15 September 1842 at Woolwich Dockyard when a chain snapped as he was supervising the removal of a boiler.

Background The flag of Irish Republican Brotherhood, the organisation Clan na Gael was directly tied to for many decades As Irish immigration to the United States of America began to increase in the 18th century many Irish organizations were formed. One of the earliest was formed under the name of the Irish Charitable Society and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1737. These new organizations went by varying names, most notably the Ancient and Most Benevolent Order of the Friendly Brothers of Saint Patrick, founded in New York in 1767, the Society of the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick for the Relief of Emigrants in Philadelphia in 1771, and the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick also formed in New York in 1784. In the later part of the 1780s, a strong Irish patriot (rather than Catholic) character began to grow in these organizations and amongst recently arrived Irish immigrants. The usage of Celtic symbolism helped solidify this sense of nationalism and was most noticeably found in the use of the name \\"Hibernian.\\" (Hibernia is the Latin name for Ireland.) In 1858, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) had been founded in Dublin by James Stephens. The initial decision to create this organization came about after Stephens consulted, through special emissary Joseph Denieffe, with John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny, members of a precursor group called the Emmet Monument Association. In response to the establishment of the IRB in Dublin, a sister organization was founded in New York City, the Fenian Brotherhood, led by O'Mahony. This arm of Fenian activity in America produced a surge in radicalism among groups of Irish immigrants, many of whom had recently emigrated from Ireland during and after the Great Hunger. In October, 1865, the Fenian Philadelphia Congress met and appointed the Irish Republican Government in the US. But in 1865, in Ireland, the IRB newspaper The Irish People had been raided by the police and the IRB leadership was imprisoned. Another abortive uprising would occur in 1867, but the British remained in control. After the 1865 crackdown in Ireland, the American organization began to fracture over what to do next. Made up of veterans of the American Civil War, a Fenian army had been formed. While O'Mahony and his supporters wanted to remain focused on supporting rebellions in Ireland a competing faction, called the Roberts, or senate wing, wanted this Fenian Army to attack British bases in Canada. The resulting Fenian Raids strained US‚ÄìBritish relations. The level of American support for the Fenian cause began to diminish as the Fenians were seen as a threat to stability in the region. The Irish were still seen as a foreign people within the borders of the American state by anti-Catholic Americans such as members of the Know-Nothing Party; their existence within America was seen primarily as temporary camps of immigrants who planned to stay in America only as long as the British stayed in Ireland. Upon the British withdrawal from Irish soil, it was believed, the Irish immigrants would return to their native land. The Fenian Raids were seen as an astonishing example of immigrant activity in US history and Irish nationalism has itself become something of an exception among the American melting pot. Very few US immigrants concerned themselves with their mother country as did the Irish; in March 1868, 100,000 Fenian supporters held an anti-British demonstration in New York. Creation of Clan na Gael After 1867, the Irish Republican Brotherhood headquarters in Manchester chose to support neither of the existing feuding factions, but instead promoted a renewed Irish republican organization in America, to be named Clan na Gael. According to John Devoy in 1924, Jerome James Collins founded what was then called the Napper Tandy Club in New York on 20 June 1867, Wolfe Tone's birthday. This club expanded into others and at one point at a picnic in 1870 was named the Clan na Gael by Sam Cavanagh. This was the same Cavanagh who killed the informer George Clark,Gaelic American, 7 January 1905 who had exposed a Fenian pike-making operation in Dublin to the police. Collins, who died in 1881 on the disastrous Jeannette Expedition to the North Pole, was a science editor on the New York Herald, who had left England in 1866 when a plot he was involved in to free the Fenian prisoners at Pentonville Prison was uncovered by the police. Collins believed at the time of the founding in 1867 that the two feuding Fenians branches should patch things up.Much of the preceding is found in the Gaelic American, 29 Dec 1906, in an article entitled \\"The Inside Story of the Jeanette Horror\\". Both John O'Mahony and William R Roberts, opposing leaders of fighting branches of the Fenians, belonged to the Napper Tandy Club, according to Devoy in the aforementioned article.  Catalpa rescue  After arriving in America in 1871 John Devoy indicated he joined the Clan na Gael early on and attempted several times at Clan conventions to get the Clan to adopt a plan to free the military prisoners held by the British in Fremantle Australia. In 1874 John Devoy, with some oratorical help from Thomas Francis Bourke, was elected Chairman of the Executive Board of the Clan and was also chosen to execute the rescue of the prisoners. Bourke warned Devoy that there would be \\"kickers\\" and he would have to have a heavy hand to control the Clan na Gael and succeed in the project.Proceedings of the United Brotherhood Convention, Cleveland Ohio September 1874 held at the Fenian archives at the Catholic University of America. John Devoy devoted all his time to this project and oversaw the purchase of the bark Catalpa and the outfitting of this ship as a whaler. The Clan hired American George S. Anthony as its ship captain along with a New Bedford-based whaling crew. John received considerable help in running the Clan from Dr. William Carroll who was elected Executive Board Chairman in 1875 and between them they controlled Clan activity until 1882. Carroll was of Ulster Protestant stock and brought in others to the Clan from the upper middle class such as Simon Barclay Conover, Senator from Florida. Devoy's nemesis during the fund raising for the enterprise was John Goff, an aspiring Clan member who later became a New York Supreme Court Judge and who, perhaps, resented the influence of Bourke and Devoy in the Clan. Devoy did in fact take a strong hand and began tossing out Clan members for malfeasance in office and violation of Clan rules as is shown in \\"General Circular No. 2\\" dated 15 January 1875.NLI MS. 18,015(1): John Devoy Papers. For more on the Catalpa rescue see Sean O'Lung \\"Fremantle Mission\\", Philip Fennell and Marie King (Eds.) \\"John Devoy's Catalpa Expedition\\", a transcription of John Devoy's Catalpa Story in the Gaelic American, and ZW Pease's \\"The Catalpa Expedition\\" the latter published by George Anthony the Captain aboard the ship. The success of the rescue in 1876 resulted in the Clan na Gael replacing for all practical purposes the Fenian Brotherhood as the spokesman of Irish-American nationalism. Under the leadership of John Devoy, Clan na Gael would eventually be successful in educating Americans about the movement. New Departure 1879 John Devoy became a key figure in Clan na Gael in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries In 1879, Devoy promoted a \\"New Departure\\" in Irish republican thinking, by which the \\"physical force party\\" allied itself with the Irish Parliamentary Party under the political leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, MP; the political plans of the Fenians were thus combined with the agrarian revolution inaugurated by the Irish National Land League. The arrangement was cemented at the first Irish Race Convention held in Chicago in 1881. By 1880, more aggressive men within the Clan na Gael were chafing at the slow pace of Devoy and Carroll and these men were able to take control of the organization in 1882 when two \\"action men\\", Alexander Sullivan and Michael Boland took over the reins and ran the clan as a dictatorship along with an inactive Mr. Feeley. The new leadership ignored the Revolutionary Council set up by Carroll to coordinate between the IRB and the Clan and began to operate in total secrecy from even the membership of the Clan. These three men called themselves the \\"Triangle\\" and began making bombing runs into England in what was called the \\"Dynamite War\\". This infuriated the IRB in Ireland which cut ties with the Irish-Americans. Michael Boland was later pointed out as a British spy which might have explained why the majority of the bombers were caught and jailed before they could strike.McGee, Owen. The IRB. Four Courts Press, Dublin. 2006 pp 105-8Devoy, \\"Story of the Clan na Gael,\\" Gaelic American 29 November 1924 The 1880s saw the solidification, at least within America, of Irish ideological orientations, with most nationalist sentiment finding its home within Clan na Gael, rather than organizations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The more agrarian-minded found their ideological brethren within the Irish Federation of America. The third ideological strand was connected to the union and socialist movement and found support with the Knights of Labor. In the late 1880s a financial scandal in the Chicago branch of the Clan led to a successful conspiracy to murder whistle-blower Dr. Patrick Henry Cronin. John Devoy, who worked with Cronin, also began carrying a gun and expected to be assassinated by Alexander Sullivan's henchmen. The Cronin case, prosecuted by State's Attorney Joel Minnick Longenecker achieved international attention. Neither the prosecution nor the defense were concerned with the Clan's ties to the Fenians, trying the case simply as a conspiracy to commit murder.McEnnis, John T. The Clan na Gael and the Murder of Dr. Cronin. (The original book had no publisher information, however a preliminary subscriber list indicates it was to be published in 1889 by John W Liff & Co. of Chicago, Illinois) The Clan na Gael had split into pro and anti Sullivan/Boland branches, but was re- united by John Devoy around 1900. In Ireland the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) achieved electoral success in the 1880s, and was supported by the British Prime Minister William Gladstone who introduced the unsuccessful Government of Ireland Bill 1886. Gladstone's party then divided over home rule, and the IPP also divided for a decade over Parnell's marriage to Mrs. O'Shea. In 1891, a moderate offshoot of the Clan na Gael broke away and formed an organization under the name of Irish National Federation of America with T. Emmet as president. The federation supported the National Party in Ireland, a splinter group of Parnell's Home Rule Party. Rising to prominence within the Clan from the 1890s were Daniel Cohalan (later to be a Judge of the New York Supreme Court) and Joseph McGarrity. In the 20th century Joseph McGarrity became the leader of Clan na Gael following splits mirroring those in Ireland caused by the Irish Civil War The objective of Clan na Gael was to secure an independent Ireland and to assist the Irish Republican Brotherhood in achieving this aim. To this end, the Clan was prepared to enter into alliances with any nation allied against the British; with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Clan found its greatest ally in Imperial Germany. A delegation led by Devoy met with the German Ambassador in the US Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and his aide Franz von Papen in 1914. This was followed by an emissary John Kenny, sent on a mission to Berlin to discuss how the German war effort and Irish Nationalism could cooperate. Devoy, along with Roger Casement and Joseph McGarrity, was able to bring together both Irish- American and German support in the years prior to the Easter Rising. However the German munitions never reached Ireland as the ship Aud carrying them was scuttled after being intercepted by the Royal Navy. Clan na Gael became the largest single financier of both the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence. Imperial Germany aided Clan na Gael by selling those guns and munitions to be used in the uprising of 1916. Germany had hoped that by distracting Britain with an Irish uprising they would be able to garner the upper hand in the war and affect a German victory on the Western Front. However, they failed to follow through with more support. Clan na Gael was also involved via McGarrity and Casement in the abortive attempt to raise an \\"Irish Brigade\\" to fight against the British. Some Sikhs held talks with Clan Na Gael, which led to authorities in Great Britain and India fearing Irish- Americans and Sikhs uniting against the British Empire. Clan Na Gael supported the primarily Sikh Ghadar Party, and played a supportive role in the Hindu German Conspiracy in the United States during World War I,Plowman, Matthew Erin. \\"Irish Republicans and the Indo-German Conspiracy of World War I,\\" New Hibernia Review 7.3 (2003) 81-105 which led to the Hindu German Conspiracy Trial in San Francisco in 1917‚Äì18. Clan Na Gael largely controlled the Irish Race Conventions from 1916, and its affiliated group the Friends of Irish Freedom. The Irish War of Independence led to a split in Clan na Gael which was precipitated in June 1920 by √âamon de Valera, who as President of the Irish Republic became involved in a dispute with Devoy and Judge Cohalan over lobbying US Presidential candidates on the issue of American recognition for the Irish Republic. To punish Woodrow Wilson for his apparent lack of support, the Clan backed Harding in the 1920 United States presidential election. In October, 1920, Harry Boland stated that the IRB in Ireland had terminated connections between the Clan and the parent body in Ireland until the will of D√°il √âireann was mirrored in Clan na Gael. Devoy and Cohalan refused to accept this but McGarrity disagreed, believing that without IRB support, the Clan was not legitimate, which led to a split. McGarrity, whose faction went by the name Reorganized Clan na Gael, supported the Anti-Treaty forces during the Civil War while Devoy and Cohalan supported the Free State. After 1924, when the IRB and the Devoy-Cohalan Clan na Gael both voted to disband, McGarrity's faction became the sole Clan na Gael. In 1926, the Clan na Gael formally associated with the reorganized Irish Republican Army in the same fashion as it had with the IRB. McGarrity continued to provide support and aid to the IRA after it was outlawed in Ireland by de Valera in 1936 but became less active in the 1940s and 1950s following McGarrity's death in 1940. However the organization grew in the 1970s. The organization played a key part in NORAID and was a prominent source of finance and weapons for the Provisional IRA during The Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969‚Äì1998. The Clan na Gael still exists today, much changed from the days of the Catalpa rescue and as recently as 1997 another internal split occurred as a result of the IRA shift away from using physical force as a result of the 1998 Good Friday peace accords, and before that over the abandonment of the policy of abstentionism in 1987.Ed Moloney, Clan na Gael split a worry for Sinn F√©in Published 9 May 2006. Accessed 17 March 2008. Presidents of the Clan na Gael From its founding in 1869, although heavily influenced by founder John Devoy over the years, the organization was nominally under the control of an executive committee headed by a national Executive Board Chairman. This executive committee was elected at yearly, later ever other year, conventions. At the convention held in Chicago during 1881, the committee was reduced to five members making it easier to control. The committee then came under the domination of Michael Boland, D.S. Freely and national executive chairman Alexander Sullivan who together were known as \\"the Triangle\\". The first Chairman perhaps should be Jerome Collins as the man who founded the first Club (D1) of what would later be called the Clan na Gael (these clubs later were called \\"Camps\\"). The club was named Napper Tandy after an Irish patriot. From the beginning, according to John Devoy in the Gaelic American, the secretary of Napper Tandy and later of the Clan na Gael was William James Nicholson. He was secretary from 1867 to 1874 when he was dismissed for loaning Camp Funds which were not repaid. According to a descendant of the John Haltigan the foreman printer of the Irish People, James Haltigan son of John Haltigan was Executive Board Chairman in 1871. In 1873 James Ryan was Executive Board Chairman.Devoys PostbagBP Vol. I p. 87‚Äì88. was he from Lawrence, Mass? (Devoy in the Gaelic American said the man who preceded him was from there and was a nonentity.) In 1874 John Devoy was chosen Executive Board Chairman at the Baltimore Convention. From 1875 until he resigned in 1879, John Devoy's trusted friend and ardent nationalist Dr. William Carroll of Philadelphia was Executive Board Chairman. James Reynolds of Connecticut temporarily held the post from Carroll's resignation until 1881 (there was no convention in 1880) when the Triangle of Sullivan, Feeley and Boland assumed command. Although Devoy supporters Reynolds and Treacy remained on the Executive Board, they were left out of the decision- making process by the Triangle. The Triangle's bombing campaign split the organization into two factions in the mid-1880s. After the murder of Cronin, the Clan na Gael united once again under John Devoy in 1900. John Kenny served as president of the Napper Tandy branch in 1883 and again in 1914.

An aerosol, the product uses a combination of silicones, waxes and solvents and is currently manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser. Alongside Australia, Mr Sheen is also available in Jamaica, Kenya, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as in Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Africa where it is called Mr Min and in Argentina where it is known as Mr Frend. The Mr Sheen character and branding, despite numerous revamps, has a high level of recognition amongst consumers, so much so that the company has been able to go for periods of time without even advertising the product, such as in the early 1990s.  History  Back in the 1950s, the Australian cleaning product market lacked any aerosol-based products, hence the development of Mr Sheen by Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd was the first such product to be offered in the Australian market. The popularity of Mr Sheen received a large boost when the advertising agency Hansen Rubensohn developed both a jingle and a character for the product in the late 1950s. The Australian character (supposedly modeled on one of Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd's employees at the time) was created by Vic Nicholson and Brian Henderson as a smiling, rosy-cheeked, short bald man with spectacles in a black suit; a jingle based on Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean was created at the same time by Bob Gibson and Jimmy White. Both the character and jingle have proved effective branding agents in Australia, where 95% of the populace capable of recognising the character and jingle as belonging to the Mr Sheen product range. In 1969, British multinational consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (then called Reckitt & Colman) acquired Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd; the new owners expanded the range of the product out to the United Kingdom and South Africa. The British version of the character is a cartoon caricature of a First World War biplane pilot (originally voiced by Willie Rushton in the television advertisements) who flies around the house on a dusting cloth cleaning tables, banisters and television sets, using the slogan \\"Mr Sheen shines umpteen things clean\\".

The relevant section is in Bonedd yr Arwyr (32) which describes Arthur and Cadwr as brawd vn vam (brothers of one mother), Cadwr being the son of Gwrlais, Earl of Cornwall. Peter Bartrum (ed.), Early Welsh Genealogical Tracts, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1966. p. 73-94. Historicity Many stories involving Arthurian figures were likely passed down orally, which has led to many different interpretations and versions of the people and characters mentioned.Lloyd-Morgan, Ceridwen, and Erich Poppe, editors. Arthur in the Celtic Languages: The Arthurian Legend in Celtic Literature and Traditions. Cardiff University of Wales Press, 2019. Books.Google, https://books.google.com/books?id=w-yVDwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false. Scholars generally question the historical accuracy of these tales. Evidence shows that people like Arthur may have been real historical figures. However, most of the deeds of Arthur have been discredited. Because of this, the people he is associated with and their stories could be solely a part of the orally passed down myths of Arthur's legacy and not true history. One of these figures was Cado, a successor of Geraint ab Erbin and a close associate of Arthur. Cador, the Duke of Cornwall, was a member that was summoned to Arthur's court. While it seems that Cador the Duke of Cornwall could have been a real historical figure, interpretations and stories that include him are very diverse in their information so understanding the true historical context of figures like him is difficult. Sources like King Arthur: The Truth Behind the Legend explain how the Arthurian history has been mixed with fact and fiction which means many events and figures could not have been accurate, > ‚ÄúThe Arthurian saga is nevertheless much more than a hotchpotch of tales > made up by medieval minstrels, and it is essential to try to separate the > Arthur of the romances‚Äîthe Arthur of Geoffrey of Monmouth, Thomas Malory and > the medieval troubadours‚Äîfrom the historical Arthur‚Äîthe dark age warrior on > whom all the rest of the super-structure was built‚Äù. Scholars were able to > narrow down the true historical facts of Arthur's life to two things, ‚Äú Some scholars have taken everything out, argued everything away, leaving just two brief mentions in the Easter Annals: 516: Battle of Badon, in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights, and the British were victors. 537: Strife of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut perished [or fell]‚Äù (King Arthur: The Truth Behind the Legend).

Name The name ‚ÄúCador‚Äù does not match any early Welsh sources, so the name itself comes either the misinterpretation of the Harley genealogy name ‚ÄúCatgur‚Äù or the British ‚ÄúCatigern‚Äù. Both names are interpreted similarly showing that the name Cador means \\"battle notable\\" or \\"fighter\\" due to the fact that ‚ÄúCat‚Äù means battle and ‚ÄúGur‚Äù means man or warrior while ‚ÄúTigern‚Äù means leader. Where the name Cador came from is a mystery due to the fact that it is not found in early Welsh sources, but it was very easy for letters to be dropped out of ‚ÄúCatgur‚Äù or ‚ÄúCatigern‚Äù causing the name Cador to be formed.Pace, Edwin. ‚ÄúGeoffrey of Monmouth‚Äôs Sources for the Cador and Camblan Narratives.‚Äù Arthuriana, vol. 24, no. 3, 2014, pp. 45‚Äì78.

His title Duke of Cornwall was also a title that took on different forms over history because Cornwall was once a part of the Roman civitas Dumnonia, giving Cador the name King of Dumnonia which is recognizable in many works. Origins and relations Cador was reputed to be the son of Geraint ( Latin Gerontius, Cornish Gerrens ) who a King of Dumnonia and an historic hero that died quite early leaving his rule to Hoel because Cador was not at a proper age for leadership. He was known to have children himself who go by the names Constantine (Welsh Custennin) Peredur, and Cadoc. He had shared lineage with King Arthur due to the fact that he was the great grandson of Arthur's Duke, based on the idea of Custennyn and Constantine genealogies being equivalent to each other.Ashely, Mike.

Cador is also thought to have been related to Arthur because he is addressed as so in different texts. Layamon, an English poet, writes that Arthur said, ‚ÄúCador, thou art mine own kin‚Äù(King Arthur's Children: A Study in Fiction and Tradition, pg.98). However, it is also made known in some works that Constantine, who was established to be Cador's son, was Arthur's cousin making Cador a possible in-law relative rather than through blood.Tichelaar, Tyler R..

Cador‚Äôs battles Cador's battles are not recorded in the Historia Brittonum Arthurian Battle list but are mentioned in many different works. He battled in Saxons, and oversea impending force to Arthur, as they were on their way to York. Before they reached that place, Cador used his army to defeat them and took over York. After the defeat, the Saxons surrender to a pledge of peace and retreat. The Saxons break the pledge of peace they made an oath to while on sea, which leads to another battle between the Saxons and Arthur. In that battle, Cador killed the Saxon leader named Chelric. His next big battle was at Camblan although there were a few little altercations in between like the Roman War. At the battle at Camblan, Cador is found dead with some of his troops, thus marking an end to his battles.Pace, Edwin. ‚ÄúGeoffrey of Monmouth‚Äôs Sources for the Cador and Camblan Narratives.‚Äù Arthuriana, vol. 24, no. 3, 2014, pp. 45‚Äì78.

Historia Regum Britanniae/Arthurian pseudohistory Cador, Duke of Cornwall, appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (ca. 1135). He is a man of power, as he is referred to as both a duke (dux) and a king (rex) throughout the text. He is known best for his heroism in the battles in York and Isle of Thanet told in Historia Regum Britanniae. Although he is highlighted for his great strength and involvement as a hero. None of Cador's battles appear in the Arthurian Battle list. The legitimacy and accuracy of Cador's involvement with these wars remain in question by scholars. He is successful in both battles, easily defeating the army in York as well as killing the leader of the Saxon barbarians, Chelric, overseas in the Isle of Thanet. Arthur's most successful siege, the battle in Bath, proceeds the battle at the Isle of Thanet which is strangely illogical given the timeline. Given that, Cador undermines the success of Arthur as he won against the Saxons in a far off region. Historians from both Saxon and Britain do not note on any battle occurring in that region until the sixth century. The legitimacy of this battle could be completely fabricated for literary purposes.Pace, Edwin. ‚ÄúGeoffrey of Monmouth‚Äôs Sources for the Cador and Camblan Narratives.‚Äù Arthuriana, vol. 24, no. 3, 2014, pp. 45‚Äì78.

Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Scholars have speculated that the legitimacy of Cador's battles can be found through the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, presumably written by Alfred the Great. Since there is only one named British Commander, Vortigern, scholars have aligned the timelines in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Historia Regum Britanniae to assess the legitimacy of Cador. Many similarities between the battles can be noted. There is an encounter in York, or along the Canterbury-London road with anywhere between 3,000 and 4,000 British soldiers. Here, Arthur and the British retreat to London in both versions of history. The next battle with the supposed Cador is in Thanet, which is noted in both Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Historia Regum Britanniae. The British Commander in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, despite being unnamed, is speculated to be the Cador in Historia Regum Britanniae because of the similarities.Pace, Edwin. ‚ÄúGeoffrey of Monmouth‚Äôs Sources for the Cador and Camblan Narratives.‚Äù Arthuriana, vol. 24, no. 3, 2014, pp. 45‚Äì78.

Historical ruler Cado was the historical son of a Dumnonian king named Gerrens whom he succeeded as monarch. Traditionally he was a good friend of Arthur; they even ruled together in the Vita Sanctus Carantoci (Life of St. Carantoc). He also seemed to share a good relationship with King Caradoc of Gwent. Possibly he gave his name to four hillforts, all named Cadbury which may be \\"Cado's fort\\", one each near to Clevedon, Congresbury and Sparkford in Somerset and one by the Exe in Devon north of Crediton. Cadson Buryhttp://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2243 hill fort lies just outside Callington, also known as Celliwig in Cornwall. Legend In Geoffrey's History and elsewhere, Arthur's future queen Guinevere was raised as Cador's ward. Cador is also said to be of Roman stock. His son Constantine was given the kingship of Britain by Arthur as the latter lay ailing on the field of Camlann. To the Brut Tysilio the translator adds the information that Cador was son of Gorlois, presumably by Igraine, which would make him Arthur's maternal half-brother. This same text also gives Cador a son, Mayric, who dies fighting the Romans. The same account appears in Richard Hardyng's Chronicle where Cador is called Arthur's brother \\"of his mother's syde.\\" In Layamon's Brut Cador appears as a leader who takes charge of Uther's host when they are attacked by Gorlois while Uther is secretly lying beside Igraine in Tintagel. Most works, such as the English Alliterative Morte Arthure and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, however, call Cador Arthur's \\"cousin\\", though in the Alliterative text Arthur calls Cador his sister's son. In The Dream of Rhonabwy, a medieval romance associated with the Mabinogion Cador is \\"Cadwr Earl of Cornwall, the man whose task it is to arm the king on the day of battle and conflict\\" ‚Äì i.e. at the Battle of Badon Hill, which the writer situates close to the upper River Severn.Jeffrey Gantz (translator), The Dream of Rhonabwy, from The Mabinogion, Penguin, 18 November 1976.

Introduced in 1961, the cereal is distinguished by its characteristic brown checkered squares in a finer pattern than Chex cereal. Advertisements for Life cereal sport the slogan \\"Life is full of surprises\\". , with the advent of numerous specialty varieties, the original cereal is now marketed as \\"Life Original Multigrain Cereal\\" with 20 grams of whole grains promoted in a red heart symbol. There is also the claim that: \\"Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods and low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease.\\" History of advertising  Life was popularized during the 1970s by an advertising campaign featuring \\"Little Mikey\\", a hard-to-please four-year-old boy portrayed by John Gilchrist. His two older brothers were portrayed by his real-life brothers, Michael and Tommy.\\"'Hey Mikey!' 15 years later, Life cereal kid is back\\", Anchorage Daily News, October 17, 1986 The commercials featured the slogan/catchphrase \\"He likes it! Hey Mikey!\\" The ad campaign was created by ad firm Doyle Dane and Bernbach. The campaign ran from 1972 to 1986, becoming one of the longest- running television advertisements in history. As recently as 1999, the commercial was included in a list of \\"memorable ads\\".TV ads riveted us\\", The Spectator, November 22, 1999 A subsequent commercial repeated the scenario with the same dialog, but used lumberjacks instead of children. Earlier, when Life cereal was first introduced in the 1960s, the original slogan was \\"The most useful protein ever in a ready-to-eat cereal\\". The original mascots (in commercials narrated by Paul Frees) were little munchkin-like characters.  Varieties  Life cereal with banana slices In 1978, Cinnamon Life which was developed by Ed Heaton was introduced, followed shortly thereafter by Raisin Life. Today, Cinnamon Life accounts for one third of total Life sales. Raisin Life sold poorly and was discontinued in the mid 1980s. In 2002, a short-lived version called Baked Apple Life was released. Honey Graham Life was introduced in early 2004, Life Vanilla Yogurt Crunch in late 2005, and another new flavor, Life Chocolate Oat Crunch, in 2006. All three were eventually discontinued in 2008. In 2008, Quaker introduced another new version, Maple & Brown Sugar Life. In the fall of 2016, Vanilla Life cereal was released, while Maple & Brown Sugar Life has become more scarce. In Canada and certain regions of the United States, there is also Multigrain Life. Newer varieties include Pumpkin Spice Life, Gingerbread Life, and Strawberry Life. Original Life has been reformulated several times since its introduction, sometimes unsuccessfully. Most recently, in 1997, Quaker introduced a \\"New and Improved\\" version; consumer response was unfavorable and Quaker quickly reverted to the earlier formula.  Nutrition and ingredients  If left in the milk too long, the cereal becomes soggy. In 2010, Life was featured on the Eat This, Not That website. It was categorized as a healthy cereal but was criticized for its content of the yellow food dye \\"Yellow 5\\", or tartrazine. The original cereal also contains disodium phosphate, the preservative BHT, yellow 6, and pyridoxine hydrochloride.

In May 2011, the American Ornithologists' Union voted to split the Mexican jay into two species, one retaining the common name Mexican jay and one called the Transvolcanic jay. The Mexican jay is a medium-sized jay with blue upper parts and pale gray underparts. It resembles the Woodhouse's scrub-jay, but has an unstreaked throat and breast. It feeds largely on acorns and pine nuts, but includes many other plant and animal foods in its diet. It has a cooperative breeding system where the parents are assisted by other birds to raise their young. This is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".  Taxonomy and systematics  A recent decision by the American Ornithologists' Union Check-list Committee elevated some populations of the Mexican jay to a separate species, called the Transvolcanic jay (A. ultramarina), based on diagnosable phenotypic differences in plumage and morphology, millions of years of genetic divergence and no evidence for interbreeding with Mexican jays. The Transvolcanic jay inhabits montane forest in the Transvolcanic Belt of central Mexico. Populations to the north retained the common name Mexican jay, but the Latin name changed to A. wollweberi. This was because the type specimen was a Transvolcanic jay, meaning that this species had precedent for the original Latin name A. ultramarina. Thus, as of this decision, there are now five described subspecies of the Mexican jay that are divided into three divergent groups (see below). Marked differences in size, color, vocalizations, and genetics have led some authors to consider at least two of these groups as separate species (Eastern and Western; Navarro-Sig√ºenza and Peterson 2004). The three groups inhabit three distinct mountainous regions in northern and central Mexico. Genetic breaks in mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA occur abruptly between the groups, indicating some barriers to genetic exchange (McCormack et al. 2008). Size variation among the groups does not always follow Bergmann's rule, with more southerly populations in the Sierra Madre Oriental being larger than populations to the north. Mexican jays do not seem to follow Gloger's rule either, as populations in arid habitat in southwestern Texas are very blue. On the other hand, Mexican jays in Arizona - also arid habitat - have a washed-out appearance, in accordance with Gloger's rule. Western group Sierra Madre Occidental in northern [Jalisco] north to central Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Southern and eastern limits in Jalisco deserve further study. Juveniles have a pink/pale base to the otherwise black bill for up to two years. Eggs are pale green-blue and unspeckled, unlike Eastern group where speckled eggs are common. *Aphelocoma wollweberi gracilis :Eastern Nayarit and northern Jalisco :Smallest of the Western subspecies with a distinct, high-pitched vocalization. *Aphelocoma wollweberi wollweberi :Durango and Zacatecas :Intermediate in size. *Aphelocoma wollweberi arizonae :Sonora and Chihuahua north to Arizona and New Mexico, United States :Largest and palest of all the subspecies. Eastern group Sierra Madre Oriental in Nuevo Le√≥n and western Tamaulipas north to Texas (Chisos Mountains). Juveniles have an all-black exterior to the bill after fledging, but roof of inner upper mandible can remain partially white for up to two years. Reports of less social behavior compared to other groups are over-stated and credible accounts of cooperative breeding (Ligon and Husar 1974) and large flock sizes (Bhagabati and Horvath 2006) exist. Plain, speckled, and even white eggs have been observed in a single study area (McCormack and Berg 2010). *Aphelocoma wollweberi couchii :Smaller than preceding. Population of the latter subspecies distinguishable by more contrasting markings and ecological preferences (lowland birds). Egg color may range from plain blue to Nile blue with pale brownish speckling, most heavy on blunt half. Gives rattle call similar to Cyanocitta and other Aphelocoma jays. Central Plateau group Central Plateau in Queretaro, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, and eastern Jalisco. Similar to Eastern group but larger in most features. Distinguishable in morphology and plumage in ~80% of specimens. There is an area of apparent hybridization in San Luis Potosi that deserves study. *Aphelocoma wollweberi potosina Description The Mexican jay is a medium-large (~120 g) passerine similar in size to most other jays, with a blue head, blue-gray mantle, blue wings and tail, and pale gray breast and underparts. The sexes are morphologically similar, and juveniles differ only in having less blue coloration and, in some populations, a pink/pale (instead of black) bill that progressively becomes more black with age (Brown and Horvath 1989). Some field guides misreport this color as yellow because the pale bill becomes yellow in museum study skins. The iris is brown and legs are black. It is most readily distinguished from the similar Woodhouse's scrub-jay by the plain (unstreaked) throat and breast, and the mantle contrasting less with the head and wings. Its range somewhat overlaps with the Woodhouse's scrub-jay, but, where they co-occur, the two species seem to show ecological and morphological character displacement (Curry et al. 2002). Distribution and habitat It is native to the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre Occidental, and Central Plateau of Mexico as well as eastern Arizona, western New Mexico and western Texas in the United States. Its preferred habitat is montane pine-oak forest. Ecology In the winter, the Mexican jay's diet consists mainly of acorns and pine nuts, which are stored in the autumn. However, they are omnivorous in all seasons and their diet includes a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including invertebrates, small amphibians and reptiles, and birds' eggs and nestlings (McCormack and Brown 2008). It has a cooperative breeding system similar to that of the related Florida scrub-jay, with several birds helping at a nest; these \\"helpers\\" are usually immature offspring of the dominant pair from the previous 1‚Äì2 years, but also include apparently unrelated flock members.

Ltd, a company based in Singapore. Once assembled they can be customized with stickers (packaged as Stikers) and different pieces from other sets. The design principle behind STIKFAS is that all of the joints are ball/socket, and offer poseability, interchangeability, and articulation. Stikfas are sold as \\"kits\\" that include accessories, Stikers, and sometimes additional models (dragon, dog, cat, bike, horse, octopus...) to accentuate the \\"theme\\" of each kit. Photo of a Stikfas toy Pirate and Ninja Stikfas company history The debut of STIKFAS was through a successful co-branding in 2001 with the computer game publisher Electronic Arts. This collaboration provided a proof of concept and Stikfas Pte. Ltd. was incorporated in August. Work began on the first mass production model of the STIKFAS Action Figure Kit, which was made available to public through online sales at www.stikfas.com in December 2001. From 2002 to 2004, STIKFAS was licensed to Hasbro Inc and this move saw an increase in its product range, distribution network as well as market recognition. During this period, STIKFAS was awarded the title of \\"Best Original Concept\\" in \\"Best of the Best 2002\\" by Wizard's Toyfare magazine, the industry's leading publication. That year, STIKFAS came in second for \\"Most Fun and Innovative Toy\\" in a consumer's poll by Toyshop Magazine. STIKFAS debuted in Japan in the fall of 2003 under the distribution of Tomy Direct Co., Ltd. In February 2005, the first comprehensive fan book about STIKFAS, its products and the people in the company, was published by Hobby Japan, the nation's leading hobby magazine since 1969. This publication reinforced the cult status that STIKFAS had in Japan. STIKFAS kits As of June 2006, different kits have been released, including Recolors (where only the colors of the parts have changed). Also, numerous different blisters, consisting of a single figure and no accessories, have been released. STIKFAS webcomics The poseability and customizability of STIKFAS action figures has attracted the attention of the online webcomic community. Several artists use out-of- the-box or customized STIKFAS as characters in continued webcomic adventures. The exceptional articulation enables nearly boundless expressions through body-language, while the blank slate faces provide unlimited facial options using Stikers, clay, paint, and/or digital tools. Within these webcomics, customizations to the blank STIKFAS include the addition of hair, facial features, and clothing. Clay, cloth, yarn, thread, and paper are the most common customizing materials. The comics also frequently include unique sets and props, often created by the artist or merely commandeered from other toy lines (Playmobil, Lego blocks, Megabloks, and so on). Stop motion animation Because of the \\"ultra pose-ability\\" of the Stikfas figures they have also been widely used to create independent stop motion animation films. Stop motion film examples: The Stikfas company hosts yearly stop motion contests at the Comic-Con Convention since 2007. Stikfas also have small square notches on their bodies which allow for rare earth magnets to be inserted. These notches can be found on the upper legs, feet and upper body section. The curved U shaped hands are also the same diameter as the notches. Once inserted into any of these areas, the magnets allow the Stikfas to be posed while adhered to a magnetic surface so they won't fall over. Stikfas glue Stikfas had been used as a product name before, completely unrelated to the current toy figures. Lee Kuan Yew helped to develop a glue based on tapioca, which he sold under the name Stikfas in Japanese-occupied Singapore during World War II. Lee Kuan Yew would later serve as the Prime Minister of Singapore for more than three decades.

V. O. Stamps was born in and raised in the Stamps Community in Upshur County, Texas, and was a key individual in early gospel music publishing. As a youth, he worked with his father in a sawmill, and used his earnings to purchase every gospel songbook he could find. In 1907 he attended the singing school of Richard M. Morgan. Sometime after that, his father bought a small store and V. O. worked there while teaching singing schools until 1914. In 1914 he became a field representative for the James D. Vaughan Music Company of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Stamps worked for the Tennessee Music Company, Samuel Beazley and J. D. Vaughan from 1914‚Äì24, including singing in a quartet representing the Vaughan company. Around 1915 he composed his first song, entitled \\"The Man Behind the Plow\\". In 1924 he founded the V. O. Stamps Music Company in Jacksonville, Texas. In that year the first session of the V. O. Stamps School of Music was held, with a faculty that included Thomas Benton, C. C. Stafford, R. B. Vaughan, and Otis Deaton. In 1924 or 1925 he published Harbor Bells - his first song book. In 1927, with J. R. Baxter, Stamps formed the Stamps-Baxter Music Company, based in Dallas, Texas. Stamps organized a gospel quartet in which he sang bass. He was a pioneer is the use of radio for promoting Southern gospel music and quartet singing. Radio station KRLD gave the quartet a daily show in 1936, after a large response from their radio performance at the Texas Centennial Exposition.

They are commonly operated by transportation departments, national and local parks departments and historic sites, airport authorities, local governments, federal agencies, colleges and universities, hospitals and health agencies, and for special events and destinations. TIS notification sign in the United States United States =Current regulations and applications= In the United States, most Travelers Information Stations (TIS) are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), although stations operated by U.S. national parks and others under U.S. federal government jurisdiction are licensed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Programming normally consists of continuously repeated pre-recorded messages. Permissible station content is defined by the FCC as: Most TIS/HAR licenses in the U.S are held by governmental entities, in addition to quasi-governmental agencies and authorities as well as health and emergency service providers working in conjunction with the government. Stations may be licensed to operate on any AM band frequency from 530‚Äì1700 kHz. (In a single case‚ÄîWQFG689, licensed to the County of Hudson, New Jersey‚Äîa station has been authorized to transmit on 1710 kHz.Universal Licensing System: WQFG689 (FCC.gov) 1710 kHz is also in use by a number of federally licensed stations.). A majority of TIS stations operate on 530 kHz, which is reserved exclusively for use by this service, and on the AM expanded band frequencies of 1610‚Äì1700 kHz, which is the least congested portion of the AM broadcast band. On 1610 kHz TIS service stations have a co-priority status with broadcasting stations,\\"Annex N: Special Considerations for Federal Travelers Information Stations Operating on 1610 kHz\\", Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management (NTIA.gov) while on the remaining standard AM broadcasting frequencies, 540 kHz-1600 kHz and 1620‚Äì1700 kHz, TIS stations are considered a secondary service, with priority held by standard broadcasting station assignments. Although initially envisioned as providing general information to motorists and travelers, TIS stations have also been developed for supporting emergency public safety communication, and the FCC currently licenses the stations through its Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB).\\"Low Power Radio - General Information: Travelers' Information Service\\" (FCC.gov) During a crisis mobile phone networks are often overloaded, and TIS stations can be used to broadcast emergency instructions. Also, during a widespread electrical outage stations equipped with reserve battery or generator power can continue operating, for reception by battery-operated radios. In 2008 the American Association of Information Radio Operators (AAIRO) was formed to represent station operators, and at the time of its formation the group emphasized the ability of TIS stations to broadcast live local updates to affected communities during emergencies.\\"The Power of Ten Watts to Protect Millions\\" by Bill Baker, IAEM (International Association of Emergency Managers) Bulletin, July 2008, page 16. Two forms of transmitting antennas are employed. Most commonly used are standard non-directional vertical antennas. However, an alternate implementation, called \\"leaky cable\\", is a form of carrier current transmission, which employs long horizontal conductors, commonly run alongside roadways. Stations using a standard antenna are generally limited to a coverage radius of , with an antenna height of no more than 15 meters (49.2 feet), and a maximum power of 10 watts, although critical evacuation systems, such as those in the Florida Keys and near chemical and nuclear facilities, have been granted waivers to exceed that limit for emergency operations, typically for up to 100 watts. Individual \\"leaky cable\\" installations are limited to a length of , although \\"ribbon systems\\" consisting of installations sequentially located along a travel route are permitted. Because cable installations are less effective radiators, they are permitted to use up to 50 watts order to achieve a maximum of 2 mV/m at from the cable. In order to limit potential interference to stations operating on adjacent frequencies, TIS transmitters are required to employ a low-pass filter to reduce the transmission of audio frequencies higher than 5 kHz. =TIS service history= The TIS service was first authorized by the FCC in 1977 following two years of study. At this time the standard AM broadcast band ran from 540 kHz to 1600 kHz, and the new TIS service was initially assigned exclusive use of the two adjoining frequencies of 530 kHz and 1610 kHz. However, on June 8, 1988 an International Telecommunication Union conference held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil adopted provisions, effective July 1, 1990, to extend the upper end of the AM broadcast band in the Americas, by adding ten frequencies which spanned from 1610 kHz to 1700 kHz.Final Acts of the Regional Radio Conference to Establish a Plan for the Broadcasting Service in the Band 1605-1705 in Region 2 (PDF) (Rio de Janeiro, 1988. ITU.int) 1980 QSL card confirming reception of TIS WXT613 located at the Cincinnati Airport By this time 1610 kHz had been assigned for use by hundreds of Travelers Information Stations in the United States. Moreover, the licensing authority was shared between the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), so coordination between these two agencies was required. It was concluded that, for operation on 1610 kHz, TIS and broadcasting stations were considered \\"co-primary\\" services, thus existing TIS stations were protected from having to move to new frequencies.\\"Travelers Information Stations\\" (paragraph 24), Memorandum Opinion and Order, Docket No. 87-267, FCC 93-196, filed May 11, 1993, effective date June 11, 1993. (This has effectively made it impossible to assign any standard broadcasting stations to 1610 kHz in the United States.) It was also informally suggested that, once most radios could tune to the higher frequencies, all of the TIS stations on 1610 kHz could be moved as a group to 1710 kHz, however this was never implemented. On July 18, 2013, in response to petitions submitted from Highway Information Systems, Inc. (HIS), the American Association of Information Radio Operators (AAIRO), and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the FCC adopted Report and Order 13-98 updating and clarifying the regulations applying to TIS stations. The Report and Order, as summarized by a May 2014 Compliance Guide (DA-14-651), approved the establishment of \\"ribbons\\" of sequentially located roadside transmitters so long as content remained pertinent at all points. This also clarified that programming content must relate to travel, emergencies or situations of imminent danger to the public, and that it is at the discretion of station operators, based on their knowledge of the area and its population, of what situations present an imminent danger.\\"Report and Order 13-98\\", Adopted: July 18, 2013, Released July 23, 2013 (FCC.gov) A subsequent Rule Making procedure, instituted at the request of the AAIRO, resulted in the loosening of the audio frequency limit from 3 kHz to 5 kHz, after it was determined that the improved frequency response would increase intelligibility without increasing interference to stations operating on adjacent frequencies. Although the original proposal suggested completely eliminating the filtering, the 5 kHz standard was adopted as a compromise after the National Association of Broadcasters noted that \\"full-power AM radio stations routinely use 5 kHz filters to address and prevent interference among AM stations, with few significant problems\\".\\"FCC 15-37: Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and Order\\", Adopted: March 25, 2015, Released: March 26, 2015 (FCC.gov) =Low-power FM stations= In 2000 the FCC began authorizing non-commercial Low Power FM (LPFM) stations, which are not formally a part of the TIS/HAR service, although in a few cases stations have been adapted to serve a similar function. LPFM stations operate with up to 100 watts and generally have somewhat larger service areas than TIS stations on the AM band, and also avoid the increased nighttime interference from distant stations which affects AM band stations. However, in contrast to the TIS service, there are only limited \\"filing window\\" periods to apply for permission to build an LPFM station, and these stations are required to produce up to 8 hours of new programming each day, and also in certain instances to share airtime with other licensees. LPFM examples include WTUS-LP in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, originally operated by the Tuscaloosa Tourism and Sports Commission before being transferred in 2016 to the Tuscaloosa City Board of Education, and WGEO-LP in Georgetown, South Carolina, which is operated by the Georgetown City Fire Department. State and local governments may also create state-wide networks to provide non-commercial public safety information via radio using LPFM stations. Colorado has a statewide network of LPFMs used in this manner, while many other state, county, or local governments use one or more stations. Europe The old European road sign about radio traffic-information frequency for radio station Gornji Milanovac (Serbia). In France information is provided at 107.7 MHz FM along selected autoroutes. In Italy most highways are covered by RAI's Isoradio network, broadcasting in most areas on 103.3 MHz. In Germany and the former Yugoslavia, highways and motorways are provided with traffic information by radio, although the original systems have been largely replaced. Newer RDS-based systems interrupt a station's regular programming to give travelers current information about the highway, updated traffic and weather reports, public service announcements by various governmental and public organizations, railway information and news bulletins. These radio systems are most commonly used in Slovenia, Croatia and partly in Serbia. Highways served with traffic radio information include: * European route E61: Villach‚ÄìKranj‚ÄìLjubljana * European route E70: Ljubljana‚ÄìZagreb‚ÄìSisak‚ÄìSlavonski Brod‚ÄìBelgrade. Japan In Japan Highway Radio broadcasts on 1620 and 1629 kHz AM along stretches of major expressways. Canada TIS stations operate in Canada (on both AM and FM bands).

Sometimes a distinction is made between a portable player, battery-powered and with one or more small loudspeakers, and a personal player, listened to with earphones. History Portable battery- operated reel-to-reel tape recorders were introduced in the 1950s, initially tending to be high-priced units for reporters, produced by Uher and Nagra. Lower-priced units became available later. In the mid-1960s Philips introduced the battery-operated compact cassette recorder, originally used for recording speech. At about the same time the 8-track player was introduced. It was very successful at the time, though bulky and inconvenient to use. There was a pause at the end of each track as the program changed. The compact cassette, although physically much smaller than the 8-track cartridge, became capable of good sound quality as the technology developed, and longer cassette tapes became available. Cassette decks (not portable) were introduced for home use, and this encouraged the production of pre-recorded music cassettes. Personal stereo Panasonic Stereo Cassette Player RQ-JA63 The first truly personal cassette player, the Sony Walkman, was introduced in 1979 and sold very well. It was much smaller than an 8-track player or the earlier cassette recorders, and was listened to with stereophonic headphones, unlike previous equipment which used small loudspeakers. Unlike small loudspeakers, headphones were capable of very good sound quality. All previous compact cassette devices could record as well as play back; Walkmans and similar devices often had no recording facility, but took advantage of the pre-recorded cassettes that had become widely available. Disk players Early personal CD players can play commercial CDs; later models can play recordable CD-R and CDRW media either copied from a pressed CD or containing MP3 and similar files. Media players In 1998, digital audio players (DAPs) based on flash memory or hard disk storage became available (The Rio PMP300 from Diamond Multimedia is widely considered to be the first mass market DAP). Files are usually compressed using lossy compression; this reduces file size at the cost of some loss of quality. The trade-off between degree of compression and file size can be varied, although this is not an option for existing compressed files. The advantage of solid-state DAPs over hard disks and CDs is resistance to vibration, small size and weight, and low battery usage.

Santos (April 19, 1938 ‚Äì April 19, 2018) was an American radio play-by-play announcer for the New England Patriots of the National Football League, and morning sports reporter for WBZ radio in Boston. He was an inductee of the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame. He retired from WBZ radio in January 2009, and was inducted into the WBZ Radio Hall of Fame on July 9, 2009. The Patriots 2012 season was his final season of radio play-by- play. Early years Santos was born in Acushnet, Massachusetts, and grew up in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. He graduated from Fairhaven High School in 1956. He attended the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and later graduated from the New England Broadcast School. From 1959 through 1971, Santos worked on radio at WBSM and WNBH in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and WSAR and WALE in Fall River, Massachusetts. Career Santos first began his work on Patriots games as the color commentator working with play-by-play announcer Bob Starr from 1966 through 1970 on WBZ 1030. After Starr's departure from the Boston market following the 1970 NFL season, Santos took over as play-by-play announcer and handled that assignment for nine years. From 1980 through 1990, the Patriots' broadcast rights shifted‚Äîfirst to WEEI 590, then to WHDH 850‚Äîand Santos spent 11 seasons out of the team's radio booth, with John Carlson, Curt Gowdy and Dale Arnold serving as play-by-play announcers for those flagship stations. Santos returned as the Patriots' radio voice in 1991 when WBZ radio regained the team's broadcast rights. From 1972 through 1978 and from 1990 through 2011, his partner in the booth was former Patriots kicker Gino Cappelletti, except for the opening eight games of the 2001 Patriots season when Cappelletti was hospitalized with an illness and former Patriots player Peter Brock substituted for Cappelletti. Cappelletti retired from his position prior to the 2012 season and was replaced by former Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak. In addition to his work at WBZ, Santos commentated games for the Boston Celtics, Boston Breakers, Providence Friars basketball, Penn State Nittany Lions football, and Boston College Eagles football. On January 10, 2009, Santos announced his retirement from WBZ radio, effective at the end of that month. He continued as Patriots play-by-play announcer when the team's network switched from WBCN to the new WBZ-FM, branded as \\"The Sports Hub\\". In April 2012, Santos suffered a bout with pneumonia and was briefly hospitalized, calling into question his future as Patriots play-by-play announcer. He nonetheless announced he would return for one final season as Patriots broadcaster, retiring after the 2012 NFL season. In April 2013, Bob Socci was announced as Santos' replacement. Santos' 36 years of service made him the longest-serving announcer in the NFL, tied with Merrill Reese of the Philadelphia Eagles; he was also the final announcer who remained from the American Football League era. =Milestones= On September 26, 2010, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 38‚Äì30; it marked the 700th Patriots game, encompassing preseason, regular season, playoffs, and the Super Bowl, that Santos broadcast. His 750th broadcast took place on November 11, 2012, a dramatic 37‚Äì31 Patriots win, also against the Bills. He commentated 15 of the club's 19 playoff runs and six Super Bowls. On December 30, 2012, Santos was rejoined by Gino Cappelletti for the first quarter of New England's 28‚Äì0 shutout of the Dolphins, his final regular season broadcast. CBS Sports also simulcast part of Santos' play-by-play during the game's first quarter. Prior to the game, during a ceremony honoring the contributions of Santos and Cappelletti, Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft announced that Santos would be inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2013. The last game Santos commentated was in January 2013, the Patriots' AFC Championship Game loss to the Ravens, his 759th broadcast. Santos was inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame on July 22, 2013, alongside fellow honoree Tedy Bruschi. Personal life Santos served in the Massachusetts Army National Guard with the 1st Howitzer Battalion, 211 Field Artillery, and attained the rank of staff sergeant.Legacy.com. \\"Gilbert A.

He served as Acting Governor of New Jersey for 90 minutes on January 8, 2002, by virtue of his status as New Jersey Attorney General.  Early life and career  Farmer was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1957. He attended Georgetown University receiving a B.A. degree in 1979 and a J.D. degree in 1986. After law school he worked as a clerk for New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Alan B. Handler. From 1988 to 1990, he was an associate in the law firm of Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti in Morristown. From 1990 to 1994 he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.  Whitman administration  In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman appointed Farmer as Chief Counsel, after having served as Deputy Chief Counsel and Assistant Counsel to the Governor.Official bio, Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey. Accessed April 26, 2008. Farmer was nominated to be New Jersey Attorney General on March 15, 1999, and was sworn in the following June after being confirmed unanimously by the New Jersey Senate. He continued to serve under Donald DiFrancesco after Whitman's resignation.  Acting Governor  Farmer served as Acting Governor for 90 minutes on January 8, 2002. Following Governor Christine Todd Whitman's resignation the previous year to become head of the EPA, Farmer was one of four people to serve as acting governor for the one-year period between Whitman's resignation and Jim McGreevey's inauguration, along with three different senate presidents (Donald DiFrancesco, John O. Bennett, and Richard Codey). DiFrancesco served as acting governor for all but the last week of this period, when his term as senate president ended with the mandate of the outgoing senate on January 8, 2002, while newly elected governor Jim McGreevy would not be inaugurated before January 15, 2002. The state did not have the position of lieutenant governor until 2010, and succession rules specified that the next in line for governor after the Senate President and the Speaker of the Assembly, which both became vacant on January 8, would be the Attorney General until the next Senate President could be sworn in. This automatically made Farmer Acting Governor. Republican Bennett and Democrat Codey became Co-Presidents of the Senate on the same day, because the Senate had been evenly split between the two parties, and then divided the last week of the term among them as Governor, with Bennett serving from January 8, 2002 to January 12, 2002; and Codey serving from January 12, 2002, to January 15, 2002. As a result, the state had five different people serving as governor during a period of eight days (DiFrancesco, Farmer, Bennett, Codey, and McGreevey).Staff. \\"N.J.'S LINE OF SUCCESSION / A SIMPLE FIX\\", The Press of Atlantic City, November 11, 2002. accessed June 22, 2012. \\"Thanks to an unusual set of circumstances and a flaw in the state constitution, New Jersey had five different governors over eight days at the beginning of the year. Even for New Jersey, this was pretty bizarre.\\"  Later career  Farmer subsequently acted as Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (officially known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States) chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean and former Indiana Congressman Lee H. Hamilton. Most recently, Farmer has served as Dean of Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark. In his tenure, Farmer, in conjunction with the Rutgers Law Review, planned a multi-day symposium to address the many legal uncertainties in post-9/11 national security policy and practices. The symposium featured Thomas Kean, Michael Chertoff, and Judge John Joseph Gibbons, among other scholars and national security leaders. He has also welcomed two United States Supreme Court Justices-- Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito‚Äîto the Law School for exclusive speaking engagements. Prior to his deanship, Farmer practiced law as a partner in a North Jersey firm he founded, and was an adjunct professor of law at the Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark. He also regularly contributes to The Star-Ledger and appears in The New York Times, among other publications. Farmer's book, The Ground Truth: The Untold Story of America Under Attack On 9/11, was released days before the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In \\"The Ground Truth,\\" Farmer made the following controversial statement: \\"At some level of government,\\" says Dean Farmer, \\"at some point in time, a decision was made not to tell the truth about the national response to the attacks on the morning of 9/11. We owe the truth to the families of the victims of 9/11. We owe it to the American public as well, because only by understanding what has gone wrong in the past can we assure our nation's safety in the future.\\" On January 21, 2010, he appeared on The Colbert Report.

Rush'n Attack is remembered for its Cold War setting (the title is a play on \\"Russian attack\\") and its reliance on the player using a knife to dispatch enemies. Gameplay The player takes on the role of a United States special operations soldier infiltrating an enemy military base in order to save multiple POWs from being executed by firing squad. There are four stages: a Marshalling Area, a Harbor, an Air Base and a Siberian Camp. The omnipresent knife can be supplemented with captured arms. By killing certain enemy soldiers, the player can obtain a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. At the end of each stage, the player will face a unique group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs, Stage 3 with three shooting autogyros and Stage 4 with a skillful multi-shot flamethrower operator. When the mission is accomplished the four rescued POWs salute and the player repeats the game from the first stage on the next difficulty level. While the player can remain still in one area and rack up points, if he takes too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There's also an invisible time limit that will kill off the player if he takes too long to complete the stage. Extra lives are given at 30,000 & 70,000, and per 70,000 up to 980,000, and \\"survival of the fittest\\" mode thereafter. The in-game music is a looping drum cadence. Home versions =Home computers= Front cover of the ZX Spectrum version of Green Beret, artwork by Bob Wakelin. Under license from Konami, Imagine Software released home versions of the game under the Green Beret title for various home computer formats in Europe in 1986. Versions were released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, the MSX, and the BBC Micro. The Commodore 64 version was well known for its loading music by Martin Galway. In 1987, the game was included on the compilation Konami Coin-op Hits with Hyper Sports, Mikie and Yie Ar Kung- Fu.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue065/Pages/CVG06500065.jpg An unrelated IBM PC port was released by Konami for the North American market under the Rush'n Attack name in 1989. =NES/Famicom= A Family Computer Disk System version of Green Beret was released in Japan on April 10, 1987, along with a corresponding version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (under the Rush'n Attack name) released during the same month in North America and Europe. The player's objective in the NES version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy's headquarters. Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The NES version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit. The Famicom version features a few differences from its NES counterpart by allowing the player to continue up to three times after a game over and if the player loses a life in the Famicom version, his character will respawn at the very spot where he died instead of being sent to the last checkpoint (in the NES version, instant respawns are only allowed in the 2-Players game). Moreover, the player can carry up to nine rounds of any secondary weapon he finds instead of just three. To rebalance the difficulty, the NES version gives the player more extra lives when they begin (four instead of two) and all weapons dropped by enemies will always have three rounds in them instead of having the player accumulate them one by one. The Famicom version also features hidden underground areas which the player could access by destroying certain land mines in Stage 2, 4, and 5. =Game Boy Advance= An arranged port of the arcade version of Rush'n Attack is included in the 2002 compilation Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced for the Game Boy Advance. The game features the same stages as in the arcade version, as well as two extra stages accessible via the Konami Code that are based on the added stages from the NES version. A two-players versus mode is added which utilizes the Game Link Cable. The controls have been changed so that the player presses the A button to jump instead of Up on the d-pad. =Nintendo DS= A second portable is included in the 2007 compilation Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the Nintendo DS. Unlike the GBA version, the DS version is a direct port of the original arcade game. However, it includes various bonus features such scans of the instruction cards and leaflet, as well as tips. =Xbox 360= Rush'n Attack was released as an Xbox Live Arcade title for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2007. This version is another direct port of the arcade game, but features an optional game mode with improved graphics and a remixed soundtrack. This version was developed by Digital Eclipse. =Konami Net DX= Green Beret was released as an i-appli for Mobile phones in Japan in 2006. The mobile version is a direct port of the Famicom version with a new feature: the health bar. The mobile port was re-released in China for normal Java mobile phones on December 26, 2008. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Rush'n Attack on their November 15, 1985 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Rush'n Attack/Green Beret was well received. The MS- DOS version of Rush'n Attack was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #142 by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. The NES version ranked 99 on IGN's top 100 NES games list.

The excess may be collected for reuse. Subirrigation is used in growing field crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and sugar cane in areas with high water tables such as Florida and in commercial greenhouse operations. Three basic types of subirrigation system are in general use for potted plants in greenhouses: ebb-and-flow (bench- mounted enclosures holding pots are filled and then drained); trough (water is flowed through bench-mounted, slightly sloping enclosures containing pots); and flooded floor (special sloped concrete flooring is flooded and drained). Greenhouse subirrigation has been growing in popularity since the 1990s. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving. The outfitting cost is relatively high. Potential problems, such as the possibility of increased presence of disease in recycle water, have only begun to be investigated. One of the disadvantages of sub-irrigated closed systems, such like Earth Boxes and sub-irrigated planters, is that soluble salts cannot be flushed into the lower soil profile and build up over time.

Customers of the CSBF include NASA centers, universities, and scientific groups from all over the world. Mission CSBF has a threefold mission: * Provide maintenance, operations and logistics support for NASA's scientific balloon program and facilities. * Provide sophisticated ground and flight systems for launch, control, data retrieval, commanding, and recovery of NASA's balloon missions. * Perform research and development to advance the capabilities of NASA's suborbital programs. History The Balloon Facility was established by Vincent E. Lally at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado in 1961 under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. It was moved to Palestine, Texas in 1963 and designated as the National Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF) in January 1973. In 1982, sponsorship of the NSBF was transferred from the National Science Foundation to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the NSBF became a separate entity under the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). From October 1987 to January 2015, the CSBF was operated by the Physical Science Laboratory under the auspices of New Mexico State University located in Las Cruces, New Mexico. In February 2015, operation of the facility was transferred to the Technical Services Division of Orbital ATK. It is administered by Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility Balloon Program Office. Its Texas location put the NSBF in the middle of the area where the debris from the Space Shuttle Columbia dropped to Earth on February 1, 2003. In February 2006, the NSBF was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in honor of the Crew of STS-107. CSBF Ballooning =Balloon= Flight profile of Super-Pressure Balloons versus Zero-Pressure Balloons. CSBF conventional and long duration (LDB) balloons are made of 20 micrometer thick polyethylene film, and at float have a diameter of up to 140 meters (460 ft) and a volume of up to 1.12 million cubic meters (39.57 million cubic ft). The balloons are filled with helium gas, can carry payloads up to 3600 kilograms (7,936 lb), fly at altitudes of up to 42 kilometers (26 mi), and can remain at float in excess of 40 days. The balloons are zero pressure difference balloons, and are vented at the bottom. They are only partially inflated when launched, and as they rise up, the lower atmospheric pressure causes them to fully inflate. The bottom of the balloon is attached to a parachute, which is then attached by steel suspension cables to the payload. A flight is terminated by firing an explosive squib which separates the parachute from the balloon. A rip line simultaneously tears open the top of the balloon. The balloon quickly deflates and falls to the ground, to be retrieved and disposed of (balloons are single use). The payload descends, suspended by the parachute, and is recovered by the ground crew. Conventional payloads typically have a float duration at altitude of 72+ hours. Long Duration Ballooning payloads float at durations of 42+ days. Ultra long duration balloons (ULDB) are being developed which can operate at float for +100 days. The limiting factor is the diurnal cycle of the sun, rising and setting. Heat during the day causes the balloon to expand and gain altitude, thereby losing helium . Heat loss at night causes the balloon to sink and contract. Ballast is carried to overcome the effect. Flying in a polar region during full sunlight allows more negligible altitude variations. ULDB balloons or superpressure balloons (SPB) are sealed to prevent helium loss and have a pumpkin shape at flight altitude. The SPB TRAVALB-2 surpassed previous Antarctic balloon flights by staying aloft for 149 Days, 3 hours, and 58 minutes after launch from the NASA Long Duration Balloon (LDB) site at LDB Camp, McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The operation was supported by National Science Foundation and United States Antarctic Program. After the Travalb-1 launch abort, the Travalb-2 lifted off on 29 December 2019 to test NASA balloon trajectory predictions in Antarctica and to study electron loses from Earth's radiation belts. =Preparation, Launch, and Flight= A balloon flight involves both the CSBF and a scientific team(s). The CSBF determines the launch site based on scientific goals, and provides local preparation facilities, a balloon(s), launch and recovery vehicles, and personnel to support the logistical aspects of pre flight, flight, and post flight activities. Scientific teams ship a payload to the launch site, and set up a small field station to assemble their equipment, make last-minute preparations, and manage the experiment during flight. The payload is typically a large instrument or cluster of instruments, plus onboard computers, radio telemetry equipment, and ballast. Launching a balloon requires the conjunction of light low-level winds (to comply with the limitations of the CSBF dynamic launch technique) and suitable upper-level winds (so the balloon remains within telemetry range of a ground station, and within the permitted flight region). The payload may be rolled out to the launch area several times before surface and upper atmosphere conditions are acceptable for launch. During the flight, data is transmitted to the ground for quick-look analysis, and is usually recorded on board as well. Scientists on the ground usually actively control the payload. An astronomical telescope, for example, can be real time directed toward a variety of sources for observations, or left in an autonomous mode of operation. =Launch Sites= CSBF launches balloons from several sites in the world, depending on the needs of the experiment they carry. Sites include: *Palestine, Texas *Fort Sumner, New Mexico *McMurdo Station, Antarctica *Alice Springs, Australia *Esrange, Sweden *Fairbanks, Alaska *Lynn Lake, Manitoba *Wanaka, New Zealand Backup Control Center Since 2017, CSBF has been designated as the Backup Control Center (BCC) for the International Space Station's Mission Control Center (MCC) in Houston, TX. Approximately 3 hours from Houston, CSBF provides facilities that NASA can utilize for short-term control of the ISS in case MCC is evacuated. The BCC was temporarily activated in August 2020 while the Johnson Space Center prepared for Hurricane Laura.

From 1954 until 1960, they belonged in the Class AAA International League, affiliated with Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds. Their home stadium was El Gran Estadio del Cerro (sometimes called Gran Stadium) in Havana. History The Sugar Kings began life in 1946 as the Havana Cubans, founded by Washington Senators scout Joe Cambria. They played in the old Class C (later Class B) Florida International League. The 1947 Cubans were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. In 1954, Roberto \\"Bobby\\" Maduro bought the team, moved it to the International League, and renamed it the Sugar Kings. Several talented Cuban players and other Latinos who eventually made it to the Major Leagues donned the Sugar Kings uniform, including Luis Arroyo, Pompeyo Davalillo, Tony Gonz√°lez, Cookie Rojas, Elio Chac√≥n, Danny Morej√≥n, Preston G√≥mez, Leo C√°rdenas, and Mike Cuellar. =Exhibition with Fidel Castro and Los Barbudos= Fidel Castro and Camilo Cienfuegos in Barbudos uniforms Fidel Castro was a long-time baseball fan and often attended Sugar Kings games at Gran Stadium. In fact, Castro had been a pitcher during his days at the University of Havana. Soon after taking power, he pledged to underwrite the Sugar Kings' debts. In an exhibition contest between his own pickup squad Los Barbudos (\\"The Bearded Ones\\") and a military police team prior to a game between the Sugar Kings and the Rochester Red Wings on July 24, 1959, Castro pitched two innings. He ended up with two strikeouts. The following day, another game between the Red Wings and Sugar Kings began late and continued into the night. Castro's supporters were in full force in the stands, and when midnight struck, they erupted into a torrent of lights, music, flag-waving, and even gunfire in a raucous celebration of the anniversary of the 26th of July Movement. The random gunfire continued, and Rochester third base coach Frank Verdi and Havana shortstop Leo C√°rdenas ended up with flesh wounds. The Red Wings' manager, Cot Deal, fearing for his team's safety, decided to pull Rochester from the game, and League officials cancelled the rest of the Sugar Kings' homestand. =1959 championship= Undeterred, the Sugar Kings ‚Äî led by future major league manager Preston G√≥mez ‚Äî eventually finished third in the IL standings, but upset Columbus and Richmond to win the League championship. They then ended up winning the 1959 Junior World Series in seven games over the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. =Nationalization and departure from Cuba= However, in 1960, Castro nationalized all U.S.-owned enterprises in Cuba, and on July 8, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick (under pressure from Secretary of State Christian Herter) announced that the Sugar Kings would move to Jersey City, New Jersey, and became the Jersey City Jerseys. They lasted only through the 1961 season, then folded due to poor attendance. The franchise was then sold to a Florida group from Jacksonville and became the Jacksonville Suns, who began play in the International League in 1962. That franchise moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1969 and became the Tidewater Tides, and remains in that region as the Norfolk Tides. In February 1987, the Miami City Commission voted unanimously in favor of the renaming Miami Stadium in honor of Bobby Maduro, who had migrated to USA.

It is a Grade I listed building, positioned above the surrounding countryside, and commands excellent views. It is said that the house was the model for House Beautiful in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). It is today the property of English Heritage, and is open to free public access during daylight hours. Descent =Herbert= The estate of Houghton was granted by King James I of England (1603-1625) to Mary Herbert, Dowager Countess of Pembroke (1561-1621), a.k.a. Mary Sidney, a courtier, writer, translator, and literary patron, who commenced the building of the existing house in about 1615. Two architects were very likely responsible for the design, John Thorpe, who worked in the Jacobean tradition, and Inigo Jones, who introduced the Classical style of architecture into England.http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/houghton- house/history/ The Countess of Pembroke was visited there by King James I in 1621, soon after its completion. Shortly afterwards, on 25 September 1621, she died of the smallpox. The surviving Jacobean-style frieze on the western side of the house displays heraldic elements relating to the Sidney family and to the Countess's relations, the Dudley family. =Bruce= Two years after the death of the Countess of Pembroke, the house reverted to King James I by the Countess' brother, the King then granted the estate to Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin (1599‚Äì1663) in 1624, which became the main residence of the Bruce family for three generations. King Charles I of England later granted him nearby Houghton Park to preserve game for the royal hunt, but persistent hunting and hawking by the local Conquest family forced the King's subsequent intervention. In the churchyard of nearby Maulden Church, the advowson of which was owned by the Bruce family,http://www.stmarysmaulden.org/churchhistory.htm is the Ailesbury Mausoleum, the earliest free-standing mausoleum in England,Colvin, Howard, Architecture and the After-Life, 1991, pp.312-3, quoted in built in 1656 by Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin in memory of his 2nd wife, Lady Diana Cecil.http://www.stmarysmaulden.org/mausoleum.htm The Bruce family resided in the house until Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury went into exile on the Continent in 1696 on account of his loyalty to the deposed King James II of England (1685-deposed 1688, died 1701). =Russell= Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury never returned to Houghton and in 1738 sold the house to John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, whose principal seat was Woburn Abbey, about seven miles from Houghton. His son and heir apparent, Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (d.1767), lived at Houghton from 1764 until he died in a hunting accident in 1767. Thus the 4th Duke's estates, including Houghton, and titles passed to his grandson, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford (d.1802), who having let the deerpark to a neighbour found he was unable to let the house without its grounds. Considering the house as a liability, in 1794 he ordered Houghton to be dismantled, and accordingly the furnishings were stripped out and the roof removed to be sold as building materials. The staircase survives in The Swan Hotel in Bedford. The 5th Duke never married and thus did not produce a legitimate male heir. He died in 1802 by which time the house, by then long open to the elements, was already in decay. =21st century= The ruins were acquired by English Heritage, and is open to free public access during daylight hours. Conservation work was undertaken in 2006 to help maintain safety and improve the understanding of the site and new visitor information boards were installed.

Biography Samuel Belzberg was born to a Jewish family in Calgary, AlbertaCanadian Encyclopedia: \\"Samuel Belzberg\\" retrieved April 1, 2014 and educated at the University of Alberta. In 1962, he founded the provincial trust company, City Savings and Trust in Edmonton which was heavily involved in real-estate development financing. In 1968, he moved to Vancouver with his brothers, Hyman Belzberg (1925-2017) and William Belzberg (1932-2014), and formed Western Realty. In 1970, he founded First City Financial Corp as the parent company for City Savings and Trust. In 1973, Belzberg and his brothers sold Western Realty and purchased Far West Financial Corp of California, marking their entrance into the United States. By the late 1980s, First City Financial Corp, now a diversified holding company, had assets of $5.4 billion with operations in Canada and the US. First City was involved in many large investment transactions including Bache Securities before it was sold to Prudential, Gulf Oil, Armstrong World (a large building supply company) and Scovill (a manufacturing company which included Yale Locks, Hamilton Beach, NuTone) which they purchased in 1985 for $523 million. During the 1990s, Belzberg founded Balfour Holdings Ltd., a real estate company which, at its peak, operated over 26 projects spreading through the United States. Balfour's mandate was to profit from the dislocations in value in the United States due to the Savings and Loan crisis. Balfour subdivided and serviced its purchased lands and sold the lots to National Builders. In 1997, Balfour was sold to The Blackstone Group, a large U.S. private equity group and generated realized returns in excess of 20% per annum. During the 1990s, Mr. Belzberg was an active acquirer of distressed property in Alberta where values had dramatically declined due to the softness in the oil industry. These properties were subsequently divested when the market recovered. In 1992, Belzberg started a private real estate and equity investments company, which is now called Gibralt Capital Corporation. Philanthropy and awards Belzberg served on various Board of Directors and is involved with numerous charities. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1989 from the Governor General, and also in 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University. In 1992, he received the Governor General of Canada Award. In 2002, Mr. Belzberg was promoted to Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1977, with a donation of $500,000, he helped fund the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. He is the founder of both the Canadian and American Dystonia Medical Research Foundations.In 1988 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 2001. In 2009, he was made a member of the Order of British Columbia. The \\"Samuel and Frances Belzberg Library\\" at Simon Fraser University is named after the couple. Personal life Belzberg died on March 30, 2018, in Vancouver, and is survived by his wife of 68 years, Frances, and four children: Marc, Lisa, Wendy, and Sherry.

Groland (full name: Presipality of Groland, French : Pr√©sipaut√© du Groland) is a fictional country featured in various humorous programs on French television channel Canal+. It is a vague parody of France and of European microstates. The show associated with the country is Made in Groland, Also known, for the older version as : Groland Sat, 7 Jours au Groland (7 Days in Groland) Bienvenue au Groland. (Welcome to Groland) Groland Magazine, Groland.con. Description The landlocked nation is described as a 'presipality' (a neologism made from \\"principality\\" and \\"president\\"), and its main regions are: Upper Groland (le Groland-du-Haut), Side Groland (le Groland-de-C√¥t√©), Lower Groland (le Groland-du-bas), and Other Side Groland (Groland-de-l'Autre-C√¥t√©). The capital is Groville, the main river is the Gro, and the main prefectures are Grugny, Mufflins, Maroufle and Vichumes. The placenames, certain elements of Grolandais speech (e.g. the use of \\"ch'\\" instead of \\"le\\" or \\"la\\"), and the generally crass and unintelligent character of the Grolandais themselves, reflect popular stereotypes about rural northern France. Groland has the distinction of having a border with every country in the world. The motto of the country is Joie, hospitalit√©, l√¢chet√© (\\"Joy, hospitality, cowardice\\"). The country remained neutral during World War I, and was famous for being a haven for soldiers on leave, with its cheap alcohol and prostitutes. During World War II, the country's leadership collaborated with the Nazi occupier; the government engaged in policies of persecution and deportation of Jews and homosexuals. After American troops liberated the country, a sudden change of mood happened, and alleged former collaborators were murdered.  History of the program  Groland had been the star and permanent character of a continuous news television channel, CANAL International (pronounced CNL), a clear parody of CNN, until the style of the programme was renewed and updated. After CNL, the tone has slightly evolved towards a parody of a famous programme once called Aujourd'hui Madame (Madame Today), the soundtrack of which used to be a landmark of the two-channel, state-owned French TV of the late seventies. After September 2008 a new visual line put the emphasis on a collection of not-so-clean old people dancing around in home-mixed music selected by Sylvain Fus√©e, the historical pillar-director of the programme. This visual evolution reflects a more profound comeback of the programme to its original inspiration: depicting Groland as a character who by the voice of its various and colourful citizens embodies the hidden face of the French society. This repositioning left the systematic criticism of the then-current Sarkozy Administration to the other parody programme of Canal Plus, Les Guignols de l'info (The Info Clowns, or The Info Puppets). As per the words of the founders of Groland, Jules-√âdouard Moustic and Sylvain Fus√©e, the programme takes its roots in two sarcastic magazines, Fluide Glacial (Icy Fluid) and Charlie Hebdo (Charlie Weekly), that formed the background of their typical post-'68, neo-leftist culture. This form of black humour that prohibits puns is the essence and the main differenciator of this programme which has no equivalent on French television. A deeper scrutiny of the situations and narrative style of Groland's main host, Jules-Edouard Moustic, would reveal a clear Rabelais influence in Groland. The special reports convey a permanent allegory of alcohol and food as well as an omnipresence of all aspects of both digestive and reproductive functions. The images, visual line (by J√©r√¥me Letu√©) and soundtrack are carefully crafted to depict the Groland characters as driven by greed and luxury.

In 1963, the small chain was purchased by Richard O. Kearns, operated as Red Barn System, with the offices moving briefly to Dayton, Ohio and in August 1964 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the late 1960s United Servomation, also called Servomation, bought the Red Barn chain. In 1978 United Servomation merged with the City Investing Company's GDV division which also owned the Motel 6 motel chain. Only interested in real estate, construction, and financial services the new owners ceased advertising for the chain along with allowing the franchise leases to expire with the last of the leases expiring around 1988. At its peak, Red Barn had 300‚Äì400 restaurants in 19 states, as well as outlets in southern Ontario, elsewhere in Canada, and Australia. Following the shutdown of operations, most of the Red Barn buildings were converted for other uses. A few of the chain restaurants were renamed \\"The Farm\\" in various states and continued serving the same menu items available when they were under their Red Barn franchise. There were two locations under \\"The Farm\\" name in Racine, Wisconsin and Bradford, Pennsylvania that served the same menu items. The Bradford location closed for a brief period in 2014 from a small fire and permanently closed in December 2015. The Racine, Wisconsin store closed on February 2, 2020. The Australian Red Barn stores were sold and converted into McDonald's locations. History =Building design= A former Red Barn location at 1725 Dundas St East in Mississauga, Ontario, is now a Mr. Sub restaurant. Originally, the Red Barn restaurants were in the shape of barns with a glass front and limited seating. The design of the building was patented in 1962 by Red Barn Systems, Incorporated of Springfield, Ohio, which granted the franchise licenses. Later buildings had the familiar fast-food style mansard roof which allowed them to comply to more local building codes. =Menu items= Hamburger Hungry They were known for \\"Big Barney\\" (a hamburger similar to a Big Mac) and the \\"Barnbuster\\" (similar to a Quarter Pounder or Whopper.) The chain was quite forward-looking with their food choices: the Big Barney predated the Big Mac by a few years, and it was the first chain to have self-service salad bars. =Advertising and promotions= Chicken Hungry Big Fish Hungry The restaurant chain had a TV commercial jingle whose lyrics were: \\"When the hungries hit / When the hungries hit / Hit the Red Barn.\\" Another commercial jingle used in North East Ohio included the line \\"You'll find more of what you are hankerin' for, at the Red Barn.\\" Three mascots were used in the franchise's commercials: \\"Hamburger Hungry\\" (a humanoid figure with a hamburger in bun for a head); \\"Chicken Hungry\\" (a chicken leg); and \\"Big Fish Hungry\\" (a blue fish). In Australia, the appearance of Red Barney was common on Cartoon Corner with Daryl Somers. He was an affable clown who gave away prizes and preceded Ronald McDonald. In the spring of 1970, the chain found itself at the center of controversy when a franchisee wanted to erect a store in Dinkytown, a neighborhood adjacent to the University of Minnesota-East Bank campus in Minneapolis MN. Protestors, who were already riding a wave of anti-corporatism, as well as an anti-Vietnam war sentiment, occupied a vacant building on the property in which the Red Barn franchisee owned. The franchisee eventually demolished the building. However, the restaurant was never built, and the property was later sold off.

The organization rescues refugees hiding in China and resettles them in South Korea or the United States, so that they can avoid being forcibly repatriated back to North Korea, where they can face harsh punishments. The refugees first travel from China to Southeast Asia through what the organization calls an \\"Underground Railroad\\", and then on to South Korea where they are recognized as refugees. LiNK also seeks to raise awareness of human rights issues in North Korea through media production, conducting research, and through tours. Having sprung out of Korean-American student activism at universities in the United States, the organization grew rapidly and produced several feature- length documentaries, as well as TED talks by its leaders and rescuees. The organization now has a Research & Strategy department based in Seoul, that conducts research on North Korean issues with an emphasis on human rights issues. The organization positions itself as different from governmental positions and media narratives that focus on the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and other national security issues, focusing instead on refugees who were considered economic migrants by the Chinese government and who risked repatriation. LiNK provides ongoing support to resettlement programs for North Koreans beyond those provided by the South Korean government. History =Early years and leadership= Liberty in North Korea was founded at Yale University on March 27, 2004, the last day of the eighteenth annual Korean American Students Conference (KASCON) which described LiNK as \\"an explosive organization.\\" The charismatic co-founders were Adrian Hong and the comedian Paul Kim. The launch included a talk from a North Korean defector and video clips of escape attempts. In December 2004, LiNK sent two teams to the border of China and North Korea to interview North Korean refugees and to investigate conditions. Led by Adrian Hong, LiNK's name recognition spread through the efforts of Korean-Americans at universities and colleges who registered 40 chapters in a short period of time. Volunteers worked on staging protests, petition drives, and public awareness campaigns. In January 2007, Adrian Hong wrote that \\"two LiNK field workers and 6 North Korean refugees were caught and imprisoned by Chinese authorities\\" en route from Shenyang, and that Hong himself had been detained in Beijing. The Wall Street Journal took interest in the case and one of its reporters, Melanie Kirkpatrick, supported LiNK's activities in China in her book Escaping North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia‚Äôs Underground Railroad. The organization continued to grow and LiNK's mission expanded to include more field projects; by March 2007, LiNK had 100 chapters in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Korea. In March 2007, its director Adrian Hong stated that \\"LiNK has briefed and advocated to the highest levels of governments and agencies around the world,\\" then called for a day of fasting. In 2007‚Äì08, LiNK made changes to its strategy and leadership. In March 2007, LiNK altered its grassroots strategy and shifted to a membership-based model, which led to the disbanding of all chapters that year and a more unified approach to events. In the summer of 2008, Hannah Song took over as Executive Director, replacing Adrian Hong. Song began talks with Justin Wheeler of The Option, another organization focused on North Korean refugees, and in the fall of 2008 the two groups merged, retaining the structure and name of LiNK. South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported that \\"Hong left LiNK when he became convinced that bolder action was required in 2009,\\" and according to a statement made by LiNK, Adrian Hong's involvement with the organization ended around this time. Wheeler was a persuasive advocate for the organization, giving TED talks and other presentations in the early 2010s. Wheeler noted that from 2011, all funding received went to LiNK programs. =Move to Los Angeles= In 2009, LiNK moved from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. The organization also changed its activism strategy from political lobbying to bringing attention to the people of North Korea instead of the politics already frequently reported on. Beginning in the spring of 2009, they also began to send groups of interns to give presentations to schools, colleges, churches and other venues about the North Korean human rights crisis. LiNK has conducted 13 tours as of fall 2014, which occur twice a year on a semester basis. Refugee assistance LiNK has focused its work on North Korean refugees in China, who are vulnerable to exploitation and punishment in China, and can be repatriated if caught. If repatriated, North Koreans face reprisal in the forms of interrogation, prison camps, and execution. As a result, LiNK works to rescue North Korean refugees hiding in China and helps them escape through Southeast Asia. As of March 2019, LiNK had resettled 1,000 refugees throughout the U.S. and South Korea. According to LiNK, the cost of each rescue is $3,000 USD. LiNK coordinates a \\"Resettlement Assistance Program\\" to help newly resettled refugees. Raising awareness LiNK works to shift the attention on North Korea away from high politics and towards the North Korean people through a combination of media, tours, and campaigns. They are supported in their efforts by Rescue Teams. =Rescue Teams= Formerly known as chapters, Rescue Teams are groups formed at universities, colleges, high schools, churches, and other venues that raise funds for refugee rescues through bake sales, concerts, and other fundraising activities. =Tours= LiNK comments on North Korea via biannual national tours in the United States and Canada. Tours generally last eleven weeks and consist primarily of LiNK Nomads visiting high schools, colleges, churches, and other community locations to screen LiNK media and answer questions about North Korea and LiNK's work. =Campaigns= LiNK creates and implements campaigns which highlight specific facets of importance regarding North Korea and work to bring under-publicized issues to the attention of the public. The most recent campaign was titled Jangmadang, referring to the Korean word for \\"market\\" (Jangmadang) that is used in North Korea to refer to a place where North Koreans gather to buy and sell goods. Past campaigns have included Bridge (2013), SHIFT (2012), The Reliance (2011), and TheHundred (2009). Jangmadang (2014) Jangmadang focused on the markets (Jangmadang) that are proliferating in North Korea to circumvent the government's control of trade. These markets began forming in the late 1990s in response to a severe famine in the country and an inability of the government to provide adequate food supplies. The markets also provide a venue for information dissemination through electronic media, such as DVDs and portable DVD players, USB flash drives, SD cards, portable radios, Chinese cell phones with international calling capabilities, and through word-of- mouth. The event included videos from North Korean defectors Joo Yang, Yeon-mi Park, and Joseph Kim. The campaign ran during the fall of 2014. Bridge (2013) Bridge focused on rescuing \\"game-changers\\" who can build \\"bridges\\" of information and money back to North Korea. This campaign focuses on the power an individual has to bring change to North Korea. By helping these refugees, LiNK hoped to spark increased market and information-sharing activity within the country. The initiative's goal was to raise $200,000. SHIFT (2012) SHIFT was focused on changing the public's perception on North Korea from politics to the people. SHIFT encouraged people to tell the stories of the North Korean people themselves and to challenge media moguls to change the way that they are reporting on the North Korean issue. It has since become an integral part of LiNK's focus. The Reliance (2011) The Reliance was a drive to create a human network of people committed to seeing every North Korean refugee free. LiNK used social media to mobilize people across the world to start their own fundraising campaigns online with 100% of proceeds going to rescue missions. TheHundred (2009) TheHundred was started to kick start LiNK's fundraising efforts to begin rescuing refugees. The initial goal was to fund 100 rescue missions, which has since been accomplished. =Videos= Bridge to North Korea (2013) In the fall of 2013, LiNK released \\"Bridge to North Korea\\", which discussed the ongoing changes within the country as well as highlighting how refugees are helping to drive those changes even while residing in other countries by sending back money and information to their families. Danny from North Korea (2013) In 2013, LiNK released a documentary titled \\"Danny From North Korea\\". It features Danny Lee and focuses on his story of escape from North Korea in March 2005 and resettlement into the United States. It has been used in both their spring and fall tours of 2013, and has been featured in a number of independent film festivals. SHIFT campaign video (2012) In the fall of 2012, LiNK released a short film to support its SHIFT campaign, loosely referred to as \\"The SHIFT Campaign Video\\". Supported by an anonymous partner, every view of the video on YouTube raises $0.25 on behalf of LiNK's work. The People's Crisis (2012) In 2012, LiNK released its first independent feature-length documentary titled \\"The People's Crisis\\". Rather than seeking to evoke an emotional reaction, the film was purposed to inform the viewer about North Korea as a whole and LiNK's work. Summit Liberty in North Korea held its first Summit at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, in June 2014. North Korean speakers included activists Joseph Kim, Joo Yang, Yeon-mi Park and others. The event concluded with a private show from Run River North, David Choi, and Eatyourkimchi. Research and strategy LiNK's Research and Strategy department, led by Director of Research and Strategy Sokeel Park, contributes independent research and analysis to the North Korea issue while collaborating with experts around the globe in seeking an end to the North Korea crisis. Park is an academic with degrees from the London School of Economics and experience working at the United Nations. He regularly is quoted in major newspapers and on major broadcasts. His Research and Strategy team produces a weekly summary of North Korea-related news, which serves as an aggregate regarding North Korea's internal situation, human rights, economy and food security, refugee issues, international politics and security, and expert analysis and opinion. =Theory of change= LiNK advocates for a people-centered theory of change and lobbies on behalf of a citizen empowerment model. Their goals include the sharing of illegal media such as foreign DVDs and conveying subversive information fosters dependence on others outside the government. Marketization is another area of emphasis for change, recognizing that corruption among officials at local levels both eases access to foreign media easier and drives black market activity that erodes people's dependence on the regime. Cross-border trade and attendant ideological erosion are also areas which the organization sees as essential to change in North Korea. Partnerships LiNK partners with several like-minded organizations to increase its reach. One of these partnerships is with the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), which has collaborated with LiNK and the Simon Wiesenthal Center to host an event at the Museum of Tolerance titled \\"North Korea's Political Prisoner Camp System and the Plight of North Korean Refugees: A Call for Action\\". Media attention In May 2008, Google Tech Talk hosted an event with then-Director of LinK, Adrian Hong, and the North Korean refugee and former ambassador for LiNK, Shin Dong-hyuk. Shin spoke of his time with the organization in his New York Times-bestselling biography, \\"Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West,\\" written by Blaine Harden. In his book, he criticizes LiNK for excessively controlling his movements and appearances.Harden, Blaine. Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West. Viking, 2012, p. 185. Current President/CEO Hannah Song and Director of Research & Strategy Sokeel Park have each been hosted individually by TED. Joseph Kim, one of LiNK's first rescued refugees, also appeared at TED Global in June 2013. In a speech that reached more than one million viewers, he spoke about his life in North Korea during the famine of the 1990s, the family he lost and gained, and the power of hope. Adding a hard research edge to the more emotional narratives of North Korean escapees, Sokeel Park has been interviewed by major media outlets on topics regarding North Korea, and cited in The Economist . His writings have included \\"China's better route for North Korean refugees\\" and \\"Kim Jong-eun prepares balancing act\\" for Asia Times Online and \\"How to Build on Growing NKHR Interest\\" for Daily NK. In March 2019, LiNK founder Adrian Hong was identified in Spanish court documents as Adrian Hong Chang, the leader of an assault on the North Korean embassy in Madrid on February 21, 2019. LiNK responded to the controversy around this event with a statement to NK News: \\"Adrian Hong was a co-founder of Liberty in North Korea as a college student but has had no involvement with the organization for over ten years. We have no knowledge of his recent activities, and we have no information on the Madrid Embassy incident other than what has been published by the media.\\" LiNK publishes news and analysis via its blog and Facebook page. In addition, financially oriented annual reports are published each year, and this financial data is confirmed by GuideStar, a third-party charity monitoring service.

R. Simplot Company, a Boise, Idaho based agricultural supplier specializing in potato products. In 2007, he was estimated to be the 89th-richest person in the United States, at $3.6 billion. At the time of his death at age 99 in May 2008, he was the oldest billionaire on the Forbes 400. Early life Born in Dubuque, Iowa, he was the third of six children of Charles R. and Dorothy (Haxby) Simplot. His maternal grandmother was English, as were both parents of both his maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother. Both of his paternal grandfather's parents were French. A year later in 1910, the family relocated a thousand miles (1,600 km) west to homestead in the newly-irrigated Magic Valley of south central Idaho; the Minidoka Dam on the Snake River was completed a few years earlier. After differences with his authoritarian father, Simplot quit school in the eighth grade and left home to strike out on his own at age 14 in 1923. He then worked on a farm near Declo in Cassia County, where he developed a creative method for feeding hogs, before getting into the potato and vegetable processing business. J. R. Simplot Company By World War II, the J. R. Simplot Company had become the largest shipper of fresh potatoes in the nation. In 1967, Simplot and McDonald's founder Ray Kroc agreed by handshake that the Simplot Company would provide frozen french fries to the restaurant chain. Previously, restaurants had cut potatoes at each location for fresh french fries, but the favored russet potato was not available for three months in the summer, leading to a quality control problem. Simplot was able to supply frozen russet potatoes all year long. By 1972, all fries were frozen.: Behind the Arches, pp. 327‚Äì332, Love, John F., rev. ed., 1995, New York: Bantam Books The frozen fry deal led to expansion of Simplot potato processing plants and construction in 1977 of a new plant at Hermiston, Oregon. By 2005, Simplot supplied more than half of all french fries for the fast food chain. Simplot also produces fertilizers for agriculture. Simplot retired as president of his company in 1973, but remained as chairman until 1994. He held the title of Chairman Emeritus until his death in 2008. Simplot received an honorary degree from Utah State University in Logan in 2001,Honorary Degrees from Utah State University, honoring him for his many contributions to the agricultural industry of America, particularly the Intermountain West. Simplot was involved in the Potato Bust of 1976.The Asylum, Leah McGrath Goodman, Harper Collins, 2011 Further enhancing his enormous wealth, the J.R. Simplot Company provided startup capital in the early 1980s for the fledgling Micron Technology, a Boise-based manufacturer of computer memory chips. Additionally, he invested heavily in Remington Oil. In 1961, Simplot financed the Brundage Mountain ski area near McCall, two hours north of Boise. The Simplot Company sold its 50% interest in Brundage in April 2006 to the longtime co-owner, the DeBoer family. In the early 1950s, Simplot was the benefactor to the fledgling Bogus Basin ski area near Boise when it had financial difficulties; the base area lodge is named in his honor. In 1995, the J.R. Simplot Company expanded into Australia, acquiring iconic food brands like Birds Eye, Leggo's, Chiko, and Edgell. Simplot's first marriage was to Ruby Rosevear (1911‚Äì2004) of Glenns Ferry, whom he had met on a blind date; he proposed to her in his Model A Ford in 1931. After 29 years and four children, the marriage ended in divorce in 1960, when she suddenly left Simplot for another man. Years later, Simplot admitted that while he was growing his business empire in the 1950s, he had not spent enough time with his family. He and his second wife, Esther Becker (b.1934), a former opera singer, met in the mid 1960s in New York. He was on a business trip and she was working as a receptionist for the Henry Phipps Foundation; they were married in 1972. Before his death, Simplot and his wife Esther resided in the Grove Hotel building in downtown Boise, a few blocks from the company's headquarters. The couple donated their hilltop home, in Boise's north end, to the state of Idaho in late 2004 for use as a governor's mansion. (Known as \\"The Idaho House,\\" it was returned to the Simplot family in 2013, and demolished in January 2016.) Accident On January 1, 2007, while attending the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, with his wife and son, Simplot fell from a motorized scooter and suffered a cranial hematoma. He was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, where he spent his 98th birthday. Simplot returned to Idaho several days later for further rehabilitation. Death Simplot died suddenly at his home at age 99 on May 25, 2008, with his wife at his side, following a bout of pneumonia from which he appeared to be recovering. His death occurred moments after he had invited a friend to his home to play cards. Simplot was survived by his wife, two sons, Don and Scott, and his daughter, Gay; his eldest son, Richard (Dick), died in 1993 at age 59. He was also survived by 18 grandchildren, 25 great- grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild. He was interred at Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. In 1996, Simplot was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.

The EOS system features the new EF lens mount, which uses electrical signals to communicate between the camera and the lens. Focusing and aperture control are performed by electric motors mounted in the lens body. The EF mount is still used on Canon SLRs, including digital models. Canon's previous FD mount lenses are incompatible with EOS bodies. Canon's first EOS camera had the latest technologies, including a microprocessor and a Canon-developed BASIS sensor for high-precision AF. Canon claimed incomparable autofocusing for the EOS 650. A range of high-precision ultrasonic motor EF autofocus lenses were also developed successfully for the 650. An EOS 650 was used in 1992 to take the first photographic image that was uploaded on the World Wide Web, a picture of the band Les Horribles Cernettes.How the first photo was posted on the Web 20 years ago, Andrew Hough, The Telegraph, 11 July 2012 The EOS 5D Mark III DSLR was announced on the 25th anniversary of the announcement of the EOS 650. Variants The more advanced EOS 620 followed in May 1987, and the EOS 630/600 in March 1989. The 620 was equipped with multiple exposure and auto-bracketing capability, and a higher flash sync speed of 1/250 and shutter speed of 1/4000. The 630 had interchangeable viewing screens and faster autofocus, and was capable of faster film transport at 5 frames per second over the 650's 3 fps.

When a single fungus produces multiple morphologically distinct anamorphs, these are called synanamorphs. *Holomorph: the whole fungus, including anamorphs and teleomorph. Dual naming of fungi Fungi are classified primarily based on the structures associated with sexual reproduction, which tend to be evolutionarily conserved. However, many fungi reproduce only asexually, and cannot easily be classified based on sexual characteristics; some produce both asexual and sexual states. These problematic species are often members of the Ascomycota, but a few of them belong to the Basidiomycota. Even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually, often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions. Additionally, fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and sporulate amongst each other. These facts have made it very difficult to link the various states of the same fungus. Fungi that are not known to produce a teleomorph were historically placed into an artificial phylum, the \\"Deuteromycota,\\" also known as \\"fungi imperfecti,\\" simply for convenience. Some workers hold that this is an obsolete concept, and that molecular phylogeny allows accurate placement of species which are known from only part of their life cycle. Others retain the term \\"deuteromycetes,\\" but give it a lowercase \\"d\\" and no taxonomic rank. Historically, Article 59 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi (anamorphs) separate names from their sexual states (teleomorphs);Article 59 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature but this practice was discontinued as of 1 January 2013. The dual naming system can be confusing for novices. It is essential for workers in plant pathology, mold identification, medical mycology, and food microbiology, fields in which asexually reproducing fungi are commonly encountered.  From dual system to single nomenclature  The separate names for anamorphs of fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle has been an issue of debate since the phenomenon was recognized in the mid-19th century. This was even before the first international rules for botanical nomenclature were issued in 1867. Special provisions are to be found in the earliest Codes, which were then modified several times, and often substantially. The rules have been updated regularly and become increasingly complex, and by the mid-1970s they were being interpreted in different ways by different mycologists ‚Äì even ones working on the same genus. Following intensive discussions under the auspices of the International Mycological Association, drastic changes were made at the International Botanical Congress in 1981 to clarify and simplify the procedures ‚Äì and the new terms anamorph, teleomorph, and holomorph entered general use. An unfortunate effect of the simplification was that many name changes had to be made, including for some well-known and economically important species; at that date, the conservation of species names was not allowed under the Code. Unforeseen in the 1970s, when the 1981 provisions were crafted, was the impact of molecular systematics. A decade later, it was starting to become obvious that fungi with no known sexual stage could confidently be placed in genera which were typified by species in which the sexual stage was known. This possibility of abandoning the dual nomenclatural system was debated at subsequent International Mycological Congresses and on other occasions, and the need for change was increasingly recognized. At the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005, some minor modifications were made which allowed anamorph-typified names to be epitypified by material showing the sexual stage when it was discovered, and for that anamorph name to continue to be used. The 1995 edition of the influential Ainsworth and Bisby‚Äôs Dictionary of the Fungi sought to replace the term anamorph with mitosporic fungus and teleomorph with meiosporic fungus, based on the idea that the fundamental distinction is whether mitosis or meiosis preceded sporulation. This is a controversial choice because it is not clear that the morphological differences which traditionally define anamorphs and teleomorphs line up completely with sexual practices, or whether those sexual practices are sufficiently well understood in some cases. The Vienna Congress (2005) established a Special Committee to investigate the issue further, but it was unable to reach a consensus. Matters were becoming increasingly desperate as mycologists using molecular phylogenetic approaches started to ignore the provisions, or interpret them in different ways. One fungus, one name The International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 made a change in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and adopted the principle \\"one fungus, one name\\". After 1 January 2013, one fungus can only have one name; the system of permitting separate names to be used for anamorphs then ended. This means that all legitimate names proposed for a species, regardless of what stage they are typified by, can serve as the correct name for that species. All names now compete on an equal footing for priority. In order not to render illegitimate the names that had been introduced in the past for separate morphs, it was agreed that these should not be treated as superfluous alternative names in the sense of the Code. It was further decided that no anamorph-typified name should be taken up to displace a widely used teleomorph-typified name without the case's having been considered by the General Committee established by the Congress. Recognizing that there were cases in some groups of fungi where there could be many names that might merit formal retention or rejection, a new provision was introduced: Lists of names can be submitted to the General Committee and, after due scrutiny, names accepted on those lists are to be treated as conserved over competing synonyms (and listed as Appendices to the Code). Lichen-forming fungi (but not lichenicolous fungi) had always been excluded from the provisions permitting dual nomenclature. The problem of choosing one name among many remains to be examined for many large, agriculturally or medically-important genera like Aspergillus and Fusarium. Articles have been published on such specific genera to propose ways to define them under the newer rules.

As a concert organist, she performs at concerts throughout North America and Europe. Bish also continues to tape episodes for her television series by visiting notable organs throughout the world.  Education and personal life  Diane Bish was born in Wichita, Kansas with the given name of Diane Joyce Bish. Bish changed her middle name from \\"Joyce\\" to \\"Joy\\" after graduating from high school. Bish began piano lessons when she was 6 years old and started organ lessons at age 14. She noted that her foundation in piano gave her the background needed to succeed with organ studies, which required not only excellent keyboard technique but also added in the pedal. Bish graduated from Wichita East High School in Wichita, Kansas, in 1959.Woodruff, Warren L., Diane Bish: First Lady of the Organ, Atlanta, GA: SW Concerts, 1993. She had played on the 1925 Austin Organ installed in the school auditorium. In 1984, she returned there to play a benefit concert, which raised enough money for the organ to be restored. She became interested in the organ as a young child who listened to the Mormon Tabernacle organist on Sunday morning programs, as well as recordings of E. Power Biggs. Bish began studying organ as a student of Dorothy Addy, who challenged her to learn much of the classic organ repertoire during her high school years, which helped her later when she needed a variety of music for concerts and programs. In college, she studied under Mildred Andrews. Later, she was a recipient of Fulbright and French government grants for study in Amsterdam with Gustav Leonhardt, and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Marie-Claire Alain. Bish credited Leonhardt with teaching her \\"the art of music.\\" Leonhardt taught both the harpsichord and the organ and emphasized articulation and spacing in his lessons. Bish began her college career on a full scholarship at Asbury College in Kentucky, which had a four-manual Austin pipe organ. In her junior year, Bish transferred to the University of Oklahoma, after auditioning to become a student of Mildred Andrews at the university. After receiving her Bachelor of Music degree, Bish stayed at the university to earn a Master of Music degree. While at the University of Oklahoma, Bish joined the Mu Kappa chapter of Mu Phi Epsilon, an international, co-educational professional music fraternity that is composed of collegiate chapters, alumni chapters, and allied members. She joined the organization for the camaraderie of fellow musicians as well as the opportunities it offered, such as musical activities and competitions. On October 31, 2002, in Bloomington, Indiana, a fire consumed the home that Bish shared with harpist Susann McDonald. Among the many personal possessions lost were a Yamaha grand piano and Rodgers digital organ, but both women escaped without injuries. Bish also lost most of her signature concert attire in the fire. Despite a busy schedule of concerts and program tapings, Bish believes in living a well-rounded life. While practice is important for a musician's success, she has also enjoyed sports and being with friends and family. She describes herself as a people person and enjoys traveling, fishing, snow skiing, and animals, especially Poodles or Maltese dogs. When asked if she has any vices, Bish admits to procrastination at times, as well as taking a break from 3 to 4 p.m. to \\"have a cup of coffee, some chocolate, and I sit with my dog and just enjoy being alive.\\" As of 2020, she makes her home in Naples, Florida. Her advice for young musicians is to determine what they want to do and then work hard at it. It is important to learn good technique with a serious teacher. It is also important to think about musical interpretation. She noted, \\"Don't be a robot ‚Äì technique is one thing, but without the heart, the soul, the music doesn't touch people.\\"  Career  After graduating with her Master's degree, Bish was the organist at the East Heights Methodist Church in Wichita, Kansas. She left for a year to study in Amsterdam, and then returned to the church organist position. She also taught organ and harpsichord at Friends University for two years, along with continuing to offer concerts and lectures. In 1969, Bish received a scholarship from the French government to return to Europe for further study with Marie-Claire Alain. Upon her return from Europe, she moved to Wichita Falls, Texas to teach for a year, before realizing that, instead of teaching, she wanted to have a church job and continue her performance career. Besides her teachers, three organists, in particular, had an influence on her musical style. She used to listen to recordings of E. Power Biggs, as well as Alexander Schreiner, who was the organist on the Sunday morning Mormon Tabernacle programs on the radio. In addition, she was acquainted with the organist Virgil Fox. Bish has stated that she has tried to combine the styles of Biggs and Fox, while choosing inspirational literature that makes use of the full resources of the organ, as Schreiner did. Beginning in the 1970s, Bish served for more than 20 years as organist and artist-in-residence at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where she designed the 117-rank Ruffatti organ in the sanctuary. She also co-founded the church's concert series as well as the Church Music Explosion international workshop for church musicians. Bish continues to perform occasionally at the church, most recently in an April 12, 2019 concert that featured two of her works, Symphony of Hymns and the Passion Symphony, which were written for the Ruffatti organ. Bish has been on television for most of her career. Her first regular appearances were on the Coral Ridge Hour, a weekly television series that was produced at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. In 1982, she began recording The Joy of Music. No longer resident organist at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Bish made frequent concert appearances at recitals throughout North America. During her concerts, she shows the audience what the organ she is playing that day can do, making sure to include music that includes stops \\"from the tiniest flutes to big, thunderous sounds.\\" She also explains the music by introducing nearly every number played. Even when Bish was playing full-time at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, she was free to travel as a concert organist. When playing a new organ, she first registers it, or memorizes where all of the stops are. She explained, \\"The first thing I do when I sit down at a new organ is just register it. I don't actually play that much because it's very important to know, first of all, where everything is. I don't preset a lot of things. It's just something I've had to do, and I find whether you have a little time or a lot, you tend to take the time you have.\\" While it can be a challenge to play different organs, it is also rewarding to figure out how to produce different effects on new organs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated the cancellation of many church services and concerts, Bish found a creative way to bring the joy of the organ to her neighbors on Easter Sunday 2020. She played a concert from her home organ, using an additional sound system through large, opened patio doors. More than 150 people attended. Bish has written numerous musical compositions, including original works and arrangements of hymns and other works, and writes everything out by hand. She has to be in the mood for the work of composing, noting that she needs to \\"be at peace, and be composed to compose.\\" Woodruff noted that Bish has \\"produced her richest compositions at the happiest points in her life, in the moments of great personal triumph. Unlike many other composers, Diane cannot compose as an escape from sorrow or frustration. She must be in a content and cheerful frame of mind.\\" Bish has also completed numerous hymn arrangements. In a hymn arrangement, she tries to bring out the melody while making use of rhythm. She laments \\"unimaginative\\" arrangements, noting that \\"we have a whole orchestra to use in terms of the organ, and in my hymn arrangements, I try to utilize them all.\\" Bish also reads the verses of the hymn so that her arrangements are reflective of the message of the hymn. In addition to her work as a recitalist, television host/producer, and composer, Bish is also an organ designer. As noted above, Bish designed the Ruffatti organ that was installed in 1974 at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, working with Pierro Ruffatti and architect Harold Wagoner. A dedication service and recital by Bish were held on January 5, 1975. The Diane Bish Signature Series of organs is available through the Allen Organ Company. In an interview where she was asked about these organs, Bish said, \\"My organs have more of the French in them, the reeds are more French. They‚Äôll play anything in the strings. That‚Äôs one thing I really like in an organ ‚Äî good strings. They‚Äôre very rich, very beautiful and warm, and the reeds are very fiery and exciting. The flutes are also very distinct, whether they‚Äôre a German flute or a harmonic flute or whatever, they‚Äôre very distinct. That‚Äôs very important in an organ. So I tried to pull all those aspects together in my organs.\\" The Diane Bish Signature Series of organs also include special console finishes and six complete stop lists, including Classic Allen, Cavaill√©-Coll, Schlicker, English Cathedral, Aeolian- Skinner and Arp Schnitger. Bish is known for her elegant concert attire and sparkly organ shoes. Many of her gowns are custom-made or adapted from clothing bought off the rack. Bish said that her attire helps to create a concert performance atmosphere, noting that other concert performers do not wear black robes to perform. She regularly receives comments from fans about her attire. The organ shoes that Bish wears are gold with rhinestones and are designed by her manager, Janet Jarriel. Originally, the rhinestones were multicolored, but in 2006, the shoe design was changed to use white rhinestones, which also surround the heel of the shoes. One book has been written about Bish and her life. This book, First Lady of the Organ, Diane Bish: A Biography, by Warren L. Woodruff, was partially based on a doctoral dissertation by Woodruff about Bish and her work. Bish herself is also an author. In 1977, she published Church Music Explosion, which provided information and inspiration for church musicians, especially church organists. The book was updated with a new edition in 1982. The book provided guidance for the organist in selecting music, playing for worship services, working with others, and establishing a concert series. In addition, there was advice on how to demonstrate the organ to children, to build an audience for the future, along with suggested repertoire listings that could be utilized with both choirs and organs. In 2013, Bish authored a book of faith entitled Warnings! End Time Scenarios, which was dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This 110-page book featured scenarios of people who unexpectedly faced life-changing challenges and disasters; each chapter began with Bible verses that were appropriate to the situations described. In the introduction to the book, Bish noted that she had been reading various print and online sources that led her to think about how contemporary events mirrored end-time events predicted in the Bible. Accordingly, the purpose of the book was to issue a reminder that people should \\"hear the life-changing good news of the gospel\\" before it was too late. Faith has been an important element for Bish throughout her career. She noted that she always tries to include music that provides spiritual inspiration in each of her concerts. In addition, despite her renowned talent, Bish always attributes her success to God. Her sister, Judy (Bish) Priest, was quoted as saying: \\"‚ÄúDiane is very, very gifted,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut she always gives God the glory. She knows where her gifts come from.‚Äù = The Joy of Music Program = There are three purposes for The Joy of Music program, according to Bish: \\"To feature great churches and organs with performances of classical and sacred music; to reflect 'Excellence in all things and all things to God's glory;' and to educate, inspire, and enrich the lives of people through God's gifts of creation.\\" The idea for what became The Joy of Music began when Bish listened to recordings of E. Power Biggs playing famous European organs. When she was in high school, she thought it would be nice for listeners to be able to see the organs and their surroundings as well as hear them. After graduating from college, when Bish was studying in Europe and playing different European organs, she continued to think about her dream of eventually hosting a television program. During her time at Coral Ridge, Bish began producing the weekly television program of organ music, The Joy of Music. A music writer for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper said in 1986 that Bish \\"combines masterful music and religion in a life filled with church work, concerts, and writing and producing her own TV show\\". It had taken ten years of work to make the new program a reality. Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church had constructed a new church, with a new Ruffatti organ, in 1974. The new church had television cameras that were used to broadcast the services. Between 1971 and 1981, Bish wrote proposals for a potential series but was unable to garner any interest. Then, in 1981, a supporter donated $20,000 and Bish was able to create two pilot episodes in 1982. The pilot episodes included a Christmas program and a program for trumpet and organ. The donor also knew the owner of Trinity Broadcasting Network, Paul Crouch. From this contact, Trinity Broadcasting put The Joy of Music into a national 8:30 p.m. slot on Friday evenings, giving the new program an audience of millions. By 1984, Bish began traveling to Europe to record episodes on famous organs throughout the continent. These episodes combined music and a travelogue with information about the organs, churches, cities, art, and scenery. Bish stated that the travel aspect of the programs helped to bring in additional viewers. In addition, she played a variety of music on the program, so that every listener could find something enjoyable. This was especially important to be able to reach listeners who did not know much about the organ. The Joy of Music tapings have occurred in many famous cathedrals on well-known organs. Bish noted that when playing the organs that were also played by Bach, Handel, or Mozart, \\"you're touching history when you do that. It's pretty amazing, really.\\" When determining the locale for a taping, 90 percent of the time, Bish first decides on an organ that she would like to feature, and then builds the tour around that instrument. Bish serves as executive producer of the program and is involved in all aspects of its production. She spends a lot of time at The Joy of Music office taking care of paperwork and planning. She writes all of the scripts, drawing upon her earlier writing experience as the editor of her high school newspaper to write succinct commentary for the show. When writing the commentary, she does all of the research on the music she will play, information on the composers, the churches and organs, and the locations where she visits. Bish also enjoys working with guest artists, including violinists, choirs, brass ensembles, and even an Alp hornist. When planning a tour, Bish first selects the location and the guest artists. She then selects the music and begins to prepare it, while doing the research for the programs. Once on location, all of the musical pieces and all of the introductory and regional scenes are shot live. Once the taping has concluded, Bish handles the initial review of the finished footage to decide what will be included in each program. She is also responsible for approval of the program once the footage is arranged in its final production stage. One taping trip can result in over forty hours of footage to edit, and a two-week trip can include six to eight tapings. It can take a year to plan a European tour because the churches, guest artists, and camera crews have to be lined up. Fundraising also needs to occur. In addition, Bish works with a tour company to open the trips up to fans and friends, which are then advertised on The Joy of Music website. The majority of current European Joy of Music trips utilize a riverboat for travel between sites. This has made touring easier, because there is no need to pack and unpack when moving from city to city. At each stop, the group visits a church and Bish records for the program. After the records are finished, Bish then tapes the introductions and information shots that are included on the program. For the first 15 years of the program, 26 episodes per year were produced, each of which would be repeated once to cover a 52-week programming span. Currently, fewer programs are produced each year because of expense. When producing the full 26 episodes per year, it was necessary to raise an average of US$350,000‚Äì$400,050. Ninety percent of the funding for the program comes from donations. Other funding and support is provided by corporate sponsors. Production of The Joy of Music is expensive because when traveling, the guest artists, crew, and equipment must be transported to the taping sites. Proper equipment must be obtained. Following a taping trip, there are editing hours, along with production, duplication, and distribution costs, and staff costs to prepare the files for television stations. Bish once noted, \\"We literally sweat it out every month and pray that the money will come in. We do so much on so little that Hollywood would laugh at our small budget for one show.\\" Bish has encountered challenges when filming The Joy of Music. It is sometimes difficult to secure permission to tape in churches and cathedrals because there have been problems in the past with other television crews at these locations. In addition, scheduling time in the churches can be difficult. Bish related the time when her crew had to start taping at midnight because there was a light show and a trumpet recital scheduled there first. At the Strasbourg Cathedral, filming had to be done in the middle of the night, and there were 130 steps plus a walk out onto the roof in order to reach the organ loft. The organ loft was mounted 80 feet high on a wall, and the camera person was afraid of heights. Furthermore, the restrooms were downstairs. There were also environmental issues, such as at the Ettal Monastery in Bavaria that was so cold that everyone had to wear coats, Bish had to warm her hands with a hair dryer between pieces, and the soloist's breath could be seen on the tape of the program. The console of the organ caught on fire in Notre Dame and lightning struck the church where Bish was to play in Germany. Bish does not often have the time to rehearse extensively prior to taping a program. Due to scheduling, The Joy of Music team is generally allowed only one day at a location. She sometimes can rehearse for only an hour and a half prior to recording, while the camera crew sets up. The churches generally do not close because of the taping, so there is background noise to contend with during taping. The actual recording takes place over three to four hours, followed by taping of the introduction and information sections for the program. Outdoor filming of the surrounding area also has to be done. The whole process can take up to 14 to 16 hours in one day. Once all of the work is finished, Bish and her crew go to eat. As of 2018, The Joy of Music continues to feature her performances, taped on location at prominent organs in North America and Europe. The Joy of Music is seen in North America via independent, faith-based, and satellite networks, and selected PBS stations. The show has an international audience via Eternal Word Television Network, The Church Channel, BibelTV, Roku, VelugaTV, Gospel Channel, Alfa/Omega TV, and YouTube. The program can be seen by over 300,000 people worldwide on a weekly basis. The program receives letters from many different countries, including Ghana, Thailand, Uganda, and Italy. In 2017, a Joy of Music live stream was added to the show's YouTube channel to enable listeners to tune in 24-hours per day. Since the program's beginning in the early 1980s, Bish has recorded over 500 episodes, each of which shows her playing one or more different pipe or digital organs. Many people tell her that they began playing the organ because of The Joy of Music program.  Awards and honors  Bish began winning organ competitions during college. In her junior and senior years at the University of Oklahoma, she placed first in the American Guild of Organists' Competition. She also won the National Organ Competition of the National Federation of Music Clubs, as well as the Original Composition Contest of the Mu Phi Epsilon National Competition. In 1989, Bish was awarded the National Citation by the National Federation of Music Clubs of America, considered to be the Federation's highest honor; this award was previously given to other music legends including Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, Van Cliburn, and Robert Shaw. In 1994, she received the Elizabeth Mathias Award, one of Mu Phi Epsilon's highest honors. On April 29, 2016, Bish was awarded the inaugural Distinguished Career Award by the New York City Chapter of the American Guild of Organists, presented to her at the historic Marble Collegiate Church. On November 4, 2016, Bish was named the organist emeritus of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. Also in November 2016, Bish was honored as one of the 2016 Women of Distinction by Celebrating Women International (CWI) in Nassau, Bahamas. This award is reserved for women who have made significant contributions worldwide in many fields, including the arts. On April 7‚Äì8, 2018, Bish was honored by her alma mater, the University of Oklahoma. The American Organ Institute at the University of Oklahoma held a Gala Weekend in her honor, which included a private master class, a gala dinner, and a special concert, which featured many of her musical works. A scholarship in her name would also be established.  Discography  Bish has made over thirty recordings on many of the great organs of the world, including the celebrated M√ºller organ of the St.-Bavokerk (or Grote Kerk) in Haarlem, Netherlands, Canterbury Cathedral, and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. She is the first American woman to record at the organ of Freiburg Cathedral in Freiburg, Germany.

From 1934 to 1936, he served as the Giants reserve catcher, working behind Gus Mancuso. In 1934 in spring training, despite a team reservation Jewish ballplayers Phil Weintraub and Danning were refused entry to the Flamingo Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, which had a \\"No Jews\\" policy. However, they were allowed to stay when Giants manager Bill Terry threatened he would take the whole team to another hotel if his Jewish ballplayers were not allowed in.Jews and Baseball: Volume 1, Entering the American Mainstream, 1871‚Äì1948 - Burton A. Boxerman, Benita W. BoxermanJewish Major Leaguers in Their Own Words: Oral Histories of 23 Players - Peter Ephross, Martin Abramowitz In the 1937 season, Danning and Mancuso shared the catching duties with Danning appearing in 93 games, while Mancuso appeared in 86 games. In 1938 Danning took over the role as the Giants starting catcher. He was selected for the National League All-Star squad in four consecutive years (1938‚Äì41), was on the world champion Giants team which defeated the Washington Senators in the 1933 World Series, and appeared in the pennant-winning clubs that were defeated by the New York Yankees in the 1936 and 1937 World Series. From 1938 through 1940 Danning hit .306, .313 and .300, and finished in the top 10 in National League MVP voting in 1939 (9th) and 1940 (7th). He collected career highs in home runs (16) in 1939, and in RBIs (91) in 1940. He led all National League catchers with a .991 fielding average in 1939. On June 9, 1939 against the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds at the Polo Grounds, Danning was one of five Giants to hit a home run in the fourth inning, breaking the prior record of four home runs by a team in one inning. Remarkably, all five were hit by the Giants with two outs. Then, on June 15, 1940, he hit for the cycle in a game against Pittsburgh. His home run came on an inside-the-park home run that landed on the fly in front of the Giants' clubhouse, wedged behind the Eddie Grant memorial. Through 2010, he was ninth all-time in career hits (behind Al Rosen) among Jewish major league baseball players. Career statistics In addition to batting .300 or higher in three consecutive seasons, Danning had a .285 career batting average, tying Yogi Berra for the 18th highest lifetime batting average among Hall of Fame eligible major league baseball catchers. He hit 57 lifetime home runs and 397 RBIs in 890 games. He had a career fielding percentage of .985, leading National League catchers three times in putouts, and twice in assists and baserunners caught stealing,.

Published continuously since 1872, it has carried the tagline, \\"The International News Magazine of Book Publishing and Bookselling\\". With 51 issues a year, the emphasis today is on book reviews. The magazine was founded by bibliographer Frederick Leypoldt in the late 1860s, and had various titles until Leypoldt settled on the name The Publishers' Weekly (with an apostrophe) in 1872. The publication was a compilation of information about newly published books, collected from publishers and from other sources by Leypoldt, for an audience of booksellers. By 1876, Publishers Weekly was being read by nine tenths of the booksellers in the country. In 1878, Leypoldt sold The Publishers' Weekly to his friend Richard Rogers Bowker, in order to free up time for his other bibliographic endeavors.Beswick, Jay W. The Work of Frederick Leypoldt, Bibliographer and Publisher. R. R. Bowker, 1942. Eventually the publication expanded to include features and articles. Harry Thurston Peck was the first editor-in-chief of The Bookman, which began in 1895. Peck worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906, and in 1895, he created the world's first bestseller list for its pages. In 1912, Publishers Weekly began to publish its own bestseller lists, patterned after the lists in The Bookman. These were not separated into fiction and non-fiction until 1917, when World War I brought an increased interest in non-fiction by the reading public. Through much of the 20th century, Publishers Weekly was guided and developed by Frederic Gershom Melcher (1879‚Äì1963), who was editor and co-editor of Publishers' Weekly and chairman of the magazine's publisher, R. R. Bowker, over four decades. Born April 12, 1879, in Malden, Massachusetts, Melcher began at age 16 in Boston's Estes & Lauriat Bookstore, where he developed an interest in children's books. He moved to Indianapolis in 1913 for another bookstore job. In 1918, he read in Publishers' Weekly that the magazine's editorship was vacant. He applied to Richard Rogers Bowker for the job, was hired, and moved with his family to Montclair, New Jersey. He remained with R. R. Bowker for 45 years. While at Publishers Weekly, Melcher began creating space in the publication and a number of issues dedicated solely to books for children. In 1919, he teamed with Franklin K. Mathiews, librarian for the Boy Scouts of America, and Anne Carroll Moore, a librarian at the New York Public Library, to create Children‚Äôs Book Week. When Bowker died in 1933, Melcher succeeded him as president of the company; he resigned in 1959 to become chairman of the board of directors. In 1943, Publishers Weekly created the Carey‚ÄìThomas Award for creative publishing, naming it in honor of Mathew Carey and Isaiah Thomas. Writers and readers In 2008, the magazine's circulation was 25,000. In 2004, the breakdown of those 25,000 readers was given as 6000 publishers; 5500 public libraries and public library systems; 3800 booksellers; 1600 authors and writers; 1500 college and university libraries; 950 print, film and broad media; and 750 literary and rights agents, among others. Subject areas covered by Publishers Weekly include publishing, bookselling, marketing, merchandising and trade news, along with author interviews and regular columns on rights, people in publishing, and bestsellers. It attempts to serve all involved in the creation, production, marketing and sale of the written word in book, audio, video and electronic formats. The magazine increases the page count considerably for four annual special issues: Spring Adult Announcements, Fall Adult Announcements, Spring Children's Announcements, and Fall Children's Announcements. Book reviews The book review section of Publishers Weekly was added in the early 1940s and grew in importance during the 20th century and through the present day. It currently offers prepublication reviews of 9,000 new trade books each year, in a comprehensive range of genres and including audiobooks and e-books, with a digitized archive of 200,000 reviews. Reviews appear two to four months prior to the publication date of a book, and until 2014, when PW launched BookLife.com, a website for self-published books, books already in print were seldom reviewed. These anonymous reviews are short, averaging 200‚Äì250 words, and it is not unusual for the review section to run as long as 40 pages, filling the second half of the magazine. In the past, a book review editorial staff of eight editors assigned books to more than 100 freelance reviewers. Some are published authors, and others are experts in specific genres or subjects. Although it might take a week or more to read and analyze some books, reviewers were paid $45 per review until June 2008 when the magazine introduced a reduction in payment to $25 a review. In a further policy change that month, reviewers received credit as contributors in issues carrying their reviews. Currently, there are nine reviews editors listed in the masthead. Now titled \\"Reviews\\", the review section began life as \\"Forecasts.\\" For several years, that title was taken literally; reviews were followed with italicized comments that attempted to predict a book's sales success. Genevieve Stuttaford, who greatly expanded the number of reviews during her tenure as the nonfiction \\"Forecasts\\" editor, joined the PW staff in 1975. Previously, she was a Saturday Review associate editor, reviewer for Kirkus Reviews and for 12 years on the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle. During the 23 years Stuttaford was with Publishers Weekly, book reviewing was increased from an average of 3,800 titles a year in the 1970s to well over 6,500 titles in 1997. She retired in 1998. Several notable PW editors stand out for making their mark on the magazine. Barbara Bannon was the head fiction reviewer during the 1970s and early 1980s, becoming the magazine‚Äôs executive editor during that time and retiring in 1983. She was, notably, the first reviewer to insist that her name be appended to any blurb of her reviews, thus drawing attention to herself, to the review and to the influence of the magazine in predicting a book‚Äôs popularity and salability. Sybil Steinberg came to Publishers Weekly in the mid 1970s and served as a reviews editor for 30 years, taking over after Barbara Bannon retired. Under Steinberg, PW instituted the starred review, a first in the industry, to indicate books of exceptional merit. She also called out particular books of merit by starting the practice of boxed reviews, a precursor to the PW \\"signature reviews,‚Äù boxed reviews that are attributed to the reviewer. The \\"Best Books\\" lists were also Steinberg‚Äôs brainchild, and these lists are still published annually, usually in November ahead of \\"Best Books\\" lists from the New York Times and other prominent review venues. Steinberg edited the magazine's author interviews, and beginning in 1992 put together four anthologies of them in book form, published by the Pushcart Press. Formerly of InStyle magazine, novelist Louisa Ermelino took the reins of the PW review section in 2005. Under her watch, the number of reviews grew once again, to nearly 9,000 per year from 6,500. In a sea change for the magazine, Ermelino oversaw the integration of self-published book reviews into the main review section of the magazine. Review editors vet and assign self-published books for review, which reviews are then published alongside the reviews of traditionally published books each week in the magazine. Publishers Weekly does not charge for self- published book reviews, bucking a trend within the industry led by Kirkus Reviews and Foreword‚Äôs Clarion fee-for-review service, both of which offer independent book reviews in exchange for fees in the hundreds of dollars. Publishers Weekly does syndicate its reviews to a variety of online retail venues such as Amazon, Apple Books, Powell‚Äôs Books, Books-a-Million and others. The reviews are also carried by library database services such as Baker and Taylor, ProQuest, Bowker, Cengage, EBSCO and others. Magazines and mergers Cover of November 6, 2006 For most of its history, Publishers Weekly, along with the Library Journal-related titles, were owned by founding publisher R. R. Bowker. When Reed Publishing purchased Bowker from Xerox in 1985, it placed Publishers Weekly under the management of its Boston-based Cahners Publishing Company, the trade publishing empire founded by Norman Cahners, which Reed Publishing had purchased in 1977. The merger of Reed with the Netherlands-based Elsevier in 1993 led to many Cahners cutbacks amid takeover turmoil. Nora Rawlinson, who once headed a $4 million book selection budget at the Baltimore County Library System, edited Library Journal for four years before stepping in as editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly from 1992 to 2005. Sara Nelson era Beginning January 24, 2005, the magazine came under the direction of a new editor-in-chief, veteran book reviewer Sara Nelson, known for her publishing columns in the New York Post and The New York Observer. A senior contributing editor for Glamour, in addition to editorial positions at Self, Inside.com, and Book Publishing Report, she had gained attention and favorable reviews as the author of So Many Books, So Little Time: A Year of Passionate Reading (Putnam, 2003), in which she stirred a year's worth of reading into a memoir mix of her personal experiences after a New Year's resolution to read a book each week. Nelson began to modernize Publishers Weekly with new features and a makeover by illustrator and graphic designer Jean-Claude Suares. The many alterations included added color (with drop shadows behind color book covers), Nelson's own weekly editorial, illustrated bestseller lists, and \\"Signature\\", longer boxed reviews written by well-known novelists. The switch to a simple abbreviated logo of initials effectively changed the name of the magazine to PW, the name long used for the magazine within the book industry. She also introduced the magazine's Quill Awards, with nominees in 19 categories selected by a nominating board of 6,000 booksellers and librarians. Winners were determined by the reading public, who could vote at kiosks in Borders stores or online at the Quills site. Reed Business dropped the Quill Awards in 2008. In the past, the front covers of Publishers Weekly were used to display advertisements by book publishers, and this policy was changed to some degree in 2005. Although new PW covers now feature illustrations and photographs tied to interior articles, these covers are often hidden behind a front cover foldout advertisement. The visual motif of each cover is sometimes repeated on the contents page. The Nelson years were marked by turbulence within the industry as well as a continuing trend away from serious writing and towards pop culture. Publishers Weekly had enjoyed a near monopoly over the past decades, but it was getting vigorous competition from Internet sites, e-mail newsletters, and daily newspapers. The industry was consolidating. Many independent booksellers, who had been bread- and-butter clients of Publishers Weekly, were going out of business. Paid circulation dropped by 3,000 to 25,000 in the mid-2000s, Nelson pushed for significant changes towards modernization, greater use of the Web, and more focus on analytical reporting, but she was contending with economic forces working against the book buying market, problems she addressed in a 2005 interview: Advertising downturn and sale In 2008, faced with a decline in advertising support, Reed's management sought a new direction. In January 2009, Sara Nelson was dismissed along with executive editor Daisy Maryles, who had been with PW for more than four decades. Stepping in as editorial director was Brian Kenney, editorial director of School Library Journal and Library Journal. The dismissals, which sent shockwaves through the industry, were widely covered in newspapers. In April 2010, George W. Slowik Jr., a former publisher of the magazine, purchased Publishers Weekly from Reed Business Information, under the company PWxyz, LLC. Cevin Bryerman remained as publisher along with co-editors Jim Milliot and Michael Coffey. On September 22, 2011, PW began a series of weekly podcasts: \\"Beyond the Book: PW's Week Ahead\\". Archives PW maintains an online archive of past book reviews from January 1991 to the present. The earliest articles posted in PW's online archive date back to November 1995. A redesigned website was unveiled on May 10, 2010.

He served for 51 years as a liberal rightist parliamentary deputy, and as a senator from 1921.

In June 1916 he was a relatively undistinguished center-right politician and one of the oldest members of the Italian parliament, when he was appointed Prime Minister, following the collapse of the Salandra government as a result of military defeats. His government fell in October 1917 as a result of the Italian military defeat in the Battle of Caporetto. During Boselli's time as prime minister, a decree of August 1917 extended the principle of compulsory insurance against accidents to agricultural workers generally.

It was founded in 1881. History Bethany College at the turn of the twentieth century Bethany College, established by Swedish Lutheran immigrants in 1881, is a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Swedish-Lutheran settlers worked with the Rev. Dr. Carl Aaron Swensson, Bethany‚Äôs founder, to establish Bethany Academy on October 15, 1881, in the sacristy of Bethany Lutheran Church in Lindsborg, Kansas, with ten students. Growing rapidly, Bethany evolved from Academy through 1885, to Bethany Normal Institute in 1887, to Bethany College in 1889. Notable Bethany presidents in the 20th century include Rev. Dr. Ernst Frederick Wilhelm Pihlblad (1873‚Äì1943), who was a professor from 1895 to 1904, and president from 1905 to 1941. Under Pihlblad, Bethany was accredited and became a member of the National Association of Schools of Music. Under the watch of Emory K. Lindquist (1908‚Äì1992), who took office of president in 1943, Bethany survived war troubles, grew in post-war America and improved its reputation. He was the author of Bethany in Kansas: The History of a College (1975). The Bethany College Board of Directors announced the appointment of William Jones as Bethany College President on May 13, 2016. Academics Bethany College has 14 academic departments. The school offers majors focused in education, humanities, fine arts, sciences, and social sciences; minors ranging from business and sacred music to theater and art; teaching endorsements for all majors in education; and six pre-professional studies including medicine, law and, physical therapy. Athletics Bethany College's athletic teams are known as the Terrible Swedes or Swedes. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and competes in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball. Traditions Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas *Since 1903, students and alumni have rallied Bethany athletic competition with the ‚ÄúRockar! Stockar!‚Äù cheer. *Every year since 1882, Bethany Oratorio Society has presented Handel's Messiah at the college, one of the longest-running annual performances in North America. *The walk from Bethany Lutheran Church. In honor of its founding in the sacristy of Bethany Lutheran Church, students traditionally walk to the church for a welcome service on their first day at Bethany as freshmen. Then, before the baccalaureate services on the day of their commencement, Bethany seniors line up in front of Bethany Lutheran Church for a traditional procession to Presser Hall on campus. *The ringing of the bell. When a Swedes athletics team wins conference, they gather in front of Hahn Gymnasium to ring the bell and spread the news to the rest of the campus, regardless of what time of day-or night-it may be. *Lift High the Cross. Each year during Homecoming week, Bethany students celebrate the college‚Äôs heritage of faith by lifting high a wooden cross in the gazebo. Students sign up for shifts so that the cross is held high during every hour of the week. *352.

Early life and political career Born in Troia (Province of Foggia, Apulia), he graduated from the University of Naples in 1875 and then became instructor and later professor of administrative law at the University of Rome. He was Minister of Agriculture (1899‚Äì1900) in the conservative government of Luigi Pelloux and subsequently Minister of the Treasury (1906) and Italian Minister of Finance (1909‚Äì1910) in the governments of Sidney Sonnino. Salandra, Antonio, Enciclopedia Treccani Prime Minister In March 1914, the conservative Salandra was brought into the national cabinet upon the fall of the government of Giovanni Giolitti, as the choice of Giolitti himself, who still commanded the support of most Italian parliamentarians. Salandra's government was the most conservative one that Italy had seen for a long time.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, p. 217 Salandra soon fell out with Giolitti over the question of Italian participation in World War I. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Salandra declared that Italy would not commit its troops, maintaining that the Triple Alliance had only a defensive stance and Austria-Hungary had been the aggressor. In reality, both Salandra and his ministers of Foreign Affairs, Antonino Patern√≤ Castello, who was succeeded by Sidney Sonnino in November 1914, began to probe which side would grant the best reward for Italy's entrance in the war and to fulfil Italy‚Äôs irrendentist claims.Baker, Ray Stannard (1923). Woodrow Wilson and World Settlement, Volume I, Doubleday, Page and Company, pp. 52‚Äì55 Entering World War I Salandra and ambassador Tommaso Tittoni at a conference of the Allied Powers on 27‚Äì28 March 1916 in Paris Salandra used the term \\"sacred egoism\\" (sacro egoismo) to define Italy's outlook on which side Italy would enter the war. Expecting the war would be short ‚Äì over by the late summer of 1915 ‚Äì there was some pressure on the decision to make.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, p. 219 Negotiations had been started between Sonnino, the British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey and the French Foreign Minister Jules Cambon. The secret pact, the Treaty of London or London Pact (), was signed between the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and the Russian Empire) and the Kingdom of Italy. According to the pact, Italy was to leave the Triple Alliance and join the Triple Entente. Italy was to declare war against Germany and Austria-Hungary within a month in return for territorial concessions at the end of the war. While Giolitti supported neutrality, Salandra and Sonnino, supported intervention on the side of the Allies, and secured Italy's entrance into the war despite the opposition of the majority in parliament. On 3 May 1915, Italy officially revoked the Triple Alliance. In the following days Giolitti and the neutralist majority of the Parliament opposed declaring war, while nationalist crowds demonstrated in public areas for entering the war. On 13 May 1915, Salandra offered his resignation, but Giolitti, fearful of nationalist disorder that might break into open rebellion, declined to succeed him as prime minister and Salandra's resignation was not accepted.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, p. 221-22 On 23 May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Salandra had expected that Italy's entrance on the allied side would bring the war to a quick solution, but in fact it changed little, and Italy's first year in the war was marked by only very limited success. Following the success of an Austrian offensive from the Trentino in the spring of 1916, Salandra was forced to resign. After World War I, Salandra moved further to the right, and supported Mussolini's accession to power in 1922. Nine years later he died in Rome. He was awarded Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star.

In 1809, Itsarasunthon succeeded his father Rama I, the founder of Chakri dynasty, as Loetlanaphalai the King of Siam. His reign was largely peaceful, devoid of major conflicts. His reign was known as the \\"Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature\\" as Loetlanaphalai was patron to a number of poets in his court and the King himself was a renowned poet and artist. The most notable poet in his employ was the illustrious Sunthorn Phu, the author of Phra Aphai Mani. Early life Privy seal of King Loetlanaphalai, \\"a garuda hold the nƒÅgas\\" (Wat Arun, Bangkok) Chim was born in 1767 during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in Amphawa District, Samut Songkram. Chim was a son of Luang Yokkrabat of Ratchaburi and Nak of Samut Sakorn, as his father and mother was then known. They would later become King Rama I and Queen Amarindra, respectively. In 1767, Ayutthaya fell to Konbaung Burmese invaders. His father, Phraya Ratchaburi, joined Taksin's forces to recapture the city. Under King Taksin, Chim's father rose rapidly to high rank as a military leader and was assigned with the campaigns to subjugate Laos and Cambodia. In 1782, his father crowned himself King of Siam (later named Rama I) and Chim himself was raised to the title of Prince Itsarasunthon of Siam. Loetlanaphalai, with his concubine Sri Sulalai, fathered Prince Tub ( - later Rama III) in 1787. Prince Itsarasunthon then had a secret affair with his own cousin, Princess Bunrod. In 1801, Rama I then found out that Princess Bunrod had been pregnant for four months and banished her out of the palace to live with her brother. Itsarasunthon, however begged his father to forgive him and the princess was reinstated and became his consort through the negotiation by concubine Khamwaen. Unfortunately, the baby died just after its birth. With Princess Bunrod, Loetlanaphalai also fathered Mongkut (1804) and Pinklao (1808). Prince Itsarasunthon was appointed to the Front Palace as Lord of the Front Palace or Uparaja in 1807 to succeed his uncle Maha Sura Singhanat who had died in 1803, though he continued to stay at the Thonburi Palace. Among his many other children was Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid, who was a royal physician for many years as well as a field commander and diplomat.Harper, Tim, Amrith, Sunil G. \\"Histories of Health in Southeast Asia\\" pp. 23-26 Ascension As the eldest surviving legitimate son of Rama I, Prince Itsarasunthon succeeded to throne when Buddha Yotfa Chulaloke died in 1809. No royal naming system was established at the time Rama II was crowned. He was later named by his son Nangklao as Loetlasulalai but changed to Loetlanaphalai by his another son Mongkut and by the Rama convention, called Rama II. His consort, Princess Bunrod, was raised to Queen Sri Suriyendra. As soon as Loetlanaphalai ascended the throne, Prince Kshatranichit, the surviving son of Taksin, rebelled as pretender to the throne. Loetlanaphalai's son, Prince Tub effectively crushed the rebellion, proving himself to be competent, thus gaining his father's favor. Prince Tub was raised to Kromma Muen, given the Sanskrit-derived name Jessadabodindra, and made Minister of Foreign Affairs.) =Counter the Burmese invasions= The Konbaung king Bodawpaya, seeing that Rama I was dead, marched an army into Chumphon and conquered Thalang (Phuket City) in the same year. Loetlanaphalai sent his brother Maha Senanurak the Front Palace to recapture Thalang, which had been razed to the ground. This \\"Thalang campaign\\" was the last invasion by the Burmese into Thai territory. Culture and literature View of the city of Bangkok in 1822. It was said that during Rama II's reign, if one could write a refined piece of poetry, then one would be able to become a royal favorite, as Loetlanaphalai himself was a poet. The reign was a cultural renaissance after the massive wars that plague the First Reign; particularly in the fields of arts and literature. Poets employed by Rama II included Sunthorn Phu the drunken writer (Phra Aphai Mani) and Narin Dhibet (Nirat Narin). His sons, Jessadabodindra and Paramanuchitchinorot, were encouraged to excel in poetry. Poramanuchit later became a Sangharaj (Buddhist hierophant) and was well known for his religious works. Rama II's reign saw the reconstruction of Thai culture and royal traditions. In 1811, the grand royal funeral was held for King Rama I. In the same year, a cholera epidemic broke out in Bangkok. Loetlanaphalai ordered Apat Pinat or sickness-repelling ceremonies to be performed. He also established the education and the examination system of Buddhism by dividing it into nine levels. In 1817, the Vesak festival was restored. Foreign relations In 1810, the first Rattanakosin-to-China mission was sent to the Jiaqing Emperor. Since the Siamese revolution of 1688, Western presence had been reduced to a small scale as the Thai Kings ceased to encourage foreign influence. This, coupled with the Napoleonic Wars, meant there was little contact between Thailand and foreigners. However, the wars caused many subsequent changes, which were observed in Southeast Asia. The British interest in Malaya increased as their trade with China increased. The Sultan of Kedah, a Siamese vassal, gave Penang off to the British without consulting Siam in 1786, followed by the British acquisition of Seberang Perai. Soon the British replaced the Dutch as the dominating naval power south of Siam. The mission of the Portuguese governor of Macau in 1818 was the first formal Western contact in Siam since the Ayutthaya times. The British founded Singapore in 1819 and Jaslis, a missionary from Yangon, introduced the printing press in the same year. The Portuguese established the first western consulate in 1820. The first renewed formal British visit was made by John Crawfurd in 1822. Death and succession Statue of King Rama II at Wat Arun In July 1824, he died \\"very suddenly\\". It was said to be caused by strangury, but rumours were not without strong suspicions of his being poisoned. According to the succession rule then theoretically in force, the throne would go to the son of Queen Sri Suriyendra, Prince Mongkut; however, his elder half-brother Jessadabodindra succeeded the same day. Though only the son of a concubine, he had served their father in putting down a revolt and then as Kromma Tha (Ministry of Trade and Foreign Relations.) The elder brother's experience counted for more than the theoretical claim of the much younger and inexperienced brother, who nevertheless did succeed his elder brother much later, and sired many sons but raised none of their mothers to the rank of queen, thus technically none of his sons had claim to the throne over their half-uncle whose mother was a Rama II's principal consort.

It featured footage from WWE's vast archive of wrestling footage, including classic WWE, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and more. It offered around 40 hours of rotating programming per month, arranged into four (previously six) \\"programming buckets\\", often centered on a specific theme. It was originally called WWE 24/7 On Demand. In September 2008, it was changed to WWE 24/7 Classics on Demand. In April 2009, it was changed again to WWE Classics On Demand. WWE Classics was presented only on digital cable. Among the services carrying it were Comcast, AT&T; U-Verse (discontinued in 2012), Verizon FiOS, Mediacom, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Rogers Cable, EastLink, Seaside Communications, Cogeco, Armstrong, Cablevision, Sky Italia and not long ago, Astro. Some of its programming was packaged as Madison Square Garden Classics and began airing on MSG Network in the summer of 2006. In November 2007, the service had around 115,000 subscribers. The service closed on January 31, 2014 to make way for their new video-streaming and subscription service WWE Network. Programming buckets and programs  The programming buckets and the programs which usually or occasionally appear on them: * WWE Legends-focuses on \\"narrative, retrospective and thematic programs\\" dealing with \\"legendary\\" wrestlers. ** Hall of Fame-\\"Mean Gene\\" Okerlund hosts an original profile of a specific WWE Hall of Famer. *** Throughout the rest of the month a selection of matches featuring that star are featured, changing every two weeks. ** WWE Old School - Archival house shows from the 1970s to the 1990s. These shows mostly took place in New York, Boston, Toronto, and Philadelphia. ** Legends of Wrestling-A round table discussion. An occasional program. ** The Film Room with Gordon Solie-Jim Ross introduces classic footage documenting the career of a specific wrestler or tracing a specific event/feud as called by and featuring interviews with Gordon Solie. An occasional program. ** This section also contains DVD and video releases. * The Big Events ** Vintage pay-per-views and \\"super show\\" events from WWF/WWE, WCW, NWA, and AWA. These events could be a few months to years old. ** WWE U-Choose (formerly Pick Your Big One) - Every month three \\"Big One\\" events, based on the next months theme, are offered up to be voted on at WWE's Classics subsite, with the winning event offered for viewing amongst the next months \\"Big Ones\\" selections. ** Usually, a WWE pay-per-view that aired about a few months prior will be shown. This is shown in its entirety, but had also been broken down match by match as an additional option. * TV Classics-The history of professional wrestling is shown through re-airings of wrestling television shows. ** Extreme Championship Wrestling - Hosted by Joey Styles, Tazz was the original host of the show until he left WWE in April 2009.

It airs as one program like the \\"original\\" show did. When this show debuted, Michael Cole was seen sitting behind the RAW announce position inside an empty arena explaining the programming change. This lasted a few episodes until the show began airing without the interlude. ** Additional programming, sometimes but not always, related to the months theme, is also put into this section. * Shorties ** Matches and/or memorable moments centered on the month's theme are hosted by a particular superstar (e.g. moments or matches involving food for Thanksgiving).  Previous buckets  WWE 24/7 logo used until April 2009. When the service debuted it did so with six, more specialized, buckets. Around April 4, 2007 they were combined and pruned into a more broad set of four. This was done, according to the free \\"Month Preview\\" show hosted by Jack Korpela to make things easier for Classics viewers. The original six buckets and their programming were: * Hall of Fame - Featuring only the Okerlund hosted biography and matches of a particular Hall of Famer. * Big Ones - Past pay-per-views * Specials - Home video releases and network specials * ECW - The History of ECW show (then hosted by Tazz alone) * Prime Time - Any past wrestling programming that would have originally aired in or around \\"prime time,\\" including Monday Night Wars, which aired as one program. * Old School - Recorded house shows Over time the \\"ECW\\" bucket was expanded to \\"Territories - ECW\\" and began to incorporate shows from the \\"territorial days\\" of the business. Later still the name was changed to its current \\"TV Classics\\" when it started housing the programming found in the \\"Prime Time\\" bucket, which was removed altogether. The \\"Old School\\" and \\"Big Ones\\" buckets were combined, keeping the \\"Big Ones\\" name, and becoming a bucket for any and all larger shows. \\"Hall of Fame\\" was renamed to the less restrictive \\"WWE Legends\\" and began to house material from the \\"Specials\\" bucket, which was also removed.  Legends of Wrestling  Legends of Wrestling is an original series made specifically for the Classics service. The program features various \\"legends\\" of the business, for their work in and out of the ring, having a roundtable discussion about specific topics, persons, or occurrences in the history of wrestling. The show was originally hosted by WWE commentator Jim Ross‚Äìwith former interviewer Gene Okerlund filling in for him on a few occasions‚Äìuntil Okerlund took over hosting duties completely with the shows fourth panel. The series was divided into unofficial \\"seasons\\" of hour-long episodes (each with a short intermission) featuring the same panels. In January 2009, a DVD box set of three episodes: Sgt. Slaughter/Ric Flair, Jerry Lawler/the Junkyard Dog, and \\"Heatseekers\\"‚Äîabout wrestlers who have a reputation of \\"causing trouble\\" backstage‚Äîalong with bonus matches involving the stars. Best Buy exclusives episodes Bob Backlund/Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik/Andr√© the Giant, and \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper/Terry Funk were also released. The episodes come from the first season, with the exception of \\"Heatseekers\\", which is a second- season episode.  Extra material  * Before some selections begin there are short \\"promos\\" and clips shown featuring either memorable moments in the history of wrestling or a selection of highlights of a particular superstar before that star announces \\"You're watching WWE 24/7\\". * Early in the service's existence, it included an on-screen crawl during some content detailing historical moments‚Äîtitle changes, important matches, birthdays‚Äîin the history of wrestling for the month. The crawl was later changed to only featuring title changes. * Other times a lower third will appear on screen to provide supplemental information to what's going on on screen. Often it is tied into the month's theme. * On Monday Night Wars, an occasional segment called \\"War Stories\\" follows a key moment in the Monday Night War, where stars involved in the moment discuss the immediate reactions to the segment, but can also give insights into why a particular segment happened.  WWE Video Library  The WWE Video Library is the largest professional wrestling tape library anywhere in the world, with well over 100,000 hours of content. It not only consists of World Wrestling Entertainment footage (dating back to 1970), but WWE has aggressively purchased regional and national competitors, through time amassing a gargantuan library of television programs, pay-per-view recordings, video productions, and recordings of wrestling matches dating back to the 1950s and representing a very significant portion of the visual history of modern professional wrestling and sports entertainment.  Editing  Since World Wrestling Entertainment is no longer allowed to use the \\"WWF\\" initialism or their 1998-2002 logo except for \\"specified circumstances\\", instances of both were edited and/or removed from pertinent programming. In late July 2012, WWE reached a settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature which once again allows them to use the \\"WWF\\" initials and scratch logo on archive footage. Unedited footage first appeared on the 1000th episode of Monday Night Raw and since then has appeared in full length matches shown on the WWE website and on Classics on Demand. In addition, previously licensed music to which the rights have expired are removed or replaced with alternate songs. Additionally, some formerly live events are censored for language and/or nudity. Ring announcer Michael Buffer is also edited out of any programming due to his trademarked phrase, \\"Let's Get Ready to Rumble\\". In the wake of the Chris Benoit double murder-suicide a number of wrestling websites reported that the likeness of and references to both Chris and Nancy Benoit were being removed from pertinent programming. Eventually Nancy's image was allowed to return to programming, though over six years later Benoit's continued to be excised. Most notably both his wrestling and mention of his name was removed from episodes of Monday Night Wars airings of WCW Monday Nitro, as well as match segments from other shows, though he is occasionally mentioned and shown in brief non-wrestling roles. His image eventually returned in a wrestling role during a rebroadcast of World War 3 from 1997. In early January 2014, WWE issued a memo stating that footage involving Chris Benoit would air on the WWE Network with the following advisory: \\"The following program is presented in its original form. It may contain some content that does not reflect WWE's corporate views and may not be suitable for all viewers. WWE characters are fictitious and do not reflect the personal lives of the actors portraying them.

Amid huge publicity for price cuts on over 500 items, customers took their sleeping bags to await the opening of the store and claim their hamper, champagne and flowers. This was the company's foray into direct competition with Sainsbury. =Market share= Wm Low was one of the market leaders in Scotland in terms of market share, which was 7.4% in 1981, rising to 10.4% in 1984 and then 12.7% in 1986. It then started to fall until the 1994 takeover by Tesco. History of the takeover =Competing bids= The takeover battle for William Low started on 14 July 1994, when Tesco announced its formal bid of ¬£156 million for the company to dramatically improve its Scottish portfolio and an assurance it would not cherry pick the best stores. J Sainsbury launched a counter-bid of ¬£210 million but this would have led to a break up of the Wm Low portfolio as they had intended to maintain the best stores and dispose of the rest. The Scottish market leader at the time, The Argyll Group - Safeway - announced in July 1994 that it would not be making a bid for Wm Low.Grocer Magazine, July 1994 Sainsbury was keen to gain a stronger foothold in Scotland, having only 3 stores in Scotland at the time of the bid. Tesco reacted with an improved offer of ¬£247 million and Sainsbury's withdrew from the battle. Tesco formally took over Wm Low on 2 September 1994 for a total sum of ¬£257 million. Analysis at the time suggested that the Sainsbury bid was possibly a spoiler tactic as opposed to a serious takeover attempt.BBC TV, Reporting Scotland, evening editions, transmitted 1994-07-14 and 3 August 1994. The company had been independent for 126 years, having been founded in 1868. The purchase of Wm Low doubled Tesco's Scottish market share from 7.6% to 15.3% in 1995.

Although the vast majority of old Wm Low stores have now been replaced with all-new Tesco stores, some branches retain some Wm Low format fixtures (e.g. open grid false ceilings and blue / pink tiling in toilets). This is evident in stores such as Inverness Metro, Campbeltown, Fort Willam, Helensburgh, St Andrews, Dalgety Bay, Rosyth, Monifeith, Kilmarnock and Haddington. This is despite the stores having undergone a couple of internal refits since the takeover. Tesco Banff is the last obvious Wm Low style store left in the portfolio, having not undergone any refit since immediately after the takeover in 1996. This store is due to be replaced by a new purpose built store in 2010. In 2014 Tesco scrapped plans to replace the Banff store along with other projects due to a huge loss in profits. Dundee Lochee which was the last large Wm Low superstore closed on 7 February 2009, being replaced by Dundee South Rd, which is spread out over 3 floors. Wishaw Tesco moved to a purpose built store in November 2007 across from its original Wm Low store. =Remaining stores= Most of the remaining Wm Low stores have been converted to the Tesco \\"Metro\\" format, in line with their smaller size. Such stores can be found in Grangemouth, St Andrews, Campbeltown, Monifieth, Inverness, Fort William, Helensburgh and Stranraer. =Planned Wm Low store expansion= At the time of the Tesco take over, a number of new Wm Low Stores were earmarked for development. These were ultimately launched as Tescos but had been planned by Wm Low. This included Aviemore,JLP Development Consultancy Article retrieved 26 November 2007. Cupar, Falkirk and Dunblane, opened between 1995 and 1996. =Redundant stores= Some of the now redundant sites have gone on to find new owners after Tesco relocated in nearby areas. The former Wm Low stores in Dalkeith and Dingwall have now become branches of Lidl, Wm Low Blairgowrie became M&Co;, whilst Wm Low Elgin became TK Maxx. Wm Low Keith became The Original Factory Shop, Wm Low Forres remained empty until it was demolished in 2014. Wm Low Bathgate West Lothian became Tesco which relocated to a new purpose built store on the outskirts of Blackburn, West Lothian, the former Wm Low unit then became B Wise and Qs which both have since closed down. The site is currently as of December 2013, a fairly large charity shop. Wm Low Dundee Lochee has now become The Range after Tesco relocated to Dundee South Road. Wm Low in Perth (Victoria St branch) lay empty for almost a decade before half of the premises was refitted and operated as a Matalan Store and the other half (what used to be the supermarket warehouse) a store selling floor coverings and living-room furniture. As of July 2020, Matalan now occupies the entire building. In 2007, the former Wm Low store in Forfar closed, with Tesco moving to a new site at the northern end of the town centre. The old site was subsequently sold to Focus DIY, whose store opened there in early 2008. The site has a garden centre, built on part of the old car park, and very little exists to suggest it was a former supermarket. As of 2016 the store is a now a branch of Home Bargains which now occupies the entire floor space and has re- opened the garden centre. The former Wm Low store in Goole, East Yorkshire, was taken over by Tesco, but this was relocated to a larger site on Boothferry Road in the late 1990s. The store was split into four units and is now home to a branch of Home Bargains and Farmfoods with the other two units being empty. The store in Berwick-upon-Tweed became a Kwik Save, which in turn has closed and stood empty for years. It has now been demolished (2016) and controversial offices have been built on the site The store in Consett (County Durham) was converted into Tesco, then Tesco relocated in the town to a larger store and the store now trades as B&M; Home Store =Distribution centres= The Wm Low warehouse in Gateshead was closed in March 1995. The head office and Distribution Centre at the Dryburgh Estate in Dundee became the Tesco Customer Service Centre and one of two Scottish Distribution Depots for Tesco. Wm Low Dryburgh Distribution Centre was built in the mid 1970s by Wm Low with an expected 25 years life span. In 2006, Tesco announced the closure of the Dundee depot to create a brand new centre in Livingston on the site of the former NEC which would also replace the current distribution centre already based in Livingston (now open as of October 2007). The customer service centre is unaffected by the closure. Residents of Dundee reacted furiously to the news of the depot closure. The warehouse at Dundee was demolished in 2019.

During the incident, at least 43 Germans were killed (confirmed body count) but the estimated numbers range from 80 to thousands of victims. Intelligence officer and police commandant Bed≈ôich Pokorn√Ω, who previously took part in the organisation of so called Brno death march in May 1945, has been sometimes accused of organizing this massacre towards the end of the Potsdam conference (17 July to 2 August 1945) after the government had halted such acts. On 31 July 2005, the mayor of √öst√≠ unveiled a memorial plaque on the bridge with the text \\"In the memory of victims of violence on 31 July 1945\\" (photographs). Cause and conflict On July 31, at 15:30, an ammunition dump in the part of the city called Kr√°sn√© B≈ôezno exploded. The death toll was 26 or 27 people (7 of them Czechs), dozens were injured. Immediately after the explosion, a massacre of ethnic Germans, who had to wear white armbands after the war and so were easy to identify, began in four places in the city. They were beaten and bayonetted, shot or drowned in a fire pond. On the Elbe bridge, a German, Georg Sch√∂rghuber, shouted something provocative and was thrown into the river by the crowd, and shot by soldiers when he was trying to swim out. Soon other people, including a woman with a baby and pram, were thrown into the water and later shot at. The perpetrators were the Revolutionary Guards (a post-war paramilitary group), Czech and Soviet soldiers, and a group of unknown Czechs who had recently arrived from elsewhere. Local Czechs, including the mayor, Josef Vondra, tried to help the victims. Finally, a state of emergency and a curfew were declared, and by 18:25, streets had been cleared by the army. Count of victims The estimated number of victims is 80‚Äì120, with 43 being accounted for specifically: 24 bodies gathered in the city were burned in the crematorium of the former concentration camp in Terez√≠n on 1 August; a list was made of the 17 missing clerks from the Schicht factory, who were returning from work by way of the bridge at the time of the explosion; and two are mentioned in other sources. In Germany, several dozen bodies were recovered from the Elbe river in the following weeks; however, these could have come from elsewhere. The Sudeten Germans organisations give much higher numbers - from 400 up to 8,000. Subsequent effects The next day, 1 August, the government of Czechoslovakia established an investigation commission led by General Ludv√≠k Svoboda. The commission was not able to discover the reason for the explosion but blamed it on the Werewolves (German saboteurs). The explosion and subsequent massacre were used as a pretext by advocates of the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. During the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia (1948‚Äì1989) details of the event were suppressed, to the point of it being almost unknown to most Czechs. Suspected communist involvement After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, city archivist Vladim√≠r Kaiser started to investigate the event, most recently publishing the results together with Jan Havel, another √öst√≠ citizen, and German historian Otfrid Pustejovsky as Stalo se v √öst√≠ nad Labem 31. ƒçervence 1945 (√öst√≠ nad Labem 2005, ; German translation Ein Nachkriegs-Verbrechen: Aussig 31. Juli 1945; ). While only indirect evidence survived, they conclude that the explosion and massacre were prepared by Communists within the Czechoslovak secret services, specifically Bed≈ôich Pokorn√Ω, leader of Ministry of Interior's Defensive Intelligence (Obrann√© zpravodajstv√≠) department who earlier organised the Brno death march, in order to support the transfer of Germans from Czechoslovakia by presenting to the Potsdam Conference an argument that further cohabitation of Germans with Czechs was impossible. (Kaiser's 2000 hypothesis that the motive was the Western powers' interest in destroying the new Daimler-Benz DB 605 airplane engines also stored in the dump was found far-fetched and untenable.)

It is notable for using VHS tapes rather than ROM cartridges, prompting the creation of game content which survived on into much more advanced CD-ROM platforms.  History  Originally codenamed \\"NEMO\\", initial development began in 1985 and was supported by Nolan Bushnell's company Axlon. The team, which included Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak, created a prototype using a modified ColecoVision console to combine interactive images with a video stream transmitted through a cable. As a storage medium, NEMO employs VHS tapes that contain computer data alongside a grid of multiple tracks of video and audio that can be toggled. To take the project beyond prototype status, they searched for a partner who would fund further development. The Hasbro toy company agreed to invest $7 million in exchange for the video game rights to the technology. Three short trial games were finished by the middle of 1986: Scene of the Crime, a four-minute interactive mystery; Bottom of the Ninth Inning, a baseball game; and an interactive music video for the song \\"You Might Think\\" by The Cars. The next step was the interactive movie Night Trap, inspired by Scene of the Crime, and filmed in December 1986 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the hometown of Hasbro. In 1987, Zito created the second full-size game named Sewer Shark, in one month's filming time and at a cost of $3 million. After filming for Sewer Shark was completed, and two months prior to the 1989 release, Hasbro abandoned the project because the projected price was deemed uncompetitive against the well established and much cheaper Nintendo Entertainment System. Zito purchased the rights to the games and stored everything in a Rhode Island warehouse.  Legacy  It wasn't until the early 1990s that the CD-ROM became an affordable mass storage medium for video game consoles, enabling full motion video (FMV) games at home. Sega was looking for content for the 1992 introduction of the Sega CD accessory for the Genesis console. They contacted Zito, who created versions of Sewer Shark and Night Trap for Sega CD through his Digital Pictures company. Ports to other systems would soon follow. Footage of a presentation of a NEMO prototype to Hasbro executives can be found in the Sega CD version of Night Trap when entering a cheat code. Lawrence H. Bernstein, working for Milton Bradley Company at that time, plays Scene of the Crime, the prototype of Night Trap. A playable version of Scene of the Crime can be found in Night Trap: 25th Anniversary Edition.

By moving their cilia rapidly, a water eddy is created. In this way they control the direction of their movement. Additionally, in this way they bring their food closer, in order to capture it more easily.  Occurrence  Trochophores exist as a larval form within the trochozoan clade, which include the entoprocts, molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans. Together, these phyla make up part of the Lophotrochozoa; it is possible that trochophore larvae were present in the life cycle of the group's common ancestor.  Etymology  The term trochophore derives from the ancient Greek (), meaning \\"wheel\\", and () ‚Äî or () ‚Äî, meaning 'to bear, to carry', because the larva is bearing a wheel-shaped band of cilia.

The band took its name from Nora Diniro, a character from the film Pump Up the Volume. Central New Jersey hardcore band Nora began as a group of friends in 1996. After releasing the Kill You For A Dollar EP and a split CDEP with the Dillinger Escape Plan through Ferret Records, the band moved over to Trustkill Records in 1999 and issued another EP, called Neverendingyouline. Following this EP, Mike Olender and John Kohler left to pursue Burnt By The Sun and Ex Number Five, and the band moved forward with Matt \\"Portland\\" Hay and Matt \\"Frenchie\\" Haick filling the guitar spots. The band released their first album, Losers' Intuition in 2001. Following the departure of Matt Haick, who left to pursue his other project Merciana, and original bassist Spliedt during 2002, the lineup of Severson, Hay (guitar), Ross (drums) welcomed new bassist Tim Cuccolo (ex-Ex Number Five) and Chris Byrnes (guitar) and released Dreamers & Deadmen in 2003. Cuccolo later left and with Byrnes moving over to bass, second guitarist Steve \\"Steve Jeff\\" Chladnicek joined on in early 2004. The following year, Byrnes exited to go join Every Time I Die, and former Nora guitarist/Burnt by the Sun vocalist Mike Olender came back in his place. Nora entered the studio in early 2007 to record and release Save Yourself, and went dormant soon after until 2015. Vocalist Carl Severson was owner of hardcore record label Ferret Music but has since moved on to start Good Fight Entertainment since the Warner Bros buy out of Ferret.

The character serves as the main antagonist of Mother and its sequel, EarthBound. He invades Earth in an attempt to wipe out humanity in Mother, and returns in EarthBound where he conquers the world and sends his forces into the past to ensure that protagonist Ness could not defeat him. The battle against Giygas, which depicts him in turmoil, drew inspiration from a Japanese film which traumatized Itoi as a child. He has received positive reception with critics referring to his battle as one of the creepiest and most difficult in video games, and considered one of the greatest and most iconic video game antagonists of all time. He has been the subject of analysis and speculation, with an urban legend being spread about the final battle with him in EarthBound being a representation of an abortion, which staff denied. Concept and creation Giygas was designed and written by the creator of the EarthBound series, Shigesato Itoi, and debuted in the original Mother. He is known as Gyiyg in Japanese and Giegue in the canceled English localization. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas in EarthBound resulted from a traumatic childhood event where he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a Shintoho film entitled Kenpei to barabara shibijin. The film featured a murder scene near a river that Itoi mistook for a rape scene which affected him so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas' dialogue for the final battle. Itoi described Giygas as something that people cannot make sense of, but also as a living being who deserves love. He described the film scene as a combination of atrocity and eroticism, and that is what his lines are in the end. While designing this battle, Itoi spoke all of the text out loud while another staff member, Matchan Miura, wrote it down. He spoke each hiragana character one by one because he found it scarier. There has been a misunderstanding regarding the influence of the film on Giygas, with some believing that imagery, dialogue, or audio from that film were used here, when the only thing Itoi took from it was the ability to \\"manipulate an audience's emotional state.\\" Music composer Hirokazu Tanaka described Giygas as the \\"embodiment of evil\\". As a result, he composed the music in a certain way based on the player's proximity to him. For example, in battles where Ness and company encounter someone or something under Giygas' control, the music and sound effects reflect this. Before the release of EarthBound, the localization team had at one point considered localizing Giygas as his original name Giegue or Geek.\\" It was speculated that the change from Giegue to Giygas was due to a change in localization staff. An urban legend exists that suggests that the final battle with Giygas in EarthBound was an \\"alien abortion.\\" Marcus Lindblom, a member of the English localization team, acknowledged the urban legend, noting that he appreciated the speculation, but debunked the idea as an official interpretation. Appearances Giygas appears in the Family Computer video game, Mother. Giygas was raised by Maria, a woman abducted along with her husband George by Giygas' alien race from Earth in the early 1900s. George studied the aliens' PSI powers without permission and escaped back to Earth. Once he matured, Giygas was tasked by his people to make sure that PSI never spread onto Earth. However, Giygas did not want to betray those who raised him, particularly Maria. In the end, he forced himself to detach from Maria and began preparations for the aliens' invasion. Eighty years later, strange things start happening on Earth. These events are eventually revealed to be the work of Giygas. Maria, now a Queen in a magical world called Magicant, explains everything to the protagonists of Mother after her memories are restored. When the protagonists encounter Giygas, he explains his motives to them while attacking them with his PSI power. Maria urges protagonist Ninten to sing her Eight Melodies, which weakens Giygas. Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd sing together, forcing Giygas to surrender and flee. Giygas also appears in the Super NES sequel EarthBound. Giygas is an unseen villain for most of the story, although he possesses humans, animals, and objects who unknowingly do his bidding. According to a character from the future named Buzz Buzz, Giygas destroys the universe ten years in the future. One of his key minions is Pokey Minch, a former friend of protagonist Ness. At first, Dr. Andonuts (the father of playable character Jeff) believes that Giygas is residing deep within the Earth, and transports himself and the party there using a machine called the Phase Distorter. When they arrive, they find that Giygas is attacking from that exact location, but from innumerable years in the past. The only way the protagonists can get to Giygas' time period is to alter the Phase Distorter to transport them back in time. When the group finally reaches Giygas, he initially resembles Ness while in the device called the \\"Devil's Machine.\\" Pokey eventually turns the Devil's Machine off, thereby destroying Giygas' body and mind by releasing his power and driving him mad. At this point, Giygas' words are nondescript and nonsensical. Giygas is eventually destroyed by Paula, who prays to the protagonists' friends and family for help. Her praying eventually reaches the player, and the combined prayers do enough damage to Giygas, killing him. Reception Since appearing in EarthBound, Giygas has received largely positive reception. His role and design was regarded as contrasting with the otherwise lighthearted tone of the rest of EarthBounds story by Brittany Vincent for G4TV. Cassandra Ramos for RPGamer identified him as one of her favorite villains, while 1UP.com staff listed the battle with Giygas as one of the 25 best boss battles, citing the audio and imagery of Giygas as well as the final portion of the battle. Jeremy Parish for 1UP.com used the battle as an example of how games subvert expectations, where the protagonists employ prayer instead of their most powerful attacks to win. IGN staff included the battle with Giygas in their list of the 10 most cinematic video game moments. NGamer UK staff listed Giygas as one of the most iconic boss encounters in Nintendo history, stating that the defining moment was his design and the method of defeating him. GamesRadar+ staff named him one of the best video game antagonists, finding him creepy and a more imposing villain than Kefka Palazzo from Final Fantasy VI. Staff for Complex, GameSpot, and UGO Networks listed the fight against Giygas as one of the hardest in video games, with the latter and Chloi Rad for IGN calling him one of the most frightening video game characters. He was featured in a GameSpot user-voted poll of the greatest villains in video games, where he lost in the first round to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic antagonist Darth Malak. Nadia Oxford for IGN listed the battle with Giygas as one of the most memorable moments in EarthBound and stated that its significance resonated with people who had not played the game, a sentiment that Cassandra Ramos of RPGamer shared. In a work for 1UP.com, Oxford claimed that Itoi took inspiration from Stephen King novels, including It. She suggested that Giygas was based on Its antagonist due to a similarly \\"borderline indescribable\\" form and the fact that they both succumb to \\"childlike qualities such as faith, friendship, and love.\\" She discusses how the battle with Giygas in Mother deviates from traditional final boss battles, citing his deep motivations and music employed, which consists of a \\"shrill background noise\\" and a lullaby. She suggested that Giygas' degraded form in EarthBound was possibly the result of Giygas' longing for Maria's love. Patricia Hernandez for Nightmare Mode discussed how his Mother incarnation \\"echoes a motif\\" of children without parental guidance doing poorly for it. Colin Snyder for Vice felt similarly, stating that his story is about the loss of childhood. William Hughes for The A.V. Club argued that Giygas had an oedipal complex due to his infatuation with his surrogate mother and hatred for his surrogate father over him stealing information from the aliens.

It was designed by NetApp for use in its storage appliances like NetApp FAS, AFF, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select. Its author claims that WAFL is not a file system, although it includes one. It tracks changes similarly to journaling file systems as logs (known as NVLOGs) in dedicated memory storage device non-volatile random access memory, referred to as NVRAM or NVMEM. WAFL provides mechanisms that enable a variety of file systems and technologies that want to access disk blocks. Design WAFL inode structure, metadata stored alongside data WAFL stores metadata, as well as data, in files; metadata, such as inodes and block maps indicating which blocks in the volume are allocated, are not stored in fixed locations in the file system. The top-level file in a volume is the inode file, which contains the inodes for all other files; the inode for the inode file itself, called the root inode, is stored in a block with a fixed location. An inode for a sufficiently small file contains the file's contents; otherwise, it contains a list of pointers to file data blocks or a list of pointers to indirect blocks containing lists of pointers to file data blocks, and so forth, with as many layers of indirect blocks as are necessary, forming a tree of blocks. All data and metadata blocks in the file system, other than the block containing the root inode, are stored in files in the file system. The root inode can thus be used to locate all of the blocks of all files other than the inode file. Main memory is used as a page cache for blocks from files. When a change is made to a block of a file, the copy in the page cache is updated and marked dirty, and the difference is logged in non-volatile memory in a log called the NVLOG. If the dirty block in the page cache is to be written to permanent storage, it is not rewritten to the block from which it was read; instead, a new block is allocated on permanent storage, the contents of the block are written to the new location, and the inode or indirect block that pointed to the block in question is updated in main memory. If the block containing the inode, or the indirect block, is to be written to permanent storage, it is also written to a new location, rather than being overwritten at its previous position. This is what the \\"Write Anywhere\\" in \\"Write Anywhere File Layout\\" refers to. As all blocks, other than the block containing the root inode, are found via the root inode, none of the changes written to permanent storage are visible on permanent storage until the root inode is updated. The root inode is updated by a process called a consistency point, in which all dirty blocks not yet written to permanent storage are written to permanent storage, and a new root inode is written out, pointing to the blocks in the new version of the inode file. At that point, all of the changes to the file system are visible on permanent storage, using the new root inode. The NVLOG entries for changes that are now visible are discarded to make room for log entries for subsequent changes. Consistency points are performed periodically or if the non-volatile memory is close to being full of log entries. If the server crashes before all changes to a file system have been made visible in a consistency point, the changes that have not been made visible are still in the NVLOG; when the server reboots, it replays all entries in the NVLOG, again making the changes recorded in the NVLOG, so that they will not be lost. Features As discussed above, WAFL does not store data or metadata in pre-determined locations on disk. Instead it automatically places data using temporal locality to write metadata alongside user data in a way designed to minimize the number of disk operations required to commit data to stable disk storage using single and dual parity based RAID. Using a data placement based on temporal locality of reference can improve the performance of reading datasets which are read in a similar way to the way they were written (e.g. a database record and its associated index entry), however it can also cause fragmentation from the perspective of spatial locality of reference. On spinning HDDs this does not adversely affect files that are sequentially written, randomly read, or are subsequently read using the same temporal pattern, but does affect sequential read after random write spatial data access patterns because of magnetic head could be only in one position at a time to read data from platter while fragmentation does no effect on SSD drives. Releases of ONTAP since 7.3.1 have included a number of techniques to optimize spatial data layout such as the reallocate command to perform scheduled and manual defragmentation, and the Write after Reading volume option which detects and automatically corrects suboptimal data access patterns caused by spatial fragmentation. Releases of ONTAP 8.1.1 include other techniques to automatically optimize contiguous free-space within the filesystem which also helps to maintain optimal data layouts for most data access patterns. Before 7G, the wafl scan reallocate command would need to be invoked from an advanced privilege level and could not be scheduled. Releases of ONTAP since 9.1 have included a number of techniques to optimize SSD usage such as Inline Data Compaction (in 9.1), starting with ONTAP 9.2 FabricPool functionality for automatic tiering of cold data to slow S3 storage and back if needed for SSD aggregates, and Cross Volume Deduplication within an aggregate with maximum of 800TiB for each aggregate. =Snapshots= Traditional Copy On Write technique data in place backup NetApp RoW Snapshot data in place backup WAFL supports snapshots, which are read-only copies of a file system. Snapshots are created by performing the same operations that are performed in a consistency point, but, instead of updating the root inode corresponding to the current state of the file system, saving a copy of the root inode. As all data and metadata in a file system can be found from the root inode, all data and metadata in a file system, as of the time when the snapshot is created, can be found from the snapshot's copy of the root inode. No other data needs to be copied to create a snapshot. Blocks are allocated when written using a block map, which keeps track of which blocks are in use and which blocks are free. An entry in the block map contains a bit indicating whether the block is in use in the current version of the file system and several bits, one per snapshot, indicating whether the block is in use in the snapshot. This ensures that data in a snapshot is not overwritten until the snapshot is deleted. Using block map all new writes and rewrites are written to new empty blocks, WAFL only reports that block rewrite successful, but no rewrites actually occur, this approach called Redirect-on-write (ROW) technique. ROW is much faster on rewrite operations compare to Copy-on-write where old data block going to be rewritten in-place and captured in a snapshot needs to be copied first to space allocated for snapshot reserve in order to preserve original data, this generates additional data copy operations once system get rewrites to that block. Snapshots provide online backups that can be accessed quickly, through special hidden directories in the file system, allowing users to recover files that have been accidentally deleted or modified. NetApp's Data ONTAP Release 7G operating system supports a read- write snapshot called FlexClone. Snapshots are basis for technologies like SnapMirror, SnapVault and Online Volume Move while features like FlexClone, SnapLock, SnapRestore are snapshot-like technologies leverage on WAFL capabilities and properties like manipulations with inodes. Starting with ONTAP 9.4 maximum number of snapshots supported for each FlexVol is 1024, while for previous versions max limit was 255. Starting with ONTAP 9.5 snapshot sharing functionality were added to run deduplication scan across Active file system and snapshots, and deduplication savings is a magnitude of number of snapshots. Before 9.5 not deduplicated data locked in a snapshot couldn‚Äôt be used by deduplication process and runs only in active file system. =File and directory model= An important feature of WAFL is its support for both a Unix-style file and directory model for NFS clients and a Microsoft Windows-style file and directory model for SMB clients. WAFL also supports both security models, including a mode where different files on the same volume can have different security attributes attached to them. Unix can use either access control lists (ACL) or a simple bitmask, whereas the more recent Windows model is based on access control lists. These two features make it possible to write a file to an SMB type of networked filesystem and access it later via NFS from a Unix workstation. Alongside ordinary files, WAFL can contain file-containers called LUNs with required special attributes like LUN serial number for block devices, which could be accessed using SAN protocols running on ONTAP OS software. =FlexVol= WAFL FlexVol Layout: blocks and inode metadata alongside user data Each Flexible Volume (FlexVol) is a separate WAFL file system, located on an aggregate and distributed across all disks in the aggregate. Each aggregate can contain and usually has multiple FlexVol volumes. ONTAP during data optimization process including the \\"Tetris\\" which finishes with Consistency Points (see NVRAM) is programmed to evenly distribute data blocks as much as possible in each FlexVol volume across all disks in aggregate so each FlexVol could potentially use all available performance of all the data disks in the aggregate. With the approach of even data block distribution across all the data disks in an aggregate, performance throttling for a FlexVol could be done dynamically with storage QoS and does not require dedicated aggregates or RAID groups for each FlexVol to guarantee performance and provide the unused performance to a FlexVol volume which requires it. Each FlexVol could be configured as thick or thin provisioned space and later could be changed on the fly any time. Block device access with storage area network] (SAN) protocols such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is done with LUN emulation similar to Loop device technique on top of a FlexVol volume; thus each LUN on WAFL file system appears as a file, yet have additional properties required for block devices. LUNs can also be configured as thick or thin provisioned and can be changed later on the fly. Due to WAFL architecture, FlexVols and LUNs can increase or decrease configured space usage on the fly. If a FlexVol contains data, internal space can be decreased no less than used space. Even though LUN size with data on it could be decreased on WAFL file system, ONTAP has no knowledge about upper-level block structure due to SAN architecture so it could truncate data and damage the file system on that LUN, so the host needs to migrate the blocks containing the data into a new LUN boundary to prevent data loss. Each FlexVol can have its own QoS, FlashPool, FlasCache or FabricPool policies. If two FlexVol volumes are created, each on two aggregates and those aggregates owned by two different controllers, and the system administrator needs to use space from these volumes through a NAS protocol. Then they would create two file shares, one on each volume. In this case, the administrator will most probably even create different IP addresses; each will be used to access a dedicated file share. Each volume will have a single write waffinity, and there will be two buckets of space. Though even if two volumes reside on a single controller, and for example on a single aggregate (thus if the second aggregate exists, it will not be used in this case) and both volumes will be accessed through a single IP address, there will still be two write affinities, one on each volume and there always will be two separate buckets of space. Therefore, the more volumes you have, the more write waffinities you'll have (better parallelization and thus better CPU utilization), but then you'll have multiple volumes (and multiple buckets for space thus multiple file shares). =Plexes= SyncMirror replication using plexes Similar to RAID-1, plexes in ONTAP systems can keep mirrored data in two places, but while conventional RAID-1 must exist within the bounds of one storage system, two plexes could be distributed between two storage systems. Each aggregate consists of one or two plexes. Conventional HA storage systems have only one plex for each aggregate, while SyncMirror local or MetroCluster configurations can have two plexes for each aggregate. On the other hand, each plex includes underlying storage space from one or more NetApp RAID groups or LUNs from third-party storage systems (see FlexArray) in a single plex similarly to RAID-0. If an aggregate consists of two plexes, one plex is considered a master and second as a slave; slaves must consist of exactly the same RAID configuration and drives. For example, if we have an aggregate consisting of two plexes where the master plex consists of 21 data and 3 1.8 TB SAS parity drives in RAID-TEC, then the slave plex must consist of 21 data and 3 1.8 TB SAS parity drives in RAID-TEC. The second example, if we have an aggregate consisted of two plexes where master plex consists of one RAID 17 data and 3 parity SAS drives 1.8 TB configured as RAID-TEC and second RAID in the master plex is RAID-DP with 2 data and 2 parity SSD 960 GB. The second plex must have the same configuration: one RAID 17 data and 3 parity SAS drives 1.8 TB configured as RAID-TEC, and the second RAID in the slave plex is RAID-DP with 2 data and 2 parity SSD 960 GB. MetroCluster configurations use SyncMirror technology for synchronous data replication. There are two SyncMirror options: MetroCluster and Local SyncMirror, both using the same plex technique for synchronous replication of data between two plexes. Local SyncMirror creates both plexes in a single controller and is often used for additional security to prevent failure for an entire disk shelf in a storage system. MetroCluster allows data to be replicated between two storage systems. Each storage system could consist of one controller or be configured as an HA pair with two controllers. In a single HA pair, it is possible to have two controllers in separate chassis and distance from each other could be tens of meters, while in MetroCluster configuration distance could be up to 300 km. =Nonvolatile memory= Non-volatile memory cache mirroring in a MetroCluster and HA Like many competitors, NetApp ONTAP systems utilizing memory as a much faster storage medium for accepting and caching data from hosts and, most importantly, for data optimization before writes which greatly improves the performance of such storage systems. While competitors widely using non- volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) to preserve data in it during unexpected events like a reboot for both write caching and data optimization, NetApp ONTAP systems using ordinary random-access memory (RAM) for data optimization and dedicated NVRAM or NVDIMM for logging of initial data in an unchanged state as they came from hosts similarly as transaction logging done in Relational databases. So in case of disaster, naturally, RAM will be automatically cleared after reboot, and data stored in non-volatile memory in the form of logs called NVLOGs will survive after reboot and will be used for restore consistency. All changes and optimizations in ONTAP systems done only in RAM, which helps to reduce the size of non-volatile memory for ONTAP systems. After optimizations data from hosts structured in Tetris-like manner, optimized and prepared with passing few stages (i.e., WAFL and RAID) to be written in underlying disks in RAID groups on the aggregate where data are going to be stored. After optimizations, data is going to be sequentially written on disks as part of the Consistency Point (CP) transaction. Data written to aggregates will contain necessary WAFL metadata and RAID parity so no additional read from data disks, calculate and write to parity disks operations will occur as with traditional RAID-6 and RAID-4 groups. CP at first creating system snapshot on an aggregate where data are going to be written, then optimized and prepared data from RAM written sequentially as a single transaction to the aggregate, if it fails, the whole transaction fails in case of a sudden reboot which allows WAFL file system always to be consistent. In case of successful CP transaction new active file system point is propagated and corresponding NVLOGs cleared. All data are always going to be written to a new place, and no rewrites can occur. Data blocks deleted by hosts marked as free so they could be used later on next CP cycles and the system will not run out of space with the always-write-new-data-to-new-place policy of WAFL. Only NVLOGs in HA storage systems is replicated synchronously between two controllers for HA storage system failover capability, which helps to reduce overall system memory protection overheads. In a storage system with two controllers in HA configuration or MetroCluster with one controller on each site, each of the two controllers divides its own non-volatile memory into two pieces: local and its partner. In MetroCluster configuration with four nodes, each non-volatile memory divided into next pieces: local, local partner's and remote partner's. Starting with the All-Flash FAS A800 system, NetApp replaced the NVRAM PCI module with NVDIMMs connected to the memory bus, increasing the performance.

It was originally a small hamlet outside the city until the industrial revolution caused the growth of Dundee. The area is by and large a residential area. Schools in the area are Morgan Academy Secondary School, Glebelands Primary School and Clepington Primary School. The area is home to the Dundee International Sports Centre (D.I.S.C.). History The area developed around a well which serviced the nearby farmhouses of Janefield and Maryfield. The name Stob derives from the Scots word for a post indicating to travellers that it was to Dundee. Housing was developed in the area by the city's \\"jute barons\\" in the 19th century to accommodate workers in the textile mills in the area and the city. In 1856, the East Dundee Poorhouse was built on a two-acre (8,000 m¬≤) site in the area. After the inception of the National Health Service, the poorhouse was renamed The Rowans and later became a hospital and care-home for the elderly. The building now known as Morgan Academy opened in 1868 as Morgan Hospital, a charitable institution providing accommodation and education for \\"sons of tradesmen and persons of the working class whose parents stand in the need of assistance\\". The present Stobswell Church (itself a union of four local churches) was built in 1874. It is the local Church of Scotland parish church. Education Schools in the area are Morgan Academy Secondary School, Glebelands Primary School and Clepington Primary School. The Melrose Campus of Dundee College is also located in the area. Sports and recreation The area is home to the Dundee International Sports Centre (D.I.S.C.), which staged the European Hockey Championships in 1998. The local Rugby club is Stobswell R.F.C. and play at the McTaggart Sports Centre, Old Glamis Road. The local community also run a number of events. The longest- established is the annual Celebration in the Park, which brings thousands to Baxter Park in August. It also includes a winter Doggyfest and the week-long Stobfest in May. Notable residents * In the summer of 1812, Mary Shelley lived in the area with William Baxter, an acquaintance of her family. She developed a friendship with Baxter's two daughters Christina and Isabel. The dunes, beach, and barren hills near Dundee inspired Mary, and she would describe this scenery in her novella Mathilda (written in 1819-1820). \\"Mary Shelley did not spend time with the William (Edward) Baxter cited here as he was not born until 1825.

Biography Murphey (sometimes incorrectly spelled Murphy) was born in Caswell County, North Carolina, the son of State Senator Archibald Debow Murphey. Appointed from that state as a United States Navy midshipman on May 12, 1834, he was promoted to passed midshipman on July 8, 1839, and to the rank of lieutenant on May 29, 1846. Murphey resigned from the U.S. Navy, in which he served as an instructor at the Norfolk Military Academy in Norfolk, Va., in April 1861. In April 1861 he joined the Virginia State Navy, and was appointed commander of the steam tug Arrow on picket duty in the vicinity of Craney Island. Murphey became a Confederate States Navy officer on 10 June 1861, with the rank of first lieutenant. After working on naval defenses in Virginia and North Carolina, he served at the Gosport Navy Yard in 1861‚Äì62, and then commanded the gunboat in the Mobile Squadron from March 7, 1862. Murphey assumed command of the gunboat in July 1862, and was wounded when Selma was captured in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, by a U.S. Navy squadron headed by Admiral David Farragut. Murphey, who was fondly referred to by his crew and fellow officers as \\"Captain Pat\\", was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren, until exchanged at Cox Wharf, Virginia, on October 18, 1864.

Produced by Nestl√©, Milo was originally developed in Australia by Thomas Mayne in 1934. Most commonly sold as a powder in a green tin, often depicting various sporting activities, Milo is available as a premixed beverage in some countries, and has been subsequently developed into a snack bar, breakfast cereal and protein granola. Its composition and taste differ in some countries. Milo maintains significant popularity in a diverse range of territories, including Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Chile, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand, Venezuela, Jamaica, Peru, Southern Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Manufacture Milo differs among regions, as is seen in this side- by-side comparison of Milo from New Zealand and Ghana. Milo is manufactured by evaporating the water content from a thick syrup at reduced pressure. The thick opaque syrup is obtained from malted wheat or barley that is sourced from companies that produce these raw products. Since 2017, Nestle Philippines has produced Milo using its \\"protomalt\\" formulation. The protomalt is composed of carbohydrates derived from barley and cassava.  History  1940s Milo tin. In 1934, Australian industrial chemist and inventor Thomas Mayne developed Milo and launched it at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Milo began production at the plant located in Smithtown, near Kempsey on the North Coast of New South Wales. The name was derived from the famous ancient athlete Milo of Croton, after his legendary strength.http://www.milo.com.au/about A cup of hot Milo Latest Milo powder of Australia in 2016 Consumption Traditionally in Australia and New Zealand, Milo is served mixed with either hot or cold milk, or sprinkled on top. Milo manufactured outside Australia is customised for local methods of preparation. In Malaysia and Singapore as well as Brunei and some other parts of Asia, Milo with ice added is known as \\"Iced Milo\\" or \\"Milo Ais\\" in Malay Language (alternatively, \\"bing\\" or \\"peng\\", meaning ice in Cantonese and Hokkien respectively). Iced Milo is even available at fast food restaurants such as KFC and McDonald's. Milo is also served locally in kopitiams and mamak stalls in versions such as \\"Milo Dinosaur\\" (a cup of Milo with an extra spoonful of undissolved Milo powder added on top of it), \\"Milo Godzilla\\" (a cup of Milo with ice cream and/or topped with whipped cream) \\"Neslo\\" (combined with Nescaf√© powdered coffee) and \\"Milo Mangkuk\\" (Iced Milo that is served with shaved ice inside a plastic bowl). The Milo powder is also usually used in the making of Batik cake. In Hong Kong, Milo is served in Cha chaan teng. In Malaysia, Milo is also sometimes sprinkled on ice cream or breakfast cereals, or mixed with milk into a paste and spread on bread. Milo can be used as an ingredient in Roti Canai, where it is usually called \\"Roti Milo\\".  Marketing  Milo packaged in cans being sold in a Hong Kong Food Market in Houston 450 g Milo tin in 2016 In Australia and most other countries, the packaging is green and depicts people playing various sports on the tin. A higher malt content form also existed in Australia and was marketed in a brown coloured tin which was usually only available in the 375g size. As of May 2015, this form is no longer manufactured. In Australia, the MILO in2CRICKET and MILO T20 Blast programs, operated in most areas by volunteers, teach children age 5-12 how to play the game of cricket. In the 2016‚Äì2017 season, over 78,000 children participated in the programs. Milo's commercials and taglines are \\"Go and go and go with Milo\\". A recent Australian commercial incorporating this slogan depicts four generations of women on a skipping rope singing \\"and my mum gave me Milo to go and go and go.\\" The tag \\"I need my Milo Today\\" is also used. The packaging of tins of Milo in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore are also green and also have people playing sports on the tins, giving it the affectionate name of \\"Tak Kiu\\", which is Hokkien Chinese for football. In Colombia, Milo is closely tied to football, and the slogan several generations have sung is Milo te da energ√≠a, la meta la pones t√∫ (\\"Milo gives you the energy, you set the goal\\"). Milo is very popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the brand name is synonymous with chocolate flavoured drinks: Milo has a 90% market share in Malaysia (not the often quoted 90% worldwide share of Milo consumption), and Malaysians were said to be the world's largest consumers of Milo. This is because Milo was once used as a nutrient supplement when it was first introduced in the country, and has thus gained a reputation as a 'must have' drink for the old and the younger generations. Milo manufactured in Malaysia is made to dissolve well in hot water to produce a smooth hot chocolate drink, or with ice added for a cold drink. \\"Milo Vans\\" were often associated with sports days in these two countries, during which primary school pupils would queue up to collect their cups of Milo drinks using coupons. In Peru, during the 1970s military dictatorship, Milo labels displayed Peruvian motifs, such as photos and pictures of Peruvian towns, history, crops, fruits, animals, plants, as an educational aid. After 1980, when the military left power, sports predominated on the labels. Milo is sold by Nestl√© in Canada at all major food retailers. Although Milo has been available since the 1970s, a Canadian-specific flavour launched within the last decade that dissolves quicker but maintains the sweet malt flavour profile. It competes with the British brand Ovaltine. Aside from the International section of specific grocery stores and certain Asian grocery stores, Nestl√© does not market Milo in the United States. In 2017 the Colombian manufactured Milo has started appearing on shelves in supermarkets in the United States such as Walmart (Alongside Hispanic sections), and King Soopers (Denver CO). It can also be found in the United Kingdom in some Sainsbury's and Tesco supermarkets, which import it from Kenya and South Africa. Asian food specialists, such as Mini Siam Oriental Foods and Hoo Hing also stock it. A similar product called Ovaltine is most popular with UK consumers. In Ireland, it can be found in many Asian or African stores. Typically they will stock Kenyan or Filipino Milo. In China, it is commonly sold in Western supermarkets, but also smaller convenience stores. Usually packaged in a 240gram flexible foil pouch, single drink packets can also be purchased. The Milo itself contains more milk solids than the Australian Milo. In the past, it was available in Portugal and Brazil. Nestl√© Brazil discontinued production of Milo in Brazil, to focus on the much-popular domestic brands Nescau and Nesquik. The Chilean version of Milo is still in production and is identical in taste and texture to the one that was once produced in Brazil. In May 2013, and after more than 20 years out of the Portuguese market, Nestl√© reintroduced the brand aiming at the high-end market.  Nutritional information  Milo contains 1,680 kJ (402 calories) in every 100 g of the powder, mostly from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can be used for energy by the body, which is the basis of Milo being marketed as an energy drink. Most of the carbohydrate content is sugar. The New Zealand version of Milo is 46 per cent sugar. Milo dissolved in water has a Glycemic Index (GI) of 55, lower than Coca-Cola's GI of 63. However, milk has a much lower GI of 30 - 33, so mixing Milo into a mug of milk yields an overall GI closer to 33. The Milo website states that the drink is high in calcium, iron and the vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12. Milo is advertised as containing \\"Actigen-E\\", but this is just Nestl√©'s trademarked name for the vitamins in the Milo recipe. Milo contains some theobromine, a xanthine alkaloid similar to caffeine which is present in the cocoa used in the product.  Derivative products  Milo is available as a snack in cube form, in Nigeria, Ghana and Dubai. Milo is available as Milo nuggetshttps://www.nestle.com.my/brands/confectionery/milo_nuggets__choco_bar and cereal balls in South East Asia and Colombia.https://www.nestle.com.co/brands/chocolates/milo- nuggetshttps://eshop.tesco.com.my/groceries/en-GB/products/7000126020 Milo chocolate bar. In Australia, a new version of Milo called Milo B-Smart was released in 2008 (the original and malt Milo varieties remain); which is of a finer texture and has added B vitamins and iodine. It has a different taste from the original Milo formula and is marketed as a health food for children.

It is applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an intensive care unit (ICU): an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. The first APACHE model was presented by Knaus et al. in 1981. Application APACHE II was designed to measure the severity of disease for adult patients admitted to intensive care units. It has not been validated for use in children or young people aged under 16. This scoring system is used in many ways which include: # Some procedures or some medicine is only given to patients with a certain APACHE II score # APACHE II score can be used to describe the morbidity of a patient when comparing the outcome with other patients. # Predicted mortalities are averaged for groups of patients in order to specify the group's morbidity. Even though newer scoring systems, such as APACHE III, have replaced APACHE II in many places, APACHE II continues to be used extensively because so much documentation is based on it. Calculation The point score is calculated from a patient's age and 12 routine physiological measurements: # AaDO2 or PaO2 (depending on FiO2) # Temperature (rectal) # Mean arterial pressure # pH arterial # Heart rate # Respiratory rate # Sodium (serum) # Potassium (serum) # Creatinine # Hematocrit # White blood cell count # Glasgow Coma Scale These were measured during the first 24 hours after admission, and utilized in addition to information about previous health status (recent surgery, history of severe organ insufficiency, immunocompromised state) and baseline demographics such as age. The calculation method is optimized for paper schemas, by using integer values and reducing the number of options so that data fits on a single-sheet paper form. The score is not recalculated during the stay; it is by definition an admission score. If a patient is discharged from the ICU and readmitted, a new APACHE II score is calculated. In the original research paper that described the APACHE II score (see references), patient prognosis (specifically, predicted mortality) was computed based on the patient's APACHE II score in combination with the principal diagnosis at admission. APACHE III A method to compute a refined score known as APACHE III was published in 1991. The score was validated on the dataset from 17,440 adult medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at 40 US hospitals. The prognostic system of APACHE III has two options: ; APACHE III Score : This provides an initial risk classification of severely ill hospitalized patients in defined groups. ; APACHE III predictive equation : This uses APACHE III Score with a number of additional variables including the primary reason for ICU admission (from a reference list of 212 conditions classified according to etiology, major organ involved, and distinction between surgical/medical categories); age, sex, race and preexisting comorbidities; and location prior to ICU admission (operating room, recovery or emergency department, transfer or readmission from another hospital or ICU). When possible, data about the interval time between the patient's arrival to hospital and the ICU admission time are collected. To measure severity of disease 20 physiologic variable were selected. APACHE III scores range from 0 to 299. APACHE IV APACHE IV, published in 2006, is the latest version. The model was developed using data from 104 intensive care units (ICUs) in 45 U.S. hospitals and could be recommended to use in U.S. ICUs.

It is marketed as a high-quality aged moonshine whiskey which was produced illegally in Alabama during the mid to late 20th century. The brand was legalized by the moonshiner's son Kenny May. In 2004 it was designated the official \\"State Spirit\\" of Alabama by legislative resolution. Later the same year the brand's founder Kenny May was charged with several violations of Alabama liquor laws, to which he pleaded guilty. After a 15-month period during which the whiskey was unavailable for purchase, the brand ownership was restructured and production resumed.  History  The History of Conecuh Ridge Whiskey begins with Clyde May, a legendary Alabama moonshiner and bootlegger. From the 1950s to the 1980s Clyde managed to produce around 300 gallons a week in a still of his own design in the woods near Almeria, Alabama in Bullock County, southeast of Montgomery. His product was known for its high quality relative to typical moonshine. According to his son, Kenny, the reason was his painstaking insistence on using the best equipment he could fabricate and taking extra steps during production to maintain the purity and quality of the product. While much of it was sold, unaged, as corn liquor, a certain amount would be casked in charred barrels with a couple of dried apples for flavor. This would be aged for about one year. Clyde claimed that the hot Alabama summers accelerated the effect of aging, requiring only one year instead of the minimum of two required for it to be called a Straight Bourbon. This would be bottled and given to friends and valued customers as \\"Christmas Whiskey\\". Always operating outside the state liquor laws, Clyde May served an 18-month sentence at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1973. He gave up his cell to the man who convicted him, Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who was convicted in 1974 on charges from the Watergate scandal. When Clyde May died in 1990 his son Kenny began looking for a way to honor his father's memory by producing legal whiskey from his recipe. Careful planning led to a production run of 4000 bottles of Conecuh Ridge in 2002. Though Conecuh Brands' offices were in Union Springs, the actual producer for its first batches was Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, Ltd. of Bardstown, Kentucky, overseen by master distiller Even Kulsveen. Under contract from Conecuh Brands they had a mash produced using Conecuh Ridge spring water trucked in from Alabama, had the product distilled, aged in oak barrels, and bottled, and returned it to Alabama for distribution. In April 2004, both houses of the Alabama Legislature voted to override the veto of Governor Bob Riley and adopted a resolution, now known as Act of Alabama 2004-97 naming \\"Conecuh Ridge Alabama Fine Whiskey\\" the \\"official state spirit\\". For a few months it was sold in Alabama's 147 ABC State Liquor Stores and privately owned package stores in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. During 2004, citing distribution difficulties and limited demand for the boutique-priced liquor, the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board stopped stocking Conecuh Ridge in its stores, but would still take special orders for customers who requested it. In December 2004, state liquor agents charged Kenny May with misdemeanor violations in two counties. He pleaded guilty to charges of selling liquor without a license, possessing excessive quantities of liquor in a dry county, and selling alcohol to a minor. The Control Board immediately moved to revoke Conecuh Ridge's distribution licence, meaning that once stores sold out of their existing stock, the state's official spirit could no longer be sold in Alabama. May's stock was held in trust pending the outcome of his trial. Attorney Alva Lambert assumed interim leadership of the company, followed by spirits industry veteran Wesley Henderson, who led the company through turbulent times. Under Henderson's leadership, distribution was expanded to additional domestic and international markets.Wesley Henderson then went on to create Angel's Envy Bourbon in 2010. After May entered his guilty plea, the Alabama House of Representatives moved to repeal the declaration of Conecuh Ridge as Alabama's \\"Official State Spirit\\". However, the reversal legislation never passed the Alabama Senate. It remains the \\"Official State Spirit\\" today. Kenny May passed away in 2016. As of March 2009, Conecuh Ridge was purchased by Dallas, Texas-based Spirits Acquisition Corp. In 2014, the company was recapitalized by an investment group, Conecuh Ridge Distillery, Inc., led by chairman James Ammeen and is currently expanding the brand into selected markets throughout the U.S. and abroad. In June 2017, L.C. May, the grandson of Clyde May, joined the company as their National Brand Ambassador thus helping bring the family heritage and history to the brand. In September 2017, Clyde May's Whiskey announced their plans to build a distillery in Troy, Alabama. Troy is located about 20 miles from where Clyde May made his whiskey. Prior to 2013, distillation of Spirits in Alabama was illegal, and Clyde May's Whiskey began searching for a distillery site in early 2015.  Character  Conecuh Ridge is described as an \\"Alabama Style Tippling Whiskey\\", a rather imprecise designation which basically means that it is patterned after the spirits that would have been available at informal \\"tippling houses\\". Clyde May used spring water from Southern Alabama and added oven-dried apples to his barrels. The resulting hints of green apple and cinnamon not only made it smoother than other whiskeys‚Äîthey‚Äôre what made it Alabama Style. It is then aged for five to six years in heavy-toast charred white oak barrels. Awards Clyde May's Whiskey won Best of Category, Gold Medal at the Los Angeles International Spirits Competition 2015. Clyde May's Whiskey won a gold medal for taste in the 2012 MicroLiquor Spirit Awards. Clyde May's Whiskey scored 93 points at the 2017 Ultimate Spirits Challenge. Clyde May's Straight Bourbon scored 93 points at the 2016 Ultimate Spirits Challenge. It also won a gold medal at New York World Wine & Spirits competition that same year.

The school's half-day program operates as the Greater Hartford Academy of Mathematics And Science (also known as GHAMAS). The building houses a grade 6-12 program. It is run by the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC), one of 6 Regional Educational Service Centers (RESC) in Connecticut. Trinity College has been involved in some of the projects with GHAMAS, such as the Brain Bee, a neuroscience competition. Hartford Hospital is involved in school activities as well. The Academy of Aerospace and Engineering was built as GHAMAS in 1999. Labs at the Academy include the Robotics, Physics, Earth Science, Biology, Cell Culture, Greenhouse & Potting, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Special Instrumentation, and Engineering Labs. There are also several smaller student laboratories which are used by students to conduct independent research through a senior design and research course called Capstone. Occasionally, speakers from industry or academia come to lecture full-day and morning half-day students (grades 9 and 10) about the field that they work in and educate them to possible careers in that field. Students partake in a variety of clubs at the high school level, including competitive FIRST Tech Challenge robotics and debate teams. Select students pursue scientific research and engineering projects throughout the year and present their work at the Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair. Each year, some students that have presented exemplary work are chosen by CSEF to compete in the International Science and Engineering Fair AAE has historically been an exclusively half-day program operating as GHAMAS and is now solely a full-day program operating as AAE. Since the fall of 2011, the school holds 9-12 grade half-day, and 6-12 grade full-day students. Ninth and tenth-grade students take three foundation math (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-calculus, or higher) and science (Physics, Earth Science, Biology, and Chemistry) courses in the morning, followed by humanities and other classes at their sending district's high school or with the full-day program. Half-day juniors and seniors take these humanities at their home schools during the morning and join the AAE juniors and seniors for up to four advanced elective courses in the afternoon, such as Molecular and Cellular Biology, Anatomy, Zoology, or Astronomy, along with Advanced Placement curricula. AAE is a member of the NCSSSMST. This is an organization of secondary schools that promote Mathematics, Science, and Technology schools.

The family includes up to 13 genera, distributed around the world's tropics. There are not any great morphological characteristics to distinguish these taxa from others in the order Gentianales.

In terms of anatomy, it is the major part of the subthalamus. As suggested by its name, the subthalamic nucleus is located ventral to the thalamus. It is also dorsal to the substantia nigra and medial to the internal capsule. It was first described by Jules Bernard Luys in 1865, and the term corpus Luysi or Luys' body is still sometimes used. Anatomy Structural connectivity of the human subthalamic nucleus as visualized through diffusion-weighted MRI. =Structure= The principal type of neuron found in the subthalamic nucleus has rather long, sparsely spiny dendrites. In the more centrally located neurons, the dendritic arbors have a more ellipsoidal shape. The dimensions of these arbors (1200 Œºm, 600 Œºm, and 300 Œºm) are similar across many species‚Äîincluding rat, cat, monkey and human‚Äîwhich is unusual. However, the number of neurons increases with brain size as well as the external dimensions of the nucleus. The principal neurons are glutamatergic, which give them a particular functional position in the basal ganglia system. In humans there are also a small number (about 7.5%) of GABAergic interneurons that participate in the local circuitry; however, the dendritic arbors of subthalamic neurons shy away from the border and primarily interact with one another. =Afferent axons= The subthalamic nucleus receives its main input from the external globus pallidus (GPe), not so much through the ansa lenticularis as often said but by radiating fibers crossing the medial pallidum first and the internal capsule (see figure). These afferents are GABAergic, inhibiting neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. Excitatory, glutamatergic inputs come from the cerebral cortex (particularly the motor cortex), and from the pars parafascicularis of the central complex. The subthalamic nucleus also receives neuromodulatory inputs, notably dopaminergic axons from the substantia nigra pars compacta. It also receives inputs from the pedunculopontine nucleus. =Efferent targets= The axons of subthalamic nucleus neurons leave the nucleus dorsally. The efferent axons are glutamatergic (excitatory). Except for the connection to the striatum (17.3% in macaques), most of the subthalamic principal neurons are multitargets and directed to the other elements of the core of the basal ganglia. Some send axons to the substantia nigra medially and to the medial and lateral nuclei of the pallidum laterally (3-target, 21.3%). Some are 2-target with the lateral pallidum and the substantia nigra (2.7%) or the lateral pallidum and the medial (48%). Less are single target for the lateral pallidum. In the pallidum, subthalamic terminals end in bands parallel to the pallidal border. When all axons reaching this target are added, the main efference of the subthalamic nucleus is, in 82.7% of the cases, clearly the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Some researchers have reported internal axon collaterals. However, there is little functional evidence for this. Physiology Anatomical overview of the main circuits of the basal ganglia. Subthalamic nucleus is shown in red. Picture shows 2 coronal slices that have been superimposed to include the involved basal ganglia structures. + and - signs at the point of the arrows indicate respectively whether the pathway is excitatory or inhibitory in effect. refer to excitatory glutamatergic pathways, refer to inhibitory GABAergic pathways and refer to dopaminergic pathways that are excitatory on the direct pathway and inhibitory on the indirect pathway. =Subthalamic nucleus= The first intracellular electrical recordings of subthalamic neurons were performed using sharp electrodes in a rat slice preparation. In these recordings three key observations were made, all three of which have dominated subsequent reports of subthalamic firing properties. The first observation was that, in the absence of current injection or synaptic stimulation, the majority of cells were spontaneously firing. The second observation is that these cells are capable of transiently firing at very high frequencies. The third observation concerns non-linear behaviors when cells are transiently depolarized after being hyperpolarized below ‚Äì65mV. They are then able to engage voltage-gated calcium and sodium currents to fire bursts of action potentials. Several recent studies have focused on the autonomous pacemaking ability of subthalamic neurons. These cells are often referred to as \\"fast-spiking pacemakers\\", since they can generate spontaneous action potentials at rates of 80 to 90 Hz in primates. Oscillatory and synchronous activity is likely to be a typical pattern of discharge in subthalamic neurons recorded from patients and animal models characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is the principal pathology that underlies Parkinson's disease. = Lateropallido-subthalamic system= Strong reciprocal connections link the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the globus pallidus. Both are fast-spiking pacemakers. Together, they are thought to constitute the \\"central pacemaker of the basal ganglia\\" with synchronous bursts. The connection of the lateral pallidum with the subthalamic nucleus is also the one in the basal ganglia system where the reduction between emitter/receiving elements is likely the strongest. In terms of volume, in humans, the lateral pallidum measures 808 mm¬≥, the subthalamic nucleus only 158 mm¬≥. This translated in numbers of neurons represents a strong compression with loss of map precision. Some axons from the lateral pallidum go to the striatum. The activity of the medial pallidum is influenced by afferences from the lateral pallidum and from the subthalamic nucleus. The same for the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The subthalamic nucleus sends axons to another regulator: the pedunculo- pontine complex (id). The lateropallido-subthalamic system is thought to play a key role in the generation of the patterns of activity seen in Parkinson's disease. Pathophysiology Chronic stimulation of the STN, called deep brain stimulation (DBS), is used to treat patients with Parkinson disease. The first to be stimulated are the terminal arborisations of afferent axons, which modify the activity of subthalamic neurons. However, it has been shown in thalamic slices from mice, that the stimulus also causes nearby astrocytes to release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a precursor to adenosine (through a catabolic process). In turn, adenosine A1 receptor activation depresses excitatory transmission in the thalamus, thus mimicking ablation of the subthalamic nucleus. Unilateral destruction or disruption of the subthalamic nucleus ‚Äî which can commonly occur via a small vessel stroke in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or a history of smoking ‚Äì produces hemiballismus. As one of the STN's suspected functions is in impulse control, dysfunction in this region has been implicated in obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Artificially stimulating the STN has shown some promise in correcting severe impulsive behavior and may later be used as an alternative treatment for the disorder. Function The function of the STN is unknown, but current theories place it as a component of the basal ganglia control system that may perform action selection. It is thought to implement the so-called \\"hyperdirect pathway\\" of motor control, contrasting with the direct and indirect pathways implemented elsewhere in the basal ganglia. STN dysfunction has also been shown to increase impulsivity in individuals presented with two equally rewarding stimuli. Research has suggested that the subthalamus is an extrapyramidal center. It holds muscular responses in check, and damage may result in hemiballism (a violent flinging of the arm and leg on one side of the body).

Like other herpesviruses, its informal names are used interchangeably with its formal ICTV name. This virus causes Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer commonly occurring in AIDS patients, as well as primary effusion lymphoma, HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome. It is one of seven currently known human cancer viruses, or oncoviruses. Even after so many years of discovery of KSHV/HHV8, there is no known cure for KSHV associated tumorigenesis. History In 1872, Moritz Kaposi described a blood vessel tumor Translated in (originally called \\"idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin\\") that has since been eponymously named Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KS was at first thought to be an uncommon tumor of Jewish and Mediterranean populations until it was later determined to be extremely common throughout sub-Saharan African populations. This led to the first suggestions in the 1950s that this tumor might be caused by a virus. With the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, there was a sudden resurgence of KS affecting primarily gay and bisexual AIDS patients, with up to 50% of reported AIDS patients having this tumor‚Äîan extraordinary rate of cancer predisposition. Careful analysis of epidemiologic data by Valerie Beral, Thomas Peterman and Harold Jaffe, led these investigators to propose that KS is caused by an unknown sexually transmitted virus that rarely causes tumors unless the host becomes immunosuppressed, as in AIDS. Micrograph of Kaposi sarcoma. H&E; stain. As early as 1984, scientists reported seeing herpesvirus-like structures in KS tumors examined under electron microscopy. Scientists had been searching for the agent causing KS, and over 20 agents were proposed as the possible cause, including cytomegalovirus and HIV itself. The pathogen was ultimately identified in 1994 by Yuan Chang and Patrick S. Moore, a wife and husband team at Columbia University, through the isolation of DNA fragments from a herpesvirus found in a KS tumor in an AIDS patient. Chang and Moore used representational difference analysis, or RDA, to find KSHV by comparing KS tumor tissue from an AIDS patient to his own unaffected tissue. The idea behind this experiment was that if a virus causes KS, the genomic DNA in the two samples should be precisely identical except for DNA belonging to the virus. In their initial RDA experiment, they isolated two small DNA fragments that represented less than 1% of the actual viral genome. These fragments were similar (but still distinct from) the known herpevirus sequences, indicating the presence of a new virus. Starting from these fragments, this research team was then able to sequence the entire genome of the virus less than two years later. The discovery of this herpesvirus sparked considerable controversy and scientific in-fighting until sufficient data had been collected to show that indeed KSHV was the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma. The virus is now known to be a widespread infection of people living in sub-Saharan Africa; intermediate levels of infection occur in Mediterranean populations (including Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Greece) and low levels of infection occur in most Northern European and North American populations. Gay and bisexual men are more susceptible to infection (through still unknown routes of sexual transmission) whereas the virus is transmitted through non-sexual routes in developing countries. Virology KSHV is a herpesvirus, and is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a protein covering that packages its nucleic acids, called the capsid, which is then surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument, and finally enclosed in a lipid envelope derived in part from the cell membrane. KSHV has a genome which is approximately 165,000 nucleic acid bases in length. KSHV is a rhadinovirus, a Herpes genus remarkable since it has stolen numerous genes from host cells including in the case of KSHV genes that encode for complement-binding protein, IL-6, BCL-2, cyclin-D, a G protein-coupled receptor, interferon regulatory factor and Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP), as well as DNA synthesis proteins including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthetase, DNA polymerase and many others. While no other human tumor virus possesses these same genes, other tumor viruses target the same cellular pathways illustrating that at a basic level, all tumor viruses appear to attack the same cellular control pathways, so-called tumor suppressor pathways. After infection, the virus enters into lymphocytes via macropinosomes where it remains in a latent (\\"quiet\\") state. Only a subset of genes that are encoded in KSHV latency associated region (KLAR) are expressed during latency including latency- associated nuclear antigen (LANA), vFLIP, vCyclin and 12 microRNA. Latency is the hallmark of all KSHV associated etiologies known till date including all the KSHV associated oncogenesis. It has been shown that both protein coding genes such and noncoding gene (microRNA) encoded in KLAR region are important for KSHV associated tumorigenesis. To study the functions of microRNA, a detailed protocol of bacmid mutagenesis and a complete set of cell-lines carrying microRNA deletion mutants have been established by leading researchers in the field, that are available as a resource to any international researcher working in field of virus-associated cancer. Additionally, in another study, it has been shown that vFLIP and vCyclin interfere with the TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathway indirectly by inducing oncogenic host mir17-92 cluster. These observations represents a novel mechanism that may be important for KSHV tumorigenesis and angiogenesis, a hallmark of KS. The development of crucial tools such as complete set of 12 microRNA deletion mutants are important development in studying the functions of KLAR gene in context of KSHV associated tumorigenesis Crucial for the Entry of the KSHV is the EPH receptor A2, Hrs, TSG101 and a few Integrins, whose identity has yet to be confirmed. The virus exists as a circular piece of DNA called an episome and uses the cellular replication machinery to replicate itself. LANA is the only viral protein that is required for virus DNA replication during latency. The viral episome is chromatinized upon entry into the host cell nucleus. LANA tethers the viral DNA to cellular chromosomes, inhibits p53 and retinoblastoma protein and suppresses viral genes needed for full virus production and assembly (\\"lytic replication\\"). Why only a subset of virus genes expressed during latency is not fully understood. But it has been shown that the latency associated gene expression can be explained in part by a characteristic epigenetic state that KSHV episome acquires during latency. LANA play an important role during latency. It is shown to regulate both host and virus transcripts and binds to multiple active promoters including host promoters during latency. In the same study, it has also been shown that LANA associates with host machinary hSET1 that creats H3K4me3 marks. However, exact mechanism why KLAR region remains active during latency is not known. It is also shown that Various signals such as inflammation may provoke the virus to enter into lytic replication. When lytic replication occurs, the viral episome starts replicating itself in the form of linear DNA molecules that are packaged into virus particles which are expelled from the cell, to infect new cells or to be transmitted to a new host. When the virus enters into lytic replication, thousands of virus particles can be made from a single cell, which usually results in death of the infected cell. The viral genome consists of a ~145 kbase long unique region, encoding all of expressed viral genes, which is flanked by ~20-30 kbases of terminal repeat sequences. Each terminal repeat unit is 801 bp in length, has 85% G+C content and is oriented in a repetitive head-to-tail fashion. During latency, the virus genome depends on the host replication machinery and replicates as a closed circular episome (\\"plasmid\\") using sequences within the terminal repeats as a replication origin. When the virus reactivates into lytic replication, it is believed that the virus genome is replicated as a continuous linear molecule off from an episome (so-called rolling circle model). As each unit genome is replicated, it is cut within the terminal repeat region, and then packaged into a virus particle (virion). The virus then becomes enveloped with a lipid membrane as it transits the nucleus and the cytoplasm to exit the cell. Thus, whereas KSHV genome is circular in the nucleus of latently infected cells, it is packaged into infectious viruses as a linear molecule. Once the virus newly infects a cell, the lipid membrane is shed and the virion travels to the nucleus. The viral genome is released where it recircularizes through a poorly understood process that appears to involve homologous recombination. The primary viral protein responsible for the switch between latent and lytic replication is known as the ORF50 Replication Transactivation Activator (RTA). When cell signaling conditions activate the generation of RTA, it in turn activates synthesis of a stereotypic cascade of secondary and tertiary viral proteins that ultimately make components of the virus capsid and also the DNA synthesis enzymes required to replicate the virus genome. Pathophysiology The mechanisms by which the virus is contracted are not well understood. Healthy individuals can be infected with the virus and show no signs or symptoms, due to the immune system's ability to keep the infection in check. Infection is of particular concern to the immunocompromised. Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, AIDS patients, and organ transplant patients are all at a high risk of showing signs of infection. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have uncovered that virus is chromatinized during latency. It has also been shown that virus encoded microRNA manipulates and interacts not only with host mRNA but also deregulate host long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). More recently, circularRNAs (circRNAs) are recently discovered in both EBV and KSHV Infection with this virus is thought to be lifelong, but a healthy immune system will keep the virus in check. Many people infected with KSHV will never show any symptoms. Kaposi's sarcoma occurs when someone who has been infected with KSHV becomes immunocompromised due to AIDS, medical treatment, or very rarely aging. KSHV is a known causative agent of four diseases: * Kaposi's sarcoma ‚Äì an angioproliferative tumor that can involve skin (most often), lymph nodes, or viscera, * HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman's disease ‚Äì a lymphoproliferative disorder, * Primary effusion lymphoma ‚Äì KSHV-associated aggressive lymphoma involving B-cells that are immature plasma cells termed plasmablasts and regarded as one type of lymphoid neoplasms with plasmablastic differentiation, * KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome ‚Äì a syndrome with MCD- like symptoms but without associated pathology. Epidemiology The seroprevalence of HHV-8 varies significantly geographically and infection rates in northern European, southeast Asian, and Caribbean countries are between 2-4%, in Mediterranean countries at approximately 10%, and in sub- Saharan African countries at approximately 40%. In South America, infection rates are low in general but are high among Amerindians. Even within individual countries, significant variation can be observed across different regions, with infection rates of about 19.2% in Xinjiang compared to about 9.5% in Hubei, China. Although seroprevalence has been consistently shown to increase with age in a linear manner, countries with high infection rates may see higher seroprevalence in younger age groups. Educational level has shown an inverse correlation with infection rates. Individuals infected with HIV-1 or genital warts are generally more likely to be co-infected with HHV-8. In countries with low seroprevalence, HHV-8 is primarily limited to AIDS and KS patients. In countries with high seroprevalence, infection is frequent in childhood, indicating a likely mother-to-child transmission. In a Zambian survey, all children with KS had mothers who were positive for HHV-8, whereas not all children whose mothers had KS were HHV-8 positive. In another Zambian survey, 13.8% of children were seropositive for HHV-8 by age 4. Seroprevalence has not been shown to vary significantly because of gender or marital status. Evolution The most recent common ancestor of this virus in the Mediterranean, Iran, and Xinjiang, China, has been estimated to have evolved 29,872 years (95% highest probability density 26,851-32,760 years) ago.Liu Z, Fang Q, Zuo J, Minhas V, Wood C, He N, Zhang T (2017) Was Kaposi's sarcoma- associated herpesvirus introduced into China via the ancient Silk Road? An evolutionary perspective. Arch Virol the most recent common ancestor for viruses isolated in Xinjiang was 2037 years (95% highest probability density 1843‚Äì2229 years) ago. Given the historical links between the Mediterranean and Xinjiang during the Roman period it seems likely that this virus was introduced to Xinjiang along the Silk Road. The mutation rate was estimated to be 3.44 √ó 10‚àí6 substitutions per site per year (95% highest probability density 2.26 √ó -6 to 4.71 √ó 10‚àí6). However, the global distribution of different genotypes of KSHV and the potential transmission path need further studies. Typing of isolates is based on the variable K1 membrane protein. Six types are recognised (A-F).Jary A, Leducq V, Desire N, Petit H, Palich R, Joly V, Canestri A, Gothland A, Lambert-Niclot S, Surgers L, Amiel C, Descamps D, Spano JP, Katlama C, Calvez V, Marcelin AG (2020) New Kaposi's sarcoma- associated herpesvirus variant in men who have sex with men associated with severe pathologies. J Infect Dis Prevention Since persons infected with KSHV will asymptomatically give the virus, caution should be used by sex partners in having unprotected sex and activities where saliva might be shared during sexual activity. Prudent advice is to use condoms when needed and avoid deep kissing with partners with KSHV and HIV infections or whose status is unknown. Blood tests to detect antibodies to virus exist. Treatment Kaposi's sarcoma is usually a localized tumor that can be treated either surgically or through local irradiation. Chemotherapy with drugs such as liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel may be used, particularly for invasive disease. Antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir, that target the replication of herpesviruses such as KSHV have been used to successfully prevent development of Kaposi's sarcoma, although once the tumor develops these drugs are of little or no use. For patients with AIDS-KS, the most effective therapy is highly active antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV infection. AIDS patients receiving adequate anti-HIV treatment may have up to a 90% reduction in Kaposi's sarcoma occurrence.  KSHV genes  KSHV encodes for ~90 genes and multiple non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs. The \\"ORF\\" genes are named based on genome position of the homologous genes in the first rhadinovirus described, herpesvirus saimiri.

It involved setting a chorale melody and text as a motet. Stylistically chorale motets were similar at first to motets composed in Catholic countries, and made use of the full range of techniques of Franco-Flemish polyphony. In the earlier period, the chorale was typically used as a cantus firmus, fairly easy to hear, with other lines either weaving in and out contrapuntally around it, or following along in the same rhythm in an entirely homophonic style. Later in the century, especially around 1600, the successive verses of the chorale were used to begin imitative sections in a fugal style. Shortly after 1600 the form began to disappear, overtaken by newer forms based on Italian (especially Venetian) models: the chorale concerto, and later the chorale cantata. The chorale cantata was to become the most substantial of the descendants of the chorale motet, and eventually culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. Composers of early chorale motets included Johann Walter, who typically used a cantus firmus type of motet setting; , who wrote in the complex polyphonic style; , who chose the simpler homophonic style; and Ludwig Senfl, Lupus Hellinck, Thomas Stoltzer, and others. Some of these composers were Roman Catholic: the Thirty Years' War had not yet torn Germany apart, and composers from both branches of Christianity were still mixing freely. Between the late 1560s and the early 1580s, the renowned composer Orlande de Lassus, who was working in Munich, contributed several volumes of chorale motets of his own: Newe Te√ºtsche Liedlein mit f√ºnf Stimmen (books 1 and 2) and Newe teutsche Lieder. In these motets the voices are equally balanced, as in the style of Palestrina. Around 1600 a new group of composers, many of whom had studied in Italy, brought new ideas to the chorale motet. Some of these composers were among the most famous and talented in Europe, including Melchior Franck, Hans Leo Hassler, and the spectacularly prolific Michael Praetorius. Praetorius's Musae Sioniae (1605-1610), an enormous collection of approximately 1200 pieces, includes some of the finest and most advanced examples of the form; however, by this time the chorale concerto and other types of chorale settings were beginning to eclipse the chorale motet as a primary means of expression for the German chorale. Bach's son Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach composed a motet in three movements in the second half of the 18th century, Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, still using Baroques techniques such as a chorale fantasia on Nicolai's \\"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\\" and the inclusion of a setting by his father.

He was drafted by Buffalo Bills in the fourth round (111th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football for Northwestern State. During his career, McGee was considered a versatile threat for his kick return skills as well as his defensive play.  Early life and college career  Terrence McGee grew up in Athens, Texas with his mother and brother, the latter of whom has been incarcerated since 1993. One of his hobbies outside of playing football included drawing with charcoal. McGee attended Northwestern State University, where he played on the football team for four years. He saw sporadic snaps at cornerback in his freshman season before taking on punt return duty the following season, setting the NCAA FCS record with a 23.7 yard average on returns that year with three return touchdowns as a sophomore and earning All- America honors. As the Demons made the FCS playoffs in two consecutive years, McGee became one of the top FCS cornerbacks and even played safety and receiver his final year. He broke up 44 passes and collected 11 interceptions during his college career.  Professional career  McGee was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft. In his rookie season, McGee intercepted two passes and forced a fumble as a part-time player. After the departure of Antoine Winfield, the Bills acquired CB Troy Vincent who was injured and replaced. McGee was inserted as a starting cornerback alongside Nate Clements. During the 2004 season, McGee returned three kickoffs for touchdowns, leading Buffalo as it totaled six total kick return touchdowns on the year, which remains an NFL record. On Christmas Eve 2005 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he became the first player to score touchdowns on an interception and a kick return in the same game. In 2006, he ran a fumble back for a touchdown in a 17-16 loss against the Indianapolis Colts. McGee exhibited his speed in a Monday Night game against the Dallas Cowboys in 2007. Six minutes into the third quarter, McGee returned a kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown. McGee signed a contract extension in September 2009. On December 22, 2009, McGee was placed on Injured Reserve due to a shoulder injury. On February 14, 2013, McGee was cut by the Bills after a few more injury-plagued seasons and he retired shortly afterwards. He played in 122 games, starting 90 of them, and retains numerous cornerback and kick return records for the franchise to this day, making the Pro Bowl once and being named an All-Pro twice. = Bills franchise records = * Most career kickoff return yards (5,450) * Most career kickoff return touchdowns (5) * Longest Kickoff return touchdown: 104 * Most career fumble return yards (106) * Most passes defended (99) Outside football In 2010, McGee donated $25,000 to the Northwestern State athletic department, which at the time was the largest single donation by a former NSU player still professionally active. Along with prominent local figures and fellow Bills alumni Fred Jackson and Brian Moorman, he operates SEAR, a high-end steakhouse in downtown Buffalo.

It was established in June 1960 by the Government of India and later named in honor of engineer, planner and statesman Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. VNIT Nagpur is centrally funded and belongs to the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) system. In 2007, the institute was conferred the status of Institute of National Importance by an Act of Parliament of India. The Institute awards Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees in engineering, technology and architecture, for which the entry is through the Joint Entrance Examination ‚Äì Mains and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering.  History  Unknown to many, the prestigious institute's history can be traced back to 1947, when the Architecture Department was established by Madhya Pradesh Government. In accordance with the second five-year plan (1956‚Äì60) in India, a number of industrial projects were contemplated. The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state. For the Western region in the year of 1960, the Institute was established under the name Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering (VRCE). It was established under the scheme sponsored by Govt. of India and Govt. of Maharashtra. The college was started in June 1960 by amalgamating the State Govt. Engineering College functioning at Nagpur since July 1956. In the meeting held in October 1962, the Governing Board of the College resolved to name it after the eminent engineer, planner, and statesman of the country Sir M.Visvesvaraya. The prime objective of establishing Regional Engineering Colleges was to impart quality technical education throughout the country and foster national integration. The College started functioning in 1960 from camp office in the premises of Govt. Polytechnic, Sadar, Nagpur and subsequently an area of about 214 acres was acquired to house an independent Regional Engineering College at present location. Campus The VNIT Nagpur campus is located in the western part of Nagpur city near Ambazari Lake, about from Nagpur Railway Station and from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport. There are three main entrances to the campus: the Main Gate on South Ambazari Road, the Bajaj Nagar Gate and the Yashwant Nagar Gate. The campus has significant green space, and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The Institute has a gymkhana, as well as grounds for tennis, badminton, basketball, volleyball, football, hockey, and cricket. An NCC unit is also located on campus. There is also an auditorium and a medical centre. Academics =Departments, laboratories and research centers= VNIT Nagpur has many academic departments, with over 30 specialised laboratories and research centres. Departments and laboratories Centers =Programs= Undergraduate programs are offered in Architecture (B.Arch) and eight engineering (B.Tech) disciplines: * Chemical Engineering * Civil Engineering * Computer Science and Engineering * Electrical and Electronics Engineering * Electronics and Communications Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Metallurgical and Materials Engineering * Mining Engineering The Engineering undergraduate programs are usually four years, while Architecture is a five-year program. The institute accepts an incoming freshman class of up to 798 students. Graduate and research programs leading to Master's (M.Arch, M.Sc. and M.Tech) and Ph.D. degrees, are offered by the Architecture department, as well as all basic science departments and all eight engineering departments. A range of special fields of study are available in graduate and research programs in each discipline. The institute will soon offer Aeronautical Engineering. Up to 350 students are admitted to the Master's program each year. The institute uses relative grading on a 10-point scale. =Admissions= Till 2012-13, admission to the undergraduate courses (B.Tech) at NITs was through the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE). From 2013-14, admission to the undergraduate courses (B.Tech) is through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main. The National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have one of the lowest acceptance rates for engineering institutes, around 2 to 3 percent, second only to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in India. From 2015, the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSSA)] conducts common counselling and allocates seats jointly for all Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs). In 2015, over 1,300,000 candidates appeared for the JEE exam for admission to 28,000 undergraduate engineering seats (B.Tech) in 68 centrally-funded technical institutes that included all 19 IITs (10,000 seats), 31 NITs (15,500 seats) and 18 IIITs (2,500 seats).

A wholly owned subsidiary of Fiesta Restaurant Group, it is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. As of August 2020, Taco Cabana had 166 locations throughout Texas and New Mexico. As of July 2017, there were 176 Taco Cabana restaurants. Taco Cabana is known for its pink stores and semi- enclosed patio dining areas. Most menu items are handmade daily on site in open display cooking areas. History =Formation of the restaurant chain= Taco Cabana was founded by Felix Stehling in September 1978 with its first restaurant at the corner of San Pedro and Hildebrand Avenue in Midtown San Antonio. Stehling purchased a vacant Dairy Queen because the family needed additional parking space for their popular bar across the street, the Crystal Pistol. Stehling decided to open a taco stand. The open-air design of the existing structure led to the \\"patio cafe\\" concept that defined the chain's subsequent locations. Felix Stehling's wife, Billie Jo Stehling, created the d√©cor and interior theme for the restaurant chain. After finding all of the patio furniture stolen following the first night of business, Stehling decided to keep the place open 24 hours. The original Mexican patio cafe The restaurant focused on fresh foods, rather than pre-packaged or pre-prepared foods. The restaurant served beer and margaritas, staying open 24-7 and allowing takeout orders. As the business grew, Stehling asked his two brothers to help expand the chain throughout San Antonio. It soon grew to nine restaurants. In 1986 the brothers left the company, after differences in opinion on how to manage the business.Taco Cabana History, Funding Universe In 1990, Taco Cabana began expansion into neighboring states and continued its growth throughout Texas. Richard Cervera became president of the company in 1990, implementing a plan to franchise the brand. =IPO and imitators= In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the success of Taco Cabana encouraged imitators such as Two Pesos. In January 1987 Taco Cabana filed a suit against Two Pesos for allegedly duplicating Taco Cabana's branding style. Two Pesos lost the case and appealed, and in 1992 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Taco Cabana and awarded the company $3.7 million in damages. In 1992 Taco Cabana went public with its first stock offering, and ended the year with 17 restaurants. In January 1993 Taco Cabana announced that it was purchasing cash-strapped Two Pesos' restaurant assets in exchange for 940,000 shares of Taco Cabana stock, valued at approximately $22 million. For $30 million, the sale\\"Ailing restaurant chain to auction Mexican, Italian eateries\\", Houston Business Journal, Allison Wollam included all 30 San Antonio restaurants of Two Pesos. Taco Cabana converted most Two Pesos locations into Taco Cabana restaurants, closed others and sold the associated Shortstop Hamburger chain. Taco Cabana sales hit a high in 1994 at $127 million. That year, Stehling decided to resign as chairman and was succeeded by Cervera. Despite the rise in revenues the company saw while Cervera was in charge, stock prices for Taco Cabana drastically dropped, and Cervera resigned in 1995 and was replaced by Stephen Clark. =Business model change and purchase= In 1995 Cervera resigned as president for a position with the House of Blues, remaining chairman and CEO. Stephen Clark was appointed both COO and president. Clark began evaluating of Taco Cabana's operations with his own management team. He closed several of the company-owned restaurants, restructured some of the franchisee debt, sold assets not related to restaurants, and slowed the expansion. In 1996, Taco Cabana introduced a new type of restaurant to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, reminiscent of an old Mexican cafe. It featured a rounded front, clay tile roofing, aged wood paneling and stainless steel counter tops. Customer visits and profits increased, with plans to extend the designs to new restaurants. =Acquisition by Carrols= Taco Cabana had spent around $30 million on brand image by 2000, and while profits had grown, stock price remained low. Clark began looking at sale options. In 2001 the company became privately held as a wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. After the acquisition, Clark left the company and was succeeded by Mike Biviano. In 2001 it introduced its Mexican grill concept, including made-to- order grilled beef, chicken, pork and shrimp. Throughout 2002, the franchise closed seven stores in the Phoenix, Arizona area, but Taco Cabana proved profitable. In 2003 Taco Cabana began creating a new restaurant prototype with an eight-foot char-grill. That year Taco Cabana opened nine new restaurants.

It features two human fighters who greatly resemble the Karate Champ fighters who fight in a single arena. Players can kick, punch, throw, create fireballs, teleport, and do a jumpkick. The game was completely retooled for a commercial release, as the original concept was considered too repetitive. This prototype was featured in several collections of shareware and freeware games.

Released in 1994 by Epic MegaGames, One Must Fall: 2097 replaced the human fighters with robots. In-game competitors were connected to a machine which allowed them direct control as well as sensation of their robot counterparts. Eleven robots and ten customizable pilots were available for play, along with five arenas and four tournaments. The pilots vary in strength, speed and endurance, thus the many robot/pilot combinations allow for larger replay value. One Must Fall: Battlegrounds A screenshot from One Must Fall: Battlegrounds.

He is best known today for the ballet La fille mal gard√©e and the overture to the opera Zampa. Biography Grave of Ferdinand H√©rold. L. J. F. H√©rold was born in Paris, the only child of Fran√ßois-Joseph H√©rold, a pianist, teacher, and composer, and Jeanne-Gabrielle Pascal. He was the grandson of Nicolas H√©rold, an organist. At the age of six, he attended the Hix Institute and excelled in his studies. While there, he also took musical theory with Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis (who later edited the periodical La Revue musicale). At the age of seven, he played piano and composed some piano pieces. H√©rold's father did not intend for him to follow a musical career, but after his father's death in 1802, he could finally pursue this avenue. He enrolled in the Conservatoire in 1806 and was schooled in piano by Louis Adam (father of the composer Adolphe Adam). He also was instructed by Charles Simon Catel (in harmony), Rodolphe Kreutzer (in violin), and √âtienne M√©hul (in composition). H√©rold during these times at the Conservatoire became a virtuoso on piano and violin. In 1810 he won first prize in a piano competition with one of his own compositions. One of the judges remarked: \\"This piece is full of flaws, but I see great things ahead for him\\". He progressed so far in his studies that in 1812 he won the Prix de Rome. In Rome, during the spring of 1813 he composed his first symphony, which all Prix de Rome winners were required to do in order to show their progression in studies, and also completed the last of his four piano concertos. In 1815 he moved from Rome to Naples for health reasons. While there he composed several pieces including his second symphony and three string quartets. His first opera, La giovent√π di Enrico Quinto, was presented at San Carlo (under the pseudonym Landriani), and it was received favorably by the public (who did not favour French composers), but not by the composers of the area. He was also paid 5,000 lira to teach Joachim Murat's daughters. After the king was executed, H√©rold was forced to leave Italy and went to Austria, where he stayed in Vienna for two months under the employ of Prince Metternich. In Vienna, he wrote a letter of introduction to Beethoven but didn‚Äôt meet him in person.He returned to Paris via Munich and Switzerland. In 1816, H√©rold collaborated with Fran√ßois Adrien Boieldieu in the opera Charles de France. This work put his name before the public. In the same year he composed the successful opera Les Rosi√®res which he dedicated to his friend and former teacher M√©hul. In 1817 his opera La Clochette premiered and was a vast improvement over Les Rosi√®res. After struggling to find a libretto, he composed music for Premier Venu. However, this did not have the qualities to be an opera and it met with little success. Les Troqueurs (1819) also failed. H√©rold's desire to compose forced him to choose any libretto that came his way since many librettists did not trust him with their works. Therefore, his next few operas (L'Amour platonique and L'Auteur mort et vivant) were failures. This discouraged H√©rold, so he did not produce any operas for three years. In 1821, Franz Schubert was invited to write two extra numbers for a production of H√©rold's Das Zaubergl√∂ckchen (La Clochette) at the K√§rntnertor Theatre in Vienna. In 1821 he became an assistant at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien and traveled to Italy to recruit singers. This renewed his inspiration and his health. In 1823 he returned to the stage with the success Le Muletier. His next opera, Lasth√©nie, was a moderate success. H√©rold collaborated with Daniel Auber on Vend√¥me en Espagne (1823) which capitalized on the fad for Spanish atmosphere, following the French victory at Trocadero in Spain. In 1824 the Op√©ra-Comique commissioned him to write Le Roi Ren√©. In the same year he became accompanist at the Th√©√¢tre Italien, and two years later became chorus-master. In 1825 he wrote Le Lapin blanc which failed. H√©rold himself was not inspired by its libretto to compose good music. His next opera Marie (1826) was a great success, but his duties at Th√©√¢tre Italien hindered his freedom to exploit this and further his talent, and for the next three years was reduced to writing ballet music. In 1827, he became the chief replacement at the Paris Opera. On 3 November 1828 he was awarded the Legion of Honour. His next opera L'Illusion (1829) was successful while Emmeline (1830) was not. On 3 May 1831 one of his most famous operas, Zampa, premiered. This opera enjoyed much success in France and Germany where it is still occasionally staged today. He followed up his success with Zampa with contributions to La Marquise de Brinvilliers, a collaborative effort of many composers including Fran√ßois- Adrien Bo√Øeldieu and Daniel Auber. He wrote La M√©decine sans m√©decin in 1832 and Le Pr√© aux Clercs later in the same year. Le Pr√© aux Clercs is another of H√©rold's most famous works, enjoying its 1,000th performance in Paris in 1871. A month after its premiere, H√©rold died at Thernes of tuberculosis from which he had long suffered. H√©rold's opera Ludovic, which had not been completed, was finished by Fromental Hal√©vy. H√©rold was buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The house at 10 rue H√©rold is H√©rold's birthplace. The street was named in his honour in 1881.

The film was the final on-screen appearance of Jeter, who died before it was released, and the film was dedicated to Jeter's memory, as well as to Costner's parents, Bill and Sharon. The film was a box office success and was critically favored. Plot In Montana in 1882, \\"Boss\\" Spearman is an open range cattleman, who, with hired hands Charley, Mose, and Button, is driving a herd cross country. Charley is a former soldier who served in a \\"special squad\\" during the Civil War and feels guilty over his past as a killer of both enemy soldiers and civilians. Boss sends Mose to the nearby town of Harmonville for supplies. The town is controlled by a ruthless Irish immigrant land baron, Denton Baxter, who hates open-rangers. Mose is badly beaten and jailed by the marshal, Poole. The only friendly inhabitant is Percy, a livery stable owner. Boss and Charley become concerned when Mose does not return. They retrieve him from the jail but not before getting a warning from Baxter about free-grazing on his land. Mose's injuries are so severe that Boss and Charley take him to Doc Barlow. There they meet Sue Barlow. Charley is attracted immediately, but assumes that Sue is the doctor's wife. After catching masked riders scouting their cattle, Boss and Charley sneak up on their campfire in the night, and disarm them. At the same time, another attack results in Mose's death. Button is badly injured and left for dead. Charley and Boss vow to avenge this injustice. They leave Button at the doctor's house and go into town, where they lock Poole in his own jail. Boss knocks him out with chloroform he has stolen from the doctor's office. The deputies are locked up as well. Charley learns that Sue is the doctor's sister, not his wife. He declares his feelings for her, and she gives him a locket for luck. Charley leaves a note with Percy, in which he states that if he should die, money from the sale of his saddle and gear are to be used to buy Sue a new tea set, having accidentally destroyed her previous set during a \\"flashback\\" episode. Boss and Charley are pitted against Baxter and his men. Charley shoots Butler, the gunman who shot Button and killed Mose. An intense gun battle erupts in the street, with Boss, Charley and Percy outnumbered before the townspeople begin to openly fight against Baxter. After an intense firefight, Baxter's men are dead and Baxter ends up wounded and alone, trapped in the jailhouse. Boss shoots open the jailhouse door and engages him in a brief close-quarters gunfight which leaves Baxter mortally wounded. Sue's brother tends to the wounded townspeople and open-rangers. Charley speaks to Sue in private, telling her he must leave. She counters that she has a \\"big idea\\" about their future together and that she will wait for him to return. He does return, and proposes to Sue. Charley and Boss decide to give up the cattle business and settle down in Harmonville, taking over the saloon. Cast * Robert Duvall as Boss Spearman * Kevin Costner as Charley Waite * Annette Bening as Sue Barlow * Michael Gambon as Denton Baxter * Michael Jeter as Percy * Diego Luna as Button * James Russo as Marshal Poole * Abraham Benrubi as Mose Harrison * Dean McDermott as Doc Barlow * Kim Coates as Butler * Herbert Kohler Jr. as Cafe Man * Peter MacNeill as Mack * Cliff Saunders as Ralph * Patricia Stutz as Ralph's Wife * Julian Richings as Wylie * Ian Tracey as Tom * Rod Wilson as Gus Production =Inspiration= Kevin Costner grew up reading the western romance novels of Lauran Paine and Open Range is based on Paine's 1990 novel The Open Range Men. Screenwriter Craig Storper wanted to make a movie about \\"the evolution of violence in the West.\\" Storper continues: \\"These characters don't seek violence... But the notion that it's sometimes necessary... is the Western's most fundamental ideal.\\" =Casting= Robert Duvall was the only actor that Costner had in mind for the role of Boss Spearman. Costner said that if Duvall had turned down the part, he might not have made the movie at all. Duvall accepted the role immediately, and Costner gave him top billing. Duvall got bucked off a horse and broke six ribs while practicing his riding for this role. =Filming= Cinematographer J. Michael Muro, was hand-picked by director Kevin Costner for his work on Dances with Wolves. The movie was filmed on location on the Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada. Clayton Lefthand of the Stoney Sioux First Nations worked as a film liaison. Filming took place from June 17, 2002 to September 8, 2002. Production spent over one million dollars to build a town from scratch because Costner didn't like any of the existing ones. This location was so far from civilization that they had to spend $40,000 to build a road to get there. Professional cowboys handled 225 head of cattle on the set. Reception =Box office= Open Range was a success at the box office, making $14 million in its opening weekend in the U.S across 2,075 screens. Against a budget of $22 million it finished its theatrical run with $58.3 million in North America and $10 million from foreign markets for a total of $68.3 million worldwide. =Critical reception= The film received mostly positive reviews, receiving a 79% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus states: \\"Greatly benefiting from the tremendous chemistry between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, Open Range is a sturdy modern Western with classic roots.\\" Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it \\"an imperfect but deeply involving and beautifully made Western\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 4 stars out of 5, writing, \\"Duvall gives his best performance in ages\\" in a \\"tough, muscular, satisfying movie\\". In particular, the gun fighting scenes were intentionally filmed in giant wide shots and were praised for their intense realism by a number of critics and yet were the reason the film earned an R rating. Kevin Carr of FilmThreat.com said on the gun action in Open Range: \\"After The Matrix redefined action in the late 1990s, every crummy action sequence tries to repeat the power of 'bullet time' often with little success. The action in Open Range is filmed real time, grabbing the audience and showing them that when this kind of stuff happens in real life, it happens faster than you think it would.\\" A review on Moviola stated that the film has \\"one of the most exciting final gunfights ever filmed\\". IGN, USA Today, Total Film and Guns & Ammo all also say the shootout scene is one of the best of all time. =Awards= The film won the 2004 Western Heritage Award, and was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award, an MTV Movie Award (Diego Luna), a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award as well as a Taurus Award for stunt artist Chad Camilleri. It was #48 in TimeOut London's \\"The 50 greatest westerns\\" list.

In an intense electric field, the potential barrier of an atom (molecule) is distorted drastically. Therefore, as the length of the barrier that electrons have to pass decreases, the electrons can escape from the atom's potential more easily. Tunneling Ionization is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, since in the classical picture an electron does not have sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier of the atom. When the atom is in a DC external field, the Coulomb potential barrier is lowered and the electron has an increased, non-zero probability of tunnelling through the potential barrier. In the case of an alternating electric field, the direction of the electric field reverses after the half period of the field. The ionized electron may come back to its parent ion. The electron may recombine with the nucleus (nuclei) and its kinetic energy is released as light (high harmonic generation). If the recombination does not occur, further ionization may proceed by collision between high-energy electrons and a parent atom (molecule). This process is known as non-sequential ionization.  DC tunneling ionization  Tunneling ionization from the ground state of a Hydrogen atom in an electrostatic (DC) field was solved schematically by Landau,L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz, Quantum Mechanics (Pergamon, New York, 1965), 2nd ed., pg 276. using parabolic coordinates. This provides a simplified physical system that given it proper exponential dependence of the ionization rate on the applied external field. When E << E_a , the ionization rate for this system is given by: : w = 4 \\\\omega_a \\\\frac{E_a}{\\\\leftE\\\\right} \\\\exp\\\\left[ -\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\frac{E_a}{\\\\leftE\\\\right} \\\\right] Landau expressed this in atomic units where m=e=\\\\hbar=1. In SI units the previous parameters can be expressed as: :E_a = \\\\frac{m^2 e^5}{(4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0)^3 \\\\hbar^4} , :\\\\omega_a = \\\\frac{m e^4}{(4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0)^2 \\\\hbar^3}. The ionization rate is the total probability current through the outer classical turning point. This is found using the WKB approximation to match the ground state hydrogen wavefunction though the suppressed coulomb potential barrier. A more physically meaningful form for the ionization rate above can be obtained by noting that the Bohr radius and Hydrogen atom ionization energy are given by a_0 = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\hbar^2}{m e^2} , E_{ion}=R_H = \\\\frac{m e^4}{8 \\\\epsilon_0^2 h^2} , where R_H \\\\approx \\\\mathrm{13.6\\\\, eV} is the Rydberg energy. Then, the parameters E_a and \\\\omega_a can be written as :E_a = \\\\frac{2 R_H}{e a_0} , \\\\omega_a = \\\\frac{2 R_H}{\\\\hbar}. so that the total ionization rate can be rewritten w = 8 \\\\frac{R_H}{\\\\hbar} \\\\frac{2 R_H/a_0}{\\\\lefte E\\\\right} \\\\exp\\\\left[ -\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\frac{R_H/a_0}{\\\\lefteE\\\\right} \\\\right]. This form for the ionization rate w emphasizes that the characteristic electric field needed for ionization E_a = \\\\frac{2 E_{ion}}{e a_0} is proportional to the ratio of the ionization energy E_{ion} to the characteristic size of the electron's orbital a_0 . Thus, atoms with low ionization energy (such as alkali metals) with electrons occupying orbitals with high principal quantum number n (i.e. far down the periodic table) ionize most easily under a DC field. Furthermore, for a Hydrogenic atom, the scaling of this characteristic ionization field goes as Z^3 , where Z is the nuclear charge. This scaling arises because the ionization energy scales as \\\\propto Z^2 and the orbital radius as \\\\propto Z^{-1} . More accurate and general formulas for the tunneling from Hydrogen orbitals can also be obtained. As an empirical point of reference, the characteristic electric field E_a for the ordinary Hydrogen atom is about 51 \\\\mathrm{\\\\frac{Volt}{Angstrom}} (or 5.1\\\\cdot10^3 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{MV/cm} ) and the characteristic frequency \\\\omega_a is 4.1\\\\cdot 10^4 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{THz} .  AC electric field  The ionization rate of a hydrogen atom in an alternating electric field, like that of a laser, can be treated, in the appropriate limit, as the DC ionization rate averaged over a single period of the electric field's oscillation. Multiphoton and tunnel ionization of an atom or a molecule describe the same process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. The difference between them is a matter of definition under different conditions. They can henceforth be called MPI (multiphoton ionization) whenever the distinction is not necessary. The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schr√∂dinger equation. Combined potential of an atom and a uniform laser field. At distances r < r_0, the potential of the laser can be neglected, while at distances with r > r_0, the Coulomb potential is negligible compared to the potential of the laser field. The electron emerges from under the barrier at r=R_c. E_i is the ionization potential of the atom. When the intensity of the laser is strong, the lowest-order perturbation theory is not sufficient to describe the MPI process. In this case, the laser field on larger distances from the nucleus is more important than the Coulomb potential and the dynamic of the electron in the field should be properly taken into account. The first work in this category was published by Keldysh.Keldysh L V 1965 Soviet Phys. JETP 2354 He modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states (the state of a free electron in the electromagnetic field). In this model, the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As is observed from the figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al.Perelemov A M, Popov V S and Terent'ev M V 1966 SovietPhys. JETP, 23 924Perelemov A M and Popov V S 1967 Soviet Phys.JETP, 25 336 included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which is called the PPT model) was derived for short-range potential and includes the effect of the long- range Coulomb interaction through the first-order correction in the quasi- classical action. In the quasi-static limit, the PPT model approaches the ADK model.Ammosov M V, Delone N B and Krainov V P 1986 SovietPhys. JETP, 64 1191 Many experiments have been carried out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total ion yield and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total ion yield. Among these experiments are those by Chin et al., Augst et al. and Auguste et al. Chin et al. used a 10.6 Œºm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic which is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter. Analytical formula for the rate of MPI ( be careful, there are a lot of typos in the following section ) The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schr√∂dinger equation. The form of this equation in the electric field gauge, assuming the single active electron (SAE) approximation and using dipole approximation, is the following :i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\,t)=-\\\\frac{1}{2m} abla^2\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\,t) + (\\\\mathbf{E}(t)\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}+V(\\\\mathbf{r}))\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\,t) where \\\\mathbf{E}(t) is the electric field of the laser and V(r) is the static Coulomb potential of the atomic core at the position of the active electron. By finding the exact solution of equation (1) for a potential \\\\sqrt{2E_i}.\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r}) ( E_i the magnitude of the ionization potential of the atom), the probability current \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) is calculated. Then, the total MPI rate from short range potential for linear polarization, W(\\\\mathbf{E}, \\\\omega), is found from : W(\\\\mathbf{E}, \\\\omega)=\\\\lim_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_0^\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\omega} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)\\\\,dz\\\\,dy\\\\,dt where \\\\omega is the frequency of the laser, which is assumed to be polarized in the direction of the x axis. The effect of the ionic potential, which behaves like \\\\frac{Z}{r} ( Z is the charge of atomic or ionic core) at a long distance from the nucleus, is calculated through first order correction on the semiclassical action. The result is that the effect of ionic potential is to increase the rate of MPI by a factor of : I_{PPT}=(2(2E_i)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{n^{*}} Where n^{*}=Z/\\\\sqrt{2E_i} and F is the peak electric field of laser. Thus, the total rate of MPI from a state with quantum numbers l and m in a laser field for linear polarization is calculated to be : W_{PPT}=I_{PPT}W(\\\\mathbf{E}, \\\\omega)=C_{n^{*}l^{*}}^{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6}{\\\\pi}}f_{lm}E_{i}(2(2E_i)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{2n^{*}-m-3/2}(1+\\\\gamma^{2})^{m/2+3/4}A_{m}(\\\\omega, \\\\gamma)e^{-\\\\frac{2}{3}g(\\\\gamma)(2E_i)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}/F} where \\\\gamma= \\\\frac{\\\\omega \\\\sqrt {2E_i}}{F} is the Keldysh\`s adiabaticity parameter and l^{*}=n^{*}-1 .The coefficients f_{lm} , g(\\\\gamma) and C_{n^{*}l^{*}} are given by : f_{lm}= \\\\frac{(2l+1)(l+m){!}}{2^{m}m{!}(l-m){!}} : g(\\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{3}{2\\\\gamma} ((1+\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\gamma^{2}})\\\\sinh^{-1}(\\\\gamma)-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\gamma^{2}}}{2\\\\gamma}) :C_{n^{*}l^{*}}^{2}= \\\\frac{2^{2n^{*}}}{n^{*}\\\\Gamma(n^{*}+l^{*}+1)\\\\Gamma(n^{*}-l^{*})} The coefficient A_{m}(\\\\omega, \\\\gamma) is given by : A_{m}(\\\\omega, \\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{4}{\\\\sqrt{3\\\\pi}}\\\\frac{1}{m!}\\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}}{1+\\\\gamma^{2}}\\\\sum_{n>v}^{\\\\infty}e^{-(n-v)\\\\alpha(\\\\gamma)}w_{m}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\gamma^{2}}}(n-v)}\\\\right), where : w_{m}(x)=e^{-x^{2}}\\\\int_0^x (x^2-y^2)^m e^{y^2}\\\\,dy : \\\\alpha(\\\\gamma)= 2(\\\\sinh^{-1}(\\\\gamma)-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\gamma^{2}}}) : v= \\\\frac{E_i}{\\\\omega}(1+\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\gamma^{2}}) The ADK model is the limit of the PPT model when \\\\gamma approaches zero (quasi-static limit). In this case, which is known as quasi-static tunnelling (QST), the ionization rate is given by : W_{ADK}=C_{n^{*}l^{*}}^{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6}{\\\\pi}}f_{lm}E_{i}(2(2E_i)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{2n^{*}-m-3/2}e^{-(2(2E_i)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}/3F)} . In practice, the limit for the QST regime is \\\\gamma <1/2 . This is justified by the following consideration. Referring to the Figure, the ease or difficulty of tunneling can be expressed as the ratio between the equivalent classical time it takes for the electron to tunnel out the potential barrier while the potential is bent down. This ratio is indeed \\\\gamma , since the potential is bent down during half a cycle of the field oscillation and the ratio can be expressed as : \\\\gamma =\\\\frac {\\\\tau_T} {\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\tau_L}, where \\\\tau_T is the tunneling time (classical time of flight of an electron through a potential barrier, and \\\\tau_L is the period of laser field oscillation. MPI of molecules Contrary to the abundance of theoretical and experimental work on the MPI of rare gas atoms, the amount of research on the prediction of the rate of MPI of neutral molecules was scarce until recently. Walsh et al. have measured the MPI rate of some diatomic molecules interacting with a 10.6 Œºm CO2 laser. They found that these molecules are tunnel-ionized as if they were structureless atoms with an ionization potential equivalent to that of the molecular ground state. Talebpour et al. were able to quantitatively fit the ionization yield of diatomic molecules interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser pulse. The conclusion of the work was that the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule can be predicted from the PPT model by assuming that the electron tunnels through a barrier given by \\\\frac{Z_{eff}}{r} instead of barrier \\\\frac{1}{r} which is used in the calculation of the MPI rate of atoms. The importance of this finding is in its practicality; the only parameter needed for predicting the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule is a single parameter, Z_{eff} . Using the semi-empirical model for the MPI rate of unsaturated hydrocarbons is feasible. This simplistic view ignores the ionization dependence on orientation of molecular axis with respect to polarization of the electric field of the laser, which is determined by the symmetries of the molecular orbitals. This dependence can be used to follow molecular dynamics using strong field multiphoton ionization. Tunneling time The question of how long a tunneling particle spends inside the barrier region has remained unresolved since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is sometimes suggested that the tunneling time is instantaneous because both the Keldysh and the closely related Buttiker-Landauer times are imaginary (corresponding to the decay of the wavefunction under the barrier). In a recent publication the main competing theories of tunneling time are compared against experimental measurements using the attoclock in strong laser field ionization of helium atoms. Refined attoclock measurements reveal a real and not instantaneous tunneling delay time over a large intensity regime. It is found that the experimental results are compatible with the probability distribution of tunneling times constructed using a Feynman Path Integral (FPI) formulation.

He was signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2004. He played college football at LSU. Gay also played for the New Orleans Saints. He played on a Super Bowl winning team with both the Patriots and the Saints, and is also noted for being one of the two Louisianan-born (other being former LSU and Saints teammate, Devery Henderson) having won a championship at both the college and pro level for teams of Louisiana, his home state. Early years At Brusly High School in Brusly, Louisiana, Randall Gay was a four-year letterman in football. He also lettered in weight lifting (three years) and track (one year). He was a first team All-Metro selection, and a first team All-District selection in football during his last two years of high school. As a senior, in only eight games, he rushed for 1,067 yards and 13 touchdowns, caught three touchdown passes, and returned two punts for touchdowns. College career He played college football at LSU. He won a BCS National Championship in 2003 with LSU as a nickel back. Professional career =New England Patriots= On April 29, 2004, he was signed by the Patriots shortly after the NFL draft as an undrafted free agent. His rookie year, Gay beat out cornerback Christian Morton, the Patriots' 7th-round draft pick, for a place on the roster. Later in the season, Gay was placed into the starting lineup because of injuries to veterans Ty Law and Tyrone Poole. Gay's rookie season concluded with a victory in Super Bowl XXXIX, in which he started opposite Asante Samuel where he was the leading tackler with 11 solo tackles. Gay was involved in several low level controversies as a Patriot: He failed to make a full contribution in 2005 and 2006, due to injuries that landed him on injured reserve. This led to some long running criticisms from the tough vocal New England fans and repeated questions about him on the region's talk shows and in the papers. Hence, after failing to deliver up to expectations of New England Patriots fans in both the 2005 and 2006 seasons, before the 2007 training camp, Gay was quoted as saying: Gay returned in 2007 and played primarily as a nickel back and a backup safety. He did start several games, including the AFC Divisional Game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Gay intercepted a career-high three passes while playing in every game of the 2007 season en route to a perfect regular season that ended with the Patriots' defeat at the hands of the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. =New Orleans Saints= On March 2, 2008, Gay signed a four-year, $17.8 million contract with the New Orleans Saints. The deal included an $3.75 million signing bonus and $6.9 million in guaranteed money. He was a member of the Saints' 2009 Super Bowl XLIV Championship team.

Even though he led a run oriented Wing T Offense, he recorded a 50% completion average, 1,441 passing yards and 8 touchdowns. He was a rare two-sport standout, that also showed the talent to play professional baseball after his fastball was clocked at 94-mph. As a senior, he finished with an 11‚Äì0 record, a 1.20 earned-run average, 116 strikeouts and earned the Gatorade National Baseball Player-of-the-Year award. In school, he was a straight-A student and his college entrance exam score ranked among the top 10% in the country. College career Hutchinson accepted a football scholarship from Stanford University over professional baseball. In 1996 as a redshirt freshman, he was named the starting quarterback over senior Tim Carey. He started slowly, but improved during the season. He suffered a sprained thumb in week seven's 41‚Äì9 loss against Arizona State University, forcing him to miss practice the week leading up to the game against UCLA. He was still able to guide Stanford on an 80-yard drive in the final minutes to pull off a 21-20 win, where he was seven-of-seven, culminating on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Brian Manning with 0:58 seconds remaining in the contest. His best game was the 38-0 win in the 1996 Sun Bowl against Michigan State University, where he earned Most Valuable Player honors after completing 22 out of 28 passes for 226 yards and one touchdown. He finished the season with 11 starts, 190 out of 312 completions for 2,134 yards, 10 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. As a sophomore, he started 11 games, completing 189 out of 315 passes for 2,101 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. In the season opener against San Jose State University, he completed 18 out of 36 passes for 302 yards and one touchdown. In the 58-49 win against the University of Oregon, he completed 21 out of 31 passes for 340 yards and tied a school record with 4 touchdowns. In the tenth game against Washington State University he only had one play before leaving with an injured right thumb. In the season finale 21‚Äì20 win against the University of California, he completed 21 out of 25 passes for 194 yards and one touchdown. In July 1998, he left school with two seasons of eligibility remaining, in order to play professional baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals. In two seasons he threw for 4,235 yards, 20 touchdowns and 22 interceptions in 23 starts. At the time he ranked seventh All-time in the school's career passing list, fifth in career completion percentage, seventh in career completions, eighth in career attempts, ninth in total offense and eleventh in career touchdown passes. Scouts considered him to be a potential first-round draft choice in the NFL Draft. His development in football came without the benefit of spring practice, because he also was a starting pitcher for the Stanford Cardinal baseball team. In the spring of 1996, he played as a true freshman and was named the number two starter in the pitching rotation. He compiled a 7-2 record, 70 strikeouts (tied for sixth in the Pac-10) and a 3.51 ERA (fourth in the Pac-10). He also ranked among the league leaders in complete games (4), innings pitched (842) and strikeouts per-nine-innings (7.5). He helped the team finish with a 41-19 record, a second place in the Pac-10 and an appearance in the NCAA West Regional. He received first-team freshman All- American and honorable-mention All-Pac 10 honors. As a sophomore, his 8‚Äì3 record and 110 strikeouts, helped the team reach the 1997 College World Series. As a junior, he had a 10-5 record, making 115 strikeouts in 99.1 innings. He compiled a career record of 25-11 and ranked eighth All-time in school history in wins and sixth in strikeouts with 299. His career ERA was 4.80. He contributed to the team winning the Pac-10 Southern Division championship in 1997 and 1998. Baseball career Although Hutchinson had signed a letter of intent to attend Stanford University and was asking for a $1.5 million signing bonus (at the time one of the biggest bonus ever by a draftee), he was still selected 26th overall in the first round because of his potential, after being drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. He decided to attend college, even after the Braves met most of his demands. He was selected in the second round (48th overall) of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. In July , he signed a four-year, $3.5 million contract ($2.4 million signing bonus and a $1.1 million four-year guaranteed contract) to forgo the NFL and play exclusively baseball. He began his professional career with the Class-A New Jersey Cardinals, registering an 0-1 record in 3 starts. He was promoted to the Class-A Advanced Prince William Cannons on August 15. He made five starts, going 2-0 with a 2.79 ERA and earning his first professional win against Salem on August 21, after pitching six innings and allowing two solo homers with a walk and six strikeouts. In , he completed his first full professional season with a combined 9-11 record between the Arkansas Travelers (AA) and the Memphis Redbirds (AAA). He spent most of the season at Arkansas, where he was 7-11 with a 4.72 ERA in 25 starts. He tied for the team lead in wins (seven) and finished second with 150 strikeouts in 141 innings pitched. He struck out 10 or more in three of his starts and was a part of three combined shutouts. He allowed just one hit and had 11 strikeouts in 8 innings pitched during a win at Shreveport (8/6), leading to his selection as Texas League Pitcher for the week ending August 8. On August 27, he was promoted to Memphis and made two starts, going 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA. He earned a win at Vancouver by striking out 11 in 6 innings. On September 27, he was recalled by the St. Louis Cardinals but did not appear in any games. In , he struggled through an injury-plagued campaign in which he split time between the Memphis Redbirds (AAA) and the Arkansas Travelers (AA). He pitched only 56.1 innings on the year, posting 63 strikeouts and ranking eighth in the Cardinals organization with 10.1 strikeouts-per-nine innings pitched. He opened the season at Memphis, but got off to a bad start before being sent to Arkansas. He pitched well in 8 starts for the Travelers, allowing just one unearned run over 18 innings in one stretch, before being shelved with right elbow problems for more than two months. He returned to pitch three games at season's end, recording 15 strikeouts and 3 walks in 11 innings. He then played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League. In , he opened the season on the Cardinals' major league roster and pitching 4 innings in three appearances, before being sent down to the Memphis Redbirds (AAA) on April 22. He remained the rest of the season in Memphis, producing a 4-9 record and a 7.92 ERA in 20 starts. He recorded 111 strikeouts in 97.2 innings and had a 3 game winning streak in July. Hutchinson spent over four seasons in the Cardinals organization, moving mostly between Class A and Class AAA ball, while compiling a 17-25 record and a 5.63 ERA. He pitched in the Major Leagues in three games, all in relief, for the St. Louis Cardinals during the 2001 season. He did not fare well, giving up 16 baserunners (nine hits, six walks, and one hit batsman) and 11 earned runs in just four total innings. His MLB career totals include an 0‚Äì0 record, two strikeouts (Ben Petrick and Denny Neagle), and an ERA of 24.75. Football career =Dallas Cowboys= Struggling after a stint in minor league baseball, Hutchinson decided to focus on professional football and held an open workout in 2002 that was attended by three teams (Dallas, Chicago and Kansas City). Expecting that he could regain his football form, the Dallas Cowboys won a bidding war for his services on January 26, signing him as an undrafted free agent to a contract that included a $3.1 million bonus, three years guaranteed at $5 million and a no-baseball clause. As a 25-year-old rookie, Hutchinson was named the starter after a struggling Quincy Carter lost to the Arizona Cardinals and engaged in a heated sideline argument with Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones. Hutchinson's first start was the 17‚Äì14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks where Emmitt Smith broke the NFL all-time rushing record. His best game came against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 21‚Äì19 victory, when he passed for 301 yards (most yards by a rookie since Troy Aikman in 1989) and 2 touchdowns. He finished with nine starts, completing 127 out of 250 attempts for 1,555 yards, 7 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions and set an NFL rookie record by throwing 95 straight passes without an interception to start a career. A record broken by Carson Wentz at 134 then by Dak Prescott at 176 in 2016. In 2003, with the arrival of new head coach Bill Parcells, all positions were opened to competition, and Hutchinson became involved in a publicized quarterback controversy, when he and Carter competed for a roster spot in the 2002 edition of Hard Knocks, an HBO series that covers the training camp of an NFL team. Carter eventually regained the starting role, bringing stability to the quarterback position and leading the team to a 10‚Äì6 record and a playoff appearance. Hutchinson saw his only action of the season in the sixth game against the Detroit Lions, taking over for Carter for the final four drives (including kneel downs), completing one out of two passes for 8 yards. In 2004, the Cowboys group of quarterbacks had expanded with the trade for yet another former baseball player (Drew Henson) and the acquisition of Vinny Testaverde off waivers, who was later named the starter after Carter was released under unclear circumstances on August 4. Hutchinson was waived on July 27. He left with a 2‚Äì7 record, 128 completions out of 252 attempts, 1,563 passing yards, 7 touchdown passes and 8 interceptions. He also became part of a succession of short-tenured quarterbacks following the retirement of Aikman, that included Carter, Randall Cunningham, Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe, Anthony Wright, Ryan Leaf, Henson and Clint Stoerner. =Rhein Fire (NFL Europe)= In 2004, the Cowboys allocated Hutchinson to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, so he could work on his accuracy and mechanics. He played inconsistently before suffering a sprained right shoulder in the week 8 contest against the Cologne Centurions, forcing him to miss the final 2 games and losing nearly a month rehabilitating it back to health. He had a 3-5 record, completing 126 out of 207 passes for 1,356 yards, 5 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. =Chicago Bears= On September 29, 2004, Hutchinson was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Bears, after Rex Grossman suffered a season-ending knee injury in the third game of the season, reuniting with quarterback coach Wade Wilson who also held that position with the Cowboys. He would become the fourth quarterback that year to start for the team, after Jonathan Quinn and Craig Krenzel were ineffective in their appearances. Grossman was the projected starter entering the 2005 season, until suffering a broken ankle in preseason. Although Hutchinson was initially named the starter, he was eventually replaced in favor of rookie Kyle Orton, after he had poor preseason performances and the decision to sign Jeff Blake to be the backup. Following his demotion, he was released on August 31. Personal life Hutchinson lives with his wife, and his son. His wife is the sister of baseball player Todd Walker. His father Lloyd was an outfielder in the Philadelphia Phillies' farm system and his brother Trevor was a pitcher in the Florida Marlins organization.

Origins of the MGB The MGB was just one of many incarnations of the Soviet State Security apparatus. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks relied on a strong political police or security force to support and control their regime. During the Russian Civil War, the Cheka were in power, relinquishing it to State Political Directorate (GPU) in 1922 after the fighting was over. The GPU was then renamed The People‚Äôs Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in 1934. From the mid-1930s and until the creation of the KGB, this \\"Organ of State Security\\" was re-organized and renamed multiple times depending on the needs and fears of the leadership. In 1941, the state-security function was separated from the NKVD and became the People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB), only to be reintegrated a few months later during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1943, the NKGB was once again made into an independent organization in response to the Soviet occupation of parts of Eastern Europe. SMERSH‚Äîanecdotally derived from a phrase translated as \\"Death to Spies\\"‚Äîwas designed to be a counter- intelligence unit within the Red Army to ensure the loyalty of the army personnel. Following the end of the war, both the NKVD and the NKGB were converted to ministries and redubbed the Ministry for Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Ministry for State Security (MGB). The MGB and MVD merged again in 1953, orchestrated by Lavrenty Beria, who was then arrested and executed. The KGB took on the mantle of the NKGB/ MGB and, in 1954, broke off from the reformed MVD. Functions of the MGB The MGB essentially inherited the \\"secret police\\" function of the old NKVD, conducting espionage and counterespionage, as well as enacting a policy of supervision and surveillance to keep control and to prevent disloyalty. After World War II, the MGB was used to bring the newly acquired Eastern Bloc under Soviet control. It enforced rigid conformity in the satellite states of Eastern Europe and infiltrated and destroyed anticommunist, anti-Soviet, or independent groups.\\"Encyclopedia :: K :: KGB.\\" Rusnet. Web. 19 May 2011.. The protection, policing, and supervision of the Soviet Union fell to this new agency, as it was the main agency responsible for the security of the Union. The MGB directed espionage networks at home and abroad, and also organized both domestic and foreign counterintelligence. They were also responsible for enforcing security regulations, monitoring and censoring information leaving or coming into the country; and supervising the vast majority of Soviet life, including the planting and organizing of agents to track and monitor public opinion and loyalty; as well as ensuring the safety of important government and party officials.Fainsod, Merle. \\"Developments in Soviet Public Administration,\\" p. 711. JSTOR. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2126230. The MGB, above all else, was a security organization, and as such, was designed for covert and clandestine surveillance and supervision. The intelligence apparatus was able to permeate every level and branch of state administration, with agents planted in collective farms, factories, and local governments, as well as throughout the upper level and rank and file of Soviet bureaucracy. Each department within the government also had their own official supervisor, a \\"Special Section\\" staffed by the MGB to keep tabs on and regulate the employees, and to ensure the absence of disloyalty.Fainsod, p. 710. The Ministry retained a high level of autonomy and a remarkable amount of freedom of operation within the Soviet system, as the agency was only responsible to the Central Committee. MGB agents had the power to arrest and sentence opponents upon receiving approval from a higher authority, a clause oft ignored. The OSO (the Special Council of the State Security Ministry) convicted arrestees charged with committing political crimes, including espionage, and could banish them from certain areas, or from the USSR entirely.Fainsod, p. 711. In Stalin‚Äôs last years, between 1945 and 1953, more than 750,000 Soviet citizens were arrested and punished.\\"KGB (agency, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) :: Pre-KGB Soviet Security Services -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia.\\" Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Web. 19 May 2011. . Many of the arrests made by the MGB were founded on flimsy or fabricated evidence, most notably on the \\"suspicion of espionage\\" (podozreniye shpionazha, or PSh). Since in many cases it is impossible to prove any espionage activities or even an intention to spy, the case is built on the \\"suspicion of espionage\\", making acquittal impossible.Wolin, Simon, and Robert M. Slusser. The Soviet Secret Police. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1974, p. 133. Structure The general structure of the MGB is much the same as both the organization it came from, the NKGB, and the organization that followed, the KGB The MGB was composed of several departments or directorates with a specific purpose within the organization. =Major Departments= First Main Directorate First Main Directorate was responsible for foreign intelligence. The First Main Directorate maintained surveillance over the \\"Soviet colony\\" (SK‚ÄîSovetskaya koloniya), i.e., the personnel of Soviet diplomatic, trade, technical, cultural, and other agencies functioning abroad. It also sought to infiltrate foreign governmental bodies, businesses, public organizations, sensitive industrial plants, cultural and educational institutions, etc., placing MGB agents in strategic posts for intelligence- gathering and possible covert action.Wolin and Slusser, pp. 138-139. In 1947 the GRU (military intelligence) and MGB's 1st Main Directorate were combined into the recently created foreign intelligence agency, the Committee of Information (KI), under the control of Vyacheslav Molotov, in an attempt to streamline the intelligence needs of the State. In 1948, the military personnel in KI were returned to the GRU. KI sections dealing with the new East Bloc and Soviet √©migr√©s were returned to the MGB later that year. In 1951, the KI returned to the MGB, as a First Main Directorate of the Ministry of State Security.\\"KGB.\\" Universitat De Val√®ncia. Web. 19 May 2011. . Second and Third Main Directorates The Second Main Directorate focused on domestic counterintelligence and acted as an internal security and political police force. The goal of this department was to combat foreign intelligence operations within the USSR and its territories. The Second Directorate worked mainly inside the country to combat foreign espionage and to study the forms and methods used by foreign intelligence services on the territory of the U.S.S.R. The work it did abroad aimed to organize operational-technical intelligence, i.e., the investigation of the forms, working methods and regulations of the intelligence, counterintelligence, and police and administrative organs of foreign countries.Wolin and Slusser, p. 168. The Third Main Directorate was concerned with military counterintelligence. It carried out many of the same tasks as SMERSH, which it absorbed, as it conducted political surveillance of armed forces.Mitrokhin, Vasili. KGB Lexicon: the Soviet Intelligence Officer's Handbook. London: Frank Cass, 2002. Google Books. Web. . It relied heavily on the Army Special Section to ensure the loyalties of the soldiers and officers.Fainsod, p. 711. The MGB operatives were used to supervise personnel and daily action, as well as to carry out counterintelligence operations. The Fifth Main Directorate The Fifth Main Directorate evolved out of the Main Secret Political Administration. It was responsible for regulating and repressing real or imagined dissent within the party apparatus and Soviet society. This involved supervising almost every aspect of Soviet life, including the intelligentsia, bureaucracy, general administrative agencies, cultural organizations, educational institutions, and even the party apparatus itself. They investigated the political reliability of the entire population of the Soviet Union, with particular attention to the Party and Soviet apparatus, up to the highest leaders of the Party and government. They also secretly supervised the activity of the entire administrative and economic apparatus of the state and all scientific, public, church, and other organizations. The goal was to hunt down \\"deviations from the general line,\\" \\"opposition leanings\\" within the party to ferret out and eliminate \\"bourgeois nationalism\\" in the Soviet satellites, i.e., anti-Soviet movements under the guise of nationalism.Wolin and Slusser, p. 166. =Minor Departments= the Fourth Directorate At the beginning of the MGB, the Fourth Directorate was designed as a proto- terrorist force to combat the anti-Soviet underground, nationalist formations, and hostile elements.\\"History of the MGB: The Fourth Directorate.\\" TELUS Internet Services - Member Services. Web. 19 May 2011. . However, Viktor Abakumov dissolved this department in 1946, but kept the main players in a Special Service group so that they could continue with the same pattern of violence that the Fourth Directorate was known for. The group was also ultimately dissolved in 1949.Parrish, Michael. The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939-1953. Westport, CT: Praeger, 1996, pp. 174, 314-318. Upon the destruction of the Fourth Directorate as a terrorist group, the department was transitioned into Transportation Security. It was responsible for the preparation and security of mobilization and transport. The department was also responsible for counterintelligence and surveillance operations within their transport programs.Wolin and Slusser, p. 136. The Sixth Directorate This department was a short-lived organization designed to collect and process Signals Intelligence, or SIGINT. The department was initially composed of the NKGB‚Äôs 5th Directorate (responsible for wartime communications) and an independent cryptography department, the 2nd Special Department. However, this Directorate was competing with another better-funded communications organization, Department ‚ÄòR‚Äô, which specialized in radio counterintelligence. The 6th Directorate was dissolved in 1949, and its resources and personnel absorbed into the Special Services Department (GUSS), a cryptanalysis and information security branch of the Central Committee.Leeuw, Karl De., and Jan Bergstra. The History of Information Security: a Comprehensive Handbook. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2007, pp. 505-506. Economic Administration Known as the ‚ÄòK‚Äô Division, this organization supervised the economy and ran economic counterintelligence and industrial security. They were concerned with the implementation of security programs and requirements, as well as the supervision and monitoring of the workers, leading them to make extensive use of the Special Sections within the state and local organizations.Wolin and Slusser, pp. 115-117. The Second Special Administration Sometimes called the Seventh Directorate, this section was responsible for providing the tools, techniques, and manpower to accommodate the physical surveillance needs of the MGB. They offered facilities, devices, and methodology to help with the demands of the intelligence departments. They were able to do both outdoor (tailing) and photographic surveillance, as well as being able to tap phone lines, monitor conversations in other rooms through hidden microphones and covertly examining mail. They also had sections devoted to codes, cryptography, and ciphers.Wolin and Slusser, p. 110-111. The Division for the Protection of Leaders Otherwise known as the Guards Directorate, they were charged with the personal security of the top party officials. The Division provided personal security to members and alternates of the Presidium of the Central Committee, ministers of the U.S.S.R. and their deputies, secretaries of the Central Committee, and a number of high officeholders specifically listed. The Division was also responsible for guarding important agencies and installations of the secret police themselves.Wolin and Slusser, p.114. A number of the top officials from this department were implicated in the Doctors' Plot, showing the inherent mistrust and suspicion within the Soviet security apparatus.Knight, Amy W. Beria, Stalin's First Lieutenant. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993, pp. 169-171.

The design has been well received, and has since become one of the most popular freeway-to-arterial interchange designs in North America. It has also been used occasionally in some European countries, such as Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Comparison with other interchanges *A diamond interchange has four ramps. *A cloverleaf interchange has eight ramps, as does a stack interchange. These are fully grade separated, unlike a parclo ‚Äì traffic flows without stops on all ramps and throughways. *A parclo generally has either four or six ramps; less common are parclos with five ramps. Naming In Ontario, the specific variation is identified by a letter/number suffix after the name. Other jurisdictions do not have naming conventions, so Ontario's naming conventions are used in this article. The letter A designates that two ramps meet the freeway ahead of the arterial road, while B designates that two ramps meet the freeway beyond the crossing. The number designates how many quadrants of the interchange contain ramps. In left-hand drive countries, the ramps function the same as in right- hand drive countries, but ramps with the same designation appear visually reversed. Common parclo configurations include the parclo A2, parclo B2 and parclo A4. Configurations =A2 and B2= B2 configuration for right-hand traffic, or A2 for left-hand traffic. Also known as a folded diamond. Parclo A2 and B2 configurations contain four ramps. On each side of the freeway there is a loop ramp and a directional ramp. In parclo A2, the loop ramps serve as on-ramps and the directional ramps serve as off-ramps. In parclo B2 the roles are reversed. Both on- and off-ramps require controlled intersections at the arterial road (sometimes loop and directional ramps from the same side of the freeway will utilize the same intersection). The parclo A2 and B2 are commonly used on rural freeways such as Highway 402 and Highway 416, where the ramps can be added without widening the street overpass/underpass to include deceleration lanes (normally needed on the A4 in order to safely enter the loop ramps that lead to the freeway). The parclo A2 and B2 ramps are also usually longer and allow for higher speeds than their A4 counterparts because of rural land availability. It is possible to upgrade an A2 to an A4 by adding directional ramps, serving arterial-to-freeway traffic that would otherwise be forced to make a left turn to enter the loop ramps. =A4= A4 Interchange for right-hand traffic, or B4 interchange for left-hand traffic The parclo A4 (also called \\"six-ramp partial cloverleaf\\") contains six ramps.Six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchanges On each side on the freeway, there is an (often multi-lane) exit ramp, followed by a loop ramp and directional ramp entering the freeway. The on-ramps are in the same configuration as a cloverleaf interchange, but there is one off-ramp for each freeway direction instead of two, typically requiring a controlled intersection where the off- ramp meets the arterial road. The parclo A4 is one of the most popular designs, as all movements from the arterial road to the entrance ramps are made by right-hand turns, providing for a safer entrance to the freeway by eliminating left-hand turns into opposing traffic (which require queues waiting to make such turns). This also makes logical sense since freeways have a higher capacity than arterials and right-turn ramps serve effectively to absorb capacity and reduce traffic on the arterial. Some parclos have the right-turning (directional) on-ramp leave the arterial road after the exit ramp intersection. This configuration is often used when another road meets the freeway off-ramp and gives traffic from this road the option of turning right to use the directional on-ramp to enter the freeway. Traffic exiting the freeway to the arterial road is provided with a long, relatively straight exit ramp, preventing most speed-related rollovers. These exit ramps are also frequently multi-laned to accommodate traffic turning left, right, or going straight ahead in some cases. Traffic signals are commonly installed at the end of the exit ramp to regulate the freeway traffic flowing onto the arterial. The parclo A4 is particularly well-suited to suburban areas with high traffic levels. Ontario freeways throughout much of the southern portion of the province, especially freeways in the Golden Horseshoe and Ottawa area, use the A4 parclo. These interchanges also exist on some highways in the Montreal area. Caltrans favors this form for some recent projects, for example the reconstruction of I-880 and other highways in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area. They often replaced previous full cloverleafs. All exiting traffic for both directions has a relatively straight ramp and is controlled by a traffic light. Running off the road on an entering ramp is much less likely than on an exiting ramp. Metering lights are a common feature on the entering ramps. An A4 parclo at Saskatchewan Highway 1 (the Trans Canada Highway), Saskatchewan Highway 39 and Saskatchewan Highway 301. The eastbound directional onramp is located further south of the overpass and is not pictured. The junction of Saskatchewan Highway 1 (east-west), Saskatchewan Highway 39 (south, part of the CanAm route) and Saskatchewan Highway 301 (north) is an A4 parclo. Highway 1 serves as the freeway, while Highway 39/301 is the arterial road. =B4= The parclo B4 interchange superficially appears to be a mirror image of the parclo A4. However, the B4 design provides freeway-to-arterial ramps without traffic lights, while traffic turning left from the arterial must cross opposing traffic. Although this design has the potential to flood the arterial with more freeway traffic than the parclo A4, one particular advantage is the ability to coordinate the traffic signals on the arterial in both directions independently. This is useful when there is more through-movement traffic on the arterial than turning traffic. The parclo B4 is less common in Ontario than the parclo A4, with the only examples being the following: * Highway 402/Highway 40 interchange in Sarnia * the interchange at Lauzon Parkway and the E. C. Row Expressway in Windsor * Highway 17/Municipal Road 55 interchange in Sudbury * Highway 406/St. David's Road interchange on the border of St. Catharines and Thorold * Highway 400 and Dunlop street in Barrie (but this interchange is mandatory due to the angle the two roads meet at) There are two such interchanges in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, along Circle Drive, at College Drive and Attirdge Drive/Preston Avenue N. Three exist in British Columbia. In addition, the Solomon Pond Road interchange on I-290 in Northborough, Massachusetts, was converted from a B2 interchange to a B4 interchange in the mid-1990s with the construction of the Solomon Pond Mall. Also, the West Road interchange on I-75 in Woodhaven, Michigan, was upgraded from a B2 to a B4 in the mid 1980s after suburban sprawl had made the B2 interchange obsolete. The US 83 interchange on I-80 in North Platte, Nebraska, has also recently been upgraded to a B4 from a diamond. At least three B4 designs are known to exist in Kentucky: * The Taylorsville Road interchange with the Watterson Expressway in Louisville. The B4 design was necessary in this case because of the angle at which Taylorsville Road crosses the Watterson. * The US 127 interchange with Interstate 64 in Frankfort. * US 127 has a second B4 interchange at the Bluegrass Parkway near Lawrenceburg, about 15 miles (24 km) south of the I-64 crossing. This particular interchange is a conversion from a four-loop design at the location of one of the toll booths on the Bluegrass Parkway before its conversion into a freeway. Toll booths were located directly below US 127; through traffic used the through lanes, while both entering and exiting traffic shared a lane directly to the right of the through lanes. The old design was standard for interchanges at toll booths in Kentucky's parkway system of controlled-access toll roads; even though tolls have been removed from all of the roads, many of the old designs still exist at former toll booth sites. The following B4 interchanges were changed from full cloverleafs: * U.S. 14/U.S. 52 at Civic Center Drive in Rochester, Minnesota was changed from a cloverleaf in 2004/2005. * I-5 at South 38th Street in Tacoma, Washington was changed in the mid 1990s. * I-90/Ohio 2 at Ohio 57 near Elyria, Ohio was also changed in the mid 1990s. * U.S. 73/K-7 at U.S. 24/U.S. 40/State Avenue near Basehor, Kansas was changed in 2008. * I-695 at U.S. 40 in Catonsville, Maryland was changed in 2005/2006. A parclo B4 in south Calgary is subject to the traffic flooding problem on a daily basis. Traffic coming off the Macleod Trail freeway overwhelms Anderson Road, resulting significant delays and frequent accidents. The style of intersection was made necessary due to the presence of a small private cemetery in one quadrant of the interchange: under Alberta's Cemeteries Act burial sites cannot be seized. Some parclo B4 interchanges such as the intersection of Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 401 in Raleigh have been fitted with signals at each ramp meeting the arterial in order to allow more lanes on the offramps. This technique along with the ability to provide two-way signal progression along the arterial allows the parclo B4 to handle an extremely high flow of traffic along the arterial. =Other variations= A parclo AB2 interchange or folded diamond A parclo AB3 interchange (hybrid). Samples: The Laurensberg interchange in Aachen, Germany and US 74/NC 51 interchange near Matthews, North Carolina Parclo designs with only two quadrants are commonly referred to as folded diamonds, due to their similarity with diamond interchanges. Sometimes the ramps in a folded diamond are actually local streets; surface roads upgraded to higher standards often do this to save money on land acquisition. This type of interchange long predates the parclo; the Merritt Parkway and Queen Elizabeth Way, both built in the 1930s, used mainly folded diamonds and cloverleaves. Another example of this is Highway 401's interchange with Highway 2 east of Tilbury (Exit 63): the ramps also have intersections fairly close to the freeway to allow traffic to continue on a rural country road (Jeannette's Creek Road / McKinlay Road) which formerly met Highway 2. Depending on traffic and land needs, hybrid designs, such as the parclo AB and parclo A3, can be created. A notable example of a parclo AB interchange includes the Highway 417 and the Woodroffe Avenue interchange in Ottawa. Other variants, not describable using Ontario's system, eliminate one or more outside ramps, while leaving the loop ramps in those quadrants. In the United States, folded diamonds are frequently used in interchanges with roads that have a railroad line closely paralleling the surface street; entrance/exit ramps are not permitted to have level crossings in modern American practice.. Freeway-to-freeway interchanges A parclo bears a superficial resemblance to the cloverleaf interchanges used for freeway traffic. The cloverleaf has a full four loops and is fully grade separated as opposed to the parclo with just two loops and being only partially grade separated. Ramps and loops of cloverleaf intersections also are often longer to allow for higher speeds. In particular the loop ramp radii are enlarged to allow a recommended instead of . Cloverstack interchanges (cross between cloverleaf and stack interchanges) can also resemble a parclo. These also are fully grade separated and allow for higher capacities than can be handled with a cloverleaf interchange. Implementation An Autobahn parclo interchange variation in Germany. The Nesselwang interchange on Autobahn 7 In California, Caltrans currently has a policy that whenever cloverleaf interchanges between freeways and surface streets are being rebuilt, they are turned into parclo interchanges by removing some of the loop ramps (or in rare cases bridges will be added between adjacent loop ramps‚Äîsee cloverleaf interchange for details). Various forms of parclo interchanges are used on the North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines. The configuration of parclo interchanges (particularly those of the \\"folded diamond\\" type) allows for the consolidation of toll barriers at points where onramps and offramps run alongside each other. A single large barrier can serve each onramp/offramp pair simultaneously, reducing construction and operation expenses at through junctions. When possible, such as at terminal junctions, trumpet interchanges are preferred since they only require one large toll barrier for all four on/off-ramps.

The crank is turned with the right hand. Curt Herzstark (July 26, 1902 ‚Äì October 27, 1988) was an Austrian engineer. During World War II, he designed plans for a mechanical pocket calculator (the Curta). Life and career Herzstark was born in Vienna, the son of Marie and Samuel Jakob Herzstark. His father was Jewish and his mother, born a Catholic, converted to Lutheranism and raised Herzstark Lutheran.http://wvegter.hivemind.net/abacus/CyberHeroes/Herzstark.htm In 1938, while he was technical manager of his father's company Rechenmaschinenwerk AUSTRIA Herzstark & Co., Herzstark had already completed the design of the Curta, but could not manufacture it due to the Nazi German annexation of Austria. Instead, the company was ordered to make measuring devices for the German Army. In 1943, perhaps influenced by the fact that his father was a liberal Jew, the Nazis arrested him for \\"helping Jews and subversive elements\\" and \\"indecent contacts with Aryan women\\" and sent him to the Buchenwald concentration camp. However, the reports of the army about the precision- production of the firm AUSTRIA and especially about the technical expertise of Herzstark led the Nazis to treat him as an \\"intelligence-slave\\". His imprisonment at Buchenwald seriously threatened his health, but his condition improved when he was called to work in the factory linked to the camp, which was named after Wilhelm Gustloff. There he was ordered to make a drawing of the construction of his calculator, so that the Nazis could ultimately give the machine to the F√ºhrer as a gift after the successful end of the war. The preferential treatment this allowed ensured that he survived his stay at Buchenwald until the camp's liberation in 1945, by which time he had redrawn the complete construction from memory. Herzstark died in Nendeln, Liechtenstein. The Curta is referenced in chapter four of William Gibson's Pattern Recognition. The chapter is entitled 'Math Grenades', referring to protagonist Cayce Pollard mistaking them for hand grenades at first glance.

Modern news employs these trucks extensively. On location outside Baltimore, cameraman Jim Furrer, sound recordist Bill Porter, and director David Ryan interview participants in a public rowing clinic as part of an early electronic journalism shoot in the 1980s. Electronic news-gathering (ENG) is when reporters and editors make use of electronic video and audio technologies in order to gather and present news. ENG can involve anything from a single reporter with a single professional video camera, to an entire television crew taking a truck on location. This term was coined during the rise of videotape technology in the 1970s. This term was commonly used in the television news in the 1980s and '90s, but is used less frequently now, as the technology has become commonplace. The vehicle on which the electronic equipment is fitted it is called DSNG (digital satellite news gathering). Beginnings =Shortcomings of film= The term ENG was created as television news departments moved from film-based news-gathering to electronic field production technology in the 1970s. Since film requires chemical processing before it can be viewed and edited, it generally took at least an hour from the time the film arrived back at the television station or network news department until it was ready to be broadcast. Film Editing was done by hand on what was known as \\"color reversal\\" film, usually Kodak Ektachrome, meaning there were no negatives. Color reversal film had replaced black-and-white film as television itself evolved from black-and-white to color broadcasting. Filmo cameras were most commonly used for silent filming, while Auricon cameras were used for filming with synchronized sound. Since editing required cutting the film into segments and then splicing them together, a common problem was film breaking during the newscast. News stories were often transferred to bulky 2-inch videotape for distribution and playback, which made the content cumbersome to access. Film remained important in daily news operations until the late 1960s, when news outlets adopted portable professional video cameras, portable recorders, wireless microphones and joined those with various microwave- and satellite truck-linked delivery systems. By the mid-1980s, film had all but disappeared from use in television journalism. =Transition to ENG= ABS- CBN.thumbleft200px As one cameraman of the era tells it, This portability greatly contributed to the rise of electronic news gathering as it made portable news more easily accessible than ever before. Early portable video systems recorded at a lower quality than broadcast studio cameras, which made them less desirable than non portable video systems. When the Portapak video camera was introduced in 1967, it was a new method of video recording, forever shifting ENG. By the time videotape technology advanced, the capability for microwave transmission was well established (and used in the 1960s by the BBC's ill-fated Mobile Film Processing Unit). But the convenience of videotape finally allowed crews to more easily use microwave links to quickly send their footage back to the studio. It even made live feeds more possible, as in the police shootout with the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974. Also in 1974, KMOX, a station in St. Louis, Mo., was the first to abandon film and switch entirely to ENG. Stations all over the country made the switch over the next decade. ENG greatly reduces the delay between when the footage is captured and when it can be broadcast, thus enabling news gathering and reporting to become steady cycle with little time in between when story breaks and when a story can air. Coupled with live microwave and/or satellite trucks, reporters were able to show live what was happening, bringing the audience into news events as they happened.Television broadcast crews line up on a San Diego dock awaiting arrival of USS Vandegrift (FFG-48) crew after the sea rescue of the Kaufman family, 2014 CNN launched in June 1980, as ENG technologies were emerging. The technology was still in its developmental stages, and had yet to be integrated with satellites and microwave relays, which caused some problems with the network's early transmissions. However, ENG proved to be a crucial development for all television news as news content recorded using videocassette recorders was easier to edit, duplicate and distribute. Over time, as editing technology has become simpler and more accessible, video production processes have largely passed from broadcast engineers to producers and writers, making the process quicker. However, initially the ENG cameras and recorders were heavier and bulkier than their film equivalents.Live from the Trenches: The Changing Role of the Television News Correspondent by Joe S. Foote, 1998, This restricted the ability of camera operators from escaping danger or hurrying toward a news event. Editing equipment was expensive and each scene had to be searched out on the master recording. Technology developments Using technology such as multicast or RTP over UDP, these systems achieve similar performance to high end-microwave. Since the video stream is already encoded for IP, the video can be used for traditional television broadcast or Internet distribution without modification (live to air). As mobile broadband has developed, broadcast devices using this technology have appeared. These devices are often more compact than previous technology and can aggregate multiple mobile data lines to deliver a high definition-quality content live. Broadcast video equipment Easyrig Inventor Johan Hellsten with DP Mark Schulze wearing Easyrig at NAB 2015The ongoing Technological evolution of broadcast video production equipment can be observed annually at the NAB Show in Las Vegas where equipment manufacturers gather to display their wares to people within the video production industry. The trend is toward lighter-weight equipment that can deliver more resolution at higher speeds. There has been an evolution from Film to Standard-definition television, High-definition television and now 4K. Video production on Carlsbad beach using Sony FS7 camera, Sachtler carbon fiber tripod and Convergent Design Odyssey 7Q+ monitorAs of 2016, highlights included Unmanned aerial vehicles aka drones for the delivery of aerial footage, various lines of cameras that can deliver 4K resolution, graphics packages for news stations, which can be utilized inside their microwave and/or satellite vehicles, Wireless technology, POV cameras and peripherals from GoPro and other Action camera manufacturers, and the Odyssey 7Q+ monitor with Apollo multi-camera switcher/recorder from Convergent Design. This monitor fits on the back of a broadcast video camera and allows photojournalists to live- switch a multi-camera production in studio or on location. Outside broadcasts Outside broadcasts (also known as \\"remote broadcasts\\" and \\"field operations\\") are when the editing and transmission of the news story are done outside the station's headquarters. Use of ENG has made possible the greater use of outside broadcasts.How \\"Electronic News Gathering\\" Came to Be, by Frank Beacham, TV News Check, March 7, 2014, http://www.tvnewscheck.com/playout/2014/03/how-electronic-news-gathering-came- to-be/ \\"Some stations have always required reporters to shoot their own stories, interviews and even standup reports and then bring that material back to the station where the video is edited for that evening's newscast.

Use of these channels is restricted by federal regulations to those holding broadcast licenses in the given market. Channels 1 through 7 are in the 2 GHz band and channels 8, 9 and 10 are in the 2¬Ω GHz band. In Atlanta for example, there are two channels each for the four news-producing television stations (WSB-TV, WAGA-TV, WXIA-TV, WGCL-TV), one for CNN, and another open for other users on request, such as Georgia Public Broadcasting. Traditionally, the Federal Communications Commission has assigned microwave spectrum based on historic patterns of need and through the application/request process. With the other uses of radio spectrum growing in the 1990s, the FCC made available some bands of spectrum as unlicensed channels. This included spectrum for cordless phones and Wi-Fi. As a result, some of these channels have been used for news gathering by websites and more informal news outlets. One major disadvantage of unlicensed use is that there is no frequency coordination, which can result in interference or blocking of signals. Audio journalism A common set-up for journalists is a battery operated cassette recorder with a dynamic microphone and optional telephone interface. With this set-up, the reporter can record interviews and natural sound and then transmit these over the phone line to the studio or for live broadcast. Electronic formats used by journalists have included DAT, MiniDisc, CD and DVD. Minidisc has digital indexing and is re-recordable, reusable medium; while DAT has SMPTE timecode and other synchronization features. In recent years, more and more journalists have used smartphones or iPod-like devices for recording short interviews. The other alternative is using small field recorders with two condenser microphones.

Stromberg was portrayed by Curd J√ºrgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl that is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used. Biography The webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is \\"Sigmund\\". =Scheme= Although Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the \\"surface world\\". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are \\"buried at sea\\".) This scheme is similar to that of a previous film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman. =Prevention= Stromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis. Bond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea. =Henchmen= *Jaws - survived *Naomi - blown up by Bond *Sandor - thrown off the edge of a building by Bond *Liparus Captain - fatally wounded by an explosion *A small army of red soldiers See also *List of James Bond villains *James Bond in film References Category:Bond villains Category:Fictional German people Category:Fictional Swedish people Category:James Bond characters Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional dictators Category:Fictional warlords Category:The Spy Who Loved Me (film) Category:Film characters introduced in 1977 Category:Fictional terrorists Category:Male literary villains Category:Male film villains Category:Action film villains ","title":"Karl Stromberg"},{"id":"1248081","text":"A Million Open Doors (1992) is a science fiction novel by American writer John Barnes, the first book of his Thousand Cultures series. The story is told from the perspective of a maturing adult from a parochial culture who encounters many obstacles in a different and even more parochial culture which causes him to become a fully engaged citizen in the Interstellar culture. A Million Open Doors is a study of the effects of globalization. The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1992 and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1994. Plot summary The story begins sometime in the 29th century on the planet Wilson (orbiting Arcturus) with a young man named Giraut and his romantic, swashbuckling friends, who are all members of the Nou Occitan culture and residents in the Quartier de Jovents, a sort of playground for teens and twenty-somethings who have not yet moved on to the more \\"grown-up\\" lifestyle of their parents. Technologically safeguarded, these young adults have swordfights in the streets with \\"neuroducer\\" √©p√©es and frequent the taverns of the Quartier, living in an imaginative recreation of Occitan literature and the trobador tradition. However, Giraut is forced to grow up much more quickly than most of his friends, because one day his friend Aimeric, who was, before coming to Wilson and becoming a jovent, an economist in the Caledon culture of the nearest inhabited planet, Nansen (orbiting Mufrid), is called upon by the government to return to his home planet on a mission to regulate the effects of the springer on Caledonian economy. The springer is a method of instantaneous transportation which is quickly reuniting humanity across known space. Giraut decides to leave when he catches his girlfriend getting into the Interstellar \\"arts scene\\" (the art is called \\"sadoporn\\") which is an acting out against the exclusive values and code of honor valued by Giraut and his friends. Thus, Aimeric and Giraut advise the rational council of the Caledonians to adjust their economy to that of the rest of the universe so that the springer will have as few adverse effects as possible. When the Caledonians decide that Aimeric and Giraut, as well as the Interstellar government, are trying to usurp their power, they begin to try to seize back control of everything, and an urban conflict ensues. Giraut discovers among the strife who he really is and begins to see how fake his life back home was, and recognize faults in his home culture. Characters * Giraut - a talented Nou Occitan swordsman and song writer forced to grow up suddenly as he encounters complicated political struggles between opposing ideological groups as an assistant on Aimeric's mission to planet Nansen. * Garsenda - Giraut's ex-girlfriend back in Nou Occitan. * Aimeric - originally from Caledony, a fellow troubadour and friend to Giraut, trained in economic principles and business and ambassador for the Council of Humanity to Caledony people on Nansen. * Bieris - Aimeric's girlfriend, who accompanies him to Nansen. * Bruce - Aimeric's childhood friend from Nansen, who greets and initially hosts them upon their arrival on the harsh planet. * Margaret - a Caledony woman who becomes increasingly important to Giraut. Planets referenced * Earth (central planet for humanity, in the Inner Sphere) * Nansen (home of Caledony and St. Michael, in the Outer Sphere and recently contacted) * Wilson (home of Nou Occitan, close to the Outer Sphere and contacted years ago) Literary significance & criticism This novel is a commentary on globalization via a fictional account of the effects of the Earth's expanding political, economic and social influence over human inhabited planets. Barnes suggests that those most harmed by globalization are the ones least willing to change in response.

The remaining Mi'kmaq live off-reserve in the eastern United States and across Canada, but stay connected to the community through modern communications and travel to Listuguj for annual events such as the salmon harvest in June, St. Ann's Day in July, or the traditional powwow in August. All community members, regardless of residence, participate in democratic elections held every two years to elect one Chief and twelve Councillors in accordance with Canada's Indian Act Election Regulations, however only community members with residence in Listuguj could participate in the Ratification Vote for the Settlement Agreement which took place on December 13, 2014.listuguj.ca: \\"Listuguj ‚Äì Canada Settlement Agreement\\" The community is also allied to other Mi'gmaq communities in the Gasp√© region of Quebec and in northern New Brunswick. Together, their elected Chiefs advance ancestral claims to self-government and to the traditional territory called Gespe'gewa'gi ('Kesp√©kew√°ki), the last land. Gespe'gewa'gi is the Mi'gmaq Nation District that extends from the Miramichi River to the tip of the Gasp√© Peninsula, a land area that straddles the modern day Quebec/New Brunswick border. The First Nation is a strong advocate of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, and Aboriginal and treaty rights. Its main resource is the Atlantic salmon and other fruits of the waters and forests, including modern harvest of timber. Political representatives of the Mi'gmaq of Listuguj and the greater district of Gespe'gewa'gi continue talks with the Government of Quebec over access to traditional lands.  Battle of the Restigouche (1760) The \\"Battle of the Restigouche\\", was the last naval battle between the British and the French during the Seven Years' War. In 1760, after the fall of Quebec, the French hurried to send reinforcements across the Atlantic. 400 troops were sent in merchant ships from Bordeaux. However, when they reached the Saint Lawrence River, the fleet commander discovered that the area was already occupied by a strong British fleet. He decided to sail south to the bottom of the Bay of Chaleur, and established gun batteries on the shore of the Restigouche River, near Listuguj. Eventually, they were spotted by British Captain John Byron, who engaged battle there. The battle opposed 3 French ships and ground batteries and a coalition of Mi'gmaq, French and Acadian irregular troops, against a 70-gun British ship and 2 frigates. The French and their allies lost this battle, ending the hopes of reconquering Quebec. 1981 Salmon Raid On June 11 and 20, 1981, the Quebec Provincial Police conducted controversial raids on the reserve to stop the Mi'gmaq from asserting their control over their native fishery. Federal Indian Affairs Minister John Munro was among those critical of the manner in which the Quebec government and provincial minister Lucien Lessard had acted. All convictions resulting from the arrests were eventually overturned. The raids and their aftermath were documented by Alanis Obomsawin in her 1984 film Incident at Restigouche.

Drafting happens at any stage of the writing process as writers generate trial versions of the text they're developing. At the phrasal level, these versions may last less than a second, as writers compose and then delete trial sentences; as fully fleshed out attempts, draft documents may last for perpetuity as saved \\"versions\\" or as paper files in archives. While drafting, writers may be * developing a more cohesive text * organizing thoughts * experimenting with phrasing * explaining or linking examples/ideas * generating transitions * discovering a central argument/point * elaborating on key ideas In a book that became popular in the 1950s, The Elements of Style, famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft. In their book, Strunk and White say, ‚Äúthe first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, ‚Äù This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work. More recently, Peter Elbow, in his book Writing Without Teachers, presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the writing process. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying ‚ÄúWriting is a way to end up thinking something you couldn‚Äôt have started out thinking.Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15‚Äù According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging ‚Äúcenter of gravity‚Äù that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbow's reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, ‚Äúif he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didn‚Äôt seem available to him.Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50‚Äù Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process. Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

The station is currently owned by BJ & Skip's for the Music. The foundation is a 501(c)3 organization, so donations are tax deductible. It is dedicated to the preservation of the music of the first half of the 20th century. It is a daytimer station, signing on at sunrise and signing off at local sunset to protect KNBR in San Francisco, California. As of May 2014, KBRD programming can also be heard 24 hours a day on KCFL FM 89.5 in the Westport-Aberdeen, Washington, area. History The station was assigned the call letters KNTE on March 7, 1994. On October 7, 1994, the station changed its call sign to KLDY then again on February 17, 1995, to the current KBRD. Larry \\"Skip\\" Morrow owned an FM radio station but was interested in also owning an AM station. When he purchased what was to become KBRD, there wasn't enough radio equipment to go on the air. He was also interested in the KBRD call letters; when the station was ready to go on the air, they belonged to someone else, so the station signed on under his ownership as KLDY. When KBRD became available, Morrow transferred the KLDY callsign to his classical AM station at 1280, making 680 KBRD. KBRD was named for BJ, Morrow's Moluccan cockatoo. who was the \\"music director\\". If BJ danced to the music, it was put on KBRD's playlist. Morrow ran both KBRD and his FM radio station from his living room. Ten years after KBRD went on the air, Larry Morrow died of cancer; before his death, he transferred ownership of the radio station to a foundation he created: BJ and Skip's for The Music Foundation. Morrow's network of friends maintain the radio station with the help of the foundation. Format Although officially described as a \\"nostalgia\\" station, KBRD plays an eclectic mixture of jazz, rock, swing, country, dixieland, ragtime, zydeco, western swing, novelty and other music, much of which can be heard nowhere else in the country. A typical hour broadcast on KBRD might contain music by Artie Shaw, Aunt Dinah's Quilting Party, Bessie Smith, Boots Randolph, Clicquot Club Eskimos, Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers, Bing Crosby, the Harmonicats, Sheb Wooley, Marty Robbins, Jelly Roll Morton, Nat King Cole, the Korn Kobblers, George Formby, Nana Mouskouri, Perry Como, Merle Travis, Louis Armstrong and the ever-popular Hoosier Hot Shots.

It is the center of Gabon's petroleum and timber industries. The city is located on a delta island in the Ogooue delta with no bridges to the mainland. Nearby Cape Lopez is Gabon's westernmost point. It had a 2013 census population of 136,462.  History  In 1473, the Portuguese navigator Lopo Gon√ßalves sailed near Cape Lopez.Britannica, Port-Gentil, britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019 In 1722, pirates led by Bartholomew Roberts fought a battle in the Cape Lopez Bay against the Royal Navy. The encounter ended in Roberts' death. The settlement was established on Mandji Island in the delta of the Ogoou√© River by the French, who signed a treaty with the Orungu people in 1873. It was used as a base for the expeditions of de Brazza into the interior, then in 1894 a customs post was set up, becoming the nucleus of a trading center that included Hatton & Cookson, John Holt, Woermann, Soci√©t√© du Haut-Ogoou√©, and Compagnie d'Exploitations Foresti√®res Africaines. The main products were initially rubber and ivory, gradually supplemented by woods, particularly okoum√© for plywood. A street in Port-Gentil The town was named after the French colonial administrator √âmile Gentil in 1900. After World War I it became a port for timber, but it grew rapidly only after Elf began oil exploration in the area. It received its first bank branch when Bank of West Africa (BAO) opened a branch there in 1928. A 1947 population of 4,500 grew to 21,000 by 1960. An oil refinery was established by SOGARA in the 1960s, with natural gas added in 1968. The town is now known for its hotels and its nightlife, while attractions include the St Louis Church (built in 1927), a zoo, a casino, beaches and a golf course, as well as the wildlife in local swamps. City districts The city centre lies next to the harbour on the Port-Gentil Bay seaside. Hotels, banks, shops, and supermarkets (such as the Casino and Cecado brands) are found within the downtown area between the Avenue Savorgnan de Brazzaville and the seaside. The area also concentrates a residential compound for foreign workforce. In the southern part, the BEAC building lies next to the port. The western Atlantic seaside is scarcely populated, mainly due to the presence of strong winds and sea currents. As is the case with other cities in Gabon, the authorities have not yet implemented house numbering in Port-Gentil, and the use of postal boxes is common. Climate The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Port- Gentil's climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw). Despite the fact that the city lies in close proximity to the equator, Port-Gentil experiences noticeably warmer and cooler periods of the year with average temperatures in July (the city's coolest month) hovering at around and average temperatures in February and March (the city's warmest months) at around . Port-Gentil features a lengthy wet season that runs from October through May and a relatively short dry season that covers the remaining four months. The city receives roughly of precipitation annually. The highest recorded temperature was on 26 February 2016; the lowest recorded temperature was on 1 August 1953. Transportation The airport in Port-Gentil Port Gentil is technically on an island, and no bridge connects it to the mainland. The limited number of paved roads within the city are also poorly maintained. The roads are paved in the inner city up to the outskirts of the new residential districts in N'Tchengue, where sandy paths with frequent potholes prevail. Traffic jams are common in road junctions such as the Carrefour Tobia or L√©on Mba, close to the downtown area. There are plenty of shared taxi services for which the price of a drive is negotiable, starting usually at 400 CFA Francs. The taxi fare usually doubles for night drives. A premium price (doubled fare) is requested for passengers travelling beyond paved roads, given the hardships of the road, lack or non existence of illuminated roads at night, or pedestrians randomly walking on the road. Most of the cars are obsolete given the prohibitively high cost of new imported cars. Furthermore, the lack of local car spareparts manufacturers underscores the need to import such parts from as far as Europe, the increased price as well as the lengthy delivery duration penalize altogether the traffic. The city has an airport, Port-Gentil International Airport, serving as the main channel of transportation with the world. Regular flights connect it with Libreville, capital of Gabon. Healthcare Hospitals within Port- Gentil include: * Clinique Mandji, located in the Littoral district on the Route de la Sobraga, * Clinique du Littoral, located on the Boulevard du Gouverneur P√©lieu, * Centre du Traitement Ambulatoire on the road to N'Tchengue.

He was born Clement Anderson Barlow at St Bartholomew's Vicarage, Clifton, Gloucestershire, and preferred to be known under his second name, Anderson, rather than his first, Clement. He received a Master's degree and an LL.D. from the University of Cambridge and practised at the bar. Between 1910 and 1923 he represented Salford South in the House of Commons. In 1922 he was admitted to the Privy Council upon becoming Minister of Labour, a position he served in until 1924. He was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1918 and in 1924 he was created a baronet, of Westminster in the County of London. In 1938, Neville Chamberlain's government asked Barlow to chair a royal commission into the urban concentration of population and industry, \\"The Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population\\", which became known as the Barlow Commission.The National Archives: Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population (Barlow Commission): Minutes and Papers Linked 2015-05-30 Its report, published in 1940, raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time, and concluded that \\"planned decentralisation\\" was favourable. The report was largely ignored at the time, as it came shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, but its conclusions were a major factor behind the new towns movement after the war, which led to the creation of 27 new towns.

This may be done either virtually or physically. That is, it may be shown this way only in the documentation and the actual circuit may look nothing like that; or it may be laid out that way on the physical chip. Typically, separate lanes are used for the inverted inputs and are tapped separately. The name Manhattan wiring comes from looking at such a circuit diagram. It is reminiscent of how the roads in Manhattan, New York tend to criss-cross in a very regular grid. Manhattan wiring is often used to represent a programmable logic array.

It operates 24 hours a day with a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 10,000 watts from a transmitter in Mercer Slough Nature Park in Bellevue, where studios are also located (although in a separate location). Format KIXI features nostalgic music, such as big band and musical standards. It is the only station in the Seattle area to feature the Imagination Theatre and Twilight Zone radio dramas. KIXI remains one of the few AM radio stations that continues to successfully program music on the AM band. It also enjoys some of the highest ratings of any \\"Nostalgia\\" formatted station in the US. On June 1, 2006, KIXI started to carry the nationally syndicated format Music of Your Life format from Jones Radio Networks. Jones stopped carrying Music of Your Life via satellite in January 2008 in favor of its own standards format, called \\"Jones Standards\\" (which has since been discontinued and absorbed into Dial Global's America's Best Music network). However, KIXI remained until April 2009 an affiliate of Music of Your Life, now distributed by Planet Halo, Incorporated. The station was the first AM station in Seattle to transmit its signal in IBOC digital radio during a joint demonstration with Harris Corporation and iBiquity, the licensee of the new digital AM transmission method. KIXI can also be heard in HD Radio on KRWM 106.9 FM HD2. History KIXI took the air in 1947 as KXRN, a 250-Watt Renton station broadcasting at 1220 kHz during daytime hours only. KXRN was owned by the Interlake Broadcasting Company. It was built by Frank C. Cook, who was also the radio announcer. In 1951, the station moved to 1230 kHz and changed its call letters to KLAN a year later. KLAN became a full-time station broadcasting with 1,000 Watts at 910 kHz in 1957. Purchased the following year by former KRSC and KJR personality Wally Nelskog, the station became top-40 KQDE, or \\"Cutie Radio.\\" A sister station on 1230 kHz in Everett, KQTY, also used the same branding. One of Seattle's first black deejays, Bob Summarise, brought an R&B; influence to his airshift on KQDE. (Summarise would later own soul-formatted KYAC, which took the air in 1964.) In 1960, KQDE would change its call letters to the more phonetic KUDY and changed its city of license to Seattle. Failing to make an impact in the top-40 battle dominated by KJR and KOL, the station became beautiful music KIXI in late 1961. (The call letters were a Roman numeral representation of the station's \\"9-1\\" dial position.) Bob Liddle, formerly of Portland, Oregon stations KXL and KEX, joined the airstaff and would stay with KIXI for 45 years. During the 1970s, Liddle teamed with Dean Smith on News 90, one of Seattle's first all-news morning drive programs. A partnership led by J. Elroy McCaw, owner of Tacoma television station KTVW and father of future cellular telephone tycoon Craig McCaw, purchased a 50-percent interest in KIXI in 1963. The group also acquired FM beautiful music station KGMJ from Rogan Jones, founder of the pioneering radio automation firm IGM. KGMJ became KIXI-FM and simulcasted the AM station's programming. McCaw died suddenly of a stroke in 1969, exposing a considerable amount of debt accumulated from his speculation on radio and television stations, including WINS in New York and KYA in San Francisco. With the exception of a small cable television system in Centralia, McCaw's entire broadcasting portfolio was sold off to pay down the debt service. Wally Nelskog and two Richland physicians purchased KIXI and KIXI-FM in 1971. The beautiful music simulcast ended in 1980, with the AM side adopting an oldies format and the FM station programming adult contemporary as \\"KIXI Lite.\\" A move to the 880 kHz frequency a year later allowed for a daytime power boost to 50,000 watts, and in 1986, a nighttime increase to 10,000 watts. With the move, KIXI (AM) began running a satellite-fed adult standards format. That same year, Nelskog sold the station to Thunder Bay Communications. In December 1987, the group sold the AM station to Sunbelt Communications, while the FM station, which had become KLTX, was sold to Ackerley.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Mediatrix/Mediatrix- Seattle-1986.pdf KIXI was purchased by Sandusky Radio, owners of KLSY, in November 1991. Hiring personalities such as Jim Dai and Dan Murphy in 1993, the station dropped the AM Only satellite service for a locally voicetracked lineup. Bob Dearborn, best known for his work at WCFL in Chicago, was the KIXI program director from 1994 to 1999. He was replaced by Bob Brooks, formerly of KLSY. While the aging demographics of the adult standards audience forced many stations in larger markets to drop the format in the late 1990s, KIXI continued to enjoy modest success, often selling advertising time as an \\"add- on\\" to spots on KLSY or the other stations in the Sandusky Seattle group. Finally, in a move that led to an outcry from a loyal listener base, KIXI abruptly began airing Music of Your Life satellite programming on June 1, 2006. With the exception of Dan Murphy, who continued to voice station promotions and weekday weather forecasts, the entire KIXI airstaff was terminated. In April 2009, KIXI dropped the Music of Your Life programming after three years and returned to local programming. However, the station is now largely voicetracked and automated - with total operations being overseen by Dan Murphy. In July 2013, Sandusky announced it would sell its radio holdings in Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona to Hubbard Broadcasting. The sale was completed that November.

The original two-story brick building, constructed specifically for the station on East 14th Street, was demolished sometime in the 1980s.) KGO was part of a planned three-station network comprising WGY in Schenectady, New York, and KOA in Denver, Colorado. KGO was first known as the \\"Sunset Station\\" since it was General Electric's West Coast outlet. At that time it operated with a then-impressive 1000 watts.\\"Open Station KGO at Oakland.\\" Decatur IL Review, February 9, 1924, p. 23; also, \\"New KGO Will Open Tomorrow.\\" Oakland Tribune, January 8, 1924, p. 15. As was the custom with early radio stations, the programming consisted of performances by local talent, including the KGO Orchestra which provided some of the music, and a dramatic group known as the KGO Players, which performed weekly plays and short skits, often under the direction of Bay-area drama instructor Wilda Wilson Church. The station's music, which was also performed by other local orchestras and vocalists, included classical selections as well as popular dance music the next night. Due to GE's involvement in RCA and RCA's launch of the NBC Red Network, KGO was soon operated by NBC management out of studio facilities in San Francisco. See the KNBR entry for a fuller discussion of NBC's San Francisco radio operations. In order to make its Schenectady outlet a clear channel station, GE effected a breakdown of 790 kHz. WGY would assume the maximum permissible power, and KGO would be lowered in power to 7,500 watts. That was then lower than the minimum permissible power for a clear channel station (10 kW), and also was then higher than the then maximum permissible power for a regional channel station (5 kW). Both stations retained omnidirectional antennas. Therefore, GE effectively removed from the West one of its eight clear channels and added another clear channel to the East, thereby giving the East nine cleared channels and the West only seven. The other \\"regions\\" in the Band Plan all retained their allotted eight cleared channels. =1940s and 50s= In 1941, stations on 790, including WGY and KGO, were moved to 810 to comply with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). On December 1, 1947, KGO switched to a directional antenna and its power was increased to 50,000 watts, the new minimum standard power for a U.S. clear channel station. An article in Broadcasting magazine noted that the increase \\"retired the nation's oldest regularly operating transmitter-a 7,500-watter ... in use since Jan. 8, 1924.\\" When the Federal Communications Commission forced NBC to sell one of its two networks (and that network's owned-and-operated stations), KGO's license switched from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc., effective January 23, 1942. The NBC Blue Network simply dropped \\"NBC\\" from its name to become the \\"Blue Network,\\" then in June 1945 re-branded itself the American Broadcasting Company. KGO became one of the founding stations of the ABC Radio Network as a result. In the postwar period, KGO produced many live music programs, including that of Western Swing bandleader Bob Wills, whose music was a staple of the time. KGO was instrumental in bringing the first exercise show to broadcasting, hosted by Jack LaLanne, a fitness instructor and gym operator in nearby Oakland. LaLanne conducted his radio fitness show for many years on KGO, moving in the late 1950s to KGO-TV and a successful TV syndication career. By the late 1950s, KGO had suffered poor ratings. In 1962, ABC management brought in new management including program director Jim Dunbar, who revamped the station into one of the country's first news/talk stations. While the new format was initially unsuccessful, Dunbar stressed the \\"live and local\\" aspect of the programming by running the talk shows every day from locations such as Johnny Kan's Chinese restaurant, Se√±or Pico's Restaurant, and the legendary hungry i nightclub. This higher profile caused KGO's ratings to begin a steady climb. Among KGO's personalities during this period was future Radio Hall of Fame member J.P. McCarthy, the station's morning host in the early 1960s. =1960s‚Äì1980s= After trying various formats, KGO eventually shifted to news and talk programming, relying heavily on the ABC radio network for its news programs. KGO started carrying Paul Harvey's twice-daily programs but also began to develop a strong local news staff that produced extended morning and afternoon newscasts. The local talk show hosts included Les Crane, Owen Spann and Jim Eason, who often interviewed visiting celebrities in the KGO studios. Owen Spann also originated special broadcasts from Europe and Africa, interviewing government officials from those countries. Local director-actor Jack Brooks hosted a Saturday-morning entertainment program until his sudden death in June 1984, after directing a production of Kismet for the Capuchino Community Theatre that featured Jim Eason as the poet Omar Khayy√°m. Dr. Dean Edell began his regular medical programs at KGO, leading to nationally syndicated broadcasts. =Ratings and signal strength= KGO logo during the 1990s. For more than 27 years (as rated quarterly by Arbitron), KGO was the number-one station in the Bay Area. According to the 2010 Arbitron ratings, however, KGO had lost its lead to KCBS, with KOIT-FM as a close second, and KGO listing at third. When KGO switched to all-news in December 2011, it fell further behind in the local ratings. As of Spring 2013, KGO placed 16th in the market, with approximately half of their listenership when they were number one. KGO logo from 2000 to 2011. The KGO signal also registers with Arbitron as a station listened to in surrounding metropolitan areas. Due to the nature of its signal and antenna placement, KGO broadcasts on a north-to-south axis, keeping itself from interfering with WGY (Schenectady, New York) during the night-time and overnight hours when the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts. KGO's signal is received essentially free of static at night in locations such as Vancouver, Washington, Seattle, Washington and San Diego, but is difficult to receive in Reno, Nevada, and other points east of the Sierra Nevada mountains due to its signal directionality. That said, its overall reach is greater than any FM signal in the Bay Area (according to radio-locator.com map referenced below). =1990s-2010s= KGO Helicopter. Until December 5, 2011, KGO created nearly all of its own local programming, with very limited syndicated content. The majority of its programs were hosted by San Francisco Bay Area broadcasters. The daily schedule included many issues-oriented talk shows, with weekday hosts that included Gene Burns, Gil Gross, Ronn Owens, John Rothmann and lawyer Len Tillem. The station also carried a variety of specialty programs, particularly on weekends, with John Hamilton discussing travel and leisure, Gene Burns covering fine food and dining (on a show separate from his weekday program), Joanie Greggains hosting a health-and- fitness program, and Brent Walters, who teaches \\"Comparative Religions\\" at San Jose State University, hosting the early Sunday morning show, God Talk. In 2014, KGO brought in John Batchelor at midnight. News/talk weekend hosts now include Brian Copeland, \\"Karel\\" Charles Karel Bouley, and Pat Thurston. The weekday morning news (from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m.) is currently co-anchored by Jon Bristow and Jennifer Jones-Lee. The afternoon news (from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.) currently features veteran reporter Chris Brecher and award-winning reporter/anchor Bret Burkhart. On Friday, December 2, 2011, new owner Cumulus Media announced that KGO was rebranding itself as \\"news and information,\\" moving to an all-news format from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. (in addition to the existing morning-drive, noon-hour and afternoon-drive news blocks) on December 5. This had resulted in the abrupt termination, on December 1, of most of the talk hosts (including Gene Burns, Gil Gross, John Rothmann, Ray Taliaferro, Len Tillem, and Dr. Bill Wattenburg). Ronn Owens's morning show, as well as weekend talk programming remained, although some of the weekend hosts (including Joanie Greggains, and Len Tillem) were also terminated on December 1, 2011. Bob Brinker's syndicated \\"Moneytalk\\" has been moved to KSFO, a politically conservative talk radio sister station which arguably better reflects Brinker's conservative politico-economic views (\\"Moneytalk\\" is a brand which is owned by ABC and its successor, not by Brinker; Brinker's own brand is \\"Marketimer\\", although Brinker has not and does not espouse market timing, as commonly understood, per se in any of his broadcasts or newsletters). Leo Laporte's weekend syndicated tech talk program was also a casualty of the format change and is no longer being broadcast on KGO. Gil Gross, Len Tillem and Leo Laporte are being broadcast by KKSF. The format change and termination of many popular talk show hosts sparked outrage among long-time listeners, many of whom called for sponsors to drop their advertising on the station. Ratings declined substantially following the change, with competitors KCBS and KQED-FM continuing to lead the market, and in December 2014, KGO reintroduced talk programming on weekdays. In December 2014, KGO added Chip Franklin to the noon to 3 pm lineup. In January 2015, KGO announced they had hired Chicago/San Antonio radio personality Kevin \\"DreX\\" Buchar, best known for his successful morning show on Chicago's WKSC-FM, which ran for more than a decade, from 7PM to 10PM. John Batchelor's syndicated show air overnights, returning KGO to the same level of news programming as before 2011. KGO's ident under an all-news format. Both KGO and Dallas-based sister station KLIF shared similar visual News/Information identities after KLIF's parent Cumulus acquired Citadel until 2014, when Talk programming was reintroduced. On March 31, 2016, at Noon, KGO dropped its previous programming and began stunting with recordings of speeches from influential figures and people talking about San Francisco, as well as songs about the city, while promoting \\"The Next Generation of KGO\\" to launch on April 5 (though with a break during the weekend for paid programming). At least 20 people, including the entire news staff, as well as some staffers from sister station KFOG, were laid off with the change. KGO San Francisco Stunting; Ronn Owens To KSFO - RadioInsight (published March 31, 2016)KGO 810 News, Talk & Traffic uploaded a photo (published March 31, 2016) Originally, long-time KGO host Ronn Owens announced that he would be moving to sister station KSFO in the afternoon slot beginning April 4. However, due to what was advertised as a 'listener reaction' against the move (in reality, Owens contested the move of his show off KGO as against the terms of his contract), Owens left with the station. KGO will also keep its News/Talk format, but will launch with a new live and local lineup, which includes Owens and Armstrong & Getty in mornings.KGO 810 announces next generation live and local line-up - KGO 810 official site (accessed April 4, 2016) =Sports= KGO was the radio broadcast home for the San Francisco 49ers football team from 1987 to 2005. It has broadcast the college football games of the University of California, Berkeley, Golden Bears since 1974. Since 2013, it also broadcasts men's basketball games that start after 7 pm or are on weekends. Games that start before 7 pm on weekdays air on KSFO.

Listeners were encouraged to call in and donate money to help in the fight against these kinds of cancer. An auction was also held to help raise money. Notable items up for auction have included a trip with Gene Burns on a private jet to various destinations, such as Las Vegas and Italy, for a gourmet dinner. Cumulus Media has announced that it will not be continuing the KGO Cure-a-Thon charity event despite the fact it has raised millions of dollars for charity in the past. Solar power In March 2008, solar panels were installed at KGO's transmitter site in Fremont, California, to offset some of its power consumption during daytime hours. The effort is a testbed for Pacific Gas and Electric Company and is located near the Dumbarton Bridge. The solar system uses both CPV (SolFocus) and PV (Premier Power) arrays and provides about 17 Kilowatts, or 33% (one third), of the radio frequency (RF) power output from the 50KW transmitter (or about 1/10th of the total power consumption of their transmitter site over a 24-hour period). United States Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi turned the system on during an on-air ceremony. Current programming KGO's weekday lineup is predominantly local in origin. Nikki Medoro hosts the morning drive time program, while Mark Thompson hosts late mornings. Pat Thurston, Chip Franklin and John Rothmann host early afternoons, afternoon drive and early evenings, respectively. John Batchelor (syndicated via Westwood One) airs in late night, while Coast to Coast AM (syndicated via Premiere Networks) runs in overnights. America in The Morning, from Westwood One, is heard just before dawn. Weekends feature shows on money, health, technology and home repairs, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated weekend shows include The Tech Guy with Leo Laporte and The Truth About Money with Ric Edelman. KGO is the flagship radio station for the San Francisco 49ers football team and also carries University of California Golden Bears Football. Most hours begin with world and national news from ABC Radio News. =Former personalities= * Gene Burns (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011); died May 25, 2013Gene Burns * Gil Gross (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011) * Ray Taliaferro (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011) * Len Tillem (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011; now podcasting) * Bernie Ward (program terminated due to federal investigation 12/31/2007) * Monty Stickles (sports announcer, writer, and sports-talk host from 1973 to 1985) * Jack Webb (announcer, producer, director, writer, and performer in the 1940s) =Former weekend personalities= * Gene Burns ‚Äî Dining Around, with Gene Burns (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011) * Michael Finney ‚Äî Consumer Talk ' (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 3/31/2016) * Joanie Greggains ‚Äî Health Talk (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 12/1/2011) * John Hamilton ‚Äî John Hamilton On-The-Go (Hamilton retired March 8, 2020 after 49 years with KGO Radio) * Maureen Langann ‚Äî Entertainment/News Talk, Hangin' with Langan (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 3/31/2016) * David Lazarus ‚Äî News Talk (left in 2007). * Pat Thurston ‚Äî News Talk (program hired by owner, Citadel 3/31/2006) * Brent Walters ‚Äî God Talk' (program terminated by owner, Cumulus Media 3/31/2016) * Bill Wattenburg ‚Äî Open Line to the West Coast (program terminated 12/1/2011) =Former notable and guest hosts= * Ken Bastida * Ira Blue * Barbara Boxer * Joy Browne * Chris Clarke * Peter B.

It airs an all-news radio format and is owned by Entercom. KNX is one of the oldest stations in the United States, having received its first broadcasting license, as KGC, in December 1921, in addition to tracing its history to the September 1920 operations of an earlier amateur station. The studios and offices, shared with sister stations KAMP-FM, KCBS-FM, KROQ-FM, KRTH and KTWV, are located on Los Angeles' Miracle Mile. KNX holds a Class A license as one of the original clear-channel stations allocated under the 1928 General Order 40 band plan. Its full-time 50,000 watt non-directional signal is heard around Southern California. With a good radio, it can be picked up at night throughout much of the Western United States and parts of Mexico and Canada. The station is even received by DXers in Hawaii and across the Pacific Ocean. The transmitter is in Columbia Park in Torrance at the northeast of Hawthorne Boulevard (California State Route 107) and 190th Street.Radio-Locator.com/KNX KNX is also authorized to broadcast a digital HD Radio signal, and is carried on the FM band by KRTH-FM-HD2's digital subchannel.\\"HD Radio Guide for Los Angeles\\" (hdradio.com) History =Origin= Although KNX received its first formal broadcasting station license on December 8, 1921, the station has traditionally dated its founding to September 10, 1920,\\"45th Year Marked By Station KNX\\" Billboard, September 25, 1965, page 56. starting with broadcasts conducted by Fred Christian over his amateur station, 6ADZ.The government's June 30, 1921 annual listing of amateur radio stations has 6ADZ licensed to the Electric Lighting Supply Company, 216 West Third Street, Los Angeles. (\\"Sixth District\\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (edition June 30, 1921), page 122.) The leading \\"6\\" in 6ADZ's call sign specified that the station was located in the sixth Radio Inspection district. The fact that the call sign's first letter, \\"A\\", was in the range A-W reflected its status as a standard amateur station. Christian was a former shipboard radio operator, who lived at 5118 Harold Way in Hollywood, California and was the manager of the Electric Lighting Supply Company at 216 West Third Street, Los Angeles. He later explained that he began the broadcasts in order to provide something to listen to by customers who had constructed receivers from parts purchased at the store.\\"KNX Spans 7 Decades of Los Angeles Radio History\\", Los Angeles Radio Guide, November/December 1995, pages 22-26. Christian began making broadcasts with a five-watt vacuum-tube transmitter, operating on the standard amateur wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz). =KGC= Initially there were no specific standards in the United States for radio stations making transmissions intended for the general public, and numerous stations under various classifications made entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, regulators of radio at this time, adopted a regulation that formally created a broadcasting station category, and stations were now required to hold a Limited Commercial license authorizing operation on wavelengths of 360 meters for \\"entertainment\\" broadcasts or 485 meters for \\"market and weather reports\\" (833 and 619 kHz).\\"Miscellaneous: Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. By the end of 1922 over 500 stations would be authorized nationwide. On December 8, 1921, the Electric Lighting Supply Company was issued a broadcasting station license with the randomly assigned call letters KGC, authorizing operation on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength. The station's location was listed as Fred Christian's Harold Way home.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. One year Limited Commercial license with the call letters KGC, serial #248, issued December 8, 1921 to the Electric Lighting Supply Company, 5118 Harold Way, Hollywood, California. This license was canceled on June 20, 1922. The shared 360 meter wavelength required timesharing agreements between an increasing number of stations needing exclusive time periods. On May 4 the Los Angeles Times reported that a total of seven local stations were slated to make broadcasts that day, comprising a schedule that ran from noon to 9:00 p.m., with KGC assigned 2:00-2:30 and 7:30-8:00 p.m.\\"What's Doing Today: Radio\\", Los Angeles Times, May 4, 1922, Part II, page 20. =KNX= April 1923 Electric Lighting Supply Company advertisement promoting its operation of KNX at the California Theater. On May 4, 1922, the Electric Lighting Supply Company was issued a broadcasting license for a station with the randomly assigned call letters of KNX, also on 360 meters, and located at the company's Los Angeles store on West Third Street.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1922, page 3. Three month Limited Commercial license with the call letters KNX, serial #358, issued May 4, 1922, to the Electric Lighting Supply Company, 216 West Third Street, Los Angeles. This was technically considered to be a second station in addition to KGC, however, after KGC was formally deleted on June 20, 1922, the Department of Commerce concluded that KGC and KNX were functionally the same station, and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records list December 8, 1921 as KNX's \\"date first licensed\\".Due to the overlap of the KGC and KNX licenses, the Department of Commerce's June 1, 1922 list of active authorizations included both KGC and KNX (June 1, 1922 list). However, the station list in the May 11, 1922 issue of the Los Angeles Times no longer included KGC, with KNX designated as one of the \\"stations not yet on the air\\". (\\"What's Doing Today: Radio\\", Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1922, Part II, pages 1, 10.) The new authorization coincided with preparations for a move to the California Theater, with Fred Christian continuing as station manager. On June 12, 1922 the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"After more than two months of preparation, the new broadcast station at the California Theater had its opening program Saturday evening at 9:15, sending out a wavelength of 510 meters [588 kHz].Although 360 meters was the normal transmitting wavelength during this period, on occasion the sixth district Radio Inspector, J. F. Dillon, would give permission for stations to make broadcasts on 510 meters. (\\"Radio Puts on Miners' Benefit\\", Oakland Tribune, September 15, 1922, page 32.) The station is said to be one of the best in the land, the call letters of which are KNX.\\"\\"Listening in: KHJ\\", Los Angeles Times, June 12, 1922, Part II, page 2. KNX's regular broadcast schedule on 360 meters was 9:00 to 10:00 a.m.\\"What's Doing Today: Radio\\", Los Angeles Times, June 8, 1922, Part II, page 24. A week after it commenced operations from the theater, the Times reported that \\"Numerous reports have come into The Times radio department commending the quality and audibility of material broadcast from KNX, the California Theater radiophone. This station differs from other stations in that it gives its listeners-in the music of the complete orchestra of the California Theater.\\"(untitled filler, third column), Los Angeles Times, June 19, 1922, Part II, page 2. KNX's power was raised to 100 watts in early August 1922.\\"KHJ's 'Radio Cave'\\", Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1922, Part II, page 6. In the fall of 1924, Guy Earl, Jr., owner of the Los Angeles Evening Express, arranged for the newspaper's purchase of KNX. The Express made significant upgrades, including increasing the power to 500 watts, and began broadcasting from the Paul G. Hoffman Studebaker building in Hollywood.\\"New Radio Station to Open Tonight\\", Santa Ana (California) Register, October 10, 1924, page 1. KNX was one of the last stations to have stayed on the original 360 meter wavelength, and the newspaper engineered a move to 890 kHz. It remained on this frequency until November 11, 1928,Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the U.S. (Edition June 30, 1928), page 173. when the station was reassigned to 1050 kHz, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40. In early 1928 KNX changed owners and was then operated by the Western Broadcast Company. In 1929 the station's transmitter power was upgraded from 500 to 5,000 watts, followed by an increase to 10,000 watts in 1932. In 1933, the station moved its studios to another part of Hollywood, after being granted permission by the FRC on June 7, 1932, to raise its output to 25,000 watts. The following year, KNX's transmitting power was raised to the nationwide maximum of 50,000 watts, which the station continues presently.\\"KNX 1070 kHz Los Angeles, CA\\" by Paul Sakrison (sakrison.com) CBS purchased KNX in 1936 and began operating it as its West Coast flagship, which ended CBS's eight-year affiliation with KHJ.\\"Biggest station deal in history effected.\\" Broadcasting, April 1, 1936, pp. 7, 62. In 1938, the CBS Columbia Square studiosToday in Radio History August 12 2005 were dedicated for KNX as well as West Coast operations for the entire CBS radio network. That October, the station carried Orson Welles' celebrated version of The War of the Worlds. In March 1941 the station was shifted to 1070 AM as part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement assignments, where it has been ever since. Theatre legend Jerome Lawrence got his start in radio writing at KNX in the late 1930s. Several legendary performers from the Golden Age of American network radio broadcast from there, including Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, George Burns, Edgar Bergen, Gene Autry and TV situation comedy star Bob Crane, who was KNX's morning host between 1957 and 1965 at the same time he was appearing as a featured supporting player on the ABC television network's The Donna Reed Show.\\"Bob Crane Biography\\" (who2.com) In 1951, KNX-AM gained a television cousin when CBS acquired KTSL-TV and rebranded it as KNXT-TV; it took on the current KCBS- TV callsign in 1984. KNX was a strong competitor in the Los Angeles market while Crane was a morning personality, but began declining in popularity after he left to star in the CBS television series Hogan's Heroes. Following the example of corporate sister station WCBS in New York City, which had enjoyed renewed success with an all-news format, KNX then became an all-news station in the spring of 1968.knx1070 Our Heritage By chance, its first major breaking news coverage was a major worldwide story that happened locally: the assassination of Democratic Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, on June 5 of that year. In August 2005, KNX moved out of Columbia Square after operating there for 67 years, and began broadcasting from new studios in the Miracle Mile district on Wilshire Boulevard.KNX History In 2009, KNX adopted the slogan \\"All news, all the time.\\" It was previously used for 40 years by KFWB, KNX's historic rival in the news radio wars before both became sister stations through the 1995 merger of Westinghouse Electric (KFWB's owner) and CBS. KFWB's format change to news- talk in September 2009 (and currently as a Regional Mexican station) now leaves KNX the only all-news outlet in the Los Angeles area, which is now emphasized in its alternate slogan, \\"Southern California's only 24-hour local news & traffic station\\". In 2017, KNX won its first ever national Edward R. Murrow award for \\"Breaking News\\". The station was also nominated for two 2017 NAB Marconi awards, Legendary Station of the Year and News/Talk Station of the Year. On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, then the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States; the sale to be conducted tax-free using a Reverse Morris Trust. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating KNX from KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017 and consummated 8 days later. Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger Emergency preparedness As KNX and competitor station KFI are local primary stations for the Los Angeles Emergency Alert System, they are responsible for activation of the EAS when hazardous weather alerts, disaster area declarations, and child abduction alerts are issued.\\"FCC Local Area Plan for the Emergency Alert System\\" Los Angeles County: Revision 2.0 7-24-2002 (caloes.ca.gov) Anchors and schedule As a former CBS-owned company, KNX airs CBS News updates every half an hour.

Antennas The station's antenna array features a 494-foot main antenna. The original main antenna (circa 1936) was destroyed by vandals on September 14, 1965. An unused 365-foot tower was brought in from KFAC (now KWKW) and was used while the new main antenna was constructed. This antenna was formerly in what is now a residential area to the south of the main antenna. The 365-foot tower now serves as KNX's emergency antenna. It was later relocated when much of the site was dedicated as a park in Torrance; it is now north of the main antenna, within the park. Only one antenna is active at a time. An experiment in the late 1960s using both antennas in a directional setup during the daytime was abandoned. = Electrical properties = The 494-foot main antenna is 0.5375 of a wavelength, or 193.5 degrees out of the 360 of a full cycle at 1070 kHz. It has an efficiency of 400.73 mV/m/kW at 1 km optimum.From FCC public information files. This is much better than average for a Class A station's main antenna. The FCC's minimum efficiency requirement is 362.10 mV/m/kW at 1 km.)From FCC rules, 47 CFR Part 73. The 365-foot emergency antenna is 145.5 electrical degrees with an efficiency of about 343 mV/m/kW at 1 km.Calculated from the electrical height, using FCC formulae.

KKOB is owned by Cumulus Media and is the oldest and among the most powerful AM radio stations in New Mexico. The station's format is news/talk, using the brand \\"96.3 Newsradio KKOB.\\" Its studios and offices are located in Downtown Albuquerque. The transmitter towers are located off Second Street NW in North Valley.Radio-Locator.com/KKOB KKOB is simulcast on the FM band, over co-owned 96.3 KKOB-FM. KKOB is a Class B radio station, operating with 50,000 watts around the clock, the maximum allowed by the Federal Communications Commission. It uses a non-directional signal during the daytime, reaching most of New Mexico's populated area, as well as parts of Colorado and Arizona. At night it uses a directional antenna to protect the Class A radio station on 770 kHz, co-owned WABC in New York City. But with a good radio on many nights, KKOB can be heard across much of the western half of North America. It is New Mexico's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. Programming KKOB's weekday schedule features mostly local talk shows in the daytime including Bob Clark in morning drive time, Darren White middays, TJ Trout afternoons and Brandon Vogt in the evening. The rest of the schedule is nationally syndicated talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Red Eye Radio and America in The Morning. Weekends includes shows on money, health, home repair, gardening and technology, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated shows on weekends include Jim Bohannon, Chris Plante, Ric Edelman and Bill Cunningham. KKOB also provides local news and weather updates around the clock, traffic \\"on the 7's\\" and national news updates from Westwood One News. =Sports= KKOB broadcasts University of New Mexico Lobos basketball and football games. Some other Lobo sports can also be heard on co- owned sports radio station KNML AM 610. History KKOB logo as an AM only station =Early Years= The station was founded by Ralph Willis Goddard at the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Las Cruces (now New Mexico State University). It began test broadcasts in 1919 under the call letters 5XD. On April 5, 1922, the station began regular operation as KOB, a call sign which had belonged to marine radio aboard the Princess Anne before its February 2, 1920 shipwreck on Rockaway Shoals, Long Island.\\"Broadcast Station Calls With a Past\\" by William Fenwick, Radio Broadcast, July 1928, page 150. New Mexico A&M; sold the station after Goddard was electrocuted while adjusting the transmitter on December 31, 1929.https://engr.nmsu.edu/news_26_10_goddard/ =Albuquerque Journal Ownership= In 1932,https://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/ccs/kob.htm the station moved to Albuquerque, and was later bought by the Albuquerque Journal. KOB was an NBC Red Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1948, Tom Pepperday, owner and publisher of the Journal, signed on Channel 4 KOB-TV, the first television station between the Mississippi River and the West Coast. The stations were acquired by Time Life in 1952. In 1957, they were sold to Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. On August 1, 1967, 93.3 KOB-FM first signed on.Broadcasting Yearbook 1968 page B-106 At first it simulcast AM 770 but it soon began its own format of beautiful music. In the 1980s, KOB-FM switched to adult contemporary music. =Separating KOB-TV from KOB Radio= Hubbard Broadcasting sold KOB-AM-FM in 1986. At that time, FCC regulations stated that stations could not share call signs if they were not co-owned. With Hubbard keeping the TV station as KOB-TV, new owner Southwest Radio had to find new call letters for the radio stations. In order to trade on the well-known KOB identity, Southwest simply added an extra \\"K\\" to the radio stations' call letters: KKOB and KKOB-FM. The change took place October 28. Despite their different ownership, KKOB AM 770 still has a news partnership with KOB-TV. In 1994, KKOB-AM-FM were sold to Citadel Broadcasting for $7.8 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-272 In 2011, Citadel was acquired by current owner Cumulus Media. Under Cumulus ownership, the station has dropped some shows syndicated by Premiere Networks, such as Coast-to-Coast AM and Sean Hannity. Premiere is owned by Cumulus rival iHeartMedia. The only Premiere Networks weekday show remaining on KKOB is Rush Limbaugh. KKOB now mostly airs programs syndicated by co-owned Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. =Legal Dispute with WABC New York= KOB was involved in a 38-year-long dispute over the use of the 770 kHz frequency with New York City station WABC (originally WJZ), a Class I-A clear-channel station. KOB was moved to AM 770 from AM 1030 to allow WBZ in Boston to have that frequency. The Federal Communications Commission requested that WJZ install a directional antenna to stop the two stations from interfering with each other over large areas of the middle of the country. But WJZ refused to comply, encroaching on the range KOB was intended to cover. Only after reaching the U.S. Supreme Court was the issue settled, when the FCC assigned KOB to a new license class. Decades later, KKOB and WABC became sister stations when Citadel Broadcasting purchased ABC Radio in 2007. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. =Hot Air Balloon Accident= On October 9, 2004, a Smokey Bear hot air balloon participating in the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta collided with one of KKOB's transmitter towers. Three people were on the balloon, Albuquerque pilot Bill Chapel and young passengers Aaron Whitacre of Tucson, Arizona and Troy Wells Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Luckily they were able to climb out of the basket and onto the tower. KKOB signed off the air and shut down its transmitter following the accident in order to enable the passengers to climb down to safety. The tower was energized and could have led to electrocution once the passengers set foot on ground. Because the accident was recorded by several local television stations, the footage has been licensed, and it has become a standard story on a number of televised reality programs which deal with \\"caught on camera\\" incidents. =Awards= 770 KKOB has been awarded four Marconi Awards from the National Association of Broadcasters. One in 1997, \\"Talk Station of the Year\\" in 2001, \\"Medium Market Station of the Year\\" in 2009 and \\"Legendary Station\\" in 2010. The station has received 13 nominations. KKOB was awarded \\"Station of the Year\\" honors from Radio & Records magazine in 2009.

The translator was owned by Martha Whitman, who owned smooth jazz outlet KOAZ 1510 and K279BP 103.7 (now licensed to Vanguard Media). Cumulus announced that it would purchase K233CG for $425,000. The FM signal had previously broadcast a 1980s hits format from KRKE (now KQNM) until late September 2015, when that station had been put up for sale. KQRI had rebroadcast on the translator from December 1, 2015 until mid August 2016. After launching the FM simulcast on the full-power 96.3 frequency, KKOB announced they would drop the simulcast on 94.5. The translator now simulcasts sister station KTBL.

Early life  William Chauvenet was born on a farm near Milford, Pennsylvania to William Marc Chauvenet and Mary B. Kerr and was raised in Philadelphia. Early in life he exhibited a knack for mathematics and all things mechanical. He entered Yale University at age 16, and graduated in 1840 with high honors. While at Yale, Chauvenet contributed to the school newspaper and was a pianist with the Beethoven Society. He was one of eight founding members of the Skull and Bones Society.  Academic career  He began his scholarly career by assisting a professor at Girard College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a series of magnetic observations. = United States Navy = In 1841, he was appointed a professor of mathematics in the United States Navy, and for a while served on the USS Mississippi teaching math. His professorship led Chauvenet to see the necessity of a United States naval academy. While others had proposed the idea, no one had actually seen it through. In 1842, he was appointed head of the naval asylum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the Naval Asylum, prospective officers took an eight-month course before sailing. Chauvenet felt the course was lacking and drew up his own plan for a two-year course. Presenting to several secretaries of the navy, the course was finally accepted in 1845. He was instrumental in the 1845 founding of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and taught there for years. He was president of the academic board and in 1851 was part of a board that recommended the course of study be extended to four years. Chauvenet taught in many subjects, including mathematics, surveying, astronomy, and navigation. He helped to establish an astronomical observatory at the naval academy. Chauvenet's contributions were so important that in 1890, Admiral S.R. Franklin proclaimed him \\"Father of the Naval Academy\\". A bronze plaque was installed with this inscription in 1916, at the behest of Congress. In 1855, he declined Yale's offer of a professorship of mathematics to continue working at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. = Washington University = In 1859, Yale again came calling, offering this time the professorship of astronomy and natural philosophy. Instead, Chauvenet took a job offered by Washington University in St. Louis: professor of mathematics and astronomy. He brought with him a deep love of music and a familiarity with the classics, in addition to being an outstanding figure in the world of science, noted by many historians as one of the foremost mathematical minds in the U.S. before the Civil War. It was Chauvenet who mathematically confirmed James B. Eads' plans for the first bridge to span the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The directors of the University chose him to be chancellor after his friend and Yale classmate Joseph Hoyt died in 1861. He came to his chancellorship in the midst of the Civil War in a state divided by the question of slavery. Washington University grew during his chancellorship, adding dozens of professors, hundreds of students, and several new programs, including the law school in 1867. He served as vice president of the United States National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Chauvenet authored many treatises and textbooks, including A Manual of Spherical and Practical Astronomy and Theory of the Ribbed Arch. The calculations of Chauvenet and Charles Pfeiffer were used by James Buchanan Eads in designing and building the Eads Bridge in St. Louis. Chauvenet served as chancellor until his death in 1870. William Greenleaf Eliot, founder of Washington University, succeeded him as chancellor. Chauvenet died in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Post-humous honors After his death, the Mathematical Association of America established a prestigious prize in his honor, the Chauvenet Prize; the Naval Academy named a mathematics building for him; and the U.S. Navy christened two ships after him, USS Chauvenet (AGS-11) and . The Chauvenet crater on the moon is named after him as well. Mount Chauvenet in the Rocky Mountains is named after him.

He is a 1985 graduate of Pepperdine University.  Early life  Bob Ctvrtlik was born in Long Beach, California to Margaret and Josef Ctvrtlik. He has two older brothers, Jeffrey and David. Their father, a native of Czechoslovakia's Moravian region, was a graduate of Charles University in Prague and knew eight languages. He was imprisoned for three months during the German occupation for refusing to serve as a translator. Josef left his country in 1948 by taking a train from Prague to Bratislava and then skiing to Austria with three friends. After 18 months in West Germany and five years in New Zealand working as a wool buyer, he moved to California in 1955 and worked as a professor at California State University, Long Beach before his death in 1983 from colon cancer. Bob Ctvrtlik graduated from Pepperdine University in 1985. Playing career Playing for Pepperdine, Ctvrtlik was the Most Valuable Player in NCAA volleyball in 1985. He also played for California State University, Long Beach in 1983-1984, where he earned all-league honors. In 1982-1983, he was a member of the Long Beach City College Vikings Men's Volleyball team, playing under Vikings head coach Gary Jacobson, where he and longtime friend and doubles partner, Allan Treffry, won the volleyball championship for the State of California. They would eventually be ranked number one in the United States. Ctvrtlik earned all league honors and was awarded the most valuable player in the state championship tournament. Ctvrtlik subsequently played a year for the Long Beach State, under 49ers coach Ray Ratelle. After one year, he transferred to Pepperdine University, to play his final collegiate year under the leadership and guidance of coaching legend Marv Dunphy, winning both the NCAA Title and personally, the NCAA's Most Valuable Player Award. After a successful college volleyball career, Bob followed his Pepperdine coach, Marv Dunphy, to the United States national team where Ctvrtlik quickly earned a starting position. In the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, Ctvrtlik, playing opposite of volleyball legend, Karch Kiraly, earned a gold medal by defeating the Soviet Union in the finals. For several years, Ctvrtlik played professionally in Italy, including winning the well-respected Euro- professional league championship. He returned to the United States Olympic team in preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics during which time he was awarded the most valuable player in the world on two separate occasions. Competing as team captain in Barcelona, he became one of the colorful \\"bald eagles\\" as all of the U.S. men's team players shaved their heads in protest of alleged officiating misconduct. The U.S. team defeated Cuba in the consolation match to take home the bronze medal. After the Barcelona games, Ctvrtlik returned to Europe to play in the Italian professional league. He would return to once again join the U.S. national team in preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Ctvrtlik is credited with improving the team's world ranking from 15th to 4th within a mere 10 months of his return. Ctvrtlik was again awarded the Best Player in the World honor in 1995 but the U.S. men's team would finish a disappointing 7th in the Atlanta Olympics. Throughout his Olympic years, Ctvrtlik also maintained a highly successful beach career, being one of the top stars on the professional four-man circuit. He also earned the coveted \\"AAA\\" beach rating on numerous occasions while playing on the two-man circuit. He retired from volleyball after the 1996 Olympic games. After volleyball In 1996, Ctvrtlik was elected to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athlete's Commission and then re-elected for an eight- year term at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was appointed to the IOC in 1999. He was a founding board member of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and served on the IOC Reform Committee.

In 1969 John Lennon and Yoko Ono recorded the song \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" in Room 1742 during their anti-war Bed-In. History Completed in 1958 as The Queen Elizabeth (), the hotel was built by the Canadian National Railway and managed for many years by Hilton Hotels. CN Hotels were later sold to Canadian Pacific Hotels, which is now known as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. With 1039 rooms and 21 floors it is the largest hotel in the province of Quebec, and the second largest Fairmont hotel in Canada after the Royal York in Toronto, which has 1365 rooms. Located at 900 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard West, in the heart of Downtown Montreal, it is connected to Central Station and to the underground city. Canadian National Railway selected leading architects and designers to give the interior decoration a \\"New France\\" theme, using Quebec handicrafts. The artists included Albert Edward Cloutier (carved wooden panels), Jean Dallaire (wall hanging), Marius Plamondon (stained glass mural), Claude Vermette (ceramic tiles) and Julien H√©bert (bronze elevator doors). Cloutier painted a mural for the main dining room of the Salle Bonaventure in the hotel.. There was controversy over naming the hotel: Quebec nationalists wanted it called Ch√¢teau Maisonneuve in honour of Montreal's founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. CN's president, Donald Gordon, insisted it be named for the queen, who had unexpectedly come to the throne in 1952 while the hotel was still on the drawing board. The French name, Le Reine √âlizabeth, may appear startling because of the use of the masculine article le. The article does not apply to the feminine noun Reine but to the understood masculine noun H√¥tel (as in Le Ritz). John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and guests recorded \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" in Room 1742 on June 1, 1969 Many famous guests have stayed there, including Queen Elizabeth II (four times) and the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, Fidel Castro, who was the first head of state to visit the hotel, Charles de Gaulle, and Princess Grace of Monaco, during Expo '67, Indira Gandhi, Jacques Chirac, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Sadiq Raji, Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, Perry Como, Joan Crawford, John Travolta, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and George W. Bush. The hotel reached worldwide fame when John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been refused entry into the United States, conducted their Bed-In in Room 1742 at the hotel between May 26 and June 2, 1969. \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" was recorded in this room on June 1 by Andr√© Perry. This song is the first solo single issued by Lennon, and became an anthem of the American anti-war movement during the 1970s. It peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on the British singles chart. The NHL Entry Draft was also held at the hotel ten times between 1963 and 1979. In 1970, the Quebec government moved its centre of operations into the Queen Elizabeth in the midst of the October Crisis. From June 17, 2016 to July 10, 2017, the hotel was closed for a $140M CAD renovation.https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/fairmont-the-queen-elizabeth- hotel-reopens-in-montreal/ References External links *Emporis Listing * Category:Canadian National Railway hotels Category:Hotels in Montreal Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1958 Category:Canadian Pacific Railway hotels Category:Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Category:International style architecture in Canada Category:Hotels established in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in Quebec Category:Downtown Montreal Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide ","title":"Queen Elizabeth Hotel"},{"id":"1248219","text":"A rocket docket refers to a court or other tribunal that is noted for its speedy disposition of cases and controversies that come before it, often by maintaining strict adherence to the law as pertains to filing deadlines, etc. The term was originally applied to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, after Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr., who ran the federal courthouse in Alexandria, decided that justice was being dispensed too slowly for his liking. The court earned the nickname among attorneys practicing there in the 1970s, who told stories of Bryan ruling on the spot when motions were argued, and trying entire cases in one afternoon. As of September 2011, the Eastern District of Virginia had the shortest average time from filing to disposition for civil cases that went to trial (at 12.1 months) and was second (behind the Eastern District of Pennsylvania) in median time for resolution of all civil cases. Later the term was applied to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Other jurisdictions that have been characterized as rocket dockets include the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; the United States District Court for the Southern District of California; the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia; and the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The U.S. Patent & Trademark Office has designated its expedited examination of design patent applications as a rocket docket. In Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky a team of prosecutors is assigned to the Progressive Criminal Justice Plan, referred to as the \\"rocket docket,\\" for speedy resolution of certain criminal matters. Another notable \\"rocket docket\\" court involved Lee County, Florida (Fort Myers), home of numerous foreclosure proceedings due to the collapse of the Florida housing market as a result of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, part of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. On some days, the court heard up to 1,000 cases per day; assuming an 8-hour day, this equates to less than 30 seconds per case. The entire case frequently consists of two questions: whether the homeowner is behind on payments, and whether they are still in the house. If yes, the judge allows the homeowner 60 days to come to an agreement with the bank for payments or lose the house.

The name itself is derived from corcair meaning \\"purple\\". History The name Corcoran is an anglicisation of the names of two Gaelic clans. The first was the √ì Corcr√°in in Ulster. The second was the MacCorcr√°in clan from Leinster, which was a sept of √ì Corcr√°in. Related variations of the name Corcoran historically include MacCorcoran, O'Corcoran, and Corcorran. The Corcorans were predominantly from Fermanagh and included a number of figures of historical importance such as the Bishop of Clogher in 1370 and Edmund O'Corcoran, \\"the hero of Limerick\\" (from the siege of 1691).Grenham, John: \\"Clans and Families of Ireland: The Heritage and Heraldry of Irish Clans and Families\\", Gill & Macmillan Ltd Many Corcorans become members of the clergy between the tenth and fifteenth centuries, they became based around the vicinity of Lough Erne, County Fermanagh in Ulster.

During the Plantation of Ulster and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 AD, the Corcorans were scattered. Many settled on lands in Connaught, Munster and Leinster.

The French journalist Pierre P√©an said that Aubame's training \\"as a practicing Catholic and a customs official helped to make him an integrated man, one of whom political power was not an end in itself.\\" Born into a Fang family, Aubame was orphaned at a young age. He was raised by the stepbrother of L√©on M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was spurred by the support of the missions and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists. Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several political unions which were sufficiently politically balanced to appeal to the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'√©tat against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville. Youth and early political career Christian mission, c. 1912 Born into a Fang family near Libreville, Aubame lost his father at eight years of age and his mother at eleven. Abb√© Jean Obame, stepbrother of L√©on M'ba, looked after the orphaned Aubame and arranged for schooling at several Roman Catholic missions. After he graduated, Aubame became a schoolteacher. M'ba helped get him a job in customs on 24 March 1931. First appointed to Libreville from 1931 to 1935, he was transferred to Bangui in 1935 and then to Brazzaville in 1936, where he co-founded a branch of the Mutuelle Gabonaise with a brother of politician Louis Bigmann. He was also a member of the Association des fonctionnaires, an organization which was dominated by two other soon-to-be politicians: Ren√©-Paul Sousatte and Jean R√©my Ayoun√©. Following the speech given by Charles de Gaulle on the Appeal of 18 June 1940, Aubame sided with the Free French, and in November was sent by Libreville authorities to rally Fangs for the cause. In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator F√©lix √âbou√© and quickly became his prot√©g√©. He served as an informant for √âbou√© on African affairs. Aubame's reward was to be one of several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 √âbou√© appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville. Aubame participated in the 1944 Brazzaville Conference and served in this post until 10 November 1946. After √âbou√©'s sudden death in March 1944, Aubame worked as an adviser to Governor-General Andr√© Bayardelle and his secretary Andr√© Soucadoux. They encouraged Aubame to run for office, and he returned to Gabon to campaign with the support of both the administration and the missionaries. Deputy =Deputy to the French National Assembly= Aubame lost in the 1945 elections, though on 10 November 1946 became Gabon's first representative to the French National Assembly by winning 7,069 votes out of 12,528 possible. From 1946 to 1951 he was Commissioner of shipping, the press, communication, labor and social security. He voted for Algerian independence on 27 August 1947 and for the establishment of a Council of Europe on 9 July 1949. On 17 June 1951, Aubame was reelected a deputy with 17,329 votes out of a total of 29,203 and on 2 January 1956 with 26,712 votes out of a total of 57,031, with this term lasting until the end of the Fourth French Republic. Around this time, M'ba was establishing his political career after being exiled to Oubangui-Chari. Affiliating with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Ind√©pendants d'Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were Senegalese L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured Gabon regularly. He continued to develop local Gabonese politics, in particular revitalizing the Fang clans. In fact, M'ba asserted that Aubame was too involved with the Fang to pay attention to the interests of the southern tribes, a charge Aubame ridiculed.. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. On 29 September 1951, he voted to increase the minimum wage in the overseas territories of France, and served as vice president of its Commission from 1953 to 1955. He organized the Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) in 1947, whose leadership came mostly from the interior, particularly Woleu-Ntem Province. The party in turn backed Aubame's reelection in 1951 and 1956. It had few philosophical differences with the M'ba-led Bloc D√©mocratique Gabonais (BDG), including advocating less economic dependence on France and faster \\"Africanization\\" of French political jobs. Fairly quickly, Gabonese politics became dominated by Aubame, supported by the missions and the administration, and M'ba, supported by the settlers. =Deputy to the Gabonese Territorial Assembly= In 1952 he was elected as Woleu-N'Tem's representative for Gabon's Territorial Assembly. He was re- elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG.. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount.. However, in the absence of an absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for inclusion in the government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21‚Äì19 vote.. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power..  Independence and opposition  = Opposition leader = Flag of Gabon After voting in favor of the Franco-African Community constitutional referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo- politically independent.. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77.. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.. With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions to appeal to the electorate.. On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote,. and later that day, M'ba, running unopposed, was elected president of Gabon. For his cooperation, M'ba appointed Aubame foreign minister, replacing Andr√© Gustave Anguil√©. In contrast to M'ba who wanted a strong executive regime, Aubame preferred a parliamentary republic.. Tensions rose when a new constitution was unanimously adopted, on 21 February 1961, providing for a \\"hyperpr√©sidentiel\\" regime.. Under this system, M'ba was able to appoint ministers whose functions and limitations were decided by him.. On 19 February, he broke his ties with Aubame; all UDSG representatives were dismissed, with the exception of M'ba supporter Francis Meye.. This was due to Aubame's refusal to merge the UDSG with M'ba's and create a one-party state. In an attempt to oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February.. Thereafter, M'ba claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with parliamentary functions.. Aubame resolved the accusation by resigning from his post as President of the Supreme Court, complicating matters for M'ba. Faced with reports of tension between the government and the National Assembly, even though 70% of its composition were BDG members, the Gabonese president dissolved the legislature on 21 January 1964. as an \\"economy measure\\".. The electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates.. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair. It is unlikely that Aubame participated in the planning of the 1964 Gabon coup d'√©tat. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters. =1964 Gabon coup d'√©tat= Gabonese and French military officers During the night of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese military, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Val√©re Essone, seized the presidential palace. They arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, several ministers, and President M'ba, who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint. On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d'√©tat had taken place, and that they required technical assistance and told the French not interfere in this matter. M'ba was instructed to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat. \\"The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits\\", he said. \\"It came to a boil.\\"\\"Le jour J est arriv√©, les injustices ont d√©pass√© la mesure, ce peuple est patient, mais sa patience a des limites... il est arriv√© √† bout.\\" During these events, no gunshots were fired. The people did not react strongly, which according to the military, was a sign of approval.. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame.. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks. Pesnot, Patrick (producer) & Billoud, Michel (director) (10 March 2007), 1964, le putsch rat√© contre L√©on M'Ba pr√©sident du Gabon [radio], France Inter. Retrieved on 22 August 2008. Aubame was unaware of the coup until the French ambassador to Gabon, Paul Cousseran, called him on the telephone roughly a half hour after sunrise. Cousseran, meanwhile, was awoken by the noisy streets and checked to see what was happening. Aubame replied that he was to find out why there was \\"no government\\", as Cousseran never directly mentioned a coup. However, about midway through the morning an automobile carrying the revolutionary committee arrived at Aubame's residence and drove him to the governmental offices, where he had been named president. Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to Ndjol√©, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambar√©n√©. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government quickly contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals would be protected and to ask him to prevent any French military intervention.. In Paris, French president Charles de Gaulle decided otherwise. M'ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa. While visiting France in 1961, M'ba said: \\"[a]ll Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon.\\"\\"Tout Gabonais a deux patries : la France et le Gabon.\\". Moreover, under his regime, Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment. Therefore, President de Gaulle, upon advice from his chief adviser on African policy, Jacques Foccart, decided that he would restore the legitimate government. This was in accordance with a 1960 treaty between Gabon and the French, which was ironically signed by Aubame in his stint as Foreign Minister. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was otherwise occupied, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M'ba to power... Over the course of the operation, one French soldier was killed, while 15 to 25 died on the Gabonese side. Trial at Lambar√©n√© Aubame and Gondjout fled Libreville as fugitives, though were eventually discovered. In August, the trial of the military rebels and provisional government was opened in Lambar√©n√©.. A \\"state of precations\\" was enacted, which decreed that the local government maintained surveillance over suspected troublemakers and, if necessary, order a curfew. Special permits were required to travel through the town. The trial was held in a school building overlooking the Ogooue River, near Albert Schweitzer's hospital. Space was limited, so there was no representative section of the public. One needed a permit to witness the trial, and family members were restricted to one each. Press coverage was limited, and journalists were only allowed if they were representing a high-profile news agency. In addition, there were restrictions on the defence of the accused. The prosecution called 64 witnesses to the trial. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame claimed that their involvement in the coup was due to a lack of development in the Gabonese army. Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if \\"that is the only reason for your coup d'√©tat, you deserve a severe penalty.\\" Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, at the request of some \\"putschists\\". He stated that the French intervention was an illegal act of interference, an assertion that Gondjout and Jean Mare Ekoh, a former education minister, shared. On 9 September, the judge came to a verdict without consulting M'ba.. Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile on a remote island off Settecama, down the coast of Gabon, as were most criminals of the case. He was not particularly popular during his political career, though according to Time, his arrest \\"ballooned him to heroic proportions in the eyes of the aroused public\\". While serving his 10 years of labor, he was beaten regularly by prison guards. Besides Aubame, M'ba imprisoned more than 150 of his opponents, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years of hard labor. The actor and the doctor were given 10 years of imprisonment each. While appealing for peace on 18 February, he pledged \\"no pardon or pity\\" to his enemies, but rather \\"total punishment\\". Later life M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. Afterward, Aubame lived in Paris and removed himself from the world of politics. He did visit Libreville in 1981, on which occasion Bongo appointed him \\"special adviser\\"‚Äîa mostly honorary post. Although not a supporter of the Movement for National Renewal (MORENA), his home was bombed on 12 December 1984 by anti-MORENA extremists. Aubame and his family barely escaped harm. Aubame, whom journalist Ronald Matthews described as having \\"a curiously harsh voice, a severe appearance, and... a stern character\\", died in 1989 in Libreville. The French journalist Pierre P√©an said that Aubame's training \\"as a practicing Catholic and a customs official helped to make him an integrated man, one of whom political power was not an end in itself.\\" Michael C. Reed speculates that, had Aubame become president instead of M'ba, he might have made the country more democratic. After his death, a Libreville high school was established in his name.

To the east of Kalepa Bridge, the highway continues to Kipahulu as Hawaii Route 31 (the Piilani Highway). Although Hana is only about from Kahului, an uninterrupted car-trip takes about 2.5 hours to drive, since the highway is very windy, narrow, and passes over 59 bridges, of which 46 are only one lane wide. There are approximately 620 curves along Route 360 from just east of Kahului to Hana, almost all of it through lush, tropical rainforest. Many of the concrete and steel bridges date back to 1910 and all but one are still in use. That one bridge, badly damaged by erosion, has been replaced by a portable steel ACROW bridge erected by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In August 2000, the highway was designated as the Hana Millennium Legacy Trail by President Bill Clinton, with the trail start designated in PƒÅia. The Hana Highway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 2001. Tourism The Hana Highway is a popular tourist attraction in Maui. Guidebooks often devote large sections to traveling the highway leading to the eastern side of Maui, documenting the many waterfalls and attractions that can be found along the way. Some of these attractions lie within or through private property and will often have \\"no trespassing\\" signs posted or even signs claiming that the attraction does not exist. All beaches in Hawaii are public. Some guidebooks document the \\"keep out\\" areas and ways past barbed wire fences and locked gates to reach attractions. Beyond the town of Hana, the Hana Highway becomes Hawaii State Road 330 and leads to the Oheo Gulch where the Seven Sacred Pools are located within the Kipahulu Area of the Haleakala National Park. Occasionally the dirt road past Route 31 is closed to traffic due to landslides. However, although it is somewhat rough in places, it is by no means a daunting or particularly dangerous road if taken slowly. Scenic turnouts abound, including one for Wailua Falls near the Seven Sacred Pools in Oheo. History In the sixteenth century, Maui's King Pi'ilani conquered East Maui and drew Hana into his political sphere. Pi'ilani built the Alaloa, the \\"long road,\\" from West Maui, a road on which travelers reportedly swung themselves over East Maui's rushing streams with ropes made of vines. Later, Piilani's son, Kihapiilani, extended the Alaloa into the Hana District. When completed, the road was wide, , and paved with hand-fitted basalt (lava) rocks. Modern road construction to Hana began in the 1870s, with an unpaved road built to facilitate the construction of the H√§m√§kua Ditch. Part of The East Maui Irrigation System, the H√§m√§kua Ditch brought water from the rainforests of HaleakalƒÅ to semi-arid central Maui to support the sugarcane industry. Road construction continued in the early 1900s and was extended piecemeal until the full road to Hana was officially opened on December 18, 1926. Construction of bridges continued through the 1930s and the road was not completely paved until the 1960s.

Hue level of color is proportional to (bigger) atoms charge. Electrons (smaller) on this time-scale are seen only stroboscopically and the hue level is their kinetic energy Coulombic explosions are a mechanism for transforming energy in intense electromagnetic fields into atomic motion and are thus useful for controlled destruction of relatively robust molecules. The explosions are a prominent technique in laser-based machining, and appear naturally in certain high-energy reactions. Mechanism The Coulombic repulsion of particles having the same electric charge can break the bonds that hold solids together. When done with a narrow laser beam, a small amount of solid explodes into a plasma of ionized atomic particles. It may be shown that the Coulomb explosion occurs in the same critical parameter regime as the superradiant phase transition i.e. when the destabilizing interactions become overwhelming and dominate over the native oscillatory phonon solid cluster binding motions which is also characteristic for the diamond synthesis. With their low mass, outer valence electrons responsible for chemical bonding are easily stripped from atoms, leaving them positively charged. Given a mutually repulsive state between atoms whose chemical bonds are broken, the material explodes into a small plasma cloud of energetic ions with higher velocities than seen in thermal emission. Technological Use A Coulomb explosion is a \\"cold\\" alternative to the dominant laser etching technique of thermal ablation, which depends on local heating, melting, and vaporization of molecules and atoms using less-intense beams. Pulse brevity down only to the nanosecond regime is sufficient to localize thermal ablation - before the heat is conducted far, the energy input (pulse) has ended. Nevertheless, thermally ablated materials may seal pores important in catalysis or battery operation, and recrystallize or even burn the substrate, thus changing the physical and chemical properties at the etch site. In contrast, even light foams remain unsealed after ablation by Coulomb explosion. Coulomb explosions for industrial machining are made with ultra-short (picosecond or femtoseconds) laser pulses. The enormous beam intensities required (10‚Äì400 terawatt per square centimeter thresholds, depending on material) are only practical to generate, shape, and deliver for very brief instants of time. Coulomb explosion etching can be used in any material to bore holes, remove surface layers, and texture and microstructure surfaces; e.g., to control ink loading in printing presses. Appearance in nature High speed camera imaging of alkali metals exploding in water has suggested the explosion is a coulomb explosion. During a nuclear explosion based on the fission of uranium, 167 MeV is emitted in the form of a coulombic explosion between each prior nucleus of uranium, the repulsive electrostatic energy between the two fission daughter nuclei, translates into the kinetic energy of the fission products that results in both the primary driver of the blackbody radiation that rapidly generates the hot dense plasma/nuclear fireball formation and thus also both later blast and thermal effects. At least one scientific paper suggests that coulomb explosion (specifically, the electrostatic repulsion of dissociated carboxyl groups of polyglutamic acid) may be part of the explosive action of nematocytes, the stinging cells in aquatic organisms of the phylum Cnidaria.

Voyage to Terra Australis 2(App. 3): 547 The entire genus is endemic to Australia but widely cultivated in many other regions and naturalised in scattered locations.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Their status as a separate taxon is in doubt, some authorities accepting that the difference between callistemons and melaleucas is not sufficient for them to be grouped in a separate genus. Description Callistemon species have commonly been referred to as bottlebrushes because of their cylindrical, brush like flowers resembling a traditional bottle brush. They are mostly found in the more temperate regions of Australia, especially along the east coast and typically favour moist conditions so when planted in gardens thrive on regular watering. However, two species are found in Tasmania and several others in the south-west of Western Australia. At least some species are drought-resistant and some are used in ornamental landscaping elsewhere in the world. Bottlebrush seed capsules right right right Callistemon viminalis in suburban Adelaide, South Australia. right Bottlebrush or Little John -- Dwarf Callistemon Taxonomy The Latin name Callistemon comes from the combination of 2 Greek words of 'callis' meaning beauty and 'stemon' meaning stamen, referring to the flowers of the plant. The genus Callistemon was first formally described in 1814 by Robert Brown. In his description he noted that the genus includes ‚Äúthose species of Metrosideros that have inflorescence similar to that of Melaleuca, and distinct elongated filaments.‚Äù Carl Linnaeus had described the genus Melaleuca in 1767 and in 1867, George Bentham brought all the Metrosideros species into Melaleuca. Bentham described melaleucas as having stamens united in bundles opposite the (five) petals. In his 1864 description of Callistemon salignus in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae, Ferdinand von Mueller noted that the difference between the genera was ‚Äúentirely artificial‚Äù (‚Äúomnino artificiale\\"). George Bentham also noted in Flora Australiensis that Callistemon ‚Äúpasses gradually into Melaleuca, with which F. Mueller proposes to unite it.‚Äù In 1876, Henri Ernest Baillon proposed in Histoire des Plantes that Callistemon, as well as Calothamnus and Lamarchea be merged into Melaleuca. Nevertheless, most authors had preserved the distinction between the two genera Callistemon and Melaleuca until 1998. In that year, in recognition of the fact that the callistemons and melaleucas on New Caledonia were clearly related, Lyndley Craven and J.W. Dawson transferred the callistemons on that island to Melaleuca, even though some (e.g. Melaleuca pancheri) do not have stamens fused in 5 groups. On the basis of DNA evidence, in 2006 and 2009 Craven moved all but four callistemons to melaleuca. Those four were Callistemon forresterae, Callistemon genofluvialis, Callistemon kenmorrisonii and Callistemon nyallingensis which were regarded as being hybrids. The new description of Melaleuca has been accepted by some herbaria but not all. For example, the Queensland Herbarium accepts Melaleuca flammea (synonym Callistemon acuminatus) but the New South Wales Herbarium accepts Callistemon acuminatus. In 2012, Frank Udovicic and Roger Spencer transferred the newly described species of melaleuca with separate stamens (e.g. Melaleuca megalongensis and Melaleuca wimmerensis) to Callistemon (hence Callistemon megalongensis and Callistemon wimmerensis). Their argument is that using the DNA evidence is premature. They further argue that if all the genera Beaufortia, Callistemon, Calothamnus, Conothamnus, Eremaea, Melaleuca, Phymatocarpus were combined (as Craven has suggested), then there would be no characteristics that would define the group. Use in horticulture Many commercial nurseries continue to use the name ‚Äò‚ÄôCallistemon‚Äô‚Äô. These species can be propagated either by cuttings (some species more easily than others), or from the seeds. Flowering is normally in spring and early summer (October‚ÄìDecember), but conditions may cause flowering at other times of the year. The obvious parts of the flower masses are stamens, with the pollen at the tip of the filament; the petals are inconspicuous (see picture). Flower heads vary in colour with species; most are red, but some are yellow, green, orange or white. Each flower head produces a profusion of triple-celled seed capsules around a stem (see picture) which remain on the plant with the seeds enclosed until stimulated to open when the plant dies or fire causes the release of the seeds. A few species release the seeds annually. Bottlebrush plants can be grown in pots. They have been grown in Europe since a specimen of Callistemon citrinus was introduced to Kew Gardens in London by Joseph Banks in 1789. Selected species There are about 50 species of callistemon.

Williams had initially retired in 2016, but he came out of retirement and rejoined the band in 2018 along with fellow band mates Brian Johnson and Phil Rudd. He started his professional music career in 1967 and had previously been in the English groups Home and Bandit. His first studio album with AC/DC was Powerage in 1978. Williams was inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of AC/DC in 2003. His side projects include benefit concerts. Early life Clifford Williams was born on 14 December 1949 in Romford, Essex. In 1961, he moved with his family to Hoylake, Merseyside, where he was influenced by the local Merseybeat movement and decided to become a musician. At the age of 13, he and some friends formed a band. He listed The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and blues musicians such as Bo Diddley as influences, and mostly learned to play bass by \\"listening to records and picking out notes\\", with his formal training limited to some lessons from a professional bassist in nearby Liverpool. He left school when he was 16 years old, working as an engineer by day and musician by night. Career =Early career= In 1966, Williams became a professional musician and moved to London, where he worked at a demolition site and in supermarkets while playing in various short-lived bands. He met guitarist Laurie Wisefield (later a member of Wishbone Ash) and the two became members of a band, Sugar, which soon broke up. In 1970, Williams and Wisefield joined with singer Mick Stubbs, keyboardist Clive John, and drummer Mick Cook to form the progressive rock group Home. The band signed a recording deal with Epic Records and issued their debut LP, Pause for a Hoarse Horse, in 1971. Home was a supporting act for Jeff Beck, Mott the Hoople, The Faces and Led Zeppelin. In 1972, Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released a self- titled album, featuring their only hit single, \\"Dreamer\\", which peaked at No. 41 in the UK album charts. Their next album, The Alchemist, followed in 1973, but did not gain chart success. When British folk singer-songwriter Al Stewart suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974, Mick Stubbs left the group. The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band, but split up after the tour. Williams briefly played with the American band Stars before forming Bandit in 1974. Bandit's line-up included vocalist Jim Diamond and drummer Graham Broad (later in Bucks Fizz and Roger Waters's band). The group signed with Arista Records and released a self-titled album in 1977. Bandit also performed as Alexis Korner's backing band on 1977's The Lost Album before disbanding later that year. =AC/DC= Williams performing with AC/DC in 2008 Williams performing with AC/DC in 1981 Williams considered retiring from music following Bandit's breakup, but one of the group's guitarists, Jimmy Litherland, convinced him to audition for the Australian group AC/DC, who were looking for a bassist after firing Mark Evans shortly after recording their 1977 studio album Let There Be Rock. AC/DC had formed in Australia in 1973 and by mid-1977 the line-up was Malcolm Young on rhythm guitar and backing vocals alongside his brother Angus Young on lead guitar, Phil Rudd on drums and Bon Scott on vocals. Shortly after deciding to audition for the band, Williams saw AC/DC on Top of the Pops and was impressed, describing them as \\"outrageous\\". For his audition, Williams played four jam sessions with the band, and on 27 May 1977 was officially asked to join AC/DC. Angus declared the decision was partially motivated by the bassist's good looks, which the band hoped would attract more women to their concerts. As Williams was replacing an Australian musician, there were issues resulting in problems obtaining a work permit to enter the country. His first performances with AC/DC were in Australia supporting the Let There Be Rock album, with two secret gigs at Sydney's Lifesaver. The album Powerage (1978), produced by Vanda & Young, marked Williams's studio debut. Williams remained in AC/DC from that time onwards until 2016, with only a temporary departure in 1991 as he suffered a kidney infection, during which Paul Greg had to play bass for some North American concerts in the Razors Edge World Tour. In addition to his role as bassist with AC/DC, Williams also contributed backing vocals. He has said that his favourite albums with the band are Powerage and Back in Black. =Side projects= In 1984, Williams played bass and backing vocals on Adam Bomb's song \\"I Want My Heavy Metal\\", for the album Fatal Attraction. During AC/DC's hiatus in the 2000s, Williams joined Bosnian musician Emir Bukovica's band Emir & Frozen Camels. The group recorded the album San in 2002 and played in some European clubs. In 2005, Williams and AC/DC singer Johnson played in a hurricane relief event in Florida, promoted by the John Entwistle Foundation. There Williams met drummer Steve Luongo, president of the foundation and former member of the John Entwistle band. Luongo later brought Williams, Johnson, and guitarist Mark Hitt for the Classic Rock Cares charity project. The quartet composed and recorded ten tracks in the studio in 2007, and followed that with a tour to raise funds for the foundation. In 2011, Williams played on a benefit concert organized by Mark Farner. Williams said he also occasionally plays with a rhythm and blues band from Fort Myers called The Juice. =Retirement= On 7 July 2016, Williams announced his plans to retire from the music industry following AC/DC's Rock or Bust World Tour. He cited his opinion that AC/DC was now \\"a changed animal\\" with the recent departures of several core band members; Malcolm Young could no longer contribute due to dementia, Phil Rudd could not tour due to being under house arrest, and Brian Johnson was forced into retirement due to hearing problems. In September 2016, during his last performance with AC/DC at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Williams was brought to the front of the stage by Angus Young to take a bow in the middle of \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\". On September 30, 2020, AC/DC officially confirmed that Williams, along with fellow band mates Brian Johnson and Phil Rudd, have rejoined the band. Accolades Since Williams' introduction to the band, AC/DC has been inducted to the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame (in 1988), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (in 2003). In 1982, Williams was chosen as \\"Bassist of the Year\\" in a vote conducted by Kerrang! magazine. Personal life Williams married Georganne, an American woman from Colorado, in 1980. They have two children: model and actress Erin Lucas (born 1985) and Luke (born 1986). The couple initially settled in Hawaii, but this left them feeling too isolated, and they found the school system to be lacking. In 1986, they moved to Fort Myers, Florida, at the suggestion of AC/DC bandmate and nearby Sarasota resident Brian Johnson. Williams also spends time in the French city of Aix-en-Provence, where he has distant relatives. Williams' hobbies include fishing and amateur flying. He is a self-described lover of wine.Katherine Cole, Q&A;: Cliff Williams, AC/DC, wine-searcher.com, 27 February 2013 Style Williams' role in AC/DC was to provide steady but basic basslines which followed the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, and at other times Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams has said of his playing, \\"It's not the [bass] line that counts. It is the feel. My favorite AC/DC tune to play is 'Down Payment Blues', because it's so simple. I play four notes throughout the song, but I get off on the whole thing‚Äînot me noodlin' away.\\" He also said that he plays \\"the same thing in every song, for the most part [...] in AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it\\". He added that \\"complex [bass] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar- oriented band like [AC/DC], so [he tries] to create a bottom layer that drives what [AC/DC's] guys are doing on top\\". Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring, \\"I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner.\\" Nevertheless, he very occasionally employs more melodic lines and passing notes on some songs, such as Satellite Blues. His playing technique is mostly centred around downpicking, with the occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says \\"adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain\\". Equipment In his first appearance in 1977, he used a Gibson Ripper only for the \\"Let There Be Rock\\" music video. Williams' trademark instrument is the StingRay and other basses by Music Man, strung with D'Addario (.045, .065, .085, .105) flatwounds in the studio and roundwound XLs in concert. Alt URL Williams states that despite trying other basses over the years, he always went back to Music Man's instruments, which he described as \\"a tremendous work horse of a bass\\". Other basses used include the Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Thunderbird non-reverse, Fender Jazz Bass, the Steinberger L-series, a Gibson EB-3 and at least two LAG Custom basses. Williams used 3 Ampeg SVT-810E cabinets with 2 SVT-4PRO Heads, but if there was any interference with the wireless systems, he used cables in his live performances.

The frequency coincidence (or resonance) can lead to greatly enhanced intensity of the Raman scattering, which facilitates the study of chemical compounds present at low concentrations. Raman scattering is usually extremely weak, of the order of 1 in 10 million photons that hit a sample are scattered with the loss (Stokes) or gain (anti-Stokes) of energy because of changes in vibrational energy of the molecules in the sample. Resonance enhancement of Raman scattering requires that the wavelength of the laser used is close to that of an electronic transition. In larger molecules the change in electron density can be largely confined to one part of the molecule, a chromophore, and in these cases the Raman bands that are enhanced are primarily from those parts of the molecule in which the electronic transition leads to a change in bond length or force constant in the excited state of the chromophore. For large molecules such as proteins, this selectivity helps to identify the observed bands as originating from vibrational modes of specific parts of the molecule or protein, such as the heme unit within myoglobin.  Overview  Raman spectroscopy and RR spectroscopy provide information about the vibrations of molecules, and can also be used for identifying unknown substances. RR spectroscopy has found wide application to the analysis of bioinorganic molecules. The technique measures the energy required to change the vibrational state of a molecule as does infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The mechanism and selection rules are different in each technique, however, band positions are identical and therefore the two methods provide complementary information. Infrared spectroscopy involves measuring the direct absorption of photons with the appropriate energy to excite molecular bond vibrational modes and phonons. The wavelengths of these photons lie in the infrared region of the spectrum, hence the name of the technique. Raman spectroscopy measures the excitation of bond vibrations by an inelastic scattering process, in which the incident photons are more energetic (usually in the visible, ultraviolet or even X-ray region) and lose (or gain in the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering) only part of their energy to the sample. The two methods are complementary because some vibrational transitions that are observed in IR spectroscopy are not observed in Raman spectroscopy, and vice versa. RR spectroscopy is an extension of conventional Raman spectroscopy that can provide increased sensitivity to specific (colored) compounds that are present at low (micro to millimolar) in an otherwise complex mixture of compounds. An advantage of resonance Raman spectroscopy over (normal) Raman spectroscopy is that the intensity of bands can be increased by several orders of magnitude. An application that illustrates this advantage is the study of the dioxygen unit in cytochrome c oxidase. Identification of the band associated with the O‚ÄìO stretching vibration was confirmed by using 18O‚Äì16O and 16O‚Äì16O isotopologues.  Basic theory  Rayleigh scattering, Stokes Raman scattering, and anti-Stokes Raman scattering The frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than 1012 to approximately 1014 Hz. These frequencies correspond to radiation in the infrared (IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. At any given instant, each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy. However, the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample. At room temperature, most molecules are in the lowest energy state‚Äîknown as the ground state. A few molecules are in higher energy states‚Äîknown as excited states. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution. Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state (except in the case of low-frequency modes). Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates: infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light. A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the absorption of energy by a vibrational transition. The energy, E, of a photon is :E=h u where h is Planck's constant and u is the frequency of the radiation. Thus, the energy required for such transition may be calculated if the frequency of the incident radiation is known. It is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an inelastic scattering process, Stokes Raman scattering being one such process. A photon is absorbed and then re-emitted (scattered) with lower energy. The difference in energy between the absorbed and re-emitted photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a higher vibrational mode. Anti-Stokes Raman scattering is another inelastic scattering process and only occurs from molecules starting in excited vibrational states; it results in light scattered with higher energy. Light scattered elastically (no change in energy between the incoming photons and the re-emitted/scattered photons) is known as Rayleigh scattering. Generally, the difference in energy is recorded as the difference in wavenumber (\\\\Delta \\\\bar u) between the laser light and the scattered light which is known as the Raman shift. A Raman spectrum is generated by plotting the intensity of the scattered light versus \\\\Delta \\\\bar u. Like infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify chemical compounds because the values of \\\\Delta \\\\bar u are indicative of different chemical species (their so-called chemical fingerprint). This is because the frequencies of vibrational transitions depend on the atomic masses and the bond strengths. Thus, armed with a database of spectra from known compounds, one can unambiguously identify many different known chemical compounds based on a Raman spectrum. The number of vibrational modes scales with the number of atoms in a molecule, which means that the Raman spectra from large molecules is complicated. For example, proteins typically contain thousands of atoms and therefore have thousands of vibrational modes. If these modes have similar energies (\\\\Delta \\\\bar u), then the spectrum may be incredibly cluttered and complicated. Not all vibrational transitions are Raman active, meaning that some vibrational transitions do not appear in the Raman spectrum. This is because of the spectroscopic selection rules for Raman spectra. In contrast to IR spectroscopy, where a transition can only be seen when that particular vibration causes a net change in dipole moment of the molecule, in Raman spectroscopy only transitions where the polarizability of the molecule changes along the vibrational coordinate can be observed. This is the fundamental difference in how IR and Raman spectroscopy access the vibrational transitions. In Raman spectroscopy, the incoming photon causes a momentary distortion of the electron distribution around a bond in a molecule, followed by re-emission of the radiation as the bond returns to its normal state. This causes temporary polarization of the bond and an induced dipole that disappears upon relaxation. In a molecule with a center of symmetry, a change in dipole is accomplished by loss of the center of symmetry, while a change in polarizability is compatible with preservation of the center of symmetry. Thus, in a centrosymmetric molecule, asymmetrical stretching and bending are IR active and Raman inactive, while symmetrical stretching and bending is Raman active and IR inactive. Hence, in a centrosymmetric molecule, IR and Raman spectroscopy are mutually exclusive. For molecules without a center of symmetry, each vibrational mode may be IR active, Raman active, both, or neither. Symmetrical stretches and bends, however, tend to be Raman active.  Theory of resonance Raman scattering  In resonance Raman spectroscopy, the wavelength of the incoming photons coincides with an electronic transition of the molecule or material. Electronic excitation of a molecule results in structural changes which are reflected in the enhancement of Raman scattering of certain vibrational modes. Vibrational modes that undergo a change in bond length and/or force constant during the electronic excitation can show a large increase in polarizability and hence Raman intensity. This is known as Tsuboi's rule, which gives a qualitative relationship between the nature of an electronic transition and the enhancement pattern in resonance Raman spectroscopy. The enhancement factor can be by a factor of 10 to > 100,000 and is most apparent in the case of œÄ-œÄ* transitions and least for metal centered (d‚Äìd) transitions. There two primary methods used to quantitatively understand resonance Raman enhancement. These are the transform theory, developed by Albrecht and the time-dependent theory developed by Heller.  Applications The selective enhancement of the Raman scattering from specific modes under resonance conditions means that resonance Raman spectroscopy is especially useful for large biomolecules with chromophores embedded in their structure. In such chromophores, the resonance scattering from charge-transfer (CT) electronic transitions of the metal complex generally result in enhancement of metal-ligand stretching modes, as well as some of the modes associated with the ligands alone. Hence, in a biomolecule such as hemoglobin, tuning the laser to near the charge-transfer electronic transition of the iron center results in a spectrum reflecting only the stretching and bending modes associated with the tetrapyrrole-iron group. Consequently, in a molecule with thousands of vibrational modes, RR spectroscopy allows us to look at relatively few vibrational modes at a time. The Raman spectrum of a protein containing perhaps hundreds of peptide bonds but only a single porphyrin molecule may show only the vibrations associated with the porphyrin. This reduces the complexity of the spectrum and allows for easier identification of an unknown protein. Also, if a protein has more than one chromophore, different chromophores can be studied individually if their CT bands differ in energy. In addition to identifying compounds, RR spectroscopy can also supply structural identification about chromophores in some cases. The main advantage of RR spectroscopy over non-resonant Raman spectroscopy is the large increase in intensity of the bands in question (by as much as a factor of 106). This allows RR spectra to be obtained with sample concentrations as low as 10‚àí8 M. It also makes it possible to record Raman spectra of short-lived excited state species when pulsed lasers are used. This is in stark contrast to non-resonant Raman spectra, which usually requires concentrations greater than 0.01 M. RR spectra usually exhibit fewer bands than the non resonant Raman spectrum of a compound, and the enhancement seen for each band can vary depending on the electronic transitions with which the laser is resonant. Since typically, RR spectroscopy are obtained with lasers at visible and near-UV wavelengths, spectra are more likely to be affected by fluorescence. Furthermore, photodegradation (photobleaching) and heating of the sample can occur as the sample also absorbs the excitation light, dissipating the energy as heat.  Instrumentation  Raman microscope The instrumentation used for resonance Raman spectroscopy is identical to that used for Raman spectroscopy; specifically, a highly monochromatic light source (a laser), with an emission wavelength in either the near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Since the energy of electronic transitions (i.e. the color) varies widely from compound to compound, wavelength-tunable lasers, which appeared in the early 1970s, are useful as they can be tuned to coincide with an electronic transition (resonance). However, the broadness of electronic transitions means that many laser wavelengths may be necessary and multi-line lasers (Argon and Krypton ion) are commonly used. The essential point is that the wavelength of the laser emission is coincident with an electronic absorption band of the compound of interest. The spectra obtained contain non- resonant Raman scattering of the matrix (e.g., solvent) also. Sample handling in Raman spectroscopy offers considerable advantages over FTIR spectroscopy in that glass can be used for windows, lenses, and other optical components. A further advantage is that whereas water absorbs strongly in the infrared region, which limits the pathlengths that can be used and masking large region of the spectrum, the intensity of Raman scattering from water is usually weak and direct absorption interferes only when near-infrared lasers (e.g., 1064 nm) are used. Therefore, water is an ideal solvent. However, since the laser is focused to a relatively small spot size, rapid heating of samples can occur. When resonance Raman spectra are recorded, however, sample heating and photo-bleaching can cause damage and a change to the Raman spectrum obtained. Furthermore, if the absorbance of the sample is high (> OD 2) over the wavelength range in which the Raman spectrum is recorded then inner-filter effects (reabsorption of the Raman scattering by the sample) can decrease signal intensity dramatically. Typically, the sample is placed into a tube, which can then be spun to decrease the sample's exposure to the laser light, and reduce the effects of photodegradation. Gaseous, liquid, and solid samples can all be analyzed using RR spectroscopy. Although scattered light leaves the sample in all directions the collection of the scattered light is achieved only over a relatively small solid angle by a lens and directed to the spectrograph and CCD detector. The laser beam can be at any angle with respect to the optical axis used to collect Raman scattering. In free space systems, the laser path is typically at an angle of 180¬∞ or 135¬∞ (a so-called back scattering arrangement). The 180¬∞ arrangement is typically used in microscopes and fiber optic based Raman probes. Other arrangements involve the laser passing at 90¬∞ with respect to the optical axis. Detection angles of 90¬∞ and 0¬∞ are less frequently used. The collected scattered radiation is focused into a spectrograph, in which the light is first collimated and then dispersed by a diffraction grating and refocused onto a CCD camera. The entire spectrum is recorded simultaneously and multiple scans can be acquired in a short period of time, which can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum through averaging. Use of this (or equivalent) equipment and following an appropriate protocol can yield better than 10% repeatability in absolute measurements for the rate of Raman scattering. This can be useful with resonance Raman for accurately determining optical transitions in structures with strong Van Hove singularities. Resonance hyper-Raman spectroscopy Resonance hyper-Raman spectroscopy is a variation on resonance Raman spectroscopy in which the aim is to achieve an excitation to a particular energy level in the target molecule of the sample by a phenomenon known as two-photon absorption. In two- photon absorption, two photons are simultaneously absorbed into a molecule. When that molecule relaxes from this excited state to its ground state, only one photon is emitted. This is a type of fluorescence. In resonance Raman spectroscopy, certain parts of molecules can be targeted by adjusting the wavelength of the incident laser beam to the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù (energy between two desired electron quantum levels) of the part of the molecule that is being studied. This is known as resonance fluorescence, hence the addition of the term ‚Äúresonance‚Äù to the name ‚ÄúRaman spectroscopy‚Äù. Some excited states can be achieved via single or double photon absorption. In these cases, however, the use of double photon excitation can be used to attain more information about these excited states than would a single photon absorption. There are some limitations and consequences to both resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy. Both resonance Raman and resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy employ a tunable laser. The wavelength of a tunable laser can be adjusted by the operator to wavelengths within a particular range. This frequency range, however, is dependent on the laser‚Äôs design. Regular resonance Raman spectroscopy, therefore, is only sensitive to the electron energy transitions that match that of the laser used in the experiment. The molecular parts that can be studied by normal resonance Raman spectroscopy is therefore limited to those bonds that happen to have a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù that fits somewhere into the spectrum of ‚Äúcolors‚Äù to which the laser used in that particular device can be tuned. Resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, can excite atoms to emit light at wavelengths outside the laser‚Äôs tunable range, thus expanding the range of possible components of a molecule that can be excited and therefore studied. Resonance hyper Raman spectroscopy is one of the types of ‚Äúnon-linear‚Äù Raman spectroscopy. In linear Raman spectroscopy, the amount of energy that goes into the excitation of an atom is the same amount that leaves the electron cloud of that atom when a photon is emitted and the electron cloud relaxes back down to its ground state. The term non-linear signifies reduced emission energy compared to input energy. In other words, the energy into the system no longer matches the energy out of the system. This is due to the fact that the energy input in hyper-Raman spectroscopy is much larger than that of typical Raman spectroscopy. Non-linear Raman spectroscopy tends to be more sensitive than conventional Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, it can significantly reduce, or even eliminate the effects of fluorescence. X-Ray Raman scattering In the X-ray region, enough energy is available for making electronic transitions possible. At core level resonances, X-ray Raman scattering can become the dominating part of the X-ray fluorescence spectrum. This is due to the resonant behavior of the Kramers-Heisenberg formula in which the denominator is minimized for incident energies that equal a core level. This type of scattering is also known as Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). In the soft X-ray range, RIXS has been shown to reflect crystal field excitations, which are often hard to observe with any other technique. Application of RIXS to strongly correlated materials is of particular value for gaining knowledge about their electronic structure. For certain wide band materials such as graphite, RIXS has been shown to (nearly) conserve crystal momentum and thus has found use as a complementary bandmapping technique.

He drummed for the band from 1989 to 1994, performing on their 1990 album The Razors Edge along with their first live album with singer Brian Johnson, AC/DC Live. He returned to the band in February 2015 to replace Phil Rudd for the \\"Rock or Bust World Tour\\". Slade has also played with Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Tom Jones, Toomorrow, The Firm, and Asia. Early life and career Slade was born Christopher Rees in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, South Wales. He has worked with Gary Numan, Tom Jones, Olivia Newton-John (as co-members of the band Toomorrow), and Uriah Heep. He was an original founding member of Manfred Mann's Earth Band, playing on their eight studio albums released from 1972 to 1978. In the mid-1980s Slade played with Paul Rodgers and Jimmy Page in the Firm. He has played with Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, and Gary Moore on his 1989 world tour. Slade received his highest exposure in November 1989 when he was asked to join AC/DC after drummer Simon Wright had departed. AC/DC were signed to the same management company as Gary Moore, with whom Slade had just finished touring. The Young brothers (Angus and Malcolm) initially hired Slade only temporarily through management, then asked him‚Äìduring the recording of the only album he made with them ‚Äì to join the band. Slade played on The Razors Edge album in 1990 and the accompanying world tour, and the \\"Big Gun\\" single released in 1993. According to Slade, after working on demos for the following album, Ballbreaker, Malcolm Young called Slade and told him they wanted to try a reunion with former drummer Phil Rudd. Slade replied, \\"That's me out then, I'm gone.\\" Young said that he wanted to keep Slade on hand if Rudd's return did not work out, but Slade refused. However he made statements that he still got on well with AC/DC and \\"it was an honour and a privilege to play with those guys\\". After his departure Slade spent a few years living in the UK countryside, before receiving a call from Geoff Downes of the British progressive rock group Asia. Slade played with Asia for six years, before departing in September 2005. Slade has fronted an AC/DC tribute band, Chris Slade Steel Circle, and is currently touring the World with THE CHRIS SLADE TIMELINE ‚Äì a band formed to celebrate 50 years as a rock drummer. The band takes music from all aspects of his lengthy career and has appeared at major festivals including Hellfest, 24 Hours of Le Mans, Harley Davidson Aquitaine, and Saint Tropez and is the only rock band to play the Moscow Olympic Stadium for the Kremlin Cup tennis tournament. Return to AC/DC Speculation regarding Slade's return to AC/DC started shortly after Phil Rudd's legal troubles became public. In a December 2014 podcast by Chris Jericho, Jericho mentioned that he had it on good authority that Slade would be returning to AC/DC. Slade was photographed signing albums with the band on 7 February 2015. After the photo appeared publicly, Slade finally admitted that he was going to be the band's drummer and admitted to secrecy surrounding his return, and stated that it was done for the right reasons. The band issued a statement, \\"Chris Slade will be on drums for the upcoming Rock or Bust world tour.\\". Since that time, in addition to playing live, Slade has appeared in all promotional photos taken with the band and appeared in the music video for the single \\"Rock the Blues Away\\". In late April 2015 AC/DC's official website listed him as the band's drummer. On 30 September 2020, his role within the band was made clear: Phil Rudd was returning to AC/DC on the drums, effectively making Slade leave the band for a second time. In the same announcement, Brian Johnson and Cliff Williams were also returning to the band. Equipment Slade endorses Drum Workshop drums, pedals and hardware, Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads, LP percussion and London drumsticks. Before switching to DW, he previously endorsed Pearl drums, pedals and hardware.

They were equipped with Scania DS11-74 engines (274 bhp) and Voith DIWA863 gearboxes.\\"Hong Kong Buses Part 3: Kowloon Motor Bus\\" Fleetline issue 249 July 1997 page 118 Another 20 were purchased in 1996, but equipped with Scania's DSC11-24 engine instead of DS11-74. All were withdrawn between 2010 and 2014. Singapore Singapore Bus Service took delivery of 200 Alexander PS bodied Scania N113CRB single deckers in 1989/90, 50 of which were air-conditioned and the remaining 150 non air- conditioned. Several of the non air-conditioned buses were retrofitted with air conditioning in 1998/99. These buses served mainly the eastern parts of Singapore and were predominantly under the control of the Bedok North depot, with a minority at Ang Mo Kio, Braddell and Hougang depots. They were transferred to SBS Transit on 1 November 2001 and retired from 19 August 2008 to 1 May 2009. These buses were repainted between January 2004 and December 2007. Some of them were already replaced by Volvo B10M who in turn replaced by Scania K230UB. The N113CRBs operated on a majority of trunk, feeder and Townlink services in the East. Australia Metro Tasmania purchased 147 Ansair bodied N113CRBs between 1989 and 1995.Metro Tasmania Australian Bus Fleet Lists Replacement In 1997, Scania introduced its 4-series range of buses, which utilised smaller and cleaner engines in order to comply with Euro2 emission limits. The N113 thus gave way to the low-floor, 9-litre- engined N94. However, N113 double-deckers continued to be sold in the UK until 2000, the last examples being a batch with East Lancs Cityzen bodies built for stock and sold to a variety of small operators. The N94 was eventually introduced to the UK in 2002, in both single-deck and double-deck forms. For the Hong Kong market, Scania developed the low-floor Scania K94UB 6x2/4 double-decker bus, but only one prototype was built.

Commissioned on 24 December 1997, it was the ninth of the ten Kilo-class submarines in the Indian Navy. On 4 June 2010, the Indian Defence Ministry and Zvezdochka shipyard signed a contract worth US$80 million to upgrade and overhaul the submarine. After the overhaul, it returned to India from Russia between May and June 2013. The submarine suffered a major fire and explosion on 14 August 2013 and sank at Mumbai's naval dockyard with the death of 18 crew members. Construction Sindhurakshak was constructed at the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Construction of the submarine began in 1995. It was launched in June 1997 and delivered to India in December 1997. Service history =Kargil war (1999)= Sindhurakshak was deployed very close to Karachi, Pakistan during the Kargil War in 1999. =President Kalam (2006)= President APJ Abdul Kalam on-board Sindhurakshak On 13 February 2006, during the submarine's deployment in Vishakhapatnam under the Eastern Naval Command, the then President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam became the first Indian head of state to sail in a submarine. He was given a demonstrative excursion, during which the submarine dived and sailed in the Bay of Bengal for a few hours. He was accompanied by the Chief of Naval Staff Arun Prakash. The submarine was commanded by Commander P S Bisht. =Accident (2010)= A fire broke out aboard Sindhurakshak while the vessel was in Visakhapatnam in February 2010. One sailor was killed and two others were injured. Navy officials reported that the fire had been caused by an explosion in the submarine's battery compartment, which occurred due to a faulty battery valve that leaked hydrogen gas. =Upgrades= After the fire damage in 2010, Sindhurakshak was transported to Russia on board a heavy lift ship from Visakhapatnam in June 2010 for refit, overhaul and upgrade which lasted two and a half years. In August 2010, Sindhurakshak arrived at the Zvezdochka shipyard in Russia. The submarine was modernised, repaired and retrofitted under Project 08773, and after the upgrade, the sea trials started in October 2012. The upgrades included improved electronic warfare systems, an integrated weapon control system and a new cooling system, and were expected to extend the service life of the submarine by ten years. The Club-S (3M54E1 anti-ship and 3M14E land attack) missiles, USHUS sonar, –°CS-MK-2 radio communication systems and Porpoise radio-locating radar, and other safety-enhancing features were incorporated. The submarine was handed back to the Indian Navy on 27 January 2013, after which it sailed back to India, under Commander Rajesh Ramkumar. This was the first time an Indian submarine had navigated under ice. Sindhurakshak at Portsmouth, UK, where it was berthed on its way to India after the mid-life overhaul =Incident in the Mediterranean= In March 2013, while returning from the refit, Sindhurakshak encountered severe storms in the Mediterranean Sea when it was travelling near Alexandria. This was part of the submarine's extensive three-month-long deployment, where it traveled 10,000 miles. The severity of the storms prevented the Alexandria port authorities from sending a tugboat, and the shallow waters prevented the submarine from diving. An emergency call was placed via the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to the Egyptian Navy, which sent its latest tugboats and towed the submarine to Port Said. =Explosion and sinking (2013)= On 14 August 2013, the Sindhurakshak sank after explosions caused by a fire on board when the submarine was berthed at Mumbai. The fire, followed by a series of ordnance blasts on the armed submarine, occurred shortly after midnight. The fire was put out within two hours though, due to damage from the explosions, the submarine sank and was partially submerged in 15 metres deep water at its berth, with only a portion of the sail visible above the water surface. Three sailors on board reportedly jumped off to safety. Navy divers were also brought in as there was a possibility that 18 personnel were trapped inside and Defence Minister A. K. Antony confirmed that there were fatalities. Other sources stated that a small explosion occurred around midnight which then triggered the two larger explosions. Due to the explosion, the front section of the submarine was twisted, bent and crumpled, and water had entered the forward compartment. Another submarine, was berthed very close to Sindhurakshak in the congested Mumbai naval dockyard; and sustained minor fire damage, though the navy did not release details of the extent of damage. Sindhurakshaks double hull was credited with preventing further damage to surrounding vessels. Official sources at the time said it was \\"highly unlikely\\" the submarine could be returned to service. The navy planned to begin salvage operations after the rescue operation was completed. By 19 August, seven bodies had been recovered, with 11 still missing. On 31 August, six of the eleven recovered bodies had been identified and sent home for last rites with military honours. The Navy's preliminary report indicated that \\"an accident or inadvertent mishandling of ammunition\\" was the cause of the explosions; the full incident report would only be completed after the submarine was raised. The salvage contract was awarded on 31 January 2014 to Resolve India, a subsidiary of the US-based Resolve Marine Group. The submarine was brought to the surface on 6 June 2014. In December 2014, a naval court of inquiry arrived at the preliminary conclusion that human error as a result of crew fatigue caused the disaster. A senior officer stated that \\"the crew was working beyond their prescribed hours. Fatigue and exhaustion may have triggered human error that led to the accident. Standard operating procedures were violated at several levels\\". A 2017 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India quoted the Navy's Board of Inquiry stating that \\"Submarine authorities concerned didn‚Äôt properly assess the crew fatigue, besides, the submarine was holding ammunition nearing life expiry\\". Initially, the navy was hopeful of using Sindhurakshak after it was salvaged, but on Navy Day 2015, Vice Admiral Cheema confirmed the Sindhurakshak would be disposed of. After a period of use for the training of marine commandos, the submarine was sunk in 3000 metres of water in the Arabian Sea during June 2017.

He invented both the alkaline battery and lithium battery while working for the Eveready Battery company. Life Urry was born January 29, 1927, in Pontypool, Ontario and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Toronto in 1950, having previously spent time serving in the Canadian army. He went to work for Eveready Battery a few months after graduating. He was married to Beverley Ann (died 1993) and they had 3 sons and 2 daughters. He died October 19, 2004, and is buried in Butternut Ridge Cemetery, in Eaton Township, Ohio.Christopher Reed The Guardian, 6 Dec 2004, \\"Lewis Urry\\" Work In 1955 Urry was dispatched to the company's laboratory in Parma, Ohio in order to discover a way of extending the life span of the zinc-carbon battery. The low longevity of these batteries had been seriously damaging sales. Urry realized that developing a new battery would be more cost-effective than developing the old ones further. Throughout the 1950s many engineers had experimented with alkaline batteries but nobody had been able to develop a longer running battery which was worth the higher cost of production. Urry, after testing a number of materials, discovered that manganese dioxide and solid zinc worked well coupled with an alkaline substance as an electrolyte. His main problem was that the battery could not provide enough power. Urry managed to overcome this problem by using powdered zinc. On October 9, 1957, Lewis Urry, Karl Kordesch, and P.A. Marsal filed US patent (2,960,558) for this revolutionary alkaline dry cell battery with a powdered zinc gel anode. It was granted in 1960 and assigned to Union Carbide Corporation.US Patent 2960558 In order to sell the idea to his managers, Urry put the battery in a toy car and raced it round the canteen against a similar car with one of the older batteries. His new invention had many times the durability, and Eveready began production of Urry's design in 1959.History of the Energizer Battery Company In 1980 the brand was renamed Energizer. Modern alkaline batteries, due to technological improvements, can last as much as 40 times longer than the original prototype. In 1999 Urry gave his first prototype battery, along with the first commercially produced cylindrical battery, to the Smithsonian Institution. Both cells are now displayed in the same room as Edison's lightbulb.

Sometimes abbreviated as RM, it refers to suitably qualified personnel‚Äînotably well versed in the law‚Äîbrought into an area from outside as the local magistrate, typically to be the guiding hand amongst other lay magistrates. In colonial history, resident magistrates have had gubernatorial functions in a few minor, isolated colonial settlements, such as: *Ascension, as dependency of Saint Helena; post filled by managers of Eastern Telegraph/Cable and Wireless since 1922 (previously under a commanding officer), replaced since June 1964 by an Administrator *Walvisbaai, only two incumbents shortly after the 12 March 1878 annexed by Britain as Walvis Bay protectorate, first under a Captain; annexation confirmed 14 December 1878: **1 June 1878 ‚Äì November 1880 D. Erskine **November 1880 ‚Äì 7 August 1884 Benjamin Musgrave, staying on as Magistrate Resident magistrates' courts remain in operation as one of the divisions of the judiciary of Jamaica, hearing civil and criminal cases in each parish of the island. In Ireland In pre-independence Ireland, a Resident Magistrate was a stipendary magistrate appointed to a county (outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Police District) to sit among the justices of the peace at Petty Sessions in that county. They were appointed by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in reality, therefore, by the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland). =Role= The role of resident magistrate was created on a somewhat trial basis in 1814, and extended to the entire country by the Constabulary (Ireland) Act 1836. The resident magistrate was supposed to sit amongst the justices at Petty Sessions‚Äîthe courts of summary jurisdiction in pre- independence Ireland‚Äîand guide the justices to apply the law impartially. In reality they came to preside at Petty Sessions, and even sit alone without justices. RMs did not need to be legally trained in pre-independence Ireland, and many were ex-British Army officers. The \\"Resident\\" referred to the requirement that the magistrate live in the county to which he was assigned. The role was often criticised as being under the influence of the Dublin Castle administration, and Irish politicians often cited the \\"RM\\" as really standing for \\"Removable Magistrate\\", since they held office at the Lord Lieutenant's pleasure and could be removed. In some parts of western counties in the later 1800s at the time of the Famine, and then the Land War, it became hard to find enough suitably-educated local magistrates, and so an RM could be sent to help them. He was salaried and they were volunteers. =After Irish independence= The office of RM was unique in the United Kingdom to Ireland, and in the 20th century, led to the modern position in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby courts of summary jurisdiction (the District Court in the Republic and Magistrates' Courts in Northern Ireland), are composed of legally qualified district judges sitting alone. This is in sharp contrast to England and Wales where magistrates courts mainly consist of benches of three lay justices and there are only a minority of paid district judges (magistrates' courts). In Scotland Justice of the Peace Courts are also primarily staffed by lay magistrates. Republic of Ireland In the part of Ireland that was to become the Irish Free State, Petty Sessions could not be held for many years due to the Irish War of Independence, restricting the role of the RMs. On 23 August 1922, the Provisional Government of Ireland placed all of the RMs on leave, and at the end of September 1922 it terminated all commissions of the peace, effectively dismissing all the RMs and justices of the peace. This was not quite the end of the office of Resident Magistrate, as it then proceeded to appoint 27 solicitors and barristers to the post. Although appointed to the position of Resident Magistrate, the Provisional Government only publicly described these individuals as District Justices, and brought in legislation in 1923 (the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923) to officially change the name of the position. The Courts of Justice Act 1924 finally abolished the office and transferred its jurisdiction to the District Court of Justice. The Justices of the District Court continued to be popularly called District Justices until the position was renamed Judge of the District Court (or District Judge) in 1991. Northern Ireland The position continued as before in Northern Ireland until 1935, when the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) was passed. From then on Resident Magistrates had to be legally qualified solicitors or barristers in Northern Ireland of at least six years' standing. Petty Sessions (which later became known as Magistrates' Courts) would henceforth consist solely of a resident magistrate sitting alone. Since the passing of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, two lay magistrates sit with the district judge in Youth Court (criminal proceedings involving children) and Family Proceedings Court (family law) matters, but the judge still sits alone in other matters. Where lay magistrates sit with the judge, the judge presides and guides the lay magistrates in the law. The position was renamed District Judge (Magistrates Court) in 2008. =In popular culture= The book Some Experiences of an Irish RM by Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin, published in 1899 focused on a fictional Irish RM, Major Yeates. Two sequels were written and a TV programme, The Irish R.M., produced by RT√â and UTV, which ran between 1983 and 1985.

Early life and family Born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, on 26 March 1933, Chippindale was the son of George Frederick Chippindale, an engineer in the Royal Air Force, and Irene Eulalia Chippindale (n√©e Neale). The family moved to New Zealand in 1938, and Ron Chippindale was educated at Rangiora High School. In 1954, Chippindale married June Rosemary Spackman, and the couple went on to have four children. RNZAF career Chippindale was a pilot for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) from 1951 to 1974, flying transport and training aircraft. He was a qualified flight instructor and spent over eight years in Defence Flight Safety before retiring (as a squadron leader) after 23 years of service. He was a graduate of the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. Inspector of Air Accidents On retirement from the RNZAF, Chippindale was appointed as an Inspector of Air Accidents in 1974 and in 1975 became Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in charge of the New Zealand Office of Air Accidents Investigations. During this time period, he was the investigator-in-charge of 48 aircraft and rail accidents and incidents, and had overall responsibility for the investigation of approximately 400 accidents and incidents. He was involved in several major aircraft accident investigation such as being the chief investigator of the November 1979 Mount Erebus Disaster, the DC-10 accident in Antarctica in which 257 lives were lost. He was responsible for the official accident report for this disaster and concluded the accident was a result of pilot error. This conclusion was controversial and a Royal Commission was established presided over by Justice Peter Mahon QC. Mahon's report cleared the crew and blamed the company for altering the programmed flight plan without informing the crew. As part of the report Chippindale was described as having a poor grasp of the flying involved in jet airline operation, as he (and the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority - CAA in general) was typically involved in investigating simple light aircraft crashes. Chippindale's investigation techniques were revealed as lacking in rigour, which allowed errors and avoidable gaps in knowledge to appear in reports. Consequently, Chippindale entirely missed the importance of the flight plan change and the rare meteorological conditions of Antarctica.https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/erebus-disaster/inquiry When the Office was abolished in 1990, he was appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC), which replaced the Office of Air Accidents Investigation. In 1992, when a Chief Executive was appointed, Chippindale became the Chief Inspector of Accidents with the TAIC, an appointment he retained until his retirement on 31 October 1998. He was a member of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) teams, which investigated the Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster in South Africa in which the President of Mozambique lost his life, and the shooting down of three civil aircraft: Korean Air Lines Flight 007 over Russia and two United Nations (UN) L-130 aircraft in Angola. Chippindale represented New Zealand at Accident Investigation Group meetings of ICAO and drafted the ICAO circular on the provision of \\"Family Assistance\\" after an aircraft accident. He was also the New Zealand Councillor to the International Society of Air Accident Investigators and a transport accident investigation consultant. Honours and awards In 1990, Chippindale received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 2004, he was awarded the Jerome F Lederer award for outstanding lifetime contributions in the field of aircraft accident investigation and prevention and achievement of the International Society of Air Safety Investigators' Objectives and technical excellence. In March 2007, Chippindale was one of 22 people who received a New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus) at a ceremony in Wellington. The medal was awarded for the work in what became known as \\"Operation Overdue\\". Death On 12 February 2008, while out on an early morning walk near his home in Porirua, 20 km north of Wellington, Chippindale was hit by an out-of-control car and was killed instantly. At the time of his death, Chippindale was an adjunct lecturer teaching \\"Aircraft Safety Investigations\\" in a three-paper series extramurally (by correspondence) at Massey University School of Aviation.

He was Italy's first Jewish Prime Minister. Early career Fortis was born in Forl√¨, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and became a lawyer. A republican follower of Giuseppe Mazzini he joined Giuseppe GaribaldiSarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 290 in 1866 and fought with him first in Trentino then at Mentana and in France.Fortis, Alessandro, Historical Dictionary of modern Italy After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1880, Fortis initially worked under Francesco Crispi as Under Secretary of the Interior (1887‚Äì1890). He served as Agriculture Minister from 1898 to 1899 in the first government of Luigi Pelloux (June 1898‚ÄìMay 1899). He resigned in 1899 and subsequently joined the liberal opposition of Giovanni Giolitti, whose liberal reformism was closest to Fortis‚Äôs own political views that had moderated over time. Fortis argued that a view of the state \\"which abstains from everything, which increasingly reduces its actions and its responsibilities; the state which is feared, rather than appealed to ... is, it seems to me, doomed to die out.\\"Ashley, Making Liberalism Work, p. 48 The moderate liberals opposed the repressive measures of Pelloux restricting political activity and free speech, and aimed to uphold constitutional liberties. Fortis supported the governments of Giuseppe Zanardelli (February 1901 ‚Äì November 1903) and Giolitti (November 1903 ‚Äì March 1905). Prime Minister In March 1905 on the recommendation of Giolitti, he formed his first government, mainly related to the nationalization of the railways, after confronting a railroad strike on April 17‚Äì22 that year,Italian Railroad Men To Begin Strike To-Day; Trains to be Run by Soldiers and Navy Engineers, The New York Times, April 17, 1905Italian Strike Ended; Arbitration Between Government and Railroad Men Planned, The New York Times, April 22, 1905 which could have paralyzed transportation in the country. Railroad workers became public employees, which deprived them of the right to strike.Ashley, Making Liberalism Work, p. 65 In September 1905, Fortis visited Calabria and Sicily to examine firsthand the extent of the damage of the 1905 Calabria earthquake. Subsequently he introduced a special law to aid these southern regions. This measure was the first real acknowledgment by the Italian state of the fundamental problems underlying southern underdevelopment. His government was defeated in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of Parliament) in December 1905, when a trade treaty with Spain that would have significantly reduced Italian tariffs on Spanish wine, met with severe parliamentary and public opposition and was rejected.Three Cabinets Resign; Italian, Greek, and Montenegrin - Italy's Modus with Spain Rejected, The New York Times, December 18, 1905 Fortis resigned, was reappointed and formed a new government, which did not gain the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, after which Fortis definitively resigned in February 1906.De Grand, The hunchback's tailor, p. 123 Death and family Fortis died on 4 December 1909 in Rome.

In the first one, Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, having first arrived to the peninsula in 1517, inquired the name of a certain settlement and the response in Yucatec Mayan was \\"I don't understand\\", which sounded like yucat√°n to the Spaniards. There are many possibilities of what the natives could have actually said, among which \\"mathan cauyi ath√°n\\", \\"tectec√°n\\", \\"ma'anaatik ka t'ann\\" and \\"ci u t'ann\\". This origin story was first told by Hern√°n Cort√©s in his letters to Charles V. Later 16th century historians Motolinia and Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara also repeat this version. In some versions the expedition is not the one captained by C√≥rdoba but instead the one a year later captained by Juan de Grijalva. The second major theory is that the name is in some way related to the yuca crop, as written by Bernal D√≠az del Castillo. Others theories claim that it is a derivative of Chontal Tabascan word yokat'an meaning speaker of the Yoko ochoco language, or an incorrect Nahuatl term yokatlan as supposedly \\"place of richness\\" (yohcƒÅuh can't be paired with tl√°n). History = Pre-human = The Yucat√°n Peninsula is the site of the Chicxulub crater impact, which was created 66 million years ago by an asteroid of about 10 to 15 kilometres (6 to 9 miles) in diameter at the end of the Cretaceous Period. =Maya= Mayan archeological sites. The Yucat√°n Peninsula constitutes a significant proportion of the ancient Maya lowlands (although the Maya culture extended south of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, through present Guatemala and into Honduras and highland Chiapas), and was the center of the Mayan civilization. There are many Maya archaeological sites throughout the peninsula; some of the better- known are Chichen Itza, Coba, Tulum and Uxmal. Indigenous Maya and Mestizos of partial Maya descent make up a sizable portion of the region's population, and Mayan languages are widely spoken there. =Spanish conquest= = Archaeological findings = In 2020, an underwater archaeological expedition led by Jer√≥nimo Avil√©s excavated Chan Hol cave, near the Tulum archaeological site in the state of Quintana Roo on the peninsula, and revealed an approximately 30-year-old skeleton of a woman who lived at least 9,900 years ago. According to craniometric measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the mesocephalic pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of syphilis. According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, \\"It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there‚Äù. The newly discovered skeleton was 140 meters away from the Chan Hol 2 site. Although archaeologists assumed the divers found the remains of the missing Chan Hol 2, the analysis proved that these assumptions were erroneous in a short time. Stinnesbeck compared the new bones to old photographs of Chan Hol 2 and showed that the two skeletons represent different individuals. Due to their distinctive features, study co- researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in Mexico during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene. Current administration The peninsula comprises the Mexican states of Yucat√°n, Campeche, and Quintana Roo, as well as Guatemala's Pet√©n Department and almost the whole of Belize. Population Total population of peninsula is 5.5 million. From this 4.5 million in Mexican part, 546,000 in Guatemalan part and 408,500 in Belize. Economy Cantarell In the late historic and early modern eras, the Yucat√°n Peninsula was largely a cattle ranching, logging, chicle and henequen production area. Since the 1970s (and the fall of the world henequen and chicle markets due to the advent of synthetic substitutes), the Yucat√°n Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards tourism, especially in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Once a small fishing village, Canc√∫n in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The Riviera Maya, which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between Canc√∫n and Tulum, houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of Playa del Carmen, the ecological parks Xcaret and Xel-H√° and the Maya ruins of Tulum and Coba. Geology Sediment off the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The peninsula is the exposed portion of the larger Yucat√°n Platform, all of which is composed of carbonate and soluble rocks, being mostly limestone although dolomite and evaporites are also present at various depths. The whole of the Yucat√°n Peninsula is an unconfined flat lying karst landscape. Sinkholes, known locally as cenotes, are widespread in the northern lowlands. According to the Alvarez hypothesis, the mass extinction of the dinosaurs at the transition from the Cretaceous to the Paleogene Period, the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìPg boundary), 65 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact somewhere in the greater Caribbean Basin. The deeply buried Chicxulub crater is centered off the north coast of the peninsula near the town of Chicxulub. The now-famous \\"Ring of Cenotes\\" (visible in NASA imagery) outlines one of the shock-waves from this impact event in the rock of ~66 million years of age, which lies more than 1 km below the modern ground surface near the centre, with the rock above the impact strata all being younger in age. The presence of the crater has been determined first on the surface from the Ring of Cenotes, but also by geophysical methods, and direct drilling with recovery of the drill cores. The Arrowsmith Bank is a submerged bank located off the northeastern end of the peninsula.Arrowsmith Bank, Undersea Features - Geographical Names Water resources Due to the extreme karst nature of the whole peninsula, the northern half is devoid of rivers. Where lakes and swamps are present, the water is marshy and generally unpotable. Due to its coastal location, the whole of the peninsula is underlain by an extensive contiguous density stratified coastal aquifer, where a fresh water lens formed from meteoric water floats on top of intruding saline water from the coastal margins. The thousands of sinkholes known as cenotes throughout the region provide access to the groundwater system. The cenotes have long been relied on by ancient and contemporary Maya people.BBC: Planet Earth, part 4: Caves. Flora Short and tall tropical jungles are the predominant natural vegetation types of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The boundaries between northern Guatemala (El Pet√©n), Mexico (Campeche and Quintana Roo), and western Belize are still occupied by the largest continuous tracts of tropical rainforest in Central America. However, these forests are suffering extensive deforestation.  Climate  Like much of the Caribbean, the peninsula lies within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, and with its almost uniformly flat terrain it is vulnerable to these large storms coming from the east. The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was a particularly bad season for Mexico's tourism industry, with two forceful category 5 storms hitting, Hurricane Emily and Hurricane Wilma. The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was a typical year which left the Yucat√°n untouched, but in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season Yucat√°n was hit by Hurricane Dean (also a category 5 storm), nevertheless Dean left little damage on the peninsula despite heavy localized flooding. Strong storms called nortes can quickly descend on the Yucat√°n Peninsula any time of year. Although these storms pummel the area with heavy rains and high winds, they tend to be short- lived, clearing after about an hour. The average percentage of days with rain per month ranges from a monthly low of 7% in April to a high of 25% in October. Breezes can have a cooling effect, humidity is generally high, particularly in the remaining rainforest areas.

Through their production, the full- size vans were sold under several different nameplates. Most examples were sold by the Dodge division, although rebadged versions were sold by the now- defunct Fargo and Plymouth divisions. Despite many customer requests, the B-series was not available in the desired 360 V8 model until 1972.1974 Plymouth Voyager promotional postcard (McLellan's Automotive)Readers' Rides; 1974 Plymouth Voyager (Grassroots Motorsports) Although Chrysler would make two redesigns of the B-platform van, much of the exterior sheetmetal would remain nearly unchanged over 32 years of production, making it one of the longest-used automotive platforms in American automotive history. For 2003, DaimlerChrysler introduced the Dodge Sprinter (produced by Mercedes-Benz), making the B-platform van the last full-size van designed by Chrysler; Ram Trucks currently markets the Ram ProMaster (a rebadged Fiat Ducato). For its entire production run, Chrysler produced the B-platform vans at the now- demolished Pillette Road Truck Assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. History Built on the B platform (later AB), the full-size vans entered production for the 1971 model year. Due to a one-welded-piece \\"Uniframe\\" design, the Dodge platform was lighter and stronger and featured a lower cargo floor than the competition, at the expense of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). The resulting lower center of gravity improved handling versus the competing products. The B-series van was popular for cab-over motorhome conversion until Chrysler Corporation's egress from that market during their financial difficulties in the late 1970s. All generations of the B-series van feature similar construction, with only small variation from era to era. The most pronounced changes were to the front fenders, hood, grille, and bumpers, which tended to follow their full-size truck counterparts in each era. Much of this was a result of the need to meet Federal \\"crashworthiness\\" standards. Additionally, the first generation's side door was mounted back several inches, using a fixed panel between the passenger's side front door and the side door, allowing for more access to the side door without interfering with the front passenger's seat. This panel was eliminated in 1978 which was a transitional year for the B-series van. Similar construction for the entire 32 years of production made the Dodge Van very popular with upbuilders, service companies, and other fleets due to the compatibility of installable options from year to year without necessitating a redesign. Dodge first x mark pioneered the extended-rear 15-passenger van favored by school and church groups and dominated this market until overtaken by Ford in the 1990s. It offered a sliding side door as well as a unique side-swinging tail door with a full-width window. It was also popular in class-C RV and ambulance conversions. The minivan eventually took over the passenger wagon market. With the Sprinter, Chrysler shifted from American-style full-sized vans in favor of more fuel-efficient European-style models. Third-generation Dodge Ram van engine bay The B-series van was available with nearly every engine used in a rear-wheel-drive Chrysler product during its production. Six-cylinder engines included the slant six I6 (1971‚Äì1987), the 3.9-liter LA V6 (1988‚Äì1991), and the 3.9 L Magnum V6 (1992‚Äì2007). Small-block V8 engines included the LA-series 318 in3 (1971‚Äì1991), 360 in3 (1972‚Äì1992), the Magnum 5.2 L (1992‚Äì2007), and the Magnum 5.9 L (1993‚Äì2007). Big-block V8 engines were the and (1976‚Äì1978). Certain model years came with an optional 5.2-liter engine utilizing compressed natural gas (CNG), with a range of up to on a full tank, and CNG- powered Ram vans were classified as super ultra-low emission vehicles in 1999. Dodge was the last of the four major full-size van makers to market a short- wheelbase van and passenger wagon. The rest of the Big Three took their shortest full-size vans off the market early in the 1990s. All American vans are now produced with wheelbases proportional to the body length (i.e. made longer to match van size), rather than a fixed length that does not change with body or roof size extensions (as with the E-series and Ram vans). DaimlerChrysler discontinued production of the Ram van and Ram wagon after the 2003 model year, replacing them with the M-B-based Dodge Sprinter. Original B series 1977 Sportsman For the first eight model years, the different configurations of B vans were given names. Sportsman passenger vans had side windows and passenger seating not present in the otherwise identical Tradesman models. The same range of gasoline-powered slant-6 and V8 engines was offered in these vans as was offered in the Dodge D Series pickup truck. Dodge pioneered the American 15-passenger van genre with the introduction of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971. Ford did not produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and rear end cap. On the standard length vans, the rear end cap just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971‚Äì1977 models, the rear side doors were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a filler panel between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes. In 1978, the filler panel was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the front passenger door, similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans. In the late 1970s, Chrysler marketed the B van in their lineup of \\"Adult Toys\\", along with the D-Series-based Dodge Warlock, Dodge Lil' Red Express Truck, and Dodge Macho Power Wagon, plus the Dodge Macho Ramcharger. =Street van= 1978 Dodge Street Van Dodge vans, particularly Tradesman vans from the 1971‚Äì1977 model years, were very popular as the basis for many custom vans during the custom van craze that occurred during the mid- to late 1970s and early 1980s. Dodge capitalized on this craze, creating a factory customization package called the \\"Street Van\\" package. This was advertised alongside the Lil' Red Express and Warlock trucks as \\"Adult Toys\\". The Street Van package consisted of a \\"Street Van\\" logo on the passenger and driver's side door in lieu of the Tradesman logos, chrome trim on the grille and windshield, simulated wood grain inlays in the steering wheel horn cover and passenger side glare shield, five-slot chrome wheels or white spoked \\"off- road\\" type wheels, chrome front and rear bumpers, chrome trim on the gauges, smaller chrome side-view mirrors, patterns and plans to create custom interiors, and membership in the \\"Dodge Van Clan\\". This package was available from the 1976 model year until it was discontinued in the early 1980s. This was not an overly popular option from the factory, and Street Vans are somewhat rare. The chrome metal Street Van emblems found on later Street Vans (emblems through mid-1978 were stickers) in good shape are quite valuable to collectors or restorers. =Kary van= The name \\"Kary van\\" comes from the cube shape of the cargo section of the van. Dodge used the van body for the front end of its 1973‚Äì1978 cube-vans usually with dual rear axles and heavy- duty 1-Ton suspensions. Many examples of these cube-vans can still be found on the streets today as they were typically owned by companies that kept them in service for some time. Thanks to regular maintenance, some still see service. =Rebadged variants= Last-generation Fargo van During the last two years of its existence, Fargo offered a rebadged variant of the Tradesman and Sportsman in Canada for 1971 and 1987 only. Plymouth also received a rebadged variant of the Sportsman, called the Voyager for the 1974 model year. While never as popular as the Dodge version, Plymouth marketed the Voyager in this format through 1983, after which the nameplate was transferred to the new minivan that was introduced for 1984 as a rebadged Dodge Caravan. Second generation In 1979 the van received a redesigned front end, including a new grille with wraparound turn signals. Lower-end models had single round headlights, while Royal Sportsman and other high-end vans received four rectangular headlights. The van would keep this body style and the 1978 dash intact with only grille changes all the way through the 1993 model year. The Sportsman, Tradesman, and Adventurer names were phased out after 1980, replaced with the Ram van moniker, which included the Ram wagon for passenger models. As with the D-series trucks, B100 and B150 models were 1/2-ton rated, B250 models were 3/4-ton, and B350s were one-ton. The body shell and most fixtures would be one of the longest running of any US vehicle, remaining nearly identical from the vans' introduction in 1971 through their discontinuance in 2003, while Ford and GM would go through two or three generations of platform redesigns. Kentron Inc. build exclusively on Dodge chassis doing Van conversion. They had range of conversions including Medallion 7 & Medallion 7 SR, Daytona & Daytona SR, Traveler SR, Special Edition, Conquest & Conquest SR, various Polara Models. Each will be marked with the conversion model plaque and a badge. In 1986 the Ram van was given a new grille to resemble those of the 1986 Ram trucks. In 1994 the entire front end was redesigned with flush headlamps to resemble the all-new Dodge Ram pickups, and new taillights wrapped around the sides of the van. The 1978-style dash was kept. Third generation In 1994, the entire front end was redesigned with flush headlamps to resemble the all new Dodge Ram pickups, and new taillights wrapped around the sides of the van. The 1978-style dash was kept. In 1998, the van went through the most thorough update since its introduction in 1971. The engine was moved forward in the chassis to improve crash protection, and the front end sheet-metal was redone with a longer nose to accommodate this change. Moving the powertrain forward also resulted in a smaller dog house (engine access cover) which increased front interior room and allowed better access when moving between the front seats. The 1978-style dashboard and door panels were finally replaced in the 1998 model year with a modern design using components from contemporary Chrysler products. The side- view mirrors were now break-away units mounted to the sail portion of the front window openings. This change resulted in the elimination of the front door vent windows. The van remained mostly unchanged until it was discontinued after the 2003 model year, ending production that June. =Revival= In 2012, a Dodge Caravan-based cargo van, previously sold as the Dodge Caravan C/V, was renamed the Ram C/V Tradesman. In 2013, a new Mexican-built full-sized van based on the Fiat Ducato was introduced and sold under the name Ram ProMaster, which fills the marketing slot once held by the original Dodge B-Series full- size van. The Ram ProMaster City, a Fiat Doblo-based replacement for the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V Tradesman, was introduced in 2014. The Turkish-sourced Promaster City is said to be a modern descendant of the Dodge A100 compact van in the showroom lineup. Both of these vehicles are FWD.

The university offers a large number of programs at Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. levels. History Shahid Beheshti University was founded as the National University of Iran in 1959 by Ali Sheikholislam, the second-best public university in Iran. The university was planned to be devoted to graduate studies. At its opening, it consisted of two schools: Architecture and Urban Planning, and Banking and Economics, with 174 students. Soon the School of Literature and Foreign Languages began in downtown Tehran. The first graduate academic degree program was the Master's course in the School of Architecture, launched in 1961. In 1962, a new main campus was built in Evin, a suburb in the north of Tehran. Academic offerings expanded as facilities were added. By 1978 several other faculties became active i.e.the faculties of Literature and Human Sciences, Basic Sciences, Law, Earth Sciences, Statistics and Informatics and Education and Psychology. Due to an academic reform in 1986, the medical schools were separated from the main universities and became Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences working under the purview of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The first PhD course was offered in the School of Economics in 1991. The university's name was changed during the Cultural Revolution in Iranian universities, 1980-82. Under royal auspices, the university library began to acquire important collections in the field of Oriental studies and literary classics in French and German. During that period, the university library ranked in importance second in the country only to Aryamehr (later Sharif) University of Technology. In 2012, the university's new main office building was completed. In spring 2013, Power and Water University of Technology (PWUT) was merged into Shahid Beheshti University.

Nuyorican Poets Cafe Nuyorican Poets Cafe In 1989 Torres began working as a graphic designer and a year later he discovered the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which inspired his creative instincts. Torres created a movement which he called \\"Interactive Eclectrcism\\", which combines movement, audience participation, music and songs. The Nuyorican Poets Cafe not only opened its door for his creation but it also opened the doors to a new world of reading poetry. Torres also created the \\"Poets Neurotica\\", where dancers and musicians performed alongside two to four poets. He was a member of \\"Real Live Poetry\\" from 1993‚Äì99, performing and conducting workshops across the US and overseas.

Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in 1968, collaborating on several experimental releases. Following their marriage in 1969, they decided their future endeavours would be credited to a conceptual and collaborative vehicle, Plastic Ono Band. The band featured a rotating lineup of musicians including Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Keith Moon, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, and Lennon's former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr. After the Lennons' move to New York, they collaborated with Elephant's Memory under the moniker of the \\"Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band\\". Lennon's collaborations continued under similar names, until the winding down of the concept in 1974. From 2009‚Äì2015 (29 years following the death of Lennon in 1980), Ono and her son Sean Lennon led a new incarnation of the group, the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band. History =Origins and formation (1968‚Äì1969)= John Lennon and Yoko Ono first met in 1966. Lennon was a world-famous member of the Beatles, and Ono was an avant- garde artist and performer. By 1968, the two established a romantic relationship and they began collaborating on a number of musical projects. They first recorded together in May 1968; these recordings would be released in November as the experimental album Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins. The pair also worked throughout the summer on \\"Revolution 9\\", an experimental piece that appeared on the Beatles' White Album. In December 1968, Lennon and Ono appeared together at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus with a supergroup named \\"The Dirty Mac\\", consisting of Eric Clapton, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and violinist Ivry Gitlis. Lennon and Ono continued with their experimental releases parallel to Lennon's activities in the Beatles, releasing Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions in May 1969. On 20 March 1969, Lennon and Ono married, and subsequently began their first \\"Bed-in for Peace\\" event. The event saw the new couple using press coverage of their marriage to advocate for peace. Recordings made around this time would be released as their third and final experimental album, Wedding Album. Lennon playing \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" in Montreal, 1969 Following the success of the first bed-in, Lennon and Ono held a second in Montreal in May. During the Bed-in, the couple and their guests recorded the Lennon-penned song \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and Ono's \\"Remember Love\\". These were released on 4 July as a single credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was the first single released by Lennon outside of the Beatles, with whom he was still active. Although an independent composition and release by Lennon, his Beatles writing partner Paul McCartney was still credited, as both a contractual and personal agreement of sharing credit. There is written and photographic evidence to suggest, however, that the original Plastic Ono Band was a sound and light installation set up in the Apple press office. In the 26th July, 1969 edition of 'Disc and Music Echo', Derek Taylor, the Beatles press officer, wrote the following article: 'The band was made in perspex in Hoylake, in Cheshire (where Selwyn Lloyd and I were brought up separately) by an inventor I know called Charles Melling. It was Yoko's idea, with John, made to her specifications; four pieces - like John,Paul,George and Ringo, three taller and one shorter. Two rectangular, one cylindrical and a cube. One column holds a tape-recorder and amplifier, another a closed circuit TV set with live camera, a third a record player with amplifier, and the fourth has a miniature light show and a loud speaker. But they could hold anything, they are as adaptable as the Beatles. The perspex columns were fitted with their equipment by Apple electronics under the direction of (Magic) Alexis Mardas and here ends the first and last technological press release you will have from me'. The single was preceded by a press launch for the Plastic Ono band on 3 July. According to Ono, the name was coined by Lennon as a result of Ono's use of plastic stands for recording. Press material outlined the \\"band\\" as a conceptual movement, not limited to a strict membership like a normal group. Lennon and Ono also stated that the audience were members, with the accompanying slogan \\"YOU are the Plastic Ono Band\\". =Toronto Rock Revival Festival and early singles (1969‚Äì1970)= The Plastic Ono Band remained dormant for most of the summer of 1969 as the Beatles worked on completing Abbey Road. On 12 September, Lennon received a call from John Brower, organizer of the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival (set to occur the following day), offering Lennon free attendance to the festival in order to boost its profile. Lennon offered instead to perform at the festival. Brower agreed, and Lennon quickly assembled a band. He initially approached Beatles bandmate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison turned him down. Eric Clapton (who had played guitar in Lennon's earlier live group, the Dirty Mac) was chosen instead. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White filled out the first performing lineup of the Plastic Ono Band. While organizing the band, Lennon privately decided to leave the Beatles, due to the tensions in the band at the time. The band rehearsed on the plane to Toronto, and performed both rock songs sung by Lennon and experimental pieces led by Ono. The show was recorded, and released in December as Live Peace in Toronto 1969, the first LP credited to the Plastic Ono Band.Live Peace in Toronto 1969 On 20 September, Lennon revealed to the other Beatles that he was leaving the band, although it was not revealed publicly at the time. A few days later, the Plastic Ono Band began the recording of their next single. \\"Cold Turkey\\" had been initially presented by Lennon as a potential Beatles single, but this was rejected by McCartney.Brown, Peter. The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of The Beatles. McGraw-Hill, 1983. New American Library, 2002. 331. \\"Cold Turkey\\" and its b-side \\"Don't Worry Kyoko\\" featured a Plastic Ono Band almost identical to the Toronto lineup except White was replaced by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. The writing credits for \\"Cold Turkey\\" featured only Lennon's name, reflecting his split with McCartney and the Beatles. Following the release of the \\"Cold Turkey\\" single, Lennon began preparations for a follow-up. On 26 November, he mixed \\"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\\" and \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\", for release as a single. Both songs were old Beatles recordings. \\"You Know My Name\\" dated initially from 1967, with further work by Lennon and McCartney in 1969. The b-side was a 1968 Lennon song originally intended for inclusion on the White Album. The single was put on hold by EMI, and was ultimately canceled, possibly due to objections from the Beatles. On 15 December, the Plastic Ono Band took part in a benefit concert for UNICEF at the Lyceum Ballroom in London, entitled \\"Peace for Christmas\\". With 48 hours' notice, Lennon and Ono assembled the Toronto lineup of the band (Clapton, Voorman, and White), with the addition of keyboardist Billy Preston. Clapton brought along the Delaney & Bonnie and Friends touring group, with whom he was touring at the time. In addition to Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, the group included Lennon's Beatles bandmate George Harrison, saxophonist Bobby Keys, drummer Jim Gordon, and trumpet player Jim Price. Keith Moon of the Who also joined the performance. Lennon would later refer to this lineup as \\"the Plastic Ono Supergroup\\". Following the performance, Lennon and Ono engaged in a media blitz and advertising campaign for peace, taking out billboards in major cities saying \\"WAR IS OVER! If You Want It ‚Äì Happy Christmas from John & Yoko\\". The new year saw the Plastic Ono Band reconvening to record another single. \\"Instant Karma!\\" was written and recorded on 27 January 1970, fulfilling Lennon's idea for an instant single. Lennon, Ono, George Harrison, Klaus Voorman, Alan White, and Billy Preston, along with backing vocalists recruited from a nearby pub, composed the POB for the session. On Harrison's suggestion, famed American producer Phil Spector was hired, beginning a working relationship that extended long into both his and Lennon's careers. \\"Instant Karma\\", backed with Ono's \\"Who Has Seen the Wind?\\", was released just over a week later. The single was credited to \\"Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band\\", in contrast to earlier releases, which were credited to the band alone. =Plastic Ono Band albums to \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" (1970‚Äì1971)= During the summer of 1970, Lennon and Ono undertook primal therapy under the guidance of Arthur Janov in Los Angeles. This therapy had a great effect on Lennon's writing. In the meantime, the Beatles had publicly broken up, and the pair returned to London at the end of September to begin recording on a pair of studio albums, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band. The core of the Plastic Ono Band backing the two was Klaus Voorman on bass and Ringo Starr on drums. Phil Spector produced the albums, and he and Billy Preston added keyboards to some select tracks. The Lennon album featured straightforward, stripped down rock, while Ono featured experimental and Avant-garde music. Both albums were released on 11 December, each to critical acclaim. The single \\"Mother\\"/\\"Why\\" was released, the songs coming from John Lennon and Yoko Ono respectively. Subsequently, \\"Power to the People\\" was recorded with a lineup of Billy Preston, Bobby Keys, Klaus Voorman, and Alan White. Ono's b-side \\"Open Your Box\\" featured Voorman and Jim Gordon. The single was released the following spring, with the sides credited to \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\\" respectively. In the spring and summer of 1971, Lennon and Ono respectively recorded Imagine and Fly. Despite the albums featuring regular members of the Plastic Ono Band (such as George Harrison, Klaus Voorman, Alan White, Jim Keltner, and Jim Gordon) and Phil Spector's production of Imagine, the albums were credited not to the Plastic Ono Band, but to Lennon and Ono as solo artists. On 6 June, Lennon and Ono performed with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention in New York City, dubbing the collaboration as the \\"Plastic Ono Mothers\\".Some Time in New York City (Inner sleeve). John Lennon and Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory & Invisible Strings. Apple, EMI. 1972. The next use of the Plastic Ono Band name was the 1971 Christmas single \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\". Credited to \\"John & Yoko/The Plastic Ono Band\\", the recording featured drummer Jim Keltner, pianist Nicky Hopkins (who had played on Imagine), and guitarists Hugh McCracken, Chris Osbourne (who had played on Fly), Teddy Irwin, and Stuart Scharf. The b-side \\"Listen, the Snow Is Falling\\" featured the same musicians as \\"Happy Xmas\\", with the addition of Klaus Voorman on bass. Produced by Phil Spector, the single was issued on 1 December. =Move to New York: Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band (1971‚Äì1973)= Ono and Lennon performing at a rally in December 1971 Lennon and Ono left the UK to settle in New York City during the fall of 1971. In Greenwich Village, the couple became more politically active and began writing protest songs. These songs became the basis for their next album, Some Time in New York City. As backing, they enlisted the help of New York band Elephant's Memory, consisting of guitarist Wayne 'Tex' Gabriel, bassist Gary Van Scyoc, saxophonist Stan Bronstein, keyboardist Adam Ippolito, keyboardist John La Boosca, and drummer Richard Frank, Jr. Phil Spector produced, and Jim Keltner also played on the album. The album was released on 12 June 1972, credited to \\"John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory plus Invisible Strings\\". Some Time in New York City included a second disc, entitled Live Jam, which included the recordings from the 1969 Peace for Christmas concert and the 1971 performance with Frank Zappa. Ono and Lennon continued their work with Elephant's Memory throughout 1972, performing as the Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band (which also included Jim Keltner). On 30 August, they performed a pair of benefit concerts at Madison Square Garden. The benefit, entitled \\"One to One\\", was organised by Geraldo Rivera to raise money for children with mental challenges. By this time, La Boosca had departed the band, and the concert saw the addition of John Ward on bass. The concert was filmed and recorded, later released in February 1986 as the album Live In New York City. They also performed at the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon. The last collaboration of the Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band was Ono's double album Approximately Infinite Universe. It was recorded throughout the fall of 1972, and was released in January 1973. =Lennon's split with Ono and the Lost Weekend (1973‚Äì1974)= By the beginning of 1973, recording had begun in earnest on Ono's next album, Feeling the Space, featuring a new group of studio musicians. The newest incarnation of the Plastic Ono Band featured guitarist David Spinozza, keyboardist Ken Ascher, bassist Gordon Edwards, percussionists Arthur Jenkins and David Friedman, saxophonist Michael Brecker, pedal steel guitarist Sneaky Pete Kleinow, as well as regular contributor Jim Keltner. The album would be released in November. Throughout 1973, Lennon and Ono's relationship became strained. By August, the two had begun a period of separation that Lennon called \\"The Lost Weekend\\". Lennon began the recording of his own album, Mind Games, using the same players as on Feeling the Space, dubbed \\"The Plastic U.F.Ono Band\\". Around the time of the album's release in November, Lennon moved to Los Angeles with new lover May Pang. In October, Lennon began the recording of an album of rock 'n' roll oldies (a contractual obligation due to a lawsuit). These featured many Plastic Ono Band regulars (including much of the \\"U.F.Ono Band\\", Klaus Voorman, and the return of Phil Spector to the production chair), but upon release in 1975 as Rock 'n' Roll, it was credited to Lennon alone. The sessions for Rock 'n' Roll were extremely troubled, and the sessions were abandoned until a later date. In July 1974, Lennon returned to New York to record Walls and Bridges. The new \\"Plastic Ono Nuclear Band\\" featured both old and new faces, with Jim Keltner, Kenneth Ascher, and Arthur Jenkins continuing from Mind Games, the returns of Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, and Bobby Keys, and the addition of guitarists Jesse Ed Davis and Eddie Mottau.Walls and Bridges (Booklet). John Lennon. Apple, EMI. 1974. Recording was finished in August, and the album was released 26 September and 4 October in the US and UK respectively. Walls and Bridges would prove to be the last release of new material by the Plastic Ono Band in the 1970s. Lennon subsequently returned to his marriage with Ono and retired from music following the birth of his son Sean. The compilation Shaved Fish was released in October 1975, Lennon's last release credited to the Plastic Ono Band. Upon his and Ono's return to music in 1980 for the album Double Fantasy, they played with an all-new group of studio musicians who were not billed as any variation of the Plastic Ono Band name. Lennon was shot and killed shortly after the release of the album. =Revival (2009‚Äì2015)= Ono in 2010 In 2009, Yoko Ono revived the Plastic Ono Band name with the 2009 EP Don't Stop Me!, a preview of the album Between My Head and the Sky. Both albums, and subsequent activities, are credited to the \\"Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band\\". The core members of the new Plastic Ono Band are Sean Lennon (the son of Ono and Lennon), Cornelius (Keigo Oyamada) and Yuka Honda. Since 2009, the band has performed live concerts, with additional members including bassist Shimmy Hirotaka Shimizu, horn player Michael Leonhart, cellist Erik Friedlander, and drummer Yuko Araki. They have also performed with many guest performers, including Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Bette Midler, Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Scissor Sisters, Harper Simon, Paul Simon and Gene Ween. In 2010, at a concert entitled \\"We Are the Plastic Ono Band\\", Ono and Sean Lennon reunited with Eric Clapton, Klaus Voorman, and Jim Keltner. In 2011, Ono and Lennon collaborated with The Flaming Lips on an EP entitled The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band. The latest release from the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band is the 2013 album Take Me to the Land of Hell. The Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band continued to make live appearances into 2015.

Argentine rock began by recycling hits of English-language rock & roll. However a rising trend of composing new songs mostly in Spanish can be traced at late 1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing songs and lyrics that related to local social and musical themes. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, being widely considered the most prolific and successful form of Rock en Espa√±ol, and the most important non-English language form of rock music in the world. A distinguishing trait of Argentine rock is its insistence on Spanish language lyrics. It's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing in a foreign language as is common in other countries (except to convey a sense of artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine Rock Nacional is one of the principal predecessors of the cultural and musical movement in Latin America known since the 80's as Rock Latino. Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina. Related genre Several terms are used to describe the artistic expressions of rock and roll in Iberian America, which are often confused or given different meanings in different countries. Generally, these terms are: *Iberian American Rock: includes all expressions of rock and roll by natives of Latin American countries and Spain. This includes Brazilian rock and rock sung in English, Portuguese, and Native American languages. *Rock en Espa√±ol: includes all rock sung in Spanish. *Latin Rock: includes all expressions of rock and roll in Latin American countries, the Caribbean, and the Latin American community of the United States. In addition to rock sung in Spanish, this includes rock sung in English, Portuguese, French, and other Latin-based languages. This generally refers to a cultural movement that began in the 80's throughout Latin America. *Rock Nacional in Argentina: refers to a movement of progressive music that rapidly gained popularity in 1967 with the song \\"La Balsa\\". *Argentine rock: refers to all expressions of rock performed in Argentina, regardless of language and subgenre.  1958‚àí1964: Early rock and roll  Sandro y Los del Fuego in 1961. Rock and roll first began to appear in Argentina in 1956 after the genre was created in the United States in 1954-1955, based largely on rhythm and blues and country and western. Elvis Presley and Bill Haley (who visited Argentina in 1958) awakened the interest of several Argentine artists. The most notable among Argentine garage bands which sprung up in this period was Sandro y Los de Fuego, who recorded a successful series of Spanish language covers of American rock and roll hits, and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular internationally. Others include Eddie Pequenino, Los Cinco Latinos and Billy Cafaro. 1964‚àí1975: The classic period The first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands. In 1964, Argentina, like much of the rest of the world, was shaken by The Beatles phenomenon.A Very Brief Story of Argentine Rock www.elortiba.org (Spanish) There was a development unique to Argentina which may help to explain, in retrospect, why the country would become a very important rock music-producing nation. Historians describe a parallel pattern of development with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming Bluegrass and Country in the US, in Argentina Folklore and Pampas music. Country music is an important pillar of Rock & Roll. In Argentina folklore (at that time Nueva canci√≥n was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s. =Late 60s beat music= Los Gatos, circa 1968. By 1965, rock music was developing rapidly in Argentina. On television, several shows such as Ritmo y Juventud and El Club del Clan, with singers like Palito Ortega, Violeta Rivas, Chico Navarro, and Lalo Fransen, featured a poppy version of rock, which owed equal amounts to Merseybeat and to Argentine and Italian romantic pop.Brief History of Argentine rock Rockerosargentinos.com.ar/paghistorock.htm (Spanish) But it was in the underground where the most influential figures of early Argentine rock would emerge. In former Jazz bars like \\"La Cueva\\" or \\"La Perla del Once\\", bohemians like Moris, Pajarito Zaguri, Javier Martinez - drummer and lead singer in the most known Argentine blues band Manal - Miguel Abuelo, and Tanguito would gather in the lazy days of mid-1960s Argentina to exchange ideas. Los Beatnicks, of which Moris and Martinez where members, began the transition that would slowly take Argentine rock from imitation to a more creative state (while still following UK trends mainly). Forming in quiet beaches of Villa Gesell, they recorded the first Spanish language single in 1966 called \\"Rebelde\\".Chapter 2 History of Argentine Rock (Spanish) The definitive breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock would be up to the band Los Gatos. After playing in \\"La Cueva\\" for a few months (and members of the band being arrested on a regular basis by police, for political reasons), the band released two singles in 1967. \\"La Balsa\\", a sunny track vaguely reminiscent of The Doors, co-written by Tanguito and Litto Nebbia, sold 200,000 copies; this contributed to the widespread popularity of the genre due to it being sung in Spanish and being an original composition, as opposed to a cover of a foreign song. The following year saw the first publication of Pinap, a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, Mandioca. In 1969, four major concerts of so-called \\"m√∫sica beat\\" (\\"beat music\\") were held: the June Sunday concerts, Festival Nacional de M√∫sica Beat, Festival Pinap and Festival de M√∫sica Joven. Almendra and Manal in a poster for Pelo magazine, circa 1970. In the wake of Los Gatos, an explosion of bands emerged including Luis Alberto Spinetta's Almendra, the most influential band of the late 1960s, and Manal, the first successful blues-oriented group in Spanish. The three are considered the founders of the Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history: in fact most disbanded by the early 1970s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterised by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. However, the shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity. Almendra would split with Spinetta forming Pescado Rabioso, and the remaining members forming Color Humano and Aquelarre. Spinetta's album Artaud (incorrectly credited to the-then disbanded Pescado Rabioso due to his record label contract) it is widely considered the greatest Argentine rock album of all time. By 1970, Vox Dei and their unique mixture of hard nosed rock with subtle melodious undertones refreshed the movement. Their album \\"La Biblia\\" (The Bible) is one of the seminal works of the early 1970s, even getting an unusual stamp of approval by the Catholic Church. In that same year, the first B.A (Buenos Aires) Rock festival would be the first showcase of a rising subgenre that would dominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock.The Beginnings ABC of Argentine Rock (Spanish) A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock. That the original creators of the movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries the original wave in the wake of the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not only did it continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the United States or Britain. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.The History of Rock en Espa√±ol by Gregorio Montiel Cupello (Spanish) =Acoustic and heavy rock= Electric guitarist Pappo, frontman of Pappo's Blues, performing in 1973. By the turn of the decade the first real diversification in Argentine rock began taking place. In reality, the split had been brewing even before, as some bands began playing much heavier music, with the world of rock entering the Heavy metal era. Among them, Pescado Rabioso, Vox Dei, and Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock. But out of all of the heavy rock bands, Pappo's Blues would become the most influential heavy metal band and blues artist of its era in Argentina, and also acclaimed overseas (even playing with B.B. King in New York City). Another important but overlooked heavy rock act of the period is El Reloj, but they would drift towards progressive rock in the following years. Conversely, the first B.A Rock festival (now promoted by Pinap magazine successor Revista Pelo), had many of the artists and bands that would lead the Acoustic rock movement: Gustavo Santaolalla forming Arco Iris, Le√≥n Gieco's folk-rock hybrid, Sui Generis and the start of Charly Garc√≠a's music career, Raul Porchetto, and Pedro y Pablo, among other bands. These groups not only turned to Argentine folk for inspiration, they began experimenting with South American musical styles as well; their lyrics becoming increasingly poetic with concerns about nature and the human condition. The proliferation of these bands and their increasing popularity, the early 1970s being the height of the hippie movement in Argentina, led to the Acusticazo of 1972. Several acoustic rock bands would gain popularity from their performances there, including Vivencia, Pastoral, and Alma y Vida. The behemothic success of the Acusticazo was a turning point, Argentine rock would enter a new era of increased greater appeal.National Rock during the Dictatorship (Spanish) In that year also, Tanguito was killed when he was hit by a train. Conspiracies about his death abound, including that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown onto the tracks by police. A heavy user of drugs, others contend he simply might have tripped.The Acusticazos (Spanish) The 1993 motion picture Tango Feroz (\\"Wild Tango\\"), would tell the life of Tanguito to new generations and the movie was an international hit. As the 1970s progressed, acoustic rock continued as the most popular style in the country, with the above-mentioned and other bands dominating the charts and musical tastes. And for the first time in its history, Argentine rock began spreading overseas: Sui Generis and Pastoral attained some popularity with counter-culture hippies in Latin America, and even Japan (Pastoral had an EP edited there).Chapter 9 History of Argentine Rock (Spanish) But a major shift was at hand. =Sui Generis farewell concerts= Charly Garcia during Sui Generis farewell concerts, 1975 Sui Generis began shifting from their classic acoustic rock to a more electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal Agitor Lucens V with its world music influences), by Tango music and also by British progressive rock. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into the apex of the movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too. Charly Garc√≠a and Nito Mestre decided it was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most important acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people.Sui Generis (Spanish) Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre. The Classic era of Argentine rock music was completely over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including Pastoral, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. But it was the beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.  1975‚àí1983: The intermediate period  = Progressive rock = Invisible in 1974. As early as 1973, the band Contraluz combined rock with progressive and folk tinges. They would be an influential group in the years leading to the rise of symphonic and Argentine progressive rock. It would create some of the most enjoyable and brilliant albums in the history of the music, acclaimed nationally and by progressive rock fans worldwide. Perhaps the first major act of symphonic/progressive was Crucis. Their music began attracting attention in the underground, and so they started getting bigger performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with surprising breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar (often spectacular wah-wah) and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.Crucis www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource Esp√≠ritu, who formed in 1973 but had roots since 1969, would go on to be an internationally followed group in the latter part of symphonic rock's heyday. The first album Crisalida is cited as their best effort, with beautiful and alternating compositions and changing atmospheres (from mellow with acoustic guitar to up-tempo with heavy electric guitar), lush keyboards and some vocal harmonies.Espiritu www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource Former heavy rockers El Reloj turned to prog with 1975's self-titled album. Their sound has been compared to Uriah Heep's mystic and proggy sound.El Reloj www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource A symphonic band that would have a great year in 1976 was ALAS. Their music was even more intellectual and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as Rodolfo Mederos and Pedro Aznar. Luis Alberto Spinetta would begin his third band Invisible later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with tango would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialised was Reino de Munt. Formed by Raul Porchetto, it featured a young Alejandro Lerner, and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck. Charly Garc√≠a formed his first post-Sui Generis band, La M√°quina de Hacer P√°jaros, which began Garcia's explorations of symphonic and progressive rock. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be Torax, Ave Rock, Anacrusa, and Materia Gris. Arco Iris meanwhile continued expanding on their symphonic-folk rock and were joined by veteran Chilean band Los Jaivas, whom were escaping the Pinochet dictatorship that had come to power in their nation in 1973. The two along with Contraluz were the main exponent of the subgenre. On March 24, 1976, the democratic government was toppled by a military coup. It opened one of the darkest political chapters in Argentina's history, full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst period of censorship in its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation's authority figures, who began to clamp down on the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral Emilio Massera denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives and repression of them began in 1977. Before the end of the decade, rock had gone increasingly underground. Rock Nacional avoided the government's heavy media censorship and allowed an outlet for codified criticism of the government. In spite of this however, the music would continue its development against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies Vox Dei and Pappo's Blues continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, Plus, made their debut in '76 and enjoyed success through the end of the decade. = Symphonic rock at late 1970s = Argentine rock continued its symphonic, so-called 'concert hall' sound through the end of the decade. The '78-'79 period was not the most prolific period for rock, as the progressive bands continued with their blueprint, and symphonic rock bands actually turned slightly commercial. At the height of symphonic rock, Crucis was joined at the top by the popularity of Esp√≠ritu; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. La M√°quina de Hacer P√°jaros efforts were impressive as well, their first album featuring many of the elements of good prog: intricate ensemble work, good individual performances, great melodies, dynamic contrast, and interesting arrangements.La Maquina de Hacer Pajaros Soluna, 1976. 1977 was a year of separation and endings: Crucis would disband at the end of the year. In heavy metal, Pappo's blues would see their nearly seven-year run end. Aquelarre would return from their Spanish stint, but following a tour run went their separate ways. But the year would show a glimpse at the future: a band from La Plata called Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 was a year of one-year wonders: Soluna (Gustavo Santaolalla's 2nd group), with their electric folk, and Orion's Beethoven, a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978.Chapter 11 History of Argentine Rock (Spanish) Bubu with their album Anabelas was 1978's one-year wonder. And even more bands ceased to be. After two successful albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La M√°quina de Hacer P√°jaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy three of the greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: Invisible, Durazno Sangrando and Jardin de los Presentes. Pastoral, one of the last acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock. Throughout its history, Argentine rock had the strange fortune to get exactly what in needed at the right time, fuelling an even greater expansion in the music. Sandro y los del fuego in '63 with their Argentine rockabilly igniting inspiration; the Uruguayan Invasion of 1965 that proved the commercial viability of non-US or UK bands; the massive hit of \\"La balsa\\" by Los Gatos in '67 showing Spanish language rock could be appealing to the masses; the Acusticazo of '72. In the drought days of 1978, what Argentine rock needed was its first successful 'supergroup'. It got it in Ser√∫ Gir√°n. = Ser√∫ Gir√°n = In 1977 Charly Garc√≠a got together with his friend David Leb√≥n, an ex member of Luis Alberto Spinetta's famous band Pescado Rabioso, to write songs in Brazil. There Charly re-encountered Oscar Moro, the drummer of his former band \\"La M√°quina De Hacer P√°jaros\\" and they decided to invite him to help compose new material. The trio soon decided that instead of selling their songs like they had originally planned, they would play them themselves in a new band. Now all they needed was a bass player. Pedro Aznar was a lesser known bassist who had once been a member of progressive rock group \\"ALAS\\". He also happened to be a friend of Moro's, who knew of Aznar's ability with the funk and jazz bass. Moro brought Aznar into the group and they began to prepare themselves. Charly, Moro, Leb√≥n, and Aznar managed two major things with Ser√∫ Gir√°n. The first was to create a sound that was truly distinctive from anything in English-language rock. The second was their ability to massively achieve popularity in the lower and upper classes with their style of rock. Ser√∫ Gir√°n could be 'brainy' yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously. Partly because the group lived for three months in northeast Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created one of the strangest anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song \\"Disco Shock\\", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and what should have been a great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed to get the message and Ser√∫ Gir√°n did not get their point across too well either. It would all fuel wild speculations about the members' sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.Ser√∫ Gir√°n www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) But the group bounced back with a vengeance with their 2nd album La Grasa de las Capitales. It was well received by the specialist press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time.Pelo Magazine #122 (Spanish) Ser√∫ Gir√°n's third album Bicicleta (1980) was tepidly received at first, but in time would be considered the band's best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and 'simple' with less arrangement and pomp. Ser√∫ Gir√°n would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period. = Argentine rock and Falklands War = The nation was still in the grip of a dictatorship as the 1980s dawned, even as repression had eased somewhat by then. The start of the decade continued to feature Ser√∫ Gir√°n, now with their less pretentious sound, at the top of the charts. Vox Dei entered their 3rd decade in rock, a virtual first for any local band, and Le√≥n Gieco's popularity as a solo artist was on the rise. One of the last progressive bands of importance would be Tantor. They were less symphonic and far more prog-experimental, with jazz as a major support. Their first eponymous album was a hit in the scene, and the band would continue till the mid-1980s as one of the last bands of the progressive era.The Progressive and Symphonic in the Argentinean Ser√∫ Gir√°n went touring in Brazil in 1980, where their reception by fans at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro was so overwhelming that the organizers requested that they perform again, the next day, but on the main stage with jazz-rockers Weather Report. There, Pedro Aznar met Pat Metheny, and Aznar gave him some cassettes with his own works. Ser√∫ Gir√°n returned home, released \\"Bicicleta\\" and gathered 60,000 fans in La Rural back in Buenos Aires chanting no se banca m√°s (it isn't bearable anymore, alluding to the dictatorship). That year they had also performed in concert with Spinetta Jade, Luis Alberto Spinetta's latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s. It was a great event in which both bands eventually played some songs of each other's repertoire. Spinetta Jade was a blend of jazz and rock that escaped the trappings of symphonic rock, something that was unheard in Argentina at that time. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more \\"pop\\", and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesizers with \\"artificial\\" textures).Luis Alberto Spinetta Wikipedia- The Free Encyclopedia Ser√∫ Gir√°n released their fourth album Peperina in 1981 and promoted it on tour, but by the end of the year Pedro Aznar decided to leave the band because he wanted to study at Berklee. (When he was there, by the end of 1982, he was called to join the Pat Metheny Group). Ser√∫ Gir√°n (which at the time was even planning tours in Europe), had a strong sendoff on March 6‚Äì7, 1982, when they performed for the last time at the Arena Obras Sanitarias. A memorable moment was the performance of the song \\"No llores por mi Argentina\\" (\\"Don't Cry for me Argentina\\", which has no relation to the Evita musical theme); a song full of symbolism. It was not only a farewell for Aznar, and for Ser√∫ Gir√°n, but for an era in Argentine music, and history. The timing was beyond befitting. Argentina's economy was in full recession in 1982, and discontent with the military government was rampant. On April 2, the world would awake yet again in the 20th century to the horror of war. After a season of death and destruction in the South Atlantic in which both sides suffered sunken ships, aircraft blown from the sky, and hundreds of young lives were cut short, the United Kingdom regained control over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). The popularity of the Argentine military government hit then bottom, and democratic elections were called shortly after.  1983‚àí1990: Argentine rock goes global  = New Democracy Sound = The war would be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the paradoxical effect of creating one of the most fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre. In May of '82 the Festival for Latin American Solidarity brought together all the great bands of Argentine rock. It was a festival in support of the troops overseas, and also a veiled protest to war, and a call for peace (at first the musicians feared appearing for risk of being portrayed pro-war). This event was the final stepping stone of Argentine rock in becoming the dominant form of music in the country. At the same time, English-language rock was wiped out from radio play. The programmers had to fill the voids with something, and that was with Argentine rock.Ayer Nom√°s (Only Yesterday) (Spanish) This created the opportunity of exposure to countless underground bands. It would set the foundations for the explosion of rock in the mid-1980s. In the latter days of symphonic rock, a great number of new groups started popping seemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands influenced by post-punk, new wave from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in La Plata, Federico Moura would form a pioneering new wave band called Virus. In Buenos Aires, three young men influenced by the advent of post-punk in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name Soda Stereo. In 1980 friends who were enthralled by the wave of US and UK punk formed the band Los Violadores. Miguel Abuelo, a founding figure of Argentine rock in the 1960s, would return after a decade in Europe and form Los Abuelos de la Nada, which happened to feature a young man by the name of Andres Calamaro. Someone named Miguel Mateos, after talking to Freddie Mercury, won the opportunity to open for Queen in Buenos Aires with his new band ZAS. At the local pubs in Mendoza a pop-rock act called Los Enanitos Verdes appeared. An Italian of Scottish background named Luca Prodan arrived in Argentina to fight his heroin addiction, worsened by the death of his friend Ian Curtis of Joy Division. Prodan would form Sumo. This band, one of the least conventional in Argentina at the time, and since, has been voted Best Argentine Band by a poll composed by rock journalists in 2009. Despite its 'underground' status, it has fervent followers in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and a plethora of countries worldwide. From the Festival of Latin American Solidarity emerged solo artists that would go on to delve into a more adult oriented form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from Rosario named Fito P√°ez), Alejandro Lerner, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, Pappo founded his new band Riff, and newcomers V8 and La Torre would emerge. New witty rock bands like Los Twist, Su√©ter, and the riot grrrl group Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation.ABC Rock Argentino (Spanish) On the gothic side of rock, La Sobrecarga and Euroshima would carry the torch. And for the first time in Argentine rock history there was a \\"revival\\" of an earlier style, with Acoustic rock making a comeback on the back of reunions by Almendra and Manal. On the other hand, Charly Garc√≠a and Luis Alberto Spinetta embarked on their solo careers. Moris returned from his period in Spain. Meanwhile, Argentina entered a new era with the inauguration of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n as president of a fully democratic nation. Rock bands would no longer be harassed and even censored by the powers-that- be, and freedom of expression flowered. Songs critical of the military that were in prior years censored, some with exquisite lyrical poetry and allegory, were released during this time: \\"Tiempos Dificiles\\" by Fito P√°ez (sung by Juan Carlos Baglietto), \\"Maribel se Durmi√≥\\" by Luis Alberto Spinetta, \\"S√≥lo le pido a Dios\\" by Le√≥n Gieco and \\"Los dinosaurios\\" by Charly Garc√≠a. A more direct criticism of the military government that ended in 1983 came from the Argentine punk groups like Los Violadores (singing songs like \\"Represi√≥n\\") or seminal heavy metal bands like V8. Finally, segments of Argentine rock moved away from the concert hall and 'solemn' era, full of very heavy lyrics and concerns with domestic issues. It started to lighten up and turn more irreverent, and to focus on mundane concerns such as money, love, and sports. This would make the music and lyrics far more accessible (and commercial) to international audiences. The stage was set for the boom of Argentine rock in Latin America and beyond. = Argentine Invasion = The Cafe Einstein was opened in 1982 by Omar Chaban (who would end up convicted for the Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire 22 years later), featuring some of the first presentations of three underground bands: Sumo, Soda Stereo, and Los Twist. Both Sumo and Soda Stereo featured slightly different line-ups in their early days, with Sumo having an English girl, Stephanie Nuttal, on drums. She returned to England when war broke out between her country and Argentina.Chapter 21 History of Argentine Rock(Spanish) Also in '82 Charly Garc√≠a released his full-album solo debut, the acclaimed Yendo de la Cama al Living. \\"One could feel the winds of change\\" in 1983 Argentina. A clich√© perhaps, but at no time more appropriately used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: it was the year the compact disc was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: Patricia Sosa and her heavy rock band La Torre were voted best band of the year and \\"Solo quiero Rock and Roll\\" best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female-fronted band, Los Twist, and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when Fabiana Cantilo left. As the early 1980s progressed it became clear that the new generation of rockers were not like anything before: Los Violadores pioneering punk in Latin America; Virus oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by Cosm√©ticos with a similar style ; Sumo's punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following (Luca Prodan sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and Soda Stereo the buzz of the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase \\"rock en tu idioma\\" (rock in your language).Miguel Mateos www.rock.com.mx (Spanish) Los Abuelos de la Nada and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come. By 1985, year in which Los Fabulosos Cadillacs were formed, several bands began receiving consistent airplay across Latin America. Argentine rock began \\"climbing\\" the continent up the Andes: first Chile, then Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela. Zeta Bosio member of Soda Stereo said regarding this: \\"We would leave Argentina and tour in Chile, Peru, etc, and in some places they had never heard a live rock concert before... they said that such music was for another world and wouldn‚Äôt work... now it's all joy seeing how it did work and that it now has its own legs...\\" Argentine rock bands were the first to be signed to multinational record labels for distribution across many nations. The trickle became a flood as 1986 approached, and by the start of that year it had become a continental phenomenon, reaching Central America, Mexico, and crossing the Atlantic to Spain, even as far Italy, France, and Germany. Los Enanitos Verdes, with their energetic pop-rock that appealed through music lines, gained previously unseen popularity across borders. The Cadillacs, with their ska-rock with a heavy Latin infusion, turned into instant rock stars across Latin America and, eventually, worldwide. Rata Blanca, a heavy metal band formed in 1987 from the ashes of influential early 1980s rockers called V8, also conquered the Spanish-speaking world. The same did Charly Garc√≠a, Fito P√°ez, and now solo artist Miguel Mateos. 1986 was the climax of an unprecedented wave of international success for Argentine rock. It would help to revitalize rock movements in other Latin American countries for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes; 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that \\"Rock en Espa√±ol\\" could work and make them money. In Mexico, Argentine bands were being marketed by media giants like Televisa as \\"rock in your language\\".Remembering La Onda through the literature of Jos√© Agust√≠n and La Onda roquera (rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll in M√©xico) by Roberto Avant-Mier Its success changed the landscape of the Mexican scene: it laid the groundwork for Mexican rock in Spanish to itself expand overseas. In Peru, the Argentine invasion was a catalyst that brought that country's own movement more to the mainstream.They Are Peruvian and they are good Peruvian Rock (Spanish). Archived 2009-10-25. In Chile, where a few outstanding bands existed even prior to the Argentine boom (see Los Prisioneros), the flood of rock music coming from their eastern neighbor would fully energize and inspire the local scene, and Argentine rock's influence continues to this day.Celestes, azules, blancos, rojos y amarillos Influence of Argentine Rock in Chile (Spanish)- by Mauricio Fredes The current boom in Colombian rock can be traced to the 1980s, with most Colombian rock acts citing the Argentine invasion groups as a direct influence.Rock y Pop www.Colombia.com (Spanish) In countries like Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia, the effects were even more profound. As 1988 began, with the most important Argentine bands (Soda Stereo, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Enanitos Verdes, Rata Blanca, Charly Garc√≠a, Andres Calamaro, Miguel Mateos, Sumo, Virus) on constant tour of Latin America, Europe, and even countries in Asia, the globalization of Argentine rock and pop was complete. By this time the invasion had begun to 'quiet' down in comparison to the prior three years, but its legacy of opening the doors of Argentine rock to massive success beyond its own borders remains to this day. = Soda Stereo = Soda Stereo in concert. Soda Stereo was one of the most successful and influential rock band in Spanish ever. The influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even 'business acumen' is undeniable. They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as The Police, Television, and Talking Heads, and by symphonic rockers Luis Alberto Spinetta and Aquelarre. With their first album, the self-titled Soda Stereo (1984), they reached national success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and a sound that combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, Nada Personal, strengthened the popularity of the band, with instant classics such as \\"Nada Personal\\" and \\"Cuando Pase el Temblor\\" opening the doors of the Latin American market; 1986's \\"Signos\\" would heavily increase their popularity and in 1988 they came up with what could arguably be called their masterpiece, their album \\"Doble Vida\\". The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety never heard before from the band's production, the most notable example being the album's lead single \\"En La Ciudad De La Furia\\", a cryptically metaphorical ode to the band's hometown of Buenos Aires and the city's inhabitants. They embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America that brought the live album Ruido Blanco.Artist A-Z Biography: Soda Stereo www.VH1.com With the tour supporting Signos, Soda Stereo became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success well into the 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds unlike almost any other Rock en Espa√±ol band. In fact, they would lead the way in the changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near. = Late '80s: Loss and Experimentation = The year 1987 ended in tragedy for Argentine rock. Luca Prodan had finally lost his personal battle with alcohol and was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction.Luca Prodan/Sumo (Spanish) His death was a shock to the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans. Following Prodan's death, the members of Sumo split, founding two new rock outfits: Divididos and Las Pelotas; both bands became major players of 1990s rock. Miguel Abuelo, following gallbladder surgery, was diagnosed with AIDS; terminally ill, he died from cardiac arrest on March 26, 1988. Virus leader Federico Moura's persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with AIDS.Estrenos en ONCE TV: Virus www.rock.com.mx (Spanish) Moura died on December 21, 1988. Moura's passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. It was a tough blow for rock. As a group, Virus survived and soldiered on into the 1990s as a more adult pop-rock outfit than the outrageous yet influential 1980s band that helped define the sound of \\"techno-pop\\". Three major trends defined the Argentine rock of the end of the 1980s. The first trend was the consolidation of the Argentine Invasion bands into somewhat more mature rock groups. Some began to experiment with world music in the last two years of the 1980s. For example, Charly Garc√≠a got together with his old Ser√∫ Gir√°n partner Pedro Aznar and recorded \\"Tango\\", whose name accurately suggests the style of the album. Excerpt at Before Federico Moura's death, Virus had also begun turning to Brazilian music for their album Superficies de Placer. In general the mood of the music got darker echoing a deteriorated economic climate. A second was the rise of \\"Tropical\\" rock, and the explosion of local Reggae bands in Argentina seemingly out of nowhere in 1987. While Argentine rock was triumphant internationally, Argentina was caught in a reggae-mania: in the summer of that year arose Los Pericos, Los Cafres, La Zimbabwe, and Jafran, among many other smaller outfits. But it was a fad, and only Los Pericos would sustain and grow their careers once the fancy fadedZimbabwe www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) (Los Cafres would be mildly successful starting in 1994). A band that was not a fad was Los Aut√©nticos Decadentes, who would become a hugely popular ska-Latin pop and ballad group. They along with Los Pericos and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs would be leaders in the tropical rock scene of ska, reggae and Latin music. The third trend came about partly as a result of the first: many rock fans did not approve of the commercialism and experimentation of the A-bands, and increasingly looked underground for a more confrontational guitar-led rock. Among them: Todos Tus Muertos, Don Cornelio y La Zona (later Los Visitantes), Los Brujos, Babas√≥nicos, Los Siete Delfines, Massacre Palestina. All of them would be part of the \\"Nuevo Rock\\" (\\"New Rock\\") explosion of the early 1990s. In heavy metal, the already mentioned Rata Blanca dominated popular tastes, specially in other Latin American countries, along with Herm√©tica, JAF, and Horcas (the last two more domestic), in a very healthy scene for a style that never was overwhelmingly crowded in Argentine rock. An important band in the metal underground was Nepal, one of the pioneering bands of thrash metal. Formed in 1984, they were part of the first generation of worldwide thrashers, and gained prominence as the decade ended and musical tastes turned approbatory for more extreme metal. The genre got many magazines committed solely to it and distributed nationwide: Madhouse, Metal, Riff Raff, Revista Epopeya, etc. The end of the 1980s were also a period of continued growth for Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, on their way to becoming one of the most mythic cult bands of broad popularity in the history of rock, anywhere. It was also the time when Los Ratones Paranoicos were gaining followers with the burgeoning \\"rolingas\\" (followers of a subgenre of Argentine rock that is greatly indebted to the Rolling Stones). On the pop side Man Ray with their tailor-made FM songs were ubiquitous. Finally, Divididos and their guitar-crunching melodic noise was more and more becoming a preview of what the next decade would bring. In general, as the fantastic 1980s for Argentine rock closed, the music was in period of transition and exploration at all levels.  1990‚àí1998: The Contemporary Period  = \\"Canci√≥n Animal\\" and New Rock = Soda Stereo's frontman Gustavo Cerati could foresee the musical trends, putting his own band in front of it. After releasing the increasingly hard rocking Doble Vida, the band headed to studio with new producer Daniel Melero to record their fifth album, Canci√≥n Animal. It was released in October 1990, about a year before Nirvana released Nevermind. Canci√≥n Animal confirmed that it was OK to return Argentine rock to an 'in your face', edgy attitude that shaped the Argentine Invasion aesthetic in the early years of the 1980s, but this time with electric guitars as the stars. From that album, the single \\"De M√∫sica Ligera\\", might well be the most recognizable Spanish-language rock single of all time, and also one of the most covered by bands all over Latin America and elsewhere. Canci√≥n Animal helped underground acts like Los Brujos, Peligrosos Gorriones, and Massacre break faster into the mainstream, by taking guitar-crunching rock to the apex as 1991 began. Even pop-bound groups like Los Enanitos Verdes rocked harder in their early 1990s works, particularly in their Big Bang album, whose single \\"Lamento Boliviano\\" is now a classic. These and other bands in their wake would be dubbed the \\"Nuevo Rock Argentino\\", or New Argentine Rock. A term that not long after would also be used as an umbrella to group bands with a hard- to-pin-down style, like the neo-surf pop of Super Ratones (from Mar del Plata), and neo-fusionists La Portuaria with their world music touches. \\"Nuevo Rock\\" would be the dominant form of rock in Argentina until the middle of the decade when it lost ground to so-called \\"rock suburbano\\". In 1992, Soda Stereo presented Dynamo, their sixth album, arguably the most conceptual (the other being \\"Signos\\"), and the most experimental to that point. It apparently took fans by surprise, and was the lowest seller of the group's works (it didn't help that in the middle of all this the band changed labels; Sony wouldn‚Äôt promote a band that was leaving, and BMG wouldn't promote another label's album). Babas√≥nicos, 2006. On the other hand, Babas√≥nicos had in 1992 their first major breakthrough of their careers with the hit D-generaci√≥n from their 1992 album Pasto, which would herald future international success for a band that would define the sound of \\"sonic\\" rock.Babas√≥nicos ABC Rock Argentino- Artistas (Spanish). Archived 2009-10-25. Juana La Loca was another band in the so-called sonic scene that started in the early 1990s and would breakthrough a few years later. The band that founded the Sonic Movement in Buenos Aires was Iguana Lovers, started in 1990.Iguana Lovers, The Sound of Confusion, excellent shoegaze from Buenos Aires started in 1990 Now with collaborations of the shoegazeShoegaze-A journey through gaze British indie Ride members, Mark Gardener and Loz Colbert, they were positioned as the most important new band of the Buenos Aires indie scene in 1991. Los Brujos would have a great year 1992; the single \\"Kanishka\\" was an instant chart-topper. Los Visitantes equalled the success of Los Brujos the next year with their album Salud Universal, an offbeat mix of guitar rock and tango tinges. Todos Tus Muertos was a punk response to the Argentine rock being made in the late 1980s, consciously choosing to be far more direct and explicit in their musical (and political) statements. The band gained rapid acclaim with the rise of New Rock, and were one of the favorite bands of the period. Slowly the group would evolve from their early punk to a more diverse style that include afro-Latin rhythms. Iguana Lovers, 1990 The odd-group out that appeared in the early 1990s was the outrageously named Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas (a reference to Colombian footballer Carlos Valderrama). More rappers than rockers, the group nonetheless made a mark in the rock scene as time progressed and they were able to more successfully integrate rap with Argentine rock, and also Latin rhythms. One of the members, Dante, is the son of Luis Alberto Spinetta. = Rock rolinga = As New Rock was dominant, some acts in the distant suburbs of Buenos Aires where playing straightforward and guitar centered rock music, with a foundation in the blues, and an unsophisticated image (somewhat a counter-movement to the image conscious, musically more pretentious New Rock). Some of these suburban acts owed so much to the sound of the Rolling Stones, that their followers came to be known as \\"rolingas\\". Eventually the rock rolinga (a.k.a. rock stone) became a style: cheesy 1970s sneakers, tight T-shirts with the logo of the Stones or a local 'stone' band, and a disdain for other Argentine rock subgenres they consider part of the establishment. At the forefront of this movement were Los Ratones Paranoicos, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come.http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/05/09/espectaculos/c-00615.htm They were joined in the Rolinga scene by Viejas Locas in the mid 1990s. The incessant touring of the rolinga bands around the suburbs of Buenos Aires and other cities would reap benefits not only for themselves but for other suburban groups that would follow soon after. Thus, Rolinga rock arguably became the most popular music genre in Argentina in the 1990s. =1990s Metal= The last decade of the twentieth century was a very productive one for this style of rock in Argentina. There had always been \\"heavy\\" bands: Billy Bond y la Pesada del Rock in the 1960s, Pescado Rabioso and Pappo's Blues in the 1970s, V8, Riff (Argentine band), and several underground metal acts in the 1980s. But they had never been at the forefront of Argentine rock, seemingly always obscured by other genres whether it was acoustic, symphonic, progressive, or the 1980s invasion bands. This changed in the 1990s. As the decade started Rata Blanca, Horcas, Herm√©tica and J.A.F had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is plausible to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular to a lesser extent was Herm√©tica, the arch- rivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 1987 when V8 disbanded), but there were no doubts of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure. The major development in Argentine metal of the 1990s was the rise of A.N.I.M.A.L.. The acronym translated literally stands for \\"Abused (accosted), Our Indians Died While Fighting\\". And their themes lived up to that title: the band would be one of the most outspoken advocates for indigenous people and even nationalism, while also (as such bands tend to do), blasting against the current world order. Their sound is equal parts hardcore, heavy metal, and thrash. Another important band formed in 1990 was Tren Loco, whom long after went to Japan and won second place in a major battle-of-the-band event at famous Budokan Stadium in Tokyo. The metal underground also flourished in the 1990s, with bands like Alakr√°n, Jezabel, Jason, Logos, and Jeriko, among others. =Other developments= Solo artists from the earlier generations were by the 1990s established figures in the medium. The biggest two stars (as had been the case since 1970), were Charly Garc√≠a and Luis Alberto Spinetta. Garcia enjoyed a prolific 1980s with many of his albums turning into classics. Spinetta had a more uneven body of work but nonetheless was successful. Pappo continued putting out blues and heavy rock records, Miguel Mateos remained a popular rock figure in Latin America even as he dropped almost off the radar in Argentina. Le√≥n Gieco's unique \\"folk-rock meets world music\\" approaches made him an internationally acclaimed musician. Fito P√°ez, 2003. Fito P√°ez's pop career continued to take-off in the early 1990s. In 1992 he released El Amor despu√©s del Amor, becoming the best selling Argentine rock album. The title \\"love after love\\" was not by chance: he had just ended a well-publicized relationship with female rocker Fabiana Cantilo (herself an important 1990s singer in the movement), and was getting involved with movie actress Cecilia Roth.'El amor despu√©s del Amor' Wikipedia- La Enciclopedia Libre (Spanish) With the album Paez was confirmed an international pop star. Meanwhile, Andr√©s Calamaro had enjoyed some popularity since his solo career begun, but never managed a complete breakthrough with the public. He left for Spain, and there met two local musicians forming Los Rodriguez in 1991. Two years later the hit single \\"Sin Documentos\\" finally gave Calamaro an international hit, and the band gained overnight vogue in Spain and Latin America. Tropical, Fusion, and Latin influenced rock continued its ascent. 1992 was the year of \\"La Pachanga\\": Rosario's Vilma Palma e Vampiros single was an across the board mega hit in the Spanish-speaking world; there was no way of escaping it unless one did not have any kind of social life in the early 1990s. Bands like Los Aut√©nticos Decadentes, who had a major hit in 1990 with \\"Loco (tu forma de ser)\\", and Los Pericos mirrored the tendency of increased popularity for the subgenre. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had a slump in the early 1990s after harvesting great accolades in the late 1980s, but came back with a roar in 1994 with Vasos Vacios; the compilation that featured \\"Matador\\". The single would turn into a global superhit, winning MTV's best video of the year.Biography LFC - Official Website The early 1990s were also the formative years of a group that would have an impact towards the new millennium: Bersuit Vergarabat. La Mosca would begin tapping into the tropical and Latin trend by 1995. Argentine punk-revival took off in the 1990s. Los Violadores had ruled 1980s punk; them along with the foreign punk bands of yesteryear would inspire the members of Attaque 77 and Flema. Formed in 1986 and 1987 respectively, they were pioneers of the worldwide punk revival movement. Attaque 77's breakthrough came in 1990 with the single \\"Hacelo por Mi\\"; Flema never broke to the mainstream but were heroic figures of the punk underground. Both groups paved the way for dozens of followers. One of those were 2 Minutos, with their pure-energy, extreme, back-to-basics punk rock. Another darling of the scene were Todos Tus Muertos, perhaps one of few bands in any punk movement that was accepted for their various rock styles besides punk. Fun People took punk's liberal philosophy to another level by tackling the punk-scene itself: many of their lyrics criticized the macho attitudes in the movement which they saw contradictory to the spirit of punk. They were also the first band that sang in Spanglish, meanwhile another bands, like Drop Dead! Argentina used to do it only in English. The She Devils were the leaders of the local queercore scene. Cienfuegos, a punk band that had existed since the 1980s but suffered various contingencies, finally would produce albums by the mid 1990s. See: Argentine punk In the Argentine northwest, important punk and indie scenes developed in the mid-to-late nineties. Bands like 448, Volstead, Estacion Experimental and Los Chicles led the scenes. = The Mid '90s Schism = In the middle years of the 1990s a rift developed in Argentine rock that would, with only slight wrinkles, endure to present times. By 1995 \\"nuevo rock argentino\\" or Argentine new rock had lost steam. For starters, bands like Los Siete Delfines and Peligrosos Gorriones, with their more artistic antics, fell out of favor. At the same time, groups like Massacre and La Portuaria went on recording hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds in the early to mid-2000s. Los Brujos disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last hurrahs of new rock were rap-rockers Actitud Maria Marta, which had a year of fame in 1995. Babas√≥nicos, Todos Tus Muertos, and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached. Also, 1995 would see the last album by Soda Stereo, their relaxed almost chillout-like Sue√±o Stereo, an album at times more electronic than rock previewing the direction of Gustavo Cerati's solo career. Soda Stereo would go on a last grand tour through the United States and Latin America, selling out entire stadiums as they went.El √∫ltimo sorbo de Soda Stereo (Chile) www.copesa.cl (Spanish) Their last concert in Buenos Aires in 1997 was released as a double-album, with 70,000 people selling out twice at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. The arguably greatest band in Argentine and Rock en Espa√±ol history wrapped up the concert and their career with the live version of \\"De Musica Ligera\\";, Gustavo Cerati, the vocalist, guitarist and leader of the band, would end the song thanking his public, and would finish this gratitude by saying \\"... Gracias totales\\" (total thanks), this would become an iconic phrase for the band and Argentine rock thereafter. Conversely, \\"rolinga\\" rock was on the up. On the one hand were the 1980s bands that by the mid 1990s approached the suburban rock sound: Redonditos de Ricota, Divididos, Las Pelotas. They were joined by two bands that would define suburban in the late 1990s as well: Los Piojos and La Renga. La Renga is also considered one of the Rolinga groups (followers of the Rolling Stones blueprint) like Los Ratones Paranoicos and Viejas Locas, whose weighty followings would only grow larger. Argentine youth began to musically and socially gravitate to either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (rolinga and post-chab√≥n in suburban rock; sonico, punk, dark in the underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were in place for the current period of rock in Argentina. On a completely different, and original level, Andrea Prodan (Luca Prodan's brother) emerged with a bizarre and unique all-vocal, solo album called Viva Voce, recorded on independent label Silly Records. The record won an A.C.E. award and was among Peter Gabriel's favourite records in his Real World list of 1996.  1998‚àí : Modern Argentine Rock  = Late 1990s & 21st century = The late 1990s charts were dominated by the success of bands like Los Piojos, La Renga, Divididos, Redonditos de Ricota, Las Pelotas, Los Ratones Paranoicos, La Mancha de Rolando, Caballeros de la Quema, and many more suburban rock bands. They were joined by Uruguayans No Te Va Gustar and La Vela Puerca, giving rise to the term \\"rioplatense\\" rock (rock from the R√≠o de la Plata region) to label all of the similarly inclined outfits. Rolinga rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the rolinga scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of rolinga rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate. On the other hand, the likes of Divididos, Los Piojos, and Redonditos have transcended its constraints and become influential in Argentine rock and popular on an international level. The better bands in the genre also feature an unusual versatility with non- rock styles like tango, folk, African music, Latin, jazz, and even North American country music, each with their own eclectic mixture. It would help elevate them from the legions of imitators in the crowded suburban scene. Divididos 6th album \\"Narigon Del Siglo\\" (2000) was one of the first great Argentine rock albums of the new decade; it was peppered with folk. The underground was more under than usual in the late 1990s, it was nonetheless extremely creative. A style that gained some mainstream exposure was \\"rock s√≥nico\\" (\\"sonic\\" rock), influenced by the 1980s \\"techno-pop\\" of Virus and early Soda Stereo (and also Britpop), through Babas√≥nicos and Juana La Loca. The latter group found success with sonic rock in 1997's Vida Modelo. The former would increase their popularity with each new album, arriving at 2001's Jessico, which received international acclaim as one of the first truly outstanding albums of the new millennium. Other underground groups started making noise at this time: Iguana Lovers, they founded the Sonic movement in Buenos Aires in 1990,BBC News, Iguana Lovers, Interesting and fresh independent music from South America El Otro Yo, Catupecu Machu, and Santos Inocentes, leaders-to-be of the early 2000s alternative rock scene in Argentina. Super Ratones's returned to the alternative charts with 2001's Grammy nominee Mancha Registrada. In heavy metal, Herm√©tica disbanded by 1995 giving rise to Almafuerte. With a more up-to-date sound, they were one of the late 1990s favorites along with A.N.I.M.A.L.. Rata Blanca continued to perform and record intermittently touring countries around Latin America. Classic metalists O'Connor in the underground would emerge by the early 2000s, along with exponents of nu metal Cabezones and Carajo. One of the most critically acclaimed bands of present is Los Natas. Originally a stoner rock group, in subsequent albums the band has turned more experimental. Some have called this demiurgic style (infused with Argentine folk, psychedelia, and space rock) \\"Patagonian doom\\", and this brand of metal has been ranked with the best heard in the new millennium. The band itself prefers to call it \\"free\\" rock. Bersuit Vergarabat, 2004. In punk, Attaque 77 were still going strong, as did Fun People (including a European tour), until their disbanding in 2000. The punk underground of the late 1990s was buzzing with new bands (Cadena Perpetua, Expulsados), many of them to guide the early 2000s melodic punk scene (Smitten (band), Shaila). In tropical or fusion rock, Bersuit Vergarabat rose to the zenith of the genre. Libertinaje (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up Hijos del Culo (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility. From the side of reggae-rock Los Pericos and Los Cafres dominated. Ska had Los Calzones and Kapanga, but by 2000 Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had called it quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin. La Mosca and Dancing Mood reached achieved greater popularity. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo's separation in 2001.Se Separo Illya Kuryaki ElAcople.com A highly talented and promising band was Karamelo Santo, another contribution of the city of Mendoza (also home of Los Enanitos Verdes). They featured a very refreshing mix of rock, punk, ska, afro-Uruguayan, and cumbia rhythms that earned them critical praise in Argentina. They would spend most of the 2001-2004 period on extensive tours of Europe and the Americas.Karamelo Santo www.rock.com.ar Todos Tus Muertos would break up at the height of their popularity in 1999. To a lesser extent dance and electronica music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also influenced Argentine rock of the 2000s. A good example of this is the internationally prominent techno-pop act Miranda!, a band that owes as much to current dance and electronica as the 1980s techno-pop of Virus and Los Encargados, electronic pioneers in Argentina. = Nowadays = As with any evolving musical movement, it's hard to define the state of the scene in question. Its final anthology will not be written until 10 to 20 years in the future. But in general terms, Argentine rock in the middle of the 2000s decade can be said to showcase the following trends: * A continued commercial success of rolinga and suburban rock. In the early part of the current decade the so- called '2nd wave of suburban' crashed to the scene: Guasones, Jovenes Pordioseros, La 25, Cielo Razzo, Black Roses, Hijos Del Oeste, El Bordo, Callejeros and Casi Justicia Social. Their fan base is somewhat younger than those of the 1st wave, and their music is derivative of the 1st but with a slightly pop, more teen oriented approach. * Influenced by bands like Genesis, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Rush and Dream Theater the underground progressive rock and progressive metal scene has been constantly growing since 2005, with many trends like: metal - influenced bands like Fughu, Dudosa Moral and Destino 101, progressive - pop - metal like De Rien, jazz fusion - progressive rock outfit Fantas√≠a Crom√°tica, progressive - folk Is√≥sceles, King Crimson - Frank Zappa influenced Souls Ignite and symphonic rock-art rock Rodrigo San Mart√≠n and Maybe. * The current punk scene in Argentina features no real mainstream bands (besides eternal punks Attaque 77), and a huge underground scene which has a healthy amount of talent. Bands worth mentioning include Smitten (band); Cadena Perpetua with their well-crafted and tight songs; Romapagana certainly unusual and inspiring with their cosmopolitan mix of language and dinamic sound;Shaila who also features many English lyric songs, unusual for Argentine rock; and veterans 2 Minutos who soldier on. * Heavy Metal at mid decade features a predominance of nu-metal and doom metal groups; Carajo, Cabezones and a recharged A.N.I.M.A.L. in the former (and all having toured extensively overseas), internationally acclaimed doomsters Los Natas, and L√∂rihen for the latter. O'Connor is the most prominent of the classic metal revivalists. Under AC/DC influence, consolidated his career La Naranja Metalica. * In fusion or tropical rock Bersuit Vergarabat still command legions. Dancing Mood is the ska representative on the mainstream, and Nonpalidece is the current reggae-rock band in vogue. Other current bands include Karamelo Santo, Los Calzones, La Mosca Ts√© - Ts√©, and Kapanga. Ex-Los Fabulosos Cadillacs Vicentico and ex-Todos Tus Muertos Fidel Nadal are both well embarked in their solo careers with fusion rock. * In alternative, El Otro Yo continue their impressive streak of great albums and fresh sounding music. Catupecu Machu's slightly threatening rock has made them a mainstream alternative band, and Babas√≥nicos are arguably the most internationally popular Argentine band today. La Portuaria, after a late 1990s hiatus in a hostile musical climate, returned in the early 2000s as alternative once again resurfaced in Argentina. * A renovated indie scene with great bands like Jaime Sin Tierra, which created lush beautiful rock before disbanding in 2001 leaving behind the seed for the sound of bands like Las Curvas de Mondri√°n, 1000 NICKS with their retro rock style, Dalmanerea with their original and creative \\"meZKla argentina\\" and Interama and their left-of-the-dial melodies. Entre Rios's elegant electro lounge with female vocals is one of the best kept secrets in Argentina's indie scene. The indie scene also has a neo-symphonic revival scene with the likes of Pez and A Tirador Laser, bands which are reviving the sound of later 1970s Argentine rock with an updated resonance. * In addition there is a large indie scene influenced by Krautrock and late 1980s/early 1990s British and American indie-rock acts such as The Pastels, The Vaselines, Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine. Some of the most popular bands from this scene include Iguana LoversThe Guardian UK, Best Music Across the Map (that's started in 1990 with collaborations of Ride (band) members, Mark GardenerCiudad espect√°culos, Mark Gardener & Iguana Lovers, Ride, contacto en Buenos Aires and Loz Colbert and the Scottish band The Jesus and Mary ChainTelam, Iguana Lovers presenta Surfing Caos junto a The Jesus and Mary Chain), El Mato a un Policia Motorizado and Banda de Turistas. * The start of the 2nd generation of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati spent most of the early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (Ahi Vamos) where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota Solari's debut album El tesoro de los Inocentes was seen as the best of 2004. Vicentico and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has just released his third solo album, Los P√°jaros. Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts. * Many new bands influenced by Redonditos de Ricota are reaching recognition. Those include Mavirock, and Cajale Cazazo. * The first decade of this century saw the apparition of rock bands singing in English, like Watchmen (not to be confused with The Watchmen, the Canadian band), or the Anglo-Argentine The Draytones. Skiltron, playing Celtic metal, released his first album in 2006. Skiltron split in 2011, giving origin to Triddana. Another Celtic metal is Tersivel (2004), whose first EP was recorded in 2006 and their first full-length album was released in 2010. Other notable English singing bands are Electronomic√≥n (hard rock), Kapel Maister (symphonic metal), 42 decibel42 Decibel - Hard Rock N' Roll (hard rock), , Maxi Trusso, Full Nothing, Siam√©s and Octafonic.

Quality of the asphalt surface is quite good on this side of the crest but there are many curves and rises with limited visual distances. There are no tourist services or other infrastructure on the Saddle Road. Reconstruction of the sections from mileposts 11 to 19 and 19 to 28 was finished in November 2011 and October 2008, respectively. A Hawaiian Lele (altar) near the junction of Saddle Road and Mauna Kea Access Road, Mauna Kea in the background The terrain becomes the high lava desert of the Humuula Saddle. Two roads intersect Saddle Road close to Puu Huluhulu at its crest near mile 28 at above sea level, the Mauna Loa Observatory Road to the south, and the Mauna Kea Summit Road to the north. The Mauna Loa Observatory Road is an unmarked long narrow rough (but paved) road which winds its way towards Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, Mauna Loa Atmospheric Observatory, and AMiBA on the slopes of Mauna Loa. It was connected in 1963 to the old Tom Vance road from 1950. New section of Saddle Road, around mile post 30, Mauna Kea in the background The Mauna Kea Summit Road (known as John A. Burns Way) provides access to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy (at elevation then climbs Mauna Kea past the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve to the height of at grades averaging 17% making this the third highest public road in the United States. The road is long, of which the first 6 miles (to the Onizuka Center) and the last are paved. Puu Wƒìkiu is the highest point in Hawaii at and is home to Poliahu, Goddess of Snow. Mauna Kea Observatory on the summit, an ideal location for astronomical seeing, is under the jurisdiction of the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. Hawaii Route 200 - \\"Daniel K. Inouye Highway\\" Sign Entrance to Bradshaw Field West and northwest of these turnoffs, the segment of Route 200 from milepost 28 to 35 was dedicated and opened to traffic on May 29, 2007, with Senator Daniel K. Inouye as the keynote speaker and other local dignitaries. The new segment is quite a contrast to the roadway near the P≈çhakuloa Training Area. The old section of roadway included some of the more dangerous features of the old Saddle Road: a sharp curve, blind corner and one way bridge near the entrance to Mauna Kea State Recreation Area that was one of the worst on the roadway. In contrast, the new section was constructed to full federal highway standards, with wide shoulders, rumble strips, good signage and emergency phones at regular intervals. From milepost 35 to 44 the road passes the main gates of P≈çhakuloa Training Area and Bradshaw Army Airfield before continuing across the military reservation. Military vehicles ‚Äì including armored personnel carriers ‚Äì occasionally cross or occupy the roadway. Artillery exercises, including live fire, are not uncommon. with batteries set up along the roadway firing towards Mauna Loa. This section of the road was repaved in the summer of 2008, greatly improving the conditions. On August 18, 2009, the completely rebuilt section, from milepost 35 to 42, opened to public travel. The realignment relocated the highway north to the Mauna Kea side of the Army base and Bradshaw Army Airfield. A new section starting near mile marker 42 that bypasses Waikii and connects to MƒÅmalahoa Highway near mile marker 14, opened September 7, 2013. At this time, the highway was officially renamed the Daniel K. Inouye Highway in honor of the late senator from Hawaii. This new section avoids the old route, where from milepost 44, near Kilohana, to the MƒÅmalahoa Highway the road retained its original character, a narrow ribbon of poorly maintained pavement with crumbling edges. On the old section, there are several one-lane bridges, blind curves and hills. It is common for drivers to negotiate the center of the road to avoid the rough shoulders, moving back into the lane only when necessary to pass traffic proceeding in the opposite direction. The route is quite scenic with views of the coastline, the HualƒÅlai and Kohala volcanoes, winding its way across Parker Ranch and through the development of Waikii. The original western terminus of Route 200 comes at its junction with MƒÅmalahoa Highway (state route 190) toward Kona of Waimea (coordinates ). *Total miles = History In May 1849, Minister of Finance Gerrit P. Judd proposed building a road directly between the two population centers of the Island of Hawaii. Using prison labor, it started near Holualoa Bay at and proceeded in a straight line up to the plateau south of HualƒÅlai. After ten years only about were completed, when work was abandoned at when the 1859 eruption of Mauna Loa blocked its path. Although destroyed at lower elevations due to residential development, it can still be seen on maps as the \\"Judd Trail\\". While planning for the defense of the Hawaiian islands in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U. S. Army hastily built an access road in 1943 across the Humuula plateau of Parker Ranch at . Since it was not intended as a civilian road, the simple gravel path was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the US Army Corps of Engineers in case of an invasion. Military vehicles of all types and treads traversed the Island for the next three years. Following the end of World War II in 1945, the Army turned over jurisdiction of the road to the Territory of Hawaii and it was designated \\"State Route 20\\". However, the territorial government had few funds to maintain the road, let alone upgrade it to civilian standards. Much of the paving dates from 1949. About the same time, Tom Vance, who had earlier supervised building a highway up Mauna Loa named for Governor Ingram Stainback, secretly used his prison laborers to start a more direct Hilo-Kona road. He started at a camp (still called \\"Vance\\" on USGS maps) which was exactly midway between Hilo and Kealakekua. The road extended in a straight line, heading for the pass between HualƒÅlai and Mauna Loa. In 1950, the camp caught fire after construction reached . The public refused to allocate more funding when they discovered about US$1 million had already been spent, so the project was also abandoned. After islands became the State of Hawaii in 1959, Saddle Road was handed to the County of Hawaii and for many years only minimal maintenance was performed, leading to generally poor conditions and the source of the road's notorious reputation. Since 1992, there has been increased attention on the road, with efforts to rebuild and renovate the highway into a practical cross-island route. This resulted in repaving some sections and complete rebuilding of others. The entire road is now well paved, and in the uphill sections there is a separate lane for trucks and slower cars. Future Eventual plans are to complete a section past MƒÅmalahoa Highway down to the coast and intersecting the Queen Kaahumanu Highway (state route 19) to support cross-island commuting by tourists and resort employees. The route for the entirely new sections of the highway was changed after the 2006 expansion of the military exercise areas. Completion of these projects represent a major realignment of island traffic patterns and conversion of this notorious roadway into a modern state highway. Major intersections Related route Hawaii Route 2000 is a road on the island of Hawaii, in the state of Hawaii. The road's western terminus is at Hawaii Route 200 (known as the Saddle Road). The eastern terminus is at Hawaii Route 11 (known as the Hawaii Belt Road) in Hilo where the Prince K≈´hi≈ç Plaza shopping center is located. Route 2000 is called P≈´ƒÅinak≈ç Street Extension, East P≈´ƒÅinak≈ç Street, and West P≈´ƒÅinak≈ç Street. The project was planned since 1995.

(computer-generated impression) Soyuz space capsule retro-rockets cushion the landing impact A retrorocket (short for retrograde rocket) is a rocket engine providing thrust opposing the motion of a vehicle, thereby causing it to decelerate. They have mostly been used in spacecraft, with more limited use in short-runway aircraft landing. New uses are emerging since 2010 for retro-thrust rockets in reusable launch systems. History Rockets were fitted to the nose of some models of the DFS 230, a World War II, German Military glider. This enabled the aircraft to land in more confined areas than would otherwise be possible during an airborne assault. Another World War II development was the British Hajile project, initiated by the British Admiralty's Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. Originally a request from the British Army as a method to drop heavy equipment or vehicles from aircraft flying at high speeds and altitudes, the project turned out to be a huge disaster and was largely forgotten after the war. Although some of the tests turned out to be successful, Hajile was too unpredictable to be used in conventional warfare, and by the time the war drew to a close, with no chance to put the project into action, it was shelved. Later Soviet experiments used this technique, braking large air-dropped cargos after a parachute descent. Uses =Deorbit maneuvers= When a spacecraft in orbit is slowed sufficiently, its altitude decreases to the point at which aerodynamic forces begin to rapidly slow the motion of the vehicle, and it returns to the ground. Without retrorockets, spacecraft would remain in orbit for years until their orbits naturally slow, and reenter the atmosphere at a much later date; in the case of manned flights, long after life support systems have been expended. Therefore, it is critical that spacecraft have extremely reliable retrorockets. Project Mercury Due to the high reliability demanded by retrorockets, Mercury spacecraft used a trio of solid fuel, 1000 lbf (4.5 kN) thrust retrorockets that fired for 10 seconds each, strapped to the heat shield on the bottom of the spacecraft. One was sufficient to return the spacecraft to Earth if the other two failed. Project Gemini Gemini used four rockets, each , burning for 5.5 seconds in sequence, with a slight overlap. These were mounted in the retrograde section of the adapter module, located just behind the capsule's heat shield. Apollo program For lunar flights, the Apollo command and service module did not require retrorockets to return the command module to Earth, as the flight path took the module through the atmosphere, using atmospheric drag to reduce velocity. The test flights in Earth orbit required retrograde propulsion, which was provided by the large Service Propulsion Engine on the service module. The same engine was used as a retrorocket to slow the spacecraft for lunar orbit insertion. The Apollo Lunar Module used its descent stage engine to drop from orbit and land on the Moon. Retrorockets were used to back the S-IC and S-II stages off from the rest of the vehicle after their respective shutdowns during the Saturn V's launch to Earth parking orbit. Space Shuttle program The Space Shuttle Orbital maneuvering system provided the vehicle with a pair of powerful liquid-fueled rockets for both reentry and orbital maneuvering. One was sufficient for a successful reentry, and if both systems were to fail, the reaction control system could slow the vehicle enough for reentry. =Launch vehicle staging= To ensure clean separation and prevent contact, multistage rockets such as the Titan II, Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V may have small retrorockets on lower stages, which ignite upon stage separation. Meanwhile, the succeeding stage may have ullage rockets, both to aid separation and ensure good starting of liquid-fuel engines. =Landers= Retrorockets are also used in landing spacecraft on other astronomical bodies, such as the Moon and Mars, as well as enabling a spacecraft to enter an orbit around such a body, when otherwise it would scoot past and off into space again. As pointed out above (in connection with Project Apollo) the main rocket on a spacecraft can be re-oriented to serve as a retrorocket. The Soyuz capsule uses small rockets for the last phase of landing. =Reusable launch systems= New uses for retro-thrust rockets emerged since 2010 for reusable launch systems. After second stage separation, the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets uses one to three of the main engines in order to decelerate for propulsive landing. The first stage is then recovered, refurbished and prepared for the next flight. The boosters of other orbital rockets are routinely destroyed after a single use by atmospheric reentry and high-speed impact in the ocean. Companies like Blue Origin with their New Glenn, Link Space with their New Line 1 and national projects like the European Commission's RETALT project and the China National Space Administration's Long March 8 are also pursuing retro-thrust re-entry for reusable boosters. New Shepard is a reusable single-stage suborbital rocket where the booster uses its main engine to land again after a flight. The capsule slows its descent with parachutes and uses retrorockets to slow down just before reaching the ground. =Operation Credible Sport= Operation Credible Sport, a plan put forward by the US government in 1979 to rescue the hostages in Iran resulted in the construction of two modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules, designated YMC-130H, which featured retro-rockets to allow it to perform extremely short landings. As part of the plan, these aircraft would land in the Shahid Shiroudi Stadium near the US Embassy in Tehran and use the retrorockets to come to a stop. One aircraft was destroyed in a crash during a test flight without any fatalities, and the plan was scrapped later that year.

It was a long mule-and-gravity powered line that connected the Midlothian coal mines with wharves that were located at the head of navigation on the James River just below the Fall Line at Manchester (on the south bank directly across from Richmond). It began operating in 1831 as Virginia's first common carrier railroad. Although it was dismantled before the American Civil War after being supplanted by the steam-powered Richmond and Danville Railroad, several portions of the embankments for the roadbed are extant in Chesterfield County near present-day Midlothian Turnpike. History Coal mining in the Midlothian area of Chesterfield County began in the 18th century. Around 1701, French Huguenot settlers to the area discovered the existence of the coalfield. The coalfield was part of the Richmond Basin which is one of the Eastern North America Rift Basins which contains some sedimentary rock and bituminous coal. In a 1709 diary entry William Byrd II, who is credited as the founder of Richmond, and had purchased of land in the area where coal was found, noted that \\"the coaler found the coal mine very good and sufficient to furnish several generations.\\" It was first commercially mined in the 1730s, and was used to make cannon at Westham (near the present Huguenot Memorial Bridge) during the American Revolutionary War. In 1804, the Manchester and Falling Creek Turnpike was built to ease traffic on what is now Old Buckingham Road. In 1807, became the first graveled roadway of any length in Virginia. However, by 1824, Midlothian area coal mine owners were frustrated by the difficulty of transporting on the toll road, now known as Midlothian Turnpike, more than 1,000,000 bushels of coal by wagons and horse teams to waiting ships below the falls at Manchester on the banks of the James River. Seeking a better method of transportation so that their markets could be expanded, in 1825, a group of mine owners, including Nicholas Mills, Beverly Randolph and Abraham S. Wooldridge, resolved to build a tramway. The Wooldridge family hailed from East Lothian and West Lothian in Scotland, and named their mining company Mid-Lothian, the source of the modern name. =Planning and construction 1827-1831= In the winter of 1827, Claudius Crozet, Virginia's State Engineer, surveyed the proposed route and deemed it feasible for construction. This feasibility study was necessary to obtain funding assistance from the Virginia Board of Public Works, a state agency which, beginning in 1816, invested in a portion of the stock of privately managed companies building canals, turnpikes, and, later, railroads. In February 1828, the Chesterfield Railroad Company obtained its charter from the Virginia General Assembly. Within a year, $100,000 stock was subscribed, half purchased by the colliers of Chesterfield County and half by Richmond-area investors. The company hired Moncure Robinson, (1802-1891) a European-trained engineer and U.S. railroad pioneer to supervise construction. In 1830, capital stock was increased to $150,000 to cover unexpectedly high construction expenses. By June 1831, the construction was completed at $127,000 total cost. =Most profitable railroad in the world 1831-1850= By September, 1831, the railroad was operational, using horses, mules and gravity as motive power. One hundred and sixty cars were put into operation, and it was an instant financial success. In 1836, the Chesterfield Railroad Company reported carrying 25,903 cars, 84,976 tons (77,089 tonnes) of coal. It received gross revenues of $83,409. This equaled 19% of stockholders' original investment repaid plus 6% dividend. It was reputed to be the most profitable railroad in the world at the time. In 1840, one of the mining companies reported that 300,000 bushels of coal were extracted from the -deep Pump Shaft alone, one of the more active mines, using the labor of approximately 150 men and 25 mules. It is believed that most of this coal was shipped out by the Chesterfield Railroad. By 1844, the Chesterfield Railroad had repaid the stockholders' entire original investment and consequently came under regulation of Virginia Board of Public Works, which adjusted charges to fix a dividend return of 6%. The rate for carrying coal reduced from 6¬¢ per bushel to 3¬¢. =Outmoded by steam railroad competition 1850-1851= While the Chesterfield Railroad was founded to move coal to Richmond 13 miles (21 km) to the East, the Richmond and Danville railroad replaced it in the 1850s. In 1850, the new steam-driven Richmond and Danville Railroad began operation to Coalfield Station (later renamed Midlothian). Although unsuccessful lawsuits followed, the Chesterfield Railroad was quickly supplanted by the competition. It filed its last report with the Virginia Board of Public Works in 1851. With permission from the state legislature, the Chesterfield Railroad was dismantled before the American Civil War. Design features Operating its entire lifetime without any locomotives, Chesterfield Railroads moved its railcars loaded with coal mostly by gravity downhill to the docks on the James River at the southern edge of Manchester. In places where the line ran uphill, mules helped the cars climb some slopes. The empty cars were hauled back uphill by the mules to the mine, to be reloaded again. In one area the weight of the loaded cars and their downhill motion pulled the empty cars (connected to the full ones by ropes and drums) back toward the mines. One of the most remarkable features was a cycloidal inclined plane, a drum and rope device by which loaded coal- carrying cars lowered down the steep western slope of Falling Creek Valley pulled by two empty cars traveling up the slope. On the eastern side, the loaded cars were then raised over a distance, with power supplied by animals. After completing that movement, the roadbed was mostly a gradual downhill slope over relatively level terrain towards Manchester. Revenues *1843: $37,104.43 for 11,496 cars (822,200 bushels) *1847: $37,329.55 for 20,694 cars (1,552,050 bushels) *1849: $39,591.95 for 17,723 cars of coal (1,329,225 bushels) Presidents * Nicholas Mills * George Fisher (1843) Heritage & remnants The Chesterfield Railroad is commemorated by two Virginia Historical Markers and an exhibit in the Chesterfield Museum.

In principal it operates like a see-saw, with the balance point located closer to the counterweight, which allows the end of the arm with the camera to move through an extended arc. Typically a jib permits the camera to be moved vertically, horizontally, or a combination of the two. A small jib can be mounted on a tripod, but many larger, purpose-built jibs have their own support stands, often on wheels.Scott Schaefermeyer Digital Video Basics 1418865133 2012 p109 \\"A jib arm is basically a small crane that holds nothing but the camera. Large jib arms require somebody to move and control the jib while the camera operator controls the camera. \\" Modern jibs are normally modular and can be assembled in various lengths.  Use  A jib can be used for getting high or low shots which are difficult for a hand-held camera operator to get, or shots which need to move a short distance horizontally or vertically, without the expense and safety issues of putting a camera operator on a crane for a crane shot or laying track for a camera dolly. A jib can even be mounted on a dolly for shots in which the camera moves over obstacles such as furniture, when a normal dolly shot could not be used.  Operation  A jib is more complicated than a simple lever, since almost always the camera's aim needs to be controlled independently of the swing of the jib arm. This can be done either by relatively simple mechanical means or by the use of remotely controlled electric servo motors as used in a remote head. Since the camera operator is usually not able to use the camera's controls directly or look through the camera's viewfinder, a jib is often used in conjunction with a remote control systems for focus, and/or zoom and/or camera function and with a portable video monitor mounted near the jib operator. A device known as a \\"hot head\\" or \\"remote head\\" is attached to the camera end of larger jibs. It supports the camera and enables remote pan/tilt functions with focus/zoom control. This setup can be operated by one person, or the circumstance may require two operators. In a two-operator situation, one person operates the jib arm/boom while another operates the pan/tilt/zoom functions of the remote head.

As of April 2007, the retail price of original GBA Video Paks was lowered to US$9.95. Copy protection Game Boy Advance Video Paks are viewable only on Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Micro, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo DS Lite systems, as the owners of copyright in the television shows requested that Majesco prevent people from using the GameCube's Game Boy Player accessory to play and record the shows onto VHS tapes or DVDs. However, the low resolution and mono sound would result in a low-quality video output on a TV regardless. Unlike Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox video game consoles, the Nintendo GameCube cannot output Macrovision gain-control copy distortion signals. The GBA Video Paks perform a check when inserted into the Game Boy Player, using the same logo authentication method used by Game Boy Advance games that support controller rumble, and will freeze with the message \\"Not compatible with Game Boy Player\\" if they detect the Game Boy Player in use. Disadvantages Because of the low capacity of Game Boy Advance cartridges (normally ranging from 4 to 32 MB, though the video cartridges can reach sizes of 64 MB) and the length of the video content (generally feature-length movies and episodes), GBA Video Paks are heavily compressed, with visual artifacts marring nearly every frame. The image quality has a similar appearance to early Cinepak compression, and the \\"quilting\\" and color bleeding effect found in other compressed video formats is also present. Also, in cases where certain videos are available both as a 45-minute two-part episodes or a 22-minute edited version, the 22-minute version is used. The proprietary codec created by DC Studios is described in detail in the Majesco patents. Additional information Game Boy Advance Video Paks were the feature prize in Vol. 183 of Nintendo Power Magazine, as part of its players poll sweepstakes, in which five grand prize winners would receive a Game Boy Advance SP and twenty GBA Video Paks. Most GBA Video Paks cost US$9.95 and feature 40 to 45 minutes of video content. GBA Video Movie Paks cost US$19.99 and feature up to a 90-minute movie. Some GBA Video Movie Paks came packaged with headphones.

Life Retzius was born in Stockholm, son of the anatomist Anders Retzius (and grandson of the naturalist and chemist Anders Jahan Retzius). He enrolled at Uppsala University in 1860, and received his medicine kandidat degree there in 1866, transferred to the Karolinska Institute, where he became medicine licentiat in 1869 and completed his doctorate in medicine (PhD) in 1871 at Lund University. He received an extraordinary professorship in histology at the Karolinska Institute in 1877 and an ordinary professorship in anatomy there in 1889 (acting from 1888), but resigned in 1890 after conflicts with other members of the institute. As he was married to the feminist Anna Hierta, daughter of the founder of the newspaper Aftonbladet Lars Johan Hierta, his personal wealth allowed him to pursue his research and writing without any stable employment. Moreover, Retzius served as the editor of the Aftonbladet (1884‚Äì87) and was also a journalist there.  Journeys to Egypt and North America  Gustaf Retzius was traveling twice outside of Europe, both times together with his wife Anna. During these trips he was keen to buy ethnographic and archaeological collections for a planned ethnographic museum in Stockholm. = Egypt 1889-1890 = In the winter of 1889-1890, they visited Egypt. Gustaf published articles from the trip in Aftonbladet, which later came to be published as a book Skizzer och uppsatser: Bilder fr√•n Nilens land (Sketches and essays: Pictures from the Nile country). For two weeks departing from Cairo on Christmas Day, they traveled on the Nile. They first traveled up the river to the city of Aswan. There Gustaf purchased collections in the bazaars. Soon the sellers realized that Gustaf was a customer who could pay and they came to the boat and offered their goods and items directly from the beach. Gustaf was looking for skulls for his anthropological studies and managed to acquire 30 \\"mummies\\" during an excursion from Aswan to some rock graves across the Nile where a \\"caretaker\\" on site sold the skulls to Gustaf.Uddenberg (2019), p. 298. Through some English officers he also managed to acquire six skulls from the Battle of Toski. On the way back down the Nile, they visited both Karnak and Luxor. In Luxor, he managed to buy a total of 125 skulls with the help of consul Ahmed Effendi Moustapha Ayy√¢d who sent out a person to dig up graves and bring the skulls.Uddenberg (2019), p. 301. Once back in Cairo, Gustaf had the opportunity to meet the famous Henry Morton Stanley, who just performed his failed expedition to liberate Emin Pascha.Uddenberg (2019), p. 303. In Cairo, Gustaf made further purchases of collections. Large parts of Retzius's collections are available at Medelhavsmuseet in Stockholm and at the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm. = North America 1893 = Objects from British Columbia at the Museum of Ethnography, Stockholm, collected by Gustaf Retzius 1893. During six months beginning in June 1893, the Retzius couple traveled in North America. Just as during the trip to Egypt, an important goal was to buy collections for the future ethnographic museum, as well as to visit colleagues and their institutions. Also during this trip, Gustaf reported in articles in Aftonbladet under the heading \\"Pictures from North America\\". However, there was never a book. The first visit was to Yale and the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh who was followed by several other university visits.Uddenberg (2019), p. 310. They visited the World's exhibition in Chicago where they, among other things, saw ethnographic exhibitions and also several different indigenous people who performed and danced. Here they met the Danish Adrian Jacobsen and the famous Franz Boas. After the world exhibition, they visited several different places and cities, including Santa Fe. They get this opportunity to visit an \\"Indian settlement\\" outside the city. In Santa Fe there was an antique shop called \\"Jake Gold's Free Museum\\" (Gold's Old Curiosity Shop) where Gustaf bought ethnography. For a few weeks, they visited the northwest coast and British Columbia. They came to the city of Victoria, where there were several traders for ethnography, and then traveled on the Vancouver Island. In Bella Bella, they met Adrian Jacobsen's brother Filip Jacobsen who made it possible for Anna and Gustaf to visit several different places during a 12-day trip and also to purchase ethnographic collections.Uddenberg (2019), p. 326. A large part of the objects in the stores in Victoria had been collected by the Jacobsen brothers. Gustaf and Anna were dismayed at the methods used by the dealers to trick the indigenous people to relinquish older items that were not for sale. They were also critical of the missionaries in the area. Gustaf did not get as many skulls during this trip in comparison to the Egyptian journey, but he managed to acquire four so-called \\"longhead\\" skulls.Uddenberg (2019), p. 332. The trip home to Sweden went via stops in several cities, including Chicago again, Baltimore and Washington. Large parts of the collections Retzius acquired during his journey can be found at the Ethnographic Museum. Research Gustaf Retzius published more than 300 scientific works in anatomy, embryology, eugenics, craniometry, zoology and botany. He gave his name to the 60 micrometer-diameter Retzius cells in the central nervous system of the leech (Hirudo medicinalis). During his time at the Karolinska Institute, he made important contributions to anatomical descriptions of the muscles of the eardrum, the bones of the middle ear, and the Eustachian tube. His 1896 2-volume work Das Menschenhirn (The Human Brain) was perhaps the most important treatise written on the gross anatomy of the human brain during the 19th century. He also studied ancient Swedish and Finnish skulls, following the steps of his father Anders Retzius, who had studied the crania of different human \\"races\\" and made pseudoscientific contributions to phrenology. Retzius was one of the fathers of the pseudoscientific race theory, \\"scientific racism\\", trying to glorify the \\"Nordic race\\" as the highest race of mankind. Swedish Academy Gustaf Retzius was politically and socially active. Together with his wife he founded the Hierta-Retzius foundation, which is now administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which Retzius was a member of from 1879. The foundation has two funds, one for the promotion of biological research and the other for supporting projects of an important scientific or social nature. In 1901 Gustaf Retzius became a member of the Swedish Academy, following Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld's demise. He was also a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. As a result, he took part in the awarding of the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry and Literature for years. However, his resignation from his chair in anatomy in 1890 meant that he could not participate directly in the choice of the Physiology or Medicine awardee; although he was an active nominator for that prize from 1901 to 1906, always including Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal. In addition, he could not send nominations for the other prizes. During the decision process of the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Retzius ardently stood up for a sole awarding to Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, thus excluding Camilo Golgi. This was the same view held by in his report for the Nobel Committee. On the contrary, the evaluation by Carl Sundberg favoured Golgi over Cajal. Before the final decision, the written opinion of , who shared Holmgren's views was also taken into account. In the end, Cajal and Golgi were jointly awarded, being the first time this Prize was shared between two laureates. Retzius himself was also a Nobel Prize nominee himself 23 times, in 11 different years from 1901 to 1916. Curiously, he was nominated by Cajal before 1906 and by Golgi after that year. Death He died in 1919 in Stockholm. He was survived by his wife. His seat at the Swedish Academy was taken by Adolf Noreen that same year.

These perceived qualities include endurance, courage, ingenuity, good humour, larrikinism, and mateship. According to this concept, the soldiers are perceived to have been innocent and fit, stoical and laconic, irreverent in the face of authority, naturally egalitarian and disdainful of British class differences.Robert Manne, The war myth that made us, The Age, 25 April 2007 The Anzac spirit also tends to capture the idea of an Australian and New Zealand \\"national character\\", with the Gallipoli Campaign sometimes described as the moment of birth of the nationhood both of Australia and of New Zealand.Andrew Leach, The Myth of the Nation Why is Anzac Day so special? NZ History On Line It was first expressed in the reporting of the landing at Anzac Cove by Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett; as well as later on and much more extensively by Charles Bean. It is regarded as an Australian legend, although its critics refer to it as the Anzac myth.Tony Smith, Conscripting the Anzac myth to silence dissent, Australian Review of Public Affairs, 11 September 2006. Ben Knight, Breaking through our Gallipoli 'myth', ABC news, 2 November 2008 Matt McDonald, 'Lest We Forget': Invoking the Anzac myth and the memory of sacrifice in Australian military intervention, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association's 50th Annual Convention \\"Exploring the Past, Anticipating the Future\\", New York Marriott Marquis, New York City, NY, USA, 15 February 2009. Graham Seal, Inventing Anzac: The Digger and National Mythology, St Lucia: API Network and UQP, 2004. Historical development of the concept The British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett provided the first reports of the landing at Anzac Cove by the newly formed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). His report was published in Australia on 8 May 1915: > They waited neither for orders nor for the boats to reach the beach, but, > springing out into the sea, they waded ashore, and, forming some sort of > rough line, rushed straight on the flashes of the enemy's rifles. Ashmead-Bartlett's account of the soldiers was unashamedly heroic: > There has been no finer feat in this war than this sudden landing in the > dark and the storming of the heights... General Birdwood told the writer > that he couldn't sufficiently praise the courage, endurance and the > soldierly qualities of the Colonials (The Australians) were happy because > they had been tried for the first time and not found wanting. Also in 1915, in response to the reporting of the efforts of the Australian troops, the Australian poet Banjo Paterson wrote \\"We're All Australians Now\\", including the verse: > The mettle that a race can show Is proved with shot and steel, And now we > know what nations know And feel what nations feel. The Anzac spirit was particularly popularised by Charles Bean, Australia's official war historian. For the soldiers at Battle of Gallipoli, Bean argued, life would not have been worth living if they had betrayed the ideal of mateship. Despite the loss at Gallipoli, Australian and New Zealand soldiers were seen to have displayed great courage, endurance, initiative and discipline. The stereotype developed that the Anzac rejected unnecessary restrictions, possessed a sardonic sense of humour, was contemptuous of danger, and proved himself the equal of anyone on the battlefield. Bean encapsulated the meaning of Anzac in his publication Anzac to Amiens: > Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valor in a good cause, for > enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will > never own defeat.National Library of Australia, \\"Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean\\" 1958 saw the publication of Russel Ward's The Australian Legend. Promoting the egalitarianism of the Australian bush and its permutation into the Anzac soldiers as the Australian Legend, it soon became a landmark book in Australian historical writing.John Arnold, \\"Australian History in Print: a bibliographical survey of influential twentieth-century texts\\" , National Inquiry into School History, Government of Australia During the 1960s and 1970s, due to lack of observance of Anzac Day in general society, the idea of a unique Anzac spirit began to fade. Especially among baby boomers, interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point in the aftermath of the anti-war demonstrations over Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. A resurgence in popular commemoration of Anzac Day in the 1980s (possibly linked to the release of the film Gallipoli) brought the idea of an Anzac spirit back into prominence in Australian political discourse. There has been an increase in people, especially youth, attending Anzac Day Dawn Services in Australia and New Zealand,Anne-Marie Hede and John Hall, \\"Anzac Day and Australian nationalism: assessing the marketing lifecycle of this cultural phenomenon\\", Deakin University: www.deakin.edu.au/research/stories/hede/anzac-vietnam.doc where the Anzac spirit is often invoked.\\"Thousands mark Anzac Day at Gallipoli\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 25 April 2007 National identity Coming just fourteen years after the Federation of Australia, the Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians. As such, it has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity. According to history professor Dr Frank Bongiorno: > The Gallipoli campaign was the beginning of true Australian nationhood. When > Australia went to war in 1914, many white Australians believed that their > Commonwealth had no history, that it was not yet a true nation, that its > most glorious days still lay ahead of it. In this sense the Gallipoli > campaign was a defining moment for Australia as a new nation.\\"ANZAC Day\\", > Australian Government Culture and Recreation Portal Anzac Day at Manly, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (1922) Ernest Scott's influential A Short History of Australia, which remained a standard school text for nearly four decades from 1916 and went through six editions in its author's lifetime, clearly enunciated this concept. In the preface to the book's first edition, Scott linked the European settlement of Australia with the idea of Australia becoming a nation on the battlefields of Gallipoli: > This Short History of Australia begins with a blank space on the map and > ends with the record of a new name on the map, that of Anzac. Charles Bean also propagated this view, extending the notion to suggest that New Zealand nationhood was also born in the First World War. In 1924 Bean wrote that: > Anzac Day now belongs to the past and during the war all energy was > concentrated on the future but the influence of the Gallipoli Campaign upon > the national life of Australia and New Zealand has been far too deep to > fade‚Ä¶ it was on the 25th of April 1915 that the consciousness of nationhood > was born. The popular belief that the Anzacs, through their spirit, forged Australia's national character, is still today frequently expressed. For example, in 2006 the Governor-General of Australia, Michael Jeffery gave an address in which he said that although the Anzacs lost the campaign they created a lasting identity for Australia: > We are summoned to recall the battle sacrifices of Australian farmers and > tally clerks, teachers and labourers and to commemorate outstanding courage > and strength of character in the face of sustained adversity... [The > campaign] won for us an enduring sense of national identity based on those > iconic traits of mateship, courage, compassion and nous. An extension of this belief is the idea that the Anzacs set an example for future generations of Australians to follow, laying the bedrock of \\"Australian values\\". In 2007 the Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson articulated this view, stating that the Anzacs \\"forged values that are ours and make us who we are, reminding us that there are some truths by which we live.\\" Nelson had earlier argued that the story of Simpson and his donkey rescuing wounded men at Gallipoli \\"represents everything that's at the heart of what it means to be an Australian\\".'Teach Australian values or \\"clear off\\", says Nelson', PM, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 24 August 2005. The Anzac spirit is also sometimes said to be exhibited during Australian civilian crises. For example, the Returned and Services League of Australia states: > The Spirit of the ANZAC continues today in times of hardship such as > cyclones, floods and bush fires. At those times Australians come together to > rescue one another, to ease suffering, to provide food and shelter, to look > after one another, and to let the victims of these disasters know they are > not alone. In New Zealand, the Anzac spirit is similarly pointed to in some quarters as forming an important component of New Zealand national identity. The New Zealand Government's Ministry of Culture and Heritage states: > New Zealand soldiers distinguished themselves with their courage and skill, > establishing an enduring bond with the Australians they fought alongside ... > Great suffering was caused to a small country by the loss of so many of its > young men. But the Gallipoli campaign showcased attitudes and attributes - > bravery, tenacity, practicality, ingenuity, loyalty to King and comrades - > that helped New Zealand define itself as a nation, even as it fought > unquestioningly on the other side of the world in the name of the British > Empire. After Gallipoli, New Zealand had a greater confidence in its > distinct identity, and a greater pride in the international contribution it > could make. And the mutual respect earned during the fighting formed the > basis of the close ties with Australia that continue today.Government of New > Zealand, Anzac Day Criticism Professor Manning Clark, in his influential work A History of Australia, suggested a contrasting image of the innocent and honourable Anzac soldier. From a range of sources he provided evidence of the soldiers' bad behaviour. For example, he documented that, as recruits, some indulged in sex orgies with an 18-year-old girl at the Broadmeadows camp before being shipped to war. Others confronted police in violent scuffles on the streets of Melbourne. Clark also recorded that in Egypt some soldiers burned the belongings of local people, brawled, got drunk and rioted, and spent sufficient time in the local brothels for many of them to contract venereal disease. Other scholars such as professor of politics at La Trobe University, Robert Manne, have also questioned the veracity of the Anzac legend, arguing that it is more accurate to describe the concept as a mythology. Dr Dale Blair of Deakin University suggests that: > While traits such as egalitarianism, resourcefulness and initiative are > assumed and maintained in the nation's popular memory as a truthful > representation, not only of Australia's First World War soldiers, but also, > of the national character, they were not sufficiently evident in the > experience of the 1st Battalion [at Gallipoli] to justify their advancement > as characteristics general to Australian soldiers or the nation.Peter Edgar, > \\"Review of Dinkum Diggers: an Australian battalion at war\\" by Dale Blair , > Australian War Memorial Journal According to Blair, the official war historian Charles Bean \\"advanced an idealised view of sacrifice to provide the nation with higher meaning and comfort as compensation for the death of its soldiers\\". Bean wrote in his diary that the \\"rule of censorship forbids criticism\\", and that the war correspondent should avoid \\"needlessly distressing their families at home\\". Professor Verity Burgmann of the University of Melbourne argues that the prevailing picture of Anzac and later battles on the Western Front as the highest representation of national unity and shared sacrifice is a misrepresentation, because two conscription referenda were defeated in Australia, and many Australians were totally opposed to any participation in the war.Shane Cahill \\"Don't mention the anti-war feeling\\" , The University of Melbourne Voice, Vol. 3, No. 1, 14 April - 12 May 2008 Conflicting reports on the factual events of the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, continue to surface with conflicting eye-witness reporting.B-General Aspinall-Oglander Other skeptics have questioned the idea that Australia's \\"national character\\" was forged on the beaches of Gallipoli. In 2008 an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: > But why should Australians now, 90 years later, be still so eager for some > stereotypical reaffirmation of their character? Why the self-doubt? The > danger in the transformation - as remembrance replaces memory, and > nationalism replaces remembrance - is that the solemnity and the serious > purpose of Anzac Day will be lost in an irrelevant search for some kind of > essence of Australianness. Similarly, historian Mark McKenna disputes the notion that the character traits that supposedly define the Anzac spirit are uniquely and demonstrably Australian, arguing that these virtues are in fact universal, being \\"found in Palestine and Iraq, in Darfur and East Timor, in Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.\\"Mark McKenna, Patriot Act , The Australian, 6 June 2007. Accessed 16 June 2007. Alan Young, a World War II veteran and film maker, presents a different view of the origins of the Anzac tradition in his film Forging the Anzac Tradition, The Untold Story. Young argues that \\"If Gallipoli is the birthplace of the Anzac acronym, then the Western Front is where the Anzac legend grew up, stood tall and cemented their place in international history; and in our hearts\\". He points out that five times the number of men died in the \\"real war\\" at the Western Front than at the disastrous Gallipoli diversion, yet many Australians know very little of this sacrifice. Some have also critiqued the masculine underpinnings of the Anzac legend. According to popular notions of the Anzac spirit, the male bonding or mateship becomes the main characteristic in the description of Australianess, yet these characteristics are seen to imply that the true Australian is inevitably and only male.\\"National Identity\\" Australian Studies Centre, Petra Christian University Some feminists have therefore described this notion as being exclusionary and discriminatory, and contend that, as a result, it cannot possibly define what it means to be Australian.ABC Radio National/Open Learning, \\"The Good Citizen.\\" Program Two: Imagining Australia , Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1998.Patricia Grimshaw, Marilyn Lake, Ann McGrath and Marian Quartly, Creating a Nation, McPhee/Gribble/Penguin, 1994, (reprinted 1996, 2000). Professor Joy Damousi has questioned a view of an Australian national character which relies exclusively on militarism and heroism, arguing that this obscures a more complex, diverse and inclusive understanding of identity.\\"Gallipoli ‚Äì remembering and learning\\" , The University of Melbourne Voice Vol. 3, No. 1, 14 April - 12 May 2008 More broadly, Dr Martin Ball of the University of Melbourne argues that conflating the Anzac spirit with a collective Australian national character exposes an uncritically narrow understanding of Australian history: > The Anzac tradition holds many values for us all to celebrate, but the myth > also suppresses parts of Australian history that are difficult to deal with. > Anzac is a means of forgetting the origins of Australia.

(There were also many minor houses.) At roughly the same time shogi was organised into three houses. Here \\"house\\" implies institution run on the recognised lines of the iemoto system common in all Japanese traditional arts. In particular the house head had, in three of the four cases, a name handed down: Inoue Inseki, Yasui Senkaku, Hayashi Monnyu. References to these names therefore mean to the contemporary head of house. The four houses were the Honinbo, Hayashi, Inoue and Yasui. They were originally designed to be on a par with each other, and competed in the official castle games called oshirogo. The houses =Hon'inb≈ç= The Hon'inb≈ç house was easily the strongest school of Go for most of its existence. It was established in 1612 and survived until 1940. Upon the closure of the school, the title Hon'inb≈ç came to be used for the winner of the Honinbo Tournament, which is now an annual professional go event in Japan. It is run under the titleholder system, meaning that at any given time there is a player who can use the title Hon'inb≈ç. It is customary for Japanese players to take a special personal name as Hon'inb≈ç, a unique feature of this title; for example Takagawa Kaku held the title for nine years, and during this time was referred to as Hon'inb≈ç Shukaku. Players of other nationalities by custom do not adopt a special name, but do use the Hon'inb≈ç title. Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´sai sold his title to the Japan Go Association before retiring in 1936, effectively ending the Hon'inb≈ç line.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/12/03/books/book- reviews/exploration-game-heart-master-go/#.WzoxDNVKjIU All three of the \\"go saints\\" (or Kisei) came from this school‚Äî Dosaku, Shusaku and Jowa (although Jowa is frequently reviled because of his machinations while trying to become Meijin). Most of the holders of the Meijin title (awarded to a player recognised by all as strongest) were also from this house. Another prominent member was Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´saku (ÁßÄÁ≠ñ, 1829‚Äì1862), who was heir to become head of the school, but died of cholera before officially becoming Hon'inb≈ç. The Nihon Ki-in decided to name players who had won the Hon'inb≈ç tournament 5 times or more in a row (making them Honorary Hon'inb≈ç) would be given the Hon'inb≈ç prefix after Cho Chikun won the title 10 times in a row. This meant that Takagawa Kaku (9 in a row), Sakata Eio (7), Ishida Yoshio (5), and Cho Chikun (10) may be addressed as 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th Hon'inb≈ç respectively whether or not they are currently holding the Hon'inb≈ç title. Honorary Hon'inb≈çs *22nd Hon'inb≈ç Takagawa Kaku *23rd Hon'inb≈ç Sakata Eio *24th Hon'inb≈ç Ishida Yoshio *25th Hon'inb≈ç Cho Chikun *26th Hon'inb≈ç Iyama Yuta =Hayashi= The Hayashi house was one of the four go houses of Edo period Japan. It was in effect the junior partner in the system of go schools, never providing a Meijin player. Always an ally of the Honinbo school, for traditional reasons, it didn't survive to the end of the period as truly independent. Its headship went to Honinbo Shuei, and when he became also Honinbo head, it was de facto merged into the Honinbos. From the second head onwards, the head of house when playing was known as Hayashi Monny≈´. =Inoue= The Inoue house was one of the four go houses, the state-supported schools for the game of go in Japan during the Edo period. The numbering of the heads of the house is that introduced by Inoue Genan Inseki, at the start of the nineteenth century, and including Nakamura Doseki for reasons of prestige. During their playing careers all the heads, apart from Doseki, were called Inoue Inseki. For reasons of convenience the retirement or posthumous names are used, in the style Inoue Genkaku Inseki with the personal part of the name interposed. Variant names abound. =Yasui= The Yasui house (ÂÆâ‰∫ïÂÆ∂) was one of the four Schools (or Houses) of Go which were officially recognized during the Edo period of Japanese history. Each of the four schools were founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1612.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric et al. (2005). \\"Go\\" in ; n.b., Louis-Fr√©d√©ric is pseudonym of Louis-Fr√©d√©ric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File . The house had one Meijin, in Yasui Sanchi. It has been commented that the general style of play tended to the pragmatic, rather than the artistic way. From 1737 to the present, the current head of the Yasui house has been known as Senkaku. The retirement or posthumous names are listed here. History This maki-e Go board is at the temple named Ry≈çgen'in ÈæçÊ∫êÈô¢ at Daitoku-ji, Kyoto, Japan. It was said to be used by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. The bowls to the left and right of the board bear their family crests. The first of the four houses was the house Honinbo, founded by Honinbo Sansa. Honinbo Sansa was a Buddhist monk, and had been appointed Godokoro (minister of Go) by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the unification of Japan in 1603. Buddhist connections They were also nominally Buddhist institutions, with the Honinbo and Hayashi aligned with the Nichiren sect, and the Inoue and Yasui with the Jodo Shu.Go Monthly Review 1963/4 p.41 All players were therefore male. Some outward forms only persisted of that connection, with the oshirogo games being played in Buddhist dress and with shaven heads; the stylish Ota Yuzo was given a waiver of the obligation since he was proud of his hair. After Honinbo Doetsu made a representation that long sleeves were troublesome for the players, a dispensation for shorter sleeves was allowed to them. At least in theory, matters on succession in the houses was subject to the authority of the jisha bugyo, an official regulating religious establishments. Nominations as heir, typically within the iemoto system of the best disciple, who might not be a natural son but in effect adopted, were supposed to be made official. Deaths at an early age particularly affected the Honinbo house, and irregular succession could occur with potential for scandal. Official status The official posts of Meijin and godokoro were awarded, somewhat sporadically, and brought great prestige to the house. In practice backstairs intrigue was often brought to bear on the appointments. More creditably, since the Meijin title could only be awarded to the undisputed master player of the time, there were occasions when it was withheld from two candidates whose merit was very close (an example was Genjo and Chitoku, around 1810-1820). Teaching The mode of teaching, by apprenticeship, brought a consistent and high level of play (though some say the standard sagged in the eighteenth century). Esoteric teaching was normal, with collections of very difficult tsumego being compiled, one of which, the Igo Hatsuy≈çron, is still used for professional training. Prepared variations were used in top games (notably in the blood-vomiting game of Jowa and Akaboshi). Go secrets were state secrets, in effect; since the country was closed to foreigners, in the main, the only international competition was against players from the Ryukyu Islands, but those games are still cited as examples of the difference between strong amateurs and extremely strong players. Dissolution After a while the Honinbo house (of Dosaku) emerged as most prestigious, and the Hayashi house ran into difficulties, eventually being taken over by the Honinbo. The Meiji Restoration threw the system into disarray, but three houses survived some hard times to 1900. Honinbo Shusai arranged that the Honinbo title should become a tournament of the Nihon Kiin after his death (1939). The Yasui house died out; it is not certain whether the Inoue house theoretically continues or not, though it dropped out of the mainstream from the 1920s.

It is situated about 2.5 hours' drive from Melbourne, and 25 minutes from Wangaratta. It is part of the Rural City of Wangaratta. At the 2006 census, Moyhu had a population of 536. At the 2011 census, Moyhu population had declined to 428 - 216 males and 212 females. 50.5% of the population was male; 49.5% female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.7% of the population. Approximately 20% of the Moyhu population consists of children aged 0‚Äì14. Moyhu is situated in the fertile King Valley, near the King River, which flows down from the mountains and joins the Ovens River in Wangaratta. History Moyhu, Mayhu, Moihu from Moydow, Ireland home of original settlers, the Farrell family. The lush 92,000 acres of the King Valley was originally settled by George and William Pitt Faithfull in 1838. The principal residence was initially near Milawa. The King River Crossing between Milawa and the Myrhree Station became Moyhu in the 1860s. George Faithfull's relocated homestead on the Oven's River, Wangaratta, lead to the establishment of that town. Changes to regulations led to the splitting of Oxley Plains Station in 1848. The partnership of the brothers was dissolved. George retained the lease for the northern half of the run. Dominick Farrell became William Pitt Faithfull's (Goulburn NSW) appointed oversee for the southern portion, the 45,000 Edi Pastoral run. He took over from John Moore. The homestead was situated at Black Range Creek, Moyhu South and it was known as Ten Mile Hollow. Farrell purchased the run; with cattle, horses. buildings and 16000 sheep, in 1857 for five thousand pounds. Moyhu was the dairy farm for Edi Station, and was the preferred land for selection under the pre-emptive rights clause, albeit not granted as the principal residence was still at Edi. The earliest selector was Thomas Byrne and his family who arrived in the late 1850s and lived near Meadow Creek. Son Andrew's property developed at Ballenvalley north of Moyhu and he donated the land for the establishment of St John of the Holy Cross Catholic Church. With the death of Dominick snr in 1866 he became the most significant resident of Moyhu. He represented the district as Councillor, set up the Catholic Church, Racing Club, Butter factories, co-operative store and sponsored any club of note. The first land sales were in 1859. Farrell's nephew Dominick arrived in 1863 and married Catherine Byrne. Through the seventies the town hosted, Thursday markets, annual horse races and a timber mill. The name of the town came from Moydow, a village in Longford, Ireland; home of the Farrell clan. The Post Office opened on 1 January 1868. The first known school at Moyhu was a Rural School No 96 which was granted aid by the Board of Education in mid 1871. It was a bark-roof slab building. From this beginning State School 1335 Moyhu was established in January 1874, with a new building on a 2-acre site. A new building was erected in 1907, with major additions made in 1959. A surveying error made when the township was originally surveyed placed the school a mile from the township. The school became important as a group-leader in the district.Vision and Realisation, vol.3, p.937-938. 3061 Moyhu North opened in a slab building in September 1890, but closed at the end of 1891 due to low enrolments.Vision and Realisation, vol.3, p.996. 2464 Moyhu South was later named Edi. It opened in May 1882. In July 1888 it operated half time with 2894 Witfield North, and in 1893 with 2676 Boggy Creek. It resumed full-time in 1895. In 1902 the school was relocated to cater for rural and railway families.Vision and Realisation, vol.3, p.978. During the late 1800s Moyhu was a lively centre, and the home of several butter factories, race meetings, dances and other social events. Victoria's first narrow gauge railway line (2'6\\" gauge) was opened in 1899 and connected the King Valley with the broad gauge line at Wangaratta. The town today Moyhu is the home of several annual events - the Easter Fair at the local primary school every Easter Monday, a Garden Expo every October, Guy Fawkes bonfire, and a popular New Year's Eve celebration in the Lions Park. It is also a central location for popular tourist attractions in the area such as Glenrowan (the scene of Ned Kelly's last stand) and the King Valley gourmet region. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Ovens & King Football League. Media Moyhu receives Television from the local Transmission site near Wodonga and Beechworth. However it does not receive Prime7 News like the Wodonga-Albury region does. Prime7, WIN, Southern Cross Nine, ABC, SBS.

The mission was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on December 7, 2001 aboard a Delta II rocket launch vehicle. The project is sponsored and managed by NASA, while the spacecraft was designed and assembled by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The mission has been extended several times, and has now collected data over an entire solar cycle, which helps in its goal to differentiate the Sun's effects on the atmosphere from other effects. Atmospheric region under study TIMED Mission diagram (NASA) The Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region of the atmosphere to be studied by TIMED is located between 60 and 180 km above the Earth's surface where energy from solar radiation is first deposited into the atmosphere. This can have profound effects on Earth's upper atmospheric regions, particularly during the peak of the Sun's 11-year solar cycle when the greatest amounts of its energy are being released. Understanding these interactions is also important for our understanding of various subjects in geophysics, meteorology, and atmospheric science, as solar radiation is one of the primary driving forces behind atmospheric tides. Changes in the MLT can also affect modern satellite and radio telecommunications. Scientific instruments The spacecraft payload consists of the following four main instruments: *Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI): A spatial-scanning, far-ultraviolet spectrograph designed to globally measure the composition and temperature profiles of the MLT region, as well as its auroral energy inputs. *Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE): A spectrometer and a suite of photometers designed to measure the solar soft X-rays, extreme-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet radiation that is deposited into the MLT region. *TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI): Designed to globally measure the wind and temperature profiles of the MLT region. *Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER): Multichannel radiometer designed to measure heat emitted by the atmosphere over a broad altitude and spectral range, as well as global temperature profiles and sources of atmospheric cooling. The data collected by the satellite's instruments are made freely available to the public.

An engineer installing the magnetorquers had mistakenly recorded the reverse of their actual polarities, which generated a sign error in the flight software. The problem was fixed by temporarily disabling the orbiter's magnetic field sensor and uploading a software patch to fix the sign error. In a separate incident, another software update fixed a problem caused by faulty testing of the sun sensors. After these corrections, the attitude control system functioned as intended. Scientific results TIMED has improved scientific understanding of long-term trends in the upper atmosphere. The SABER instrument has collected a continuous record of water vapor and carbon dioxide levels in the stratosphere and mesosphere.Yue 2019, p. 13452.Yue 2015, p. 7195. SABER is able to collect 1,500 water vapor measurements per day, a vast improvement from previous satellites and ground- based observations.Yue 2019, p. 13458. SABER had a flaw in its optical filter that caused it to overestimate water vapor levels; this error was discovered and the data were corrected.Rong 2019, p. 3-4. Based on the corrected data, SABER found that between 2002 and 2018, water vapor levels in the lower stratosphere were increasing at an average rate of 0.25 ppmv (around 5%) per decade, and in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, water vapor levels were increasing at an average rate of 0.1-0.2 ppmv (around 2-3%) per decade.Yue 2019, p. 13456. Growth in methane levels is thought to be partially responsible for the growth in water vapor levels, as methane decomposes into carbon dioxide and water vapor, but changes driven by the solar cycle may also be responsible.Yue 2019, pp. 13456, 13458. SABER has also monitored carbon dioxide levels in the upper atmosphere. The instrument found that carbon dioxide levels in the upper atmosphere are increasing: at an altitude of , levels were rising at an average rate of 12% per decade.Yue 2015, p. 7197. This rate is faster than what has been predicted by climate models, and suggests that there is more vertical mixing of than previously thought.Yue 2015, p. 7198. By collecting upper atmosphere data, TIMED assists the modeling of environmental impacts. Water vapor and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases and their growth in the upper atmosphere must be factored into climate models. Additionally, upper atmosphere water vapor contributes to ozone depletion.Yue 2019, p. 13459.

The grappling hook was originally used in naval warfare to catch ship rigging so that it could be boarded. They typically have multiple hooks (known as claws or flukes), attached to a rope; it is thrown, dropped, sunk, projected, or fastened directly by hand to where at least one hook may catch and hold. Generally, grappling hooks are used to temporarily secure one end of a rope. They may also be used to dredge for submerged objects. Design A common design has a central shaft with a hole (\\"eye\\") at the shaft base to attach the rope, and three or four equally spaced hooks at the end, arranged so that at least one is likely to catch on some protuberance of the target. Some modern designs feature folding hooks to resist unwanted attachment. Most grappling hooks are thrown by hand, but some used in rescue work are propelled by compressed air (e.g., the Plumett AL-52), mortar, or a rocket. Applications = Military = Grappling hooks are used by combat engineers to breach tactical obstacles. When used as such, the grappling hook is launched in front of an obstacle and dragged backwards to detonate trip-wire- fused land mines, and can be hooked on wire obstacles and pulled to set off booby traps on the wire. Two tools are available for this purpose; the rifle- launched grapnel, a single-use grappling hook placed on the end of an M4/M16 rifle, or the crossbow launched version. A grapnel can clear up to 99% of the trip-wires in a single pass.Field Manual 3-34.2 Combined Arms Breaching Operations. 31 August 2000. Para. C-57 and Table C-2 During WW2 British and German ships would tow grappling hooks in the hope of snagging or damaging enemy submarines; this was a tactic also employed by the Japanese. Grappling hooks were used at the D-Day landings to aid soldiers climbing the cliffs at the Normandy beaches. = Maritime = As well as the Grapnel Anchor grapnels are used in the removal and repair of subsea cables, large ships called Cable Layers drag huge grapnels across the seabed until they snag a cable. In popular culture = Video games = Grappling hooks, grapple guns and their many variants have been a staple in many video games since around the late 1980s. One of the earliest appearances in gaming is in 1987 arcade game Bionic Commando. More recently they are a feature of the Dying Light, Uncharted, and Just Cause video game series.

Early life Hunter was born in Sydenham, England, on 23 November 1899. He attended Beckenham County School for Boys (later known as Beckenham and Penge Grammar School and then Langley Park School for Boys). He left school to volunteer for service in the London Irish Rifles in the First World War. Career After the war Hunter became an advertising copywriter. In the 1930s he performed as a stage magician in Bournemouth. He also wrote popular books on writing for advertising, brain-teasers and conjuring, among many other topics, but his best-known works were about the character Professor Branestawm, originally written for radio. The first book, The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm, was published in hardback in 1933 with illustrations by W. Heath Robinson; the second, Professor Branestawm's Treasure Hunt in 1937 with drawings by James Arnold. George Adamson illustrated the reissue of Professor Branestawm's Treasure Hunt in 1966, and when Norman Hunter brought out his third book in the series in 1970 after a gap of more than thirty years, Adamson provided the illustrations. Two further Professor Branestawm titles were then published with Adamson's drawings. Other artists were to provide illustrations for later books in the series: Gerald Rose; David Hughes; Jill McDonald, and Derek Cousins. Many of the books were reissued in Puffin Books, The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm under Eleanor Graham's editorship in 1946, and many others under Kaye Webb's in the 1960s and 1970s. Hunter returned to London during the Second World War and lived on a boat on the Thames. In 1949 he went to work in South Africa and stopped writing fiction, but after his retirement. in 1970, he once again returned to London, where Thames Television had just produced an eight-part TV series, Professor Branestawm. He continued writing in his retirement and his last book was published in 1983.

In that position, he played a prominent role in the reconstruction of Detroit following a devastating fire in 1805. He promoted an urban design based on radial avenues, as in Washington, DC and Paris. He is also known as one of the founders of the University of Michigan, established by the legislature in 1817. Early life He was born Elias Brevoort Woodward in 1774 in New York, the son of John and Ann Silvester Woodward. His mother was of Flemish ancestry, and his father was of English descent. John Woodward was a merchant and importer, as well as a member of the Continental Army. The family lived in Manhattan on the corner of Pine and Pearl Streets.Woodford, Frank D. Mr Jefferson's Disciple - A Life of Justice Woodward. Michigan State College Press, 1953, pages 17-18 Woodward graduated from Columbia College. After working in Philadelphia as a clerk in the U.S. Treasury Department, he later read the law and practiced as an attorney in Washington, DC.Woodford, page 19 Woodward never married. His biographer, Arthur M. Woodford, describes Woodward as a prototype of Washington Irving's Ichabod Crane. He stood tall, and was thin, sallow, and stooped. His long, narrow face was dominated by a big nose. He had thick, black hair. His contemporaries commented on his slovenliness. While living in Washington, D.C., Woodward was described as \\"a man of middle age, a hardened bachelor who wore nut-brown clothing . . . he slept in his office which was never swept ... and was eccentric and erratic. His friends were few and his practice was so small that he hardly made a living.\\" But while working in Washington, he got to know President Thomas Jefferson, and they shared scientific and education interests. Michigan Territory Woodward's plan following the 1805 fire for Detroit's baroque styled radial avenues and Grand Circus Park President Thomas Jefferson and Woodward knew each other personally. Jefferson appointed Woodward on March 3, 1805, as the Michigan Territory's first Chief Justice. When Woodward arrived in Detroit on June 30, 1805, he found the city in ruins from the devastating fire earlier that month on June 11. Few buildings were left standing. Woodward, with Governor William Hull and associate Justices John Griffin and Frederick Bates, possessed all the legislative power in the Territory. Woodward and Griffin, along with the current Governor and a third judge, held this power from 1805 until the institution of a legislature in 1824. Woodward and Hull bickered almost constantly. One of Woodward's legacies is the Woodward Code: a series of statutes serving as the basis of the Territorial Supreme Court legal procedures. Woodward and Hull developed a new plan for Detroit, in keeping with its status as the capital of the Territory. They based their work on Pierre L'Enfant's layout for Washington, D.C. (as shown in Woodward's notebook). Woodward's plan was ambitious, in line with the newly adopted city motto, (\\"We hope for better days, it will rise again from the ashes\\"). For the first time in Detroit's history, attention shifted fully from its river to its roads. Woodward Avenue in Detroit, originally called Court House Avenue and other names, was popularly named after the justice's work in city planning and rebuilding. Woodward, somewhat in jest, claimed the road's name was simply related to the fact that it traveled toward the wooded area to the north of the city. The alignment of Woodward Avenue seems to coincide exactly with the axis of the pre-settlement Saginaw Trail which followed a straight line route from Detroit to Saginaw via Flint. It is likely that a series of Indian trails once radiated from the approximate location of Campus Martius and this may have inspired the choice of a radial geometry for Woodward's city plan. Woodward proposed a system of hexagonal street blocks, with the Grand Circus at its center. Wide avenues, alternatively 200 feet and 120 feet, were designed to radiate from large circular plazas like spokes from the hub of a wheel. As the city grew, it could develop along the avenues in all directions from the banks of the Detroit River. When Woodward presented his proposal, Detroit had fewer than 1,000 residents. The plan was abandoned after 11 years, but some of its most significant elements had already been implemented. Most prominent of these are the construction of the six main \\"spokes\\" of Woodward, Michigan, Grand River, Gratiot, and Jefferson avenues and Fort Street. Woodward protected the free status of Michigan Territory in regard to slavery. In 1807 as Territorial Justice, he refused to allow the return of two slaves owned by a man in Windsor, Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). Woodward declared that any man \\"coming into this Territory is by law of the land a freeman.\\" Detroit became a station on the Underground Railroad, by which fugitive slaves escaped from the South. After Canada had abolished slavery, many went across the river to escape slave catchers who operated even in the northern border areas. During the War of 1812, Governor (and later Brigadier General) Hull surrendered Detroit to the British without a shot being fired in the Battle of Detroit. While Hull and Justices Bates and Griffin left, Woodward stayed and maintained his judicial status in Detroit during the British occupation. The British offered him the office of Secretary of the Territory, but Woodward declined that offer. Eventually, he became a problem for the British. He was asked to leave the territory and was granted safe passage to New York. The United States regained control of Detroit in 1813. Later years Considered a hero upon his return to Washington, DC, Woodward soon concentrated on science (a lifelong interest). He also promoted the founding of the University of Michigan (in 1817) as a state institution. With Rev. John Monteith and Father Gabriel Richard, Woodward drafted a charter for an institution under the name of the Catholepistemiad or the University of Michigania. On August 26, 1817, the Governor and Judges of the Michigan Territory signed the university act into law. The Catholepistmiad originally had the authority to \\"establish colleges, academies, schools, libraries, museums, atheneums, botanical gardens, laboratories, and other useful literary and scientific institutions consonant to the laws of the United States and of Michigan, and provide for and appoint Directors, Visitors, Curators, Librarians, Instructors and Instructrixes among and throughout the various counties, cities, towns, townships, or other geographical divisions of Michigan.\\"Hinsdale, Burke A. (1906). Demmon, Isaac, ed. History of the University of Michigan. University of Michigan. He urged its development along similar themes to the University of Virginia, which was founded two years after the founding of the University of Michigan (in 1819) by Woodward's friend and former president, Thomas Jefferson. Woodward was described as being among the first to recognize the coming of the scientific age. In 1816, he published his seminal work, A System of Universal Science. Woodward was also a Freemason. August 26, 1824, saw Woodward's return to the judiciary, as President James Monroe appointed him to a judgeship in the new Territory of Florida. Woodward served in that capacity until his death in Tallahassee on June 12, 1827, at the age of 52.

It is a water-soluble enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids. LPL requires ApoC-II as a cofactor. LPL is attached to the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol HDL-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and by heparan sulfated peptidoglycans. It is most widely distributed in adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue, as well as in lactating mammary glands. Synthesis In brief, LPL is secreted from heart, muscle and adipose parenchymal cells as a glycosylated homodimer, after which it is translocated through the extracellular matrix and across endothelial cells to the capillary lumen. After translation, the newly synthesized protein is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The glycosylation sites of LPL are Asn-43, Asn-257, and Asn-359. Glucosidases then remove terminal glucose residues; it was once believed that this glucose trimming is responsible for the conformational change needed for LPL to form homodimers and become catalytically active. In the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharides are further altered to result in either two complex chains, or two complex and one high-mannose chain. In the final protein, carbohydrates account for about 12% of the molecular mass (55-58 kDa). Homodimerization is required before LPL can be secreted from cells. After secretion, LPL is carried across endothelial cells and presented into the capillary lumen by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1. Structure Crystal structures of LPL complexed with GPIHBP1 have been reported.; ; LPL is composed of two distinct regions: the larger N-terminus domain that contains the lipolytic active site, and the smaller C-terminus domain. These two regions are attached by a peptide linker. The N-terminus domain has an Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase fold, which is a globular structure containing a central Œ≤ sheet surrounded by Œ± helices. The C-terminus domain is a Œ≤ sandwich formed by two Œ≤ sheet layers, and resembles an elongated cylinder. Mechanism Image 1: The proposed LPL homodimer structure; N-terminal domains in blue, C-terminal domains in orange. Lid region blocking the active site is shown in dark blue. Triglyceride binds to the C-terminal domain and the lid region, inducing a conformation change in LPL to make the active site accessible. The active site of LPL is composed of the conserved Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 triad. Other important regions of the N-terminal domain for catalysis includes an oxyanion hole (Trp-55, Leu-133), a lid region (residues 216-239), as well as a Œ≤5 loop (residues 54-64). The ApoC-II binding site is currently unknown, but it is predicted that residues on both N-and C-terminal domains are necessary for this interaction to occur. The C-terminal domain appears to confer LPL‚Äôs substrate specificity; it has a higher affinity for large triacylglyceride-rich lipoproteins than cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. The C-terminal domain is also important for binding to LDL‚Äôs receptors. Both the N-and C-terminal domains contain heparin binding sites distal to the lipid binding sites; LPL therefore serves as a bridge between the cell surface and lipoproteins. Importantly, LPL binding to the cell surface or receptors is not dependent on its catalytic activity. The LPL non-covalent homodimer has a head-to-tail arrangement of the monomers. The Ser/Asp/His triad is in a hydrophobic groove that is blocked from solvent by the lid. Upon binding to ApoC-II and lipid in the lipoprotein, the C-terminal domain presents the lipid substrate to the lid region. The lipid interacts with both the lid region and the hydrophobic groove at the active site; this causes the lid to move, providing access to the active site. The Œ≤5 loop folds back into the protein core, bringing one of the electrophiles of the oxyanion hole into position for lipolysis. The glycerol backbone of the lipid is then able to enter the active site and is hydrolyzed. Two molecules of ApoC-II can attach to each LPL dimer.> It is estimated that up to forty LPL dimers may act simultaneously on a single lipoprotein. In regard to kinetics, it is believed that release of product into circulation is the rate-limiting step in the reaction.  Function  LPL gene encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to IDL and then to LDL. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. Regulation LPL is controlled transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. The circadian clock may be important in the control of Lpl mRNA levels in peripheral tissues. LPL isozymes are regulated differently depending on the tissue. For example, insulin is known to activate LPL in adipocytes and its placement in the capillary endothelium. By contrast, insulin has been shown to decrease expression of muscle LPL. Muscle and myocardial LPL is instead activated by glucagon and adrenaline. This helps to explain why during fasting, LPL activity increases in muscle tissue and decreases in adipose tissue, whereas after a meal, the opposite occurs. Consistent with this, dietary macronutrients differentially affect adipose and muscle LPL activity. After 16 days on a high-carbohydrate or a high-fat diet, LPL activity increased significantly in both tissues 6 hours after a meal of either composition, but there was a significantly greater rise in adipose tissue LPL in response to the high-carbohydrate diet compared to the high-fat diet. There was no difference between the two diets' effects on insulin sensitivity or fasting LPL activity in either tissue. The concentration of LPL displayed on endothelial cell surface cannot be regulated by endothelial cells, as they neither synthesize nor degrade LPL. Instead, this regulation occurs by managing the flux of LPL arriving at the lipolytic site and by regulating the activity of LPL present on the endothelium. A key protein involved in controlling the activity of LPL is ANGPTL4, which serves as a local inhibitor of LPL. Induction of ANGPTL4 accounts for the inhibition of LPL activity in white adipose tissue during fasting. Growing evidence implicates ANGPTL4 in the physiological regulation of LPL activity in a variety of tissues. An ANGPTL3-4-8 model was proposed to explain the variations of LPL activity during the fed-fast cycle. Specifically, feeding induces ANGPTL8, activating the ANGPTL8‚ÄìANGPTL3 pathway, which inhibits LPL in cardiac and skeletal muscles, thereby making circulating triglycerides available for uptake by white adipose tissue, in which LPL activity is elevated owing to diminished ANGPTL4; the reverse is true during fasting, which suppresses ANGPTL8 but induces ANGPTL4, thereby directing triglycerides to muscles. The model suggests a general framework for how triglyceride trafficking is regulated. Clinical significance Lipoprotein lipase deficiency leads to hypertriglyceridemia (elevated levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream). In mice, overexpression of LPL has been shown to cause insulin resistance, and to promote obesity. A high adipose tissue LPL response to a high-carbohydrate diet may predispose toward fat gain. One study reported that subjects gained more body fat over the next four years if, after following a high-carbohydrate diet and partaking of a high-carbohydrate meal, they responded with an increase in adipose tissue LPL activity per adipocyte, or a decrease in skeletal muscle LPL activity per gram of tissue. LPL expression has been shown to be a prognostic predictor in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this haematological disorder, LPL appears to provide fatty acids as an energy source to malignant cells. Thus, elevated levels of LPL mRNA or protein are considered to be indicators of poor prognosis. Interactions Lipoprotein lipase has been shown to interact with LRP1. It is also a ligand for Œ±2M, GP330, and VLDL receptors. LPL has been shown to be a ligand for LRP2, albeit at a lower affinity than for other receptors; however, most of the LPL- dependent VLDL degradation can be attributed to the LRP2 pathway. In each case, LPL serves as a bridge between receptor and lipoprotein. While LPL is activated by ApoC-II, it is inhibited by ApoCIII. In other organisms The LPL gene is highly conserved across vertebrates. Lipoprotein lipase is involved in lipid transport in the placentae of live bearing lizards (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii).

This species has sometimes been placed in a separate genus, Satanellus.  Life history  The northern quoll is the smallest of the four Australian quoll species. Females are smaller than males, with adult females weighing between 350 and 690 g and adult males 540 and 1120 g. Head and body length ranges from 270‚Äì370 mm (adult males) to 249‚Äì310 mm (adult females). Tail length ranges between 202 and 345 mm. Northern quolls feed primarily on invertebrates, but also consume fleshy fruit (particularly figs), and a wide range of vertebrates, including small mammals, birds, lizards, snakes, and frogs. They also scavenge on roadkills, around campsites, and in garbage tins. A remarkable feature of this species is that the males show complete die-off after mating, leaving the females to raise the young alone. Females have eight teats in a pouch, but apparently give birth to more than eight young which must wriggle their way to the pouch and compete for a teat to survive. In a study in Western Australia's Kimberley region, the testosterone levels of males peaked in July, and females gave birth in July or August. In the wild, males live for about one year, while the maximum recorded for a wild female was about three years of age. In rocky habitats, the lifespan of both sexes appears to be increased to two or three years, and individuals are larger than those living in savanna habitats, possibly due to better habitat and reduced predation.  Range and habitat  The northern quoll occurs from the Pilbara region of Western Australia across the Northern Territory to south east Queensland. Their historical range extended uninterrupted from S.E Queensland to the Kimberleys in Western Australia.Menkhorst. P, Knight. F \\"A field Guide to the Mammals of Australia\\" Oxford University Press South Melbourne, 2001, p. 48 There are several disjunct populations. This quoll species is most abundant in rocky ranges and open eucalypt forest.  Conservation status  1863 illustration by John Gould The northern quoll is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN. The species is now absent from many parts of its former range, particularly the savanna country. In 2005 it was listed as Endangered under Australian Commonwealth legislation (EPBC Act). Threats are predation by feral cats, dingoes and foxes, particularly after fire or grazing has removed protective ground cover. Destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of the quoll's habitat due to land clearing, grazing, pasture improvement, and mining are also significant. Quolls are also susceptible to being run over on roads. The current major threat to the northern quoll in the northern and western portion of its range is the spread of cane toads. Like many other native Australian species, northern quolls are poisoned after eating or mouthing cane toads. Cane toads were originally introduced in Queensland, but have now occupied the Top End of the Northern Territory, including Kakadu National Park and the Darwin area, and entered the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where they are established around Kununurra and Lake Argyle. Immediately after cane toad invasion of Kakadu, quolls became extinct at one study site and declined from 45 individuals to five at another site. The northern quoll may cease to exist in most areas in the Top End once the cane toad population completely overlaps the northern quoll's range. However, remnant populations of northern quolls still persist in Queensland where cane toads have been present for decades. These persisting Queensland quoll populations are naturally toad averse (as observed on remote cameras). One of the northern quoll populations studied in Kakadu during the recent cane toad invasion, had a few individuals survive the invasion. These individuals were, likely similar to the Queensland quolls, genetically averse to the toads. In 2003, to help protect northern quolls, numerous quolls were transferred to the toad-free English Company Islands (Astell and Pobassoo Islands), off the coast of Arnhem Land. Quolls thrived on these islands, with an estimated population of 2193 female northern quolls on Astell Island by 2014. In 2017, quolls from Astell Island were collected, trained via conditioned taste aversion to avoid attacking cane toads and reintroduced to Kakadu National Park. This reintroduction attempt saw the release both toad-trained (22) and toad-naive (9) northern quolls to an area of Kakadu that previous had quolls but where they had recently gone locally extinct due to the invasion of cane toads. Although the toad-trained quolls survived longer than those that received no toad training, ultimately this reintroduction population rapidly went extinct because of dingo predation. Subsequently, research comparing antipredator behaviours of quolls from Astell Island and mainland Queensland determined that quolls conserved on this island had lost their ability to recognise and avoid both dingo and cats, predators they have co-evolved with on mainland Australia for at least 3500 and 150 years respectively. This study suggests that animals conserved in complete isolation from predators can rapidly lose evolved antipredator behaviours, in this case in only 13 generations, when they are no longer maintained via natural selection.

Jagger currently serves as a Council of Europe goodwill ambassador, founder and chair of the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, member of the Executive Director's Leadership Council of Amnesty International USA, and a trustee of the Amazon Charitable Trust. She was married to Mick Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, from 1971 until 1978.  Early life and education  Jagger was born in Managua, Nicaragua. Her father was a successful import- export merchant and her mother a housewife. They divorced when Bianca was ten and she stayed with her mother, who had to take care of three children on a small income. At the age of 16, she changed her name from Blanca to Bianca. She received a scholarship to study political science in France at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. She was also influenced by Gandhi's non- violent success and Eastern philosophy at large. She travelled extensively in India. Marriage, family and public life Bianca met Mick Jagger at a party after a Rolling Stones concert in France in September 1970. On 12 May 1971, while she was four months pregnant, the couple married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Saint-Tropez, France, and she became his first and only wife. The couple's only child, a daughter named Jade, was born on 21 October 1971, in Paris, France. In May 1978, she filed for divorce on the grounds of his adultery with model Jerry Hall. Bianca later said \\"My marriage ended on my wedding day.\\" In addition to her extensive charitable works, Jagger had a public reputation as a jet-setter and party-goer in the 1970s and early 1980s, being closely associated in the public mind with New York City's nightclub Studio 54. She also became known particularly as a friend of pop artist Andy Warhol. Jagger has dual nationality, as a naturalised British citizen and citizen of Nicaragua. Jagger has two granddaughters from her daughter Jade, Assisi Lola (born in 1992) and Amba Isis (born in 1996) and a grandson born in 2014. She became a great-grandmother in 2014 through her granddaughter Assisi. Jagger caused a minor controversy in May 2012 when she took flash photographs during a performance of Philip Glass' Einstein on the Beach at the Barbican in London.  Epiphany  In 1981, Jagger was part of a US congressional delegation stationed at a UN refugee camp in Honduras. At one point during her official visit, the entire staff saw about 40 captured refugees marched away at gunpoint towards El Salvador by a death squad. Armed with nothing but cameras to document the raid, Jagger and the delegation trailed the squad along a river towards the Honduran-Salvadoran border. When both groups were within auditory range of each other, Jagger and the staff shouted at the M16 rifle equipped raiders, \\"You will have to kill us all!\\" The squad considered the situation, approached the group, relieved them of their cameras, and released the cache of captives. A transformation had thus begun for Jagger. In subsequent interviews, Jagger has recounted this incident as \\"a turning point in my life.\\"  Activism  Bianca Jagger engaging for human rights in Tibet, Vienna 2012\\\\. Bianca Jagger founded the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, which she chairs. She returned to Nicaragua to look for her parents after the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake, which destroyed Managua, the capital, leaving a toll of more than 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands homeless. In early 1979, Jagger visited Nicaragua with an International Red Cross delegation and was shocked by the brutality and oppression that the Somoza regime carried out there. This persuaded her to commit herself to the issues of justice and human rights. In the 1980s, she worked to oppose US government intervention in Nicaragua after the Sandinista revolution. She has also opposed the death penalty and defended the rights of women and of indigenous peoples in Latin America, notably the Yanomami tribe in Brazil against the invasion of gold miners. She spoke up for victims of the conflicts in Bosnia and Serbia. Her writings were published in several newspapers (including The New York Times and the Sunday Express). From the late 1970s, she collaborated with many humanitarian organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. She was also a member of the Twentieth Century Task Force to Apprehend War Criminals, and a trustee of the Amazon Charitable Trust. She gave a reading at the start of the memorial service in London's Westminster Cathedral, which was timed to coincide with the funeral in Brazil of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot eight times on a tube-train after being mistaken for a suicide bomber in London. In March 2007, she became involved with Sarah Teather and the campaign to close Guantanamo Bay. In March 2002, Jagger travelled to Afghanistan with a delegation of fourteen women, organised by Global Exchange to support Afghan women's projects. On 16 December 2003, Jagger was nominated Council of Europe Goodwill Ambassador. From 2007 to 2009, she was Chair of the World Future Council. On 7 July 2007, Jagger presented at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg. In July 2008, she was a signatory to a petition to the Catholic bishops of England and Wales to allow the wider celebration of the traditional Latin Mass. In January 2009, Jagger addressed some 12,000 people who rallied in Trafalgar Square in protest against an Israeli offensive in the Gaza several days earlier.

She has served as IUCN's Global Ambassador for the Bonn Challenge a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of the world's degraded and deforested lands by 2020. On 8 October 2010, she spoke at the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) 2010 world conference on moving beyond petroleum and \\"Crimes against Present and Future Generations\\". In June 2012, Jagger, along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Airbus launched an online campaign called Plant a Pledge initiative, which aims to restore 150 million hectares of forest around the world by 2020. On 21 November 2013, Jagger delivered the prestigious 12th annual Longford Lecture titled \\"Ending Violence Against Women and Girls, and the Culture of Impunity: achieving the missing Millennium Development Goal target\\", chaired by Jon Snow. Prior to the 2015 UK general election, she was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.  Awards  For her international work on behalf of humanitarian causes, Jagger has earned numerous awards, including: * 1983 Honorary Doctorate of Humanities degree from Stonehill College in Massachusetts * 1994 United Nations Earth Day award * 1996 Hispanic Federation of New York City's Humanitarian Award * 1996 Woman of the Year Title from the Boys Town of Italy * 1996 Abolitionist of the Year Award from the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty * 1997 Green Globe award from the Rainforest Alliance * 1997 Amnesty International USA Media Spotlight Award for Leadership * 1997 Inducted to the Hall of Fame in Miami Children's Hospital Foundation * 1998 American Civil Liberties Union Award * 2000 Champion of Justice Award * 2003 International Award from International ServiceInternational Service Past Winners www.internationalservice.org.uk * 2003 'special recognition' as a Woman of Peace at the Global Exchange Human Rights Awards in San Francisco with Arundhati Roy, Barbara Lee and Kathy Kelly. * 2004 Women's World Award (World Achievement) from Mikhail Gorbachev * 2004 Right Livelihood Award * 2006 World Citizenship Award from The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation * 2006 Office of the Americas Peace and Justice Award * 2008 Honorary Doctorate of Human Rights degree from Simmons College in Massachusetts  Film and television  After Dark on 6 August 1988 Bianca also appeared in several movies and TV shows: * Cocksucker Blues (1972, documentary about the Rolling Stones' 1972 North American tour) * Trick or Treat (1975) (unfinished movie) * Flesh Color (Couleur chair) (1978) * All You Need Is Cash (1978, as Martini) * The American Success Company (1979; as Corrine) * The Cannonball Run (1981, as sheik's sister) * In Our Hands (1984) * Miami Vice (1985) TV episode \\"Free Verse\\" * Street Hawk (1985) TV episode \\"The Unthinkable\\" * Hotel (1986) TV episode \\"Separation\\" * The Colbys (1987) TV episode \\"Betrayal\\" * After Dark (an extended appearance in 1988 on the British TV programme, discussed here). * C.H.U.D.

This assists in computation of singular homology groups, as sometimes after excising an appropriately chosen subspace we obtain something easier to compute.  Theorem  = Statement = If U\\\\subseteq A \\\\subseteq X are as above, we say that U can be excised if the inclusion map of the pair (X \\\\setminus U,A \\\\setminus U ) into (X, A) induces an isomorphism on the relative homologies: H_n(X \\\\setminus U,A \\\\setminus U) \\\\cong H_n(X,A) The theorem states that if the closure of U is contained in the interior of A, then U can be excised. Often, subspaces which do not satisfy this containment criterion still can be excised --it suffices to be able to find a deformation retract of the subspaces onto subspaces that do satisfy it. = Proof Sketch = The proof of the excision theorem is quite intuitive, though the details are rather involved. The idea is to subdivide the simplices in a relative cycle in (X, A) to get another chain consisting of \\"smaller\\" simplices, and continuing the process until each simplex in the chain lies entirely in the interior of A or the interior of X \\\\setminus U. Since these form an open cover for X and simplices are compact, we can eventually do this in a finite number of steps. This process leaves the original homology class of the chain unchanged (this says the subdivision operator is chain homotopic to the identity map on homology). In the relative homology H_n(X, A), then, this says all the terms contained entirely in the interior of U can be dropped without affecting the homology class of the cycle. This allows us to show that the inclusion map is an isomorphism, as each relative cycle is equivalent to one that avoids U entirely.

During the American Civil War, the railroad was a vital link between Richmond, the Confederate capital, and the rest of the Confederacy.The line between Richmond and Danville was long. The railroad had also constructed a between Manchester, Virginia, and Lower Rocketts, Virginia, a line between Belle Isle Junction, Virginia, and Belle Isle (Richmond, Virginia) and a line between Granite, Virginia, and Granite Quarry, Virginia. ICC, Southern Ry. Co. valuation report, 1931, p. 219. After the Civil War, the railroad grew to become the 3,300-mile Richmond and Danville Railroad Company System. Placed in receivership in 1892, the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company was sold in 1894 and conveyed into the new Southern Railway Company in 1896 and 1897. History =Beginnings (1847-61)= The new Richmond and Danville Railroad was championed by Whitmell P. Tunstall, a lawyer in Chatham, Virginia, who was also a member of the Virginia General Assembly. After many years, Tunstall secured a charter for the new railroad on March 9, 1847. In the same year, the state of Virginia took a 60% interest in the capital stock of the company, which it would hold until 1871.ICC, Southern Ry. Co. valuation report, 1931, p. 556. Construction on the line began on January 31, 1848 under the supervision of Col. Andrew Talcott, who was later to become the Richmond and Danville's general manager. By 1850, the new railroad had reached Coalfield Station, near the coal mines in an area known today as Midlothian in western Chesterfield County. There, it competed with the mule-powered Chesterfield Railroad. Lawsuits followed, but the older railroad, the first in Virginia, was quickly supplanted by the competition. The Virginia General Assembly allowed the Richmond and Danville Railroad to buy the Chesterfield Railroad for as much as two hundred thousand dollars in 1848. By the end of 1851, the new line had reached Jetersville in Amelia County. Two years later, it was completed to a point near Drakes Branch, and had been graded to South Boston in Halifax County. On May 16, 1856, the railroad had finished construction of the main line.

In 1862, the Richmond and York River Railroad played a crucial role in George McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. After the war, it was to be acquired by the Richmond and Danville (R&D;) Railroad. The Richmond and Danville Railroad was an essential transportation link for the Confederacy throughout the war. It provided the production of south-central Virginia to Richmond. When the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad was cut in 1864, the R&D;'s connection with the Piedmont Railroad was the only remaining connection from Richmond to the rest of the South. During the Civil War, the Confederate Army was handicapped by a lack of supplies when there often were plenty of supplies in the depots, but the quartermaster corps of the southern army was unable to deliver the goods efficiently. In one case, however, the war finally forced the Confederate government to over-rule objections by North Carolina. That state had blocked construction of a rail connection from Greensboro to Danville, fearing that after the war trade from North Carolina's Piedmont would continue to flow to Richmond via the R&D.; Following successful Union attacks on April 1, 1865, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee decided to abandon Petersburg and head west and south in an attempt to join Gen. Joseph Johnston's army in North Carolina. After evacuating Richmond the next day, on April 2, 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet left Richmond on the R&D.; The departing Confederates set fire to the bridge across the James River between Richmond and Manchester. They traveled to Danville, where they attempted to set up a temporary government. On reaching Amelia Courthouse during the morning of April 4, 1865, Lee's first thought was for the commissary stores. He found ordnance supplies in abundance, but no food. Lee waited 24 hours in vain there for R&D; trains to arrive with badly needed supplies. Union cavalry, meanwhile, sped forward and cut the Richmond & Danville at Jetersville. Lee had to abandon the railroad, and his army stumbled across rolling country towards Lynchburg. On the morning of April 9, 1865, Palm Sunday, Lee met Grant in the front parlor of Wilmer McLean's home near Appomattox Court House to surrender. =Reconstruction (1865‚Äì94)= 1891 map of Richmond and Danville Railroad and connections Piedmont Air Line System advertisement 1882 1893 map (also showing the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad and connections) With the support of Virginia Governor Francis H. Pierpont, Algernon S. Buford became president of the R&D; on September 13, 1865. Repair work began on war-damaged tracks, including the bridge across the James River between Manchester and Richmond. Over the next 20 years, Buford, Richmonder James H. Dooley, and other leaders extended the railroad's trackage to 3,000 miles through construction and acquisition. Early acquisitions included the Piedmont Railroad in 1866 and a 25-year lease of the North Carolina Railroad in 1871. In 1871, the Southern Railway Security Company acquired the 60 percent stake in the railroad held by the state of Virginia. Another large shareholder was the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.ICC, Southern Ry. Co. valuation report, 1931, p. 557. In 1877, Buford joined with Andrew Talcott, Thomas Mann Talcott, and others to form the Bon Air Land and Improvement Company, a land investment that added a resort train stop in Bon Air six miles east of Richmond. In 1880, control of the R&D; was acquired by the Clyde interests that controlled the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Rail Road Company. In 1881, the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company was organized to develop and expand the R&D;, whose charter limited its control of connecting railroads. In 1882, the R&D;, along with the North Carolina Railroad, Northwestern North Carolina Railroad, Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, Atlanta and Charlotte Air-Line Railway and the Columbia and Greenville Railroad lines were being operated as the Piedmont Air-Line System advertised as the shortest line between New York, New Orleans and Texas. One improvement that year was the installation of two steam powered Nutter car hoists in north Danville, Virginia in order to allow truck exchange to allow cars to be exchanged across the break of gauge with the Virginia Midland Railway.T.M.R.

In or about 1886, the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company acquired a majority of R&D; Company stock, and thus control of the railroad.ICC, Southern Ry.

By 1890, the R&D; System covered of track in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. However, the R&D; System had become financially unstable during all the growth. After the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company, declared bankruptcy, the R&D; Company was pulled down with it. Receivers were appointed to take possession of its property, including its subsidiaries, on June 15, 1892. =Southern Railway System (1894-1982)= On June 18, 1894, the R&D; was sold in foreclosure. Its property was surrendered to Southern Railway Company for operation on July 1, 1894, even though the deeds of conveyance were not completed and filed until later. Reorganized by J.P. Morgan and his New York banking firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company, the R&D; was merged with five other railroads to form the new Southern Railway. The R&D; property was formally conveyed to Southern Railway Company by deeds dated January 9, 1896, and August 30, 1897.ICC, Southern Ry. Co. valuation report, 1931, p. 212. The Southern Railway Company, incorporated in Virginia on the same date, June 18, 1894, controlled over of line at its inception. Samuel Spencer became Southern's first president. =Norfolk Southern (1982-present)= Norfolk Southern Corporation, a holding corporation, acquired control of Norfolk and Western Railway Company and Southern Railway Company and their affiliates and subsidiaries on June 1, 1982, after approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Effective December 31, 1990, Southern Railway Company changed its name to Norfolk Southern Railway Company. Norfolk and Western Railway Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Railway Company rather than a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Corporation. In 1999, the system grew substantially with the acquisition of over half of Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Officers =Presidents= * Whitmell P. Tunstall (1847 ‚Äì February 19, 1854) * A. F.

The first sejmiks were regional assemblies in the Kingdom of Poland (before 1572), though they gained significantly more influence in the later era of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (18th century). Sejmiks arose around the late 14th and early 15th centuries and existed until the end of the Commonwealth in 1795, following the partitions of the Commonwealth. In a limited form, some sejmiks existed in partitioned Poland (1795‚Äì1918), and later in the Second Polish Republic (1918‚Äì1939). In modern Poland, since 1999, the term has revived with the voivodeship sejmiks (sejmiki wojew√≥dztwa), referring to the elected councils of each of the 16 voivodeships. The competencies of sejmiks varied over time, and there were also geographical differences. Often, numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure. Almost always presided over by the marshal, sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm, and sometimes would give such delegates binding instructions. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they effectively supplanted the inefficient national sejm. Etymology The word sejm and sejmik are derived from old Czech sejmovat, which means \\"to bring together\\" or \\"to summon\\".  History  The traditions of a sejmik can be traced to the institution of the wiec that actually predates the Polish state. They originated from gatherings of nobility, formed for military and consultative purposes. Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks, with some proposed dates being 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce) and 1454 (the Nieszawa Statutes). Geographically, sejmiks first arose in central Poland (Greater Poland province). Over the next century or so, they spread to other provinces of Poland, and finally, by the 16th century, to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, in a privilege granted to the szlachta (Polish nobility) by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, when the king agreed to consult with the nobility concerning certain decisions. Casimir's recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the magnates, and counteract it with the middle nobility. With the creation of a national Sejm in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished. Still, the sejmikis continued to play an important role in the governance of Poland as the most direct form of political enfranchisement of the nobility. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had about 70 sejmiks (out of those, 24 were in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Jacek Jƒôdruch notes a trend of an increasing number of sejmiks over time, from about 16 in the 15th century to 104 by the late 18th century, as nobility sought to meet in places that required less travel time. Stanis≈Çaw P≈Çaza also estimates about 100 at the turn of the 18th century. Those sejmiks elected 170 deputies (48 from Lithuania). Most sejmiks elected 2 deputies, but there were exceptions.For a full list of sejmiks and the numbers of deputies elected, see Sejm walny#Composition Wojciech Kriegseisen notes that until the late 18th century, there were 44 sejmiks in Poland proper (the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland), 24 in Lithuania, and 1 in Inflanty province. The sejmik's role grew again in the late 17th century, as central power weakened. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they often set their own time limits‚Äîthat is, they extended their authorized periods of operation. In the face of an inefficient central government, with the national Sejm often disrupted by the liberum veto and the office of starosta losing much of its importance, sejmiks administered a portion of the taxes, and raised their own military (wojsko powiatowe). This period, which was known as the \\"rule of sejmiks\\" (rzƒÖdy sejmikowe), was brought to an end by acts of the one-day Silent Sejm (Polish: sejm niemy) of 1717, which removed most taxation and military competences from the sejmiks. Some sejmiks were also affected by liberum veto until it was abolished for sejmiks in 1766; this was not always the case, as some decided to forgo unanimity and move to majority rule. Where the middle nobility had been the leading force at the sejmiks in the 16th century, the magnates became increasingly influential in the 18th century. This stemmed from their ability to bribe masses of poorly educated, landless nobility (known as magnate's \\"clients\\" or \\"clientele\\"), as all nobles were eligible to vote in the sejmiks. Sejmiks in Lithuania were dominated by the magnates to a greater extent than those in Poland proper, as the Lithuanian magnates were more powerful than their Polish counterparts. The magnate-dominated sejmiks, which gathered impoverished nobility, have been described as more concerned with eating and drinking than debate; for the poorest of nobility, they were a rare occasion to participate in feasts sponsored by the magnates. When they met, the drunken nobility was known to fight among themselves, which on occasion led to fatalities. Sejmiks were significantly reformed by the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized as part of the Constitution of 3 May. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks. Although the independent existence of the Commonwealth ended with the partitions of Poland in 1795, the institution of the sejmik continued, albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion. In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition. In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag). Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian partition and Austrian partition, but they did not bear the name of sejmiks. After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were restored in the Second Polish Republic, although they were called sejms rather than sejmiks. They included the short-lived Sejm of Central Lithuania (1921‚Äì1922); the three voivodeship sejms (Silesian Parliament, Greater Poland Sejm, and Pomeranian Sejm, 1920‚Äì1939), which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the county sejmiks, of which there were 264 in 1939. The existence of these institutions was interrupted by the occupation of Poland during the Second World War, and they were not reestablished in the era of communist Poland. The sejmiks were revived again after the fall of communism in modern Poland. Since 1999, the term sejmik (in full, sejmik wojew√≥dztwa) has been used to refer to the elected council of each of the 16 voivodeships or regions (see voivodeship sejmik). The word sejmik was chosen by lawmakers in order to eliminate the term rada wojew√≥dzka (voivodeship council), which conjured memories of voivodeship people's councils during the communist Poland era. Sejmiks of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth = Features = Sejmiks were usually held in a large, open field. The nobility would elect a presiding officer (marsza≈Çek sejmiku: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms. (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to the chairman of the voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal. Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik. It is estimated that most sejmiks drew around 4 to 6% of eligible participants. =Types= Nobility fighting at a sejmik, Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine Historians distinguish several types of sejmiks, depending on their geographical scope: * General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held in western Poland (Greater Poland) at Ko≈Ço, in southern Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at SƒÖdowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wo≈Çkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their goal was to agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper. * Provincial, Territorial, Voivodeship or County (Polish: ziemski, Latin conventiones particulares, conventiones terrestrae). The names of these sejmiks varied depending on their administrative level and local traditions; P≈Çaza lists powiat sejmiks (county sejmiks; sejmiki powiatowe), ziemia sejmiks (territorial sejmiks; sejmiki ziemskie), voivodeship sejmiks (sejmiki wojew√≥dzkie) and provincial sejmiks (sejmiki prowincjonalne). A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks, and moving upwards to ziemia, voivodeship, general (of several voivodeships) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final, national sejm. Almost all ziemias had their own sejmiks, but the importance of the sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous (that is, whether it was part of a voivodeship). Powiat sejms were common in Lithuania, but were rare in the Crown of Poland, where instead voivodeship sejms were much more common. Some voivodeships could hold a single voivodeship sejmik, and others might be covered by more than one sejmik. The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm. Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms. They rose in importance again in the second half of the 17th century, as the central Sejm grew weaker. Kriegseisen, quoting Adam Lity≈Ñski, argues that there was only one type of sejmik and that the only difference between various sejmiks was the purpose for which they were convened. Nonetheless other scholars often distinguish between different types of sejmiks. Juliusz Bardach and Jƒôdruch, for example, divide sejmiks based on their purpose as follows: * Pre-sejm (Polish: przedsejmowe) sejmiks were convened by the king who sent a writ (legacja kr√≥lewska) to each sejmik, outlining the reasons the next Sejm would be held. Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (poslowie), depending on the size and importance of the sejmik's territory, to the ordinary General Sejm (Polish: Sejm Walny) that was held every two years, and to any extraordinary General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency. Sometimes pre- sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships ‚Äì in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or even give the deputies full freedom. These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century. * Relational or Debriefing (Polish: relacyjne) sejmiks heard the reports of deputies returned from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (konstytucje sejmowe) decreed by the Sejm. They passed specific instructions with regards to the execution of sejm decrees, and other local resolutions. Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century. * Electoral (Polish: elekcyjne) sejmiks elected higher voivodeship officials, judges in particular. They were convened irregularly, as such offices were usually held for life. Several candidates would be nominated, and the king would make the final appointment from among them. These sejmiks arose in the 15th century. * Deputational or Judicial (Polish: deputackie) sejmiks met on a yearly basis and elected deputies (deputaci) to tribunals (Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal) from the times of King Stefan Batory onwards (starting in 1578 in Poland, and from 1581 in Lithuania). * Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw voivodeship self-government. Often, they were held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century. * Hooded (Polish: kapturowe) sejmiks had special powers during an interregnum. These sejmiks were organized as confederations, and would elect confederation officials. The name was derived from hoods worn in the period of royal mourning. These sejmiks began during the interregnum of 1572. Assessment and historiography Kriegseisen notes that the institution of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that‚Äîsensationalist‚Äîand should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common. Kriegseisen also remarks that there is a myth about the uniqueness of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (Silesia, Prussia, Brandenburg).

It remains the western frontier of present-day Pakistan, extending from the Pamir Knot in the north to the Koh-i-Malik Siah in the west,The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 2 and separating the modern Pakistani frontier regions of North- West Frontier Province (renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan from neighbouring Afghanistan in the west. The borderline between is officially known as the Durand Line and divides Pashtun inhabitants of these provinces from Pashtuns in eastern Afghanistan. The two main gateways on the North West Frontier are the Khyber and Bolan Passes. Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has been repeatedly invaded through these northwestern routes. With the expansion of the Russian Empire into Central Asia in the twentieth century, stability of the Frontier and control of Afghanistan became cornerstones of defensive strategy for British India. Much of the Frontier was occupied by Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century, and then taken over by the East India Company when it annexed the Punjab in 1849.The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 10 Between 1849 and 1947 the military history of the frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending Pashtun (or Pathan) tribes, punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan. Many British officers who went on to distinguished command in the First and Second World Wars learnt their soldiering on the North-West Frontier, which they called the Grim.Wilkinson-Latham, pp. 3 & 38 Contestants =Afghanistan= In 1747 when Ahmad KhƒÅn AbdƒÅlƒ´ seized control of Kandahar, Kabul, and Peshawar, and, as Ahmad Shah Durrani, was proclaimed Shah of the Afghans.The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 8 He went on to conquer Herat and Khorassan, and established an empire from the Oxus to the Indus.Barthorp 2002, p. 14 On his death in 1773, the Afghan domain included Baluchistan, Sindh, the Punjab, and Kashmir. Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son Timur Shah Durrani, whose rule of twenty years saw the Afghan tide begin to ebb. Timur left many sons but no heir, and the resultant internecine struggles for the throne lasted more than thirty years. During this period the Punjab was effectively ceded to its erstwhile governor Ranjit Singh, Iran recovered Khorassan, and Sindh broke away. In 1813 Sikh forces from the Punjab crossed the Indus and seized the old Mughal fort at Attock. In 1819 Kashmir was lost, and west of the Indus Derajat also. Four years later the winter capital at Peshawar came under attack.Barthorp 2002, pp. 15-18 In 1826 Dost Mohammad Khan emerged as undisputed ruler in Kabul, and was there proclaimed Emir.Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 9 He defeated a further attempt to oust him by his exiled rival Shuja Shah Durrani in 1833; however the Sikhs seized all of Peshawar the following year. In 1837 Dost Mohammad launched a counter-attack through the Khyber, but the Afghan force was halted at Jamrud Fort.Barthorp 2002, p. 18 Dost Mohammad had sought assistance from the East India Company against the resurgent Punjab, but was rebuffed. So Dost Mohammad turned to Imperial Russia for help. =Sikh Empire (1799‚Äì1849)= Overview of Afghanistan and the Countries on the Northwest Border of India 1842 Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjabi: ‡®Æ‡®π‡®æ‡®∞‡®æ‡®ú‡®æ ‡®∞‡®£‡®ú‡©Ä‡®§ ‡®∏‡®ø‡©∞‡®ò ), (1780‚Äì1839) was a Sikh ruler of the sovereign country of Punjab and the Sikh Empire. His Samadhi is located in Lahore, Pakistan. He then spent the following years fighting the Afghans, driving them out of western Punjab, taking opportunity of the Afghans being embroiled in civil war. The deposed Afghan king Shah Shuja rallied a significant number of tribes and received British backing in the form of the Sikh army against the Barakzai king Dost Muhammad. The civil war in Afghanistan coupled with a British backed assault meant that the Sikhs could virtually walk into Peshawar. They managed to capture Pashtun territory including Peshawar which was under direct British supervision and control. =British East India Company= Hill Tribes men sniping a British Force At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the East India Company controlled southern India, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa (modern Odisha). Dominance was gained at the expense of its French equivalent, the Compagnie des Indes. Britain and France were at war, and the Franco-Persian alliance of 1807, followed the same year by the Franco-Russian Treaty of Tilsit, alerted the HEIC to the external threat posed from the north- west.Barthorp 2002, p. 19 By 1819 only Sindh and the Sikh Empire remained outside the company's control. Napoleon was vanquished, but the Empire of the Tsars had begun to expand south and east. Russian influence grew likewise, and by the early 1830s Qajar IrƒÅn was within the Tsar's sphere. Attempts by IrƒÅn to recover Herat in 1834, and again in 1837, raised the spectre of Russian armies on the road to Kandahar, whence direct access to India through the Khojak and Bolan passes.Barthorp 2002, p. 29 Meanwhile, the conflict between Afghanistan and the Punjab focused on the Khyber route. Dost Mohammad appealed to the HEIC for aid in recovering Peshawar, but the company could not help him without alienating its treaty ally Ranjit Singh. When Dost Mohammad redirected his appeal to Russia, the Governor-General Lord Auckland resolved to depose Dost Mohammad, and replace him with Shuja Shah Durrani. Restored to his throne in Kabul, the exiled former ruler would accept the Sikh gains west of the Indus, and the Company controlling his foreign policy. The agreement was formalised with the Treaty of Simla signed in June 1838 between Shah Shuja, the HEIC, and Ranjit Singh.Barthorp 2002, pp. 30-31 =British Indian Empire= Chronology =1800‚Äì1837 (Afghan-Sikh Wars)= *Battle of Attock (1813) *Battle of Multan (1818) *Battle of Shopian (1819) *Battle of Nowshera (1823) *Battle of Jamrud (1837) =1838‚Äì48 (First Afghan War to Second Sikh War)= *First Anglo-Afghan War (1838‚Äì1842) *Sindh Campaign (1843) *First Anglo-Sikh War (1845‚Äì46) *Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848‚Äì49) =1849‚Äì58 (Second Sikh War to Sepoy Revolt)= In the period following the annexation of the Punjab in 1849 until the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, several expeditions were undertaken against almost every tribe along the whole of the North-West Frontier, most notably under Sir Charles Napier and Sir Colin Campbell, under orders from the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie. Disgusted at being instructed to burn Pathan villages, first Napier and then Campbell resigned and returned to England. Campbell had already decided that the best method of dealing with the tribesmen on the frontier was through bribery.Greenwood, ch.6 When the Sepoy Rebellion broke out Amir Dost Mohammad Khan came under internal pressure to seize the advantage and attack India. However he stood by his treaty obligations. This allowed Indian troops on the frontier to deploy to Delhi and deal with the revolt centered there. *Operations against the Baizai (1849) *Operations in the Kohat Pass (1850) *Mohmand Expeditions (1851‚Äì2) *Ranizai Expedition (1852) *First Black Mountain Expedition (1852) *Shirani Expedition (1853) *Afridi Expedition (1853) *Aka Khel Expedition (1854) *Operations against the Orakzais (1855) *Miranzai Valley Expeditions (1855‚Äì6) *Bozdar Expedition (1857) *Expedition against the Hindustani Fanatics (1857-8).Also known as the Sittana Expeditions. *Sepoy Rebellion (1857‚Äì8) (Indian Mutiny) =1859‚Äì1878 (Sepoy Revolt to Second Afghan War)= *Kabul Khel Expedition (1859) *Mahsud Expedition (1860) *Umbeyla Campaign (1863) *Operations at Shabkadar (1863‚Äì4) *Second Black Mountain Expedition (1868) *Bazotee Expedition (1868) *Operations in the Tochi Valley (1872) *Jowaki Expedition (1877‚Äì8) *Operations against the Utman Khel (1878) =1878‚Äì1898 (Second Afghan War to Frontier Rebellion)= In 1877, Amir Sher Ali received a Russian mission in Kabul, but refused to accept one from India. The following year Sher Ali signed a treaty with Russia. India sent a mission anyway, but the mission and its armed escort were denied passage through the Khyber Pass. India threatened to invade, and when no apology was forthcoming, did so. Sher Ali died while fleeing to Russian territory, and his son Yakub succeeded him. On May 26, 1879, Amir Yakub signed the Treaty of Gandamak, whereby Afghanistan surrendered its foreign policy to India, which in turn promised protection from aggression. Afghanistan ceded some territory and accepted a British Resident in Kabul.Wilkinson-Latham, p. 14-15 In September 1879, some six weeks after establishing his residency, Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort were murdered. Hostilities promptly resumed. Yakub's army was defeated in September 1880, and his throne was offered to, and accepted by, Abdur Rahman, who agreed to surrender all claims on the Khyber, the Kurram, Sibi, and Pishin.The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 11 *Second Afghan War (1878‚Äì1880) *Zakka Khel Expeditions (1878‚Äì9) *Operations against the Mohmands (1878‚Äì80)Includes the Expedition to Kam Dakka. *Operations against the Zaimukht (1878‚Äì9) *Operations against the Marris (1880) *Mahsud-Waziri Expedition (1881) *Expedition to the Takht-i-Suliman (1883) *Third Black Mountain Expedition (1888) *Operations in the Zhob Valley (1890‚Äì1) *Fourth Black Mountain Expedition (1891) *Miranzai Expeditions (1891) *Hunza-Nagar Expedition (1891) *Mahsud Expedition (1894‚Äì5) *Chitral expedition (1895) *Tochi Valley Expedition (1897) *Siege of Malakand (1897) *Operations of the Buner Field Force (1897-1898)Includes the action at Laudakai and the capture of the Tanga Pass *Tirah Campaign (1897) *First Mohmand campaign (1897-1898) =1898‚Äì1914 (Frontier Revolt to Great War)= *Mahsud Waziri blockade (1900‚Äì1902) *Kabul Khel Expedition (1902) *Bazar Valley campaign (1908) *Mohmand Expedition of 1908 =1914‚Äì1918 (First World War)= Madras Regiment War Memorial, Bangalore, mentions lives lost in the North West Frontier by the Madras Sappers In support of the British war effort, the Indian Army deployed expeditionary forces to the Western Front, East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, Sinai and Palestine.Sumner, p. 6 India was thus vulnerable to hostile attention from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915 with obvious strategic purpose. However, Amir Habibulla abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, in the face of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Hostilities on the frontier remained local. * Operations in the Tochi (1914‚Äì15) * Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915) * Kalat Operations (1915-16)Baluchistan * Mohmand Blockade (1916‚Äì17) * Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) * Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918)Report of the Battles Nomenclature Committee =1919‚Äì39 (between the wars)= Having upheld Afghan neutrality while India was engaged in the Great War, Habibulla sought full independence for Afghanistan in February 1919.Robson, Crisis on the Frontier p. 8 Such a reward might have consolidated his rule, but later that month he was murdered.Robson, Crisis on the Frontier p. 9 His successor Amanullah pursued a similar policy by different means. With India's Army de-mobilising, and its Government preoccupied with violent unrest in western India, Amanullah sent his troops across the Frontier in early May. At the end of the month he sought an armistice, which was granted on June 3.The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account, p. 50 By the Treaty of Rawalpindi signed in August, Afghanistan gained control of its foreign affairs, and in turn, recognised the Durand Line as its border with India.Robson, Crisis on the Frontier pp. 136‚Äì7 The short- lived war had long-term consequences in Waziristan, where tribesmen rallied to Amanullah's cause. The western militia posts were abandoned. Many of the militia deserted, taking their modern weapons and joining their fellow tribesmen in attacking the remaining posts. As a result, the Indian Army's Waziristan Force was fully engaged in re-establishing the posts and restoring the lines of communication from November until May 1920. The western base at Wana was finally reoccupied in December 1920.Official History of Operations on the N. W. Frontier of India 1920-35, p.7 The long-term plan for control of the district entailed building metalled roads along the lines of communication to a new central base to be established at Razmak. In 1921 work began on the southern road up the Tank Zam from Jandola, under the protection of the Waziristan Force. The following year work on the northern road from the Tochi began at Idak, shielded by the Razmak Force advancing to its objective. The two roads met in 1924, linking North and South Waziristan, and enabling the Indian Army to reorganise both areas as one military district.Official History of Operations on the N. W. Frontier of India 1920-35 pp. 29 & 31 The Waziristan and Razmak Field Forces then devolved into brigades based permanently at Manzai, Razmak, Gardai, and Bannu.Official History of Operations on the N.

There were, however, brief periods of troubleIndeed in 1940, Pathan tribesmen launched a big attack on the 1/6 GR who were stationed in Waziristan at the time, although there were no casualties. See Cross & Buddhiman 2002, p. 114. on the frontier, which required the British to continue to maintain a military presence in the region, although for the main they were able to employ mainly garrison or rear-area troops during this time, thus allowing them to free up front-line units for active service elsewhere. > Trained regular troops were desperately needed for the war against Germany > and Japan. Razmak, Wana and Bannu were garrisoned with half-trained units > which suffered serious reverses, losing men, rifles, and light machine- > guns.Chenevix Trench, p.241 In 1944, a British committee under Lieutenant-General Sir Francis Tuker was set up to review future policy for the region.Barthorp 2002, pp. 176‚Äì177. As part of its findings, it recommended a return to the Curzon Plan, which advocated the withdrawal of all regular forces from tribal territory into outposts, or cantonments, along the administrative border from where they could keep an eye on things. The unadministered districts would then once again become the responsibility of the local militias. =Withdrawal= In 1947, following the independence, the North-West Frontier region became a part of the newly formed nation of Pakistan.Cheema 2002, p. 53. Based upon the recommendations of the Tucker committee in 1944 (see above), the newly formed Pakistani government decided to move away from the previous British policy of 'forward defence' in the North-West Frontier region and ordered the withdrawal of forces from Waziristan, as it was felt that the presence of a regular military force in the region was provoking tensions with the local tribesmen. This withdrawal began on December 6, 1947 and was successfully completed by the end of the month under the codename Operation Curzon. Treatment of prisoners-of-war According to the British officer John Masters, Pathan women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901‚Äì1955) of British India during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would castrate non-Muslim soldiers who were captured, especially British and Sikhs. Pathan women urinated into prisoners' mouths. A method of execution by this is recorded: captured British soldiers were spread out and fastened with restraints to the ground, then a stick, or a piece of wood was used to keep their mouth open to prevent swallowing. Pathan women then squatted and urinated directly into the mouth of the man until he drowned in the urine, taking turns one at a time. This method of execution was reported to have been practiced specifically by the women of the Afridi tribe of the Pashtuns. Military formations =Corps of Guides= Corps of cavalry and infantry, raised at Peshawar in 1846 by Lt. Harry Lumsden, and later based at Hoti Mardan.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 964 Originally one troop of cavalry and two companies of infantry,Jackson, p. 85 the cavalry component later expanded to 2¬Ω squadrons, and the infantry to 4¬Ω companies. Two further infantry battalions were raised in 1917.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, pp. 968 & 970 From its inception the corps was clothed in native style, with smock, baggy trousers and turban of home-spun cotton, and jerkin of sheepskin. The cotton was dyed grey with a derivative of a dwarf palm known as mazari, while the leather was dyed khaki with mulberry juice. Thus was military dress first coloured khaki for its camouflage effect, and the Guides were the first troops to wear it.Jackson p. 537 The drab colour is well suited to the barren rocky terrain of the North-West Frontier, and all but one of the other Punjab frontier units soon followed the Guides example.Jackson, p. 538 In 1848 the Second Sikh War broke out and the corps won its first battle honours; 'MOOLTAN', 'GOOJERAT', and 'PUNJAUB'. Thereafter the Guides were engaged in most frontier affairs, and from 1857 the corps was included in the Punjab Irregular Force, and subsequently in the Punjab Frontier Force. That same year the Corps of Guides was ordered to Delhi, covering the 930 km from Mardan in twenty-two days and famously going into action on arrival.Gaylor, p. 171 They were duly honoured with DELHI 1857. At the beginning of the Second Afghan War in 1878, the Guides Infantry, together with the 1st Sikh Infantry, PFF, took part in forcing the Khyber, and were prominent in seizing the fortress of Ali Masjid.Jackson, p. 90 For this and subsequent efforts the Corps of Guides was awarded the battle honours ALI MASJID, KABUL 1879, and AFGHANISTAN 1878‚Äì80. The last decade of the 19th century saw the Guides employed in the Chitral campaign of 1895, and the Punjab Frontier Revolt of 1897‚Äì8. Thus was the corps awarded the battle honours 'CHITRAL', 'MALAKAND', and 'PUNJAB FRONTIER'. The reforms of 1903 gave to the Queen's Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden's) a subsidiary title in the form of its founders name, but left it numberless. In 1911 the corps took up Frontier Force as its first subsidiary title. During the First World War the cavalry branch of the Corps was deployed overseas to Mesopotamia, but not before winning a further honour in its own territory; 'N.W. FRONTIER INDIA 1915'. In 1922 the separation became permanent, when the mounted branch was redesignated the 10th Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force),Jackson, pp. 542‚Äì543 and the infantry was amalgamated as the 5th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment (Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides).Jackson, pp. 556‚Äì557 =Sind Frontier Force= Formed in 1846 to guard the southern part of the North-West Frontier. Initially consisting of just the Scinde Irregular Horse, the force under Capt. John Jacob was part of the Bombay Army.Heathcote, p.27 Cavalry The Scinde Irregular Horse was raised at Hyderabad in 1839 by Capt. Ward.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 941 The regiment earned its first battle honour during the Operations in Scinde 1839-42, when it was awarded the unique distinction 'CUTCHEE'.Roger, p.53 For the subsequent Scinde Campaign of 1843 it was awarded 'MEEANEE' and 'HYDERABAD'.Roger, p. 48-49 A second regiment was raised at Hyderabad in 1846 by Capt. J. Jacob.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 943 During the Second Sikh War both the 1st and 2nd Irregular Horse earned further distinction with 'MOOLTAN', 'GOOJERAT', and 'PUNJAUB'.Roger, p.51-52 A third regiment was raised in 1857,Gaylor, p.89 and in 1860 the regiments were designated simply Scinde Horse. The 1st Scinde Horse was deployed to suppress the Sepoy Revolt of 1857‚Äì8, and was duly awarded CENTRAL INDIA.Roger, p. 56 All three regiments were rewarded for their part in the Second Afghan War:- * 1st Scinde Horse; AFGHANISTAN 1878-79 * 2nd Scinde Horse; AFGHANISTAN 1879-80 * 3rd Scinde Horse; KANDAHAR 1880, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80Roger, p.48-58 Its hard- won honours notwithstanding, the third regiment was disbanded in 1882. The 1st and 2nd Regiments joined the Bombay line in 1885 as the 5th and 6th Bombay Cavalry respectively. In the reformed Indian Army in 1903 they were likewise redesignated 35th Scinde Horse and 36th Jacob's Horse. Infantry Jacob's Rifles, raised in 1858 by Maj. John Jacob.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 1517 In 1861 the rifles joined the Bombay line as the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The regiment was honoured for its part in the Second Afghan War with AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 Designated 130th Baluchis in 1903, the subsidiary title was restored in 1910. Artillery The force was augmented with No. 2 Coy. Bombay Native Artillery in 1875, when that company relieved the men of Jacob's Rfles manning the guns of the force headquarters at Jacobabad.Jackson p.178 Converted to a mountain battery the following year, the company was accordingly redesignated No. 2 Bombay Mountain Battery.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 975 For its part in the Second Afghan War the battery was awarded the honour AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 Later re-numbered as No. 6 (Bombay) Mountain Battery, and then briefly renamed the Jullundur Mountain Battery, the unit took its place in the reformed Indian Army of 1903 as 26th Jacob's Mountain Battery. =Frontier Brigade= Created in 1846 to police the newly acquired Punjab border against the Pakhtun hill tribes.Robson, The Road to Kabul, p. 59 The brigade was formed by Lt. Col. Henry Montgomery Lawrence from four regiments of infantry raised in 1846 from veterans of the Sikh forces disbanded after the First Anglo-Sikh War:- * 1st Regiment, raised at Hoshiarpur by Capt.

The units of the force came to be known collectively from its initials as Piffers. Cavalry The Punjab Cavalry regiments were redesignated Cavalry, Punjab Irregular Force.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, pp.915-921 While the 3rd and 4th regiments remained on the frontier,Jackson, p.96Jackson, p. 102 the 1st, 2nd, and 5th were employed in suppressing the Sepoy Revolt, and later rewarded with the battle honours DELHI 1857, and LUCKNOW.Roger, p. 55 Artillery Batteries were raised from various sources:- * No. 1 Horse Light Field Battery, PIF * No. 2 Horse Light Field Battery, PIF, raised at Bannu in 1851 by Lt.

Later the force gained two further batteries:- * Hazara Mountain Train Battery, PIF, in 1856. (Formed at Haripur in 1851, by Lt. G. G. Pearse.)Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 974 * Peshawar Mountain Train Battery, PIF, in 1862. (Formed at Peshawar in 1853 by Capt. T. Brougham.) Infantry In 1857 the four regiments of Sikh Local Infantry became Sikh Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, pp. 1227-9 The six Punjab Infantry regiments were simply redesignated Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, pp. 1243-59 The 4th Regiment of Sikh Infantry served in the Second Burma War, winning the honour PEGU, and then marched 900 km from Abbottabad in thirty days to help suppress the revolt in Delhi, and like the Guides going into action on arrival. There it won also DELHI 1857. The other Sikh Infantry regiments remained in the Punjab.Jackson, p. 313 Leaving the 3rd, 5th, & 6th Punjab Infantry Regiments to guard the frontier, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th were sent to put down the revolt in Delhi.Jackson, p. 325 There they earned the honour DELHI 1857\\\\. The 2nd and 4th regiments were also rewarded with LUCKNOW. From 1861 the force included a 7th Infantry Regiment, formed from the Hazara Gurkha Battalion, which later that year joined the Gurkha Line as the 5th Gurkha Regiment.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919, p. 1617 =Punjab Frontier Force= In 1865 the Punjab Irregular Force was renamed the Punjab Frontier Force, and the constituent units were redesignated accordingly. During peacetime the Force was under the direct control of the Lt.-Governor of the Punjab,The Punjab then included what later became the North-West Frontier Province but in war it came under the Commander-in-Chief, India. After the three Presidency armies, it was the most important military force at the Governor-General's disposal. Deployed and engaged in numerous border expeditions, it became the most experienced body of fighting troops in India. Most of the force saw action during the Second Afghan War. The designation Punjab Frontier Force was dropped in 1901, but with the Kitchener Reforms of the British Indian Army two years later, the former distinction was restored to the newly re-numbered regiments in the form of the subsidiary title Frontier Force. Cavalry Officially designated Cavalry, Punjab Frontier Force, the earlier style endured, and was restored in 1901. Four of the regiments were honoured for service in the Second Afghan War:- *1st Punjab Cavalry; AHMED KHEL, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *2nd Punjab Cavalry; AHMED KHEL, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *3rd Punjab Cavalry; KANDAHAR 1880, AFGHANISTAN 1879-80 *5th Punjab Cavalry; CHARASIA, KABUL 1879, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80Roger, p. 57-59 The 4th regiment served on the frontier before being disbanded in 1882.Gaylor, p. 84 In 1903 the four remaining regiments were brought into the new Indian Army line by adding twenty to their original numbers:- * 21st Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) (Daly's Horse) * 22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force) * 23rd Cavalry (Frontier Force) * 25th Cavalry (Frontier Force) Artillery The two mountain trains were redesignated mountain batteries in 1865. In 1876 the three Punjab Light Field Batteries were reduced to form two further mountain batteries, and the four were then renumbered according to their relative precedence, and designated Punjab Mountain Batteries, Punjab Frontier Force.Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919 pp. 972-4 The former Garrison Company was also renumbered in the same sequence to become the No. 5 Garrison Battery, Punjab Frontier Force. All four mountain batteries were honoured for their part in the Second Afghan War:- *No. 1 (Kohat) Punjab Mountain Battery; PEIWAR KOTAL, KABUL 1879, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *No. 2 (Derajat) Punjab Mountain Battery; CHARASIA, KABUL 1879, KANDAHAR 1880, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *No. 3 (Peshawar) Punjab Mountain Battery; AFGHANISTAN 1878-79 *No. 4 (Hazara) Punjab Mountain Battery; ALI MASJID, KABUL 1879, AFGHANISTAN 1879-80 In 1895 the Derajat and Hazara Mountain Batteries were part of the relief expedition that was rewarded with the honour CHITRAL.Roger, p. 63 The Frontier Revolt of 1897-8 saw the Kohat and Derajat batteries in action again, earning the honours TIRAH and PUNJAB FRONTIER.Roger p. 64-5 In 1901 the battery numbers were dropped, and they became known by name only.Gaylor p. 107 Two years later the four mountain batteries were re- numbered from twenty-one, and the former Piffer batteries were thus:- * 21st Kohat Mountain Battery (Frontier Force) * 22nd Derajat Mountain Battery (Frontier Force) * 23rd Peshawar Mountain Battery (Frontier Force) * 24th Hazara Mountain Battery (Frontier Force) * The Frontier Garrison Artillery Infantry The four Sikh regiments were simply redesignated Sikh Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force. The six former Punjab Infantry regiments were officially redesignated Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force, but the earlier style lingered and was restored in 1901. Although never designated as such, the 5th Gurkha Regiment was brigaded with the force in practice. All but two of the infantry regiments took the field in the Second Afghan War, and their subsequent awards were:- *1st Sikh Infantry; ALI MASJID, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *2nd Sikh Infantry; AMED KHEL, KANDAHAR 1880, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *3rd Sikh Infantry; KABUL 1879, KANDAHAR 1880, AFGHANISTAN 1879-80 *1st Punjab Infantry; AFGHANISTAN 1878-79 *2nd Punjab Infantry; PEIWAR KOTAL, AFGHANISTAN 1878-79 *4th Punjab Infantry; AFGHANISTAN 1879-80 *5th Punjab Infantry; PEIWAR KOTAL, CHARASIA, KABUL 1879, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 *5th Gurkha Regiment; PEIWAR KOTAL, CHARASIA, KABUL 1879, AFGHANISTAN 1878-80 Spending cuts after the war resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Punjab Infantry in 1882.Gaylor, p.175 Spared the same fate, the 4th Sikh Infantry was employed in the expedition of 1895 earning the honour CHITRAL. The Frontier Revolt of 1897-8 saw the 3rd Sikh and 2nd Punjab Infantries employed in the Tirah Campaign, earning them the honors TIRAH and PUNJAB FRONTIER. The 5th Gurkha Rifles was also awarded PUNJAB FRONTIER. In 1903 the four Sikh Infantry regiments were brought into the new Indian Army Line by adding fifty to their original numbers:- * 51st Sikhs (Frontier Force) * 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force) * 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force) * 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force) The five remaining regiments of Punjab Infantry were consecutively renumbered in the same sequence to become:- * 55th Coke's Rifles (Frontier Force) * 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) * 57th Wilde's Rifles (Frontier Force) * 58th Vaughan's Rifles (Frontier Force) * 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force) The 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force) took on the subsidiary title denoting their origin. =Frontier Corps= Although the units of the Frontier Corps operated under a variety of titles, from Rifles to Militia to Scouts, it was the latter term that came to stand as the generic term, and as new units were formed, it was the word 'Scouts' that became fixed and formalised for the regimental titles. The expression 'Scouts' was a militarily neutral term, conveying neither the \\"crack\\" reputation associated with the word 'Rifles' (cf.: 60th Rifles [HM], Gurkha Rifles [IA], etc.), nor the rather second-rate expectations of the term 'Militia'. As General Baden- Powell noted, when he was looking, many years later, for a suitably inspiring term to adopt for his youth movement to train young boys in fieldcraft and other 'para-military' activities, the word Scouts encapsulated a spirit of 'dash' (enthusiasm), expertise - within a defined set of skills- and familiarity with both the local conditions. Similarly, the Scouts of the Frontier Corps understood both the local terrain and the local political minefields, that is, who could be trusted (e.g. the Turi), and who could never (almost invariably, this would mean the Mahsuds); who was currently nursing a grievance and therefore best avoided, and who had just had a claim settled to their satisfaction and might be uncharacteristically friendly. Like many things British, the development of the units of Scouts into the Frontier Corps was organic, unplanned and initially unsystematic. It began, in the British manner, as an improvisation to meet a need; it was maintained because it guaranteed certain unique skills at an acceptable price (the great Empire may have vaunted its 'pomp and circumstance' to wow the impressionable, but behind the scenes the deciding factor was often simply the acceptability or otherwise to HM Treasury) and only then was the principle regularised, standardised and systemised (cf. the development of the Frontier Force, from irregulars to a corps d'elite).

The title is taken from the classic human anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, originally written by Henry Gray in 1858. It was shot in ten days in late January 1996 during a break Soderbergh had from post-production on his previous film, Schizopolis. The monologist film is about Spalding Gray, the main character, who is diagnosed with a rare ocular condition called macular pucker. After hearing all of his options, such as Christian Science, Native American sweat lodges, and the \\"Elvis Presley of psychic surgeons\\", and the dangers of what surgery could bring, he decides to go through the other forms of medicine provided. This in turn takes him on a journey around the world and steers him away from surgery more so because of religious reasons, often in a dramatic and humorous fashion. This was the fourth and last of Gray's theatrically released monologue films, following Swimming to Cambodia, Monster in a Box, and Terrors of Pleasure. The film is available on DVD and MiniDisc. A remastered version was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2012.\\"Gray's Anatomy (1997) ‚Äì The Criterion Collection\\". Retrieved 2012-3-17. Cast Spalding Gray was raised in Rhode Island and attended school in Massachusetts. Gray's style as an actor was influenced by Allen Ginsberg, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, and the American Autobiographical movement. He mostly worked in experimental theater. In 1977, he co-founded the Wooster Theater Group in New York City. Two years later he performed his first monologue: Sex and Death at the Age of 14. In the '80s Gray traveled to Thailand where he won two Independent Spirit Awards for the film Swimming to Cambodia. He appeared in several independent films in the '90s before Gray's Anatomy was published. Critical reception Janet Maslin of the New York Times gave a positive review, calling it \\"A chatty, colorful, nicely sardonic account of how a crisis led Mr. Gray to assess his medical state, consider his mortality and take one more funny, self-dramatizing look at the eccentric world around him.\\" Desson Thomson of the Washington Post also reviewed the film positively, stating \\"Gray's Anatomy finds Spalding Gray turning a bout with a bizarre ocular condition into a dizzying, absorbing odyssey of the neurotic mind.\\" The Digital Fix described Gray's Anatomy as \\"very witty and a pleasure to listen to. As he passes fifty, Gray starts to worry about his own death before he finds the sight in his left eye is becoming distorted. Learning that he has a macular pucker, Gray seeks out alternative therapies, including mass nude encounters in a sweatbox, a raw-vegetable diet and a trip to the Philippines to meet a psychic surgeon.\\" On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicle described Gray's Anatomy as an unremarkable story. \\"There's something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. This creeping sense that Gray isn't really interested in anything he's talking about ‚Äì that he, alone, is the subject of his own obsession gives Gray's Anatomy a distasteful edge.\\" The Chicago Tribune described Gray's Anatomy as \\"demonstrating that fully stimulating the senses isn't the same as fully engaging them. The film begins as ordinary as could be and then continues with scenery changes, lighting effects, and moody music.\\" References External links * *Gray‚Äôs Anatomy: The Eyes of the Beholder an essay by Amy Taubin at the Criterion Collection Category:1996 films Category:Films directed by Steven Soderbergh Category:Human eyes in culture Category:One-character films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1996 comedy films Category:Films scored by Cliff Martinez ","title":"Gray's Anatomy (film)"},{"id":"1248640","text":"Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova (born 1937) was head of the Salvadoran national guard between the years 1979 and 1983 and later served as the nation's Minister of Defense between 1983 and 1989. In 1984, four national guardsmen who had once served under Vides Casanova's command-Daniel Canales Ramirez, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos and Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura‚Äîwere convicted of murdering of the churchwomen and were sentenced to 30 years in prison. Their superior, sub-sergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman, was also convicted for the murders as well. In 1998, the four assassins confessed to abducting, raping and murdering the four churchwomen and claimed that they did so because Aleman had informed them that they had to act on orders from high-level military officers. Some were then released from prison after detailing how Vides and his cousin Col. Oscar Edgardo Casanova Vejar, the local military commander in Zacatecoluca, had planned and orchestrated the executions of the churchwomen. A 16-year legal battle to deport General Vides Casanova soon commenced. Emigration to the United States Following his retirement, General Vides left El Salvador and moved to Florida in 1989 as a legal permanent resident and had been living in Palm Coast.

The relative homology is useful and important in several ways. Intuitively, it helps determine what part of an absolute homology group comes from which subspace.  Definition  Given a subspace A\\\\subset X, one may form the short exact sequence :0\\\\to C_\\\\bullet(A) \\\\to C_\\\\bullet(X)\\\\to C_\\\\bullet(X) /C_\\\\bullet(A) \\\\to 0, where C_\\\\bullet(X) denotes the singular chains on the space X. The boundary map on C_\\\\bullet(X) leaves C_\\\\bullet(A) invarianti.e., the boundary \\\\partial\\\\colon C_n(X)\\\\to C_{n-1}(X) maps C_n(A) to C_{n-1}(A) and therefore descends to a boundary map \\\\partial'_\\\\bullet on the quotient. If we denote this quotient by C_n(X,A):=C_n(X)/C_n(A), we then have a complex :\\\\cdots\\\\longrightarrow C_n(X,A)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\partial'_n} C_{n-1}(X,A)\\\\longrightarrow\\\\cdots. By definition, the th relative homology group of the pair of spaces (X,A) is :H_n(X,A) := \\\\ker\\\\partial'_n/\\\\operatorname{im}\\\\partial'_{n+1}. One says that relative homology is given by the relative cycles, chains whose boundaries are chains on A, modulo the relative boundaries (chains that are homologous to a chain on A, i.e., chains that would be boundaries, modulo A again). Properties The above short exact sequences specifying the relative chain groups gives rise to a chain complex of short exact sequences. An application of the snake lemma then yields a long exact sequence :\\\\cdots \\\\to H_n(A) \\\\stackrel{i_*}{\\\\to} H_n(X) \\\\stackrel{j_*}{\\\\to} H_n (X,A) \\\\stackrel{\\\\partial}{\\\\to} H_{n-1}(A) \\\\to \\\\cdots . The connecting map \\\\partial takes a relative cycle, representing a homology class in H_n(X,A), to its boundary (which is a cycle in A). It follows that H_n(X,x_0), where x_0 is a point in X, is the n-th reduced homology group of X. In other words, H_i(X,x_0) = H_i(X) for all i > 0. When i = 0, H_0(X,x_0) is the free module of one rank less than H_0(X). The connected component containing x_0 becomes trivial in relative homology. The excision theorem says that removing a sufficiently nice subset Z \\\\subset A leaves the relative homology groups H_n(X,A) unchanged. Using the long exact sequence of pairs and the excision theorem, one can show that H_n(X,A) is the same as the n-th reduced homology groups of the quotient space X/A. Relative homology readily extends to the triple (X,Y,Z) for Z \\\\subset Y \\\\subset X. One can define the Euler characteristic for a pair Y \\\\subset X by :\\\\chi (X, Y) = \\\\sum _{j=0} ^n (-1)^j \\\\operatorname{rank} H_j (X, Y) . The exactness of the sequence implies that the Euler characteristic is additive, i.e., if Z \\\\subset Y \\\\subset X, one has : \\\\chi (X, Z) = \\\\chi (X, Y) + \\\\chi (Y, Z).  Local homology  The n-th local homology group of a space X at a point x_0, denoted :H_{n,\\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\}}(X) is defined to be the relative homology group H_n(X,X\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\}). Informally, this is the \\"local\\" homology of X close to x_0. = Local homology of the cone CX at the origin = One easy example of local homology is calculating the local homology of the cone (topology) of a space at the origin of the cone. Recall that the cone is defined as the quotient space :CX = (X\\\\times I)/(X\\\\times\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}), where X \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} has the subspace topology. Then, the origin x_0 = 0 is the equivalence class of points [X\\\\times 0]. Using the intuition that the local homology group H_{*,\\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\}}(CX) of CX at x_0 captures the homology of CX \\"near\\" the origin, we should expect this is the homology of H_*(X) since CX \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} has a homotopy retract to X. Computing the local cohomology can then be done using the long exact sequence in homology :\\\\begin{align} \\\\to &H;_n(CX\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x_0 \\\\\\\\})\\\\to H_n(CX) \\\\to H_{n,\\\\\\\\{x_{0}\\\\\\\\}}(CX)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\to & H_{n-1}(CX\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x_0 \\\\\\\\})\\\\to H_{n-1}(CX) \\\\to H_{n-1,\\\\\\\\{x_{0}\\\\\\\\}}(CX) \\\\end{align}. Because the cone of a space is contractible, the middle homology groups are all zero, giving the isomorphism :\\\\begin{align} H_{n,\\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\}}(CX) & \\\\cong H_{n-1}(CX \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{ x_0 \\\\\\\\}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\cong H_{n-1}(X) \\\\end{align}, since CX \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x_0\\\\\\\\} is contractible to X.  In algebraic geometry  Note the previous construction can be proven in Algebraic geometry using the affine cone of a projective variety X using Local cohomology. = Local homology of a point on a smooth manifold = Another computation for local homology can be computed on a point p of a manifold M. Then, let K be a compact neighborhood of p isomorphic to a closed disk \\\\mathbb{D}^n = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\R^n : x \\\\leq 1 \\\\\\\\} and let U = M \\\\setminus K. Using the excision theorem there is an isomorphism of relative homology groups :\\\\begin{align} H_n(M,M\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}) &\\\\cong H_n(M\\\\setminus U, M\\\\setminus (U\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\})) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= H_n(K, K\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}) \\\\end{align}, hence the local homology of a point reduces to the local homology of a point in a closed ball \\\\mathbb{D}^n. Because of the homotopy equivalence :\\\\mathbb{D}^n \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\simeq S^{n-1} and the fact :H_k(\\\\mathbb{D}^n) \\\\cong \\\\begin{cases} \\\\Z & k = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & k eq 0 \\\\end{cases}, the only non- trivial part of the long exact sequence of the pair (\\\\mathbb{D},\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}) is :0 \\\\to H_{n,\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}(\\\\mathbb{D}^n) \\\\to H_{n-1}(S^{n-1}) \\\\to 0, hence the only non-zero local homology group is H_{n,\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}(\\\\mathbb{D}^n). Functoriality Just as in absolute homology, continuous maps between spaces induce homomorphisms between relative homology groups. In fact, this map is exactly the induced map on homology groups, but it descends to the quotient. Let (X,A) and (Y,B) be pairs of spaces such that A\\\\subseteq X and B\\\\subseteq Y, and let f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y be a continuous map. Then there is an induced map f_\\\\\\\\#\\\\colon C_n(X)\\\\to C_n(Y) on the (absolute) chain groups. If f(A)\\\\subseteq B, then f_\\\\\\\\#(C_n(A))\\\\subseteq C_n(B). Let \\\\begin{align} \\\\pi_X&:C_n(X)\\\\longrightarrow C_n(X)/C_n(A) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi_Y&:C_n(Y)\\\\longrightarrow C_n(Y)/C_n(B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} be the natural projections which take elements to their equivalence classes in the quotient groups. Then the map \\\\pi_Y\\\\circ f_\\\\\\\\#\\\\colon C_n(X)\\\\to C_n(Y)/C_n(B) is a group homomorphism. Since f_\\\\\\\\#(C_n(A))\\\\subseteq C_n(B)=\\\\ker\\\\pi_Y, this map descends to the quotient, inducing a well-defined map \\\\varphi\\\\colon C_n(X)/C_n(A)\\\\to C_n(Y)/C_n(B) such that the following diagram commutes: 300x300px. Chain maps induce homomorphisms between homology groups, so f induces a map f_*\\\\colon H_n(X,A)\\\\to H_n(Y,B) on the relative homology groups. Examples One important use of relative homology is the computation of the homology groups of quotient spaces X/A. In the case that A is a subspace of X fulfilling the mild regularity condition that there exists a neighborhood of A that has A as a deformation retract, then the group \\\\tilde H_n(X/A) is isomorphic to H_n(X,A). We can immediately use this fact to compute the homology of a sphere. We can realize S^n as the quotient of an n-disk by its boundary, i.e. S^n = D^n/S^{n-1}. Applying the exact sequence of relative homology gives the following: \\\\cdots\\\\to \\\\tilde H_n(D^n)\\\\rightarrow H_n(D^n,S^{n-1})\\\\rightarrow \\\\tilde H_{n-1}(S^{n-1})\\\\rightarrow \\\\tilde H_{n-1}(D^n)\\\\to \\\\cdots. Because the disk is contractible, we know its reduced homology groups vanish in all dimensions, so the above sequence collapses to the short exact sequence: 0\\\\rightarrow H_n(D^n,S^{n-1}) \\\\rightarrow \\\\tilde H_{n-1}(S^{n-1}) \\\\rightarrow 0. Therefore, we get isomorphisms H_n(D^n,S^{n-1})\\\\cong \\\\tilde H_{n-1}(S^{n-1}). We can now proceed by induction to show that H_n(D^n,S^{n-1})\\\\cong \\\\Z. Now because S^{n-1} is the deformation retract of a suitable neighborhood of itself in D^n, we get that H_n(D^n,S^{n-1})\\\\cong \\\\tilde H_n(S^n)\\\\cong \\\\Z. Another insightful geometric example is given by the relative homology of (X=\\\\Complex^*, D = \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}) where \\\\alpha eq 0, 1. Then we can use the long exact sequence : \\\\begin{align} 0 &\\\\to H_1(D)\\\\to H_1(X) \\\\to H_1(X,D) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\to H_0(D)\\\\to H_0(X) \\\\to H_0(X,D) \\\\end{align} = \\\\begin{align} 0 & \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\Z \\\\to H_1(X,D) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\to \\\\Z^{\\\\oplus 2} \\\\to \\\\Z \\\\to 0 \\\\end{align} Using exactness of the sequence we can see that H_1(X,D) contains a loop \\\\sigma counterclockwise around the origin. Since the cokernel of \\\\phi\\\\colon \\\\Z \\\\to H_1(X,D) fits into the exact sequence : 0 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{coker}(\\\\phi) \\\\to \\\\Z^{\\\\oplus 2} \\\\to \\\\Z \\\\to 0 it must be isomorphic to \\\\Z. One generator for the cokernel is the 1-chain [1,\\\\alpha] since its boundary map is :\\\\partial([1,\\\\alpha]) = [\\\\alpha] - [1] See also *Excision Theorem *Mayer‚ÄìVietoris sequence References Joseph J.

Biography Herbert Williams was born in Hooton, Cheshire, on 2 December 1884. He was educated at Liverpool University with degrees in science and engineering. In 1911 he became secretary and manager of the Machine Tools Trade Association. He served on Wimbledon Borough Council. Williams contested the Combined English Universities in 1918 and Wednesbury in 1922 and 1923 without success. From 1924 to 1929, Williams was MP for Reading and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was a member of the first Court of the University of Reading following its receipt of a Royal Charter in 1926. Williams was returned to Parliament in Croydon South in a by-election in February 1932. He was comfortably re-elected in 1935 and served through the war. He was vocal in arguing against the Beveridge Report in Parliament, despite it being proposed by his Croydon Conservative colleague, Henry Willink MP. He was an alderman of London County Council in 1940‚Äì45. Sir Herbert lost his seat in the 1945 General Election to Labour's David Rees-Williams. In February 1950, the Croydon seats were rearranged and the Conservatives won all three seats. Sir Herbert was returned in the new Croydon East seat and was re- elected in 1951. He was made a baronet on 3 July 1953. He died in 1954 and a by-election was held in his seat in September.

The facility, which was the property of Media Broadcast, was built between 1965 and 1967 on a former airfield, and entered service on March 10, 1967. It was part of an omnidirectional aerial, consisting of four 200-metre-high radio masts, which were connected using wires on their tops. The middle mast was fed via radio power. This very efficient transmission aerial led to interference with the Romanian transmitter Bra≈üov on the same frequency, so only 70 kilowatts of power were used, instead of 250. But even with this reduced power, interference to Bra≈üov occurred, so in 1972 the radio facility Donebach was rebuilt as a directional aerial with a minimum towards Bra≈üov. Therefore two radio masts were taken down and the remaining two were rebuilt as umbrella aerials. This made a transmission power of 250 kilowatts possible. The Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 set new power limits to the Donebach transmitter and now there was a daytime operation with 500 kilowatts and a night time operation at night time. This facility was remarkable because *the frequency of the carrier was derived from a rubidium atomic clock, which was in the station building. It was as the carrier frequency of DCF77, a standard frequency. *the 363-metre-high masts were the second tallest structures in Germany, just behind the Fernsehturm Berlin.

Origins The lyrics to \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" were written by the Irish-American bandleader Patrick Gilmore during the American Civil War. Its first sheet music publication was deposited in the Library of Congress on September 26, 1863, with words and music credited to \\"Louis Lambert\\"; copyright was retained by the publisher, Henry Tolman & Co., of Boston.Lighter, pp. 16‚Äì17. Why Gilmore chose to publish under a pseudonym is not clear, but popular composers of the period often employed pseudonyms to add a touch of romantic mystery to their compositions.Lighter, p. 16. Gilmore is said to have written the song for his sister Annie as she prayed for the safe return of her fianc√©, Union Light Artillery Captain John O'Rourke, from the Civil War, although it is not clear if they were already engaged in 1863; the two were not married until 1875.Lighter, pp. 70‚Äì71. Gilmore later acknowledged that the music was not original but was, as he put it in an 1883 article in the Musical Herald, \\"a musical waif which I happened to hear somebody humming in the early days of the rebellion, and taking a fancy to it, wrote it down, dressed it up, gave it a name, and rhymed it into usefulness for a special purpose suited to the times.\\"Lighter, p. 17. The melody was previously published around July 1, 1863, as the music to the Civil War drinking song \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\".Lighter, pp. 18‚Äì19. A color- illustrated, undated slip of Gilmore's lyrics, printed by his own Boston publisher, actually states that \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" should be sung to the tune of \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\".Lighter, p. 21. The original sheet music for \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\" states that the music was arranged (not composed) by J. Durnal.Lighter, p. 19. There is a melodic resemblance of the tune to that of \\"John Anderson, My Jo\\" (to which Robert Burns wrote lyrics to fit a pre-existing tune dating from about 1630 or earlier), and Jonathan Lighter has suggested a connection to the seventeenth-century ballad \\"The Three Ravens\\".Lighter, pp. 21‚Äì28. \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" is also sung to the same tune as \\"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\\" and is frequently thought to have been a rewriting of that song. However, \\"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\\" was not published until 1867, and it originally had a different melody.Lighter, pp. 28‚Äì29. \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" was immensely popular and was sung by both sides of the American Civil War.Erbsen, p. 68 It became a hit in England as well.Lighter, p. 15. =Alternative versions= Quite a few variations on the song, as well as songs set to the same tune but with different lyrics, have appeared since \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" was popularized. The alleged larcenous tendencies of some Union soldiers in New Orleans were parodied in the lyrics \\"For Bales\\", to the same tune. A British version appeared in 1914, with the similar title, \\"When Tommy Comes Marching Home\\". The 1880 U.S. Presidential election campaign featured a campaign song called \\"If the Johnnies Get Into Power\\".Jay Nordlinger, \\"American Sounds: A little music with your politics ‚Äì music at political conventions\\", National Review, 2000-09-11 Lyrics Illustration of a Zouave company on Civil War era broadside of \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\".

Hurrah! The men will cheer and the boys will > shout The ladies they will all turn out :And we'll all feel gay When Johnny > comes marching home. The old church bell will peal with joy :Hurrah!

Later recordings end each verse with \\"And we'll all feel glad when Johnny comes marching home.\\" \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\" \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\", which provided the tune for \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\", was a topical drinking song that commented on events in the American Civil War. It was frequently refitted with new words by soldiers and other publishers. A satirical variant of \\"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\\", entitled \\"For Bales\\" or, more fully, \\"For Bales! An O'er True Tale. Dedicated to Those Pure Patriots Who Were Afflicted with 'Cotton on the Brain' and Who Saw The Elephant\\", was published in New Orleans in 1864, by A. E.

He built Quarry Bank Mill, which at his retirement was the largest textile mill in the country. He and his wife Hannah Greg took their responsibilities to their employees seriously, building a model village alongside the factory. Early life and background Greg was born in Belfast, Ireland, the second son of a successful merchant. At the age of eight, he went to live with his maternal uncle, Robert Hyde, at Ardwick Hall, Manchester, in the heart of England. His uncles, Robert and Nathaniel, were linen merchants and, after completing his education at Harrow School, near London, Samuel joined their business in 1778. Career Robert Hyde died in 1782; his brother's alcoholism rendered him incapable of running the business; Greg took over the enterprise. Seeing opportunities for manufacturing opened up by the Industrial Revolution, Greg founded Quarry Bank Mill, a cotton spinning mill in Styal on the bank of the River Bollin in Cheshire. Greg was quick to adopt innovations in the rapidly developing technologies of manufacturing and a partnership with Peter Ewart enabled him to exploit developments in water wheel and steam power. Greg built up a model village of modest but salubrious housing on the Styal estate, not for philanthropic reasons but as an essential element in his vision of the efficient factory system. In 1789 he married Hannah Lightbody (1766‚Äì1828), the daughter of a wealthy Unitarian Liverpool merchant. She was the youngest of three sisters. and had been educated at a progressive school in Stoke Newington. Samuel was Presbyterian and so she introduced him to her Unitarian faith, Cross Street Chapel, and the influential network of Manchester and Liverpool trading and banking families. Her religious and social views influenced his approach to the workers' welfare. Hannah gave birth to 13 children. The Gregs had mills in Reddish, Calver, Bollington, Lancaster and Caton. In the Escowbeck Estate, in Caton they built their own observatory. In 1832, Greg was attacked by a stag in the grounds of Quarry Bank Mill. The injury led to his retirement. By this time, it had become the largest spinning and weaving business in the United Kingdom. Greg never recovered from the attack and died two years later. Family Already a wealthy man, in 1789, Samuel Greg married Hannah Lightbody, a prominent Unitarian, and set up a family home at 35 King Street, Manchester. She bore him six daughters and seven sons. In 1796, he built Quarry Bank House in Styal while retaining his town house. Greg was active as a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and he too was a Unitarian. Of Hannah and Samuel's thirteen children Robert Hyde Greg (1795‚Äì1875), John (1801‚Äì1882), Samuel Greg Jr. (1804‚Äì1876) and William Rathbone Greg (1809‚Äì1881) entered the business. Robert Hyde Greg was interested in astronomy and politics and was elected MP for Manchester in 1839. John was responsible for the Lancaster and Caton mills and eventually the Bollington mill. He was alderman and mayor of Lancaster. Samuel Jr. took charge of the Bollington mill and unsuccessfully experimented with profit sharing; disillusioned, he became a preacher. William was responsible for Hudcar Mill in Bury and then took over the troubled Bollington Mill; retiring from the business in 1850 he became Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, and an avid essayist and pamphleteer. Elizabeth Greg (1790‚Äì1882) married William Rathbone V, of the Liverpool mercantile family. She founded the first public wash-houses in the United Kingdom in the wake of the 1832 cholera epidemic. Later she helped William Forster in formulating the 1870 Education Act. Bibliography *Rose, M.B.

In 1997, 't Hof van Commerce was founded, and in 1998, they release their first album En in Izzegem, referring to the little city Izegem where the band was founded. About 8000 albums were sold. That was quite a high number for a debut because the entire CD was sung in West Flemish, only understood by about one million people. The next year, they already had a second CD with the title Herman. That album was sold 5000 times. In 2000 Flip Kowlier started a successful solo career as a singer-songwriter, while staying a member of 't Hof van Commerce. Two years later, in 2002, they got their third album, titled Rocky 7. That album was their biggest success this far, with 10 000 sells. So in 2003, 't Hof (how they call themselves) was asked a lot in festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands. In 2005, 't Hof released another album with the title Ezoa en niet anders (This way and not differently). For the first time under their own record label Plasticine. For that record, a lot of guest rappers were invited such as TLP and Gabriel Rios. In 2011, Flip Kowlier temporarily stopped his (still successful) solo career, to continue with 't Hof van Commerce after a long silence. This resulted in a new album in 2012 with the title Stuntman. 't Hof van Commerce has been on hiatus between October 2013 and January 2018.

Illustration by F. H. Townsend for the second edition of the book. The Gytrash , a legendary black dog known in Northern England, was said to haunt lonely roads awaiting travelers. Appearing in the shape of horses, mules, cranes or dogs, the Gytrash haunt solitary ways and lead people astray but they can also be benevolent, guiding lost travelers to the right road. They are usually feared. In some parts of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, the Guytrash was known as the Shagfoal and took the form of a spectral mule or donkey with eyes that glowed like burning coals. In this form, the beast was believed to be purely malevolent. The Gytrash's emergence as Rochester's innocuous dog Pilot has been interpreted as a subtle mockery of the mysteriousness and romanticism that surrounds his character and which clouds Jane's perception. Bront√´'s reference in 1847 is probably the earliest reference to the beast and forms the basis for subsequent citations. This spirit is also known as Guytrash and Guytresh according to The English Dialect Dictionary of Joseph Wright (1855‚Äì1930) where it is defined as a ghost that takes the form of an animal.

The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem in algebraic geometry, and the ideal class group in algebraic number theory, of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential van der Waerden text on abstract algebra from around 1930. The ideal theory in question had been based on elimination theory, but in line with David Hilbert's taste moved away from algorithmic methods. Gr√∂bner basis theory has now reversed the trend, for computer algebra. The importance of the idea of a module, more general than an ideal, probably led to the perception that ideal theory was too narrow a description. Valuation theory, too, was an important technical extension, and was used by Helmut Hasse and Oscar Zariski. Bourbaki used commutative algebra; sometimes local algebra is applied to the theory of local rings. Douglas Northcott's 1953 Cambridge Tract Ideal Theory (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.  Topology determined by an ideal  Let R be a ring and M an R-module. Then each ideal \\\\mathfrak{a} of R determines a topology on M called the \\\\mathfrak{a}-adic topology such that a subset U of M is open if and only if for each x in U there exists a positive integer n such that :x + \\\\mathfrak{a}^n M \\\\subset U. With respect to this \\\\mathfrak{a}-adic topology, \\\\\\\\{x + \\\\mathfrak{a}^n M\\\\\\\\}_{n} is a basis of neighbourhoods of x and makes the module operations continuous; in particular, M is a possibly non-Hausdorff topological group. Also, M is a Hausdorff topological space if and only if \\\\bigcap_{n > 0} \\\\mathfrak{a}^nM = 0. Moreover, when M is Hausdorff, the topology is the same as the metric space topology given by defining the distance function: d(x, y) = 2^{-n} for x e y, where n is an integer such that x - y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}^n M - \\\\mathfrak{a}^{n+1} M. Given a submodule N of M, the \\\\mathfrak{a}-closure of N in M is equal to \\\\bigcap_{n > 0} (N + \\\\mathfrak{a}^n M), as shown easily. Now, a priori, on a submodule N of M, there are two natural \\\\mathfrak{a}-topologies: the subspace topology induced by the \\\\mathfrak{a}-adic topology on M and the \\\\mathfrak{a}-adic topology on N. However, when R is Noetherian and M is finite over it, those two topologies coincide as a consequence of the Artin‚ÄìRees lemma. When M is Hausdorff, M can be completed as a metric space; the resulting space is denoted by \\\\widehat{M} and has the module structure obtained by extending the module operations by continuity. It is also the same as (or canonically isomorphic to): :\\\\widehat{M} = \\\\varprojlim M/\\\\mathfrak{a}^n M where the right-hand side is the completion of the module M with respect to \\\\mathfrak{a}. Example: Let R = k[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n] be a polynomial ring over a field and \\\\mathfrak{a} = (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) the maximal ideal. Then \\\\widehat{R} = k [\\\\\\\\![x_1, \\\\dots, x_n]\\\\\\\\!] is a formal power series ring. R is called a Zariski ring with respect to \\\\mathfrak{a} if every ideal in R is \\\\mathfrak{a}-closed. There is a characterization: :R is a Zariski ring with respect to \\\\mathfrak{a} if and only if \\\\mathfrak{a} is contained in the Jacobson radical of R. In particular a Noetherian local ring is a Zariski ring with respect to the maximal ideal.  System of parameters  A system of parameters for a local Noetherian ring of Krull dimension d with maximal ideal m is a set of elements x1, ..., xd that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: # m is a minimal prime over (x1, ..., xd). # The radical of (x1, ..., xd) is m. # Some power of m is contained in (x1, ..., xd). # (x1, ..., xd) is m-primary. Every local Noetherian ring admits a system of parameters. It is not possible for fewer than d elements to generate an ideal whose radical is m because then the dimension of R would be less than d. If M is a k-dimensional module over a local ring, then x1, ..., xk is a system of parameters for M if the length of is finite.  Reduction theory  The reduction theory goes back to the influential 1954 paper by Northcott and Rees, the paper that introduced the basic notions. In algebraic geometry, the theory is among the essential tools to extract detailed information about the behaviors of blow-ups. Given ideals J ‚äÇ I in a ring R, the ideal J is said to be a reduction of I if there is some integer m > 0 such that JI^m = I^{m+1}. For such ideals, immediately from the definition, the following hold: *For any k, J^k I^m = J^{k-1}I^{m+1} = \\\\cdots = I^{m+k}. *J and I have the same radical and the same set of minimal prime ideals over them (the converse is false). If R is a Noetherian ring, then J is a reduction of I if and only if the Rees algebra R[It] is finite over R[Jt]. (This is the reason for the relation to a blow up.) A closely related notion is that of analytic spread. By definition, the fiber cone ring of a Noetherian local ring (R, \\\\mathfrak{m}) along an ideal I is :\\\\mathcal{F}_I(R) = R[It] \\\\otimes_R \\\\kappa(\\\\mathfrak{m}) \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} I^n/\\\\mathfrak{m} I^n. The Krull dimension of \\\\mathcal{F}_I(R) is called the analytic spread of I. Given a reduction J \\\\subset I, the minimum number of generators of J is at least the analytic spread of I. Also, a partial converse holds for infinite fields: if R/\\\\mathfrak m is infinite and if the integer \\\\ell is the analytic spread of I, then each reduction of I contains a reduction generated by \\\\ell elements.  Local cohomology in ideal theory  Local cohomology can sometimes be used to obtain information on an ideal. This section assumes some familiarity with sheaf theory and scheme theory. Let M be a module over a ring R and I an ideal. Then M determines the sheaf \\\\widetilde{M} on Y = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R) - V(I) (the restriction to Y of the sheaf associated to M). Unwinding the definition, one sees: :\\\\Gamma_I(M) := \\\\Gamma(Y, \\\\widetilde{M}) = \\\\varinjlim \\\\operatorname{Hom}(I^n, M). Here, \\\\Gamma_I(M) is called the ideal transform of M with respect to I.

Its successor, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), expired on 1 January 2005. History Since the (re)emergence of developing countries as a source of cotton textile production, after the Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, such as India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan's Khadi production in the Swadeshi movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, cotton production from these countries steadily increased after colonial independence. A number of treaties concerning Short-Term Arrangements regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 21 July 1961); Long-Term Arrangement regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles (Geneva, 9 February 1962 and 15 June 1970), and Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles (Geneva, 20 December 1973) attempted to address the issue of what seemed a natural dominance of developing world in cotton textile production at the time. Eventually, the Multi Fibre Agreement was established in 1974. Impact The MFA was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed countries to adjust to imports from the developing world. Developing countries and countries without a welfare state have a comparative advantage in textile production because it is labor-intensive and their poor social insurance systems allow them low labor costs. According to a World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) study, the system has cost the developing world 27 million jobs and $40 billion a year in lost exports.Presentation by H.E. K.M. Chandrasekhar, Chairman ITCB, EC Conference on the Future of Textiles and Clothing after 2004, Brussels, 5 ‚Äì 6 May 2003. http://www.itcb.org/Documents/ITCB-MI35.pdf Developing countries have resisted moves such as a social clause in tariff agreements, to link them to improvements in working conditions. The Arrangement was not negative for all developing countries. For example, the European Union (EU) imposed no restrictions or duties on imports from the emerging countries, such as Bangladesh, leading to a massive expansion of the industry. At the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round, it was decided to bring the textile trade under the jurisdiction of the World Trade Organization. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provided for the gradual dismantling of the quotas that existed under the MFA. This process was completed on 1 January 2005. However, large tariffs remained in place on many textile products. Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from China. However, this was not the case. It turns out that even in the face of other economic giants, Bangladesh‚Äôs labor is \\"cheaper than anywhere else in the world.\\" While some smaller factories were documented making pay cuts and layoffs, most downsizing was essentially speculative ‚Äì the orders for goods kept coming even after the MFA expired. In fact, Bangladesh's exports increased in value by about $500 million in 2006.Haider, Mahtab. \\"Defying predictions, Bangladesh‚Äôs garment factories thrive.\\" The Christian Science Monitor. 7 Feb 2006. 11 Feb 2007. http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0207/p04s02-wosc.html However, poorer countries within the developed world, such as Greece and Portugal, are expected to lose out. During early 2005, textile and clothing exports from China to the West grew by 100% or more in many items, leading the US and EU to cite China's WTO accession agreement allowing them to restrict the rate of growth to 7.5% per year until 2008. In June, China agreed with the EU to limit the rate to 10% for 3 years. No such agreement was reached with the US, which imposed its own import growth quotas of 7.5% instead. When the EU announced their new quotas to replace the lapsed MFA, Chinese manufacturers accelerated their shipping of the goods intended for the European market. This used up a full year's quota almost immediately. As a result, 75 million items of imported Chinese garments were held in European ports in August 2005. A diplomatic resolution was reached at the beginning of September 2005 during Tony Blair's visit to China, putting an end to a situation the UK press had dubbed \\"Bra Wars\\".

He was among a group of leading secessionists known as Fire-Eaters, advocating the preservation and expansion of an aristocratic agricultural society based on slave labor. He briefly served as a Confederate Brigadier General of the Texas Brigade at the outset of the American Civil War before taking his seat in the Confederate Senate. Wigfall's reputation for oratory and hard-drinking, along with a combative nature and high-minded sense of personal honor, made him one of the more imposing political figures of his time. Early life and career =Youth= Wigfall was born on a plantation near Edgefield, South Carolina, to Levi Durant and Eliza Thomson Wigfall. His father, who died in 1818, was a successful Charleston merchant before moving to Edgefield. His mother was of the French Huguenot Trezavant family. She died when young Louis was 13. An older brother, Hamden, was killed in a duel. Another, Arthur, became a bishop in the Episcopal Church.Ritter, pg. 434 Tutored by a guardian until 1834, he then spent a year at Rice Creek Springs School, a military academy near Columbia, South Carolina, for children of elite aristocrats. He then entered the University of Virginia. A perceived insult by another student prompted the first of many dueling challenges he would make, but the affair was resolved peaceably.Cashion, p. 58. The claim in this version was that he was expelled. In 1836 he entered South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) to complete his studies, but his attendance was erratic. He developed an interest in the law, participated in the Euphradian Society, and wrote epistles on student rights. Most of his time however, was spent at off-campus taverns rather than at his studies.Green, p. 49. \\"An act of the legislature was secured in 1837 forbidding the sale of liquor to students as minors; drinking was the cause of the greatest disorders on campus.\\" He abandoned academics altogether for three months to fight in the Second Seminole War in Florida, achieving the rank of Lieutenant of volunteers. Despite these distractions he managed to graduate in 1837.Walther, pp. 161-162 A fellow graduate considered to be his closest friend was John Lawrence Manning, who would later become governor of South Carolina. In 1839 Wigfall returned to Edgefield and took over his brother's law practice. Having squandered his inheritance, and with a proclivity for drinking and gambling,Allegedly, these habits coincided with frequent visits to an Augusta, Georgia, brothel. he accumulated debts. He borrowed from friends to maintain a freewheeling lifestyle, including from his future bride. \\"Mere office business\\" as an upcountry lawyer did not suit his temperament and sense of purpose, nor prove to be as profitable as he had hoped. =Personal life= In 1841 Wigfall married his second cousin, Charlotte Maria Cross, daughter of the prominent Charlestown lawyer and former South Carolina State Controller, Col. George Warren Cross, and his wife, Frances Maria Halsey. Their Children were: * Francis Halsey Wigfall. * Louise Sophie Wigfall, Civil War diarist. * Mary Frances (Fanny) Wigfall. =Violence and politics= In the South Carolina gubernatorial election of 1840, Wigfall actively supported the candidacy of John Peter Richardson over the more radical James Henry Hammond, which led to public exchanges of arguments and insults. In a five- month period, Wigfall managed to get into a fistfight, two duels, three near- duels, and was charged, but not indicted, for killing a man.Wigfall shot and killed Thomas Bird, a cousin to Preston Brooks, when he attempted to remove \\"postings\\" at the Edgefield courthouse that called Brooks' father a coward for rejecting a duel challenge. This outbreak of political violence culminated in 1840 on an island in the Savannah River near Augusta, Georgia, where Wigfall took a bullet through both thighs while dueling with future Congressman Preston Brooks.New York Times archive on Brooks-Wigfall duel Brooks suffered a wounded hip in the affair and had to use a walking cane for the rest of his life. He would famously use that cane on the floor of the U.S. Senate against Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner in 1856. Although Hammond lost the race for Governor, he attempted to mediate the dispute between the two hot-headed young men. Wigfall received an aide-de-camp and Lieutenant Colonelcy on Governor Richardson's staff, but never was completely satisfied with the outcome of the Brooks affair.Hammond, p. 60-62. Hammond thought the difficulty between the two started much earlier. Wigfall's letters to his friend John Manning suggest that he and Brooks were courting the same Augusta belle prior to the election. This initial foray into politics and the Brooks affair destroyed his law practice. He was elected delegate to the South Carolina Democratic convention in 1844, but his violent temperament and behind-the- scenes meddling had already doomed his youthful political ambitions. He piled up medical bills because of a sickly infant son who eventually died. Sheriff sales followed, swallowing up his Edgefield estate. A Texas cousin, former South Carolina governor James Hamilton, Jr., arranged a fresh start with a law partnership.Burton, p. 70, Jewett, p. 16 Wigfall's reputation as a duelist, often exaggerated, followed him his entire life, even though he gave up the practice entirely after his marriage. However, he would continue to claim the code duello was an important \\"factor in the improvement of both the morals and manners of the community.\\"Wright, p. 32 =Gone to Texas= Arriving in Texas in 1848,Several accounts claim he arrived in 1846. His wife's whereabouts can be traced to Rhode Island during this time. their infant son, John Manning Wigfall, was buried in a Providence, Rhode Island cemetery in 1846 and their daughter Louise was born there in December 1846 according to census records, among other sources. Wigfall joined William B. Ochiltree's law practice at Nacogdoches, Texas, then settled in Marshall, Texas. He quickly dove back into politics, serving in the Texas House of Representatives from 1849 to 1850, and in the Texas Senate from 1857 to 1860. He became a staunch political opponent of Sam Houston. When Houston ran for governor in 1857, Wigfall followed him on the campaign trail, attacking his congressional record at each of Houston's stops, and accused Houston of being a traitor to the South. He claimed that Houston had ambitions for a presidential nomination and courted the support of Northern abolitionists.Walther, pg. 169 He organized state Democrats to resist the Know Nothing party, but with their defeat his radical views descended in the estimation of Democratic moderates. John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry propelled him and his radical views back to prominence in the state. =United States Senator= The Texas legislature elected Wigfall to the United States Senate in 1859 as a Democrat to the 36th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Pinckney Henderson. Matthias Ward was appointed to the Senate following Henderson's death and served from September 27, 1858 until Wigfall was elected and sworn in on December 5, 1859.United States Congress website http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000138 Wigfall served until March 23, 1861, when he withdrew. He was expelled from the Senate on July 11, 1861 for support of the rebellion.United States Congress website http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000447 He also served as a member of the Texas delegation to the Provisional Confederate Congress, which formed the provisional government of the Confederacy, and which selected Jefferson Davis as its president. Wigfall had continued to hold his seat after Texas had seceded on February 1, 1861 and was admitted to the Provisional Confederate Congress on March 2, 1861, exhorting the rightness of the Southern cause and berating his Northern colleagues whether on the floor of the Senate or in Capitol Hill saloons. During this time in Washington, he spied on Federal preparations for the coming conflict, secured weapons for delivery south, and upon expulsion by his fellow Senators, he went to Baltimore, Maryland and recruited soldiers for the new Confederacy before traveling to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia.Eicher, p.12. Wigfall concocted a scheme to kidnap President James Buchanan so that Vice President John C. Breckinridge, a friend and fellow southerner, could assume the presidency. American Civil War Louis Wigfall in 1861 In the days leading up to the start of hostilities, Wigfall advocated an attack on Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens in Florida to prompt Virginia and other upper southern slave states to join the Confederacy. In January 1865, Wigfall stated his reasons for having supported the Confederacy, namely, opposition to African American equality: He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, as the siege of Fort Sumter commenced. According to diarist Mary Chesnut, he was the only \\"thoroughly happy person I see.\\"Chestnut, p. 34 While serving as an aide to General Beauregard during the bombardment of Fort Sumter, and without authorization, he rowed a skiff out to the island fort and demanded its surrender from Major Robert Anderson.Wright, p. 41, Walther, p, Eicher, p. 47 The incident was widely reported in the newspapers furthering his celebrity, but the story redacted the important detail that Wigfall had not spoken to Beauregard in two days. When the authorized emissaries arrived at the fort, they were dismayed upon learning that Wigfall had granted terms to Anderson which Beauregard had already rejected.Eicher, p. 47 =Brigade commander= With his newfound celebrity Wigfall secured an appointment to full colonel of the 1st Texas Infantry Regiment, and a rapid promotion thereafter to brigadier general of the \\"Texas Brigade\\" in the Confederate Army. He took up residence near his encamped troops in a tavern at Dumfries, Virginia, during the winter of 1861‚Äì1862, where he would frequently call the men to arms at midnight, imagining a Federal invasion.Polley, pg. 16 Colonels Hood and Archer would refuse to call their men to the color line on these instances until General Wigfall had sent down direct orders to do so. His nervousness was blamed on his fondness for whiskey and hard cider. He appeared visibly drunk, on and off-duty, in the presence of his men on more than one occasion.Simpson, p. 78, Polley p. 15 \\"Wigfall's imagination was too often quickened by deep potations to be reliable.\\" He resigned his commission in February 1862 to take a seat in the Confederate Senate, and was replaced by John Bell Hood.Heidler, pg. 2104 =Confederate States Senator= At the beginning of the war Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Like political alliances throughout his career, he would first support then split with Davis as the war progressed. Davis supported an increasingly strong national government, while Wigfall, forever an advocate of states rights, moved to block the creation of the Confederate Supreme Court, fearing Davis' appointments would rule against the states. Wigfall also challenged Davis, a West Point graduate and former United States Secretary of War, on many of his military-related policies, citing his own military experience in the Seminole Wars. Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and frequently proposed legislation on the general's behalf. He was also an early proponent of making Robert E. Lee commander of all Confederate armies. Later life At the conclusion of hostilities, Wigfall escaped back to Texas in the company of Texas troops with a forged parole,Wright, p. ? then went to London, in 1866 as an exileEicher, p. 12 where he intrigued to foment trouble between Britain and the United States. He bought a mine in Clear Creek, Colorado, returning to the United States in 1870.Casson, p. 24. Some give the year of return as 1871 or 1872, but he appears on the 1870 Colorado census with his son Francis. He lived for a while in Baltimore, Maryland, and was in Galveston, Texas, in January, 1874.Hammond, p. 328. A biographical note claims he was on a lecture tour. He died a month later of \\"apoplexy\\" and is buried there in the Episcopal cemetery.Billups, pg. 144 In popular culture In the 1992 alternate history/science fiction novel The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove, Senator Wigfall appears as a character.

The species formerly included the Andaman teal Anas albogularis and the grey teal, Anas gracilis as subspecies, but is currently considered monotypic. A molecular phylogentic study published in 2009 that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae found that the Sunda teal is a sister species to the chestnut teal (Anas castanea) that is found in Australia. This is a mottled brown duck with white and green flashes on its wings. The male and female Sunda teal share the same colouration, in contrast to the related chestnut teal, whose male and female are strikingly different. The nominate Sunda teal has almost identical colouration to the female chestnut teal and can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck, paler face and especially the bulging forehead. The Andaman teal has a variable amount of white on the forehead and around the eyes. The Rennell Island teal looked like a smaller version of the nominate subspecies, with a stubbier bill. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head. The Sunda teal nests near its favoured freshwater lakes and marshes, usually on the ground, but also in tree holes or rabbit burrows. This is a vocal duck, especially at night. The male gives a soft peep, and the female has a loud quack.

Early life He was born in Solln, near Munich. His parents were Karl T. Fischer, Professor of Physics at the Technical University of Munich (TU), and Valentine n√©e Danzer. He graduated in 1937 with Abitur. Before the completion of two years' compulsory military service, the Second World War broke out, and he served in Poland, France, and Russia. During a period of study leave, towards the end of 1941 he began to study chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. Following the end of the War, he was released by the Americans in the autumn of 1945 and resumed his studies, graduating in 1949. Career Fischer worked on his doctoral thesis as an assistant to Professor Walter Hieber in the Inorganic Chemistry Institute, His thesis was entitled \\"The Mechanisms of Carbon Monoxide Reactions of Nickel(II) Salts in the Presence of Dithionites and Sulfoxylates\\". After receiving his doctorate in 1952, he continued his research on the organometallic chemistry of the transition metal and indicated with his lecturer thesis on \\"The Metal Complexes of Cyclopentadienes and Indenes\\" that the structure postulated by Pauson and Keally might be wrong. Shortly after he published the structural data of ferrocene, the sandwich structure of the Œ∑5 (pentahapto) compound. He was appointed a lecturer at the TU in 1955 and, in 1957, professor and then, in 1959, C4 professor. In 1964 he took the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the TU. In 1964, he was elected a member of the Mathematics/Natural Science section of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. In 1969 he was appointed a member of the German Academy of Natural Scientists, Leopoldina and in 1972 was given an honorary doctorate by the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy of the University of Munich. He lectured across the world on metal complexes of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, arenes, olefins, and metal carbonyls. In the 1960s his group discovered a metal alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes, since referred to as Fischer carbenes and Fischer-carbynes. Overall he published about 450 journal articles and he trained many PhD and postdoctoral students, many of whom went on to noteworthy careers. Among his many foreign lectureships, he was Firestone Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1969), visiting professor at the University of Florida (1971), and Arthur D. Little visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1973). He has received many awards including, in 1973 with Geoffrey Wilkinson, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on organometallic compounds. Death Tomb of Ernst Otto Fischer He died on 23 July 2007 in Munich.derStandard.at At the time of his death, Fischer was the oldest living German Nobel laureate. He was succeeded by Manfred Eigen, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 and is nine years younger than Fischer was. References *C. Elschenbroich, A.

Thai Chinese are the largest minority group in the country and the largest overseas Chinese community in the world with a population of over 11 million people, accounting for 14‚Äì16% of the total population of the country as of 2015. Unofficial figure as claimed is said to be over 15 million. It is also the oldest and most prominent integrated overseas Chinese community. Slightly more than half of the ethnic Chinese population in Thailand trace their ancestry to eastern Guangdong Province. This is evidenced by the prevalence of the Southern Min and Teochew dialect among the Chinese in Thailand. A minority trace their ancestry to Hakka and Hainanese immigrants. The Thai Chinese have been deeply ingrained into all elements of Thai society over the past 200 years. The present Thai royal family, the Chakri dynasty, was founded by King Rama I who himself was partly Chinese. His predecessor, King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom, was the son of a Mon-Thai mother and a Chinese father from Guangdong. With the successful integration of historic Chinese immigrant communities in Thailand, a significant number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and native Thais. Many of these descendants have assimilated into Thai society and self-identify solely as Thai. Thai Chinese are a well-established middle class ethnic group and are well represented at all levels of Thai society. They play a leading role in Thailand's business sector and dominate the Thai economy today. In addition, Thai Chinese have a strong presence in Thailand's political scene with most of Thailand's former Prime Ministers and the majority of parliament having at least some Chinese ancestry. Thais of Chinese descent are also well represented among Thailand's military and royalist elite. Demographics Thailand has the largest overseas Chinese community in the world outside Greater China. 14 to 16 percent of Thailand's population are considered ethnic Chinese. The Thai linguist Theraphan Luangthongkum estimates the share of those having at least partial Chinese ancestry at about 40 percent of the Thai population. Identity For assimilated second and third generation descendants of Chinese immigrants, it is principally a personal choice whether or not to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese. Nonetheless, nearly all Thai Chinese solely self-identify as Thai, due to their close integration and successful assimilation into Thai society. G. William Skinner observed that the level of assimilation of the descendants of Chinese immigrants in Thailand disproved the \\"myth about the 'unchanging Chinese'\\", noting that \\"assimilation is considered complete when the immigrant's descendant identifies himself in almost all social situations as a Thai, speaks Thai language habitually and with native fluency, and interacts by choice with Thai more often than with Chinese.\\" Skinner believed that the assimilation success of the Thai Chinese was a result of the wise policy of the Thai rulers who, since the 17th century, allowed able Chinese tradesmen to advance their ranks into the kingdom's nobility. The rapid and successful assimilation of the Thai Chinese has been celebrated by the Chinese descendants themselves, as evident in contemporary literature such as the novel Letters from Thailand () by Botan. Today, the Thai Chinese constitute a significant part of the royalist/nationalist movements. When the then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is Thai Chinese, was ousted from power in 2006, it was Sondhi Limthongkul, another prominent Thai Chinese businessman, who formed and led People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement to protest the successive governments run by Thaksin's allies.The Symbolism of Sondhi's Hat Mr. Sondhi accused Mr. Thaksin of corruption based on improper business ties between Thaksin's corporate empire and the Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Group. The Thai Chinese in and around Bangkok were also the main participants of the months-long political campaign against the government of Ms. Yingluck (Mr. Thaksin's sister), between November 2013 and May 2014, the event which culminated in the military takeover in May 2014.  History  Han Chinese traders, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong, began arriving in Ayutthaya by at least the 13th century. According to the Chronicles of Ayutthaya, King Ekathotsarot (r. 1605‚Äì1610) had been \\"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\\" and was \\"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\\" especially Spain, Portugal, China, Japan, and the Philippines. Ayutthaya was under almost constant Burmese threat from the 16th century onward, and the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the Burmese, but the Sino-Burmese Wars ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1765‚Äì1767). However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General Taksin, himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from Chaozhou prefecture came to Siam in large numbers. Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population of Thailand was Chinese. The early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of men who did not bring women. Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called Sino-Thai or luk-jin (‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô) in Thai. These Chinese-Thai intermarriages declined somewhat in the early 20th century, when significant numbers of Chinese women also began immigrating to Thailand. The corruption of the Qing dynasty and the massive population increase in China, along with very high taxes, caused many men to leave China for Thailand in search of work. If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \\"tax farming\\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues. In the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the Haw Wars (). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti- Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations. From 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from southern China which was vulnerable to floods and drought, mostly settling in Bangkok and along the coast of the Gulf of Siam. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and rickshaw pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations, both domestically and internationally. However, republican ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated Chinese schools even before compulsory education was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a Thai language test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai Ministry of Education. Legislation by King Rama VI (1910‚Äì1925) that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left Burma between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the Ratchaburi and Kanchanaburi Provinces of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century. The Chinese in Thailand did experience some sort of discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself), which allied itself with the Empire of Japan. The Primary Education Act of 1932 made the Thai language the compulsory medium of education, but as a result of protests from Thai Chinese, by 1939, students were allowed two hours per week of Mandarin instruction. State corporations took over commodities such as rice, tobacco, and petroleum and Chinese businesses found themselves subject to a range of new taxes and controls. By 1970, more than 90 percent of the Chinese born in Thailand had abandoned Chinese citizenship and were granted Thai citizenship instead. In 1975, diplomatic relations were established with China. Culture Intermarriage with Thais has resulted in many people who claim Thai ethnicity with Chinese ancestry. People of Chinese descent are concentrated in the coastal and central areas of Thailand, principally Bangkok, Chonburi, Suphanburi, Rayong and Nakhon Sawan provinces . Considerable segments of Thailand's academic, business, and political elites are of Chinese descent. Language Today, nearly all ethnic Chinese in Thailand speak Thai exclusively. Only elderly Chinese immigrants still speak their native varieties of Chinese. The rapid and successful assimilation of Thai Chinese has been celebrated in contemporary literature such as \\"Letters from Thailand\\" () by a Thai Chinese author Botan. In the modern Thai language there are many signs of Chinese influence. In the 2000 census, 231,350 people identified themselves as speakers of a variant of Chinese (Teochew, Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese, or Hakka). The Teochew dialect has served as the language of Bangkok's influential Chinese merchants' circles since the foundation of the city in the 18th century. Although Chinese language schools were closed during the nationalist period before and during the Second World War, the Thai government never tried to suppress Chinese cultural expression. Today, businesses in Yaowarat Road and Charoen Krung Road in Bangkok's Samphanthawong District which constitute the city's \\"Chinatown\\" still feature bilingual signs in Chinese and Thai. A number of Chinese words have found their way into the Thai language, especially the names of dishes and foodstuffs, as well as basic numbers (such as those from \\"three\\" to \\"ten\\") and terms related to gambling. Chin Haw Chinese speak Southwestern Mandarin. The rise of China's prominence on the global economic stage has prompted many Thai Chinese business families to see Mandarin as a beneficial asset in partaking in economic links and conducting business between Thailand and Mainland China, with some families encouraging their children to learn Mandarin in order to reap the benefits of their ethnic Chinese identity and the increasing role of Mandarin as a prominent language of Overseas Chinese business communities. However, equally there are many Thais, regardless of their ethnic background who study Chinese in order to boost their business and career opportunities, rather than due to reasons of ethnic identity, with some sending their children to newly established Mandarin language schools. Rise to economic dominance Historically, Thai Chinese set up small enterprises such as street stalls to eke out a living, a humble profession passed on to the present day. =19th century= British East India Company agent John Crawfurd used detailed company records kept on Prince of Wales's Island (present-day Penang) from 1815 to 1824 to analyze the productivity of the 8,595 Chinese resident there vis-a-vis other ethnic groups. Astonished by their competence, he concluded that the Chinese population, about five-sixths of whom were unmarried men in the prime of life, \\"in point of effective labour, may be measured as equivalent to an ordinary population of above 37,000, and...to a numerical Malay population of more than 80,000!\\". By 1879, the Chinese controlled all steam-powered rice mills in Thailand. Most of the leading businessmen in Thailand were of Chinese extraction and accounted for a significant portion of the Thai upper class. In 1890, despite British shipping dominance in Bangkok, the Chinese oversaw 62 percent of the shipping sector and served as agents for Western shipping firms as well as their own. They also dominated the rubber industry, market gardening, sugar production, and fish exporting sectors. In Bangkok, Thai Chinese dominated the entertainment and media industries, being the pioneers of Thailand's early publishing houses, newspapers, and film studios. Thai Chinese moneylenders wielded considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous Thai peasants, prompting accusations of Chinese bribery of government officials, wars between the Chinese secret societies, and the use of violent tactics to collect taxes. Chinese success served to foster Thai resentment against the Chinese at a time when their community was expanding rapidly. Waves of Han Chinese immigration swept into Siam in the 19th and early-20th centuries, peaking in the 1920s. Whereas Chinese bankers were accused of plunging the Thai peasant into poverty by charging high interest rates, the reality was that the Thai banking business was highly competitive. Chinese millers and rice traders were blamed for the economic recession that gripped Siam for nearly a decade after 1905. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Chinese would lose control of foreign trade to the European colonial powers, but served as compradores for Western trading houses. Ethnic Chinese then moved into extractive industries‚Äîtin mining, logging and sawmilling, rice milling, as well as building ports and railways. While acknowledged for their industriousness, the Chinese in Thailand were scorned by many. In the late 19th century, a British official in Siam declared that \\"the Chinese are the Jews of Siam ... by judicious use of their business faculties and their powers of combination, they hold the Siamese in the palm of their hand\\". =20th century= By the early 20th century, the resident Chinese community in Bangkok was sizable, consisting of perhaps a third of the capital's population. Anti-Chinese sentiment was rife. In 1914, the Thai nationalist King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), published a pamphlet in Thai and English‚ÄîThe Jews of the East‚Äî employing a pseudonym. In it, he lambasted the Chinese. He described them as \\"avaricious barbarians who were 'entirely devoid of morals and mercy'\\". He depicted successful Chinese businessmen as gaining their success at the expense of indigenous Thais, prompting some Thai politicians to blame Thai Chinese businessmen for Thailand's economic difficulties. King Vajiravudh's views were influential among elite Thais and were quickly adopted by ordinary Thais, fueling their suspicion of and hostility to the Chinese minority. Wealth disparity and the poverty of native Thais resulted in blaming their socioeconomic ills on the Chinese, especially Chinese moneylenders. Beginning in the late-1930s and recommencing in the 1950s, the Thai government dealt with wealth disparities by pursuing a campaign of forced assimilation achieved through property confiscation, forced expropriation, coercive social policies, and anti-Chinese cultural suppression, seeking to eradicate ethnic Han Chinese consciousness and identity. Thai Chinese became the targets of state discrimination while indigenous Thais were granted economic privileges. The Siamese revolution of 1932 only tightened the grip of Thai nationalism, culminating in World War II when Thailand's Japanese ally was at war with China. Bangkok, Thailand's financial center and business networking hub Postwar Thailand was an agrarian economy hobbled by state-owned enterprises. The Chinese provided the impetus for Thailand's industrialization, transforming the Thai economy into an export-oriented, trade-based economy with global reach. Over the next several decades, internationalization and capitalist market-oriented policies led to the emergence of a manufacturing sector, which in turn catapulted Thailand into a Tiger Cub economy. Virtually all manufacturing and import-export firms were Chinese controlled. Despite their small numbers, the Chinese controlled virtually every line of business, from small retail trade to large industries. A mere ten percent of the population, ethnic Chinese dominate over four-fifths of the country's rice, tin, rubber, and timber exports, and virtually the country's entire wholesale and retail trade. Virtually all new manufacturing establishments were Chinese controlled. Despite failed Thai affirmative action-based policies in the 1930s to economically empower the indigenous Thai majority, 70 percent of retail outlets and 80‚Äì90 percent of rice mills were controlled by ethnic Chinese. A survey of Thailand's roughly seventy most powerful business groups found that all but three were owned by Thai Chinese. Bangkok's Thai Chinese clan associations rose to prominence throughout the city as the clans are major property holders. The Chinese control more than 80 percent of public companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. All the residential and commercial land in central Siam was owned by Thai Chinese. Fifty ethnic Chinese families controlled the country's entire business sectors equivalent to 81‚Äì90 percent of the overall market capitalization of the Thai economy. Highly publicized profiles of wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs attracted great public interest and were used to illustrate the community's economic clout. More than 80 percent of the top 40 richest people in Thailand are Thai of full or partial Chinese descent. Thai Chinese entrepreneurs are influential in real estate, agriculture, banking, and finance, and the wholesale trading industries. In the 1990s, among the top ten Thai businesses in terms of sales, nine of them were Chinese-owned with only Siam Cement not being a Chinese- owned firm. Of the five billionaires in Thailand in the late-20th century, all were all ethnic Chinese or of partial Chinese descent. On 17 March 2012, Chaleo Yoovidhya, of humble Chinese origin, died while listed on Forbes list of billionaires as 205th in the world and third in the nation, with an estimated net worth of US$5 billion. By the late-1950s, ethnic Chinese comprised 70 percent of Bangkok's business owners and senior business managers, and 90 percent of the shares in Thai corporations were said to be held by Thais of Chinese extraction. Ninety percent of Thailand's industrial and commercial capital are also held by ethnic Chinese. Ninety percent of all investments in the industry and commercial sector and at least 50 percent of all investments in the banking and finance sectors is controlled by ethnic Chinese. Economic advantages would also persist as Thai Chinese controlled 80‚Äì90 percent of the rice mills, the largest enterprises in the nation. Thailand's lack of an indigenous Thai commercial culture in the private sector is dominated entirely by Thai Chinese themselves. Of the 25 leading entrepreneurs in the Thai business sector, 23 are ethnic Chinese or of partial Chinese descent. Thai Chinese also comprise 96 percent of Thailand's 70 most powerful business groups. Family firms are extremely common in the Thai business sector as they are passed down from one generation to the next. Ninety percent of Thailand's manufacturing sector and 50 percent of Thailand's service sector is controlled by ethnic Chinese. According to a Financial Statistics of the 500 Largest Public Companies in Asia Controlled by Overseas Chinese in 1994 chart released by Singaporean geographer Dr. Henry Yeung of the National University of Singapore, 39 companies were concentrated in Thailand with a market capitalization of US$35 billion and total assets of US$94 billion. In Thailand, ethnic Chinese control the nations largest private banks: Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank, Bank of Ayudhya. Thai Chinese businesses are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of Overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family, ethnic, language, and cultural ties. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, structural reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Indonesia and Thailand led to the loss of many monopolistic positions long held by the ethnic Chinese business elite. Despite the financial and economic crisis, Thai Chinese are estimated to own 65 percent of the total banking assets, 60 percent of the national trade, 90 percent of all local investments in the commercial sector, 90 percent of all local investments in the manufacturing sector, and 50 percent of all local investments in the banking and financial services sector. =21st century= The early-21st century saw Thai Chinese dominate Thai commerce at every level of society. Their economic clout plays a critical role in maintaining the country's economic vitality and prosperity. The economic power of the Thai Chinese is far greater than their proportion of the population would suggest. With their powerful economic presence, the Chinese dominate the country's wealthy elite. Development policies imposed by the Thai government provided business opportunities for the ethnic Chinese. A distinct Sino-Thai business community has emerged as the dominant economic group, controlling virtually all the major business sectors across the country. The modern Thai business sector is highly dependent on ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs and investors who control virtually all the country's banks and large conglomerates; their support is enhanced by the presence of lawmakers and politicians who are of at least part-Chinese descent. The Thai Chinese, a disproportionate wealthy, market-dominant minority not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economically advantaged social class. With the rise of China as a global economic power, Thai-Chinese businesses have become the foremost, largest investors in Mainland China among all overseas Chinese communities worldwide. Many Thai Chinese have sent their children to newly established Chinese language schools, visit China in record numbers, invest in China, and assume Chinese surnames. The Charoen Pokphand (CP Group), a prominent Thai conglomerate founded by the Thai-Chinese Chearavanont family, has been the single largest foreign investor in China. CP Group also owns and operates Tesco Lotus, one of the largest foreign hypermarkets, 74 stores and seven distribution centers in 30 cities across China. According to Thai historian, Dr. Wasana Wongsurawa, the Thai elite has remained in power by employing a simple two-part strategy: first, secure the economic base by cultivating the support of the Thai-Chinese business elites; second, align with the dominant world power of the day. , increasingly, that power is China.  Religion  A Chinese temple in Bangkok First-generation Chinese immigrants were followers of Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Theravada Buddhism has since become the religion of many ethnic Chinese in Thailand, especially among assimilated Chinese. Many Chinese in Thailand commonly combine practices of Chinese folk religion with Theravada Buddhism. Major Chinese festivals such as Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival and Qingming are widely celebrated, especially in Bangkok, Phuket, and other parts of Thailand where there are large Chinese populations. The Peranakans in Phuket are noted for their nine- day vegetarian festival between September and October. During the festive season, devotees will abstain from meat and mortification of the flesh by Chinese mediums are also commonly seen, and the rites and rituals seen are devoted to the veneration of Tua Pek Kong. Such idiosyncratic traditions were developed during the 19th century in Phuket by the local Chinese with influences from Thai culture. In the north, there is a small minority of Chinese people who traditionally practice Islam. They belong to a group of Chinese people, known as Chin Ho. Most of the Chinese Muslims are descended from Hui people who live in Yunnan, China. There are seven Chinese mosques in Chiang Mai. The best known is the Ban Ho Mosque.  Dialect groups  The vast majority of Thai Chinese belong to various southern Chinese dialect groups. Of these, 56 percent are Teochew (also commonly spelled as Teochiu), 16 percent Hakka and 11 percent Hainanese. The Cantonese and Hokkien each constitute seven percent of the Chinese population, and three percent belong to other Chinese dialect groups. A large number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between Chinese immigrants and Thais, while there are others who are of predominantly or solely of Chinese descent. People who are of mainly Chinese descent are descendants of immigrants who relocated to Thailand as well as other parts of Nanyang (the Chinese term for Southeast Asia used at the time) in the early to mid-20th century due to famine and civil war in the southern Chinese provinces of Hainan (Hainanese), Guangdong (Teochew, Cantonese, and Hakka groups) and Fujian (Hokkien, Henghua, Hockchew and Hakka groups). =Teochew= The Teochews mainly settled near the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. Many of them worked in the government, while others were involved in trade. During the reign of King Taksin, some influential Teochew traders were granted certain privileges. These prominent traders were called \\"royal Chinese\\" (Jin-luang or ‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á in Thai). =Hakka= Hakkas are mainly concentrated in Chiang Mai, Phuket, and central western provinces. The Hakka own many private banks in Thailand, notably Kasikorn Bank and Kiatnakin Bank. =Hainanese= Hainanese people are mainly concentrated in Bangkok, Samui, and some central provinces. Some notable Hainanese Thai families includes the Chirathivat family of Central Group and Yoovidhya family of Krating Daeng. =Cantonese= Cantonese people are not very prominent but mainly concentrated in Bangkok and the central provinces. Most of them trace their ancestry to Âè∞Â±±, Êñ∞‰ºö and ÂπøÂ∑û. One of the largest construction companies, Sino- Thai Engineering & Construction Public Company Limited, in Thailand is run by a Thai Cantonese family founded in 1962 by Chavarat Charnvirakul ÈôàÊôØÈïá. His son, Anutin Charnvirakul, is the current Minister for Public Health in Thailand. The well known Farm Chokchai and the Chokchai milk brand in Thailand are owned by a Cantonese family, the Bulakul family. =Hokkien= The Hokkiens are a dominant group of Chinese particularly in the south of Thailand; they primarily live in Trang Province and Phuket Province, respectively. A smaller Hokkien community can also be found in Hatyai in Songkhla Province. =Hokchew= The Hokchew is minor community in Phuket. Some ethnic Chinese living in the Malay-dominated provinces in the far south use Malay, rather than Thai as a lingua franca, and many have intermarried with local Malays. =Peranakan= In Phuket Province, the assimilated group is known as Peranakans or Phuket Baba. These people share a similar culture and identity with the Peranakan Chinese in neighboring Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. = Linguistic concentrations = *Teochew *Hokkien *Cantonese *Hakka *Hainanese *Hokchew *Southwestern Mandarin  Family Names  Almost all Thai- Chinese or Sino-Thais, especially those who came to Thailand before the 1950s, only use Thai surname in public, as was required by King Rama VI as a condition of Thai citizenship. The few who retain native Chinese surnames are either recent immigrants or resident aliens. For some immigrants who settled in Southern Thailand before the 1950s, it was common to simply prefix Sae- (from Chinese: , 'family name') to a transliteration of their name to form the new family name; Wanlop Sae-Chio's last name thus derived from the Hainanese and Chanin Sae-ear's last name is from Hokkien . Sae is also used by Hmong people in Thailand. In 1950s-1970s no Chinese immigrant in Thailand, thus Chinese people who immigrated after the 1970s use their Chinese family names without Sae- therefore these people didn't recognize as Sino-Thais like Thai celebrity, Thassapak Hsu's last name is Mandarin's surname . Sino-Thai surnames are often distinct from those of the other-Thai population, with generally longer names mimicking those of high officials and upper-class ThaisMirin MacCarthy. \\"Successfully Yours: Thanet Supornsaharungsi.\\" Pattaya Mail. [Undated] 1998. and with elements of these longer names retaining their original Chinese family name in translation or transliteration. For example, former Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's unusual Archa element is a translation into Thai of his family's former name Ma (trad. È¶¨, simp. È©¨, lit. 'horse'). Similarly, the Lim in Sondhi Limthongkul's name is the Hainanese pronunciation of the name Lin (Êûó). For an example, see the background of the Vejjajiva Palace name. Note that the latter-day Royal Thai General System of Transcription would transcribe it as Wetchachiwa and that the Sanskrit-derived name refers to 'medical profession'. Prime Ministers of Chinese descent Most prime ministers of Thailand have been multiracial, with most having been of at least partial Chinese ancestry. Those included are Kon Hutasingha,Preston et al. (1997), p. 464; 51. Phya Manopakarana Nitidhada spoke perfect English and was always very friendly to England. He is three parts Chinese. His wife, a favorite lady-in-waiting to the ex-Queen, was killed in a motor accident in 1929 when on an official visit to Indo-China.

Early years Coveney was born in Tracton, County Cork, Irish Free State,Diocese of Cork & Ross studied at Maynooth College (obtaining the academic degree of Bachelor of Arts in classical languages and literature), and the Pontifical Irish College, Rome, Italy (obtaining the Licentiate of Sacred Theology), and was ordained, aged twenty-four, as a priest on 21 February 1959 by the archbishop vicegerent (deputy vicar general of Rome) Luigi Traglia in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. After doing parish work in Kidlington, England, he taught in the minor seminary of the Diocese of Cork and Ross in Cork from 1960 to 1966. When use of the vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the Roman Rite Mass, he edited a lectionary in English.Missal Lectionary (Cork, 1965) In September 1966 he went to work in the English-language section of the Secretariat of State in the Vatican.In Our Time (MG Publications, March 2009), p. 30 This sometimes involved acting as interpreter at audiences of Pope Paul VI, as when this Pope received the three astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission that first landed human beings on the Moon.Coveney appears on the right of this photograph of the meeting between the Pope and the three astronauts. At the Pontifical Lateran University he obtained the degree of Doctor of Canon Law in 1969. Diplomatic service To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1969 and entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1971. He served with the rank of Secretary in the Apostolic Nunciature in Buenos Aires from 1972 to 1976, returning then to the Secretariat of State in the Vatican. He was counselor of the nunciatures in New Delhi (1982‚Äì1984) and Khartoum (1984‚Äì1985). On 27 July 1985 he was appointed titular Archbishop of Satrianum and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Zimbabwe and Apostolic Delegate to Mozambique.Annuario Pontificio 1986, p. 848 He was ordained to the episcopate on 15 September 1985 in the cathedral of St Mary and St Anne, Cork.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a large, sweeping bay on the English Channel coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, stretching from the Lizard Point to Gwennap Head. In the north of the bay, near Marazion, is St Michael's Mount; the origin of name of the bay.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End In summer, it is a large, benign, scenic, natural harbour. However, in winter, onshore gales present maritime risks, particularly for sailing ships. There are more than 150 known wrecks from the nineteenth century in the area.Corin, J and Farr, G. (1983) Penlee Lifeboat. Penzance: Penzance and Penlee Branch of the RNLI. The eastern side of the bay centred around Marazion and St Michael's Mount was designated as a Marine Conservation Zone in January 2016. Geography and geology Mount's Bay is the biggest bay in Cornwall. Its half-moon shape is similar to that of Donegal Bay in Ireland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, although, unlike the aforementioned bays, Mount's Bay is relatively sheltered from the prevailing Atlantic westerlies. However, it is a danger to shipping during onshore southerly and south-easterly gales. The coast is about from Lizard Point to Gwennap Head.http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/walks_content/distanceCalculator.cfm Heading north and west from Lizard Point, the serpentine and hornblende schist cliffs reach a maximum height of 71 m (233 ft) at Vellan Head and are only broken by small streams and coves such as at Kynance, Gew-grade and Mullion Cove.Lawman, J. (1994) A Natural History of the Lizard Peninsula. Pool: Institute of Cornish Studies. After Gunwalloe Fishing Cove the cliffs have the softer look of Devonian Meneage Formations of greywacke and m√©lange, with erosion a problem either side of the naturally dammed ria of Loe Pool. West of Porthleven there are high Devonian slate and granite cliffs to Rinsey Head after which the cliffs are topped by Pleistocene periglacial head and have eroded to form sandy beaches such as those at Praa Sands and Kenneggy. These beaches are in deficit and the cliff line is retreating.http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/geomincentre/02MOUNTS%20BAY.pdf With the exception of the harder Devonian dolerite and gabbro of Cudden Point, the low, eroding cliffs and beaches continue to Mousehole. This part of the bay is the most populated with the towns of Penzance and Marazion and the villages of Newlyn and Mousehole. Beyond Mousehole the granite cliffs, rise to 60 m, and are broken by small streams such as at Lamorna Cove and Penberth. There are small sand dune systems at Church Cove and Poldhu Cove, Porthleven Sands, Praa Sands and from Marazion to Eastern Green, Penzance. The former sand dunes of the Western Green are now covered by Penzance promenade. All, but Marazion to Penzance, are examples of bay dune systems which develop where there is a limited supply of sand trapped within the shelter of two rocky headlands. Church and Poldhu Coves are SSSIhttp://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000125.pdf and also have associated climbing dunes which occur when sand is blown inland of the main dune system.Tonkin, B., Covey, R. and Moat T. (1997) Start Point to Land‚Äôs End Maritime Natural Area. A Nature Conservation Profile. Truro: English Nature. Evidence of higher sea-levels in the past can be seen at Marazion where the town is built on a raised beach. A second example is the road between Newlyn and Mousehole. Sea levels rise and fall as the ice sheets advance and retreat, and raised beaches now mark the interglacial periods when sea levels were higher. Either side of Penzance, on the beaches at Ponsandane and Wherrytown, evidence of a 'submerged forest' can be seen at low tide in the form of several fossilised tree trunks.Pool, P. A. S. (1974) The History of the Town and Borough of Penzance. Penzance: The Corporation of Penzance. Gwavas Lake is an area of relatively calm water that is situated outside the current harbour area of Newlyn.Ordnance Survey Explorer 7; Land's End, Penzance and St. Ives, 1:25 000 scale. 1996 The natural protection afforded by the Gwavas Lake (an area of seawater in Mount's Bay) led to many Newlyn fishermen using this area as a preferred landing site.. =Post-ice age= Offshore surveys have found submerged erosional plains and valleys containing deposits of peat, sand and gravel. The deposits indicate cyclical changes from wetland, to coastal forest, to brackish conditions have been occurring over the past 12,000 years as sea levels rose. With the melting of ice-sheets and glaciers after the last ice age, sea levels reached their present levels about 6,000 years ago during what is known as the Flandrian Marine Trangression. Either side of Penzance, on the beaches at Ponsandane and Wherrytown, evidence of a 'submerged forest' can be seen at low tide in the form of several partially fossilised tree trunks. Divers and trawlers also find submerged tree trunks across Mount's Bay and the forest may have covered a coastal plain 2 to 5 kilometres further south than today. The samples of peat and wood around Penzance have been radiocarbon dated and indicate that the forest was growing from at least 6,000 to around 4,000 years ago when rising sea levels finally killed the trees. Artefacts dating from the Mesolithic (10,000 to 5,000 BCE) have been found indicating some occupation contemporary with the forest. Marshes formed and were overlain by sand, gravel and by sand dunes which formed natural barriers to the sea. Storms sometimes destroyed the barriers depositing sand and gravel over peat beds in Marazion Marsh, and in the foundations of many buildings in Wherrytown and Long Rock. The remains of these natural barriers can still be seen at Eastern Green and the dunes to the seaward of Marazion Marsh. The submerged forest in the intertidal area between Wherrytown and Long Rock is of national importance and is a Cornwall Geology Site. At Loe Pool a barrier dammed the ria of the River Cober causing the formation of Cornwall's largest lake. Very little of the Loe Bar shingle is locally derived (compared with nearby Gunwalloe beach material to the south) and the deposits have been tentatively dated as Eocene. The composition of the bar deposits are: chalk flint 86%, quartz 9%, grit 2.6%, greensand chert 2% and serpentine 0.5%.Murphy, R.J., (1986). A Study of Loe Bar. In Cornish Studies 14:23‚Äì33. The shingle coming from drowned terraces of the former river that flowed down the English Channel; the nearest onshore source is away in East Devon. Longshore drift is unlikely to have caused the formation because the bar is situated between two headlands but it plays an important part in the maintenance of the bar, with a strong current flowing to the south-east from Porthleven to Gunwalloe, depositing shingle along the bar. The ebb flow is not a simple reverse flow and is not strong enough to remove all the deposits.May, V.J. Loe Bar. In May, V.J. and Hansom, J.D. (2003) Coastal Geomorphology of Great Britain, Geological Conservation Review Series, No 28, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Peterborough, 754 pp.* =Marine Conservation Zone= The Mounts Bay Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) was designated on 29 January 2016 and covers an area of Mount's Bay south of the coast from Long Rock to Cudden Point. The 12 km¬≤ site includes the sea around St Michael's Mount and tidal reefs such as the Greeb, near Perranuthnoe, and the Long Rock. The MCZ protects habitats ranging from exposed high-energy rock on the coast to sand and muddy sand on the sea floor. The seagrass beds, Zostera marina, mainly grow in the sub-tidal zone and are important as a nursery area for fish and shellfish, as well as a feeding area for birds. Damage from the anchors and chains from moored boats can damage the beds. Animals within the zone include stalked jellyfish such as Lucernariopsis campanulata and Lucernariopsis cruxmelitensis, and a fish the giant goby (Gobius cobitis). On 19 August 2018, a white harbour porpoise was seen near Mount's Bay. History =Spanish attack= A Spanish raid took place over two days in August 1595 during the Anglo-Spanish war of 1585‚Äì1604. It was conducted by a Spanish naval squadron led by Carlos de Am√©squita on patrol from Brittany. They landed, sacked and burned Newlyn, Mousehole, Penzance and Paul. A militia force led by Francis Godolphin was unable to drive the Spanish away. =Pirate attacks= In August 1625 \\"Turks took out of the church of Munigesca in Mount's Bay about sixty men, women and children and carried them away captives\\". Slavery in the Ottoman Empire and the Barbary slave trade was fundamental to its economy. The Barbary Pirates were then raiding Europe and they took more than a million Europeans off to the slave markets of Tripoli and elsewhere. =1755 tsunami= On 1 November 1755, the Lisbon earthquake caused a tsunami to strike the Cornish coast at around 14:00. At Mount's Bay the sea rose at great speed and ebbed at the same rate. Settlements There are several coastal towns and villages dotted around Mount's Bay of which the largest is Penzance. To the west are Newlyn, Paul, Mousehole and Lamorna, and to the east are Marazion, Perranuthnoe, Praa Sands, Porthleven and Mullion. The bay also incorporates many beaches, coves and features including Prussia Cove, Loe Pool (and Loe Bar), Church Cove, Poldhu Cove and Kynance Cove. In the churchyard wall of the church of St. Paul Aurelian in Paul is the 1860 monument to Dolly Pentreath, according to tradition the last native speaker of the Cornish language. Mount's Bay gives its name to a local secondary school, which is located in Heamoor and serves Penzance and the surrounding countryside, Mounts Bay Academy. Industry A number of mines were established along the shore and at least three were below the high water mark. An elvan dyke, rich in tin, runs nearly parallel with the Penzance promenade, at about from the shore. According to folklore, numerous veins of nearly pure cassiterite were worked by the ‚Ä≥old men‚Ä≥ in the early 18th-century. Over three summers, from 1778 Thomas Curtis sank a shaft on the Wherrytown reef and then built a 20-foot high wooden tower with a dressed stone breakwater at the base. In 1790, ¬£600 worth of tin was produced by ten men and in 1792, the tin was worth ¬£3000. By 1798, ¬£70,000 worth of the tin was sold. In this year an American ship is said to have demolished the tower and machinery, during a storm and the mine closed. An 1823 attempt at reopening failed as did another in 1836 when a 40-inch cylinder engine was erected on the shore and sold by auction, four years later in 1840. While not as rich in tin as the Wherrytown reef the Long Rock reef produced tin between 1819 and 1823. A lode containing needle antimony, copper, tin and mundic crosses the reef from east to west, and an argentiferous lead lode ran along the reef from north to south. Sir Arthur Russell, a leading mineralogist and mining historian A. K. Hamilton Jenkin visited the reef in the summer of 1956 and found a roughly circular depression in the rock, surrounded by large blocks of elvan which were intended for the breakwater around the shaft. A line of stones known as ‚Ä≥Parson's (Pascoe's) Row‚Ä≥ extends to the shore and would have probably supported the timbers of a pier, which would have carried the flat-rods from the onshore engine. A cutting excavated along the length of the lode indicates the removal of part of the lode.

Location and description The plateau is approximately 100 km east‚Äìwest and the north‚Äìsouth distance is about 130 km. Extensive ignimbrite sheets spread east and west of the Taupo Volcanic Zone centred on the huge dormant supervolcanic caldera Lake Taupo, the largest lake in New Zealand, which last erupted 2000 years ago. The volcanic area includes the three active peaks of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe, and Mount Ruapehu in the south, and extends beyond Rotorua in the north reaching almost to the Bay of Plenty coast. North of Tongariro is the volcanic Mount Pihanga. The western boundary of the plateau forms an escarpment beside the Mamaku and Kaimai Ranges, but further south is less distinct. In the east, the plateau runs up to the foot of the Ahimanawa, Kaweka and the fertile Kaimanawa mountain ranges. Finally, west of the plateau stands the volcano Mount Taranaki (in Egmont National Park). Two of the country's longest rivers, the Whanganui and the Waikato have their headwaters on the plateau. =Geology= The tallest mountain, Ruapehu, is an andesite cone that was once twice as high but has been eroded. All of the cones are composite stratovolcanoes made up of layers of lava and tephra. They are in the intermediate category, meaning that they have a moderate amount of silica in the magma. The percentage of silica is the deciding factor in the thickness or viscosity of the lava. This contrasts with ignimbrite which is a gas-rich material ejected from the ground at high speed forming a giant white hot fountain 55 kilometres high. When the ignimbrite falls it flows outwards at high speed (600‚Äì900 km/h) and can travel many kilometres, even going up and over hills and mountains before it cools, trapping air inside. Especially around Lake Taupo the eroded ignimbrite includes pieces of pumice, a lightweight rock that floats on water. The top, unwelded layer of the ignimbrite sheet is relatively soft and easily eroded by streams and rivers, which transport the pumice to the lake. The lower, welded layers of the ignimbrite sheets are more dense, though still porous. These lower compressed layers often show the glint of heated silicon specks. This stone, called Hinuera stone (after the quarry of origin), is used for building cladding. The ring plain around the central volcanoes is formed from numerous lahars or mudflows that occur when either the crater lake water is ejected from Ruapehu or snow is melted, during an eruption. The water runs down the mountain, picking up ash, lapilli, blocks and bombs as well as previously eroded rock, forming a thick, dense mud that is capable of picking up car- sized rocks. An old lahar flow is visible from the approach road to Whakapapa ski field. In December 1953 a sudden lahar at night on Mt Ruapehu knocked out the rail bridge at Tangiwai, causing six carriages of the Wellington-Auckland express to plunge into the Whangaehu River, killing 151 people. The last major eruption in the area was the Hatepe eruption from the Lake Taupo volcanic complex 1800 years ago, which ejected lava and especially wind-blown tephra over a wide area to the north and northeast of the North Island. About of material was ejected in the space of a few minutes, in the biggest volcanic event in the world in the last 5,000 years. The entire area is above 300 metres, with a considerable proportion of it more than 800 metres above sea level. The plateau has a mild climate although the temperature regularly falls below freezing in winter and snow can fall between March and October. Of all North Island regions, the Volcanic Plateau is closest to having a continental climate.Malcolm McKinnon The period of maximum snow is July to September. Sudden blizzard conditions can be experienced on the volcanoes in winter. These blizzards have killed climbers as recently as the 1980s. The Desert Road on State Highway 1 is often closed by snow in winter for brief periods. Flora The natural vegetation of the area includes the podocarp conifers including rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum), miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea), matai (Prumnopitys taxifolia), totara (Podocarpus totara) and kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) and hardwoods that once covered this whole area before the eruption of Taupo and other volcanoes. To the west of the three large volcanoes, the land is rough forested hill country, while the north close to Lake Taupo is more fertile and undulating and much has been cleared for farming. The forest used to extend to the west coast and there are still patches of natural vegetation in wetlands including the Horowhenua floodplains. However to the east of Taupo the barren, ash-laden soils and harsh alpine climate leave the high land largely bare and unprofitable, capable of growing only scrubby plants. This area is known as the Rangipo Desert although it is not a true desert as the annual rainfall is over 1,000mm PA and the real reason for the low and sparse vegetation was the mass sterilization of seeds caused by the 20,000-year-old Taupo eruption, which swept white-hot ignimbrite through this valley. Prior to this cataclysmic event this area was forested and stumps of charcoalized trees can be seen where soil has eroded. Around Taupo itself there are geothermal areas with specialised plant life such as the prostrate kanuka (a subspecies of kunzea ericoides). Further to the east of the plateau lies more rough hill country in the Kaimanawa Ranges, a popular hunting area for wild red and sika deer. The tops of the mountains are open and tussock covered. Helicopters and light aircraft can land on a rough air strip. Hunting range in the bush is often 50 m or less but in the open tops the range can be much further. The area to the south, around Lake Moawhango is richer in plant life. Finally there are areas of beech forest and alpine vegetation at higher elevations throughout the region. Fauna The northern side of the plateau especially is home to wildlife including birds such as the North Island k≈çkako wattlebird (Callaeas wilsoni), New Zealand kaka, and large populations of brown kiwi (Apteryx australis) and blue duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos). The area to the south of the plateau and down to Wellington is home to a variety of lizards including Whitaker's skink (Cyclodina whitakeri), forest gecko (Hoplodactylus granulatus) and Wellington green gecko (Naultinus elegens punctatus). Wetlands throughout the region support waterbirds and fish including the endemic brown mudfish. Threats and preservation The lowland areas are quite highly populated and therefore urban development, agriculture and forestry are a major threat to natural habitats there. One block of lowland forest remains in and around Whanganui National Park and large areas of the uplands are protected either by Maori tradition or in national parks of which Te Urewera is the largest. The four North Island national parks, which surround the plateau, are Te Urewera, Whanganui, Egmont and New Zealand's first national park, the World Heritage listed Tongariro National Park. Introduced species and livestock grazing are now major threats to some endemic species. Rats, cats and stoats prey on native reptiles and birds (including the kokako, blue duck and brown kiwi), while imported plants such as old man's beard, banana passionfruit and gorse can take over from indigenous species. Finally grazing by goats and possums can eradicate others such as kamahi, kaikawaka (Libocedrus bidwillii) and mountain t≈çtara. Therefore, smaller islands off the coast of Wellington have been used as a refuge for North Island birds and reptiles whose habitats may be threatened now or in the future. Also the Volcanic Plateau region has the largest area of man made forest in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all the trees are Pinus radiata which were bought in for trials at Rotorua in 1899 from Kew Gardens, London. The tree, a native of Monterey, California, grew very fast in the poor soils. Mass planting was initially carried out by prisoners in the 1920s and then by the unemployed on a large scale during the Great Depression. After World War II scientists from Norway settled in the region and helped develop ways of treating the soft pine to prevent rotting using pressure treatment with chemicals. They also introduced selective breeding methods which was the standard way of improving the trees until tissue culture was introduced in the 1990s. Trees take 25‚Äì30 years to reach full height. Most plantations use growth factor (GF) trees to guarantee very high quality (straight and knot-free) timber, however treatment by chemical salts is still required to stop rotting. This is done by either dipping or more usually, pressure treatment. New Zealand has pioneered the use of Radiata timber and plywood in small craft boatbuilding. Untreated clear timber or plywood is used that is then encapsulated in epoxy resin after construction. The key reason is the low cost of the wood rather than any inherent properties of the wood which is of moderate weight but fractures easily when bent, when dried to 12% moisture. One of the largest ply factories in New Zealand is located on the Volcanic Plateau at Tokoroa. Although planting by hand is still done on steeper land, most seedlings are now planted with the help of machines. Urban areas in the region include the towns of Taihape in the south, Ohakune the carrot-growing capital of NZ in the west, and Taupo in the north, with Turangi a major trout fishing base at the south of Lake Taupo and by the Kaweka Ranges in the east, The majority of the population of the area lives close to the shores of Lake Taupo, with some smaller settlements to the east of the volcanoes. These make their living largely through tourism, including skiing in the winter season, trout fishing, especially on the Tongariro river or by forestry in the plateau's northeast, which includes the Kaingaroa Forest or by working on the extensive Hydro Electric power system. History The MƒÅori population during the Archaic period was sparse. Only two moa hunter period sites have been discovered to date. The best known is the Whakamoenga cave near Taup≈ç. The cave was in use about 600 years ago and three moa bones, obsidian flakes, hollow pumice stone ash holders, pumice floats, a fishing net, bird spears, pieces of hue (gourd) and bracken remains have been found. The other moa hunter site is at Tokoroa.Anne Leahy Study, University of Auckland, 1962/63 The tangata whenua are the NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa. Their paramount chief is Sir Tumu te Heuheu. They moved into this area after splitting away from the Arawa tribe on the east coast. The boundary between Arawa and Tuwharetoa is a small island 400 metres north of Huka Falls on the Waikato River. Their main marae is on the southern shores of Lake Taup≈ç at Waihi near the Tokaanu geothermal area. They still retain ownership of the peaks of the mountains which are considered sacred, as well as the Ketetahi hot springs on the north slope of Mt Tongariro. The MƒÅori people considered the volcanoes sacred and in traditional times wore woven flax eye shields to avoid looking at the peaks. The Rangipo region is largely uninhabited. It is used by the New Zealand Army, based at Waiouru in the south, and by the Rangipo prison farm in the north and Rangipo underground HEP station to the east. During the 1960s The Tongariro power scheme redirected the flow of water from many of the streams and rivers that drain the central peaks. The water was channelled into canals, tunnels and storage lakes to provide water for 2 HEP stations at Rangipo and Tokaanu. The water then flowed into Lake Taup≈ç increasing its input by 20%. Most of the Tongariro river flow is not included in the power scheme due to its importance as a breeding area for brown and rainbow trout. The extra water boosted the amount of water available to the 10 other HEP stations on the Waikato River which flows from the north end of the lake and is its only exit. The productivity of pasture on the plateau was greatly improved in the 1950s once it was realised that the \\"bush sickness\\" suffered by local livestock was due to cobalt deficient volcanic soils. The cure for this was discovered by an Australian scientist in 1936 but the application of cobalt at the rate of 30cc per Ha was only possible after World War II making use of war surplus planes and ex WW2 pilots for aerial topdressing. The cobalt was mixed with crushed phosphate rock which was obtained cheaply from Nauru Island in the West Pacific. The resulting mix was called Super Phosphate. The site is close to Tangiwai, the scene of New Zealand's worst railway disaster on Christmas Eve, 1953, when 151 were killed when the rail bridge was destroyed by a lahar flow from Mt Ruapehu. The largest farm in the North Island was established off the Taup≈ç-Napier road and is called Lochinver Station. The station was largely developed by construction millionaire Bill Stephenson and his family using heavy earthmoving equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. The high country sheep and cattle station has several airstrips, 21 houses and 200 km of roading. It normally carries 100,000 breeding ewes and about 8,000 cattle. It has extensive shelter belts of contorta pine, improved rye-grass pasture and grows crops of swedes and barley. The farm is open to tourist and school group bus tours. Popular culture Tourism is an economic mainstay of the region with a wide range of largely outdoor attractions from trout fishing, flyfishing on Tongariro River or harling on Lake Taupo, tramping, Mountain biking centred on National Park, deer or pig hunting, horse riding to snowskiing/boarding on Mt Ruapehu. The Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre of New Zealand is located on the site of an old Italian tunneling construction camp. Started by mountaineer Graeme Dingle in the 1970s, this centre offers valuable outdoor training experience and skills to secondary school groups and others. Train and engineering enthusiasts will enjoy the Raurimu Spiral. The main trunk rail line spirals upwards 132m via a tunnel and 180-degree hairpin bends so the passengers near the head of the train can see the rear carriages heading in the opposite direction. At the time of construction it was considered a masterpiece of engineering. This was the last stage to be built in the main trunk railway line completed in 1900. =Cold Kiwi Motorcycle Rally= The Cold Kiwi Motorcycle Rally, advertised as NZ's longest running motorcycle rally,, www.coldkiwi.co.nz has been held on the Plateau since 1972.Cold Kiwi , www.kiwibiker.co.nz The event is run by The Ruapehu Motorcycle Club in early Sept each year. Bikers sleep in their own tents despite the average temperature being -8C at night, but the club provides hot food and drinks, a bonfire, as well as competitions, souvenirs, live bands and toilet facilities. The 2016 event will be held from Friday 2 September to Sunday 4 September on a new site at Horopito on the western side of Mt Ruapehu., www.coldkiwi.co.nz =Tongariro Alpine Crossing= The one-day Tongariro Alpine Crossing from the Mangatepopo Valley across Mt Ngauruhoe and Mt Tongariro is named one of the greatest one-day walks in the world by the Department of Conservation. The 19.2 km track is well marked in summer and popular but trampers should be quite fit and well equipped as the route is exposed, especially during the winter months (April to September) when the route poles are sometimes hidden by snow or blown away. There are two well equipped huts near the ends of route. Detailed guidance is available from the Mt Ruapehu Department of Conservation Visitors Centre.

It transmitted on 183 kHz with a power of 2,000 kilowatts a French speaking programme, Europe 1 toward France. It was the highest power radio broadcasting transmitter in Germany. Technical details The transmitter uses directional aerials of four guyed, insulated radio masts which are 270, 276, 280, and 282 metres high. Furthermore, there is a backup aerial, which consists of two guyed insulated radio masts with a height of 234 metres. Due to the strong south- west directional characteristic of the antenna, reception to the northeast of the transmitter (i.e. in the largest part of Germany) is poor or distorted. The building, in which the transmitters are situated, has a length of 82 metres, a width of 43 metres, and a height of 16 metres. Its surface area is 2,700 square metres and its volume 31,000 cubic metres. In front of this building, there is a telecommunication tower, which was used for broadcasting the programme of Telesaar. A new transmitter house with new 2x750 kW transmitter was built in 2015 next to the backup aerial, that was used until the shutdown in 2019. On the morning of 8 August 2012 an 80 meters tall part of the 280 meters high transmitter broke down. This was caused by a ragged guy wire. The damaged mast was demolished on 19 November 2012. Mast 1 was demolished on 13 June 2013, because it was useless without mast 2. partially collapsed mast History The longwave transmitter traces its existence to the special state of the Saar Protectorate in the 1950s: Occupied by France in 1946, the French military authorities allowed the people to organize elections and govern themselves, becoming a Protectorate using the French Franc as money. It was integrated to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 as a compromise between France and Germany, after the Saar people decided by referendum against a \\"special european district\\" status they were proposed. The transmitter was built in 1954, broadcasting since 1 January 1955, on land which is now located inside German borders. In 1959, one of its main masts was relocated to vertical.

Born in Manchester, the son of the elder Samuel Greg, the creator of Quarry Bank Mill, he was brother to William Rathbone Greg and Robert Hyde Greg. Influenced by the religious beliefs of his mother Hannah, he attended a Unitarian school in Nottingham. Further study in Bristol, under Lant Carpenter, and at the University of Edinburgh was interspersed with experience in the family firm and completed by the, then obligatory, Grand Tour. Already more interested in the consequences of wealth rather than its creation, in 1830 and 1831 he gave lectures on scientific subjects to the workers at Quarry Bank. On his father's retirement in 1832, he took over management of Lowerhouse Mill in Bollington, Cheshire and used it as a basis for further social experimentation. He published his ideas on the model factory village in Two Letters to Leonard Horner on the Capabilities of the Factory System (1840) and went on to found a number of educational and social institutions in Bollington. However, in 1847, he introduced new machinery in his mills which was so unpopular that it precipitated a strike. In consequence, Greg suffered from a nervous breakdown and retired to his Bollington home, The Mount. Thereon, he restricted his philanthropy to scientific lectures for the workers of Macclesfield, becoming president of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Greg wrote the hymn Stay, Master, stay,http://www.bartleby.com/294/504.html based on the gospel story of the Transfiguration of Jesus. Greg married Mary Priscilla Needham in 1838 and she bore him two sons and six daughters. He died in Bollington in 1876 after a long illness. Bibliography *Rose, M.B.

The magazine was created in 1986 by Nick Logan, who had started The Face in 1980, to focus on trends in fashion and entertainment. British graphic designer Neville Brody, who had designed The Face, designed Arena's launch appearance. The headquarters of Arena was in London. The magazine was part of Bauer Media and featured articles on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, electronics, and books. It was pitched at a similarly upscale audience to GQ, attempting to offer a more adult read than lad mags like Maxim and FHM, and gearing itself specifically towards the \\"black collar worker\\". Arena launched the careers of several prominent British media professionals, among them Dylan Jones, the editor of GQ UK who had served as Arena's editor in the late 1980s. In July 2006, facing competition from the internet, the editorial team behind Arena launched a team blog which features regular posts from its contributors. In spite of this, magazine circulation continued to fall and in 2007, Giles Hattersley, chief interviewer at The Sunday Times was brought in as Editor. Hattersley oversaw a revamp of the publication and in November 2007, the magazine relaunched with a new design and new palate of content, featuring David Beckham on its cover. Hattersley returned to The Sunday Times in March 2008 and was replaced in the interim by deputy editor Mat Smith. Smith left in August 2008 to take over as features director at Esquire UK. In April 2009 Arena ceased publication. As of April 2009, international editions of Arena outside the UK continued to be published. These editions included Ukraine, Turkey, Korea and Thailand. Arena Singapore, the first English language edition outside the UK, was launched on 27 October 2006 by the publishing division of Mediacorp.

The village website claims the area to have \\"a history steeped in stories of piracy and smugglers\\". Aviation history Eastchurch is styled the \\"home of British aviation\\" as Eastchurch airfield saw the first controlled flight by a British pilot on British soil. The Eastchurch airfield played a significant role in the history of British aviation from 1909 when Frank McClean acquired Stonepits Farm, on the marshes across from Leysdown, converting the land into an airfield for members of the Aero Club of Great Britain. The Short Brothers, Horace, Eustace and Oswald, built aircraft at Battersea to be tested at the site; later Moore- Brabazon, A. K. Huntington, Charles S. Rolls and Cecil Grace all visited and used the flying club's services. Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville came to the Isle of Sheppey to visit the new flying grounds of the Aero Club. In 1909, Moore-Brabazon made the first live cargo flight by fixed-wing aircraft, tying a waste-paper basket to a wing strut of his Shorts-built Wright aircraft. Then, using it as a \\"cargo hold\\", he airlifted one small pig. Memorial to the Home of Aviation in Eastchurch The Eastchurch airfield was also the site, in July 1911, of the competition for the Gordon Bennett Trophy for powered air racing, attended by flyers from all over the world and won that year by the American pilot C. T. Weymann. During the Battle of Britain, it was one of the notable bases of the Polish Air Force. A stained glass window by Karl Parsons in the south side of All Saints' Church, Eastchurch (built in 1432), was dedicated to Rolls and Grace, who were killed in July and December 1910 respectively. The Memorial to the Home of Aviation was unveiled in 1955, in the centre of the village opposite the church. Sculpture on the edge of Eastchurch depicting a Short Brothers biplane, unveiled in July 2009 to mark the centenary of British aviation In July 2009, Eastchurch celebrated 100 years of aviation history associated with the Island. SkySheppey brought together a number of associations and joined with many visitors to recognise the importance of British aviation history which started in Eastchurch. The organisers, the Eastchurch Parish Council, planned the event for 25 and 26 July 2009. Eastchurch is also home to many forms of aircraft and is where they were originally developed in the early 1900s, notably by Short Brothers.Aerial view of Shorts' factory and Eastchurch airfield Buildings The gatehouse is now all that remains of Shurland Hall, connected with many families including the Cheneys who were there in 1274; and Sir John Stanley, who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the 15th century. It was also rumoured to have housed Henry VIII and his wife, Anne Boleyn, for a few nights. For a short period before it was acquired by the Spitalfields Trust in 2006, it was owned by Violet Searle, a business woman who developed an early house within the village in Warden Road. The gatehouse is now in the care of the Spitalfields Trust and in the process of being renovated and restored. Prisons and the village from the air In Hidden Kent by Alan Major (Countryside Books, 1994), there is a note from the 1847 gazetteer commenting on the scarcity of fresh water which \\"makes the inhabitants very careful to preserve such falls from the clouds\\" and tells of spouts from the church designed to fill large tubs around it in the churchyard.

He was a piper, violinist, composer and producer. He was an innovator and his compositions crossed musical and cultural divides. Sporting dreadlocks at the height of his performing career, his energetic displays led to descriptions such as \\"the techno piper\\". Diagnosis of serious illness at the age of thirty curtailed his live performances, although he completed a further two albums in the studio. He died fifteen months after release of his fifth album Grit. Early life He was born Martyn Bennett-Knight in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. His father Ian Knight was a Welsh geologist and musician. His mother was Margaret Bennett, singer and folklorist who was born on Skye. His grandfather, George Bennett, was also an enthusiastic piper. For his first five years, he lived in the Codroy Valley, where Gaelic and traditional music were part of the culture. He was five years old when the family moved to Quebec. His parents separated when he was six and his mother moved back to Scotland, taking him with her. They stayed briefly on Mull, before moving to Kingussie, where he had his first lessons on playing the Great Highland bagpipe from David Taylor, also his history teacher. By the age of twelve, he was winning junior piping competitions. Education At the age of fifteen he moved to Edinburgh with his mother. He won a place at the City of Edinburgh Music School, the first traditional musician to do so. During the three years that he studied there he also learned piano and violin. In 1990 he began at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow, studying violin and piano. where he met Kirsten Thomson, a piano student in the year above who joined him as a band-member, later becoming his wife. During the final year of his studies he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, although he recovered from this illness after six months of treatment, graduating in 1993. Career Bennett was influenced by the early 1990s dance music scene and regularly attended clubs. He worked with Martin Swan‚Äôs Mouth Music project, combining traditional Gaelic songs and music with contemporary instruments. He made his debut at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 14 January 1994 supporting them. Bennett was still a teenager when Swan had first spotted him playing. He released his first album, the eponymous Martyn Bennett, in 1995 on Eclectic, a small Edinburgh-based independent label. He had recorded the album in just seven days at Castle Sound studios in Pencaitland. Floret Silva Undique uses a poem by Hamish Henderson, who commented \\"What brave new music\\". The album had a \\"dramatic\\" impact on Scottish music. He provided the live musical score for David Harrower‚Äôs play Knives in Hens. He performed at the party held at Stirling Castle for the European premier of the movie Braveheart on 3 September 1995. He was back performing in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in January 1996. After writing scores for stage and television, he went on tour to America, supporting Wolfstone. He played at Edinburgh Hogmanay events in 1995 and 1996. He released Bothy Culture in 1998 on the Rykodisc label. One composition Hallaig takes its name from the poem by the Gaelic bard Sorley MacLean, incorporating a sample of MacLean reading the poem. Bothy culture topped the US college radio charts. The album came close to winning a Mercury Music Prize nomination. His performances were also attracting attention. It was unusual for a piper to be sporting dreadlocks, this image fitted with the musical and cultural boundaries that he was crossing. At times he was characterised as \\"the techno piper\\". He played at T in the Park in 1998. Scottish celebrities attended his performance at the Buddha Bar in Paris, ahead of Scotland playing Brazil in the opening match of the 1998 World Cup. He was awarded the 1998 Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award in the music category. He played at Celtic connections again in 1999. At Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations at the millennium, his band Cuillin played at the Castle Esplanade, supporting Texas. In 1999 he moved to Mull, where he met Dundonian musical Martin Low who helped him with his next work. Rykodisc had now become part of Palm Pictures. In 2000 he released the album Hardland on his own Cuillin label. He appeared at the Cambridge Folk Festival in 2000, giving an electrifying performance. A reviewer wrote in Mojo that \\"Scots music has never sounded like this before. No music has ever sounded like this before. Half the audience fled in fear of their lives.\\" Bennett sold a thousand CDs after the set. The City of Edinburgh Music School commissioned him to write Mackay's Memoirs for the school's centenary in 1999. It was a piece for chamber orchestra featuring Great Highland bagpipes and harp. Mackay's Memoirs was played at the celebrations that took place in Princes Street Gardens, alongside the opening of the new Scottish Parliament in July 1999 and at the 2004 M√≤d He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2000. Over the following eight month he received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the following years his treatments would also include several major operations. After this diagnosis, he recorded his fourth album Glen Lyon which was first released on the Foot Stomping' label in 2002. It was a cycle of Gaelic songs, his mother singing and him accompanying her. Woven into this is a sample of Peter Stewart, his great-great-grandfather singing in 1910, taken from a wax cylinder recording. He married Kirsten in February 2002. Following a relapse and an unexpected splenectomy in January of that year, Bennett proposed; the ceremony took place in her mother's kitchen. The couple moved back to Mull. Illness left him feeling disconnected from his music and one day, in a fit of rage, he destroyed many of his instruments‚àí pipes, fiddles and whistles. Horrified at what he had done, he was unable to bring himself to speak to anyone for the following two days. The final album that he recorded, Grit, was released in October 2003 on Real World Records. It had been recorded while he was ill, and he was unable to play his instruments. He brought together samples of unaccompanied traditional Scottish folk singers, his own bagpipe and fiddle playing, with and electronic drum beats. For the opening track, Move he sampled a recording of traditional singer Sheila Stewart performing the Moving On Song, Ewan MacColl‚Äôs song about travellers; she was delighted that he was taking it to a new audience. His song Liberation featured Michael Marra narrating an English translation of psalm 118. The album has been \\"credited with starting the musical evolution of Celtic fusion\\". On 10 December 2003 BBC Two Scotland aired an ArtWorks Scotland documentary Martyn Bennett: Grit. Death and legacy Bennett died at the Marie Curie Hospice, Edinburgh from cancer on 30 January 2005, aged 33. News of his death spread among revellers attending the last night of Celtic Connections. The news was held back from the Edinburgh Music School pupils who were recording Mackay's memoirs the following day. His funeral was held on Mull. A memorial concert was held at The Queen's Hall, Edinburgh on 15 April. Around the same time the Martyn Bennett Trust was set up by his family and friends, as a commemorative fund to help young musicians. The 2006 Celtic Connections programme included a Martyn Bennet Day, held on 14 January, with events to celebrate his work. Toccata for Small Hands, written by Bennett for Kirsten, was performed in public for the first time. Greg Lawson was commissioned to score an arrangement of Liberation. Cuillin Music reformed to perform at the event. After Bennett's death, the band preferred to rework material instead of reproducing it. In June 2006, a book It's Not the Time You Have ‚Ä¶ was launched which contained recollections of Bennett, compiled by his mother. On 27 October 2007, an event was held at The Queen's Hall. This event was organised by the Martyn Bennett Trust, with musicians invited to workshops during the day, finishing with a concert in the evening. In 2008, Margaret Bennett released a CD single, Love and Loss, with three tracks where Bennett played to accompany his mother's singing; two of the tracks were previously unreleased. Mr McFall's Chamber, a string quartet from the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, toured with a tribute show Aye: An Affirmation of Martyn Bennett, performing pieces that were inspired by Bennett and his work. The tour began in Perth on 18 March and ended on 29 March in Findhorn. A further performance was part of the 2008 Edinburgh International Festival. In March 2012, an anthology was released on the Long Tale Recordings label, entitled Aye. The album consisted of remastered tracks and some new material, compiled by the Martyn Bennett Trust. In 2013, Creative Scotland announced they would fund an annual prize for new music composition, named in his honour. A stage show Grit: The Martyn Bennett Story was created by as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games cultural programme. After being conceived by Cora Bissett, it was written by Kieran Hurley. Bisset directed the show, having worked in close collaboration with his friends and family to create the show. It premiered at the Tramway in Glasgow in May 2014, then was performed in Mull. It was named event of the year at the 2014 Scots Trad Music Awards. Real World Records label re-released Grit, to coincide with the stage show. Greg Lawson, who had been friends with Bennett and who scored Liberation for a performance at Celtic Connections in 2006, went on to recreate Grit with an orchestral score for live performance. Lawson spent more than a year working on Nae Regrets, working out how an orchestra might recreate Bennett's precise arrangements. He assembled eighty musicians to form the Grit orchestra. On 15 January 2015, just over a decade after Bennet's death, Lawson conducted the Grit orchestra at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, to perform the Opening Concert at Celtic Connections. The concert was later named as the event of the year at the 2015 Trad awards. A further performance to take place on 23 August 2016 at the Edinburgh Playhouse will be part of the 2016 Edinburgh International Festival. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Bothy Culture, and the 25th anniversary of the Celtic Connections festival, Lawson and the orchestra, now containing some 100 traditional folk, classical and jazz musicians, performed the show Bothy Culture and Beyond at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow on 27 January 2018.

It is located in the Manningham district of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England and was built by Samuel Cunliffe Lister to replace the original Manningham Mills that were destroyed by fire in 1871. The mill is a Grade II* listed building, built in the Italianate style of Victorian architecture. At its height, Lister's employed 11,000 men, women and children ‚Äì manufacturing high-quality textiles such as velvet and silk. It supplied of velvet for King George V's coronation and in 1976 new velvet curtains for the President Ford White House. The 1890‚Äì91 strike at the mill was important in the establishment of the Independent Labour Party which later helped found the modern-day Labour Party. On completion in 1873, Lister's Mill was the largest textile mill in North England. Floor space in the mill amounts to 27 acres (109,000 m¬≤), and its imposing shape remains a dominant feature of the Bradford skyline. The chimney of the mill is high, and can be seen from most areas of Bradford. It cost about ¬£10,000 to build, and its total weight has been estimated at . Samuel Lister called it \\"Lister's Pride\\". Until the arrival of electric power in 1934, the mill was driven by huge steam boilers. Every week the boilers consumed 1,000 tons of coal brought in on company rail wagons from the company collieries near Pontefract. Water was also vital in the process and the company had its own supply network including a large covered reservoir on-site (now in 2006 that area is a piazza and underground car park). During the Second World War Lister's produced of real parachute silk, of flame-proof wool, of khaki battledress and of parachute cord.  Decline  The Lister's business decreased considerably during the 1980s. Stiff foreign competition and changing textile trends such as increased use of artificial fibres were the reasons. In 1999 the mills were closed. Being a prominent structure the mills attracted a great deal of attention and several regeneration proposals came and went. The sheer size of the buildings being a major difficulty. However local residents, former workers and notably Reverend George Moffat never lost hope that the mills would rise again. They campaigned hard to save the mills.  Rebirth  Lister Mills in 2010, from Lister Park In 2000 property developers Urban Splash bought the mills. They planned to renovate the existing larger buildings and build new ones. Apartments, workplaces, shops and public spaces were planned to be part of Listers. A deal was finally struck whereby remedial work on the structures and removal of industrial waste would be part-funded by Yorkshire Forward, Bradford Council and English Heritage. In September 2004 Freda Watts, a former silk weaver at Listers, cut a ribbon across the entrance to the mills ‚Äì construction work had started. The next landmark for the ¬£100 million project was the sales launch of the first phase. In late 2004 over 2,000 people queued (some overnight) to buy one of the 131 apartments being created in the south mill, now renamed Silk Warehouse. It was a sell out and a great boost for the project and the wider regeneration of Bradford New residents started moving in during 2006. The next phase, regenerating the second large building is to be called Velvet Mill. It is planned to replace the existing roof on this building with a glass and steel structure housing two storey apartments. David Morley practice are the architects. The new homes went on sale in early 2007. The plan is to create a new piazza with the huge mill chimney at its centre.

A primary concern of algorithmic topology, as its name suggests, is to develop efficient algorithms for solving problems that arise naturally in fields such as computational geometry, graphics, robotics, structural biology and chemistry, using methods from computable topology.Afra J. Zomorodian, Topology for Computing, Cambridge, 2005, xi Major algorithms by subject area =Algorithmic 3-manifold theory= A large family of algorithms concerning 3-manifolds revolve around normal surface theory, which is a phrase that encompasses several techniques to turn problems in 3-manifold theory into integer linear programming problems. * Rubinstein and Thompson's 3-sphere recognition algorithm. This is an algorithm that takes as input a triangulated 3-manifold and determines whether or not the manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. It has exponential run-time in the number of tetrahedral simplexes in the initial 3-manifold, and also an exponential memory profile. Moreover, it is implemented in the software package Regina.B.~Burton. Introducing Regina, the 3-manifold topology software, Experimental Mathematics 13 (2004), 267‚Äì272. Saul Schleimer went on to show the problem lies in the complexity class NP.http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgar/Maths/np.pdf Furthermore, Raphael Zentner showed that the problem lies in the complexity class coNP, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds. He uses instanton gauge theory, the geometrization theorem of 3-manifolds, and subsequent work of Greg Kuperberg on the complexity of knottedness detection. * The connect-sum decomposition of 3-manifolds is also implemented in Regina, has exponential run-time and is based on a similar algorithm to the 3-sphere recognition algorithm. * Determining that the Seifert-Weber 3-manifold contains no incompressible surface has been algorithmically implemented by Burton, Rubinstein and Tillmann and based on normal surface theory. * The Manning algorithm is an algorithm to find hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds whose fundamental group have a solution to the word problem.J.Manning, Algorithmic detection and description of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds with solvable word problem, Geometry and Topology 6 (2002) 1‚Äì26 At present the JSJ decomposition has not been implemented algorithmically in computer software. Neither has the compression-body decomposition. There are some very popular and successful heuristics, such as SnapPea which has much success computing approximate hyperbolic structures on triangulated 3-manifolds. It is known that the full classification of 3-manifolds can be done algorithmically.S.Matveev, Algorithmic topology and the classification of 3-manifolds, Springer-Verlag 2003  Conversion algorithms  * SnapPea implements an algorithm to convert a planar knot or link diagram into a cusped triangulation. This algorithm has a roughly linear run-time in the number of crossings in the diagram, and low memory profile. The algorithm is similar to the Wirthinger algorithm for constructing presentations of the fundamental group of link complements given by planar diagrams. Similarly, SnapPea can convert surgery presentations of 3-manifolds into triangulations of the presented 3-manifold. * D. Thurston and F. Costantino have a procedure to construct a triangulated 4-manifold from a triangulated 3-manifold. Similarly, it can be used to construct surgery presentations of triangulated 3-manifolds, although the procedure is not explicitly written as an algorithm in principle it should have polynomial run-time in the number of tetrahedra of the given 3-manifold triangulation. * S. Schleimer has an algorithm which produces a triangulated 3-manifold, given input a word (in Dehn twist generators) for the mapping class group of a surface. The 3-manifold is the one that uses the word as the attaching map for a Heegaard splitting of the 3-manifold. The algorithm is based on the concept of a layered triangulation. =Algorithmic knot theory= * Determining whether or not a knot is trivial is known to be in the complexity class NP . * The problem of determining the genus of a knot is known to have complexity class PSPACE. * There are polynomial-time algorithms for the computation of the Alexander polynomial of a knot. =Computational homotopy= * Computational methods for homotopy groups of spheres. * Computational methods for solving systems of polynomial equations. * Brown has an algorithm to compute the homotopy groups of spaces that are finite Postnikov complexes,E H Brown's \\"Finite Computability of Postnikov Complexes\\" annals of Mathematics (2) 65 (1957) pp 1‚Äì20 although it is not widely considered implementable. =Computational homology= Computation of homology groups of cell complexes reduces to bringing the boundary matrices into Smith normal form. Although this is a completely solved problem algorithmically, there are various technical obstacles to efficient computation for large complexes. There are two central obstacles. Firstly, the basic Smith form algorithm has cubic complexity in the size of the matrix involved since it uses row and column operations which makes it unsuitable for large cell complexes. Secondly, the intermediate matrices which result from the application of the Smith form algorithm get filled-in even if one starts and ends with sparse matrices. * Efficient and probabilistic Smith normal form algorithms, as found in the LinBox library. * Simple homotopic reductions for pre-processing homology computations, as in the Perseus software package. * Algorithms to compute persistent homology of filtered complexes, as in the TDAstats R package.

It was named after William Roxburgh. Range and habitat The native range extends from Tibet and Afghanistan through Pakistan, across northern India in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal and Bhutan, to Myanmar. It generally occurs at lower altitudes than other pines in the Himalaya, from , occasionally up to . The other Himalayan pines are Pinus wallichiana (blue pine), Pinus bhutanica (Bhutan white pine), Pinus armandii (Chinese white pine), Pinus gerardiana (chilgoza pine) and Pinus densata (Sikang pine), Pinus kesiya (Khasi Pine). Description Pinus roxburghii is a large tree reaching with a trunk diameter of up to , exceptionally . The bark is red-brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, thinner and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles of three, very slender, long, and distinctly yellowish green. The cones are ovoid conic, long and broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy chestnut-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next year or so, or after being heated by a forest fire, to release the seeds, opening to broad. The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed. Relationships Pinus roxburghii is closely related to Pinus canariensis (Canary Island pine), Pinus brutia (Turkish pine) and Pinus pinaster (maritime pine), which all share many features with it. It is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range. Ecology Pinus roxburghii forest in Uttarakhand, India Usually, the accumulating carpet of needles on the forest floor under these trees makes conditions unfavourable for many common plants and trees to grow. The most common trees which are able to grow in this environment are Rhododendron, banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) and trees from the family Ericaceae (known locally as eonr and lodar). This could possibly be due to the relative immunity from fire that the thick bark of these species gives them. The Himalayan stinging nettle is another plant which seems to thrive well under this tree. The caterpillars of the moth Batrachedra silvatica are not known from foodplants other than chir pine. The white-bellied heron, a large heron is known to roost in chir pine. Uses Chir pine is widely planted for timber in its native area, being one of the most important trees in forestry in northern Pakistan, India and Nepal. For local building purposes, the wood of this tree is the least preferred, as it is the weakest and most prone to decay when compared with other conifers. However, in most low altitude regions, there is no other choice, except for the fact that these being tropical latitudes there are other trees at lower altitudes. When this species of pine tree reaches a large girth, the bark forms flat patches which can be broken off in chunks . It has a layered structure like plywood, but the individual layers have no grain. The locals use this easily carvable bark to make useful items like lids for vessels. Blacksmiths of that region also use this bark exclusively as the fuel for their furnaces. Old trees which die from fire or drought, undergo some metamorphosis in their wood due to the crystallization of the resin inside the heart wood. This makes the wood become brightly coloured (various shades from translucent yellow to dark red) and very aromatic with a brittle, glassy feel. This form of wood known as jhukti by the locals is very easy to ignite. (It never gets wet or waterlogged.) They use it for starting fires and even for lighting, as a small piece of this burns for a long time (owing to the high resin content). Of all the conifer species in the area, only this one seems to be ideal for that purpose. Every autumn, the dried needles of this tree forms a dense carpet on the forest floor, which the locals gather in large bundles to serve as bedding for their cattle, for the year round. The green needles are also used to make tiny hand brooms. The locals of the Jaunsar-Bawar region of Uttarakhand have several uses for this tree which is known in the local dialect as salli. It is also occasionally used as an ornamental tree, planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas, where its heat and drought tolerance is valued.  Chemistry  Pinus roxburghii contains large amounts of taxifolin. = Resin = It is also tapped commercially for resin. On distillation, the resin yields an essential oil, commonly known as turpentine, and non-volatile rosin. The proportion of rosin and turpentine oil in chir pine is 75% and 22% respectively with 3% losses, etc. The turpentine is chiefly used as a solvent in pharmaceutical preparations, perfume industry, in manufacture of synthetic pine oil, disinfectants, insecticides and denaturants. It is one of the most important basic raw materials for the synthesis of terpene chemicals which are used in a wide variety of industries such as adhesives, paper and rubber, etc. Chir pine rosin is principally used in paper, soap, cosmetics, paint, varnish, rubber and polish industries. Besides these, other uses include manufacture of linoleum, explosives, insecticides and disinfectants, as a flux in soldering, in brewing and in mineral beneficiation as a frothing agent. Presently, India imports resin which is far superior in quality as well as cheaper than the indigenous one. Quality of resin depends on the pinene content. Imported resin contains 75‚Äì95% pinenes, whereas chir pine resin contains only about 25% pinenes.

This is generally agreed upon by historians. The villages of Nazareth and Capernaum in Galilee, where Jesus spent most of his time, were Aramaic-speaking communities. It is also likely that Jesus knew enough Koine Greek to converse with those not native to Judea, and it is reasonable to assume that Jesus was well versed in Hebrew for religious purposes. Cultural and linguistic background Aramaic was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean during and after the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenid empires (722‚Äì330 BC) and remained a common language of the region in the first century AD. In spite of the increasing importance of Greek, the use of Aramaic was also expanding, and it would eventually be dominant among Jews both in the Holy Land and elsewhere in the Middle East around 200 AD and would remain so until the Islamic conquests in the seventh century.Frederick E.

According to Dead Sea Scrolls archaeologist Yigael Yadin, Aramaic was the language of Hebrews until Simon Bar Kokhba's revolt (132 AD to 135 AD). Yadin noticed the shift from Aramaic to Hebrew in the documents he studied, which had been written during the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt. In his book, Bar Kokhba: The rediscovery of the legendary hero of the last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome, Yigael Yadin notes, \\"It is interesting that the earlier documents are written in Aramaic while the later ones are in Hebrew. Possibly the change was made by a special decree of Bar Kokhba who wanted to restore Hebrew as the official language of the state\\". In another book by Sigalit Ben- Zion, Yadin said: \\"it seems that this change came as a result of the order that was given by Bar Kokhba, who wanted to revive the Hebrew language and make it the official language of the state.\\" Yadin points out that Aramaic was the lingua franca at the time.Book \\"Bar Kokhba: The rediscovery of the legendary hero of the last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome\\" p. 234 Hebrew historian Josephus comments on learning Greek in first century Judea:The Antiquities of the Jews, by Flavius Josephus.

Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\\" Galatians 4:6 :Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \\"Abba, Father.\\" Romans 8:15 :The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, \\"Abba, Father.\\" Abba, an originally Aramaic form borrowed into the Greek Old Testament as a name (2Chr 29:1) [standing for the Hebrew Abijah ()], common in Mishnaic Hebrew and still used in Modern HebrewGreenspahn, Frederick E. 2003. An introduction to Aramaic. P.25 (written ŒëŒ≤Œ≤Œ¨[œÇ] in Greek, and ‚ÄôabbƒÅ in Aramaic), is immediately followed by the Greek equivalent (Œ†Œ±œÑŒÆœÅ) with no explicit mention of it being a translation. In Aramaic, it would be ◊ê◊ë◊ê. Note, the name Barabbas is a Hellenization of the Aramaic Bar Abba (◊ë◊® ◊ê◊ë◊ê), literally \\"Son of the Father\\". =Raca (Œ°Œ±Œ∫Œ¨)= Matthew 5:22 :But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother [without a cause] shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. (The bracketed text does not appear in all recensions and is absent in the Latin Vulgate.) Raca, or Raka, in the Aramaic and Hebrew of the Talmud, means empty one, fool, empty head. In Aramaic, it could be ◊®◊ô◊ß◊ê or ◊®◊ô◊ß◊î. =Mammon (ŒúŒ±ŒºœâŒΩŒ¨œÇ)= Gospel of Matthew 6:24 :No one can serve two masters: for either they will hate the one, and love the other; or else they will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Luke 16:9‚Äì13 :And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 2 Clement 6 :Now the Lord declares, \\"No servant can serve two masters.\\" If we desire, then, to serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for us. \\"For what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\" This world and the next are two enemies. The one urges to adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit; the other bids farewell to these things. We cannot, therefore, be the friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to make sure of the other. Let us reckon that it is better to hate the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those [who are to come,] as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments. (Roberts- Donaldson) In Aramaic, it could be ◊û◊û◊ï◊ü (or, in the typical Aramaic \\"emphatic\\" state suggested by the Greek ending, ◊û◊û◊ï◊†◊ê). This is usually considered to be an originally Aramaic word borrowed into Rabbinic Hebrew,Fern√°ndez, Miguel P√©rez and John Elwolde. 1999. An Introductory Grammar of Rabbinic Hebrew. P.5 but its occurrence in late Biblical Hebrew and, reportedly, in 4th century Punic may indicate that it had a more general \\"common Semitic background\\".Fitzmyer, Joseph A. 1979. A Wandering Aramean: Collected Aramaic Essays. P.12 In the New Testament, the word Mam≈çn√¢s is declined like a Greek word, whereas many of the other Aramaic and Hebrew words are treated as indeclinable foreign words. =Rabbuni (Œ°Œ±Œ≤Œ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒØ)= :Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. (KJV) Also in Mark 10:51. Hebrew form rabbi used as title of Jesus in Matthew 26:25,49; Mark 9:5, 11:21, 14:45; John 1:38, 1:49, 4:31, 6:25, 9:2, 11:8. In Aramaic, it would have been ◊®◊ë◊ï◊†◊ô. =Maranatha (ŒúŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏Œ¨)= Didache 10:6 (Prayer after Communion) :Let grace come, and let this world pass away. Hosanna to the God (Son) of David! If any one is holy, let him come; if any one is not so, let him repent. Maran-Atha. Amen. (Roberts-Donaldson) 1 Corinthians 16:22 :If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. Depending on how one selects to split the single Greek expression of the early manuscripts into Aramaic, it could be either ◊û◊®◊†◊ê ◊™◊ê (marana tha, \\"Lord, come!\\") or ◊û◊®◊ü ◊ê◊™◊ê (maran atha, \\"Our Lord has come\\"). =Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (·º®ŒªŒØ, ·º®ŒªŒØ, ŒªŒπŒº·Ω∞ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ±œáŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒØ)= Matthew 27:46 : Around the ninth hour, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, saying \\"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\\" which is, \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" Mark 15:34 : And at the ninth hour, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, \\"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\\" which is translated, \\"My God, my God, for what have you forsaken me?\\" This phrase, among the Sayings of Jesus on the cross, is given in these two versions. The Matthean version of the phrase is transliterated in Greek as ·º®ŒªŒØ, ·º®ŒªŒØ, ŒªŒµŒº·Ω∞ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ±œáŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒØ. The Markan version is ·ºòŒªœâŒê, ·ºòŒªœâŒê, ŒªŒ±Œº·Ω∞ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ±œáŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒØ (el≈çi rather than ƒìli and lama rather than lema). Overall, both versions appear to be Aramaic rather than Hebrew because of the verb (≈°bq) \\"abandon\\", which is originally Aramaic.Davies, William D. and Dale C. Allison. 1997. Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew. Volume III. P.624 The \\"pure\\" Biblical Hebrew counterpart to this word, (‚Äòzb) is seen in the second line of Psalm 22, which the saying appears to quote. Thus, Jesus is not quoting the canonical Hebrew version (ƒìlƒ´ ƒìlƒ´ lƒÅmƒÅ ‚ÄòazabtƒÅnƒ´) attributed in some Jewish interpretations to King David cited as Jesus' ancestor in Matthew's Genealogy of Jesus if the Eli, Eli version of Jesus' outcry is taken; he may be quoting the version given in an Aramaic Targum (surviving Aramaic Targums do use ≈°bq in their translations of the Psalm 22 The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon * Targum Psalms 22 Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion). The Markan word for \\"my god\\", ·ºòŒªœâŒê, definitely corresponds to the Aramaic form ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô, elƒÅhƒ´. The Matthean one, ·º®ŒªŒØ, fits in better with the ◊ê◊ú◊ô of the original Hebrew Psalm, as has been pointed out in the literature; however, it may also be Aramaic because this form is attested abundantly in Aramaic as well.Williams P.J. 2004. The linguistic background to Jesus' Dereliction Cry. The New Testament in its first century setting (ed. Williams P.J., Andre D. Clarke et al.) p. 7-8. In the next verse, in both accounts, some who hear Jesus' cry imagine that he is calling for help from Elijah (ƒílƒ´yƒÅ in Aramaic). Almost all ancient Greek manuscripts show signs of trying to normalize this text. For instance, the peculiar Codex Bezae renders both versions with Œ∑ŒªŒπ Œ∑ŒªŒπ ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ± Œ∂Œ±œÜŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒπ (ƒìli ƒìli lama zaphthani). The Alexandrian, Western and Caesarean textual families all reflect harmonization of the texts between Matthew and Mark. Only the Byzantine textual tradition preserves a distinction. The Aramaic word form ≈°…ô·∏áaqtanƒ´ is based on the verb ≈°…ô·∏áaq/≈°ƒÅ·∏áaq, 'to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake', with the perfect tense ending -t (2nd person singular: 'you'), and the object suffix -anƒ´ (1st person singular: 'me'). In Hebrew, the saying would be \\"\\", the Aramaic phrase would be \\"\\" or \\"\\". =Jot and tittle ()= Matthew 5:18 :For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the Law (that is, the Torah) till all is fulfilled. The quotation uses them as an example of extremely minor details. In the Greek text translated as English jot and tittle is found iota and keraia. Iota is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet (Œπ), but since only capitals were used at the time the Greek New Testament was written (Œô) and because the Torah was written in Hebrew, it probably represents the Hebrew yodh (◊ô) which is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Keraia is a hook or serif. =Korban (ŒöŒøœÅŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩ)= Matthew 27:6 :But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, ‚ÄòIt is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.‚Äô In Aramaic (◊ß◊®◊ë◊†◊ê) it refers to the treasury in the Temple in Jerusalem, derived from the Hebrew Korban (◊ß◊®◊ë◊ü), found in Mark 7:11 and the Septuagint (in Greek transliteration), meaning religious gift or offering. The Greek is declined as a Greek noun, much like other examples. =Sikera (Œ£ŒØŒ∫ŒµœÅŒ±)= Luke 1:15 :for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink; even before his birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit. =Hosanna ()= Mark 11:9 :Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! This word is derived from ◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ ◊†◊ê. It is generally considered to be a quote from Psalms 118:25 \\"O , save (us)\\", but the original Biblical Hebrew form was ◊î◊ï◊©◊ô◊¢◊î ◊†◊ê. The shortened form ◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ could be either Aramaic or Hebrew.Brunson, Andrew. 2003. Psalm 118 in the Gospel of John: An Intertextual Study on the New Exodus Pattern in the Theology of John. P.204Balz, Horst. Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 3. P.509 Aramaic personal names in the New Testament Personal names in the New Testament come from a number of languages; Hebrew and Greek are most common. However, there are a few Aramaic names as well. The most prominent feature in Aramaic names is bar (Greek transliteration Œ≤Œ±œÅ, Aramaic bar), meaning 'son of', a common patronym prefix. Its Hebrew equivalent, ben, is conspicuous by its absence. Some examples are: * ‚Äì Bartholomew (ŒíŒ±œÅŒ∏ŒøŒªŒøŒºŒ±·øñŒøœÇ from bar- T≈çlmay, perhaps \\"son of furrows\\" or \\"ploughman\\"). * ‚Äì Simon bar-Jona (Œ£ŒØŒºœâŒΩ ŒíŒ±œÅŒπœâŒΩ·æ∂œÇ from ≈†im‚Äò≈çn bar-Y≈çnƒÅ, \\"Simon son of Jonah\\"). * ‚Äì Simon bar-Jochanan (\\"Simon son of John\\"). * ‚Äì Barabbas (ŒíŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·æ∂œÇ from bar-AbbƒÅ, \\"son of the father\\"). * ‚Äì Bartimaeus (ŒíŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒºŒ±·øñŒøœÇ possibly from combination of Aramaic bar and Greek timaios meaning \\"honorable\\" or \\"highly prized\\", perhaps \\"honorable son\\"). * ‚Äì Barsabbas (ŒíŒ±œÅœÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·æ∂œÇ from bar-≈†abbƒÅ, \\"son of the Sabbath\\"). * ‚Äì Joseph who is called Barnabas (ŒíŒ±œÅŒΩŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÇ from bar-NavƒÅ meaning \\"son of prophecy\\", \\"the prophet\\", but given the Greek translation œÖ·º±·Ω∏œÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ; usually translated as \\"son of consolation/encouragement\\", the Greek could mean \\"invocation\\" as well). * ‚Äì Bar-Jesus (ŒíŒ±œÅŒπŒ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ from bar-I≈°o, \\"son of Jesus/Joshua\\"). =Boanerges (ŒíŒøŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œ≠œÇ)= Mark 3:17 : And James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, and he gave them the name Boanerges, which is Sons of Thunder. Jesus surnames the brothers James and John to reflect their impetuosity. The Greek rendition of their name is ŒíŒøŒ±ŒΩŒ∑œÅŒ≥Œ≠œÇ (Boanƒìrges). There has been much speculation about this name. Given the Greek translation that comes with it ('Sons of Thunder'), it seems that the first element of the name is bnƒì, 'sons of' (the plural of 'bar'), Aramaic (◊ë◊†◊ô). This is represented by Œ≤ŒøŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑ (boanƒì), giving two vowels in the first syllable where one would be sufficient. It could be inferred from this that the Greek transliteration may not be a good one. The second part of the name is often reckoned to be r·∏°a≈° ('tumult') Aramaic (◊®◊í◊ô◊©), or r·∏°az ('anger') Aramaic (◊®◊í◊ñ). Maurice Casey, however, argues that it is a simple misreading of the word for thunder, r‚Äòam (due to the similarity of s to the final m). This is supported by one Syriac translation of the name as bnay ra‚Äòm√¢. The Peshitta reads ‹í‹¢‹ù ‹™‹ì‹´‹ù bnay r·∏°e≈°y, which would fit with a later composition for it, based on a Byzantine reading of the original Greek. =Cephas (ŒöŒ∑œÜ·æ∂œÇ)= John 1:42 : He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \\"You are Simon son of John, you shall be called Cephas\\", which is translated 'Peter'. (New International Version) 1 Corinthians 1:12 : But I say that each of you says \\"I am of Paul\\", or \\"I am of Apollos\\", or \\"I am of Cephas\\", or \\"I am of Christ\\". Galatians 1:18 NRSV :Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him for fifteen days; In these passages, 'Cephas' is given as the nickname of the apostle better known as Simon Peter. The Greek word is transliterated (Kƒìph√¢s). The apostle's given name appears to be Simon, and he is given the Aramaic nickname, kƒìpƒÅ, meaning 'rock' or 'stone'. The final sigma (œÇ) is added in Greek to make the name masculine rather than feminine. That the meaning of the name was more important than the name itself is evidenced by the universal acceptance of the Greek translation, (Petros). It is not known why Paul uses the Aramaic name rather than the Greek name for Simon Peter when he writes to the churches in Galatia and Corinth.Bauer's Lexicon: Gal 1:18; 2:9,11,14; 1Cor 1:12; 3:22; 9:5; 15:5; also 1Clement 47:3 He may have been writing at a time before Cephas came to be popularly known as Peter. According to Clement of Alexandria, there were two people named Cephas: one was Apostle Simon Peter, and the other was one of Jesus' Seventy Apostles. Clement goes further to say it was Cephas of the Seventy who was condemned by Paul in Galatians 2 for not eating with the Gentiles, though this is perhaps Clement's way of deflecting the condemnation from Simon Peter. In any case the relationship of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism (which this involves) is still disputed. In Aramaic, it could be ◊õ◊ô◊§◊ê. =Thomas (ŒòœâŒº·æ∂œÇ)= John 11:16 : Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his co-disciples, \\"Now let us go that we might die with him!\\" Thomas () is listed among the disciples of Jesus in all four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. However, it is only in John's Gospel that more information is given. In three places (John 11:16, 20:24 and 21:2), he is given the name Didymus (), the Greek word for a twin. In fact, \\"the Twin\\" is not just a surname, it is a translation of \\"Thomas\\". The Greek ‚ÄîTh≈çm√¢s‚Äîcomes from the Aramaic t≈çmƒÅ, \\"twin\\". Therefore, rather than two personal names, Thomas Didymus, there is a single nickname, the Twin. Christian tradition gives him the personal name Judas, and he was perhaps named Thomas to distinguish him from others of the same name. In Aramaic, it could be ‹¨‹ê‹ò‹°‹ê. =Tabitha (Œ§Œ±Œ≤ŒπŒ∏Œ¨)= Acts 9:36 : In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. The disciple's name is given both in Aramaic (Œ§Œ±Œ≤ŒπŒ∏Œ¨) and Greek (ŒîŒøœÅŒ∫Œ¨œÇ). The Aramaic name is a transliteration of ·π¨·∏áƒ´thƒÅ, the female form of (·π¨a·∏áyƒÅ).The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon ‚Äì Entry for \\"·π≠by æ\\" Both names mean 'gazelle'. It may be just coincidence that Peter's words to her in verse 40, \\"Tabitha, get up!\\" (), are similar to the \\"talitha kum\\" phrase used by Jesus. In Aramaic, it could be ◊ò◊ë◊ô◊™◊ê. Aramaic place names in the New Testament =Gethsemane (ŒìŒµŒ∏œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒΩ·øÜ)= Matthew 26:36 : Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. Mark 14:32 : And they went to a place that has the name Gethsemane. The place where Jesus takes his disciples to pray before his arrest is given the Greek transliteration ŒìŒµŒ∏œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒΩ·øÜ (Gethsƒìmanƒì). It represents the Aramaic Gath-≈†mƒÅnƒì, meaning 'the oil press' or 'oil vat' (referring to olive oil). In Aramaic, it could be ‹ì‹ï‹£‹°‹¢. This place name is more properly an Aramaized version of an original Hebrew place name. Gath ◊í◊™ is a normal word for press in Hebrew, generally used for a wine press not an olive press though; and shemanei ◊©◊û◊†◊ô is the Hebrew word shemanim ◊©◊û◊†◊ô◊ù meaning \\"oils\\", the plural form of the word shemen ◊©◊û◊ü, the primary Hebrew word for oil, just in an Aramaic plural form (-ei instead of the Hebrew plural suffix -im). The word in Aramaic for \\"oil\\" is more properly mi≈°·∏•a (◊û◊©◊ó◊ê), as also attested in Jewish writings in Aramaic from the Galilee (see Caspar Levias, A Grammar of Galilean Aramaic, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1986). =Golgotha (ŒìŒøŒªŒ≥ŒøŒ∏·æ∂)= Mark 15:22 : And they took him up to the place Golgotha, which is translated Place of the Skull. John 19:17 : And carrying his cross by himself, he went out to the so-called Place of the Skull, which is called in 'Hebrew' Golgotha. Gag≈´ltƒÅ Aramaic, means 'skull'. The name appears in all of the gospels except Luke, which calls the place simply Kranion (ŒöœÅŒ±ŒΩŒØŒøŒΩ) 'the Skull' in Greek, with no Semitic counterpart. The name 'Calvary' is taken from the Latin Vulgate translation, Calvaria. In Aramaic, it could be ‹ì‹ì‹ò‹†‹¨‹ê. Though this word has the Aramaic final form -ta / -tha, it is otherwise also closer to the Hebrew word for skull, gulgolet ◊í◊ï◊ú◊í◊ï◊ú◊™, than to the Aramaic form. =Gabbatha (ŒìŒ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±Œ∏·æ∂)= John 19:13 : When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge's bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew, Gabbatha. The place name appears to be Aramaic. According to Josephus, War, V.ii.1, #51, the word Gabath means high place, or elevated place, so perhaps a raised flat area near the temple. The final \\"◊ê\\" could then represent the emphatic state of the noun. In Aramaic, it could be ◊í◊ë◊î◊™◊ê. =Akeldama (·ºàŒ∫ŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨) = Acts 1:19 : And this became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that field was called, in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is Field of Blood. The place of Judas Iscariot's death is clearly named Field of Blood in Greek. However, the manuscript tradition gives a number of different spellings of the Aramaic. The Majority Text reads ·ºàŒ∫ŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨ (Akeldama); other manuscript versions give ·ºàœáŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨œá (Acheldamach), ·ºâŒ∫ŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨ (Hakeldama), ·ºâœáŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨ (Hacheldama) and ·ºâŒ∫ŒµŒªŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒ¨œá (Hakeldamach). Despite these variant spellings the Aramaic is most probably ·∏•qƒìl dmƒÅ, 'field of blood'. While the seemingly gratuitous Greek sound of kh at the end of the word is difficult to explain, the Septuagint similarly adds this sound to the end of the Semitic name Ben Sira to form the Greek name for the Book of Sirakh (). The sound may be a dialectic feature of either the Greek speakers or the original Semitic language speakers. In Aramaic, it could be ◊ó◊ß◊ú ◊ì◊û◊ê. =Pool of Bethesda (ŒíŒ∑Œ∏ŒµœÉŒ¥Œ¨)= John 5:2 : Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. Bethesda was originally the name of a pool in Jerusalem, on the path of the Beth Zeta Valley, and is also known as the Sheep Pool. Its name in Aramaic means \\"House of Grace\\". It is associated with healing. In John 5, Jesus was reported healing a man at the pool. For other Aramaic place names in the New Testament beginning with beth (\\"house of\\"), see Bethabara, Bethany, Bethphage and Bethsaida and Bethlehem. In Aramaic, \\"Bethesda\\" could be spelled ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ó◊°◊ì◊ê.

Like the German nuclear weapons program, it suffered from an array of problems, and was ultimately unable to progress beyond the laboratory stage before the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Today, Japan's nuclear energy infrastructure makes it capable of constructing nuclear weapons at will. The de-militarization of Japan and the protection of the United States' nuclear umbrella have led to a strong policy of non-weaponization of nuclear technology, but in the face of nuclear weapons testing by North Korea, some politicians and former military officials in Japan are calling for a reversal of this policy. Background The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research building in Taisho period In 1934, Tohoku University professor Hikosaka Tadayoshi's \\"atomic physics theory\\" was released. Hikosaka pointed out the huge energy contained by nuclei and the possibility that both nuclear power generation and weapons could be created. In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting that they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons;O. Hahn and F. Strassmann. √úber den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle (\\"On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons\\"), Naturwissenschaften Volume 27, Number 1, 11‚Äì15 (1939). The authors were identified as being at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938. simultaneously, they communicated these results to Lise Meitner. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission The paper is dated 16 January 1939. Meitner is identified as being at the Physical Institute, Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, and Frisch as being at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen. and Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. The paper is dated 17 January 1939, and the experiment was conducted on 13 January 1939‚Äîsee Richard Rhodes The Making of the Atomic Bomb pp. 263, 268 Physicists around the world immediately realized that chain reactions could be produced and notified their governments of the possibility of developing nuclear weapons. World War II RIKEN Institute Masatoshi Okochi submitted a report on \\"Possibility of Uranium Bomb Manufacturing\\" in May 1941. The leading figure in the Japanese atomic program was Dr. Yoshio Nishina, a close associate of Niels Bohr and a contemporary of Albert Einstein. Nishina had co-authored the Klein‚ÄìNishina formula. Nishina had established his own Nuclear Research Laboratory to study high-energy physics in 1931 at RIKEN Institute (the Institute for Physical and Chemical Research), which had been established in 1917 in Tokyo to promote basic research. Nishina had built his first cyclotron in 1936, and another , 220-ton cyclotron in 1937. In 1938 Japan also purchased a cyclotron from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Yoshio Nishina completed this \\"small\\" cyclotron in 1937, the first cyclotron constructed outside the United States (and the second in the world). In 1939 Nishina recognized the military potential of nuclear fission, and was worried that the Americans were working on a nuclear weapon which might be used against Japan. Indeed, in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt started the first investigations into fission weapons in the United States, which eventually evolved into the massive Manhattan Project, and the laboratory from which Japan purchased a cyclotron became one of the major sites for weapons research. The second RIKEN cyclotron, completed in 1943 In the early summer of 1940 Nishina met Lieutenant-General Takeo Yasuda on a train. Yasuda was at the time director of the Army Aeronautical Department's Technical Research Institute. Nishina told Yasuda about the possibility of building nuclear weapons. However, the Japanese fission project did not formally begin until April 1941 when Yasuda acted on Army Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç's order to investigate the possibilities of nuclear weapons. Yasuda passed the order down the chain of command to Viscount Masatoshi ≈åk≈çchi, director of the RIKEN Institute, who in turn passed it to Nishina, whose Nuclear Research Laboratory by 1941 had over 100 researchers. Meanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Technology Research Institute had been pursuing its own separate investigations, and had engaged professors from the Imperial University, Tokyo, for advice on nuclear weapons. This resulted in the formation of the Committee on Research in the Application of Nuclear Physics, chaired by Nishina, that met ten times between July 1942 and March 1943. It concluded in a report that while an atomic bomb was, in principle, feasible, \\"it would probably be difficult even for the United States to realize the application of atomic power during the war\\". This caused the Navy to lose interest and to concentrate instead on research into radar. =Ni-Go Project= The Army was not discouraged, and soon after the Committee issued its report it set up an experimental project at RIKEN, the Ni-Go Project. Its aim was to separate uranium-235 by thermal diffusion, ignoring alternative methods such as electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and centrifugal separation. By February 1945, a small group of scientists had succeeded in producing a small amount of material in a rudimentary separator in the RIKEN complex‚Äîmaterial which RIKEN's cyclotron indicated was not uranium-235. The separator project came to an end two months later when the building housing it was destroyed in March 1945 in a fire caused by the USAAF's Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo. No attempt was made to build a uranium pile; heavy water was unavailable, but Takeuchi Masa, who was in charge of Nishina's separator, calculated that light water would suffice if the uranium could be enriched to 5‚Äì10% uranium-235. While these experiments were in progress, the Army and Navy carried out searches for uranium ore, in locations ranging from Fukushima Prefecture to Korea, China, and Burma. The Japanese also requested materials from their German allies and of unprocessed uranium oxide was dispatched to Japan in April 1945 aboard the submarine , which however surrendered to US forces in the Atlantic following Germany's surrender. The uranium oxide was reportedly labeled as \\"U-235\\", which may have been a mislabeling of the submarine's name and its exact characteristics remain unknown; some sources believe that it was not weapons-grade material and was intended for use as a catalyst in the production of synthetic methanol to be used for aviation fuel. According to Williams, \\"The same lack of sufficient high quality uranium that had impeded the German atomic project had also, as it turned out, obstructed Japanese attempts to make a bomb.\\" This was the conclusion of the Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, who also reported Japan's nuclear physicists were just as good as those from other nations. =F-Go Project= In 1943 a different Japanese Naval command began a nuclear research program, the F-Go Project, under Bunsaku Arakatsu at the Imperial University, Kyoto. Arakatsu had spent some years studying abroad including at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford and at Berlin University under Albert Einstein. Next to Nishina, Arakatsu was the most notable nuclear physicist in Japan. His team included Hideki Yukawa, who would become in 1949 the first Japanese physicist to receive a Nobel Prize. Early on in the war Commander Kitagawa, head of the Navy Research Institute's Chemical Section, had requested Arakatsu to carry out work on the separation of Uranium-235. The work went slowly, but shortly before the end of the war he had designed an ultracentrifuge (to spin at 60,000 rpm) which he was hopeful would achieve the required results. Only the design of the machinery was completed before the Japanese surrender. Bunsaku Arakatsu's accelerator demolishing by GHQ, 24 November 1945. Shortly after the surrender of Japan, the Manhattan Project's Atomic Bomb Mission, which had deployed to Japan in September, reported that the F-Go Project had obtained 20 grams a month of heavy water from electrolytic ammonia plants in Korea and Kyushu. In fact, the industrialist Jun Noguchi had launched a heavy water production program some years previously. In 1926 Noguchi founded the Korean Hydro Electric Company at Konan (now known as Hungnam) in north-eastern Korea: this became the site of an industrial complex producing ammonia for fertilizer production. However, despite the availability of a heavy-water production facility whose output could potentially have rivalled that of Norsk Hydro at Vemork in Norway, it appears that the Japanese did not carry out neutron-multiplication studies using heavy water as a moderator at Kyoto. =Postwar aftermath= On 16 October 1945 Nishina sought permission from the American occupation forces to use the two cyclotrons at the Riken Institute for biological and medical research, which was soon granted; however, on 10 November instructions were received from the US Secretary of War in Washington to destroy the cyclotrons at the Riken, Kyoto University, and Osaka University. This was done on 24 November; the Riken's cyclotrons were taken apart and thrown into Tokyo Bay.Maas and Hogg, pp. 198-199 In a letter of protest against this destruction Nishina wrote that the cyclotrons at the Riken had had nothing to do with the production of nuclear weapons, however the large cyclotron had officially been a part of the Ni-Go Project. Nishina had placed it within the Project by suggesting that the cyclotron could serve basic research for the use of nuclear power, simply so that he could continue working on the device; the military nature of the Project gave him access to funding and kept his researchers from being drafted into the armed forces. He felt no qualms about this because he saw no possibility of producing nuclear weapons in Japan before the end of the war. =Reports of a Japanese weapon test= On October 2, 1946 the Atlanta Constitution published a story by reporter David Snell, who had been an investigator with the 24th Criminal Investigation Detachment in Korea after the war, which alleged that the Japanese had successfully tested a nuclear weapon near Hungnam (Konan) before the town was captured by the Soviets. He said that he had received his information at Seoul in September 1945 from a Japanese officer to whom he gave the pseudonym of Captain Wakabayashi, who had been in charge of counter-intelligence at Hungnam.Dees, pp. 20-21 SCAP officials, who were responsible for strict censorship of all information about Japan's wartime interest in nuclear physics,\\"The Allied Occupation and Japan's Economic Miracle: Building the Foundations of Japanese Science and Technology 1945-52\\" pub 1997, by Bowen Causey Dees, pages 96-97 were dismissive of Snell's report. Under the 1947-48 investigation, comments were sought from Japanese scientists who would or should have known about such a project. Further doubt is cast on Snell's story by the lack of evidence of large numbers of Japanese scientists leaving Japan for Korea and never returning. Snell's statements were repeated by Robert K. Wilcox in his 1985 book Japan's Secret War: Japan's Race Against Time to Build Its Own Atomic Bomb. The book also included what Wilcox stated was new evidence from intelligence material which indicated the Japanese might have had an atomic program at Hungnam. These specific reports were dismissed in a review of the book by Department of Energy employee Roger M. Anders which was published in the journal Military Affairs, an article written by two historians of science in the journal Isis and another article in the journal Intelligence and National Security. In 1946 talking about his wartime efforts Arakatsu said he was making \\"tremendous strides\\" towards making an atomic bomb and that the Soviet Union probably already had one.ABC reporter with Prof Arakatsu Bunsuku, The New York Times, 15 October 1946. Postwar Since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has been a staunch upholder of antinuclear sentiments. Its postwar Constitution forbids the establishment of offensive military forces, and in 1967 it adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, ruling out the production, possession, or introduction of nuclear weapons. Despite this, the idea that Japan might become a nuclear power has persisted. After China's first nuclear test in 1964, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sat≈ç said to President Lyndon Johnson when they met in January 1965, that if the Chinese Communists had nuclear weapons, the Japanese should also have them. This shocked Johnson's administration, especially when Sato added that \\"Japanese public opinion will not permit this at present, but I believe that the public, especially the younger generation, can be 'educated'.\\" Throughout Sato's administration Japan continued to discuss the nuclear option. It was suggested that tactical nuclear weapons, as opposed to larger strategic weapons, could be defined as defensive, and therefore be allowed by the Japanese Constitution. A White Paper commissioned by future Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone opined that it would be possible that possessing small- yield, purely defensive nuclear weapons would not violate the Constitution, but that in view of the danger of adverse foreign reaction and possible war, a policy would be followed of not acquiring nuclear weapons \\"at present\\". =Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty= The Johnson administration became anxious about Sato's intentions and made securing Japan's signature to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) one of its top priorities. In December 1967, to reassure the Japanese public, Sato announced the adoption of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. These were that Japan would not manufacture, possess, or permit nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. The principles, which were adopted by the Diet, but are not law, have remained the basis of Japan's nuclear policy ever since. According to Kei Wakaizumi, one of Sato's policy advisers, Sato realized soon after making the declaration that it might be too constraining. He therefore clarified the principles in a February 1968 address to the Diet by declaring the \\"Four Nuclear Policies\\" (\\"Four-Pillars Nuclear Policy\\"): * Promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy * Efforts towards global nuclear disarmament * Reliance and dependence on US extended deterrence, based on the 1960 US-Japan Security Treaty * Support for the \\"Three Non-Nuclear Principles under the circumstances where Japan's national security is guaranteed by the other three policies.\\" It followed that if American assurance was ever removed or seemed unreliable, Japan might have no choice but to go nuclear. In other words, it kept the nuclear option available. In 1969 a policy planning study for Japan's Foreign Ministry concluded that Japan should, even if it signed the NPT, maintain the economic and technical ability to develop and produce nuclear weapons in case it should ever become necessary, for example due to the international situation. Japan finally signed the NPT in 1970 and ratified it in 1976, but only after West Germany became a signatory and the US promised \\"not to interfere with Tokyo's pursuit of independent reprocessing capabilities in its civilian nuclear power program\\". =Extension of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty= In 1995 the Clinton administration pushed the Japanese government to endorse the indefinite extension of the NPT, but it opted for an ambiguous position on the issue. A former Japanese government official recalled, \\"We thought it was better for us not to declare that we will give up our nuclear option forever and ever\\". However, eventually pressure from Washington and other nations led to Japan's supporting the indefinite extension. In 1998 two events strengthened the hand of those in Japan advocating that the nation should at least reconsider if not reverse its non-nuclear policy. Advocates of such policies included conservative academics, some government officials, a few industrialists, and nationalist groups. The first of these events was India and Pakistan both conducting nuclear tests; the Japanese were troubled by a perceived reluctance on the part of the international community to condemn the two countries' actions, since one of the reasons Japan had opted to join the NPT was that it had anticipated severe penalties for those states who defied the international consensus against further nuclear proliferation. Also, Japan and other nations feared that an Indian nuclear arsenal could cause a localized nuclear arms race with China. The second event was the August 1998 launch of a North Korean Taepodong-1 missile over Japan which caused a public outcry and led some to call for remilitarization or the development of nuclear weapons. Fukushiro Nukaga, head of the Japan Defense Agency, said that his government would be justified in mounting pre-emptive strikes against North Korean missile bases. Prime Minister Keiz≈ç Obuchi reiterated Japan's non- nuclear weapon principles and said that Japan would not possess a nuclear arsenal, and that the matter was not even worthy of discussion. However, it is thought that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi implied he agreed that Japan had the right to possess nuclear weapons when he added, \\"it is significant that although we could have them, we don't\\". Earlier, Shinz≈ç Abe had said that Japan's constitution did not necessarily ban possession of nuclear weapons, so long as they were kept at a minimum and were tactical weapons, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda had expressed a similar view. =De facto nuclear state= While there are currently no known plans in Japan to produce nuclear weapons, it has been argued Japan has the technology, raw materials, and the capital to produce nuclear weapons within one year if necessary, and many analysts consider it a de facto nuclear state for this reason. For this reason Japan is often said to be a \\"screwdriver's turn\\" away from possessing nuclear weapons, or to possess a \\"bomb in the basement\\". Significant amounts of reactor-grade plutonium are created as a by-product of the nuclear energy industry. During the 1970s, the Japanese government made several appeals to the United States to use reprocessed plutonium in forming a \\"plutonium economy\\" for peaceful commercial use. This began a significant debate within the Carter administration about the risk of proliferation associated with reprocessing while also acknowledging Japan‚Äôs need for energy and right to the use of peaceful nuclear technology. Ultimately, an agreement was reached that allowed Japan to repurpose the byproducts of nuclear power-related activities; however their efforts regarding fast-breeding plutonium reactors were largely unsuccessful. Japan was reported in 2012 to have 9 tonnes of plutonium in Japan, enough for more than 1,000 nuclear warheads, and an additional 35 tonnes stored in Europe. It has constructed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, which could produce further plutonium. Japan has a considerable quantity of highly enriched uranium (HEU), supplied by the U.S. and UK, for use in its research reactors and fast neutron reactor research programs; approximately 1,200 to 1,400 kg of HEU as of 2014. Japan also possesses an indigenous uranium enrichment plant which could hypothetically be used to make highly enriched uranium suitable for weapons use. Japan has also developed the M-V three-stage solid-fuel rocket, somewhat similar in design to the U.S. LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM, giving it a missile technology base. It now has an easier- to-launch second generation solid-fuel rocket, Epsilon. Japan has experience in re-entry vehicle technology (OREX, HOPE-X). Toshiyuki Shikata, a Tokyo Metropolitan Government adviser and former lieutenant general, said that part of the rationale for the fifth M-V Hayabusa mission, from 2003 to 2010, was that the re-entry and landing of its return capsule demonstrated \\"that Japan's ballistic missile capability is credible.\\" In 2011, former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba explicitly backed the idea of Japan maintaining the capability of nuclear latency: On 24 March 2014, Japan agreed to turn over more than of weapons grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium to the US, which started to be returned in 2016. It has been pointed out that as long as Japan enjoys the benefits of a \\"nuclear-ready\\" status held through surrounding countries, it will see no reason to actually produce nuclear arms, since by remaining below the threshold, although with the capability to cross it at short notice, Japan can expect the support of the US while posing as an equal to China and Russia. On 29 March 2016, then-U.S. President candidate Donald Trump suggested that Japan should develop its own nuclear weapons, claiming that it was becoming too expensive for the US to continue to protect Japan from countries such as China, North Korea, and Russia that already have their own nuclear weapons.

It was developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation as a part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. It can also be used as an anti-sea skimmer from a ship against low flying attacking missiles. History and development The Trishul missile project was commissioned in 1983 as a part of Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. The project was to be completed by 1992 and the missile would be fitted to Brahmaputra-class frigates as an anti-sea skimmer. In 1985, Trishul made its first unguided flight from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The missile made its first full range guided flight in 1989. In 1992, the missile was successfully tested against a target and reached Mach 2 speed. In 1997, the associated radar systems for detecting the incoming sea-skimmer were operational. The launch system was developed by Bharat Dynamics Limited in 1998. In 1997, Indian Navy expressed its displeasure in the delay in the development of Trishul for the Brahmaputra-class frigates. The navy opted for the Israeli Barak 1 Anti missile defence system. By 1998, the missile had undergone over 24 flight trials and the missile was inducted into service by Indian Army and Indian Airforce in 1999. The missile was reviewed by the DRDO in October 2001. The missile system was found deficient as the tracking radar beam was getting intermittent breaks resulting in the missile missing the target and the heavy BMP-II chassis did not meet the army qualitative requirements for mobility. The naval version was test fired as a sea skimmer in 2002. In 2003, Government of India announced that the missile will be a technology demonstrator and de-linked it from other projects. The missile was successfully test fired in 2005. The development cost of the programme was and the Defence minister announced the official closure of the programme in 2008. The missile did not enter production or induction and substituted by Barak missiles.

Biography  Kazimierz Kutz was born on 16 February 1929 in Szopienice, since 1960 district of Katowice, to a railway worker and a former partisan of the Silesian Uprisings. After the World War II Kutz graduated from gymnasium in Mys≈Çowice and in 1949 was admitted to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Film School. After finishing his studies in 1954 he started working as an assistant to Andrzej Wajda. His film debut was Krzy≈º Walecznych (1959). Since then he finished more than 20 pictures, including six about his home region - Silesia. He is also famous for directing theatre plays on some of the most prominent scenes of Poland, including the Teatr Stary in Krak√≥w and National Theatre in Warsaw, as well as several plays for the Polish television. In 1972, he founded the Silesia Film Company in Katowice and, until 1978, was its Artistic Director. In the 1970s he became the main director of the Polish Television branch in Katowice. He was also working for several branch and cultural organisations. After the Martial Law had been imposed in Poland in 1981 Kutz was interned by the communist authorities, but was released soon afterwards. Between 1981 and 1983, lectured in the Radio and Television Faculty at Silesian University in Katowice, and, between 1985 and 1991, taught directing at the Higher Theatre School in Krak√≥w. Since 1987, was Principal Director in the Polish Television Centre in Katowice and, between 1990 and 1991, headed the Centre. After the peaceful transition to democracy in 1989 Kutz became the head of the Polish TV branch in Krak√≥w (until 1991). For his involvement in the matters of Silesia, and for his films depicting the traditions and problems of that part of Poland, he is considered by some the spokesman of all Silesians. In a plebiscite organised by Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper he was chosen the third most famous Silesian ever and the first among the living people. In 1997 he was awarded with the title of doctor honoris causa by the University of Opole. He is currently a promoter and patron of several Silesia-based cultural feasts and societies, including the Festiwal Film√≥w Kultowych, Festiwal Sztuki Re≈ºyserskiej, Cultural Congress of the Upper Silesia, Council of Culture of the Silesian Voivodship, Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice () and Committee for the Construction of Silesian Museum. He is also one of the supporters of development of the Silesian language. His 1995 film Reverted was entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1997 Kutz took part in the elections to the Senate of Poland (from the list of Freedom Union party, Katowice constituency) and was supported by approximately 500,000 Silesians. In 2001 he was elected for his second term as a non-partisan candidate, and in 2005 re-elected for the third term. Recently, he was the deputy speaker of the Senate of Poland. For his social involvements he was awarded with many of the highest Polish awards. Kazimierz Kutz was married to Iwona and had two sons (Gabriel and Tymek) and two daughters (Wiktoria and Kamila).

When he was 16, he burst into song after winning a game of cards, and the friend with whom he was playing said he must get his voice trained. Two years later he began studying in earnest with the baritones Luigi Montesanto and Mariano Stabile, the latter impressing on the young tenor the importance of clear diction, advice he readily followed. World War Two interrupted di Stefano's early career as he had to join the Italian army, where he often entertained the troops with his singing. He was considered such a bad soldier that his commanding officer decided that he would better serve his country by leaving the forces in order to sing. He performed under the pseudonym Nino Florio until Italy was defeated, when he fled to Switzerland. After a period of internment he was allowed to sing on Lausanne Radio, where he made the first of his recordings, disclosing a tenor voice of decided beauty and a singer with personality. He recorded many of his native Sicilian songs, records of which first brought him to the attention of discerning ears outside Italy in the late 1940s.  Career  Giuseppe Di Stefano and Ino Savini - 'La Boh√®me' (1962) He began his career as a lyric tenor, notable in roles such as Nemorino in Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore and Alfredo in Verdi's La Traviata. He made his New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera in February 1948 as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's RigolettoGiuseppe Di Stefano ‚Äì Metropolitan Opera debut, February 25, 1948, Metropolitan Opera after singing the role in Riccione with Hj√∂rdis Schymberg in August of the previous year. After his performance in Manon a month later, Musical America wrote that Di Stefano \\"had the rich velvety sound we have seldom heard since the days of Gigli\\".Musical America April 1948, p. 44. He went on to perform regularly in New York for many years. In 1957, Di Stefano made his British debut at the Edinburgh Festival as Nemorino in L'elisir d'amore and his Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, debut in 1961, as Cavaradossi in Tosca. As a singer, Di Stefano was admired for his excellent diction, unique timbre, passionate delivery and, in particular, for the sweetness of his soft singing. In his Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast debut in Faust, he attacked the high C forte and then softened to a pianissimo. Sir Rudolf Bing said in his memoirs, \\"The most spectacular single moment in my observation year had come when I heard his diminuendo on the high C in \\"\\" in Faust: I shall never as long as I live forget the beauty of that sound\\".Bing, Rudolf (1972) 5000 Nights at the Opera. Hamish Hamilton, p. 145. During his years of international celebrity, Di Stefano won a gold Orfeo, an Italian musical award. In 1953 Walter Legge, leader of EMI's classical wing, wanted a tenor to record all the popular Italian operas with Maria Callas, and chose Di Stefano. Among their recording achievements was the famous 1953 studio recording of Tosca under Victor de Sabata, which is considered \\"as being one of the great performances in the history of the gramophone\\".Rosenthal, Harold (1973) Opera Vol. 24 No. 5, p. 438. The two also performed together on stage frequently, from 1951 in South America to the end of 1957 in Un ballo in maschera at La Scala, the last time the two collaborated in an opera. He sang Alfredo in the famous Visconti production of La traviata in 1955 at La Scala, as well as Edgardo to her Lucia under Herbert von Karajan at La Scala, Berlin and Vienna. Rudolf Bing of the Metropolitan Opera House lamented Di Stefano's playboy lifestyle, which he felt was the cause of his vocal decline, although Di Stefano himself blamed allergies to synthetic fibres for permanently damaging his vocal cords. In 1973, Di Stefano and Maria Callas went together for a recital tour that ended in 1974: critics remarked that Maria Callas had lost her voice, but the public reaction was nevertheless enthusiastic everywhere. It was during this period that there were rumors of a brief romantic relationship between the two singers. Di Stefano continued to sing successfully and his final operatic role was as the Emperor in Turandot, in July 1992. = Private life and death = Giuseppe di Stefano later in life - 1983 In 1949 he married the conservatory student Maria Girolami in New York, with whom he had three children. The pair separated in 1976. In 1977 he began a new romantic relationship with Monika Curth, an operetta soprano originally from Hamburg, whom he married in 1993. His last public appearance was on 24 October 2004 in Oderzo to receive an award.Giuseppe Di Stefano - Tenore - YouTube On 3 December 2004, he was seriously injured during a robbery at his home in Diani Beach in Kenya by unknown assailants who left him on the ground bloodied and unconscious. After being admitted to a hospital in Mombasa, his condition proved to be more serious than it had appeared at first. After undergoing at least three operations, he went into a coma on 7 December. On 23 December, he was transferred to Italy, where he was hospitalised in Milan. Eventually he awoke from the coma, but his health never fully improved. He died in his home in Santa Maria Ho√®, north of Milan, on 3 March 2008 at the age of 86.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/03/classicalmusicandopera.comment  Vocal and singing style  Di Stefano had a soft voice, with an unmistakable warm and rich timbre and, at least in the early years, was very expansive. He was admired for his vocal skills, clear diction, passionate phrasing, captivating interpretation and the exquisite lightness of pianissimo and shades. Far from the studious precision and \\"aplomb\\" of a Bjorling or a Kraus, or the vocal overpowering of a Del Monaco or stylistic rigour of a Bergonzi, Di Stefano had a natural musicality, with a generous, instinctive and communicative style of singing. Di Stefano can be placed in the tradition of tenori lirici post-romantic of the Italian and French repertoire, where he gave memorable performances especially in the first part of his career (Rigoletto, La traviata, La boh√®me, The pearl fishermen, Manon, Faust). In the following years he developed into roles of the lyrical repertoire, with more drive and drama (Tosca, La forza del destino, Turandot, Carmen, up to Pagliacci and Andrea Ch√©nier). Recordings with Maria Callas Giuseppe di Stefano with Maria Callas on her farewell tour on 9 December 1973. Di Stefano and Maria Callas recorded many operas together, all of which for EMI. Together they recorded the following complete operas: *Lucia di Lammermoor ‚Äì 1953 *I puritani ‚Äì 1953 *Cavalleria rusticana ‚Äì 1953 *Tosca ‚Äì 1953 *Pagliacci ‚Äì 1954 *Rigoletto ‚Äì 1955 *Il trovatore ‚Äì 1956 *La boh√®me ‚Äì 1956 *Un ballo in maschera ‚Äì 1956 *Manon Lescaut ‚Äì 1957 A series of duets with Di Stefano and Callas was recorded by the Philips label in the period November‚ÄìDecember 1972, with Antonio de Almeida conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. These recordings were not published officially, but a 'pirate' version did appear. Other recordings Di Stefano also made many other recordings with other wonderful singers, complete EMI sets of Madama Butterfly (opposite Victoria de los √Ångeles, 1954) and La traviata (with Antonietta Stella and Tito Gobbi, 1955). For English Decca he recorded L'elisir d'amore with Hilde Gueden and Fernando Corena (1955), La Gioconda (with Zinka Milanov and Leonard Warren, 1957), La forza del destino (1958) and Tosca (with Leontyne Price and Giuseppe Taddei, Herbert von Karajan conducting, 1962). For Ricordi (Ricordi MRO 104/105), he made a complete stereo Lucia di Lammermoor with Renata Scotto, Ettore Bastianini and Ivo Vinco in 1958, with Nino Sanzogno conducting the Orchestra and Chorus of La Scala, Milan. In 1995, VAI issued an approved version of La boh√®me, from a 1959 performance in New Orleans, with the tenor starring opposite Licia Albanese, Audrey Schuh, Giuseppe Valdengo and Norman Treigle. Additionally, in 1962 the tenor recorded excerpts from Massenet's Manon, with Anna Moffo, conducted by Ren√© Leibowitz. In 1951, Di Stefano sang in a performance of Verdi's Requiem, at Carnegie Hall, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, the other soloists being Herva Nelli, Fedora Barbieri and Cesare Siepi. It was released as a recording by RCA.

Early life Clarke was born in Elora, Ontario, Canada, son of a prominent Ontario parliamentarian. Career He graduated from University of Toronto in 1879 and went on to found the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now the Canadian Mental Health Association) in 1914 with Dr. Clarence Hincks. As Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at University of Toronto, he oversaw creation of the Department of Psychiatry, and development of the medical school. Clarke first practised psychiatry at the 999 Queen Street institution in Toronto, Ontario. In 1880, then took a post at the Hamilton, Ontario asylum. Dr. Clarke was a student and brother-in-law of Dr. Joseph Workman, Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. Clarke was an early proponents of eugenics, emphasizing the importance of restrictive laws that would limit the immigration and marriage of the \\"mentally defective.\\" To them, such laws seemed necessary to stem the explosive growth of state and provincial mental asylums where foreign-born patients made up more than 50 percent of the hospital population. Further, the growth of hereditarian views in science supported eugenic proposals; psychiatry's desire for greater respectability in the medical profession made eugenic \\"science\\" attractive. By 1905, Clarke had abandoned the movement, and many of the other leading psychiatrists would follow suit by the end of World War I, when it was clear that eugenic measures were not having the desired effects. He joined his other brother-in-law, Dr. William Metcalfe at the Rockwood Hospital for the Insane, the psychiatric hospital in Kingston in 1881 and began a series of reforms in the care of the insane. One of these was freeing patients from confinement. On 13 August 1885, a paranoid patient attacked them both and killed Dr. Metcalfe. Dr. Clarke survived and succeeded his brother-in-law as Medical superintendent of facility. Dr. Clarke carried on in Kingston until 1905 when he succeeded Dr. Daniel Clark as superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. In 1911 he resigned from government service and was appointed superintendent of the Toronto General Hospital. Family Dr. Clarke was married to Margaret DeVeber (from 1880 until her death in 1902CLARKE, CHARLES KIRK Dictionary of Canadian Biography at biographi.ca) with whom he had four sons and two daughters. Three of his sons were active as ice hockey players on professional or amateur levels in Canada and the United States. Charles Marshall Clarke (1881‚Äì1940) played with the Kingston Frontenacs and the Queen's University team in Kingston, Ontario and with the New York Athletic Club and the New York Wanderers in the AAHL, Harold Metcalfe Clarke (1885‚Äì1924) played with the Kingston Frontenacs, the University of Toronto, and with the New York Athletic Club, and Herbert Secord Clarke (1887‚Äì1938) played with the Kingston Frontenacs, the University of Toronto, and with the Cobalt Silver Kings of the National Hockey Association. From 1904 until his death in 1924 Dr. Clarke was married to Theresa Gallagher. End of life Clarke became ill in the autumn of 1923 and died in Toronto early the next year. A headline in the Toronto Sunday World of 23 March 1924 read \\"Canada owes immeasurable debt to Dr. C.K. Clarke who helped to lift the shadow of misery and hopelessness from insane asylums\\". The Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto, Ontario, Canada was named in his honour. References *Dowbiggin, Ian Robert.

After a farewell tour they split, relocated to Los Angeles and formed Zeromancer in January 2000. Seigmen reunited during the UKA-festival in Trondheim on October 20, 2005, and decided in November 2005 to do even more reunion gigs in Norway: there were seven shows in February 2006. Having great success with the reunion tour, they did six more gigs at various festivals across Norway during summer 2006, mostly as the headlining act. Media reports that summer said that Seigmen did not rule out another reunion some time in the future. In early 2008 it was announced that Seigmen would again play live, which they did on June 21 the Oslo Opera House, as one of the shows celebrating the opening of the new Opera House in Oslo. Selling out the show quickly, a second concert was set up the day after. In 2013 they contributed to the book \\"Think like a rockstar\\" Tenk som en rockestjerne, by St√•le √òkland.

Symptoms can include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, learning difficulties and problems with hearing or sight. Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk activities and have problems with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by a mother drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Surveys from the United States found that about 10% of pregnant women drank alcohol in the past month, and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy. About 3.6% of pregnant American women are alcoholics. The risk of FASD depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as at what point in pregnancy the alcohol was consumed. Other risk factors include older age of the mother, smoking, and poor diet. There is no known safe amount or time to drink alcohol during pregnancy. While drinking small amounts does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues. Alcohol crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing fetus. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms in the person. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are preventable by avoiding alcohol. For this reason, medical authorities recommend no alcohol during pregnancy or while trying to become pregnant. While the condition is permanent, treatment can improve outcomes. Interventions may include parent‚Äìchild interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and possibly medications. FASD is estimated to affect between 1% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1,000 live births in the United States. In South Africa, some populations have rates as high as 9%. The negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy have been described since ancient times. The lifetime cost per child with FAS in the US was $2,000,000 in 2002. The term fetal alcohol syndrome was first used in 1973. Types FASDs encompass a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. The most severe condition is called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis. Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types. Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol- related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS. The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure, such as spontaneous abortion and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders. It is unclear if identifying a FASD-related condition benefits the individual. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association introduced, neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE) into the DSM-V as a \\"condition for further study\\" and as a specified condition under, \\"other specified neurodevelopmental disorders\\" as a way to better study the behavioral aspects of all FASD disorders. Though similar sounding ND-PAE is the spectrum-wide term for the psychiatric, behavioral, and neurological symptoms of all FASD's, where as ARND, is the specific diagnosis of the non- dysmorphic type of FASD where a majority of the symptoms are witnessed. Signs and symptoms Facial characteristics of a child with FAS The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum. The central nervous system damage criteria particularly lacks clear consensus. A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems. More than 400 problems, however, can occur with FASD. =Growth= In terms of FASD, growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a premature infant), and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements. Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.Clinical growth charts. National Center for Growth Statistics. Retrieved on 2007-04-10 Prenatal or postnatal presentation of growth deficits can occur, but are most often postnatal. Criteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM diagnostic system (\\"low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height\\" p. 4 of executive summary), while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency. The \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile. Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy. Growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\":Astley, S.J. (2004). Diagnostic Guide for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Seattle: University of Washington. PDF available at FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network . Retrieved on 2007-04-11. * Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile. * Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both. * Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. * None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile. In the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome. That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. This suggests growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage. =Facial features= Several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS. The presence of FAS facial features indicates brain damage, although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non- diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th to 20th week of gestation. Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics. The three FAS facial features are: * A smooth philtrum: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. * Thin vermilion: The upper lip thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. * Small palpebral fissures: Eye width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,Lip-philtrum guides .

Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother.West, J.R. (Ed.) (1986). Alcohol and Brain Development. New York: Oxford University Press. While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments. All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a \\"complex pattern\\" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND. The \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND. The \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse. The \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks: * Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy. * Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains. * Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains or by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed. * Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage. Structural Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia). Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts. Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly. Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely. During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of brain cells, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain. During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well. As of 2002, there were 25 reports of autopsies on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth. The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere.Mattson, S.N., & Riley, E.P. (2002). \\"Neurobehavioral and Neuroanatomical Effects of Heavy Prenatal Exposure to Alcohol,\\" in Streissguth and Kantor. (2002). p. 10. In 1977, Dr. Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly. Neurological When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as meningitis, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc. All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely. Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, and poor hand - eye coordination. Many soft signs have norm- referenced criteria, while others are determined through clinical judgment. \\"Clinical judgment\\" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both. Functional When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments. Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems. The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis: * Evidence of a complex pattern of behavior or cognitive abnormalities inconsistent with developmental level in the following CNS domains ‚Äì Sufficient for a pFAS or ARND diagnosis using IOM guidelines ** Learning disabilities, academic achievement, impulse control, social perception, communication, abstraction, math skills, memory, attention, judgment * Performance at two or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains ‚Äì Sufficient for an FAS, pFAS or static encephalopathy diagnosis using 4-Digit Diagnostic Code ** Executive functioning, memory, cognition, social/adaptive skills, academic achievement, language, motor skills, attention, activity level * General cognitive deficits (e.g., IQ) at or below the 3rd percentile on standardized testing ‚Äì Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines * Performance at or below the 16th percentile on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains ‚Äì Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines ** Cognition, executive functioning, motor functioning, attention and hyperactive problems, social skills, sensory processing disorder, social communication, memory, difficulties responding to common parenting practices * Performance at two or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the following CNS domains ‚Äì Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using Canadian guidelines ** Cognition, communication, academic achievement, memory, executive functioning, adaptive behavior, motor skills, social skills, social communication =Related signs= Other conditions may commonly co- occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, these conditions are considered alcohol-related birth defects and not diagnostic criteria for FAS. * Heart: A heart murmur that frequently disappears by one year of age. Ventricular septal defect most commonly seen, followed by an atrial septal defect. * Bones: Joint anomalies including abnormal position and function, altered palmar crease patterns, small distal phalanges, and small fifth fingernails. * Kidneys: Horseshoe, aplastic, dysplastic, or hypoplastic kidneys. * Eyes: Strabismus, optic nerve hypoplasia (which may cause light sensitivity, decreased visual acuity, or involuntary eye movements). * Occasional problems: ptosis of the eyelid, microphthalmia, cleft lip with or without a cleft palate, webbed neck, short neck, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus. Cause Fetal alcohol syndrome 1) Alcohol consumed (EtOH) 2) Alcohol crosses into the placenta 3) Alcohol metabolizes 4) fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in meconium Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is caused by a woman consuming alcohol while pregnant. Alcohol crosses through the placenta to the unborn child and can interfere with normal development. Alcohol is a teratogen (causes birth defects) and there is no known safe amount of alcohol to consume while pregnant and there is no known safe time during pregnancy to consume alcohol to prevent birth defects such as FASD. Evidence of harm from low levels of alcohol consumption is not clear and since there are not known safe amounts of alcohol, women are suggested to completely abstain from drinking when trying to get pregnant and while pregnant. Small amounts of alcohol may not cause an abnormal appearance, however, small amounts of alcohol consumption while pregnant may cause milder symptoms such as behavioral problems and also increases the risk of miscarriage. Among those women who are alcoholic, an estimated one-third of their children have FAS. There is evidence supporting the theory that the father can cause FAS through long term epigenetic mutation of the father's sperm.Zachariah,V.L & Harding,K.(2019)'Genetic and Epigenetic Perspectives on the Role of Fathers in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', CanFASD, retrieved from https://canfasd.ca/wp-content/uploads/publications/Fathers-Role-1-Issue-Paper- Final.pdf, Mechanism Despite intense research efforts, the exact mechanism for the development of FAS or FASD is unknown. On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification. Genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of long-lasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific; with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations. A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption: # The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is practically absent with respect to ethanol. # The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised. # Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose. For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the liver, whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage. Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the fetus remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like SOD, glutathione transferases, and glutathion peroxidases, resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective. Diagnosis Because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome. As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America: * The Institute of Medicine's guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure; * The University of Washington's \\"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a Likert scale of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings; * The Centers for Disease Control's \\"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis\\", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions;Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (PDF). CDC (July 2004). Retrieved on 2019-10-19 and * Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems. Each diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \\"full-blown FAS\\". While the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions. The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD. Thus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of ten domains of brain functioning. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \\"FAS face\\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as ADHD or oppositional defiance disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an ICD or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage. =Fetal alcohol syndrome= The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis: # Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile # FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present # Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, or functional impairment # Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech- language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual. =Partial FAS= Partial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \\"look\\" less like FAS. The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS: # Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient # FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present # Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains # Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure =Fetal alcohol effects= Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects. It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies. Smith (1981) described FAE as an \\"extremely important concept\\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features. This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental. Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.Malbin, D. (2002). Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Trying Differently Rather Than Harder. Portland, Oregon: FASCETS, Inc. . The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy: # Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient # FAS facial features: Minimal or no FAS facial features present # Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains # Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure;0 Alcohol-related birth defects Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE), was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD. PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.Streissguth, A. (1997). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Guide for Families and Communities. Baltimore: Brookes Publishing. . The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD. =Exposure= Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), chemical biomarkers, or other reliable sources. Exposure level is assessed as confirmed exposure, unknown exposure, and confirmed absence of exposure by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The \\"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as High Risk and Some Risk: * High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high blood alcohol levels (100 mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. * Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns. * Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy. * No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Confirmed exposure Amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic. The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \\"heavy alcohol use\\" is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2000). National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Tenth special report to the U.S Congress on alcohol and health: Highlights frfom current research. Washington, DC: The Institute. \\"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as high risk and some risk. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 100 mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55 kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting. Unknown exposure For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing. In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels. Confirmed absence of exposure Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least suspected to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.  Biomarkers  Evidence is insufficient for the use of chemical biomarkers to detect prenatal alcohol exposure. Biomarkers being studied include fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in the meconium (first feces of an infant) and hair. FAEE may be present if chronic alcohol exposure occurs during the 2nd and 3rd trimester since this is when the meconium begins to form. Concentrations of FAEE can be influence by medication use, diet, and individual genetic variations in FAEE metabolism however. =Ten brain domains= A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-√†-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities. The proposed Ten Brain Domains include: *Achievement, adaptive behavior, attention, cognition, executive functioning, language, memory, motor skills, multisensory integration or soft neurological problems, social communication The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.FADP ‚Äì Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program =Differential diagnosis= The CDC reviewed nine syndromes that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure: *Aarskog syndrome *Williams syndrome *Noonan syndrome *Dubowitz syndrome *Brachman-DeLange syndrome *Toluene syndrome *Fetal hydantoin syndrome *Fetal valproate syndrome *Maternal PKU fetal effects Other disorders that have similar symptoms may include: *Attention deficit hyperactive disorder *Autism spectrum disorder *Reactive attachment disorder *Oppositional defiant disorder *Sensory integration dysfunction *Bipolar disorder *Depression *Asperger's syndrome Prevention The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy. In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be aware that she has conceived. The Centers for Disease Control and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommend no alcohol during pregnancy. In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act. There is some controversy surrounding the \\"zero- tolerance\\" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts. In addition, special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease, as prevalence and causation is often linked with FASD, which is more common and causes less harm, as opposed to FAS. Treatment There is no cure for FASD, but treatment is possible. Early intervention from birth to age 3 has been shown to improve the development of a child born with FASD. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone. =Medication= Psychoactive drugs are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably ADHD. =Behavioral interventions= Behavioral interventions are based on the learning theory, which is the basis for many parenting and professional strategies and interventions. Along with ordinary parenting styles, such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with ADHD), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in special education services, which also utilizes principles of learning theory, behavior modification, and outcome-based education. =Developmental framework= Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on developmental psychology, even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, John Bowlby's attachment framework, and other developmental stage theories). FAS interferes with normal development, which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS. By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions. =Advocacy model= The advocacy model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS. Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or case manager) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals. The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the person's progress at school.Buxton, B. (2005). Damaged Angels: An Adoptive Mother Discovers the Tragic Toll of Alcohol in Pregnancy. New York: Carroll & Graf. . An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a community practice level as well.National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Minnesota Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Retrieved on 2007-04-11 =Public health and policy= Treating FAS at the public health and public policy level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of public resources to assist those with FAS. It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during OB/GYN or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention. The US Centers for Disease Control estimates 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommended that women of child-bearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this. Prognosis =Primary disabilities= The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.Streissguth, A.P., Barr, H.M., Kogan, J., & Bookstein, F.L. (1996). Understanding the occurrence of secondary disabilities in clients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE): Final report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Grant No. RO4/CCR008515 (Tech. Report No. 96-06). Seattle: University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol and Drug Unit. Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as behavior problems, but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty,Malbin, D. (1993). Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Effects: Strategies for Professionals. Center City, MN: Hazelden. rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability. The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but animal studies have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure. Representative examples include: * Learning impairments are associated with impaired dendrites of the hippocampus * Impaired motor development and functioning are associated with reduced size of the cerebellum * Hyperactivity is associated with decreased size of the corpus callosum Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include:McCreight, B. (1997). Recognizing and Managing Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects: A Guidebook. Washington, DC: CWLA. . Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties. * Achievement: Learning disabilities * Adaptive behavior: Poor impulse control, poor personal boundaries, poor anger management, stubbornness, intrusive behavior, too friendly with strangers, poor daily living skills, developmental delays * Attention: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), poor attention or concentration, distractible * Cognition: Intellectual disability, confusion under pressure, poor abstract skills, difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, slower cognitive processing * Executive functioning: Poor judgment, Information-processing disorder, poor at perceiving patterns, poor cause and effect reasoning, inconsistent at linking words to actions, poor generalization ability * Language: Expressive or receptive language disorders, grasp parts but not whole concepts, lack understanding of metaphor, idioms, or sarcasm * Memory: Poor short-term memory, inconsistent memory and knowledge base * Motor skills: Poor handwriting, poor fine motor skills, poor gross motor skills, delayed motor skill development (e.g., riding a bicycle at appropriate age) * Sensory processing and soft neurological problems: sensory processing disorder, sensory defensiveness, undersensitivity to stimulation * Social communication: Intrude into conversations, inability to read nonverbal or social cues, \\"chatty\\" but without substance =Secondary disabilities= The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services. Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder): * Mental health problems: Diagnosed with ADHD, Clinical Depression, or other mental illness, experienced by over 90% of the subjects * Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) * Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) * Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) * Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) * Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older) Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults: * Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) * Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) =Protective factors and strengths= Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities: * Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life * Being diagnosed with FAS before age six * Never having experienced violence * Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years * Experiencing a \\"good quality home\\" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old * Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services * Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life * Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition) Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning: *Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry *Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities = Lifespan = One study found that the people with FASD had a significantly shorter life expectancy. Epidemiology FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. The lifetime costs of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002. Drinking any quantity during pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to a child with FASD is about 15%, and to a child with FAS about 1.5%. Drinking large quantities, defined as 2 standard drinks a day, or 6 standard drinks in a short time, carries a 50% risk of a FAS birth. =Australia = FASD among Australian youth is more common in indigenous Australians. The only states that have registered birth defects in Australian youth are Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In Australia, only 12% of Australian health professionals are aware of the diagnostics and symptoms of FASD. In Western Australia, the rate of births resulting in FASD is 0.02 per 1,000 births for non-Indigenous Australians, however among indigenous births the rate is 2.76 per 1,000 births. In Victoria, there have been no registered FASD related births for indigenous Australians, but the rate for the general population in Victoria is 0.01‚Äì0.03 per 1000 births. There have been no dedicated FASD clinics within Western Australia, but there are also no nationally supported diagnostic criteria anywhere in Australia. Passive surveillance is a prevention technique used within Australia to assist in monitoring and establishing detectable defects during pregnancy and childhood. History From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College.Armstrong, E. M. (2003). Conceiving risk, bearing responsibility: Fetal alcohol syndrome & the diagnosis of moral disorder. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. \\"Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued.\\"King, T. L., & Brucker, M. C. (2011). Pharmacology for women's health. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett. Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was \\"a brutal procedure for all involved.\\" Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD. =Historical references= Anecdotal accounts of prohibitions against maternal alcohol use from Biblical, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman sources imply a historical awareness of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes. For example, in the Bible, Judges 13:4 (addressed to a woman who was going to have a baby) reads: \\"Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean\\" (ESV). In 1725 British physicians petitioned the House of Commons on the effects of strong drink when consumed by pregnant women saying that such drinking is ‚Äú‚Ä¶ too often the cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be, instead of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country.‚Äù. Biography of author Randle Jackson There are many other such historical references. In Gaelic Scotland, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Martin Martin). Claims that alcohol consumption caused idiocy were part of the Teetotalism's message in the 19th century,Jonathan Townley Crane, Arts of Intoxication: The Aim and the Results. (New York:Carlton & Lanahan, 1870), 173‚Äì175 but such claims, despite some attempts to offer evidence, were ignored because no mechanism could be advanced.Jennifer L. Tait The Poisoned Chalice (Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 2010), 27,28. The earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a Liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use. This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded. A case study by Henry H. Goddard of the Kallikak family‚Äîpopular in the early 1900s‚Äîrepresents this earlier perspective,Goddard, H.H. (1912). The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble- Mindedness. New York: Macmillan. though later researchers have suggested that the Kallikaks almost certainly had FAS. General studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid-1900s were typically based on a heredity argument.Haggard, H.W., & Jellinek, E.M. (1942). Alcohol Explored. New York: Doubleday. Prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973, only a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy or breast-feeding and those who did not, and identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity. =Recognition as a syndrome= Fetal alcohol syndrome was named in 1973 by two dysmorphologists, Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and David Weyhe Smith of the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle, United States. They identified a pattern of \\"craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay\\" in eight unrelated children of three ethnic groups, all born to mothers who were alcoholics. The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal. News of the discovery shocked some, while others were skeptical of the findings.Streissguth, A.P. (2002). In A. Streissguth, & J. Kanter (Eds.), The Challenge in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Overcoming Secondary Disabilities. Seattle: University of WA Press. . Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France had already published a study in a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics, Reprinted in and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968‚Äì1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers. The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979. Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner. Within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. Sterling Clarren, had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of intellectual disability. While many syndromes are eponymous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Dr. Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms.Clarren, S.K. (2005). A thirty year journey from tragedy to hope. Foreword to Buxton, B. (2005). Damaged Angels: An Adoptive Mother Discovers the Tragic Toll of Alcohol in Pregnancy. New York: Carroll & Graf. . He reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention, believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome, then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from patient education and public awareness. At the time, nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from FAS or its rate of prevalence. Over time, as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) was developed to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Currently, FAS is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and assigned ICD-9 and diagnoses. In fiction In Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World (where all fetuses are gestated in vitro in a factory), lower caste fetuses are created by receiving alcohol transfusions to reduce intelligence and height, thus conditioning them for simple, menial tasks. It is noteworthy that Huxley's description of the more obvious effects predates official medical recognition (1973) by more than four decades, and are thus are likely to have been inspired by historical accounts. The main character of the 2009 film Defendor is implied to have the condition.

Davis became popular in United States by fighting often on television. She fought in various areas of the country, including Nevada, California, and much of the Northwest. Her only bouts that would ultimately be officially recognized, however, would be five bouts which were held in the Northeast. Career Davis made history in August 1978, by becoming the first, and, until Ronda Rousey in January 2016, only woman to be on the cover of Ring Magazine. Some of her fights were televised by ABC or NBC, and she sort of became a symbol for those women who were involved in the feminist movement of the era. She suffered a devastating personal defeat, however, when a scandal broke out, revealing that some of her fights had been fixed. According to investigation, she may have been involved herself on the process of fixing some of her fights. It is because of that, that only five of her fights are currently recognized as legitimate bouts.

Later life Officially, her first fight occurred on November 11, 1977, when she knocked out Margie Dunson in the first round, in North Carolina and then defeated three more times after that. On June 7, 1978, she and Ernestine Jones fought to a no contest in a bout that was scheduled for four rounds. She won two more fights before the end of the 1970s. In part stressed by the scandal that surrounded her, she retired in 1981 after her final match. On March 27, 2003, Sue TL Fox of WBAN interviewed Cathy \\"Cat\\" Davis, and Davis spoke to her about what she was doing since retiring from boxing. Davis said, \\"Just after I retired, I returned to University to study Sports Psychology/Philosophy. I had been recruited by the coach of the National Championship San Jose State fencing team so it was an easy choice of where to study. So I fenced and studied happily. Then my other love came to the fore when I started to work in a 4 Star French Restaurant to support myself. I had been taught to cook by my Grandmother since I was very young and it had always been something I loved to do for friends. Now I was working my way up the ladder of a tough profession that, at that time, had few women. Obviously, that didn't stop me in boxing, so why should it stop me in cooking? I loved the challenge and learned quickly. In 1988 I took a life changing vacation. An old fencing buddy who was South African invited me to her country. I left for a 3 week trip and ended up staying 3 years. During that time I cooked in a wild game lodge and had the pleasure of raising a cheetah and a lion. What an exciting place to live. I returned to California but just couldn't get Africa out of my mind. It had gotten into my blood. So I returned to stay and work in 1999. I'm now a cooking teacher for a luxury game lodge company which is a leader in the field of conservation. It gives my job even more meaning to work for a concerned company. I am responsible for the food in a dozen lodges and work with wonderful people who are so happy to learn. I travel and live all over southern and East Africa living the most extraordinary life. Sometimes I have to pinch myself just to make sure it's not a dream. I have truly found my place in the world.‚Äù References External links * Bibliography *A History of Women's Boxing, Malissa Smith, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2014, *THE GREAT WHITE HYPE By Jack Newfield - Published November 1979 Volume.

It is located in the suburb of Strathmore Park, Wellington, New Zealand. Under the leadership of an Executive Headmaster, the College comprises three schools, the Preparatory School for Years 1 to 6, the Middle School for Years 7 to 10 and the Senior School for Years 11 to 13. Each school has its own Principal and Staff. Scots College is an IB World College. History It was founded as a Presbyterian boys' college in 1916 by Rev Dr James Gibb and the Hon John Aitken on the current campus of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, and moved to the present site in Strathmore in 1920. Dr Gibb's vision was the creation of a Christian college that would be independent of the secular state system. It is the 'sister' school of Queen Margaret College in Thorndon, Wellington. The college's Scots heritage is reflected in its ceremonies (often involving a piper leading a procession into its hall) and school song. College prefects wear kilts on official occasions and every Friday for chapel. The school tartan is that of the Clan Fergusson. Permission to wear the tartan was granted by the late Governor General Sir Charles Fergusson. The Main Block has a Category II listing with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Houses Students in the Middle and Senior Schools (Years 7‚Äì13) are organized into eight \\"houses\\". Each house reflects an important part of the people who have contributed to Scots College over its history. The houses have expanded three times since the founding of the school ‚Äì two houses were added to the original two in 1961/1963, another two in 1993 with the boarders' house (Gibb) being removed at this time as well, and a further two added in 2009. There are major competitions in swimming, cross-country, music, athletics, and other weekly house sport games, such as hockey and touch rugby. The two original houses were Aitken (Blue, named in honour of founding father Hon John Aitken) and Fergusson (Green, named in honour of General Sir Charles Fergusson), with Glasgow (Red, named in honour of former Headmaster K W R Glasgow) and MacKenzie (Yellow, named in honour of Elsie MacKenzie, Former mistress of the Junios Department of Scots College) being established next, followed by Plimmer (Sky Blue, named in honour of the John Plimmer and his family, whose four grandchildren were enrolled as boarders in 1916) and Uttley (Black, named in honour of Scots College's first Headmaster Dr George Uttley) in 1993 and Smith (Navy Blue, in honour of Alexander Pringle Smith) and Mawson (Maroon, named in honour of Brigadier John Mawson, a past student and Scots College Old Boys' Association President) established in 2009. The Preparatory School (Years 1‚Äì6) maintains four houses: Potatau (Blue), Bedding (Green), Macarthur (Red) and McKelvie (Yellow). In 2004 there was an announcement of a change to the current House names in the hopes of giving the Preparatory School a better sense of historical identity; Potatau named after the writer of the School haka, McKelvie named in honour of past parent and Board of Governors member Lynn McKelvie, Bedding names in honour of past student Geoff Bedding and Macarthur named after the first student at Scots College Ian Hannay Macarthur. Campus facilities Recent projects on campus have been the science block, opened in 2006 by Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse and the Aitken (Admin/Reception) block in 2009. Other facilities updated in the last few years include the Leslie Shelly Lecture Theatre and the Information Centre, and an extension to Gibb House, the school's Boarding House. The Hodge Sports Centre (HSC) was opened on 4 November 2011, and the Creative Performing Arts Centre (CPAC) was opened on 2 March 2012. The College introduced Flexible Learning environments to its campus during 2017 including a tertiary style 'Hub' offering flexible spaces for teaching, student collaboration and a common room for senior students. Additional new Boarding Houses were opened in 2015 and 2018 to house the growing number of boarding students. Opened in 2012 is a purpose built Creative and Performing Arts Centre. The Creative and Performing Arts Centre provides a new Pipe Band facility, recording studio, Drama rooms, Music rooms, Middle School administration area, offices, Art and Graphics rooms. Flexible Learning Environments have been introduced to the College over previous years. These spaces help facilitate collaboration and project based learning. They provide teachers and students with areas to learn in large and small groups, collaborate and break away for independent study. The latest campus development is the McKinnon Block, named in honour of former Headmaster Ian McKinnon and his wife Jenny. Opened in 2012 by Her Excellency the Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy Governor General of New Zealand. Included in the building are facilities for Food Science to allow for its introduction to the curriculum. A fabrication lab with state of the art model and design equipment that brings us in alignment with leading NZ universities. The girls‚Äô pastoral care facilities are also located in this block with their own tertiary style common room. The school also has IB World School status and maintains an IB curriculum from PYP to Diploma. The current IB Diploma co-ordinator is Mike McKnight and the MYP co-ordinator is Kate Bondett. Boarding The boarding house (titled Gibb House, after the founder of the school) has accommodation for approximately 130 students. The majority of these students are in Years 9‚Äì13 however allowance has been made occasionally for Year 7 and 8 students to board full-time. The current boarding director is Gary Henley-Smith, with assistant house masters Nick Sinnamon and Marc Capstick, and matrons Tania Steadman and Blossom Cameron. In addition, gap year tutors are lodged in the boarding house and assist with day-to-day operations. Connections with other schools Scots College 1st XV is currently playing in the Premier I rugby division. In 2014 the 1st XV won the NZ Secondary School Championship ‚Äì a joint win with Hamilton Boys High School. In 2015 they represented New Zealand at the SANIX Rugby Youth Cup tournament in Japan where they placed third. Students competing for the 1st XV in traditional fixtures perform a special haka written by an old boy; this is distinct from the school haka. Scots College is the brother school to the slightly younger Queen Margaret College, which now sites itself in the original Scots College building. Often there are various socials and sporting matches against local schools, organised by College Sport Wellington. In addition, both sections of the school have inter- school fixtures with other secondary schools, notably Lindisfarne and primary schools such as Huntley School.

Accepting girls and boys in Years 1-13. This chnage is part of the College's Future Focussed Learning Strategy and preparing students for their futures in an evolving world. In January 2018, School Headmaster Graeme Yule announced that Scots College Senior School will become a co-educational school, meaning it will accept both girls and boys to enroll. The change will begin in 2020, when 60 Year 11 to 13 female students will join the Senior School and graduate as the first mixed-sex group from 2021. The integration would expand each year to a total of 150 girls by 2022. Controversies In November 2007, several graduating students were banned from end-of-year prizes for growing moustaches as part of the fund-raising campaign 'Movember', established by The Movember Foundation, to raise awareness for prostate cancer. The college threatened to ban a senior student from their NCEA examinations (official secondary school qualification) for growing a moustache during November. In September 2010, Scots College expelled seven students and suspended five for involvement in a drug ring within the college. Some involved in using and dealing the illegal substances were as young as 13. In October 2013, ten Scots College students from Year 11 to 13, including prefects, were caught illegally consuming alcohol on a school trip to Fiji. School Headmaster Graeme Yule recognised the actions as 'relatively minor' and suspended students for less than a week. In April 2019, Headmaster Graham Yule was accused of making \\"sexist\\" comments after he said prospective female students would not be allowed to \\"sit at the back of the class painting their nails\\" once the school becomes co- educational. He also commented on the importance women gave to the size of mirrors while talking about construction of the new girls' bathroom.

It is located near the village of Allouis. Allouis transmitter It broadcast the France Inter public radio station from October 1952 until 31 December 2016. Since 2017, it broadcasts only the TDF time signal, which has been renamed ALS162 since 2017. The first transmitter, built in 1939 during the Phoney War, used an aerial with four masts and a transmitter rated at 500 kilowatts.Chronologie des radios fran√ßaises en ondes longues 1921‚Äì2000 (\\"Chronology of french long-wave transmitters 1921‚Äì2000\\") It was destroyed in 1944 during the scorched earth retreat by German forces. On 19 October 1952 a new 250 kW transmitter came into service. This used a special cage aerial, mounted on a 308-metre (1010') high earthed mast. In 1957 the transmission power was increased to 600 kW, in 1974 to 1,000 kW, and in 1981 to 2,000 kW. Transmission power is reduced to 1,000 kW during the hours of darkness. In 1974 the aerial was renewed. The cage aerials were removed and the mast height was increased to 350 m (1150'). A second mast of the same height was constructed at the same time. In 1977, the current phase modulated time signal was added to the transmissions. The broadcast frequency, formerly 164 kHz, was changed to 163.840 kHz (the 5th harmonic of the common 32768 Hz timekeeping frequency) to be a more convenient frequency standard. In 1980, the first atomic clock was installed to regulate the carrier frequency.Les r√©- orientations On 1 February 1986, the frequency was changed to its current value of 162 kHz (still an accurately controlled frequency standard) to bring it to a multiple of 9 kHz in accordance with the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975. The radio channel France Inter announced during 2016 that the channel would discontinue transmitting on the 162 kHz frequency on 1 January 2017, seeking cost savings of approximately 6 million Euros per year. The transmission of the TDF time signal will be continued after this date, as this time signal is critical for over 300,000 devices, which are deployed within French enterprises and state entities, like the French railways SNCF, the electricity distributor ENEDIS, airports, hospitals, municipalities, et cetera.Le signal horaire restera sur le 162 kHz de France InterL'√©metteur d'Allouis passe aussi √† l'heure d'√©t√© cette nuit The transmitter is owned by T√©l√©Diffusion de France and the provisioning of the ALS162 time signal is a joint responsibility of ANFR (state body for radio frequencies), the trade body France Horlogerie and the LNE-SYRTE and LNE-LTFB time laboratories.Provision of the legal time by ALS162 signal References External links http://perso.wanadoo.fr/tvignaud/am/allouis/fr- allouis.htm * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b44247 * http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b58020 Category:Radio masts and towers in Europe Category:Buildings and structures in Cher (department) Category:Transmitter sites in France Category:Time signal radio stations ","title":"Allouis longwave transmitter"},{"id":"1248942","text":"Alexis Ann Thorpe (born April 19, 1980), is an American actress.

The porous soil has a water table deep underground with an estimated one billion litres of fresh water. The Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 raised the salt content of the ground water. The tsunami destroyed parts of the town and submerged some parts with seawater up to 4 feet deep. The town came briefly under the control of the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) during the early 1990s, until the Sri Lankan Army recaptured it in 1995. Etymology The place name of Point Pedro is a corruption of the Portuguese \\"Ponta das Pedras\\" meaning \\"the rocky cape\\". The name of the town in Tamil is Paruthithurai, which literally mean \\"Cotton Harbour\\". The harbor exported cotton to South India for centuries. History =Ancient history= Vallipuram, a village nearby was an ancient settlement with rich archeological remains. During pre- colonial and colonial times Point Pedro was a trading port. There is a large number of people in and around Point Pedro who trace their families to local traders, called Sambangarar, '‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Øç' in Tamil, meaning 'ship people'. =Portuguese history= There are several Catholic churches built around Point Pedro along the coasts and in Nelliady. Sacred Heart College is a major Catholic high school situated in Nelliady. Point Pedro- Northernmost point of Sri Lanka =Dutch colonial history= In the 17th Century Philippus Baldaeus, a Christian missionary from the Netherlands, settled in Jaffna following the Dutch occupation of Ceylon. He documented the lives and customs of the Tamil people of Northern Ceylon. His studies were published in the Netherlands and later in Germany. In Point Pedro's market there is a stone inscription commemorating Baldeus giving lessons from the Bible under a tamarind tree. The tree was uprooted by a cyclone in 1962. =British colonial legacy= Wesleyan missionaries from Great Britain established schools in the area including Hartley College and the Methodist Girls High School. There are American mission schools at Uduppiddy and Thunnalai. Heritage sites Heritage sites in Point Pedro include the lighthouse, the hill of St. Lourdes church of Thumpalai and Vallipuram temple. =Harbour= Point Pedro has a small harbour, which is controlled by the Sri Lankan army. If the much-delayed and frequently re-planned Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is completed, deepening the Palk Straits between India and Sri Lanka to allow larger ships to pass, rather than having to travel around Sri Lanka, then Point Pedro and other ports in the Jaffna peninsula may see a significant increase in maritime trade, especially with India. Education Schools in the town include Hartley College, Velautham Maha Vidyalayam, Vadamarachchi Hindu Girls' College and Methodist Girls High School.

The Tuwharetoa tangata whenua claim an ‚Äúoral tradition‚Äù of the place as a k≈çhatu (rock). A popular theory is that the wall is a human construction. From that popular theory, a pseudoscience theory explains the wall as a pre-MƒÅori civilization artifact. The wall formation was inspected by an anthropologist and a geologist; neither saw evidence of a human origin. In a preliminary investigation, anthropologist Neville Ritchie of the New Zealand Department of Conservation, observed \\"matching micro-irregularities along the joints.\\" This indicated that the blocks in the wall were too perfectly matched. He also observed the joints were neither straight nor truly horizontal nor perpendicular, indicating the joint alignments were too poorly constructed. Ritchie concluded the blocks are a natural formation based on the presence of matching micro-irregularities in blocks and imperfect joint alignment. Peter Wood, of the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences at Wairakei, inspected the blocks for an afternoon and concluded they are natural fractures in what Wood termed \\"Jointed-Rangitaiki-Ignimbrite,\\" and described as \\"330,000 year old volcanic rock that is common in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.\\" Both vertical and horizontal joints are common. Fractures in the Rangitaiki ignimbrite formed when it cooled and contracted after flowing into place during an eruption.

Early life Johns was born and grew up in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. After serving as a deckhand in the South African navy during World War II, he worked for a time in accountancy, but soon became involved in amateur theatre. Career In 1948, Johns bought a one-way ticket to Britain and learned his craft working in repertory theatre at Southend-on-Sea for almost five years. He began to appear in British films from the mid-1950s, including a bit part in the classic Ealing comedy The Ladykillers (1955). He ran a small hotel in London during the 1950s, and was a member of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre during the Angry Young Men period when new playwrights, including John Osborne, introduced new themes to British theatre. His most famous character, Barlow, was noted for his hard edges, owing much to the changes in characterisation pioneered at the Royal Court. In 1962 he won the part of Barlow in Z-Cars and soon became one of the most familiar and popular faces on British television. During the long run (1962‚Äì1965) of Z-Cars, he transferred his character to the spin-off series, Softly, Softly (1966‚Äì1969), and later Softly, Softly: Taskforce (1969‚Äì1972). He also played the voice of the mysterious \\"Guvner\\" in The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery (1966). He was the subject of This Is Your Life in October 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at BBC Television Centre. In the 1970s he starred in a third spin-off series, Barlow at Large (1971,1973), which saw the character transferred to British Intelligence: it was later retitled simply Barlow (1974‚Äì1975). Although the Barlow character remained popular (and appeared in another spin-off, in which he investigated the Jack the Ripper murders), ratings for these solo spin-offs declined, and the final series ended in 1975. Barlow was seen once more in 1976, in the series Second Verdict. Johns appeared as President of the Council Bradshaw in the 1970 award-winning film Cromwell with Richard Harris in the role of Cromwell and Sir Alec Guinness as King Charles I. In 1973 Johns was named BBC TV Personality of the Year by the Variety Club of Great Britain. He portrayed the apartheid-supporting Namib mine superintendent Mr. Zimmerman in two episodes of the 1985 mini-series Master of the Game. Johns later appeared in the much- maligned Ken Russell films Salome's Last Dance and The Lair of the White Worm (both 1988), followed by the title-character in the mid-1980s Channel 4 series Brond. His many stage credits include Daddy Warbucks in the original West End run of Annie ‚Äì he can be heard on the original London cast album ‚Äì and the Ghost of Christmas Present in the original Birmingham cast of the stage adaptation of the film musical Scrooge (1970), on the recording of which he can also be heard. His guest appearances on TV include The Avengers, Department S, Neverwhere, the Doctor Who serial Four to Doomsday (1982) and the Blake's 7 episode \\"Games\\". He had a prominent role as Calpurnius Piso in the BBC's acclaimed adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius (1976); he played Magwitch in the BBC's 1981 adaptation of Dickens' Great Expectations, and the jailer in The Secret Life of Albie Sachs. Johns appeared in the 1984 pop video for 'Young at Heart' recorded by The Bluebells. With him were veteran Scottish actress Molly Weir and Scots singer/actress Clare Grogan. In 1993, Johns appeared in the BBC period drama Scarlet and Black alongside a young Ewan McGregor and Rachel Weisz. He was also the author of the children's book Gumphlumph; in the mid-1960s, at the height of his fame as Barlow, he read it on the children's television series Jackanory. Gumphlumph would be revived, again with Johns narrating, for the TV-am children's programme Rub-A-Dub-Tub in the 1980s. Personal life He married Nanette Ryder in 1955; they had four children. He ran the small hotel in St Martins Lane called the St Martins Hotel; it was managed by Elizabeth Kissick-Jones, formerly Hartnell, who was the aunt of his wife Nanette. The hotel was very popular with actors and he ran it until 1976. After several years of poor health, Johns died from heart disease in 2002, aged 76.

Shearing shed, meat house and shearers' quarters on a station, Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia. A sheep shearer is a worker who uses (hand-powered)-blade or machine shears to remove wool from domestic sheep during crutching or shearing. History During the early years of sheep breeding in Australia, shearing was carried out by shepherds, assigned servants, Ticket of Leave men, and free labourers using blade shears. As the sheep industry expanded, more shearers were required. Although the demand had increased, the conditions had not, and shearers had to contend with terrible working conditions, very long hours and low pay. In 1888, Australia became the first country in the world have a complete shearing, at Dunlop Station, finished using machines. By 1915, most large Australian sheep station shearing sheds had machines that were powered by steam engines. Later, internal combustion engines powered machines until rural power supplies became available. Sheep shearing today In most countries like Australia with large sheep flocks, the shearer is one of a contractor's team that go from property to property shearing sheep and preparing the wool for market. A workday starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four ‚Äúruns‚Äù of two hours each. ‚ÄúSmoko‚Äù breaks of a half hour each are at 9:30 am and again at 3 pm. The lunch break is taken at 12 midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece rate, i.e., per sheep. The shearer collects a sheep from a catching pen, positions it on his ‚Äústand‚Äù on the shearing board and operates the shearing hand-piece. A shearer begins by removing the wool over the sheep's belly, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout while the sheep is still being shorn. The remainder of the fleece is taken off in one piece by following an efficient set of movements. In the case of powered shears, the movements used are those devised by Godfrey Bowen, in approximately 1950,the Bowen Technique or the Tally-Hi method. In 1963, the Tally-Hi shearing system was developed by Kevin Sarre and the Australian Wool Corporation who promoted the technique using synchronised shearing demonstrations. Sheep struggle less using the Tally-Hi method, reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds shearing each sheep. When finished, the shorn sheep is removed from the board via a chute in the floor, or wall, to a counting out pen, efficiently removing it from the shed. The latest shearing patterns which are used by some of the most efficient shearers around the world, world record holders, world champions, etc. have fewer blows due to better sheep control and positioning. These patterns ensure that there is less strain placed on the sheep and the shearers due to the advanced techniques used. Crutching a sheep that has been wigged (eye-wooled). A professional or \\"gun\\" shearer typically removes a fleece, without badly marking or cutting the sheep, in two to three minutes depending on the size and condition of the sheep, or less than two in elite competitive shearing. Shearers who ‚Äútally‚Äù more than 400 sheep per day when shearing crossbreds, or around 200 for finer wool sheep such as merino, are known as ‚Äúgun shearers‚Äù. Gun shearers using blade shears are usually shearers that have shorn at least 200 sheep in a day. A learner (shearer) is a shearer or intending shearer who has shorn less than a specified number of sheep.Wool and the Nation, Goldsbrough Mort & Co., 1955 In 1983 the Australian shearing industry was torn apart by the wide comb dispute and the ensuing 10-week strike that followed. The offending combs had been introduced by New Zealanders who were weaker union supporters. In 1984, Australia became the last country in the world to permit the use of wide combs, due to previous Australian Workers' Union rulings.Labour History Retrieved on 2009-7-18 The Shear Outback, Australian Shearers' Hall of Fame and museum, was officially opened on 26 January 2001 at Hay, New South Wales in recognition the great wool industry and the great shearers of Australia, especially those of the Outback. The inaugural inductees into the Australian Shearers‚Äô Hall of Fame are Jackie Howe (1861‚Äì1920), Julian Stuart (1866‚Äì1929), Henry Salter MBE (1907‚Äì1997), Kevin Sarre (1933‚Äì1995) and John Hutchinson OAM. These inductees were chosen because they had won world championships or had shorn high tallies.Shear Outback Retrieved on 2009-7-18ABC - Thousands attend Shear Outback opening Retrieved on 2009-7-18 Clothing Shearers' moccasins on a wool rolling table The shearers‚Äô protective clothing and footwear usually includes: * Shearers' jeans or dungarees which have a double thickness of material over the front and lower back leg. * Shearers' singlets: singlets with patches under the arms where the sheep‚Äôs feet are placed during shearing. * Shearers' boots: leather boots with elastic sides or lacing across the front and a flap to prevent the comb catching in the laces or * Shearers' moccasins: a modern synthetic fleece version of the laced boots above, which have a non- slip coating on the sole to prevent slipping on grease in the shearing sheds. These moccasins are washable to prevent the spread of disease and lice etc. Records On 10 October 1892, Jackie Howe set a record of 321 sheep shorn in 7 hours and 40 minutes, using blade shears. He had previously set a weekly aggregate record of 1,437 sheep over a total working week of 44 hours and 30 minutes. While Howe's weekly aggregate record remained until at least 2005, his daily record tally was broken using machine shears by Ted Reick in 1950. Kevin Sarre (1933-1995) was one of the world‚Äôs greatest 20th Century machine shearers. He won many shearing championships including five Australian Titles, was a Golden Shears Winner in 1963 and held World Shearing Record in 1965 of shearing 346 Merinos. In 1963, Kevin in association with the Australian Wool Board, was instrumental in the development of the revolutionary Tally-Hi shearing technique, and went on to supervise the training of this technique throughout Australia. The Tally-Hi shearing technique reduced the time taken to shear a sheep by approximately 30 seconds. Kevin‚Äôs daughter Deanne holds the Australian women‚Äôs shearing record, having shorn 392 sheep in a day.Travelling Exhibition - Kevin Sarre - Shearing Legend Retrieved on 2009-7-18 Henry Salter (1907‚Äì1997) MBE won the first organised shearing contest at Pyramid Hill in 1934 and in 1953 was a machine shearing champion. He continued to use blade shears until he was well into his 80s. In 1946 Salter organised the first Australian shearing school at Kerang, Victoria. During the next 26 years he taught 6,557 students the art of shearing. In 1968 Henry Salter was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the wool industry. John Hutchinson from South Australia is a former Australian Shearing Champion who won the first of six Australian championships and demonstrated shearing at the Osaka World Expo. In 1999 Hutchinson was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his contribution as a shearer trainer and teacher. Australian Dwayne Black holds six world records, mainly in shearing endurance or marathon events. On 6 October 2002 he shore 570 Merino lambs in 9 hours at Yeeramulla, Badgingarra, Western Australia. In April 2005, he spent 9 hours shearing 513 Merino ewes, six more than the previous world record. In October of the same year he shore 519 crossbred lambs at the showground, Bendigo, Victoria. On 2 March 2007, Broomehill shearer Brendan Boyle set the world 24-hour sheep shearing record by shearing 841 full wool Merino sheep, and in the process raised over $20,000 for the fight against prostate cancer. It was the first time a record has been set in 24 hours sheep shearing. However, for the record to be officially recognized, it needs to be overseen by the World Sheep Shearing Records Committee. This committee has a set of rules, and official referees in three member countries for the specific purpose of ensuring records are set under the same rules and consistent referees in these countries. In competition sports shearers, using blades or machine driven hand-pieces, can usually achieve short-term rates that are greater than for day shearers.

The center of her veneration is Saintes-Maries-de- la-Mer, a place of pilgrimage for Roma in the Camargue, in southern France. Legend identifies her as the servant of one of the Three Marys, with whom she is supposed to have arrived in the Camargue.Bart McDowell, Gypsies: Wanderers of the World, pp. 38‚Äì57. Accounts Lorenzo Monaco, The Three Marys at the Tomb Interior of the shrine of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer Ritual bath during the Romani pilgrimage of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. According to various legends, during a persecution of early Christians, commonly placed in the year 42, Lazarus, his sisters Mary and Martha, Mary Salome (the mother of the Apostles John and James), Mary Jacobe and Maximin were sent out to sea in a boat. They arrived safely on the southern shore of Gaul at the place later called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. In some accounts Sarah, a native of Upper Egypt, appears as the black Egyptian maid of one of the Three Marys, usually Mary Jacobe.Michal Droit, Carmague, p. 19. Though the tradition of the Three Marys arriving in France stems from the high Middle Ages, appearing for instance in the 13th century Golden Legend, Saint Sarah makes her first appearance in Vincent Philippon's book The Legend of the Saintes-Maries (1521), where she is portrayed as \\"a charitable woman that helped people by collecting alms, which led to the popular belief that she was a Gypsy.\\" Subsequently, Sarah was adopted by Romani as their saint. Another account has Sarah welcoming the Three Marys into Gaul. Franz de Ville (1956) writes: > One of our people who received the first Revelation was Sara the Kali. She > was of noble birth and was chief of her tribe on the banks of the Rh√¥ne. She > knew the secrets that had been transmitted to her... The Rom at that period > practiced a polytheistic religion, and once a year they took out on their > shoulders the statue of Ishtari (Astarte) and went into the sea to receive > benediction there. One day Sara had visions which informed her that the > Saints who had been present at the death of Jesus would come, and that she > must help them. Sara saw them arrive in a boat. The sea was rough, and the > boat threatened to founder. Mary Salome threw her cloak on the waves and, > using it as a raft, Sarah floated towards the Saints and helped them reach > land by praying.Franz de Ville, Traditions of the Roma in Belgium. Pilgrimage The day of the pilgrimage honouring Sarah is May 24; her statue is carried down to the sea on this day to re-enact her arrival in France. Some authors have drawn parallels between the ceremonies of the pilgrimage and the worship of the Hindu goddess Kali (a form of Durga), subsequently identifying the two.Isabel Fonseca, Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey, pp. 106‚Äì107. Ronald Lee (2001) states: > If we compare the ceremonies with those performed in France at the shrine of > Sainte Sara (called Sara e Kali in Romani), we become aware that the worship > of Kali/Durga/Sara has been transferred to a Christian figure... in France, > to a non-existent \\"sainte\\" called Sara, who is actually part of the > Kali/Durga/Sara worship among certain groups in India.Ronald Lee, \\"The Rom- > Vlach Gypsies and the Kris-Romani\\", p. 210.

Population: 64,800 (1959); 36,000 (1939). History A bird's-eye view Kungur was founded above the Iren's mouth on the banks of the Kungurka in 1648. In 1662, it was burnt by Bashkirs. In 1663, it was rebuilt as a fortress on the place of the village of Mysovskoye. In the beginning of the 18th century, leather and footwear industries started to develop here, and in 1724, a tannery was built. By the mid-18th century, Kungur became one of the most populated areas in the Urals. In 1759, Perm administration of mining plants was moved to Kungur. By the end of the 18th century, Kungur is an important transit trade center of the Siberian road, as well as the center of leather manufacture in Perm Governorate. Kungur rope and linseed oil were widely known. In 1774, the town withstood a siege by Yemelyan Pugachev's Cossack forces. By the end of the 19th century, Kungur had become a significant industrial (including manufacture of leather footwear, gloves, and mittens) and cultural center. In 1890 the Kungurian Age of the Permian Period of geological time was named for Kungur. Soviet arms of Kungur from 1972 =Coat of arms= The town's original coat of arms became official according with the Highest Law of Empress Anna Ioannovna in 1737. Current coat of arms was adopted in 1994.

In the lower part of the town, on Kittarskaya street, is the Uspenskaya Church, built in 1761. On the opposite bank of the Sylva river stands the Preobrazhensky Temple. Tourism and attractions =Kungur Ice Cave= The Kungur Ice Cave is located in the vicinity of Kungur, on the right bank of the Sylva River. Ramified passages stretch under the ground for over 6,000 meters, and only a small part has already been explored. To this day old slides and crumblings do not allow to determine the total length of the passages. In the explored part of the cave there are several dozens of grottoes; the largest one, which is called the Druzhba (Friendship) Grotto, was given its name in honor of the participants of the International Geological Congress who visited the cave in 1937. Inside this grotto there is a lake with the area of 750 m¬≤. The grottoes are \\"adorned\\" with columns of stalagmites and icicles of stalactites up to two meters in height. Over millennia, limestone bearing water has created an infinite variety of forms in the cave, like snowflakes which change in size during the year and reach the size of a maple leaf during late winter. The cave is filled with water from the Sylva River twice a year, in spring and in fall, when it is not accessible to tourists.

This 16th-century painting depicts the Valencia Chalice The Holy Chalice, also known as the Holy Grail, is in Christian tradition the vessel that Jesus used at the Last Supper to serve wine. The Synoptic Gospels refer to Jesus sharing a cup of wine with the Apostles, saying it was the covenant in his blood. The use of wine and chalice in the Eucharist in Christian churches is based on the Last Supper story. In the late 12th century, the author Robert de Boron associated the pre-existing story of the Holy Grail, a magical item from Arthurian literature, with the Holy Chalice. This association was continued in many subsequent Arthurian works, including the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) cycle, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. An ancient cup kept in the Spanish Cathedral of Valencia has been identified since Medieval times as the purported Holy Chalice used at the last supper. https://www.britannica.com/list/10-iconic-churches-in-spain Encyclopedia Britannica Last Supper The Gospel of Matthew (26:27-29) says:Bible gateway, Matthew 26:27 > And He took a cup and when He had given thanks He gave it to them saying > \\"Drink this, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is > poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I shall not > drink again of the fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in My > Father's kingdom.\\" This incident, traditionally known as the Last Supper, is also described by the gospel writers, Mark and Luke, and by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians. With the preceding description of the breaking of bread, it is the foundation for the Eucharist or Holy Communion, celebrated regularly in many Christian churches. The Bible makes no mention of the cup except within the context of the Last Supper and gives no significance whatsoever to the object itself. St. John Chrysostom (347‚Äì407 AD) in his homily on Matthew asserted: > The table was not of silver, the chalice was not of gold in which Christ > gave His blood to His disciples to drink, and yet everything there was > precious and truly fit to inspire awe. The pilgrim Antoninus of Piacenza (AD 570) in his descriptions of the holy places of Jerusalem, said that he saw \\"the cup of onyx, which our Lord blessed at the last supper\\" among many relics displayed at the Basilica erected by Constantine near to Golgotha and the Tomb of Christ. Herbert Thurston in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) concluded that: > No reliable tradition has been preserved to us regarding the vessel used by > Christ at the Last Supper. In the sixth and seventh centuries pilgrims to > Jerusalem were led to believe that the actual chalice was still venerated in > the church of the Holy Sepulchre, having within it the sponge which was > presented to Our Saviour on Calvary.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Chalice.\\" The > Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 27 > Jul. 2013 According to one tradition, Saint Peter brought it to Rome, and passed it on to his successors (the Popes). In 258, when Christians were being persecuted by Emperor Valerian and the Romans demanded that relics be turned over to the government, Pope Sixtus II instead gave the cup to one of his deacons, Saint Lawrence, who passed it to a Spanish soldier, Proselius, with instructions to take it to safety in Lawrence's home country of Spain. Medieval tradition = Iconography = Two episodes from the Passion-cycle murals of √ñja Church, Gotland. The iconic significance of the Chalice grew during the Early Middle Ages. Depictions of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, such as that in the fourteenth-century frescoes of the church at √ñja, Gotland (illustration, right), show a prefigured apparition of the Holy Chalice that stands at the top of the mountain, illustrating the words \\"Let this cup be taken from me\\". Together with the halo-enveloped Hand of God and the haloed figure of Jesus, the halo image atop the chalice, as if of a consecrated communion wafer, completes the Trinity by embodying the Holy Spirit. =Holy Grail= The Holy Grail appears as a miraculous artifact in Arthurian literature in the 12th century, and is soon associated with the Holy Chalice. The \\"Grail\\" became interwoven with the legend of the Holy Chalice. The connection of the Holy Chalice with Joseph of Arimathea dates from Robert de Boron's Joseph d'Arimathie (late 12th century). The fully developed \\"Grail legend\\" of the 13th century identifies the Holy Grail with the Holy Chalice used in the Last Supper and later used to collect Christ's blood, brought to Hispania by Joseph of Arimathea. = Medieval relics = In the account of Arculf, a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon pilgrim, mention is made of a chalice venerated as the one used in the Last Supper in a chapel near Jerusalem. This is the only mention of the veneration of such a relic in the Holy Land. De locis sanctis; the chapel was located between the basilica of Golgotha and the Martyrium. The relic is described as a two-handled silver chalice with the measure of a Gaulish pint. Arculf kissed his hand and reached through an opening of the perforated lid of the reliquary to touch the chalice. He said that the people of the city flocked to it with great veneration. Two artifacts were claimed as the Holy Chalice in Western Christianity in the later medieval period. The first is the santo c√°liz, an agate cup in the Cathedral of Valencia, first mentioned in the 12th century and celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 as \\"this most famous chalice\\" (hunc praeclarum Calicem). The other is the Sacro Cationno in Genoa Cathedral, a flat dish made of green glass; the Genoan artifact recovered from Caesarea in 1101, but it was not identified as the Holy Chalice until much later, towards the end of the 13th century. Valencia Chalice The Valencia Chalice in its chapel in Valencia Cathedral One surviving Holy Chalice vessel is the Santo C√°liz, an agate cup in the Cathedral of Valencia. It is preserved in a chapel consecrated to it, where it still attracts the faithful on pilgrimage. The artifact has seemingly never been accredited with any supernatural powers. The cup is made of dark red agate which is mounted by means of a knobbed stem and two curved handles onto a base made from an inverted cup of chalcedony. The agate cup is about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in diameter and the total height, including base, is about 17 centimetres (7 inches) high. The lower part has Arabic inscriptions. It was most likely produced in a Palestinian or Egyptian workshop between the 4th century BC and the 1st century AD.Antonio Beltr√°n (1960) Report in the Denver Catholic Register \\"Spanish academic revives speculation about authenticity of the Holy Grail\\" , October 1999 It is kept together with an inventory list on vellum, said to date from AD 262, that accompanied a lost letter which detailed state- sponsored Roman persecution of Christians that forced the church to split up its treasury and hide it with members, specifically the deacon Saint Lawrence. The physical properties of the Holy Chalice are described and it is stated the vessel was used to celebrate Mass by the early Popes succeeding Saint Peter. The first explicit inventory reference to the present Chalice of Valencia is found in an inventory of the treasury of the monastery of San Juan de la Pe√±a drawn up by Don Carreras Ram√≠rez, Canon of Zaragoza, on the 14th of December 1134. The Chalice is described as the vessel in which \\"Christ Our Lord consecrated his blood\\" (En un arca de marfil est√° el C√°liz en que Cristo N. Se√±or consagr√≥ su sangre, el cual envi√≥ S. Lorenzo a su patria, Huesca). Reference to the chalice is made in 1399, when it was given by the monastery of San Juan de la Pe√±a to king Martin I of Aragon in exchange for a gold cup. Pope John Paul II celebrated mass with the Holy Chalice in Valencia in November 1982. In July 2006, at the closing Mass of the 5th World Meeting of Families in Valencia, Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated with the Holy Chalice, on this occasion saying \\"this most famous chalice\\" (hunc praeclarum Calicem), words in the Roman Canon said to have been used for the first popes until the 4th century in Rome. Bennett (2004) argues for the chalice's authenticity, tracing its history via Saint Peter's journey to Rome, Pope Sixtus II, Saint Lawrence, and finally to the Monastery of San Juan de la Pe√±a whence it was acquired by King Martin I of Aragon in 1399. Bennett presents as historical evidence a 17th-century Spanish text entitled Life and Martyrdom of the Glorious Spaniard St. Laurence from a monastery in Valencia, which is supposed to be a translation of a 6th-century Latin Vita of Saint Laurence, written by Donato, an Augustinian monk who founded a monastery in the area of Valencia, which contains circumstantial details of the life and details surrounding the transfer of the Chalice to Spain.Bennett, Janice, Saint Laurence and the Holy Grail (self-published through the Catholic Ignatius Press), 2004. Genoa Chalice The Genoa Chalice The Sacro Catino, kept in Genoa Cathedral, is a hexagonal dish of the Roman era made of green Egyptian glass, some 9 cm high and 33 cm across. It was taken to Genoa by Guglielmo Embriaco as part of the spoils from the conquest of Caesarea in 1101. William of Tyre (10.16) describes it as a \\"vessel of the most green colour, in the shape of a serving dish\\" (vas coloris viridissimi, in modum parapsidis formatum) which the Genuese thought to be made of emerald, and accepted as their share of the spoils. William states that the Genoese were still exhibiting the bowl, insisting on its miraculous properties due to its being made of emerald, in his own day (Unde et usque hodie transeuntibus per eos magnatibus, vas idem quasi pro miraculo solent ostendere, persuadentes quod vere sit, id quod color esse indicat, smaragdus), the implication being that emerald was thought to have miraculous properties of their own in medieval lore and not that the bowl was thought of as a holy relic. The Sacro Catino would later become identified as the Holy Grail. The first explicit claim to this effect is found in the Chronicon by Jacobus de Voragine, written in the 1290s.Marica, Patrizia, Museo del Tesoro Genoa, Italy (2007), 7-12\\\\. Juliette Wood, The Holy Grail: History and Legend (2012). Pedro Tafur, who visited Genoa in 1436, reported that the Holy Grail, \\"made of a single emerald\\" is kept in Genoa Cathedral.\\"The great church is called San Lorenzo, and it is very remarkable, particularly the porch. They keep in it the Holy Grail, which is made of a single emerald and is indeed a marvellous relic,\\" Pedro Tafur, Andan√ßas e viajes. The bowl was seized and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1805, and it was damaged when it was returned to Genoa in 1816. Modern candidates Aside from the Holy Chalice of the Cathedral of Valencia, believed to be the Holy Grail since the first centuries A. D. and which has been used by popes to celebrate mass until nowadays, and from the Sacro Catino, in Genoa, a number of other artifacts of greater or lesser notability have come to be identified with the \\"Holy Grail\\" or \\"Holy Chalice\\" in recent times with the rising popularity of the Grail legend in 19th-century Romanticism.A 2014 Guardian article on the Chalice of Do√±a Urraca mentions in passing that \\"In Europe alone there are 200 supposed holy grails, the Spanish researchers admitted.\\" The Chalice of Do√±a Urraca, for example, had not traditionally been associated with the Holy Chalice, and was only proposed as such in a 2014 publication. The \\"Antioch Chalice\\", on the other hand, is an artifact discovered in Antioch in 1910 which was briefly marketed as the \\"Holy Chalice\\", but it is most likely a lamp in a style of the 6th century.Eisen, Gustavus A., The great chalice of Antioch, New York, Fahim Kouchakji, 1933.

Metropolitan Museum: Antioch Chalice =Chalice of Do√±a Urraca= A replica of the Chalice of Do√±a Urraca. The Chalice of Do√±a Urraca is an artifact kept in the Basilica of San Isidoro in Le√≥n, Spain.Historians claim Holy Grail is in church in Leon, northern Spain by Bob Fredericks (News.com.au, 1 April 2014) The connection of this artifact to the Holy Grail was made in the 2014 book Los Reyes del Grial, which develops the hypothesis that this artifact had been taken by Egyptian troops following the invasion of Jerusalem and the looting of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, then given by the Emir of Egypt to the Emir of Denia, who in the 11th century gave it to the Kings of Leon in order for them to spare his city in the Reconquista. =Antioch Chalice= Antioch Chalice, first half of the 6th century, Metropolitan Museum of Art The Nanteos cup fragment The silver-gilt object originally identified as an early Christian chalice is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It was apparently made at Antioch in the early 6th century and is of double-cup construction, with an outer shell of cast-metal open work enclosing a plain silver inner cup. When it was first recovered in Antioch in 1910, it was touted as the Holy Chalice, an identification the Metropolitan Museum characterizes as \\"ambitious\\". It is no longer identified as a chalice, having been identified by experts at Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, believed to be a standing lamp, of a style of the 6th century.Metropolitan Museum =Nanteos Cup= The Nanteos Cup is a medieval wood mazer bowl, held for many years at Nanteos Mansion, Rhydyfelin, near Aberystwyth in Wales. It is recorded as having been attributed miraculous powers of healing in the late 19th century, and tradition apparently held it had been made from a piece of the True Cross at the time, but it came to be identified as the Holy Chalice in the early 20th century.

The Queen's Scout Award is the highest youth award achievable in the Scouting movement in the Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, Canada (Queen's Venturer Award), Australia, and New Zealand, where Scouts operate under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II. Whether the award recipient is a Queen's or King's Scout depends on who is the current Monarch of the Commonwealth realms. Initially the award required demonstrated proficiency in standardised Scoutcraft and skills useful for service to others and the nation. The current requirements are different in each country and now focus on personal development and typically involve achieving challenges from several areas such as community involvement, adventurous activities, personal growth and leadership development. In 1909, King Edward VII approved Robert Baden-Powell's request that boys who passed special tests for efficiency be ranked as \\"King's Scouts\\". A badge with a crown signified the award as a \\"King's Scout\\". After the establishment of the Senior Scout section in 1946, only Senior Scouts (or Boy Scouts over 15) could become King's Scouts. After the succession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, the award was renamed \\"Queen's Scout\\" in 1953. In the 1920s, there briefly existed a \\"King's Sea Scout\\" award for the Sea Scout branch alongside the King's Scout award. Badges for both could be earned by a Sea Scout. Since 1947, individuals who achieve the King's Scout or Queen's Scout award receive a certificate with a facsimile signature of the Queen.http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs145007.pdf The award emblem normally consists of a stylised St Edward's Crown. United Kingdom The current badge of the UK Queen's Scout Award, as worn on the uniform of award recipients An earlier badge of the UK Queen's Scout Award worn prior to 2003 The Queen's Scout Award in the United Kingdom is the ultimate goal of a progressive award scheme and is achieved by completing the following requirements through The Scout Association: * Be a member of Explorer Scouts or the Scout Network or both for at least 18 months. * Complete 18 nights away as an Explorer Scout or member of the Scout Network, of which 12 must be camping. * Complete six activities from a list of International, Environment and Values activities, two from each topic area. ** Holders of the Chief Scout's Platinum Award only need to complete four activities from the list, and holders of the Chief Scout's Diamond Award only need to complete two. The activities should be different from those completed as part of the other awards. * Hold the Gold Duke of Edinburgh's Award, or complete the five Queen's Scout Award Challenges, which are: ** Take up a Skill for 6 or 12 months, and show progress and lasting interest. ** Take up a Physical Activity for 6 or 12 months. ** Provide Service to an individual or the community for 12 months. ** Plan, complete and review a four-day and three night expedition in open or adventurous country by foot, cycle, horse, canoe, kayak, boat or dinghy. ** Complete a five-day and four night residential project in an unfamiliar environment with people who are not known. * Following completion of the first four elements of the Award, make a presentation, to a suitable audience, of your achievements so far in working towards the Queen's Scout Award. All Members should complete twelve months of either the Physical Activity or the Skill. Explorer Scouts and members of the Scout Network who are not holders of the Duke of Edinburgh's Silver Award or the Chief Scout's Diamond Award must complete an extra six months in either the Service or the longer of the Skills or Physical Recreation Challenge. Queen's Scouts are entitled to attend one Queen's Scout Parade held at Windsor Castle each year held on the Sunday closest to St George's Day; this is the only time when Scouts officially march.

Its aim is to widen the interests and knowledge of Venturer Scouts. Its rationale is based on the aim and methods of Scouting allowing fun, variety, personal choice and to assist in planning for a balanced program. It is a system designed to be challenging and encouraging for people over a wide range of activities. The Venturing Skills Award requires the participation of the Venturer Scout in a number of activities which will enhance their participation in the unit activities. The Queen's Scout Award has four main areas, listed below. These are made up of different badges, which require different levels of approval. The four main areas are: Leadership Development, Personal Growth, Outdoor Activities' and Community Involvement. Approval may be required from the unit council, the District Venturer Council or a separate examiner. This peer review aims to maintain good standards for the award. Each area of the award may be completed to either first or second level. An adult leader who has earned the Queen's Scout Award is entitled to wear a miniature replica of the cloth badge on their uniform.

Location of the Rangipo Desert The Rangipo Desert receives of rainfall per year, but resembles a desert because of its location on the volcanic plateau adjacently east of Ruapehu, a poor soil quality and drying winds,\\"Beyond the Desert Road\\", nzgeographic.co.nz, Issue 36 (Oct-Dec 1997). Retrieved 28 January 2013. and also due to the mass sterilisation of seeds during a series of violent eruptions, particularly ignimbrite flows about 20,000 years ago. The vegetation is low and sparse, consisting of mainly tussock and snow grasses. The headwaters of many small streams, which later turn into large rivers, gouge deep serrated valleys through the unconsolidated ash and pumice-rich earth. The climate here is harsh and alpine, with close to 270 ground frosts per year in comparison with less than 30 in the coastal regions of Hawke's Bay, to the east. Heavy snowfalls - rarely seen in the rest of the island - are also a common occurrence in winter. Trampers and climbers in the area should be mindful of the extreme chill effect of the cold south wind which can produce wind chill factors lowering the temperature below 0¬∞c (32¬∞F) for days on end. Much of the desert lies at an altitude of over , and a considerable proportion of it is over above sea level. Typical Rangipo scenery, looking west from the Desert Road The region is largely uninhabited, possibly due to the unproductive nature of the extreme winter climate. The town of Waiouru, with its army camp, lies to the south and much of the southern part of the desert is used for training purposes. To the north of the desert lies the Rangipo prison farm. Many of the North Island's largest rivers have their headwaters in the area, particularly around the slopes of Mount Ruapehu, the North Island's highest mountain. These include the Waikato and Whangaehu Rivers, as well as major tributaries of the Rangitikei and Whanganui Rivers. The desert is bisected by only one sealed road, a section of State Highway 1 known as the Desert Road. The road is closed for short periods most winters with barriers arms due to severe snow storms and icy road conditions. Turangi emergency services monitor the northern part of the Desert Road and the NZDF Military Police at Waiouru is responsible for the southern end. The Lord of the Rings films were shot in New Zealand, and the Black Gate of Mordor scenes were shot in the Rangipo Desert in 2000.

Polanski's first feature film, and his only in Polish, it features three characters in a story of rivalry and sexual tension. Knife in the Water has garnered acclaim from film critics since its release, and is one of Polanski's best-reviewed works. Plot Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to a lake to go sailing when they come upon a young man (Zygmunt Malanowicz) hitchhiking in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting him, Andrzej invites the young man along. When they arrive at the lake, instead of leaving the young man behind, Andrzej invites him to go sailing with them. The young man accepts the offer, and, not knowing much about sailing, must learn many hard lessons from Andrzej. Meanwhile, tension gradually builds between Andrzej and the hitchhiker as they vie for the attentions of Krystyna. The title refers to the major turning point in the film when Andrzej taunts the young man with the latter's treasured pocket knife, which is accidentally lost overboard. A fight ensues between Andrzej and the hitchhiker and the latter falls into the water. Andrzej and his wife search for him, but cannot find him and assume that he has drowned, since earlier he said that he could not swim. Andrzej and his wife quarrel about what to do, and Andrzej swims to shore to fetch the police. When the young man realizes that Andrzej has gone he comes out from hiding behind a buoy on the lake and swims to the yacht. There he sees Krystyna naked drying off. He boards the yacht and Krystyna tells him he is as bad as Andrzej but sexual attraction wins out and they have sex, off screen. Krystyna sails back to the dock, the man jumps off and goes on his way before Andrzej appears and takes charge again. He wants to go to the police to report the young man missing. Krystyna tells him that the young man returned and she was unfaithful. Andrzej does not know what to believe and at the road junction, where they would turn one way to return home and another to go to the police station, the car does not move. Cast * Leon Niemczyk as Andrzej * Jolanta Umecka as Krystyna * Zygmunt Malanowicz as Young Boy Production Knife in the Water was shot by Roman Polanski in 1961 using only three actors. It marked Polanski's debut as a feature-length director. Two of the actors (Jolanta Umecka, who plays Krystyna and Zygmunt Malanowicz, who plays the young man) had virtually no previous professional acting experience. Krzysztof Komeda composed the film's music and the featured saxophonist was Bernt Rosengren. Being filmed on the water (in the Polish Lake District Masuria), and largely within the confines of a sailboat and life raft, the film was technically difficult. While the sailboat was large enough for the three actors, it was quite cramped for the film crew, who often had to hang over the side of the boat with safety harnesses in order to shoot. Critical reception Knife in the Water was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1963 Academy Awards, the first Polish motion picture to receive this kind of recognition. Time used a still from the film, with Umecka and Malanowicz on the verge of a kiss, as the cover of an issue featuring international cinema. The film has been included in lists of the best debut feature films and was ranked number 61 in Empire magazine's \\"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\\" in 2010. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% approval rating based on 33 reviews, with an average score of 8.29/10. In the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Knife in the Water was ranked as the fourth greatest Polish film of all time. Home video Knife in the Water was released on VHS in 1996, and on DVD in 2003 by The Criterion Collection. In other media Knife in the Water was the basis for a low budget 2001 American film Kaaterskill Falls, set in the Catskill Mountains. Pola≈Ñski himself had an offer to make an English- language, colour remake, with a Hollywood cast (including Henry Fonda), but he refused, saying he did not want to do a remake of a movie that was already good.

It is the only film to be written and directed by the Chiodo Brothers and they also did the practical effects and makeup for the film. The film is about a clan of evil aliens from an unknown region, who all resemble circus clowns. They arrive on Earth and invade a small town in order to capture, kill, and harvest the human inhabitants to use as sustenance. Killer Klowns from Outer Space was filmed in Watsonville, California, and at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The film utilizes practical effects, including rubber suits. The score was composed by John Massari. The film received generally positive reviews and has been considered a cult classic. A sequel has been in development hell since the original film's release, with Stephen Chiodo having stated that he hopes to produce a series of films with a total of four installments, or a television series based on the film. The SyFy channel announced on October 22, 2018, that it was in talks to purchase the rights to the film in order to produce a sequel.https://bloody- disgusting.com/movie/3528600/syfy-make-killer-klowns-outer-space-critters- films-exclusive/ Plot Just outside the town of Crescent Cove, Mike Tobacco and his girlfriend Debbie Stone are parked with other couples at the local lovers' lane when they spot a strange glowing object falling to Earth. Nearby, farmer Gene Green also spies the object, and believing it to be Halley's Comet, he ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He instead stumbles upon a large circus tentlike structure, and he and his dog are captured by mysterious clownish aliens, the \\"Klowns\\". Shortly thereafter, Mike and Debbie arrive to investigate for themselves. Entering the structure, they discover a complex interior with elevators and various bizarre rooms. They soon find a gelatinized Green encased in a cotton candy-like cocoon and are spotted by a klown, who shoots popcorn at them from a large gun. The couple flees, pursued by the klown and another one who uses a living balloon dog to chase after them. Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie travel to the police station to report the incident to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson, and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney. The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then travel to the lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks, such as putting on a puppet show, pretending to deliver a pizza, and ransacking a drugstore, all of which result in the deaths of several onlookers. Mike and Dave witness one of the klowns using shadow puppets to shrink a crowd of people into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack of popcorn, revealed to be sentient creatures that eagerly gobble up their human prey. Back at the police station, Mooney is inundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now-escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode. Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up with his friends Rich and Paul, the Terenzi brothers, and using the PA speaker on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to her clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attacks her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrives and traps her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink gelatinized townspeople blood, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps. When they emerge, the trio finds themselves under a massive circus tent and surrounded by klowns. The Terenzis arrive in their ice cream truck and use the PA to distract the klowns. A gargantuan klown marionette, Jojo the Klownzilla, descends from the ceiling, breaks free from its strings, and attacks the group. After Jojo destroys the ice cream truck, apparently killing the Terenzis, Dave creates a distraction, and Mike and Debbie are able to escape the structure. The tent begins to spin and rises into the air, revealing it to be a massive spaceship. Back inside, Jojo grabs hold of Dave, who removes his police badge and uses it to destroy the klown's nose. Jojo explodes, destroying the entire ship along with him. Debbie and Mike briefly mourn the loss of their friends, until a klown car suddenly drops out of the sky and Dave emerges along with the Terenzi brothers, who survived the ice cream truck's explosion by hiding in the truck's freezer. As the group watches the fireworks created by the exploding ship, pies fall from the sky and hit them in their faces.

Siegel as Rich Terenzi * Peter Licassi as Paul Terenzi * Royal Dano as Farmer Gene Green * Charles Chiodo as Jojo the Klownzilla * Christopher Titus as Bob McReed * Claire Bartle as Little Girl Production The popcorn gun was the most expensive prop used in the film. The film's original title was simply Killer Klowns, but the filmmakers added the words \\"from Outer Space\\" to prevent audiences from assuming the film was a slasher movie. Filming took place in the city of Watsonville and at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The film was Christopher Titus' first role in a motion picture. The popcorn gun used by the clowns in the film, which included a compressor that would allow the weapon to actually propel popcorn, was the most expensive prop made for the production, costing $7,000 to create and taking six weeks to build. The legs of the clowns' balloon animal dog were coated in latex by the film's special effects department in order to keep the balloon from popping on the pine needles which covered the ground. While the Chiodo Brothers were well- known as special effects artists, much of the special effects work was carried out by other artists, allowing the brothers to focus more on their production duties. However, the brothers did personally construct the miniature set for the \\"Klownzilla\\" sequence. Most of the vehicles used in the film were rented and therefore were not allowed to be damaged. Two cars were accidentally damaged; one was driven off a bridge, although it was only intended to roll a short distance, and the Jeep filled with webbing needed $3,000 of repairs after solvent in the webbing damaged the interior. The Chiodo Brothers wanted to cast comedian Soupy Sales as the security guard killed by the clowns' acidic pies, as he was known for receiving pies in the face on his children's television show Lunch with Soupy Sales. However, the executive producers did not want to allocate funds to pay for Sales' plane ticket to the production, as they felt that audiences would not know who Sales was. Jojo the Klownzilla, the colossal klown who appears at the end of the film, was originally intended to be created using stop-motion animation, but was instead portrayed by Charles Chiodo in a rubber suit. In the film's original finale, Deputy Dave dies in the explosion of the clowns' ship, but this was changed after audiences in test screenings desired a more upbeat ending. Soundtrack The film's score was composed by John Massari. The title song \\"Killer Klowns\\" was written and performed by the American punk rock band the Dickies and was released on their album Killer Klowns from Outer Space in 1988. A limited- edition complete soundtrack was released in 2006 through Percepto Records and features twenty-six tracks of the score, the title song \\"Killer Klowns\\", and four bonus tracks at a running time just over sixty-nine minutes.Killer Klowns from Outer Space soundtrack info at Screen Archives Release Killer Klowns from Outer Space was released in the United States on May 27, 1988. The film was released on VHS by Fox Home Entertainment on July 17, 2001, and on VHS and DVD as part of MGM Home Entertainment's \\"Midnite Movies\\" line of home media releases on August 28, 2001. MGM released the film on Blu-ray on September 11, 2012. On May 25, 2013, the film received a 35 mm screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Vintage Park in Houston, Texas, as well as a 35 mm screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Yonkers, New York on June 20, 2014. On April 9, 2018, Arrow Films released their special edition Blu-Ray of Killer Klowns From Outer Space. This release was newly restored, with interviews, documentary featurettes, Klown auditions, bloopers, deleted scenes, a double-sided poster that features the original theatrical poster, as well as art by Sara Deck, and more. Critical reception The film has been considered a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 75%, based on 24 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Spaces title promises darkly goofy fun ‚Äì and more often than not, the movie delivers.\\" Leonard Klady of The Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination\\". Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB (\\"Strictly tenth-rate.\\"), but gave the movie a second look after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. In his second review, Maltin wrote \\"Routinely plotted, but vividly designed, with cheeky humor ... plays its premise to the hilt, all 'circus' bases touched\\". Charles Bramesco of The A.V. Club recommended the film, writing that \\"The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity. It's hard not to respect\\", and noted the film's \\"enduring appeal\\". Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances \\"a little rough\\", and wrote \\"If Killer Klowns isn't especially scary, it's only kind of funny but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif\\". Dread Central gave the film three out of a possible five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film \\"is the KING of 80's B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads\\". John Gugie of HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of 3/5, calling it \\"a hit or miss for horror and sci-fi fans\\". Author Matthew Chojnacki recommended the film in his book Alternative Movie Posters: Film Art From the Underground. Jim Craddock, in his book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, gave the film two-and-a-half out of four bones, calling the film a \\"Visually striking, campy but slick horror flick that'll make you think twice about your next visit to the big top\\". Director Brian Herzlinger considers Killer Klowns from Outer Space to be \\"his favorite cult film\\". FilmJerk publisher Edward Havens announced in September 2020 that he will be devoting an episode of his FilmJerk podcast to the movie, including a remembrance from one of the actors who played a Killer Klown during location shooting in Santa Cruz. Legacy and cancelled sequel Two of the masks that were used to create the clowns in the film were re-purposed and used to portray trolls in the 1991 film Ernest Scared Stupid. In 2005, SOTA Toys announced they would produce Killer Klown figurines as part of their Now Playing film action figures line. One figure was produced in 2006. After SOTA stopped producing the toys, Amok Time took over. In 2017 Amok Time announced they no longer have the licence to release more Killer Klown figures. The Chiodo Brothers plan on creating a sequel to the film, with the initial release date being scheduled for 2012, though it has since been postponed. In 2012, Grant Cramer, who starred in the original film, revealed that his character would make a return as a town drunk whom nobody believes. His character would serve as a mentor to young street performers who must fight the Killer Klowns when they return. He described his character as \\"somewhere between the energy of Kris Kristofferson's character in Blade and Christopher Lloyd's character in Back to the Future\\". Like the original film, Stephen Chiodo is set to be the director and Charles Chiodo is set to produce. With production to take place over 30 years after the release of the original film, the timeframe between films will be credited as the longest gap in the release of films in a horror comedy film series. Stephen Chiodo stated in March 2016 that: > Right now, we are currently pursuing a long arch series for cable. We > wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We > came up with a 'requel' ‚Äì it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing > this for a while.

The proposed title for the first sequel to the original film is Return of the Killer Klowns from Outer Space in 3D.Killer Klowns from Outer Space's sequel ‚Äì Killer Klowns from Outer Space A television series based on the original film is also rumored to be produced. John Massari, who composed the synthesizer- filled score for the original film, re-recorded the score with a full orchestra at Warner Brothers Studios in 2016. The Killer Klowns from Outer Space were featured as a scare zone at the Universal Orlando annual Halloween Horror Nights event for its 28th year. Most of the clowns, the Terenzi brothers, and their ice cream truck are incorporated into the zone.https://orlandoinformer.com/blog/chucky-killer-klowns-from-outer-space- halloween-horror-nights-2018/ On October 22, 2018, it was announced that SYFY was in talks to acquire the rights to Killer Klowns from Outer Space and the Critters franchise in order to produce new sequels to both properties. On July 25, 2019, it was announced that Killer Klowns from Outer Space would return to the Universal Orlando annual Halloween Horror Nights event for a second consecutive year, and would also appear at Universal Studios Hollywood. This time, the characters would feature in a Haunted House attraction rather than the Scare Zone format in which they appeared in 2018 in Orlando.https://blog.universalorlando.com/whats-new/killer-klowns-at-hhn-2019/ Later in August, it was revealed exclusive merchandise of Killer Klowns from Outer Space would be sold during the Halloween Horror Nights, along with other properties. In August 2019, after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, it was revealed that Fox intended on developing the sequel to Killer Klowns from Outer Space, but Disney had cancelled it along with over 200 other projects. As previously stated, the sequel was going to be titled The Return of the Killer Klowns from Outer Space in 3-D.

Education and early life Wilkinson was born at Springside, Todmorden, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father, Henry Wilkinson,daughter, pernille wilkinson was a master house painter and decorator; his mother, Ruth, worked in a local cotton mill. One of his uncles, an organist and choirmaster, had married into a family that owned a small chemical company making Epsom and Glauber's salts for the pharmaceutical industry; this is where he first developed an interest in chemistry. He was educated at the local council primary school and, after winning a County Scholarship in 1932, went to Todmorden Grammar School. His physics teacher there, Luke Sutcliffe, had also taught Sir John Cockcroft, who received a Nobel Prize for \\"splitting the atom\\". In 1939 he obtained a Royal Scholarship for study at Imperial College London, from where he graduated in 1941, with his PhD awarded in 1946 entitled \\"Some physico-chemical observations of hydrolysis in the homogeneous vapour phase\\".http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/Web_Genealogy/Info/wilkinsong.pdf Wilkinson's catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 Career and research In 1942 Professor Friedrich Paneth was recruiting young chemists for the nuclear energy project. Wilkinson joined and was sent out to Canada, where he stayed in Montreal and later Chalk River Laboratories until he could leave in 1946. For the next four years he worked with Professor Glenn T. Seaborg at University of California, Berkeley, mostly on nuclear taxonomy. He then became a Research Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began to return to his first interest as a student ‚Äì transition metal complexes of ligands such as carbon monoxide and olefins. He was at Harvard University from September 1951 until he returned to England in December 1955, with a sabbatical break of nine months in Copenhagen. At Harvard, he still did some nuclear work on excitation functions for protons in cobalt, but had already begun to work on olefin complexes. In June 1955 he was appointed to the chair of Inorganic Chemistry at Imperial College London, and from then on worked almost entirely on the complexes of transition metals. Structure of ferrocene Fe(C5H5)2 Wilkinson is well known for his popularisation of the use of Wilkinson's catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 in catalytic hydrogenation, and for the discovery of the structure of ferrocene. Wilkinson's catalyst is used industrially in the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes. He supervised PhD students and postdoctoral researchers including John A. Osborn, Alan Davison and Malcolm Green. Awards and honours Wilkinson received many awards, including the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1973Wilkinson's Nobel Foundation biography for his work on \\"organometallic compounds\\" (with Ernst Otto Fischer). He is also well known for writing, with his former doctoral student F. Albert Cotton, \\"Advanced Inorganic Chemistry\\", often referred to simply as \\"Cotton and Wilkinson\\", one of the standard inorganic chemistry textbooks. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965. In 1980 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Bath. Imperial College London named a new hall of residence after him, which opened in October 2009.

It was written by Ian Bailey and Gary Chalk who also did the illustrations. The game was designed and published by two ex-Games Workshop (GW) employees who disagreed with the much more commercial direction that company was taking. It was supposed to rival the Warhammer Fantasy Battle game that GW published. Fantasy Warlord featured some unusual game mechanics such as simultaneous movement, an original command and control system (units are organised into brigades commanded by characters) and fog of war rules. It also featured balanced magic and troop choice systems. However the balance within the combat system reduced the opportunity to generate dramatic victories. Much like Warhammer, the game had its own fantasy world, called Vortimax, in which the battles were imagined to take place. There was also a related range of Fantasy Warlord miniatures cast by Alternative Armies, and a magazine called Red Giant. The game went out of print 18 months after first publication. Some supplements were expected, such as Armies of Vortimax (expected in 1992)The Games Quarterly Catalog #1, November 1991 Besieged or Fantasy Warlord Command Pack, but none were released. Only two issues of Red Giant magazine were released. Folio Works Ltd. was dissolved on 11 February 1993.WebCHeck Companies House http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk The Rulebook =Content= Fantasy Warlord is a single softback book of 192-pages mostly printed in black and white with a Gary Chalk front cover. The book is divided in two parts: the first one covers the game's rules and the second part describes the fantasy world of Vortimax, where the battles take place. 16 pull-out soft cards are attached at the back of the book, one for each racial type plus templates and orders counters. The book contains many illustrations from Gary Chalk and photographs that illustrate troop's formations, movements, etc. Determining the abilities of troop is easy: you choose their morale class (A = veterans, B = trained or C = militia) weapons and armour from 11 different races (Human, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs...). Monsters (flying or not), pack animals and daemons were also available. More races were expected in the supplement Armies of Vortimax. Generation of heroes or wizards is more time consuming. There are six types of characters: Warrior Heroes, Priests, Warrior Priests, Magic-users, Thieves and Discipline Masters. Skills and attributes are determined by their level of experience: they could be Minor, Major or Master. Nearly sixty magic artifacts or weapons and more than 100 spells are available to equip characters. Each turn is divided into 11 phases. Unlike Warhammer Fantasy Battle, movements are made simultaneously, the players using counters to issue orders. Units are organised into brigades which are commanded by characters. As the game progresses, characters gradually lose control of their brigades, as they would do in real battlefield. The combat system does not rely solely on random results and copious dice rolling, but rather emphasises strategy and tactics, balanced races, and unit control in order to determine the outcome of a battle. The book was sold $29.99 in the United States and ¬£13,95 in Great Britain. Book One: The Rules The first part of the rulebook is divided into 12 chapters: * Introduction * Creating an army * Army organisation * Into battle * Orders * Movement * Battlefield terrain * Missile fire * Combat * Morale * Magic * Tactical hints & terrain generation Book Two: The World of Vortimax The second part of the rulebook offers a background for Fantasy Warlord and contains descriptions of geography, history and realms of Vortimax and races that could be played. =Supplements= At least 3 supplements were anticipated, but none of them were printed. * Armies of Vortimax, expected in 1992 and already announced in The Games Quarterly Catalog 1991 Christmas Edition * Besieged, adding rules for war machines and siege * Fantasy Warlord Command Pack High Command A science-fiction skirmish game probably based on Fantasy Warlord's system, High Command, was expected in 1992 but never released. A small miniatures range was available alongside that of Fantasy Warlord. Those science-fiction figures are currently available from SHQ miniatures (Space Ratten, Saurian Militia and Human Earth Guard) Critical Reaction Fantasy Warlord was not well received by critics, citing problems ranging from the racial-types not affecting melee, movement being overly complicated, and the cover artwork being \\"garish\\".Games Master International, NO. 9, April 1991, page 70. According to Gary Chalk in a recent interview,Gary Chalk Interview, October 2011 - http://doggysdoings.blogspot.com/2011/10/gary-chalk- interview.html producing Fantasy Warlord cost him a lot of money and stress. Ian Bailey and he misjudged the market dominated by Games Workshop's products and gamers did not well receive a game that used pseudo-military tactics to determine the outcome of fantasy battles. In addition to this, the launch coincided with the release of Grenadier's Fantasy Warriors wargame. Red Giant magazine Red Giant was a fantasy magazine published by Folio Works Ltd. which covered historical or fantasy wargamers, role-players, computer games, play by mail, or live role-playing. Unlike White Dwarf (WD) published by its competitor Games Workshop, Red Giant was not intend to support exclusively Fantasy Warlord or High Command games, but was a response to what Games Workshop and other editors did to the business, according to the company.Red Giant Magazine, volume one, number one, editorial by Tom Sage Just like White Dwarf did in early ages of its existence, Red Giant made room for many games, such as AD&D;, Runequest, Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Role- play and many others. Actually, Red Giant was a sarcastic title, the exact opposite of White Dwarf, run by Games Workshop. In his first editorial, Tom Sage described WD as \\"[one of the] magazines exclusive to their product range.\\" The magazine went out of print after only two issues. =Red Giant volume 1 number 1= In this issue... # Words of Wisdom - Editorial by Tom Sage # Brymstone - A role-playing city-setting imagined by Robert Dale with David Grice, plus stats for AD&D; and Runequest # Mummerset Revisited - Background for Call of Cthulhu by Marcus L.

Some of them have been sculpted by Bob Olley (it is confirmed that FW 8 Dwarfs, FW 5 Urucks and FW 9 Ogres have been designed by him). Miniatures were sold in two kind of packages: a traditional blister carding and a less common shrink- wrap packing which offer a better view and protection of the miniatures during shipping. They were distributed in the United States and the United Kingdom. The range uses two different codification: one for the characters (heroes and wizards) and troops in \\"classic\\" blister packs which consists of five digit and a second kind of code for the troops, shields and weapons prefixed with FW letters and followed by two digit, the first one designing the range (for instance: 8 for dwarfs). Characters were sold individually with a weapon and a shield when appropriate. Troops were sold by two to five miniatures per blister, shields and weapons were cast separately to let the player chooses his troop's weapons easily. Single miniature blisters were sold ¬£0.80 (¬£1.50 for bigger miniatures such as Ogre Hero), Multipacks ¬£2.95 and Weapon packs ¬£1.50. Folio Works also sold different sort of pre-cut bases and multi-bases as announced in the rulebook page 8, but there is no evidence those bases have ever been released. When Folio Works went out of business around 1992, the rights to the miniatures were acquired by Mayhem Miniatures, and later by Kennington Miniatures and then later by \\"SHQ\\" and some of the miniatures are still available to purchase onlineBob Olley section of Collecting Citadel Miniatures Wiki http://www.collecting- miniatures.com/olley/index.php/Folio_Works (mainly Ogres and Urucks, also scenery packs). Alternative Armies still has the original moulds and some of the miniatures, if not all from the classic blisters range, can be cast on demand.

It had a certain amount of influence in the trade union movement, but never won seats in Parliament. The Socialist Unity Party was founded in 1966 as a splinter group of the Communist Party. The Communist Party had been bitterly divided by the Sino-Soviet Split, a dispute between the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and China under Mao Zedong. The party eventually decided to take China's side. Shortly afterwards, a number of the more prominent supporters of the Soviet position, such as Ken Douglas, George Jackson and Bill Andersen, established the Socialist Unity Party. The Socialist Unity Party retained ideological and political links to the Soviet Union for most of its existence.https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/communism The Socialist Unity Party's association with the Soviet government drew considerable criticism from mainstream politicians. In 1980, the Soviet ambassador to New Zealand, Vsevolod Sofinsky, was expelled after allegedly giving $10,000 to a member of the Socialist Unity Party. In 1987, another Soviet diplomat, Sergei Budnik, was ordered to leave the country by Prime Minister David Lange for his alleged involvement with the party.The untold story behind New Zealand's ANZUS breakdown. - Free Online Library At the same time, the Socialist Unity Party was strongly condemned by other communist groups, which accused it of not following \\"true\\" communism and of collaborating with capitalists.

The Socialist Unity Party, unlike some of the more radical groups, participated in New Zealand elections, and was not wholly antagonistic to mainstream parties -- it was prepared, for example, to occasionally support the Labour Party as \\"the lesser of two evils\\".

Kosar played for the Cleveland Browns from 1985 to 1993 and then finished his career with the Dallas Cowboys and the Miami Dolphins. With the Cowboys, he won Super Bowl XXVIII, beating the Buffalo Bills, on January 30, 1994. Early life and high school career Of Hungarian descent, Kosar was born in Youngstown, Ohio, and raised in suburban Boardman Township. He attended Boardman High School, where he earned Parade magazine All-American honors as a senior for the 1981 season. He also gained recognition as a baseball player, especially for his pitching skills. College career Kosar chose to play college football at the University of Miami, which ran a passing-oriented offense and was beginning to emerge as one of the top football programs in the nation. After being redshirted in 1982, Kosar started all 12 games as a freshman in 1983. He completed 61.5 percent of his passes for 2,328 yards and 15 touchdowns, leading the Hurricanes to an 11‚Äì1 regular season and a berth in the Orange Bowl against top-ranked Nebraska, which had won 22 consecutive games. In the game, Kosar passed for 300 yards and two touchdowns, and the Hurricanes topped the Cornhuskers 31‚Äì30 for Miami's first national championship. Kosar earned Orange Bowl MVP honors for his performance.Cleveland Browns 1992 Media Guide In 1984, he set Hurricane season records with 3,642 yards and 25 touchdowns, was a second-team All-American and finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. Kosar's career completion percentage of 62.3 percent is still a Hurricanes record. He threw for 447 yards and two touchdowns, completing 25 of 38 attempts, in the Hurricanes' November 23, 1984, 47‚Äì45 loss to Doug Flutie's Boston College team when Flutie threw his famous \\"Hail Flutie\\" pass.ESPN College Football Encyclopedia, ESPN Books, (2005), . p. 160 Earlier in the same year, Kosar watched as replacement quarterback Frank Reich of the University of Maryland launched what was then the biggest comeback in college football history. Reich led the Maryland Terrapins back from a first-half deficit of 31‚Äì0 and won a 42‚Äì40 victory. In his final college game, the 1985 Fiesta Bowl against UCLA in which the Hurricanes lost 39-37, Kosar completed 31 of 44 passes for 294 yards, two touchdown passes and one interception. He graduated from college with a double major in finance and economics. He took 18 credit hours during the spring of 1985 and an additional six during the summer to graduate early.1992 cleveland browns media guide Kosar was interviewed about his time at the University of Miami for the documentary The U, which premiered December 12, 2009, on ESPN. NFL draft controversy Under National Football League (NFL) rules at the time, only seniors and graduates could be drafted. Kosar, who was scheduled to graduate over the summer from the University of Miami's business school with a double major in finance and economics, had two years of college eligibility remaining. In 1985 underclassmen had until April 15 to notify the league about their eligibility for the April 30 regular draft. In January 1985, a Florida television report stated that Kosar had decided to forgo his two years of eligibility and declare for the NFL Draft. Kosar denied the report at the time, but added that he would keep his options open. At a March 15 news conference, Kosar announced that he would make himself available for the 1985 NFL Draft and that he would like to play for the Cleveland Browns in his native Ohio. After the announcement, both NFL and United States Football League teams were interested and Kosar's agent, John Geletka, even met with the USFL's commissioner, Harry Usher to confirm the USFL's interest level. The Buffalo Bills held the first pick in the 1985 NFL Draft and signed defensive end Bruce Smith out of Virginia Tech weeks before the draft. On April 9, 1985, Mike Lynn, the general manager of the Minnesota Vikings traded two picks to the Houston Oilers to move up to the second spot in the draft in preparation of Kosar's announcement that he would enter the draft. Later on the same day, Cleveland traded their first round picks in the 1985 NFL Draft (#7) and 1986 NFL Draft, their third round pick in 1985 (#63) and their sixth round pick in 1986 to the Buffalo Bills for their first round pick in the 1986 NFL Draft. Since the Bills had the worst record in the 1984 season, they held the first pick in both the regular NFL draft and the supplemental draft in 1985. When a selection is used in the supplemental draft, that team forfeits the pick in the next regular draft which meant that the Browns could use the Bills 1986 regular draft first round pick as the first pick in the 1985 supplemental draft. On April 10, NFL spokesman Joe Browne said that if Kosar's paperwork was not received by the April 15 deadline then he would not be eligible for the regular draft on April 30. Browne added that if Kosar later decided to play in the 1985 season, then the league would hold a supplemental draft for Kosar and other eligible players. Minnesota responded by stating that when Kosar announced he would turn professional, he was, in effect, declaring his intention to enter the draft. They claimed the Browns and Kosar's agent orchestrated this scenario in order to subvert the NFL's orderly system of drafting players and claim Kosar for themselves. Mike Lynn also stated that since Kosar had hired an agent, he should have automatically lost his college eligibility and become eligible for the regular draft. The Oilers threatened to sue the NFL if Kosar was allowed to skip the regular draft in favor of the supplemental draft and Kosar's agent threatened to sue the NFL if Kosar was forced into the regular draft. Due to the controversy, on April 12, commissioner Pete Rozelle extended the April 15 eligibility deadline for Kosar alone (who had not officially filed the paperwork for draft eligibility) and called a hearing that would take place on April 16. The four teams (Buffalo, Cleveland, Houston and Minnesota) involved in the two trades presented their case at the hearing. On April 23, Rozelle announced that he would leave the decision up to Kosar, but permitted Minnesota to persuade Kosar to enter the regular draft with the condition that they could not negotiate a potential contract with him. This led to an April 25 news conference where Kosar announced that he wanted to go home to Ohio as a member of the Cleveland Browns and that he would forgo the regular NFL Draft and make himself eligible for the supplemental draft. On May 10, Kosar officially announced his intentions for the supplemental draft in a letter to the commissioner. On June 25, Kosar became officially eligible for the supplemental draft when he took his exam finals and the university notified the NFL front office that he had graduated. On July 3, 1985, the Browns selected Kosar and signed him to a five-year contract. NFL career =Cleveland Browns= Kosar chose the Browns, who were coming off a 5‚Äì11 season. The Browns intended Kosar to serve as Gary Danielson's backup in Kosar's rookie season, but Danielson injured his shoulder in the fifth week. Kosar completed half of his passes in the team's run-oriented offense that year. The team sneaked into the playoffs with an 8‚Äì8 record, losing to the Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoffs. Danielson was injured again in the 1986 preseason, and by the time he healed, Kosar had established himself as the Browns' permanent starter. In a new, passing- focused offense, Kosar threw for 3,854 yards and finished second in the league with 310 completions. The Browns took the top seed in the American Football Conference (AFC) with a 12‚Äì4 record. In the divisional playoffs against the New York Jets, Kosar threw for a then-playoff-record 489 yards (a record since eclipsed by Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII) in leading the Browns to a 23‚Äì20 comeback victory in double overtime. Only John Elway's 98-yard drive in the following week's AFC championship game kept the Browns out of the Super Bowl. Kosar's most productive year statistically was 1987. In the strike-shortened season, he completed 62 percent of his passes for 3,033 yards and 22 touchdowns and led the AFC in quarterback rating. In an AFC championship rematch against Elway's Denver Broncos, Kosar threw for 356 yards and three touchdowns in a 38‚Äì33 loss. Kosar spent most of the 1988 season sidelined with injuries but came back to throw for 3,533 yards in 1989. That year, the Browns advanced to the AFC championship for the third time in four years, losing again to the Broncos in Denver. Kosar set a record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games) having thrown three scores against both Indianapolis and Denver in 1987, and three against Buffalo in 1989. Kosar's later years in Cleveland were dampened by injuries and dwindling support around him. In 1990, Kosar threw a career-high 15 interceptions as the Browns went 3‚Äì13. The following year, he came back to throw for 3,487 yards and 18 touchdowns to only 9 interceptions. He also started the 1990 season by setting an NFL record for consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 286. In 1990 and 1991, Kosar set a league record by throwing 308 consecutive passes without an interception, which stood for almost two decades. In 1991, the Browns hired Bill Belichick as head coach. Following a 1992 season which saw Kosar miss 9 games with a broken ankle and go 2‚Äì5 in the games that he started, Belichick signed quarterback Vinny Testaverde before the 1993 season. After falling from 3‚Äì0 to 3‚Äì2, Belichick benched Kosar in favor of Testaverde. An injury to Testaverde returned Kosar to the field. After a 29‚Äì14 loss to Denver in Week 10, the Browns released Kosar.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/11/08/Browns-release- Kosar/5683752734800/ =Dallas Cowboys= After the Browns released Kosar, the Dallas Cowboys signed Kosar to a one-year, $1 million contract to fill in for an injured Troy Aikman. Kosar played in four games for the Cowboys and earned his only Super Bowl championship as a backup in Super Bowl XXVIII. Kosar entered the game in the final play and knelt down to close the victory. A week prior to the Super Bowl, Kosar relieved an injured Aikman in the second half of the NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers, completing five of nine pass attempts for 83 yards and one touchdown. =Miami Dolphins= Kosar spent the final years of his career with the Miami Dolphins as a backup to Dan Marino. He brought with him a trick play that helped the Dolphins top the Jets in a crucial game late in 1994. With the clock winding down and the Dolphins trailing by three, Marino pretended to spike the ball to stop the clock. He then threw the winning touchdown pass to Mark Ingram. Kosar finished his 12-season career with 1,994 completions in 3,365 attempts for 23,301 yards and 124 touchdowns, with 87 interceptions. He also rushed for five touchdowns. He also held the NFL record for most consecutive completed passes without an interception, until December 26, 2010, when Tom Brady broke his record. Post-retirement =Sports related= Since retiring from football after the 1996 season, Kosar has been involved in several ventures. He hosted the Nestl√©/Bernie Kosar Charity Classic at Tanglewood Country Club in Bainbridge Township, Ohio throughout the 1990s. There had been talk of Kosar taking the head coaching job at his alma mater, the University of Miami. Kosar (who currently holds a seat on University of Miami's board of regents) acknowledged that he had considered taking the job before it was ultimately offered to Randy Shannon.Kosar considering Miami coaching job , AllHeadlineNews.com.

On October 17, 2009, Kosar was hired as a consultant for the Cleveland Browns. =Business and property ventures= Following the 2008‚Äì2009 recession, Kosar and his businesses declared bankruptcy on June 19, 2009, later listing $9.2 million in assets and $18.9 million in debt. Although the initial bankruptcy filing was a Chapter 11 restructuring, the US Bankruptcy Court in Fort Lauderdale ordered the proceeding changed to a Chapter 7 liquidation on January 6, 2010. Under the restructuring Kosar's filings proposed protecting his NFL pension; it is unclear at this time if he will be able to retain his pension under the Chapter 7 proceedings.Bernard J.

The theory postulates an unbroken lineage of churches (since the days of John the Baptist, who baptized Christ) which have held beliefs similar to those of current Baptists. Groups often included in this lineage include the Montanists, Paulicians, Cathari, Waldenses, Albigenses, Lollards, and Anabaptists.  Perpetuity  Diagram representing The Trail of Blood as presented by James Milton Carroll The perpetuity view is often identified with The Trail of Blood, a pamphlet by James Milton Carroll published in 1931. Other Baptist writers who held the perpetuity view are John T. Christian, Thomas Crosby, G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray. This view was once commonly held among Baptists. Since the end of the 19th century, however, the theory has increasingly come under attack and today has been largely discredited. Nonetheless, the view continued to be the prevailing view among Baptists of the Southern United States into the latter 20th century. It is now identified primarily with Landmarkism, which is upheld by the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement, though not exclusively so. The concept finds its parallels in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican doctrine of apostolic succession and stands in contrast to the restorationist views of Latter Day Saints and the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement.  Contemporary view  Since the end of the 19th century the trend in academic Baptist historiography has been away from the successionist viewpoint to the view that modern day Baptists are an outgrowth of 17th-century English Separatism. This shift precipitated a controversy among Southern Baptists which occasioned the forced resignation of William H. Whitsitt, a professor at Southern Baptist Seminary, in 1898 from the seminary for advocating the new view, though his views continued to be taught in the seminary after his departure.

A typical rack contains 37 ISPR slots for science payloads, which are interchangeable to accommodate different components or payloads. Capabilities Each ISPR provides 1.571 m3 (55.5 ft3) of internal volume being about 2 m (79.3 in) high, 1.05 m (41.3 in) wide, and 85.9 cm (33.8 in) deep. The rack weighs 104 kg (230 lb) and can accommodate an additional 700 kg (1540 lb) of payload equipment. The rack has internal mounting provisions to allow attachment of secondary structure. The ISPRs will be outfitted with a thin center post to accommodate sub-rack-sized payloads, such as the 483 mm (19-inch rack) Spacelab Standard Interface Rack (SIR) Drawer or the Space Shuttle Middeck Locker. Utility pass-through ports are located on each side to allow cables to be run between Racks. Module attachment points are provided at the top of the rack and via pivot points at the bottom. The pivot points support installation and maintenance. Tracks on the exterior front posts allow mounting of payload equipment and laptop computers. Additional adapters on the ISPRs are provided for ground handling. Compatibility The International Standard Payload Rack are the size of a side-by-side refrigerator, and is too big to fit through the Russian probe and drogue docking system, APAS, or NDS docking systems, and therefore cannot be transferred directly from a Progress, ATV, Space Shuttle, or Orion to the ISS. In the past ISPRs were delivered in Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules, which were carried in the Space Shuttle cargo bay and berthed to CBM ports. they can only be delivered using the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle.

He was elected at the 1918 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Roscommon, but as with other Sinn F√©in candidates, he did not take seat in the British House of Commons, serving instead as a Teachta D√°la (TD) in the First D√°il. At the 1921 general election Boland was elected to the second D√°il as one of the TDs for the Mayo South‚ÄìRoscommon South. He was re-elected in 1922 as an Anti-Treaty candidate, but died two months later in the Irish Civil War. Early life Harry Boland was born at 6 Dalysmount Terrace, Phibsborough, Dublin, on 27 April 1887, the son of Irish Republican Brotherhood member James Boland and Kate Woods. He was active in GAA circles in early life, and refereed the 1914 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. He joined the IRB at the same time as his older brother Gerry in 1904, following in the footsteps of his father, uncle and probably grandfather. He was educated at the Synge Street CBS, but had a personality clash with one of the brothers so he refused to carry on his attendance at the school. He then went to De la Salle College, County Laois, as a novice. Irish nationalism Boland later joined the Irish Volunteers along with Gerry and his younger brother Ned. They took an active part in the Easter Rising of 1916. At the 1918 general election Boland was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the South Roscommon seat. In line with all the Sinn F√©in MPs elected at that election, he did not represent his constituents at Westminster, but withdrew to sit in the declared independent D√°il √âireann (the First D√°il) and was named by √âamon de Valera as special envoy to the United States, a role his uncle Jack had played 25 years previously.Kevin Boland. James Boland 1857‚Äì1895 A Nationalist of the Advanced School. Unpublished essay. He left Ireland for the United States of America along with de Valera as part of a campaign to raise awareness and support for their cause in America. Boland negotiated a loan of $20,000 from the Irish Republic to the Soviet Republic through the head of the Soviet Bureau, Ludwig Martens, using some Russian jewellery as collateral.https://issuu.com/scolairestaire/docs/vol3iss1print p. 25 These jewels were transferred to Ireland when he returned. During the Irish War of Independence, Boland operated alongside Michael Collins, who was a close friend. Civil War Boland opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty along with de Valera, and in the ensuing Irish Civil War, he sided with the Anti-Treaty IRA. In the 1922 general election he was re-elected to the D√°il representing Mayo South‚ÄìRoscommon South. Later that year Boland was shot by soldiers of the Irish Free State Army when they attempted to arrest him at the Skerries Grand Hotel. Two Free State Army officers entered his room and Boland, unarmed, was shot and mortally wounded:The Times, Mr. Harry Boland Shot, 1 August 1922 He died several days later in St. Vincent's Hospital on 1 August 1922. As he lay dying, he refused to give the name of his attacker to his sister, Kathleen.p272, James Mackay, Michael Collins: A Life; He was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. The service took place from the Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church. The hearse was followed by Cumann na mBan, Clan na Gael and the Citizen Army women's section.The Times, Blow To Irish Rebels, 5 August 1922 Legacy Boland's death affected Collins and may have spurred him towards peace negotiations with De Valera. Soon afterward, Collins was killed in an ambush at B√©al na Bl√°th, County Cork. The Skerries Grand Hotel later became a secondary school for boys, managed by the De La Salle Brothers. There is a commemorative plaque on the site explaining that Boland was killed in action there. Boland was also the referee in the 1914 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Family Boland's brother, Gerald Boland, was a prominent member of Fianna F√°il and later served as Minister for Justice. His nephew, Kevin Boland, served as a Minister until he resigned in solidarity with the two ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, who were sacked from the government in May 1970 during the Arms Crisis. Kevin Boland's resignation from Fianna F√°il and the subsequent loss of his seat marked the end of an era for the Boland political dynasty. His nephew, Harry Boland, was a basketball player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. He died on 18 December 2013, at the age of 88. He also had a sister, Kathleen, who was entrusted, with her mother, with the safekeeping of jewels received from Russian diplomats as collateral for a loan made by the provisional government to the new Russian state in April 1920. In popular culture In the 1991 TV movie The Treaty, Boland was portrayed by Malcolm Douglas. In the 1996 film Michael Collins, Boland was portrayed by Irish-American actor Aidan Quinn. The film was criticised for fictionalising both Boland's death and Collins' life.

Of the six eighteenth-century Moravian \\"villages of the Lord\\" established in Wachovia, today, the town of Bethania, North Carolina and city of Winston-Salem exist within the historic Wachovia tract. The Moravian Archives in Winston-Salem has a map of the original Wachovia tract, showing the approximate locations of the first six Moravian congregations and the approximate current boundaries of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County. History Wachovia's early settlers were mostly German-speaking people who shared a common Germanic cultural background. In 1752 Moravian Bishop August Gottlieb \\"Brother Joseph\\" Spangenberg led an expedition to locate the area where the Unitas Fratrum, or Moravian church, intended to begin the Wachovia settlements. Members of the Moravian Church in Europe purchased of land in the backcountry (middle/western area) of North Carolina, from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. They named the tract of land die Wachau after the area along the Danube River in Austria where the ancestors of Count von Zinzendorf, the Moravians' patron, had lived. \\"Die Wachau,\\" was latinized as \\"Wachovia,\\" [The land in North Carolina was purchased on behalf of the Moravians by John Henry (Johann Heinrich) Antes who had also served as agent on behalf of the Moravians in the purchase of the tract which became the city of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Johann Steinhauer, Riga, Russia \\"] The name \\"Wachovia\\" is the Latin form of the German \\"die Wachau.\\" \\"Die Wachau\\" was chosen as the name of the North Carolina Moravian tract, to honor Count Zinzendorf, Moravian patron and bishop whose family estate was located in the Wachau region northwest of Vienna, along the Danube River between the towns of Melk and Krems. Bishop Spangenberg and the surveying team in 1752 strayed into the mountains of western North Carolina, coming down through what is now Wilkes County (viz. \\"Moravian Falls\\" etc) on their way to the Three Forks of Muddy Creek. It was this mountainous landscape in the Carolina back country along the Catawba, Little, New and Yadkin Rivers that suggested the Wachau region in Lower Austria. (Records of the Moravians in North Carolina, vol. 1, pp. 25-69 ) Twelve Moravian Single Brethren traveling from Pennsylvania, most from the Christiansbrunn farm near Nazareth, arrived in Wachovia in 1753, forming Bethabara, in Hebrew meaning \\"House of Passage\\", a transitional congregational settlement founded November 17, 1753. In July 1756, during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), a wooden stockade was built around the central-most area of the Moravian settlement, and Bethabara became a place of refuge for settlers from across the region, with many refugees living near the Bethabara Mill, numbering 120 by May 1759. The first planned Moravian settlement, and oldest incorporated municipality in Wachovia is Bethania, North Carolina formed June 12, (1759), also known historically as Bethany, meaning in the Hebrew language, \\"house/place of dates and figs.\\" Bethania is the German form of Bethany. The Town of Bethania, North Carolina was incorporated 1995, following the reactivation of Bethania's 1838/1839 town charter, and was spared from being annexed into the city of Winston-Salem. Today, Bethania remains the only independent, continuously active Moravian town in the southern United States. In 2007, Historic Bethania, a visitor center and museum, opened in Bethania, providing information and historical interpretation in yet another Wachovia Moravian community. Wachovia's central administrative congregational town of Salem, which can be visited presently in Old Salem Museums and Gardens. Salem was begun in 1766 (formally organized in 1771), and was built by Moravians and friends from Bethabara and Bethania. Subsequent Moravian congregational settlements to be formed include Friedberg (1769), Friedland (1772), and Hope (1775). The congregation at Hope was the first \\"English\\" Moravian church in the area. A secular county seat was founded in 1849 in newly-drawn Forsyth County, north of Salem. Winston was the name given to the new county seat in 1852. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, maker of Winston, Salem and Camel cigarettes, was founded at Winston in 1875. The towns of Salem and Winston merged as Winston-Salem in 1913. Bethabara now lies within the city limits of Winston-Salem, and can be visited today in Historic Bethabara Park, operated by the city of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County. Over time, the Wachovia Tract was redrawn into the following counties as the backcountry of North Carolina became increasingly populated: * 1753 Rowan County. * 1771 Surry County. * 1789 Stokes County. * 1849 Forsyth County was drawn out of what had been the southern half of Stokes County. Museums Historic Bethabara Park, Historic Bethania, and Old Salem Museums and Gardens are museums which serve to transport visitors in time to what Wachovia once was. The museums each contribute to the story of Moravians in North Carolina, and preserve, interpret, and demonstrate life in Wachovia over time. Wachovia Corporation The first Wachovia Loan And Trust Company Building, located in Winston-Salem. The area is the namesake and birthplace of Wachovia Corporation, once one of the world's largest banks. The bank was pioneered by Bethanian I.G. Loesch. Salem, then Winston-Salem, was the corporate headquarters for the bank until its merger with the First Union corporation, when the headquarters was moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. Linguistic note Present day students and scholars who are not familiar with the German language frequently, albeit incorrectly, use a masculine article \\"der\\" to modify \\"Wachau\\" when the feminine article \\"die\\" should be used, as historically documented. When speaking of \\"Wachovia\\" as a place, the proper title in German is \\"die Wachau,\\" or \\"wach\\" \\"au,\\" translated as \\"meadow of the Wach,\\" When speaking of \\"Wachau\\" in a locative sense, such as \\"in the Wachau,\\" the article becomes dative and written as \\"in der Wachau.\\" Many individuals and organizations have seen the dative phrase and have irresponsibly and unknowingly dropped the preposition, leaving \\"...der Wachau,\\" which is incorrect when used as a proper noun. The feminine gender of \\"die Wachau\\" does not change, though the case might.

Schwob adopted the gender-ambiguous name Claude Cahun in 1917 and is best known for self- portraits, in which Cahun assumed a variety of personae. Cahun's work was both political and personal, and often undermined traditional concepts of static gender roles. In their autobiography, Disavowals, they explained, \\"Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me.\\" During WWII, Cahun was also active as a resistance worker and propagandist. Early life Born in Nantes in 1894, Cahun was born into a provincial but prominent intellectual Jewish family. Avant-garde writer Marcel Schwob was their uncle and Orientalist David L√©on Cahun was their great-uncle. When Cahun was four years old, their mother, Mary-Antoinette Courbebaisse, began suffering from mental illness, which ultimately led to her permanent internment at a psychiatric facility. In their mother's absence, Cahun was brought up by their grandmother, Mathilde Cahun. Cahun attended a private school (Parsons Mead School) in Surrey after experiences with anti-Semitism at their high school in Nantes. They attended the University of Paris, Sorbonne. They began making photographic self-portraits as early as 1912 (aged 18), and continued taking images of themself through the 1930s. Around 1919, they changed their name to Claude Cahun, after having previously used the names Claude Courlis (after the curlew) and Daniel Douglas (after Lord Alfred Douglas). During the early 1920s, they settled in Paris with lifelong partner and step-sibling Suzanne Malherbe, who adopted the pseudonym Marcel Moore. For the rest of their lives together, Cahun and Moore collaborated on various written works, sculptures, photomontages and collages. The two published articles and novels, notably in the periodical Mercure de France, and befriended Henri Michaux, Pierre Morhange, and Robert Desnos. Around 1922 Claude and Moore began holding artists' salons at their home. Among the regulars who would attend were artists Henri Michaux and Andr√© Breton and literary entrepreneurs Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier. Work This plaque on Cahun's house in Saint Br√©lade, Jersey, celebrates her photographic innovation Cahun's works encompassed writing, photography, and theatre. They are most remembered for their highly staged self-portraits and tableaux that incorporated the visual aesthetics of Surrealism. During the 1920s Cahun produced an astonishing number of self-portraits in various guises such as aviator, dandy, doll, body builder, vamp and vampire, angel, and Japanese puppet. Many of Cahun's portraits feature the artist looking directly at the viewer, head shaved, often revealing only head and shoulders (eliminating body from the view), and a blurring of gender indicators and behaviors which serve to undermine the patriarchal gaze.Cole, Julie, ‚ÄòClaude Cahun, Marcel Moore and the Collaborative Construction of a Lesbian Subjectivity‚Äô, in Norma Broude and Mary D. Garrard (eds.), Reclaiming Female Agency: Feminist Art History after Postmodernism (California: University of California Press, 2005), 343‚Äì60. Scholar Miranda Welby-Everard has written about the importance of theatre, performance, and costume that underlies Cahun's work, suggesting how this may have informed the artist's varying gender presentations. Cahun's published writings include \\"Heroines,\\" (1925) a series of monologues based upon female fairy tale characters intertwined with witty comparisons to the contemporary image of women; Aveux non avenus, (Carrefour, 1930) a book of essays and recorded dreams illustrated with photomontages; and several essays in magazines and journals.Penelope Rosemont, Surrealist Women 1998, University of Texas Press In 1932 Cahun joined the Association des √âcrivains et Artistes R√©volutionnaires, where they met Andr√© Breton and Ren√© Crevel. Following this, they started associating with the surrealist group, and later participated in a number of surrealist exhibitions, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition (New Burlington Gallery) and Exposition surr√©aliste d'Objets (Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris), both in 1936. Cahun's photograph from the London exhibition of Sheila Legge standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square, their head obscured by a flower arrangement and pigeons perching on their outstretched arms, appeared in numerous newspapers and was later reproduced in a number of books. In 1934, Cahun published a short polemic essay, Les Paris sont Ouverts, and in 1935 took part in the founding of the left-wing anti-fascist alliance Contre Attaque, alongside Andr√© Breton and Georges Bataille. Breton called Cahun \\"one of the most curious spirits of our time.\\" In 1994 the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London held an exhibition of Cahun's photographic self-portraits from 1927‚Äì47, alongside the work of two young contemporary British artists, Virginia Nimarkoh and Tacita Dean, entitled Mise en Scene. In the surrealist self-portraits, Cahun represented themself as an androgyne, nymph, model, and soldier.Katy Deepwell ' Uncanny Resemblances: Restaging Claude Cahun in 'Mise en Scene issue 1 Dec 1996 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online pp. 46‚Äì51 In 2007, David Bowie created a multi-media exhibition of Cahun's work in the gardens of the General Theological Seminary in New York. It was part of a venue called the Highline Festival, which also included offerings by Air, Laurie Anderson, and Mike Garson. Bowie said of Cahun: > You could call her transgressive or you could call her a cross dressing Man > Ray with surrealist tendencies. I find this work really quite mad, in the > nicest way. Outside of France and now the UK she has not had the kind of > recognition that, as a founding follower, friend and worker of the original > surrealist movement, she surely deserves.\\" = Collaboration with Marcel Moore = Cahun's work was often a collaboration with Marcel Moore. Cahun and Moore collaborated frequently, though this often goes unrecognized. It is believed that Moore was often the person standing behind the camera during Cahun's portrait shoots and was an equal partner in their collages. With the majority of the photographs attributed to Cahun coming from a personal collection, not one meant for public display, it has been proposed that these personal photographs allowed for Cahun to experiment with gender presentation and the role of the viewer to a greater degree. World War II activism In 1937 Cahun and Moore settled in Jersey. Following the fall of France and the German occupation of Jersey and the other Channel Islands, they became active as resistance workers and propagandists. Fervently against war, the two worked extensively in producing anti-German fliers. Many were snippets from English-to-German translations of BBC reports on the Nazis' crimes and insolence, which were pasted together to create rhythmic poems and harsh criticism. The couple then dressed up and attended many German military events in Jersey, strategically placing their in soldier's pockets, on their chairs, and in cigarette boxes for soldiers to find. Additionally, they inconspicuously crumpled up and threw their fliers into cars and windows. In many ways, Cahun and Moore's resistance efforts were not only political but artistic actions, using their creative talents to manipulate and undermine the authority which they despised. In many ways, Cahun's life's work was focused on undermining a certain authority; however, their activism posed a threat to her physical safety. In 1944, Cahun and Moore were arrested and sentenced to death, but the sentence was never carried out as the island was liberated from German occupation in 1945. However, Cahun's health never recovered from their treatment in jail, and they died in 1954. Cahun is buried in St Brelade's Church with partner Marcel Moore. Social critique and legacy Claude Cahun's gravestone in the cemetery of St. Brelade's Church, Jersey Cahun made work for themself and did not want to be famous. It wasn't until 40 years after their death that Cahun's work became recognized. In many ways, Cahun's life was marked by a sense of role reversal, and like many early queer pioneers, their public identity became a commentary upon the public's notions of sexuality, gender, beauty, and logic. their adoption of a gender neutral name and their androgynous self-portraits display a revolutionary way of thinking and creating, experimenting with the audience's understanding of photography as a documentation of reality. Their poetry challenged gender roles and attacked the increasingly modern world's social and economic boundaries. Also, Cahun's participation in the Parisian Surrealist movement diversified the group's artwork and ushered in new representations. Most Surrealist artists were men, and their primary images were of women depicted as isolated symbols of eroticism. Cahun epitomized the chameleonic and various possibilities of genders and of the body. Their photographs, writings, and general life as an artistic and political revolutionary continue to influence artists. Cahun's collected writings were published in 2002 as Claude Cahun ‚Äì √âcrits (), edited by Fran√ßois Leperlier. all√©e Claude Cahun-Marcel Moore' in the 6th arrondissement of Paris In 2018, a street of Paris took the name of \\"All√©e Claude Cahun - Marcel Moore\\"Conseil de Paris (area of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s - Montparnasse, near the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Claude and Suzanne lived). Rupert Thomson's 2018 novel, Never Anyone But You, was based on the life of Cahun and Moore.

A standard rate turn is defined as a 3¬∞ per second turn, which completes a 360¬∞ turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180¬∞/min). Fast airplanes, or aircraft on certain precision approaches, use a half standard rate ('rate half' in some countries), but the definition of standard rate does not change.  Usage  coordinated right turn. Standardized turn rates are often employed in approaches and holding patterns to provide a reference for controllers and pilots so that each will know what the other is expecting. The pilot banks the airplane such that the turn and slip indicator points to the mark appropriate for that aircraft and then uses a clock to time the turn. The pilot can roll out at any desired direction depending on the length of time in the turn. During a constant-bank level turn, increasing airspeed decreases the rate of turn, and increases the turn radius.Jeppeson Sanderson, Inc., \\"Guided Flight Discovery Instrument Commercial,\\" Jeppeson, Englewood, Colorado, 2015. P. 2-8. A rate half turn (1.5¬∞ per second) is normally used when flying faster than 250 kn. The term rate two turn (6¬∞ per second) is used on some low speed aircraft. = Instrumentation = Instruments, either the turn and slip indicator or the turn coordinator, have the standard rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft are equipped with 2-minute turn indicators while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute turn indicators.  Formulae  = Angle of bank formula = The formula for calculating the angle of bank for a specific true airspeed (TAS) in SI units (or other coherent system) is:LuizMonteiro.com Aviation Education \\\\phi = \\\\arctan \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{t}^2}{rg} where \\\\phi is the angle of bank, v_\\\\text{t} is true airspeed, r is the radius of the turn, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. For a rate-one turn and velocity in knots (nautical miles per hour, symbol kn), this comes to \\\\phi = \\\\arctan \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{t} / \\\\text{kn}} {364}. A convenient approximation for the bank angle in degrees is \\\\phi / ^\\\\circ \\\\approx \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{t} / \\\\text{kn}} {10} + 7 For aircraft holding purposes, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates that all turns should be made, \\"at a bank angle of 25¬∞ or at a rate of 3¬∞ per second, whichever requires the lesser bank.\\" By the above formula, a rate-one turn at a TAS greater than 180 knots would require a bank angle of more than 25¬∞. Therefore, faster aircraft just use 25¬∞ for their turns. = Radius of turn formula = One might also want to calculate the radius r of a Rate 1, 2 or 3 turn at a specific TAS. r/\\\\text{NM} = \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{t} / \\\\text{kn}} {20 \\\\pi [\\\\omega_\\\\text{turn} / (^\\\\circ / \\\\text{s})] } Where \\\\omega_\\\\text{turn} is the rate of turn.

This small city features a living history museum (operated by the non-profit Old Salem Museums & Gardens, organized as Old Salem Inc.) that interprets the restored Moravian community. The non-profit organization began its work in 1950, although some private residents had restored buildings earlier. As the Old Salem Historic District, it was declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1966. and and expanded in 2016.https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/FY8775.pdf The district showcases the culture of the Moravian settlement in North Carolina during the 18th and 19th centuries, communal buildings, churches, houses, and shops. Two buildings are individually designated as NHL: the Salem Tavern and the Single Brothers' House. Additional buildings and properties have been added to the National Register that expand the historic area (see St. Philips Moravian Church below, Single Brothers Industrial Complex Site, and West Salem Historic District). Ownership of the buildings and land is divided among Old Salem, Inc., Wachovia Historical Society, private owners, Salem College and Academy, and Salem Congregation (the successor to the Salem Congregational Council to whom all ownership of Church properties was transferred). Historic Salem Salem was originally settled by members of the Moravian Church, a Protestant denomination that first began in 1457, out of the followers of John Huss (Jan Hus, 1369‚Äì1415) in the Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia, now part of the Czech Republic. In 1722, the German-speaking exiles finally found protection on the estate of Count Zinzendorf, a Saxon nobleman, where he allowed them to create the village of Herrnhut as their home. First settling in North America in Savannah, Georgia in 1735, they moved to Pennsylvania in 1740, where they founded several communities (Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Lititz). Because of development pressures, they looked for more space to create their church communities. Purchasing just over from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, one of the British Lords Proprietor, in the Piedmont of North Carolina in 1753, they sent groups from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to begin construction. They founded the transitional settlement of Bethabara, North Carolina (translated as \\"House of Passage,\\" the first planned Moravian community in North Carolina in 1753, in Bethania, North Carolina) in 1759. Salem was to be the central town of a tract named Wachovia. Construction began in 1766 to build the central economic, religious, and administrative center of the Wachovia tract. The outlying communities, eventually five in all (Bethabara, Bethania, Friedberg, Friedland, and Hope), were more rural and agriculture focused. Salem and most of the other communities were controlled by the church, which owned all property and only leased land for construction. All people in the communities had to be members of the church and could be expelled from the town if they acted contrary to the community's regulations. The several governing bodies all kept meticulous records; copies were sent to the Bethlehem and Herrnhut archives. Most of this information has been translated and published in the \\"Records of the Moravians in North Carolina\\" by the North Carolina State Archives, now comprising 13 volumes. This detailed information is part of the documentation used for the accurate restoration and interpretation of Old Salem and many original documents are still housed in the Moravian Archives. * In 1849, Forsyth County was created, but Salem was unwilling to be the county seat and sold property directly to the north to become the new courthouse town. This town became Winston, which quickly grew into a thriving industrial center. * In 1857, the church divested control of the town and allowed the residents to purchase their property. Salem then became a legal municipality. The town expanded twice, in 1889 and 1907. * Salem merged with adjacent Winston in 1913, becoming known as Winston-Salem. This was the only community to ever be officially designated as a hyphenated name for a Post Office by the US Postal Service. A local architectural review district was created in 1948 (the first in North Carolina and probably the fifth in the country) to protect the historic remains of what had become a depressed area from encroaching development.Griffin, 1985. In 1950, Old Salem Inc. (a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation) was formed to protect threatened buildings, restore the town, and operate portions of it as a museum. Old Salem Museums & Gardens The town's restored and reconstructed buildings, staffed by living-history interpreters, present visitors with a view of Moravian life in the 18th and 19th centuries. The features include skilled interpreters such as tinsmiths, blacksmiths, cobblers, gunsmiths, bakers and carpenters, practicing their trades while interacting with visitors. Approximately 70% of the buildings in the historic district are original, making this a truly unique living history museum. A museum interpreter explains aspects of a 19th-century apothecary in Old Salem Old Salem also offers a great deal of opportunities for the community to interact with each other by supporting local non-profit venues such as The Cobblestone Farmers Market. The Cobblestone Farmers Market encourages community engagement by creating a space to support low income households. This is accomplished by providing vendors to the community that allow purchases of healthy foods through EBT and SNAP = Hidden Town Project = Starting in December of 2016, substantial historical and archaeological research has focused on Salem's historical African-American population. Moravians educated enslaved members of their community, teaching literacy skills and some professional trades. Holistic studies directed toward understanding ethnicity and cultural identity of African-Americans in Salem have resulted in significant additions to the historical interpretation presented at Old Salem. These additions include newly identified slave dwellings and the updated number of slaves who lived in Salem from 1790-1860. The goals of this project are to: # To locate the sites of dwelling places of enslaved people throughout the entire historic district # To archaeologically investigate the sites. # To fully integrate the narrative of the enslaved into the visitor experience. # To connect with descendants of the Salem enslaved population and form an Advisory Committee to help direct future efforts at Old Salem. # To interpret through contemporary art forms, salon discussions, and public gatherings. =Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts= A part of Old Salem Museums & Gardens and located in a modern building in the historic district, the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts (MESDA) is dedicated to exhibiting and researching the regional decorative arts of the early South. MESDA opened to the public on January 5, 1965. MESDA was a vision shared by two individuals, Frank L. Horton and his mother Theodosia ‚ÄúTheo‚Äù L. Taliaferro. They were introducing collectors who have spent most of their lives raising awareness of and appreciating domestic objects made in the south. In its galleries, MESDA showcases the architecture, needlework, furniture, paintings, textiles, ceramics, silver, and other metalwares made and used in Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee through the early 19th century. The majority of the MESDA collection is accessible online. Town features Highlights of the town include the Salem Tavern, where George Washington spent two nights (May 31 and June 1, 1791), while passing through North Carolina during his \\"Southern Tour\\"; the Single Brothers' House; Boys' School; Winkler Bakery; and a host of restored homes and shops, and several stores including T. Bagge Merchant and the Moravian Book and Gift Shop. Of note is the St. Philip's Moravian Church complex. Site of an 18th-century graveyard, the (now reconstructed) 1823 'Negro Church' was built following a congregational vote to segregate worship in accordance with North Carolina state law in 1816. Before that the African-Americans who joined the Moravian church attended Home Moravian Church. In 1861, St. Philip's Church was constructed. Now restored, the church was originally built by the Salem congregation for the enslaved and free African-Americans of the community. Completed just before the Civil War in 1861, it is the oldest surviving African-American church built for that purpose in North Carolina. The Emancipation Proclamation was read there to the congregation in 1865 by the chaplain of the 10th Ohio Regiment. The church continued to grow and was expanded in the 1890s. The congregation moved to a new location in 1952 then a third location on Bon Aire Avenue, before returning to hold services in the brick Church in 2019. The building stood vacant from 1952 until its restoration. St. Philip's Church is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Partially in the Old Salem historic district is the campus of Salem College and Academy, with Main Hall, the Single Sisters' House, the Inspectors House (with the president's office and the college book store) on the Square, and Gramley Library just down Church Street. Home Moravian Church, while not a part of the official Old Salem tour per se, this functioning congregation opens its sanctuary to visitors on a regular schedule. Still owned by the Salem Congregation, Salem Square, in the center of the district, hosts many special events throughout the year, including a long-running band concert series in the summer. The famous water pump, a restored portion of Salem's circa 1778 waterworks, stands on the southwest corner of the square. In Salem, the \\"Easter City,\\" the traditional Moravian Easter Sunrise service has been held annually since 1772 by the Salem Congregation, and draws several thousand people to the Salem Square and Moravian graveyard. The first two weeks of December play host to the Candle Tea, an annual fundraiser for local charities held by the Home Moravian Church Women's Fellowship in the Single Brothers' House. The Market-Fire Engine House was constructed in 1803 (reconstructed in 1955). Half of it was used as a marketplace for fresh meat, and the other half was used to store fire fighting equipment. The town had been using this equipment since 1785, when the Salem Tavern was destroyed by fire. The fire company is thought to be the first of its kind in North Carolina. At the north end of the historic district is a large Coffee Pot which is a former tin shop sign, moved when Interstate 40 was built just to the north. Visitor center Old Salem Visitation Center Old Salem's Visitor Center was built in 2003 and is the main location where museum visitors purchase tickets. The building features a large concourse along a serpentine glass wall with interpretive panels about the history of Wachovia and Salem. The preliminary design was developed by Venturi Scott Brown and Associates, with local firm Calloway, Johnson, Moore, and West completing the project. The building also houses a food service, gift shops, and the James A. Gray Jr. Auditorium. The Gray Auditorium is home to the 1800 Tannenberg Organ. The former 1964 visitor center and parking lot were demolished to allow partial reconstruction of the 18th-century Single Brothers' Garden.

Word history The designation \\"running footman\\" derived from the attendants who ran beside or behind the carriages of aristocrats, many of whom were chosen for their physical attributes. They ran alongside the coach to make sure it was not overturned by such obstacles as ditches or tree roots. They would also run ahead to prepare the destination place for their lord's arrival.Olmert, Michael (1996). Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History, p.87. Simon & Schuster, New York. . The word was subsequently extended to apply to a household servant, who usually filled glasses, placed and removed dishes etc. while standing at meals, while the master and guests remained seated.The Concise Oxford Dictionary, The roughly synonymous term lackey may have a similar etymology. Roles The first footman was the designation given to the highest-ranking servant of this class in a given household. The first footman would serve as deputy butler and act as butler in the latter's absence, although some larger houses also had an under-butler above the first footman. In a larger household, various footmen might be assigned specific duties (for which there might be a traditional sequence), such as the silver specialist. Usually the footmen performed a range of duties which included serving meals, opening and closing doors, carrying heavy items, or moving furniture for the housemaid to clean behind. The footmen might also double as valets, especially for visiting guests. Servants Male servants were paid more than female servants, and footmen were something of a luxury and therefore a status symbol even among the servant-employing classes. They performed a less essential role than the cook, maid or even butler, and were part only of the grandest households. Since a footman was for show as much as for use, a tall footman was more highly prized than a short one, and good looks, including well-turned legs, which were shown off by the traditional footman's dress of stockings worn below knee breeches, were an advantage. Footmen were expected to be unmarried and tended to be relatively young; they might, however, progress to other posts, notably that of butler. One 19th-century footman, William Tayler, kept a diary which has been published. He was, in fact, married; but kept his marriage secret from his employers and visited his family only on his days off. Once a commonly employed servant in great houses, footmen became much rarer after World War I as fewer households could by then afford retinues of servants and retainers. The position is now virtually a historic one although servants with this designation are still employed in the British Royal Household, wearing a distinctive scarlet livery on state occasions.\\"Except at public functions, the last time I saw a footman in livery was in 1921\\": George Orwell writing in the Tribune of 3 March 1944 =Famous fictional footmen= * In Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts' Fish Footman delivers a croquet invitation to the Duchess's Frog Footman, which he then delivers to the Duchess. * George (Richard E.

A water supply system typically includes: # A drainage basin (see water purification - sources of drinking water). # A raw water collection point (above or below ground) where the water accumulates, such as a lake, a river, or groundwater from an underground aquifer. Raw water may be transferred using uncovered ground-level aqueducts, covered tunnels or underground water pipes to water purification facilities. # Water purification facilities. Treated water is transferred using water pipes (usually underground). # Water storage facilities such as reservoirs, water tanks, or water towers. Smaller water systems may store the water in cisterns or pressure vessels. Tall buildings may also need to store water locally in pressure vessels in order for the water to reach the upper floors. # Additional water pressurizing components such as pumping stations may need to be situated at the outlet of underground or above ground reservoirs or cisterns (if gravity flow is impractical). # A pipe network for distribution of water to the consumers (which may be private houses or industrial, commercial or institution establishments) and other usage points (such as fire hydrants). # Connections to the sewers (underground pipes, or aboveground ditches in some developing countries) are generally found downstream of the water consumers, but the sewer system is considered to be a separate system, rather than part of the water supply system. Water supply networks are often run by public utilities of the water industry. Water abstraction and raw water transfer Raw water (untreated) is collected from a surface water source (such as an intake on a lake or a river) or from a groundwater source (such as a water well drawing from an underground aquifer) within the watershed that provides the water resource. The raw water is transferred to the water purification facilities using uncovered aqueducts, covered tunnels or underground water pipes. Water treatment Virtually all large systems must treat the water; a fact that is tightly regulated by global, state and federal agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Water treatment must occur before the product reaches the consumer and afterwards (when it is discharged again). Water purification usually occurs close to the final delivery points to reduce pumping costs and the chances of the water becoming contaminated after treatment. Traditional surface water treatment plants generally consists of three steps: clarification, filtration and disinfection. Clarification refers to the separation of particles (dirt, organic matter, etc.) from the water stream. Chemical addition (i.e. alum, ferric chloride) destabilizes the particle charges and prepares them for clarification either by settling or floating out of the water stream. Sand, anthracite or activated carbon filters refine the water stream, removing smaller particulate matter. While other methods of disinfection exist, the preferred method is via chlorine addition. Chlorine effectively kills bacteria and most viruses and maintains a residual to protect the water supply through the supply network. Water distribution network USA Not Combined City Water System The Central Arizona Project Aqueduct transfers untreated water Most (treated) water distribution happens through underground pipes Pressurizing the water is required between the small water reserve and the end-user The product, delivered to the point of consumption, is called potable water if it meets the water quality standards required for human consumption. The water in the supply network is maintained at positive pressure to ensure that water reaches all parts of the network, that a sufficient flow is available at every take-off point and to ensure that untreated water in the ground cannot enter the network. The water is typically pressurised by pumping the water into storage tanks constructed at the highest local point in the network. One network may have several such service reservoirs. In small domestic systems, the water may be pressurised by a pressure vessel or even by an underground cistern (the latter however does need additional pressurizing). This eliminates the need of a water-tower or any other heightened water reserve to supply the water pressure. These systems are usually owned and maintained by local governments, such as cities, or other public entities, but are occasionally operated by a commercial enterprise (see water privatization). Water supply networks are part of the master planning of communities, counties, and municipalities. Their planning and design requires the expertise of city planners and civil engineers, who must consider many factors, such as location, current demand, future growth, leakage, pressure, pipe size, pressure loss, fire fighting flows, etc. ‚Äî using pipe network analysis and other tools. As water passes through the distribution system, the water quality can degrade by chemical reactions and biological processes. Corrosion of metal pipe materials in the distribution system can cause the release of metals into the water with undesirable aesthetic and health effects. Release of iron from unlined iron pipes can result in customer reports of \\"red water\\" at the tap. Release of copper from copper pipes can result in customer reports of \\"blue water\\" and/or a metallic taste. Release of lead can occur from the solder used to join copper pipe together or from brass fixtures. Copper and lead levels at the consumer's tap are regulated to protect consumer health. Utilities will often adjust the chemistry of the water before distribution to minimize its corrosiveness. The simplest adjustment involves control of pH and alkalinity to produce a water that tends to passivate corrosion by depositing a layer of calcium carbonate. Corrosion inhibitors are often added to reduce release of metals into the water. Common corrosion inhibitors added to the water are phosphates and silicates. Maintenance of a biologically safe drinking water is another goal in water distribution. Typically, a chlorine based disinfectant, such as sodium hypochlorite or monochloramine is added to the water as it leaves the treatment plant. Booster stations can be placed within the distribution system to ensure that all areas of the distribution system have adequate sustained levels of disinfection. =Topologies= Like electric power lines, roads, and microwave radio networks, water systems may have a loop or branch network topology, or a combination of both. The piping networks are circular or rectangular. If any one section of water distribution main fails or needs repair, that section can be isolated without disrupting all users on the network. Most systems are divided into zones. Factors determining the extent or size of a zone can include hydraulics, telemetry systems, history, and population density. Sometimes systems are designed for a specific area then are modified to accommodate development. Terrain affects hydraulics and some forms of telemetry. While each zone may operate as a stand-alone system, there is usually some arrangement to interconnect zones in order to manage equipment failures or system failures. Water network maintenance Water supply networks usually represent the majority of assets of a water utility. Systematic documentation of maintenance works using a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a key to a successful operation of a water utility. Clean drinking water is essential to human life. Sustainable urban water supply  A sustainable urban water supply network covers all the activities related to provision of potable water. Sustainable development is of increasing importance for the water supply to urban areas. Incorporating innovative water technologies into water supply systems improves water supply from sustainable perspectives. The development of innovative water technologies provides flexibility to the water supply system, generating a fundamental and effective means of sustainability based on an integrated real options approach. Water is an essential natural resource for human existence. It is needed in every industrial and natural process, for example, it is used for oil refining, for liquid-liquid extraction in hydro- metallurgical processes, for cooling, for scrubbing in the iron and the steel industry, and for several operations in food processing facilities. It is necessary to adopt a new approach to design urban water supply networks; water shortages are expected in the forthcoming decades and environmental regulations for water utilization and waste-water disposal are increasingly stringent. To achieve a sustainable water supply network, new sources of water are needed to be developed, and to reduce environmental pollution. The price of water is increasing, so less water must be wasted and actions must be taken to prevent pipeline leakage. Shutting down the supply service to fix leaks is less and less tolerated by consumers. A sustainable water supply network must monitor the freshwater consumption rate and the waste-water generation rate. Many of the urban water supply networks in developing countries face problems related to population increase, water scarcity, and environmental pollution. =Population growth= In 1900 just 13% of the global population lived in cities. By 2005, 49% of the global population lived in urban areas. In 2030 it is predicted that this statistic will rise to 60%. Attempts to expand water supply by governments are costly and often not sufficient. The building of new illegal settlements makes it hard to map, and make connections to, the water supply, and leads to inadequate water management. In 2002, there were 158 million people with inadequate water supply. An increasing number of people live in slums, in inadequate sanitary conditions, and are therefore at risk of disease. =Water scarcity= Potable water is not well distributed in the world. 1.8 million deaths are attributed to unsafe water supplies every year, according to the WHO. Many people do not have any access, or do not have access to quality and quantity of potable water, though water itself is abundant. Poor people in developing countries can be close to major rivers, or be in high rainfall areas, yet not have access to potable water at all. There are also people living where lack of water creates millions of deaths every year. Where the water supply system cannot reach the slums, people manage to use hand pumps, to reach the pit wells, rivers, canals, swamps and any other source of water. In most cases the water quality is unfit for human consumption. The principal cause of water scarcity is the growth in demand. Water is taken from remote areas to satisfy the needs of urban areas. Another reason for water scarcity is climate change: precipitation patterns have changed; rivers have decreased their flow; lakes are drying up; and aquifers are being emptied. =Governmental issues= In developing countries many governments are corrupt and poor and they respond to these problems with frequently changing policies and non clear agreements. Water demand exceeds supply, and household and industrial water supplies are prioritised over other uses, which leads to water stress. Potable water has a price in the market; water often becomes a business for private companies, which earn a profit by putting a higher price on water, which imposes a barrier for lower-income people. The Millennium Development Goals propose the changes required. In advanced economies, the problems are about optimising existing supply networks. These economies have usually had continuing evolution, which allowed them to construct infrastructure to supply water to people. The European Union has developed a set of rules and policies to overcome expected future problems. There are many international documents with interesting, but not very specific, ideas and therefore they are not put into practice.van der Steen, Peter. (2006). ‚ÄúIntegrated Urban Water Management: towards sustainability‚Äù. Environmental Resources Department. UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education. SWITCH. Recommendations have been made by the United Nations, such as the Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development.  Optimizing the water supply network  The yield of a system can be measured by either its value or its net benefit. For a water supply system, the true value or the net benefit is a reliable water supply service having adequate quantity and good quality of the product. For example, if the existing water supply of a city needs to be extended to supply a new municipality, the impact of the new branch of the system must be designed to supply the new needs, while maintaining supply to the old system. =Single-objective optimization= The design of a system is governed by multiple criteria, one being cost. If the benefit is fixed, the least cost design results in maximum benefit. However, the least cost approach normally results in a minimum capacity for a water supply network. A minimum cost model usually searches for the least cost solution (in pipe sizes), while satisfying the hydraulic constraints such as: required output pressures, maximum pipe flow rate and pipe flow velocities. The cost is a function of pipe diameters; therefore the optimization problem consists of finding a minimum cost solution by optimising pipe sizes to provide the minimum acceptable capacity. =Multi-objective optimization= However, according to the authors of the paper entitled, ‚ÄúMethod for optimizing design and rehabilitation of water distribution systems‚Äù, ‚Äúthe least capacity is not a desirable solution to a sustainable water supply network in a long term, due to the uncertainty of the future demand‚Äù. It is preferable to provide extra pipe capacity to cope with unexpected demand growth and with water outages. The problem changes from a single objective optimization problem (minimizing cost), to a multi-objective optimization problem (minimizing cost and maximizing flow capacity). =Weighted sum method= To solve a multi-objective optimization problem, it is necessary to convert the problem into a single objective optimization problem, by using adjustments, such as a weighted sum of objectives, or an Œµ-constraint method. The weighted sum approach gives a certain weight to the different objectives, and then factors in all these weights to form a single objective function that can be solved by single factor optimization. This method is not entirely satisfactory, because the weights cannot be correctly chosen, so this approach cannot find the optimal solution for all the original objectives. =The constraint method= The second approach (the constraint method), chooses one of the objective functions as the single objective, and the other objective functions are treated as constraints with a limited value. However, the optimal solution depends on the pre-defined constraint limits. = Sensitivity analysis = The multiple objective optimization problems involve computing the tradeoff between the costs and benefits resulting in a set of solutions that can be used for sensitivity analysis and tested in different scenarios. But there is no single optimal solution that will satisfy the global optimality of both objectives. As both objectives are to some extent contradictory, it is not possible to improve one objective without sacrificing the other. It is necessary in some cases use a different approach. (e.g. Pareto Analysis), and choose the best combination. = Operational constraints = Returning to the cost objective function, it cannot violate any of the operational constraints. Generally this cost is dominated by the energy cost for pumping. ‚ÄúThe operational constraints include the standards of customer service, such us: the minimum delivered pressure, in addition to the physical constraints such us the maximum and the minimum water levels in storage tanks to prevent overtopping and emptying respectively.‚Äù In order to optimize the operational performance of the water supply network, at the same time as minimizing the energy costs, it is necessary to predict the consequences of different pump and valve settings on the behavior of the network. Apart from Linear and Non-linear Programming, there are other methods and approaches to design, to manage and operate a water supply network to achieve sustainability‚Äîfor instance, the adoption of appropriate technology coupled with effective strategies for operation and maintenance. These strategies must include effective management models, technical support to the householders and industries, sustainable financing mechanisms, and development of reliable supply chains. All these measures must ensure the following: system working lifespan; maintenance cycle; continuity of functioning; down time for repairs; water yield and water quality.  Sustainable development  In an unsustainable system there is insufficient maintenance of the water networks, especially in the major pipe lines in urban areas. The system deteriorates and then needs rehabilitation or renewal. Sustainable development in an urban water network Householders and sewage treatment plants can both make the water supply networks more efficient and sustainable. Major improvements in eco-efficiency are gained through systematic separation of rainfall and wastewater. Membrane technology can be used for recycling wastewater. The municipal government can develop a ‚ÄúMunicipal Water Reuse System‚Äù which is a current approach to manage the rainwater. It applies a water reuse scheme for treated wastewater, on a municipal scale, to provide non-potable water for industry, household and municipal uses. This technology consists in separating the urine fraction of sanitary wastewater, and collecting it for recycling its nutrients.Craddock Consulting Engineering. ‚ÄúRecycling treated municipal wastewater for industrial water use‚Äù. (2007). The feces and graywater fraction is collected, together with organic wastes from the households, using a gravity sewer system, continuously flushed with non- potable water. The water is treated anaerobically and the biogas is used for energy production. The sustainable water supply system is an integrated system including water intake, water utilization, wastewater discharge and treatment and water environmental protection. It requires reducing freshwater and groundwater usage in all sectors of consumption. Developing sustainable water supply systems is a growing trend, because it serves people's long-term interests.Qiang, He. Li Zhai Jun, Huang. ‚ÄúApplication of Sustainable Water System the Demonstration in Chengdu (China)‚Äù. (2008). There are several ways to reuse and recycle the water, in order to achieve long-term sustainability, such us: *Gray water re-use and treatment: gray water is wastewater coming from baths, showers, sinks and washbasins. If this water is treated it can be used as a source of water for uses other than drinking. Depending on the type of gray water and its level of treatment, it can be re-used for irrigation and toilet flushing. According to an investigation about the impacts of domestic grey water reuse on public health, carried out by the New South Wales Health Centre in Australia in the year 2000, grey water contains less nitrogen and fecal pathogenic organisms than sewage, and the organic content of grey water decomposes more rapidly. * Ecological treatment systems use little energy: there are many applications in gray water re-use, such us reed beds, soil treatment systems and plant filters. This process is ideal for gray water re- use, because of easier maintenance and higher removal rates of organic matter, ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus. Other possible approaches to scoping models for water supply, applicable to any urban area, include the following: * Sustainable drainage system * Borehole extraction * Intercluster groundwater flow * Canal and river extraction * Aquifer storage * A more user-friendly indoor water use The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development is a good example of the new trend to overcome water supply problems. This statement, suggested by advanced economies, has come up with some principles that are of great significance to urban water supply. These are: #Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment. #Water development and management should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels. #Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water. Institutional arrangements should reflect the role of women in water provision and protection. #Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good. From these statements, developed in 1992, several policies have been created to give importance to water and to move urban water system management towards sustainable development. The Water Framework Directive by the European Commission is a good example of what has been created there out of former policies.  Future approaches  There is great need for a more sustainable water supply systems. To achieve sustainability several factors must be tackled at the same time: climate change, rising energy cost, and rising populations. All of these factors provoke change and put pressure on management of available water resources.Last, Ewan. Mackay, Rae. ‚ÄúDeveloping a New Scoping Model for Urban Sustainability‚Äù. (2007). An obstacle to transforming conventional water supply systems, is the amount of time needed to achieve the transformation. More specifically, transformation must be implemented by municipal legislation bodies, which always need short-term solutions too. Another obstacle to achieving sustainability in water supply systems is the insufficient practical experience with the technologies required, and the missing know-how about the organization and the transition process. Possible ways to improve this situation is simulating of the network, implementing pilot projects, learning from the costs involved and the benefits achieved.

Wasserbillig is the administrative seat of the commune of Mertert. Geography Wasserbillig lies at the confluence of the rivers Moselle and Sauer, which form the border with Germany at the town. On the opposite side of the Moselle and linked by a car ferry lies Oberbillig, Germany; on the opposite side of the Sauer and linked by vehicle and rail bridges lies Wasserbilligerbr√ºck, Germany. Wasserbillig is the lowest settlement in Luxembourg, at above sea level. History Around 100 AD, there was already a town where Wasserbillig is situated which the Roman named Biliacum. This is also where the second part of Wasserbillig's name comes from (-billig from Biliacum). It was mainly a transloading harbour for goods coming down the Sauer or by cart. During the construction of the bridge over the Sauer in 1952, remnants of an old Roman bridge were found. Economy and Tourism Wasserbillig is home to the large Wasserbillig Aquarium with tanks of up to exhibiting fish from around the world in natural surroundings. Despite its small population, Wasserbillig is home to ExxonMobil's largest petrol station, which serves the A1 motorway, leading into Germany. This is due to the considerably lower fuel taxes in Luxembourg than in Germany, making it highly advantageous not only for motorists and truckers to fill their tanks before crossing the border into Germany but also for residents of the surrounding areas in Germany, notably the nearby city of Trier, to cross the border to purchase fuel in Luxembourg. The service area is similarly a large outlet for tobacco (which like fuel also attracts considerable cross-border custom from the surrounding areas of Germany due to the difference in taxes), coffee and chocolate.

The \\"anti-star\\" was born in Derby, Derbyshire, England, and died in his adopted home of Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany. Coyne is notable for his unorthodox style of blues-influenced guitar composition, the intense quality of his vocal delivery, and his bold treatment of injustice to the mentally ill in his lyrics. Many influential musicians have described themselves as Coyne fans, among them Sting and John Lydon. In the mid-1970s, prior to the formation of the Police, Coyne's band included guitarist Andy Summers. Prominent BBC disc jockey and world music authority Andy Kershaw described Coyne as \\"a national treasure who keeps getting better\\" and as one of the great British blues voices. Over many years Coyne produced the distinctive art work for many of his own album covers but his move to Germany, in the 1980s, saw his work on full-size paintings blossom in its own right.  Early days  As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents. At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever ‚Äì he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for \\"The Soho Project\\" in London as a drugs counsellor. During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969. Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne's band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just \\"Clague\\"), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band's 1971 LP Strange Locomotion, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne's humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band's wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: 'Fetch Me My Woman,' which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.\\"  An established artist  In 1973 he appeared on the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test, performing \\"I Want My Crown\\" and \\"House on the Hill\\" with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles. In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical England, England, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as \\"an evocation of the Kray Twins\\". The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed on stage in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It was one of the first theatre pieces to reference the fascist associations of a kind of British nationalism that later became more prevalent with the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherds Bush. In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film The Institution based on Breakwell's Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne's band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. \\"I didn't like the leather trousers!\\" was Coynes' alleged reason. Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield, where he continued his uncompromising stance. It was this attitude that endeared him to label-mates such as John Lydon, who played \\"Eastbourne Ladies\\" on a Desert Island Discs‚Äìtype show, and the Mekons, who recorded his \\"Having a Party\\", a scathing attack on Richard Branson. Coyne's first solo album Case History (1972), primarily with just his own voice and guitar, was powerful and direct, was recorded for Peel's Dandelion label. When Dandelion ceased to exist, the album largely sank into obscurity. But not before it had come to the attention of Virgin Records, who were sufficiently impressed to sign Coyne and release his 1973 album Marjory Razorblade. The single \\"Marlene\\" (b/w \\"Everybody Says\\"), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single. Described as being musically \\"... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge\\", the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as the bitter and irreverent \\"Eastbourne Ladies\\" and the plaintive \\"House on the Hill\\" about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that was to be largely responsible for putting Coyne on the map of mainstream rock. Advertisement for the theatre presentation of Babble, from Melody Maker, July 1979 Another Virgin album release, Babble, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, courted controversy when Kevin suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in The Sun and the Evening Standard. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote: > \\"Babble\\" is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality > of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed > is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and > chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only > accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and > acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.\\"Babble On ..\\", Paul du Noyer, New > Musical Express, 8 September 1979, p42. American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the Babble album had \\"changed my life\\" and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers ‚Äì who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of Babble, in Berlin, were included in the short German film Herz Aus Feuer (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze. The album Politicz, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic's reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as \\"One of the British singer/songwriter's more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda\\". The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Kirtley and Bull augmented by Steve Lamb on bass and Dave Wilson on drums), live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD At the Last Wall (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).  Nuremberg  Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings. A selection of Coyne's writings, including many of his poems, can be viewed on the internet. Coyne's move to Germany saw his writing and painting career truly blossom. He published four books, two of which, Showbusiness and Party Dress, were published by Serpent's Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe and the response was reassuringly strong. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Z√ºrich being particularly well reviewed and attended.Obituary in The Times: \\"Kevin Coyne ‚Äì Singer-songwriter whose experience as a therapist influenced his music and who was dedicated to remaining an outsider\\" The paintings gained some notoriety and still attract commercial attention today. In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in Linie Eins (Line One), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House, but appearing only at the very end of the play. His 1995 album, The Adventures of Crazy Frank, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle ‚Äì with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in the Guardian obituary as Kevin's wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle's wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Kevin's actual wife. In reality Kevin married only twice, first to Lesley and second to Helmi, having another relationship between the two which saw the birth of his son Nico. In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as Tough And Sweet (1993) and Sugar Candy Taxi (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including Knocking on Your Brain (1997) often featured the \\"Paradise Band\\". In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on Life Is Almost Wonderful, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on One Day in Chicago) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (on Knocking on Your Brain). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel's Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne. Siren performed all material for the film without any prior rehearsals. In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennanBangay, Frank Interview 2004  Death  Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died peacefully at his home. He is survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico. His wife Helmi intends to continue releasing recordings Kevin made in his last years on Kevin's own Turpentine Records label. The first was Underground (2006). 2007 tributes In 2007, the Nightingales recorded a version of \\"Good Boy\\" for their album Out of True, Jackie Leven recorded a song about Coyne on his album Oh What A Blow The Phantom Dealt Me!, and \\"Here Come The Urban Ravens\\" featured on the album, Whispers From The Offing ‚Äì A Tribute to Kevin Coyne, put together by Kevin's friend Frank Bangay.

In 2008 Swiss performance artist Pipilotti Rist produced a video in which she mimes \\"Jackie and Edna\\" against the background of various images, including film taken from a moving train. This video was exhibited in Helsinki's Kiasma Gallery in January 2012 as part of the \\"Thank you for the Music\\" exhibition. Critical appraisal Although Coyne has been neglected by popular music historians and academics, George McKay's 2013 book Shakin' All Over: Popular Music and Disability, features a critical discussion of Coyne's work. The book opens with an epigraph from Coyne: 'anything that rhymes with \\"me\\"' (from the song \\"Fat Girl\\" as performed on the 1977 album In Living Black and White). Describing him as 'the great lost English singer-songwriter' with his 'social-work approach to pop', McKay discusses the 1978 song \\"Having a Party\\" in the context of songs about the destructive economy of the pop industry. He also notes Coyne's 'anti-star' status and his innovative 'anti'-guitar playing: \\"Not being able, or electing not, to play the instrument \\"properly\\", and hearing other voices while singing: there is something culturally disabling about each of these artistic choices, quite apart from the lyrical terrain\\".McKay, G. 2013, Shaking' All Over: Popular Music and Disability: (Corporealities: Discourses of Disability), Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, On 15 June 2017 Coyne was commemorated with the unveiling of a blue plaque at the University of Derby Art School. In January 2018 an exhibition of Coyne's work was staged at the city gallery Alte Feuerwache in Amberg An exhibition, accompanied by a 70-page catalogue, compiled by Stefan Voit, was held from 9 June to 5 August 2018, at the St√§dtische Galerie Cordonhaus in Cham.

In them, the Symbol of Chaos comprises eight arrows in a radial pattern. In contrast, the symbol of Law is a single upright arrow. It is also called the Arms of Chaos, the Arrows of Chaos, the Chaos Star, the Chaos Cross, the Chaosphere (when depicted as a three- dimensional sphere), or the Symbol of Eight. Alternative symbols of chaos (owing nothing to Moorcock) include the Sacred Chao and the Five Fingered Hand of Eris of Discordianism. Overview Moorcock has stated that he conceived this symbol while writing the first Elric of Melnibon√© stories in the early 1960s. It was subsequently adopted into the pop-cultural mainstream, turning up in such places as modern occult traditions and role-playing games. There are a number of traditional symbols that have the same geometrical pattern as Moorcock's symbol of Chaos, such as any of various eight-pointed stars, the Star of Ishtar, the Indian Dharmacakra and the Wheel of the Year, but none of these were symbols of chaos and their limbs are not arrows. The Eight of Wands in Aleister Crowley's Thoth tarot deck features prominently an eight-pointed star with arrows at the ends. Crowley described the card as representing \\"energy\\" scattering at \\"high velocity\\" that had managed to create the depicted eight-pointed figure. Moorcock said about his version,http://www.multiverse.org/fora/showpost.php?p=104003&postcount;=4 An even-more-chaotic asymmetrical representation was by Walter Simonson in the Michael Moorcock's Multiverse comic (and subsequent graphic novel: ).  Games  The symbol's first appearance in a commercial role-playing game (RPG) was in TSR's Dungeons & Dragons supplement, Deities & Demigods which included the gods, monsters, and heroes from Moorcock's Elric books as one of 17 mythological and fictional \\"pantheons\\". Copyright problems led to its omission from later editions. It then turned up quite naturally in Chaosium's Stormbringer RPG (one edition of which was published as Elric!). The 1987 edition of Stormbringer was published jointly by Chaosium in the U.S. and Games Workshop (GW) in the UK. Moorcock's eight-arrow symbol of Chaos was subsequently used by Games Workshop and used as a frequent graphic element in their own Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 games and the related miniature figures, representing the forces of Chaos. The Games Workshop version of the symbol often incorporates a ring into its design, similar to the eight-spoked dharmachakra. Star of Chaos appears as the penultimate boss of Gradius Gaiden, in the passage between one of the last bosses (Big Ducker) and Final Boss (He shuffles the Final Enemy of the other Gradius) It has also appeared in Bungie's Xbox 360 game Halo 3: ODST as an emblem for playable multiplayer characters. It also shows in Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines, in the home of Aleister Grout, the Malkavian primogen. It further appears on an item called a \\"chaos device\\" in Heretic and HeXen. In Warcraft II, the Orc side's target mouse cursor has the form of chaos symbol. The symbol also appears in several artworks, which can be seen in game's manual and during mission briefings. The Symbol of Chaos shows up in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth expansion Afterbirth as the item \\"Chaos\\". The Chaosphere is a pick-up in the open source twin-stick-shooter heXon with a variety of effects. The symbol also appears in the background during a dialogue scene in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ‚Äì Hearts of Stone, an expansion to Witcher 3, located in the home of a professor attempting to ward off a malevolent demonic entity that plays a key role in the expansion's plot. A variant on the symbol is seen on the foreheads of the Silent Monks in 2017's Divinity: Original Sin 2  See also  *Arrow Cross *Celtic wheel *Christian cross variants  References  Chaos Chaos Category:Michael Moorcock's Multiverse Category:Chaos magic Chaos Chaos Chaos ","title":"Symbol of Chaos"},{"id":"1249195","text":"The Cassiobury Estate is a suburban residential area of Watford in Hertfordshire, England. It is bounded to the south by Cassiobury Park, the main public park in the town, to the west by playing fields next to the River Gade, and to the northeast by Hempstead Road. It is mostly characterised by 1930s Mock Tudor houses. To the northwest of Cassiobury, outside the Borough of Watford in the Three Rivers District, is The Grove, the former estate and house of the Earls of Clarendon. This has been converted into a luxury hotel and with extensive grounds. History The suburban streets of Cassiobury were laid out in the early 1930s on land that was formerly part of the estate of Cassiobury House, the ancestral seat of the Earls of Essex. The house, which originally dated from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, contained lavishly decorated interiors and a substantial art collection and was surrounded by landscaped park land. Parts of the Cassiobury estate were sold for development land in 1908, and following the death of the 7th Earl of Essex in 1916, the family put the rest of estate up for sale in order to pay for death duties. Unable to find a buyer for the house, they had Cassiobury House demolished in 1927 and the estate was partly sold to Watford Borough Council to be used as a public park, with the remaining land sold to developers such as William King & Co and Charles Brightman for housing development. With the extension of the Metropolitan Railway to Watford in 1926, residential development around the new Watford tube station grew rapidly as the homes of Metro-land were constructed over the site of the former Essex mansion, and Humphry Repton's landscaped vistas gave way to suburban lawns. The area of land once occupied by Cassiobury House is now where Temple Close sits, close to the Cassiobury Tennis Club. Although the Essex mansion house no longer exists, traces of the area's noble past remain; the Cassiobury House stable block (built c.1805-15) still stands on Richmond Drive; now called Cassiobury Court, the buildings have been Grade II listed and are now used as a drug rehabilitation centre. Several residential street names recall former Earls of Essex; Coningesby Drive, Devereux Drive, De Vere Walk and Capelvere Walk all bear names of former Lords of Cassiobury House. Geography Transport Watford Underground Station The area is currently served by a London Underground station, Watford tube station, on Cassiobury Park Avenue, which is the terminus of the Metropolitan line's Watford branch. This station is planned to close in the future when the line is diverted to terminate at as part of the Croxley Rail Link project; after this, Cassiobury will be served by a new Cassiobridge tube station instead, approximately south of the current station.

The feminine form of the surname is Nic Lochlainn.

Thus, MacLaughlin, McLaughlin and M'Laughlin are the same Anglicism, the latter two merely contractions of the first.

Unlike Irish surnames that have only one Gaelic source for their English form, it is not possible to tell by the spelling McLaughlin and other English spellings whether the person bearing the name is descended from the Mac/Nic Lochlainn family, the √ì/N√≠ M(h)«Ωilshe√°chlainn family, or the √ì/N√≠ Lachtna family.

This is different from Bulk micromachining, in which a silicon substrate wafer is selectively etched to produce structures.  Layers  Generally, polysilicon is used as one of the substrate layers while silicon dioxide is used as a sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer is removed or etched out to create any necessary void in the thickness direction. Added layers tend to vary in size from 2-5 micrometres. The main advantage of this machining process is the ability to build electronic and mechanical components (functions) on the same substrate. Surface micro-machined components are smaller compared to their bulk micro- machined counterparts. As the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the substrate's properties are not as important as in bulk micro-machining. Expensive silicon wafers can be replaced by cheaper substrates, such as glass or plastic. The size of the substrates may be larger than a silicon wafer, and surface micro-machining is used to produce thin-film transistors on large area glass substrates for flat panel displays. This technology can also be used for the manufacture of thin film solar cells, which can be deposited on glass, polyethylene terepthalate substrates or other non-rigid materials. Fabrication process Micro-machining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrate upon which new layers are grown. These layers are selectively etched by photo-lithography; either a wet etch involving an acid, or a dry etch involving an ionized gas (or plasma). Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching or ion bombardment. Surface micro-machining involves as many layers as are needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use as many as 100 layers. Micro- machining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers. Surface micro-machining uses developed technology (although sometimes not enough for demanding applications) which is easily repeatable for volume production. =Sacrificial layers= A sacrificial layer is used to build complicated components, such as movable parts. For example, a suspended cantilever can be built by depositing and structuring a sacrificial layer, which is then selectively removed at the locations where the future beams must be attached to the substrate (i.e. the anchor points). A structural layer is then deposited on top of the polymer and structured to define the beams. Finally, the sacrificial layer is removed to release the beams, using a selective etch process that does not damage the structural layer. Many combinations of structural and sacrificial layers are possible. The combination chosen depends on the process. For example, it is important for the structural layer not to be damaged by the process used to remove the sacrificial layer.

The Congo Craton, covered by the Palaeozoic-to-recent Congo Basin, is an ancient Precambrian craton that with four others (the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and West African cratons) makes up the modern continent of Africa. These cratons were formed between about 3.6 and 2.0 billion years ago and have been tectonically stable since that time. All of these cratons are bounded by younger fold belts formed between 2.0 billion and 300 million years ago. The Congo Craton occupies a large part of central southern Africa, extending from the Kasai region of the DRC into Sudan and Angola. It forms parts of the countries of Gabon, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. A small portion extends into Zambia as well, where it is called the Bangweulu Block. Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco The Congo Craton and the S√£o Francisco Craton are stable Archaean blocks that formed a coherent landmass until the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean during the break-up of Gondwana ( 2000‚Äì130 Ma). They stabilised during the Trans-Amazonian orogeny and Eburnean Orogeny and have been affected by a long series of orogens since resulting in similar sequences on both blocks. Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco experienced three large igneous province (LIP) events at 1380‚Äì1370 Ma, 1505 Ma, and 1110 Ma. The relative position of Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco within the supercontinent Nuna/Columbia can be reconstructed because these LIP events also affected other Precambrian continental blocks. Within Nuna the northern part of Siberia was located adjacent to western S√£o Francisco. 1110 Ma dyke swarms in Angola are absent in Siberia but coincide with the Umkondo LIP on the Kalahari Craton and magmatic event in the Bundelkhand Craton in India, the Amazonian Craton in South America, and the Keweenawan Rift in Laurentia (although the latter was located far from the other continental blocks). A series of 1500 Ma dyke swarms also support the close relation between Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco and Siberia: Kuonamka in Siberia and Cura√ß√° and Chapada Diamantina in S√£o Francisco and Angola. These dyke swarms radiate from a mantle plume centre located in what is now north-eastern Siberia. Magmatic events in Congo (Kunene) and Siberia (Chieress) at 1384 Ma also corroborate the closeness of these two continents during at least 120 million years. It is possible that the 1110 Ma LIP in Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco, Amazonia, and India was part of a much larger event that also involved West Africa and Kalahari (with a possible but unlikely link to the 1075 Ma Warakurna LIP in Australia). However, while the palaeo-latitudes of India and Kalahari are well constrained, those of Amazonia and Congo‚ÄìS√£o Francisco are not, making any plate tectonic reconstruction speculative. At the time for the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana at 550 the Congo Craton formed the already amalgamated central African landmass. The southern and eastern margins (modern coordinates) of this landmass was made of the Archaean Angola-Kasai block and Tanzanian Craton. These proto-Congo blocks were deformed in the Palaeoproterozoic Eburnean orogeny but later stabilised. =West Congo Belt= Before the opening of the South Atlantic the S√£o Francisco and Congo cratons were connected by a \\"cratonic\\" bridge, the Bahia‚ÄìGabon Bridge. The most recent orogenic event on this bridge occurred at 2 Ga, so the connection between S√£o Francisco and Congo must have formed during the Palaeoproterozoic. South of this cratonic bridge the Ara√ßua√≠‚ÄìWest Congo orogen evolved in the Neoproterozoic in a sea basin made of oceanic crust, an embayment in the S√£o Francisco‚ÄìCongo continent. The West Congo Pan- African Belt includes major magmatic events at 1000 and 910 Ma. In the Early Neoproterozoic, the western edge of Congo Craton was the location for the initial rifting of Rodinia before its break-up. During the Neoproterozoic, Central Congo or Bas-Congo became a passive margin on which was deposited sediments. At the end of the Neoproterozoic, Bas-Congo was only affected by the Pan-African orogeny at 566 Ma to a limited extent protected by this passive margin and by the thickness of the craton. At 1000 Ma peralkaline magmatism initiated an early transtensional setting along the western edge of the Congo Craton. An LIP at 930‚Äì920 Ma was followed by felsic magmatism between 920‚Äì910 Ma which had a short emplacement interval and resulted in a thick sequence. Mafic-felsic magma sequences ( thick) on the western edge of the Congo Craton are similar to those of the Paran√° and Deccan LIPs, but in the Congo Craton the magma source became shallower with time. There was no geodynamic activity along the western Congo margin during the Mesoproterozoic.

It is located where the mouth of the River Rouge spills into the Detroit River. Zug Island is not a natural island in the river; it was formed when a shipping canal was dug along the southwestern side of the island, allowing ships to bypass several hundred yards of twisting waterway near the mouth of the natural course of the lowest portions of the River Rouge. History Originally a marsh-filled peninsula at the mouth of the River Rouge, it served as an uninhabited Native American burial ground for thousands of years. Upon European arrival, the land was incorporated into Ecorse Township, making up the very northeast corner of the township. The beginning of interest in developing the land came when Samuel Zug, one of the founders of the Republican Party and a staunch abolitionist, came to Detroit from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania in 1836 to make his fortune in the furniture industry with the money he earned as a bookkeeper. Shortly after, Marcus Stevenson, a Detroit financier, went into business with him. The Stevenson & Zug Furniture Company flourished until 1859 when Zug, by then a rich man, dissolved the partnership. He decided to invest in real estate to provide security for his wife, Ann. Envisioning a luxurious estate on the Detroit River, Zug bought of marshy land below Fort Wayne from the town of Delray in 1876. But the dampness was too much for the Zugs and after 10 years they abandoned their home. In 1888, Zug allowed the River Rouge Improvement Company cut a small canal through the south section of his property to more directly connect the Rouge River to the Detroit River. This Short Cut Canal, as it came to be known, was enlarged in the early 1920s by Henry Ford to allow large ships to more easily navigate to the Ford River Rouge Complex). In 1891, Zug completed the largest real estate transaction of the decade: he sold his island for $300,000 to industries that wanted it as a dumping ground. Zug became interested in politics and served as Wayne County Auditor under Gov. John J. Bagley. He died in 1896 when he was 80. Coke train, Zug Island, 2009. Steel mill The Detroit Iron Works brought ironmaking to Zug Island in 1901 with the commissioning of a blast furnace built in 1902. In 1904 the works was purchased by the M.A. Hanna Company of Cleveland, Ohio which built a second blast furnace in 1909. At this time the island's two furnaces were reportedly the largest of their kind in the world, producing pig iron for foundry companies. The plant expanded and became part of the Great Lakes Steel Corporation in late 1931, becoming a key component of a fully integrated steel mill and a division of the larger National Steel Corporation. A third blast furnace was added in early 1938 while the existing furnaces were rebuilt and enlarged. When National Steel became insolvent in 2003 most of the island's facilities were purchased, along with the rest of what is now called the Great Lakes Works, by United States Steel, which currently operates the mill. The island is home to the mill's ironmaking facilities (the rest of the mill's facilities, primarily steelmaking and processing, are located at the main plant a couple miles south in the city of Ecorse) which includes 3 blast furnaces (\\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"D\\") and raw materials storage areas. Ships supply large ore docks along the north (\\"1 Dock\\") and east (\\"3 Dock\\") shores of the island and large coal/coke/ore storage fields along the south and west (\\"B Area\\") shores. Number 5 Coke Battery located there, once an integral part of the mill, is independently owned and operated by EES Coke LLC, a DTE Energy company. Delray Connecting Railroad, a U.S. Steel company, also operates some rail facilities on the island. A \\"2-way\\" vehicle/rail bridge is the main access to the island. Secondary vehicle and rail bridges (the \\"Swing Bridge\\") at the southwestern corner of the island also allow mainland access. Iron produced at Zug Island is transported in bottle cars via rail to steelmaking at the main plant while DTE's coke is shipped via rail to supply consumers, chiefly ISG/Mittal, in the merchant metallurgical market. During the industry's peak, thousands of workers were employed on the island with a large percentage of the downriver community supported by the local steel producer. Today a few hundred people work on the island with the hourly workers at U.S. Steel represented by United Steelworkers Local 1299. In fall of 2008 U.S. Steel halted its production due to the economic downturn, but restarted its production in fall of 2009. U.S. Steel announced in December 2019 that they would idle most of its operations in the area, including all of its operations on Zug Island, by April 2020. Wildlife Despite the island's extremely developed industrial landscape, areas along the south and west shores are left undeveloped to provide habitat for wildlife. Foxes and once-endangered peregrine falcons, which frequent large outdoor structures such as the gantry cranes at the ore docks, thrive on the island and offshore. At the bottom of the Detroit River is a man-made bed of coal cinders which serves as a rare spawning site for lake sturgeon, a threatened species. Less desirable are the sizable and sometimes troublesome populations of gulls, feral cats and rats. Environmental impact View of Zug Island from the Delray neighborhood of Detroit One of the most pressing problems in the neighborhoods surrounding Zug Island is poor air quality. According to an article in the January 20, 2010, edition of the Detroit Free Press, the neighborhoods around the area compose six of the ten most polluted zip codes in Michigan. In the article, residents cite air quality samples containing lead and high levels of methyl ethyl ketone, large numbers of cancer and asthma cases, and foul smells with \\"sparkly\\" dust that must be removed with toilet cleaner. Interviewed separately, residents of the area say the foul smells are strong enough to cause dry heaves. =Noise and vibration= In 2011, the Zug Island area was identified by Canadian scientists and Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources as the source of mysterious rumblings and vibrations, known as \\"The Hum\\", that have plagued hundreds of area residents with cyclical vibrations reportedly being felt in the ground up to fifty miles (eighty kilometres) away. The city of River Rouge reported in the Star that it cannot afford to spend any more money on investigating the hum. They claim the City Council had already spent over $1 million to help Windsor and Ontario find the source of the noise. However, they say it likely comes from the steel mill facilities on the island. , a Canadian scientist is using sound-level meters and a portable \\"pentangular array\\" of cameras and microphones to try to accurately identify the source of the sound, in order to know whom exactly to ask to fix it. The results of the 2013 study were released on May 23, 2014. Although contemporaneous news reports claim the study confirmed that Zug Island was the source of the hum, the report's findings actually state \\"the most probable source of the Hum points well to the South of Zug Island. The bulk of our observations from both stations do not support the hypothesis that the source of the Hum emanates from Zug Island.\\" Reports of the Hum ceased after the US Steel plant on Zug Island ceased operations in April 2020. Miscellaneous Due to its location and relative security‚Äîthe island is off-limits to the public for the most part (cameras are prohibited on the premises so pictures of the area, except from the outside, are rare)‚Äîmany urban legends exist regarding the island, the two most popular being that the island is home to a correctional facility or prison and that parts of the movie RoboCop were filmed there (due to its mention in the movie as the location). Neither claim is true as the island is not the location of any law enforcement or corrections facility. The steel mill shots in the movie were filmed at the old Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.'s Monessen Works in Pennsylvania. The SS Edmund Fitzgerald of Great Lakes shipwreck fame was laden with taconite destined for Zug Island on her fateful voyage in 1975. In 2011, Detroit based author Gregory Fournier published his novel, Zug Island: A Detroit Riot Novel. Zug Izland, a Detroit-based rock band in association with Insane Clown Posse, named themselves after the island and self describe their sound as \\"Juggalo Rock\\". ICP themselves have made references to Zug Island in their songs \\"The Shaggy Show\\", \\"In the Haughhh!\\" and \\"Toxic Love\\".
