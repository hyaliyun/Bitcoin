The generic form is coupled to a phospholipid of the outer lemma of the sensory neurons associated with the sodium ion sensitive channel (previously known as the \\"salty\\" channel) of gustation. Muco-inositol is one of nine stereo-isomers of inositol. It is the only stereo-isomer that participates in the gustatory (taste) modality. Muco- inositol is typically phosphorylated (becoming muco-inositol phosphate) in the process of being attached to a lipid of the outer lemma of the sensory neurons of taste. The final chemical is phosphatidyl muco-inositol (PtdIns). PtdIns occurs in a specialized area of the cilia of the sensory neurons where it exists in a liquid crystalline form. In this form, it is the sensory receptor of the sensory neuron forming the initial element of the sodium ion sensitive channel of gustation. Phosphatidyl inositol prepared in the laboratory without regard to the isomer involved is abbreviated as PI. Phosphatidyl inositol phosphate prepared without regard to the isomer involved is abbreviated as PIP. Generic muco-inositol alone can form a dimer with the muco-inositol moiety of the sensory receptor. Although it contains no salt, or sodium ion, muco-inositol is perceived as very \\"salty\\" in this situation. It contains a natraphore within its structure. Generic muco-inositol can also couple with the gluco-receptor of the \\"sweet\\" sensory neurons and be perceived as sweet by mammals, even though it is not a saccharide. While classed as a sugar-alcohol for historical reasons, muco-inositol is more properly described as a sweet- alcohol due its perception by the mammal as sweet. It contains two distinct glucophores, as well as two distinct natrophores, within its cyclic structure. Aliphatic alcohols do not contain any gustaphores in their pure state and are considered tasteless. However, many impurities (more than one part per million) have been present in the aliphatic alcohols used in laboratory experiments, resulting in their having been assigned a perceptual \\"taste.\\" Nomenclature Nomenclature is extremely important as it relates to muco- inositol. The utilization of this material in the neural system of the biological entity is totally dependent on the precise stereo-chemistry of this stereo-isomer. Unfortunately, the nomenclature has gone through a series of significant changes during the last thirty years. Only the literature subsequent to 1988 can be depended upon in this regard.NC-IUB (Moss, G. ed.) (1988) Numbering of atoms in myo-inositol http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html Muco-inositol (CAS 488-55-1) is a particular isomer of (and frequently confused with) the generic cyclohexane 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexol (CAS 87-89-8). This confusion should be avoided. The correct \\"chair\\" representation of muco-inositol is shown here. The numbering reflects the recommended 1988 numbering based on the fact that the isomer is typically phosphorylated at the hydroxyl group associated with the #1 carbon when used as the hydrated sodium receptor. Muco-inositol: note the diaxial or axial-trans-hydroxyl pairs involving #3 and #4 and #4 and #5 hydroxyl groups. It is quite difficult to represent the critical stereo- graphic features of muco-inositol without employing the three-dimensional representation provided by the Jmol 3D images in the Chembox at upper right. The reason is that the distances between pairs of specific oxygen atoms are critically important to its operation as the active portion of the sodium channel sensory receptor. The values calculated using the Jmol script on this page will be used in this article in place of the preferred but unavailable measured values of these distances. There are many inaccurate Jmol representations of muco-inositol present on the internet. Please use caution and verify the accuracy of any other Jmol script used. Detailed nomenclature Note, the O3 and O4 atoms are both associated with axial hydroxyl groups pointed in opposite direction and separated by the single carbon-carbon bond of C3 and C4. The angles between the carbon-hydroxyl group bonds and the carbon-carbon bond are nominally 109.5 degrees. The parameter of primary interest in gustation is the distance between the oxygen atoms of the pair O3 and O4 and the pair O4 and O5 in 3D space. This distance is defined as the d-value of the sensory receptor. This value cannot be obtained from the various Zig-Zag and Haworth representations commonly used in chemistry. Currently, the mean of the d-value of muco-inositol is between 3.3 Angstrom (0.33 nm) and 3.66 Angstrom (0.366 nm). The latter value is computed using the 3D structures found in the Jmol and Protein Data Bank libraries of Biochemistry. In both cases, another digit of precision is needed in the calculations to resolve this spread. Such precision is difficult to obtain in bond length measurements. The d-value of the O3 and O4 pair and the O4 and O5 pair are equal. The d-value between the two oxygen atoms of a pair of hydroxyl groups is slightly different than the distance described in most of the work of Shallenberger and colleaguesEggers, S. Acree, T. & Shallenberger, R. (2000) Sweetness chemoreception theory and sweetness transduction Food Chem vol 68(1), pp 45-49Shallenberger, R. & Acree, T. (1967) Molecular theory of sweet taste Nature vol 216, pp 480-482 for the saccharides during the 1970s. They initially described the slightly longer distance between the hydrogen of one group and the oxygen of the other. They were the first to describe the dual hydrogen (or London) bonds between the two oxygens of a pair and a similar pair of oxygen atoms of a stimulant as the potential selection mechanism (first of two steps in the transduction process) in sweet or G-path gustatory sensing. The more detailed definition and comparison is shown in the figure. Dual Coordinate Bond Arrangement used in gustation and olfaction. The upper frame shows the general concept. The lower box shows the actual ligand of the gustaphore used to select the sweet or G-path of the neural system. The caricature on the right shows the Newman Diagram for this ligand. The d-value and ligand changes when other paths are selected. A more complete discussion of this mechanism is available.Fulton, J. (2012) http://neuronresearch.net/taste/pdf/Why%20only%20four%20gustaphores.pdf Nomenclature of sodium ion in solution To address the role of PtdIns in the first step of the two-step Na-path sensory transduction process, the conformation of the sodium ion in solution must be appreciated. It cannot exist as a free ion in solution. Upon solvation, the total molecule is ionized and the sodium-ion is immediately hydrated, involving coordination chemistry, to form Na(H2O)n+ where n varies but is most commonly six. Uses Prior to the association of muco-inositol with the sensory receptors of gustation, the uses of generic inositol, and particularly the phosphatidyl inositols (PI) and phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIP) were mostily of interest to the formulating chemist. The phosphates are a family with specific members found via the (PIP) disambiguity page. As sensory receptor When muco-inositol is combined with a yet to be specifically defined phosphatidyl moiety, it is capable of forming the receptor for the sodium sensitive neural pathway (N or Na-path) in gustation. If it is phosphorylated at position #1 of the chair configuration shown at upper right, it presents two receptor sites (the hydroxyl pair at position #3 & #4, and the pair at position #4 & #5) to the fluid environment (mucosa) external to the sensory receptor neuron. At the same time, it suppresses the susceptibility of its two intrinsic sweet (or G-path) neural pathway receptors (the hydroxyl pair at positions #1 & #2 and at #6 & #1). In this instance, an organic bio-chemical is used to sense an inorganic ion (albeit a hydrated ion).

Early life Tang was born in Singapore. She moved to Perth, Western Australia, where she attended a girl's private Catholic school for two years. When she was 13 years-old, she moved with her family to Los Angeles, California. She started modeling for fashion catalogs and bikini calendars at the age of 19, while pursuing a course in marketing and business administration in college. Career Tang made softcore appearances in adult videos for Peach DVD, including the titles Asian Fever, Hotel Decadence, Sugar Daddy Wanted, and Peach Ultra Vixens: Asians. She appeared on Playboy TV multiple times (such as on Naked Sports & 7 Lives Xposed) and made appearances on other adult cable programs. Her mainstream film appearances include uncredited roles in Rush Hour 2 (2001), Cradle 2 the Grave and The Fast and the Furious (also 2001). Tang started her own website (FeliciaTang.com) in 2002. The site featured erotic material such as nude images, webcam, and film stills. Tang blogged and chatted with members of the site, cultivating a friendly atmosphere with her readers. A model who worked with Tang described her as \\"a bright, bubbly, kind, beautiful woman.\\" In 2003, she appeared in an erotic online video with Singapore-born television personality Tila Tequila. The video featured the two nude models fondling each other in a swimming pool. Tang closed the website in October 2008 and announced that she was retiring from modeling to pursue a career in real estate. All of the content on her website went offline in 2008. Tang was a competitor on a pay-per-view strip poker TV tournament hosted by Carmen Electra. Death In April 2009, she met Brian Lee Randone in Las Vegas. He was a former pastor and reality show contestant (on The Sexiest Bachelor In America in 2000), and they started dating. They had been living together for four months when Tang was found dead on September 11 at their house. Randone was charged with murder and torture and held for $2 million in bail. Following her death, Tang's family released a statement reading: \\"Felicia loved life and lived it to its fullest. However, she was more than just a public figure. Felicia was above all a human being, a daughter, a sister, a friend to many who continue to love and honor her, as much in life and in her passing.\\" Randone's trial began on November 16, 2011. The medical examiner stated that Tang was found with 320 wounds from blunt force trauma (not including bruises) and with high doses of the drug GHB in her system, together with trace amounts of cocaine. A witness testified that Tang had been a regular user of GHB for years, and that she had also used cocaine and/or crystal methamphetamine. The prosecution argued that Tang was forcibly smothered, while the defense argued that she died from a GHB overdose and that the wounds were caused by falls and seizures related to GHB consumption. On December 9, 2011, Randone was found not guilty on both charges.BREAKING: Brian Randone not guilty in murder trial of adult actress girlfriend , 12/09/2011 The trial attracted significant media attention, with the case dubbed \\"the preacher and the porn star\\", and has had further media coverage in subsequent years.

He was a member of the first Australian cricket team to tour England in 1868 and was one of the most well-known Aborigines of the nineteenth century. Early life Dick- a-Dick was born in the area around what is now Nhill, Victoria, the eldest son of Wotjobaluk Chief Balrootan.The Horsham Times, \\"The discovery of Nhill\\", 2 June 1944, p. 4. He later claimed that, aged about ten, he was present at the European discovery of Nhill by explorers Dugald MacPherson and George Belcher in 1844. Aboriginal tracker Living at Mt Elgin station in the Wimmera, Dick-a-Dick first gained notability as a talented tracker, someone who could read the land well enough to find and follow the tracks of people or animals. On Friday, 12 August 1864, three white children, Isaac Cooper, Jane Cooper and Frank Duff, went missing in the Mallee scrub of the Wimmera near Natimuk on the edge of the Little Desert and although their tracks were found the following day, a thunderstorm erupted soon after and destroyed the tracks. The official search was cancelled soon after the storm and newspapers reported the children as dead. On Thursday, 18 August, a neighbour of the Duff's suggested asking Dick-a-Dick and other Wotjobaluk trackers for assistance and the parents, who had not given up hope of finding their children, readily agreed. Dick-a-Dick took two other Wotjobaluk men, Jerry and Fred, with him and within hours had rediscovered the children's trail and hours later had found the children near death.Munro, p. 55. Dick-a-Dick was lauded a hero and subsequently called King Richard.Broome (2005), p. 151.Pierce, p. 22. He and his tracker colleagues received a reward of ¬£15 between them, of which ¬£5 they could spend in whatever way they wished, while the remainder was given to their white employer to ensure it was not wasted. Sportsman Dick-a-Dick was renowned for his skill in traditional weapons including the use of a waddy and shield. His star act was to challenge men to hit him with cricket ball thrown from 15 paces. Even when four balls were thrown at the same time, he was apparently only ever hit once, but claimed he was not ready at the time. He also always won the backwards sprint.Broome (2001), pp. 73‚Äì74. He protected his body and head with the shield and his legs with the waddy and would slowly move towards the men and suddenly yell, frightening everyone. A replica of Dick-a-Dick's club is held at the Lord's Cricket Ground museum.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 68. Referred to as \\"a famous athlete with a good running and long jumping record\\"Old 'Un, \\"An Old Time Team of Darkies\\", Euroa Advertiser, 2 April 1897, p. 3. \\"He was a fine strapping, handsome fellow, and must have had an eye like a hawk to escape the flying cricket balls as he did invariably. He would glance to leg with his shield, play in the slips with his leongile, and avoid the other two balls by leaping in the air, straddling his legs, or twisting his body like lightning, this all done at once and as quick as thought.\\" While in Melbourne, the Aboriginal cricketers were introduced to Lawn bowls. It was reported that Dick-a-Dick, along with Tarpot and Jellico, \\"impressed with their skill at the game.\\"Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 34. Dick-a- Dick also threw a cricket ball Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 38. in Australia, and matched that distance in England, and which was only bettered by W.G. Grace. He hurled a spear Harcourt & Delaney, p. 66. and won a high jump competition, clearing ,Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 39. gaining appreciation for his smooth jumping style. While Cuzens was usually the fastest runner of the group, Dick- a-Dick did win a 100-yard race against all-comers in Nottingham, as well as a 150-yard hurdle race, an excellent result considering he fell while attempting to clear a hurdle.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 69. Cricketer The Aboriginal team at the MCG in December 1866. Dick-a-Dick is standing at the far right While Dick-a-Dick's skill as a cricketer was less than his other sporting endeavours, he was chosen in the Aboriginal cricket team that played matches in Victoria and New South Wales and toured England. The team uniform was white trousers, red shirts with diagonal blue sashes, blue belts and neckties, while each cricketer was given a different coloured cap; Dick-a-Dick's was yellow.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 43. While on the tour, the daughter of the Aboriginal team's manager William Hayman wrote that Dick-a-Dick had fallen in love with a local white woman, who was reported to have agreed to marry him, but Hayman opposed the marriage and forced Dick-a-Dick to continue the tour. Referred to as \\"amiable and curious\\", Dick-a-Dick had a friendly disposition and was well-liked, with Charles Lawrence years later remembering him with real affection.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 46. Post-England tour After returning from the cricket tour of England, his health deteriorated and he travelled back to his traditional country and the Ebenezer Mission. He was thought to have worked as a drover and fencer along the Murray River. White locals recognised Dick-a-Dick as a leader and elder, with one settler family recalling that he was the traditional owner of the MacKenzie Springs and Bill's Gully hunting grounds of the Wimmera,Coutts et al. p. 12. and Dick-a- Dick was presented with an inscribed king plate by local European authorities.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 77. Dick-a-Dick was known by a number of names throughout his life. In addition to his birth name, Djungadjinganook, and its spelling variants Jumgumjenanuke and Jungunjinuke, he was also known as King Billy, King Dick and Kennedy (in honour of an Edenhope policeman he admired). His descendants adopted Kennedy as their surname. He died at the mission on 3 September 1870. While in Warrnambool in 1867, Dick-a-Dick was introduced to Christianity by Lawrence and appeared strongly affected by the life of Jesus.Harcourt & Mulvaney, pp. 44-45. He was not worried about the trip to England as he knew the captain had prayed for a safe arrival.Harcourt & Mulvaney, p. 49. Just before his death, he confessed his faith in Christianity and was baptised on 30 July 1870.Mallett, pp. 166‚Äì167. Minutes before his death, Dick-a-Dick claimed to have seen the face of Jesus. Questions about Dick-a-Dick's life There are conflicting reports of the age of Dick-a-Dick and his date and place of death. While some sources give his date of death as 3 September 1870, there are several others which have him alive after this date. For example, a newspaper report from 1934 states that Dick-a-Dick was \\"about 50 years of age\\" when he was interviewed about his recollection of his tribe's meeting with European explorers MacPherson and Belcher in 1844. If that estimate was correct, it would mean the interview had taken place in the 1880s. Additionally, in Cricket Walkabout, their book on the 1868 tour, Rex Harcourt and John Mulvaney state that he \\"probably died about the mid-1890s\\". Legacy A book based on Dick-a-Dick's rescue of the Duff children, Lost in the Bush, was published and remained on the Victorian school curriculum for many years. A plaque commemorating the role Dick-a-Dick played in the rescue of the children was erected near Mitre Rock, Nhill, Victoria. Dick-a-Dick's great-grandson William John Kennedy was a leading activist for Australian Aboriginal causes who was named \\"Male Elder of the Year\\" at the 2003 National NAIDOC Week Awards.

The Lippe-Weissenfeld branch split from the non-ruling comital branch of Lippe-Biesterfeld in 1734. (However, in 1905, the Lippe- Biesterfeld branch inherited the throne of Lippe, with Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe reigning until the German revolution of 1918). Another side branch of the House of Lippe was the House of Schaumburg-Lippe, which from 1647 ruled the county, and from 1807, principality of Schaumburg-Lippe until 1918.  Counts  Lippe-Weissenfeld is the name of a cadet branch of the formerly ruling House of Lippe. The branch split from the branch Lippe-Biesterfeld when Ferdinand I, count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, received Weissenfeld manor house in the forest near Schieder-Schwalenberg as his seat in 1734. Both, Biesterfeld and Weissenfeld were so-called paragiums (non-sovereign estates of a cadet- branch) within the County of Lippe, the later Principality of Lippe which existed until 1918. The County of Schwalenberg was inherited by the Counts of Lippe in 1365, and the estates of Biesterfeld and Weissenfeld were parts of it. Simon VII, Count of Lippe begat a younger son, Count Jobst Hermann (1625-1678) who founded the line of Counts of Lippe-Biesterfeld, and whose grandson, Count Ferdinand founded a cadet (junior) branch of the family that became Counts of Lippe-Weissenfeld.  Princes  The brothers count Ferdinand (1772‚Äì1846) and count Christian (1777‚Äì1859) founded two branches of the line of Lippe-Weissenfeld. On 24 February 1916 the members of the elder branch, namely the family of Count Klemens zur Lippe-Weissenfeld (1860-1920) and his legitimate descendants, were granted the title of Prince/Princess with the style of Serene Highness. On 9 November 1918, all other legitimate cadet male/female members of the younger Lippe-Weissenfeld branch were also upgraded from the title of Count/Countess with the style Illustrious Highness and granted the title of Prince/Princess with the style of Serene Highness by Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe.

Towards the end of the 18th century, the family inherited considerable estates in the Electorate of Saxony, and moved there. Friedrich Ludwig, 2nd Count of Lippe-Weissenfeld (1737-1791), received the lordship of Baruth (including the estates of Rackel and Buchwalde) from his wife's family, the counts von Gersdorff, in 1797, and later also acquired the smaller estates of Dauban and Sornitz. (Baruth bei Bautzen must be distinguished from Baruth/Mark, a lordship of the counts and princes of Solms- Baruth). His elder son Ferdinand (1773-1846) inherited the Baruth lordship, while the latter's younger half-brother Christian (1777‚Äì1859) founded the younger line and received the estate of Teichnitz near Bautzen from the counts von Hohenthal, the family of his mother as well as of his wife. Later some smaller estates such as Lubachau, Gersdorf and D√∂berkitz were added. His grandson Clemens, 1st Prince of Lippe-Wei√üenfeld (1860‚Äì1920), acquired Schloss Proschwitz near Meissen by marriage to Baroness Friederike von Carlowitz in 1910. All properties were expropriated in the Soviet occupation zone in 1945. After the German reunification of 1990, Prince Georg of Lippe-Weissenfeld, a younger son of Christian, 4th Prince of Lippe-Weissenfeld, re-purchased the estate and castle of Proschwitz and established the renowned wine estate Prinz zur Lippe. Besides the wine production, he opens the castle for concerts, balls, banquets, conferences and weddings. In 1895 Count Egmont zur Lippe- Weissenfeld (1841-1896) bought Castle Pfaffst√§tt in Austria. After his death a year later in 1896 his family continued to occupy the castle until 1909 when they sold it to Count Adolf von Peckenzell. Egmont's younger son, Prince Alfred zur Lippe-Weissenfeld (1881-1960), by virtue of marriage to Countess Anna von Go√´ss (1895-1972) came in possession of Castle Alt-Wartenburg, where his son Prince Egmont of Lippe-Weissenfeld spent his youth and where his sisters, princesses Karola, Sophia and Theodora were born.

Career After moving to the United States in 1998, Liang began performing in her own one woman show, Liang Acrobatic & Comedy Show. She toured the states with her on stage partner Bill Patti as the MC and comedian. Liang gained national exposure in 2000 when she was cast in a Justin Timberlake \\"N'SYNC\\" video. That video was shown on HBO as part of \\"N'SYNC'S live concert from New York's Madison Square Garden. Liang was also featured in 2003 on Fox TV's 30 Seconds to Fame where she placed third in the competition. She also was asked to appear on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon where she performed and was saluted as a young star of tomorrow in 2004. Liang has made guests appearances on the syndicated Daily Buzz TV show (2004), Sabado Gigante on Univision (2006) and on NBC's Today Show (2007). Liang performed in the second season of NBC's America's Got Talent (2007). In episode 1, (June 12, 2007) she balanced eight spinning plates on bamboo sticks throughout her act while doing various acrobatic maneuvers, including splits and head stands. Piers Morgan buzzed her to see whether she would react, but she did not drop any plates during her performance. Judges Morgan, Sharon Osbourne and David Hasselhoff rewarded her with a trip to the Las Vegas Callbacks episode (7/10/07). Today, Liang continues touring the U.S. performing in her one-woman show for a wide range of venues including colleges, corporations, festivals, casinos, and NBA/NCAA halftime shows.

It is known for featuring an ancient site of 37 Slavic kurgans (burial mounds) 4‚Äì10 metres high. Kleczan√≥w, Oficjalny Serwis Gminy Obraz√≥w The complex is surrounded by agricultural fields, and is unique in the whole region. The first burials are believed to have started in the Kleczan√≥w woods in the late Stone Age and continued into the 10th and 11th centuries. The prehistoric cemetery was discovered by Polish archeologists in the 1990s. In pagan times the site could have been a Slavic sacred wood (gaj, Proto-Slavic *gaj—å 'wood, thicket, bush, grove', see: Slavic mythology, sacred grove), a place where people worshipped and used to bury their relatives. Although the whole surrounding landscape was transformed into farmland, the Kleczan√≥w Woods survived untouched. For 1,000 years the religious community of Kleczan√≥w used to celebrate Pentecost feasts and Whitsun festival there. The spring season, lasting from March till June, was traditionally devoted by Slavs to rebirth ceremonies and communication with dead ancestors (as well as autumn time, conf. Halloween among Germanic people). In early Christian period this pagan habit blended with Catholic feasts.

It is one of only a few beef cattle breeds developed in Canada. The latter half of the breed's name derives from the characteristic white, black and grey spots and patches of color that it is known for. The Canadian Speckle Park is one of the newest cattle breeds, having been officially recognized by the Canadian government in 2006. A breed association was formed in 1985, and exports of Canadian Speckle Park to the U.S, Australia and New Zealand have occurred. Work on breeding the Canadian Speckle Park began in the 1950s with the crossing of a roan Shorthorn heifer to a Black Angus bull. The spotting became a dominant trait in the offspring, and the beginnings of a new breed emerged. Descended solely from British beef breeds, it is naturally polled and inherits many of the characteristics of popular cattle like the Angus. Breed history Canadian Speckle Park is a truly Canadian breed developed from three British breeds: Teeswater Shorthorn, Aberdeen Angus, and a British white. Mary Lindsay began producing speckled cattle when she crossed a red roan cow and a bull with a white park pattern. These offspring were always speckled, and in 1959, Lindsay sold a heifer to Bill and Eillen Lamont of Saskatchewan, who began using speckled cows in their herd. When crossed with Black Angus bulls, these cows produced offspring with a speckled pattern. These offspring were successful beef cattle, and the next step was to develop this handful of cattle into a recognized breed. In 1985, representatives of nine herds gathered together to form the Speckle Park Breeders Association. Created with the intent to develop a new breed, this association was later renamed The Canadian Speckle Park Association. In 1993, the association was incorporated under the Canadian Animal Pedigree Act so a breed could be developed, and in 1995 the first bylaws were passed. Finally, in 2006, Canadian Speckle Park was granted full breed status. Characteristics Canadian Speckle Park is so named because of the colour pattern of the cattle. Speckled refers to the spots on the rear quarters and across the body, and park refers to the colour around the ears, eyes, muzzle, lower legs and teats. Except for the solid colour pattern, Canadian Speckle Park have white lines on their backs and underbellies. The classic speckle pattern contains more coloured spots around the hips and shoulders, with a generally black or black roan face. White with small black spots is characteristic of the leopard pattern. Classic speckle and leopard patterns are genetically the same, and result from the combination of the white park gene and the solid gene.

The coup itself was bloodless, and was preceded by social unrest and political conflict between the ruling leftist Pakistan Peoples Party government of Bhutto, and the right-wing Islamist opposition Pakistan National Alliance which accused Bhutto of rigging the 1977 general elections. In announcing the coup, Zia promised \\"free and fair elections\\" within 90 days, but these were repeatedly postponed on the excuse of accountability and it was not until 1985 that (\\"party-less\\") general elections were held. Zia himself stayed in power for eleven years until his death in a plane crash. The coup was a watershed event in the Cold War and in the history of the country. The coup took place nearly six years after the 1971 war with India which ended with the secession of East Pakistan as Bangladesh. The period following the coup saw the \\"Islamisation of Pakistan\\" and Pakistan's involvement with the Afghan mujahideen (funded by US and Saudi Arabia) in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Background The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) came in power after the general elections held in 1970. The power was given to PPP after the devastating war with India which ended with the secession of East-Pakistan. Proponents of social democracy, left-wing philosophy, and socialist orientation was encouraged by the government and such ideas slowly entered in the ordinary lives of the people. According to some authors and historians some influential groups were not ready to accept the PPP's taking power in 1971. In 1972‚Äì74, the intelligence community had thwarted more than one attempt by the military officers to oust the civilian PPP government; all cases were heard by JAG legal branch of the Pakistan military. In 1976, Prime Minister Bhutto forcefully retired seven army generals to promote Lieutenant-General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to four star rank and subsequently appointment as chief of army staff and General Muhammad Shariff as chairman joint chiefs. Reciprocating in the same period, General Zia invited Bhutto of becoming first and only civilian Colonel Commandant of the Armoured Corps. 1977 general elections and political crises In 1976, nine religious and conservative parties formed a common platform, called Pakistan National Alliance (PNA). In January 1977, Prime Minister Bhutto immediately started campaigning after called for new general elections. The PNA was united behind religious slogans and a right-wing political agenda. The PPP, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of social justice in agriculture and industry. Despite large turnouts at PNA campaign events and the establishment on PNA's circle, the results of the general elections showed the Pakistan Peoples Party winning 155 out of 200 seats in the National Assembly and the PNA winning only 36. Bhutto therefore gained a supermajority in the Parliament. The PNA leadership was astonished when the results were announced by the Election Commission (EC) and prudently refused to accept the results and accused the Government of systematic rigging. According to \\"The Story of Pakistan\\", > At many places, particularly where the PNA candidates were strong, the > polling was alleged to have been blocked for hours. There were also reports > that PPP armed personnel in police uniform removed ballot boxes. Marked > ballot papers were also found on the streets in Karachi and Lahore. Rumors > quickly circulated that the results in key constituencies were issued > directly from the Prime Minister's office. According to author Ian Talbot, \\"The reality seems to be that a certain PPP victory was inflated by malpractice committed by local officials, which may have affected 30‚Äì40 seats.\\" The PNA immediately called for street boycott and demanded resignation of Prime Minister Bhutto. The PNA used mosques to agitate the masses and caused severe civil unrests. At least 200 people were killed in the clashes between security forces and demonstrators. Zia had already taken care of the Bhutto Loyalists, and had put to military trial one of the biggest names in Pakistan Army history ; General Tajammul Hussain Malik war hero 1965 & 1971 to show Bhutto his loyalty. This did, however decrease his support within the army and it is believed several factions of the army that sided with Gen. Tajammul later caused Gen Zia's death. Bhutto responded with the use of Federal Security Force (FSF) and Police to control the situation as many activists of PNA were imprisoned. One leader of the PNA secretly wrote a letter to chiefs of staff of armed forces and chairman joint chiefs to intervene to end the crises; thus inviting armed forces to enforce martial law. In 1977, one official of the Military Intelligence (MI) had persuaded Prime Minister Bhutto that martial law was imminent, and to speed up the negotiations with the PNA. The PPP realised the seriousness of the crises and political negotiations were started in June 1977. The PPP accepted almost all demands of the PNA and the stage was set for a compromise. The negotiations were stalled when Bhutto took the lengthy tour of Middle East countries and the PNA termed his tour as dilatory tactics. Furthermore, there was an impression created in the print media that negotiations were falling apart. After the letter reached to the chiefs of staff of armed forces and chairman joint chiefs, there was a fury of meeting of inter-services to discuss the situation. When Bhutto returned to the country and in spite of the agreement was about to sign with the PNA. The military staged a coup against Bhutto to end the political crises. Coup Operation Fair Play was the code name for the military coup d'√©tat conducted on 5 July 1977 by Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The pretext for the coup was the failure of the ruling PPP and the opposition PNA to reach an agreement regarding fresh elections. The code name Fair Play was intended to portray the coup as the benign intervention of an impartial referee to uphold respect for the rules and ensure free and fair elections. In announcing the coup, Zia promised \\"free and fair elections\\" within 90 days. He arrested Bhutto and his ministers, as well as other leaders of both the PPP and the PNA. He dissolved the National Assembly of Pakistan and all provincial assemblies, suspended the Constitution, and imposed martial law. A four-member Military Council, made up of Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq as Chief Martial Law Administrator, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the Chiefs of the Navy and the Air Force, took over government operations in the country.: \\"Mr Fazal Elahi Chaudhry has very kindly consented to continue to discharge his duties as President of Pakistan ... To assist him in the discharge of his national duties, a four-member Military Council has been formed. The Council consists of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chiefs of Staff of the Army [Zia], Navy, and Air Force. I will discharge the duties of the Chief Martial Law Administrator.\\" Bhutto and the PPP was persecuted on the charges of murder of political opponents. Supreme Court The Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of Pakistan Anwar-ul-Haq legitimatised the military response after issuing the Doctrine of necessity orders. On 24 October 1977, the Supreme Court began the trial against Bhutto on charges of \\"conspiracy to murder\\" Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri. In 1977, the Supreme Court found Bhutto guilty of murder charges and condemned him to death. Despite appeals of clemency sent by many nations, the government upheld the Supreme Court verdict and followed the Supreme Court orders when Bhutto was hanged in 1979. Soviet Union and United States When the martial law took place, the whole world was quiet, and regional countries (such as India and China) did not issue any statements. Only two countries issued the statements over this issue. The USSR did not welcome the martial law and Bhutto's subsequent execution. The USSR harshly criticised the coup and Leonid Brezhnev condemned Bhutto's execution as an act out of \\"purely humane motives\\". The US played an ambiguous role instead with many charging that the martial law was imposed with the willingness and \\"tacit\\" approval of the US and the CIA's involvement. When allegations were levelled against the US by Pakistani historians and scholars, US officials reacted angrily and held Bhutto responsible for his act. Despite US denial, many authors, and the PPP's intellectuals themselves, held the US responsible and suspected the US of playing a \\"hidden noble role\\" behind the coup. In 1998, Benazir Bhutto and the PPP publicly announced their belief in the electronic media that Zulfikar Bhutto was \\"sent to the gallows at the instance of the superpower for pursuing the nuclear capability [of Pakistan].\\" Aftermath Before the third martial law in 1977, Pakistan had been under martial law for nearly 13 years, and saw the wars with India which led to the secession of East Pakistan. The Martial law endured the toxic legacies of General Zia-ul-Haq's eleven years of authoritarian rule. It was marked by numerous human rights violations. A weak insurgent movement against General Zia's government was maintained inside the country by elements sympathetic to the former Bhutto government, but was met with great hostility from the United States and General Zia. The martial law of 1977 ended in 1988 with the death of President Zia-ul-Haq and many other key military administrators in the government. Following this event, the country returned to democracy and the PPP again came in power. In 1999, martial law was again imposed against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the armed forces, resulting in General Pervez Musharraf coming to power for nine years.

He lives in Cambridge, England where he created (and runs) the Cambridge Freecycle group, one of the largest in Europe.  Early involvement in MUDS  While at the University of Leeds, he took over management of MUD1 at Essex University in 1987. MUD1 was the first online role playing world, played by text through X.25/PSS and later Telnet. After its shutdown he carried on running MIST, another early virtual world, until he closed that down in 1991. Famous then simply as Lorry, he wrote the seminal guide for MUD management \\"Confessions of an Arch-Wizard\\". Years later he wrote a few updates to this explaining how it all worked in practice. In 1988 he took over the AberMUD project for a year, running a standard distribution of the game at Southampton University, Leeds University and the IBM PC Users Group. He also managed a VAX based mud at St David's University College, Lampeter. Lawrie was the first person to send out the AberMUD source code to Vijay Subramaniam thus starting the proliferation of MUDs throughout the world.  IRC  Lawrie has been involved in IRC (Internet Relay Chat) since it first left Finland and had his first IRC Operator on Vijay Subramaniam's IRC Server in 1989. Since then he has been heavily involved in IRC both in the UK and worldwide and was central in creating Ircnet when the European servers split away from EFnet.  Public access systems  Michael Lawrie is an ardent supporter of free, public-access systems and servers and is deeply rooted in the history of such services and in the development and opening up of the internet in the UK. He was one of the management team of Edinburgh University's Tardis Project http://lorry.org/Docs/tardis-paper-1991.pdf in 1987 and later managed HICOM, a joint project between the British Computer Society, the British Psychological Society, Digital Equipment Corporation and British Telecom into HCI and CSCW. HICOM's VMS system was open to anybody who wanted an account and as well as being famous for being the only machine that the hacker Kevin Mitnick ever had a legitimate account on. It was also the first public access Internet Service Provider in the UK.  Career  In his non-online life Michael Lawrie started off as systems and security manager and computer misuse expert and is now a Commercial Security Consultant and threat assessment specialist. He has worked for a number of large companies and headed up the Commercial Security team at British Telecom.  Historical preservation  He is the owner of a huge collection of historical computers, calculators, peripherals, electronic games, and more than a tonne of technical documentation.

OUAS is one of fifteen University Air Squadrons that are spread out across Great Britain and it recruits from the universities at Oxford (Oxford University and Oxford Brookes) and Reading University. Present day University Air Squadrons offer basic flying training and adventure training to undergraduates and graduates and encourage members to take up a career as an officer in one of the branches of the Royal Air Force. Some members of OUAS hold the title of Officer Cadet, which carries the privileges, but not the rank, of a commissioned officer, while some other members are also granted commissions in the RAF Volunteer Reserve, with the rank of Acting Pilot Officer. Officer Cadets are required to attend a minimum of one training night a week during full term, usually a lecture by a guest speaker on an aspect of the Royal Air Force or another military unit. They are also expected to take part in two weeks of continuous training during the Long Vacation. There are also camps during all university vacations for sports, flying and adventure training. OUAS is based at RAF Benson alongside its daughter unit 6 Air Experience Flight, and is equipped with the Grob Tutor T1.Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation: RAF Volunteer Reserve Units at rafweb.org Each officer cadet is offered a Summer Vacation Attachment of one week at another RAF base, seconded to an active regular unit. History The Squadron was founded on 11 October 1925 (the second oldest after Cambridge University Air Squadron) and initially had 24 students. The first summer camps were based at RAF Manston from 1925 up to 1931. The squadron disbanded just before the Second World War broke out in September 1939 but then was reformed in September 1940 to provide flying training to students. OUAS was an important source of pilots in the lead up to the Battle of Britain. As members of the RAFVR, cadets were called up for active service before completing their degrees. Having first been based at Upper Heyford, then from 1932 at Abingdon, OUAS operated from Bicester Airfield until 1975, when it returned to Abingdon. Its present base is at RAF Benson where it has been since 1992. In June 1951 Aidan Crawley the then Under-Secretary of Air presented the squadron its new badge to the Vice- Chancellor Dr J.Lowe (Dean of Christ Church, Oxford just before the students headed for its annual camp. Notable past members include Leonard Cheshire, Dinghy Young, Julian Amery, Lord Lyell VC, and the actors Richard Burton, Robert Hardy and Warren Mitchell. The 2012 RAF Aerobatic Display Team 'Red Arrows' Synchro Leader, Flt Lt Ben Plank, is also a former member. Having originally been open only to members of the University of Oxford, in 1986 the Squadron was opened to members from the Oxford Polytechnic, which became Oxford Brookes University in 1993 and the University of Reading.

The squadron was a civilian organization with a blazer and squadron tie as the only uniform. 1925 On 11 October a squadron was formed at Oxford with the object of attracting the first candidates for commissions to the Royal Air Force, the Royal Air Force Reserve and the Auxiliary Air Force, to simulate interest in air matters generally and to maintain liaison with the university. Wing Commander H R Raikes, Sub Rector of Exeter College, was appointed as Commanding Officer and Chief Instructor with Squadron Leader A G Weir to help him. Courses of practical instruction were provided during term time but actual flying was only practiced in the long vacation. An entrance fee of only ¬£1 was charged and the total cost of setting up the squadron was ¬£4000. The first headquarters was built at Manor Road which remained the HQ for many years. 1926 The success of the squadron was guaranteed by the enthusiasm with the first members embarked on their ground instruction on the various types of engines, instruments and accessories under the guidance of Sgt J B Acres and Sgt T I Devison. In July the squadron set off for its first annual camp at RAF Manston where the members were flown in Avro 504 loaned, with instructions by the air force. These early Avros were the 504k model with rotary engine which were reported to cover the pilot with castor oil and smell so badly that many a novice pilot felt very sick. It is obvious from early flying program that squadron members were very keen enough to be in the air by 6 am flew until 1pm and then took part in sporting activities until dinner. The squadron achieved a total of 205 hours in the camp period. The camp was judged to be a great success not only with the pilots but with the station and locals as well; the annual camp was held at Manston for a few more years. 1927 There had been so much interest in flying shown by undergraduates that when an aircraft landed on the Ferry Hinksey Road in Oxford and offered joy rides the undergraduates flocked out. Only a few were able to fly before the University authorities intervened and banned any further flying by undergraduates. Members of the UAS, however, were allowed to fly with the squadron provided their experiences were restricted to dual flying out of term time. It was not until several years later that solo flying was eventually permitted during term time. The universities were afraid that undergraduates were not taking aviation seriously and indeed one of the reasons for banning flights over the city of Oxford was that the embryo pilots might indulge in some 'dangerous aerial gymnastics'. Towards the end of the year, the authorities allowed dual flying in term time for members of the squadron and 4 Avro 504N aircraft were accordingly installed at Upper Heyford for their use. Membership had now risen to 75 members and some 400 hours had been flown in the year. The annual camp was held again at Manston and on average each member was receiving about 1.5 hours flying per day interspersed with lectures on rigging, engines and airmanship. Improvements over the camp of the previous year were reported, one of which was the Hucks starter. this device stood on a movable base - Ford Model T and then driven out to an aircraft awaiting to be started up. The aircraft flown in 1927 was the Avro 504N's, with the Lynx engine, the radial engine which was a great improvement on the model of the previous year. The squadron also had the use of a single Bristol F.2 Fighter. In these early days at camp there were occasional accidents including a collision on the ground between an Avro and a Vickers Virginia but the general tone of the reports was that such misfortunes were inevitable and it was \\"fortunate that none of the undergraduates was really hurt\\". At the end of the year 2 Napier engines were presented to the Squadron by H T Vance and Sir Harry Britten, directors of Napiers, for instructional purposes. 1928 In January Wing Commander Garrod took over as Chief Instructor, at the half way point of his distinguished service career. Shortly afterwards, Miss Round was engaged as squadron secretary, a post she was to hold for 34 years. Already around this time friendly rivalry with Cambridge University Air Squadron was starting with plans of an air navigation contest and talk of \\"Aerial Blues\\" and the athletic ability of the squadron was formidable, including such names as Hugh Edwards (rower), the oarsmen, and his brother E C Edwards who won the King's Cup when he just left the squadron. Other early members were W Rathbone, Douglas Dodds- Parker, later Member of Parliament, and P Yorke who was so taken with first solo flight at the 1927 camp that he refused to land. When he eventually alighted mechanics were sent out to seize the wing-tips of his aircraft but he took off again. The squadron was well established in its 'hangar' headquarters at Manor Road, Oxford where ground instruction was given on 2 aeroplanes and 6 engines which members dismantled and put together again. 1929 The squadron was recognized by the university as a 'permanent institution' thus putting it on an equal footing with the Officers' Training Corps, by approving a statue to add the name of the Commanding Officer of the squadron as a member of the Delegacy of Military Instruction (DMI). Even more hours were flown at Manston during camp (1105) and the press were invited to visit. For the camp the squadron had 8 Lynx Avros, 2 Bristol Fighters (service type) and one Bristol Fighter dual control with slotted wing. Back in Oxford a new lecture hall adjoining the hangar was opened at Manor Road by Secretary of State for Air, Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson. The squadron had 10 Rhodes scholars on its strength, 2 Rugby Blues, a Rowing Blue and 2 Boxing Blues. Three members decided to make the RAF their permanent career and completed their initial training with distinction. 1930‚Äì31 These 2 years saw an increase in the number and variety of outside lectures who visited the squadron at Manor Road, Major Scott on handling of airships and Mr D R Pye on the development of aero engine. In 1931 the squadron went to RAF Eastchurch for the first time on what was described an 'annual holiday training'. Wing Commander R M Hill has now taken over the squadron which was conferred the privilege of bearing the university arms on the aircraft. 1932 The squadron visited Eastchurch again for summer camp and flew over 1300 hours, some of which were on the newly- introduced Armstrong Whitworth Atlas. This aircraft replaced the Bristol fighter as an advanced 2-seat trainer. However the year was really singled out by the move, in November from Upper Heyford to RAF Abingdon as the permanent flying base. The squadron aircraft were led in formation by the squadron commander Wing Commander Keith Park in an Atlas carrying as passenger the Vice-Chancellor, Rev F J Lys, who, at the age of 70, was reported to be reluctant to leave the machine. The squadron's 5 Avro Lynx followed behind. 1933‚Äì35 To give special incentive to squadron members to gain proficiency in flying John Siddeley, 1st Baron Kenilworth presented the squadron with a magnificent trophy to be won by the member who has judged to be the best all- round pilot, this trophy is still presented today. In the spring of 1934 the Avro Tutor was introduced by which time the squadron had trained some 240 pilots and flown 15,000 hours. At the end of 1934 with the expansion of the Air Force the established strength of the squadron was increased to allow those who were seeking permanent commission to join the squadron without restricting the number of ordinary members. These recruits would then go to a special course at RAF Cranwell after completing 70 hours flying with the air squadron. For summer camp in 1935 the squadron again went to Eastchurch under the command of Wing Commander C N Lowe. 1936‚Äì38 For the 1936 camp at Eastchurch the squadron had 3 Harts or 'service types' for flying the more advanced members. In the spring of 1937 Flight Lieutenant H J Fitzpatrick joined the staff as the first returning ex-member as instructor and adjutant. The squadron went to Ford, West Sussex for camp and accommodated for the first time in tents. With a total of 80 members, the squadron needed extra aircraft for the camp in 1938, again at Ford, and 3 Harts, 2 Hinds, 1 Audax and 14 Tutors were brought on strength. The extra flying had its penalties in incidents which seem curious nowadays; one Tutor was damaged while taxying because the student's goggles were blurred by rain, one Hart burst a tyre on landing because of flints on the airfield and the aircraft were saved from wind damage on one blustery day by parking Military Transport vehicles in front of them to form a wind break. During the camp members visited the aircraft carrier HMS Courageous (50) at sea. 1939 In the year of the outbreak of war the squadron was more active than ever. Some of the senior members were sent to the RAFVR Flying School at Kidlington to gain flying experience on Harts during term time. The Annual Dinner was the largest so far with 300 people at present and was a great success. There were now familiar incidents of forced landings and an undershoot by a student 'trying to prolong his glide by pulling his nose up'. Camp was held at Lympne Airport just before the squadron closed down on 16 September on the outbreak of hostilities. The War Years 1940‚Äì45 1940 In September 1940 the squadron was re-opened to take in the short courses for ground training to the standard of the RAF Initial Training School \\"Wings\\" syllabus. About 100 members were taken in, under the commander of Squadron Leader H R A Edwards. 1941‚Äì45 The pattern of training on the squadron was similar throughout the war. Large courses of short duration were organized for the undergraduates to give them a grounding in many of the subjects they would need as RAF pilots. Up to 300 were eventually taken on each course of some 6 months duration. It was thought a good idea to give potential fighter pilots some practice at shooting in preparation for air to air combat and so a clay pigeon shoot was organized every Saturday. This grew to become a match against Cambridge UAS and eventually the squadron rented (for a nominal sum) Lord Hardcourt's shoot at Nuneham. In May 1943 the squadron marched through Oxford as part of the parade for the \\"Wings for Victory\\" Week and was contributing to the war effort by training ever increasing numbers on the short courses, even giving the potential aircrew practice dinghy drill in the Cherwell off the lawn of the squadron headquarters. The effort expended on training can well be imagined when it is realized that over 2000 members passed through the squadron during the war, these include famous people Richard Burton, Robert Hardy and Warren Mitchell.

Location  The Denali Fault is located in Alaska's Denali National Park and to the east. This National Park includes part of a massive mountain range more than 600 miles long. Along the Denali Fault, lateral and vertical offset movement is taking place. The steep north face of Denali, known as the Wickersham Wall, rises 15,000 feet from its base, and is a result of this relatively recent movement.  Effects  Alaska's network of faults is a result of tectonic activity; the Pacific Plate is actively subducting (sliding under) the North American Plate, and the Denali Fault is located on the boundary between the two plates. The fault's rate of displacement varies from 1 mm to 35 mm per year. It was the main fault along which the 2002 Denali earthquake occurred, which was measured as a magnitude of 7.9 Mw. During the afternoon of November 3, 2002, the water in Seattle's Lake Union suddenly began sloshing hard enough to knock houseboats off their moorings. Water in pools, ponds, and bayous as far away as Texas and Louisiana splashed for nearly half an hour. The earthquake began at 1:12 p.m. Alaska local time, and was centered approximately 135 kilometers (84 miles) south of Fairbanks and 283 kilometers (176 miles) north of Anchorage. Shaking at the epicenter lasted approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes, but in Fairbanks the duration of the earthquake was over 3 minutes. Originating on the previously unknown Susitna Glacier Fault, the earthquake shot eastward along the well-known Denali Fault at a speed of over 11,265 kilometers (7,000 miles) per hour before branching southeast onto the Totschunda Fault. The resulting surface rupture was approximately 336 kilometers (209 miles) long, and it cut through streams, divided forests, opened chasms in roads, and even generated fault traces visible across several glaciers. Because the earthquake released most of its energy on the sparsely populated eastern end of the fault, Alaska's major cities were spared serious damage.

Castellari.Severin Films DVD Case, 2009. Last accessed: September, 2009. It starred Frederick Stafford, Van Johnson and Francisco Rabal. Plot During the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, a team of German saboteurs assume the identities of dead British soldiers and are transported to England. Their first objective is to cripple British air defences by destroying radar stations. Though the identities and whereabouts of the saboteurs are unknown, a team of British soldiers is set up to track them down and abort their mission. While the Battle of Britain rages overhead, the final confrontation takes place as the German team are about to blow up the RAF Fighter Command control centre. Production When Enzo G. Castellari finished the film Kill Them All and Come Back Alone, he asked the producers what their next film would be. They replied a war epic about the Battle of Britain with the Harry Saltzman version yet to be released. Enzo thought that was a great idea but the producers had their sights on Alberto De Martino directing. The producers stipulated that stock footage of the actual Battle of Britain needed to be used in the film and that it should be used in a split-screen method. They asked Enzo if he would direct the special effects sequences and cut it with the stock footage using a split-screen method. Enzo had never heard of \\"split screen\\" so he was shown the American films The Thomas Crown Affair and The Boston Strangler. He shot the effects sequences and mixed it using a triple split screen method. An example is having a British plane shoot on the left side, having a German plane getting hit on the right side, and having stock footage in the middle. When shown this split-screen footage, the producers were so impressed they decided to have Enzo direct the entire picture. After this, Enzo sat down with a writing partner for a week to rewrite the overlong script to make it more action-oriented and less of a \\"soap opera\\".\\"A Conversation with Enzo Castellari and Quentin Tarantino Part 2\\", Severin Films DVD, 2009. Last accessed: September, 2009. The film is entirely fictional and historically inaccurate. For instance, the RAF never shot down 94 German planes in one day; London was never \\"blitzed\\" in one sortie by \\"1,000 planes\\"; and the RAF Control Centre was never attacked in any way. The director uses Messerschmitt Bf 109s (or near-replicas of them) as RAF \\"Hawker Hurricanes\\", and Supermarine Spitfires as Luftwaffe \\"Bf 109s\\". The fictional \\"bombers\\" that are supposed to be Heinkel He 111 are in reality CASA 2.111 similar planes built in Spain under licence.Eagles Over London (Hong Kong edition), Severin Films DVD, 2011(?). Last accessed: April 2011. Releases Simitar Entertainment released the film on VHS in 1994. Echo Bridge Home Entertainment also released the film on VHS in 2001. Severin released the film for the first time ever in America on Region 0 DVD and Blu-ray in 2009. The film was released for Region 2 on 7 June 2010. Severin release is uncut International version but it is few minutes shorter than original Italian. Reception In a contemporary review, The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the film \\"shows a glimmer of originality but it is sluggishly developed and peppered with desultory split-screen work\\" and \\"the action is efficiently mounted and apart from the appearance of some rather swarthy-looking British Tommies, wartime Britain looks slightly more authentic [...] than the film's many nationalities might have led one to expect.\\" In a retrospective review, Sight & Sound stated that \\"The idea of Nazi saboteurs disguised and wreaking havoc in England has been used in films from Ealing's Went the Day Well to The Eagle Has Landed, but those movies lacked the formal flamboyance that Castellari brings to his material.\\" The review concluded \\"It's Boy's Own stuff but it's carried off with such style that it never descends into kitsch.\\" Aftermath and influence Roughly thirty percent of the film Eagles Over London was cut into the macaroni combat film From Hell to Victory. Castellari said that he and his wife went to go see From Hell to Victory in theatres and it made him extremely upset that footage he shot was reused in another film.

Roseberry. 1966 He was flight engineer on the America (the third plane to fly non stop over the Atlantic Ocean), and was executive officer of Byrd's Second Antarctic Exploration 1933-35. Mount Noville and Noville Peninsula in Antarctica are named after him. Biography George Noville was born on April 24, 1890, in Cleveland, Ohio.US passport issued on 24 May 1920 He was the son of Otto J. Noville (1870‚Äì1936), a rich and well-known hat manufacturer.Bill Bryson (2013), One Summer: America, 1927, New York: Doubleday, Ch. [2], \\"June: The Babe\\", p. 178, . He was an officer in the United States Naval Reserve and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on December 17, 1927. Transatlantic flight In 1927, in a trimotor Fokker C-2 monoplane, named America he flew with Richard E. Byrd, Bernt Balchen, and Bert Acosta on their record-setting transatlantic flight. In 1927, Byrd decided to partner with Floyd Bennett (his co-pilot on the North Pole flight), and attempt to win the Orteig Prize which offered a $25,000 reward for the first non-stop flight from New York City to Paris. The plane chosen for this flight was a Fokker C-2 monoplane named America. George O. Noville was selected as the flight and fuel engineer. On April 20, 1927, during a test flight in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, the plane somersaulted when landing, breaking Byrd's arm and knocking him unconscious. The crash also injured Bennett and Noville required surgery for internal injuries. A fourth person on America, aircraft designer Anthony Fokker, was not injured.Famous American flyers By Chelsea Curtis Fraser. 1942. On Google Books Fokker later told Bennett that he should have refused to conduct the test flight with Byrd, Bennett, and Noville on board because there was no load in the rear of the plane. As a result, the plane was nose- heavy.East to the Dawn: The Life of Amelia Earhart By Susan Butler While Byrd and his crew regrouped from the accident, Charles Lindbergh won the Orteig Prize when he landed in Paris on May 21, 1927. According to The Big Aviation Book for Boys by Richard E. Byrd, Noville was one of the group who gathered to wish Lindbergh godspeed right before his historic flight. After several delays, Byrd's America took off for Paris on June 29, 1927 with Noville and two relief pilots, Bert Acosta and Bernt Balchen. The weather was terrible during the flight. Rain and strong winds made navigating near impossible. When America reached Paris after 40 hours, a heavy fog prevented it from landing. Byrd and his crew flew around Paris for about six hours waiting for the fog to lift. When it failed to do so, they flew west and landed in the ocean off of Ver-sur-Mar (later known as Omaha Beach in Normandy) without fatalities on July 1, 1927. Byrd, Acosta, Balchen and Noville ended up entering France in a rubber life raft as America sank after landing on the water. Popular Science magazine, August 1928, featured an extensive article with photos about this flight, \\"Dick Byrd‚Äî Adventurer.

Noville once again joined an adventure with Byrd, serving as executive officer of Byrd's Second Antarctic Exploration 1933-35.http://www.south-pole.com/p0000108.htm Personal life and death Noville was married four times. He married Violet E. Wade in 1914, and Lilian Grace MacMurchey in 1918. His third wife was identified as \\"Sigrid\\" in 1930. He married his fourth and final wife, Lucy Vacheron, in 1953.

Plot A monster stalks Los Angeles as a Bio-Engineered creature called a Syngenor (which stands for SYNthesized GENetic ORganism) takes refuge in the city's sewer system and then hits the streets at night in search of human spinal fluid.Retromedia DVD Case, 2007. Last accessed: September 2009. The only person who stands in the way of the creature's unstoppable killing spree is Ted Londergan, a former detective turned Private Investigator. When he is offered a job to look at the case by his former partner, several people on the police force doubt he can help solve it, as he is regarded by many to be a hotshot who has a loose temper. As time goes by, however, and the body count begins to mount, Ted is eventually brought in on the case. Both the police and the public become astonished by the fact that whoever is committing the murders possesses strength far beyond that of a human, such as actually being able to rip the doors off of cars. But when his newfound love interest Jennifer is nearly killed by the creature, he soon experiences a change of heart. After Jennifer is hospitalized after being attacked by the creature, a young woman named Sherry comes forward with information that could help solve the case. She explains to Ted that the fact that the young woman was missing spinal fluid may mean that it was drained by a creature known as a Syngenor that was being created at a lab where she worked. Ted goes to the lab to investigate, and finds the young woman in a state of panic. The two descend into the sewers, where they find the Syngenor's lair and its victims, whom it is harvesting for their spinal fluid. They are pursued by the creature as they flee back into the laboratory, and eventually Ted's former partner shows up and shoots the creature, causing it to fall back onto a press machine. Sherry then activates the press machine, crushing the creature and ending its reign of terror once and for all. Production Wanting to become a director, William Malone decided to make a monster movie because it was the type of film one could get a lot of production value for very little money. He also had experience with monster designs as he had previously worked as a designer at a Halloween mask factory so he knew he could design the monster himself. In order to raise enough money for the film Malone had to sell most of his personal belongings including his car and mortgaging his house. After raising enough money he began building and sculpting the monster suit. Being inspired by H.R. Giger's design from the film Alien, he took 3 months to build the suit. During this process Malone began casting the film and surprisingly he originally cast actor/pop star Rick Springfield in the lead role. Springfield however called up Malone the night before filming began saying he could not be in his film because he was going to miss too many acting classes. Malone then called up actor John Stinson whom he remembered from an improv class and begged him to be in the film, to which he agreed. Filming began in February 1979 and the shoot lasted a total of 4 weeks, a rather long time for a low-budget film. Lone Star Pictures, a Texas- based company, provided $40,000 for the budget and picked up worldwide distribution. After the premier, the first sale made by Lone Star Pictures made was to Malaysia for $90,000. They were already making a profit since the film only cost $74,000 to make. Release The film was first released by Lone Star Pictures International Inc. in all worldwide markets. The film was released on VHS by Media Home Entertainment in the 1980s. The film was released on DVD by Retromedia Entertainment in 2010. The title on the box art was changed to Scared to Death: Syngenor to show a connection to the film's 1990 sequel Syngenor.

Located by a loop at the end of the Franklin Street line of the Johnstown Passenger Railway Company,History of Trolleys in Johnstown, Pennsylvania the park was centered on an artificial lake that was surrounded by a racetrack (originally for harness racing, but other forms of racing were presented there over the years)Randy Whittle, Johnstown, Pennsylvania: a History, Volume 1 (History Press 2007) Throughout its existence, the park had picnic facilities.Ewa Morawska, Insecure Prosperity: Small-town Jews in Industrial America, 1890-1940 (Princeton University Press 1999) In 1905, the trolley park added amusement rides and attractions, including many that now are considered mainstays for such facilities. Locally popular, the park was beset with an instability of ownership until it was purchased by the City of Johnstown on 18 July 1922. Subsequently, the park's name was reverted to Roxbury Park. Eventually the mechanical rides and the racetrack disappeared from the grounds as Roxbury Park became a municipal park. History City founder Joseph Johns set aside land in the Point area of his embryonic town for use as public parks in 1800. Part of that land was Roxbury Park, which, by 1904, was a fenced-off amusement area that contained a horse racing track. When the Tri-County Driving Park Association defaulted on $40,000 in bonds, ownership of the land fell into the hands of stockbroker Frank Cresswell, who then quadrupled the rent on the Roxbury Race Track in 1904. Track manager John Pender responded by moving all of the track's scheduled races to nearby Westmont Race Track, ensuring that Roxbury would have a disastrous 1904 season. After Cresswell attempted to persuade Pender to return to Roxbury, Roxbury Park was subsequently leased to an association of roughly 100 businessmen and community leaders, including the incoming mayor Charles Young. The association invested an additional $50,000 for facilities, including a merry-go-round, a roller coaster, a crystal maze, a laughing gallery, an \\"upside-down house,\\" enhanced lakeside attractions (expanded lake and new boats), a vaudeville theater, and a grandstand that could seat 2000 people. Just before the grand opening on Memorial Day 1905, the park's name was changed to Luna Park. Luna Park's initial year, capped by the 1905 Inter- State Fair (attended by 25,000 people) was successful, as was the second season. The Panic of 1907, a severe recession that started in 1907 and continued into 1908, had a devastating effect on the park's attendance figures in both years (including the cancellation of the 1908 Inter-State Fair), forcing the transfer of Luna Park's lease from its original ownership to a new partnership led by local brewer Ernest Emmerling in 1908. The races, picnics, and boxing matches that predated the park's grand opening continued to be Luna Park's main draw as the amusement park industry was contracting as the region's (and America's) economic difficulties slowly subsided. While its popularity never returned to the heights it attained in 1905, the Johnstown Luna Park managed to outlast most of its contemporary namesakes despite uncertainty of ownership. A new \\"New Luna Park Amusement Company\\" was incorporated 5 April 1910. Capitalized at $10,000, the corporation was chartered for \\"buying, selling, or otherwise acquiring or disposing of real estate, for the purpose of erecting and operating thereon a scenic railway, dancing pavilion, and other amusements of a similar or cognate character, and generally to conduct the business of a recreation park.\\"Alphabetical List of Charters of Corporations Enrolled in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth During the Two Years Beginning June 1, 1909 and Ending May 31, 1911 (State of Pennsylvania 1911) In late 1914, the City of Johnstown was investigating the possibility of purchasing land for possible use as a municipal park. While the first attempt (to purchase of land in nearby Constable Hollow) fell through, the city acquired parkland in northern Somerset County (later called Carpenter Park) after overtures toward buying Luna Park and Elk Run Park. In 1917, the city stepped up its attempts to increase its parkland, but an offer for a larger tract in Constable Hollow (188 acres for $50,000) was narrowly turned down by the City Council as the dissenting members preferred buying the land occupied by Luna Park instead. After the 1918 purchase of Highland Park, Johnstown mayor Joe Cauffiel urged the purchase of Luna Park. He reiterated his position in his second inauguration address (January 1920). In 1921, trolley service to the park ended. On 18 July 1922, the City of Johnstown purchased Luna Park, its land, and an additional tract in Upper Yoder Township with an appropriation of $366,618 ($210,469 going to the heirs of Frank Cresswell, who still owned Luna Park's land). Subsequently, a vote of the Johnstown City Commission restored the Roxbury Park name to the still-open amusement parkThomas Gary Smith, Green Republican: John Saylor and the Preservation of America's Wilderness (University of Pittsburgh Press 2006) and gradually converted Roxbury Park into a municipal park. No trace remains of the racetrack or the amusement park itself.

Singer originally described the single species in 1950 for an agaric he and a colleague had collected in Tucum√°n Province, Argentina. He placed the new species in the genus Armillariella, which he considered to be the correct name of Armillaria. However, he later came to realize that the species was unusual due to being found with joint teleomorphic and anamorphic forms, both of which produced arthrospores (a type of conidiospore). Thus he erected a new genus for the species in his 1970 treatment of tribe Omphalinae for the Flora Neotropica series, also describing its anamorph as Nothoclavulina ditopa. The species and genus remain known from only the type collection, and more specifically the Nothoclavulina, the agaricoid half having been lost. In 2005, it was announced that new species had been discovered that belonged to the genus, but further study indicated that they represented separate genera not closely related to Arthrosporella (as was first thought), and they were described in 2007 as Arthromyces and Blastosporella, the former in the Tricholomataceae, the latter in the Lyophyllaceae.

The genus contains four species, none of which is common. Description All four species of Catathelasma are found in North America but only one (C. imperiale) is known in Europe. They are all fairly massive Tricholoma-like fungi, but are distinguished from that genus because they have decurrent gills and (at the microscopic level) because they have amyloid spores and a bilateral gill trama. They are mycorrhizal, growing on the ground under conifers, have a tough consistency, and their stems taper towards the bottom and are often partly buried in the soil. They have prominent veil remnants (two rings, or a ring and a volva). They all tend to be found in the mountains. In Europe the single species varies in frequency from \\"quite rare\\" to \\"rare\\". History and naming The genus Catathelasma was defined by Ruth Ellen Harrison Lovejoy in 1910 based on the type species C. evanescens, which she described as a new species at the same time. In her description she says According to Genaust's etymological dictionary of botanical names, \\"Catathelasma\\" comes from Ancient Greek words \\"kata\\" (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ - downwards) and \\"thelasma\\" (Œ∏ŒÆŒªŒ±œÉŒºŒ± - meaning \\"the act of suckling\\"). He says that the reason for this construction is unclear, but suggests that the author is comparing the shape made by the gills running down the stem with a teat stretched out during suckling. \\"Decurrent\\" means \\"running down the stem\\" and another possible connection with Lovejoy's description is that \\"katatheo\\" (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∏Œ≠œâ) means \\"I run down\\". However it is difficult to see how that could logically give rise to the noun \\"Catathelasma\\". The earlier history of this group of mushrooms took place in Europe. The only European species of the genus was first described in 1845 by Fries under the name Agaricus imperialis. In 1872 Qu√©let classified it within Armillaria and in 1922 the Austrian botanist G√ºnther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau invented for this single species the separate genus Biannularia, a name which is still encountered in the literature. For a time Catathelasma and Biannularia were regarded as separate (though closely related) genera, as for instance in a 1936 paper by Rolf Singer. Later Singer united the genus using Lovejoy's name.

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Dendrocollybia racemosa, commonly known as the branched Collybia or the branched shanklet. The somewhat rare species is found in the Northern Hemisphere, including the Pacific Northwest region of western North America, and Europe, where it is included in several Regional Red Lists. It usually grows on the decaying fruit bodies of other agarics‚Äîsuch as Lactarius and Russula‚Äîalthough the host mushrooms may be decayed to the point of being difficult to recognize. Dendrocollybia racemosa fruit bodies have small pale grayish-white or grayish-brown caps up to wide, and thin stems up to long. The species is characterized by its unusual stem, which is covered with short lateral branches. The branches often produce spherical slimeheads of translucent conidiophores on their swollen tips. The conidiophores produce conidia (asexual spores) by mitosis. Because the fungus can rely on either sexual or asexual modes of reproduction, fruit bodies sometimes have reduced or even missing caps. The unusual stems originate from black pea-sized structures called sclerotia. The anamorphic form of the fungus, known as Tilachlidiopsis racemosa, is missing the sexual stage of its life cycle. It can reproduce at relatively low temperatures, an adaptation believed to improve its ability to grow quickly and fruit on decomposing mushrooms. Taxonomy and phylogeny The genus Dendrocollybia was first described in 2001, to accommodate the species previously known as Collybia racemosa. Before then, the so-named taxon was considered to be one of four species of Collybia, a genus which had itself been redefined and reduced in 1997, when most of its species were transferred to Gymnopus and Rhodocollybia. C. racemosa was originally described and named Agaricus racemosus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797, and sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. In his Systema Mycologicum, Fries classified it in his \\"tribe\\" Collybia along with all other similar small, white-spored species with a convex cap and a fragile stem. In 1873 Lucien Qu√©let raised Fries' tribe Collybia to generic rank. Samuel Frederick Gray called the species Mycena racemosa in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants; both this name and Joanne Lennox's 1979 Microcollybia racemosa are considered synonyms. Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his comprehensive Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa in section Collybia, in addition to the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C. tuberosa, C. cirrhata and C. cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C. tuberosa, C. cirrhata and C. cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum‚ÄìTricholoma‚ÄìCollybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C. racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C. racemosa. The fungus is commonly known as the branched Collybia, or the branched shanklet; Samuel Gray referred to it as the \\"racemelike high-stool\\". The specific epithet racemosa is from the Latin word racemus‚Äî\\"a cluster of grapes\\". Description Esenbeck's Das System der Pilze und Schw√§mme (1816) The cap of Dendrocollybia racemosa is typically between in diameter, and depending on its stage of development, may be conic to convex, or in maturity, somewhat flattened with a slight rounded central elevation (an umbo). The cap surface is dry and opaque, with a silky texture; its color in the center is fuscous (a dusky brownish-gray color), but the color fades uniformly towards the margin. The margin is usually curved toward the gills initially; as the fruit body matures the edge may roll out somewhat, but it also has a tendency to fray or split with age. There may be shallow grooves on the cap that correspond to the position of the gills underneath, which may give the cap edge a crenate (scalloped) appearance. The flesh is very thin (less than 1 mm thick) and fragile, lacking in color, and has no distinctive odor or taste. The gills are relatively broad, narrowly attached to the stem (adnexed), spaced closely together, and colored gray to grayish- tan, somewhat darker than the cap. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend all the way to the stem; they are interspersed between the gills and arranged in up to three series (tiers) of equal length. Occasionally, the fungus produces stems with aborted caps, or with the caps missing entirely. The stem is long by 1 mm thick, roughly equal in width throughout, and tapers to a long \\"root\\" which terminates in a dull black, roughly spherical sclerotium. The stem may be buried deeply in its substrate. The stem surface is roughly the same color as the cap, with a fine whitish powder on the upper surface. In the lower portion, the stem is brownish, and has fine grooves that run lengthwise up and down the surface. The lower half is covered with irregularly arranged short branch-like protuberances at right angles to the stem that measure 2‚Äì3 by 0.5 mm. These projections are cylindrical and tapering, with ends that are covered with a slime head of conidia (fungal spores produced asexually). D. racemosa is the only mushroom species known that forms conidia on side branches of the stem. The sclerotium from which the stem arises is watery grayish and homogeneous in cross section (not divided into internal chambers), with a thin dull black outer coat, and measures in diameter. American mycologist Alexander H. Smith cautioned that novice collectors will typically miss the sclerotium the first time they find the species. The edibility of D. racemosa is unknown, but as David Arora says, the fruit bodies are \\"much too puny and rare to be of value.\\" Microscopic characteristics The spores are narrowly ellipsoid to ovoid, thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 4‚Äì5.5 by 2‚Äì3 ¬µm. When stained with Melzer's reagent, the spores turn a light blue color. The basidia (the spore- bearing cells) are four-spored, measure 16‚Äì20 by 3.5‚Äì4 ¬µm, and taper gradually towards the base. Cystidia are not differentiated in this species. The cap surface is made of a cuticle of radial, somewhat agglutinated, rather coarse hyphae that differ chiefly in size from the underlying tissue‚Äîinitially 1‚Äì3 ¬µm in diameter, becoming 5‚Äì7 ¬µm wide in the underlying tissue. The hyphae are clamped, and encrusted with shallow irregularly shaped masses that are most conspicuous in the surface cells. The gill tissue is made of hyphae that project downward from the cap and arranged in a subparallel fashion, meaning that the hyphae are mostly parallel to one another and are slightly intertwined. The hyphae are clamped, with a narrow, branched compact subhymenium (a narrow zone of small, short hyphae immediately beneath the hymenium) composed of hyphae 2‚Äì3 ¬µm in diameter. The conidia are 8.5‚Äì12 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm, peanut-shaped, non-amyloid (not changing color when stained with Melzer's reagent), clamped, and produced by fragmentation of the coarse mycelium. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Asexual spores are 10.0‚Äì15.5 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm, ellipsoid to oblong, non-amyloid, and contain granular contents. The grayish color of the fruit bodies is caused by encrusted pigments (crystalline aggregates of pigment molecules, possibly melanin) that occur throughout the tissue of the stem and cap, including the gills; these pigments are absent in Collybia species. The lateral projections of the stem form conidia. Similar species In contrast to the three species of Collybia, D. racemosa shows negligible reactivity to common chemical tests used in mushroom identification, including aniline, alpha-napthol, guaiacol, sulfoformol, phenol, and phenol-aniline. The cortex (outer tissue layer) of the sclerotium can be used as a diagnostic character to distinguish between D. racemosa and small white specimens of Collybia. The hyphae of the cortex of D. racemosa are \\"markedly angular\\", in comparison with C. cookei (rounded hyphae) and C. tuberosa (elongated hyphae). The cortical layer in D. racemosa has an arrangement that is known as textura epidermoidea‚Äîwith the hyphae arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Heavy deposits of dark reddish-brown pigment are evident throughout the cortical tissue in or on the walls and the tips of hyphae. The remaining Collybia species, C. cirrhata, does not form sclerotia. Anamorph form The anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage‚Äîor teleomorph stage‚Äîis later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. Tilachlidiopsis racemosa (formerly known as Sclerostilbum septentrionale, described by Alfred Povah in 1932) was shown to be the anamorphic form of Dendrocollybia racemosa. The synnemata (reproductive structures made of compact groups of erect conidiophores) produced by T. racemosa always grow on the stem of Dendrocollybia racemosa. The anamorph has an unusually low optimum growth temperature, between , within a larger growth range of . It is thought this is an adaptation that allows the mycelium to grow quickly and enhance its chances of fruiting on agaric mushrooms, which are generally short-lived. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Russula crassotunicata has been verified as a host for Dendrocollybia. Dendrocollybia racemosa is a saprobic species, meaning it derives nutrients by breaking down dead or dying tissue. Its fruit bodies grow on the well-decayed remains of agarics, often suspected to be Lactarius or Russula, although the hosts' identities are often unclear due to an advanced state of decay. A 2006 study used molecular analysis to confirm Russula crassotunicata as a host for D. racemosa. This Russula has a long and persistent decay period, and, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States where the study was conducted, provides a \\"nearly year-round substrate for mycosaprobic species\\". Dendrocollybia is one of four agaric genera obligately associated with growth on the fruit bodies of other fungi, the others being Squamanita, Asterophora, and Collybia. Dendrocollybia is also found less commonly in deep coniferous duff, in groups or small clusters. The fungus can form sclerotia in the mummified host fruit bodies, and may also develop directly from their sclerotia in soil. The fungus is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but rarely collected \\"probably due to its small size, camouflage color, and tendency to be immersed in its substrate.\\" In North America, where the distribution is restricted to the Pacific Northwest, fruit bodies are found in the late summer to autumn, often after a heavy fruiting period for other mushrooms is over. In Europe, it is known from the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and Belgium. Dendrocollybia racemosa is in the Danish, Norwegian, and British Red Lists. The saprobic behaviors of Collybia and Dendrocollybia are slightly different. In the autumn, fruit bodies of C. cirrhata, C. cookei and C. tuberosa, can be found on blackened, leathery, mummified fruit bodies of their hosts. Sometimes, these species appear to be growing in the soil (or from their sclerotium in soil or moss), but usually not in huge clusters. In these cases it is assumed that the hosts are remnants of fruit bodies from a previous season. In all observed cases of D. racemosa, however, the hosts have not been readily observed, suggesting that rapid digestion of the host (rather than mummification) may have taken place. Hughes and colleagues suggest that this may indicate the presence of a different enzymatic system, and a differing ability to compete with other fungi or bacteria.

It has previously been part of the family of Tricholomataceae, but recent molecular phylogeny has shown it to take an isolated position within the Agaricales. Description The fruitingbody of Infundibulicybe is clitocyboid and not hygrophanous. The cap diameter can vary from 1,5 to 25 cm, with some growing as large as 40 cm. Its shape can be depressed to funnel-like with a velvety to finely scaly surface. The colouration of the basidiocarp is white to pale buff to buff, pinkish buff, yellowish, yellowish brown, orange brown, reddish brown or greyish brown. The gills are decurrent to deeply decurrent. This basidiomycete smells faint, from cyanic to sweet aromatic and faintly camphor-like when fresh. The spore deposit is whitish and spores are dikaryoid, smooth, hyaline and without iodine reactions. The basidia are 4-spored, cheilocystidia are absent and clamp connections present. They grow saprotrophic on litter of leaves and needles or soil in forests, grassland and alpine habitats. Infundibulicybe shares some characteristics with Omphalina, like the cream-reddish brown tinges of pileus and stipe, the deeply decurrent lamellae and strongly encrusting pigment. Another member of the group, I. lateritia is a rare alpine-arctic species strictly associated with Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae). Taxonomy The group was formerly included in the genus Clitocybe, but in 2003 was erected to genus level to accommodate species for which mycelium cannot reduce nitrate and basidiospores do not adhere in tetrads, but exhibit a lacrymoid (tear-shaped) morphology, a confluent base and a cyanophobic basidiospore wall. The genus contains 19 widespread species according to the Index Fungorum and one new species I. rufa, only known from high altitude localities in southwestern China, described in 2016.

The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words makros \\"long\\" and kube \\"head\\". The genus is related to the genus Calocybe. The species form huge pale fleshy mushrooms that often grow in clumps on dead wood in the ground. The weight of the cluster may exceed 30 kg. The caps are convex to depressed, and sometimes have a central boss (umbo), and are white to cream or pale ochre or grey. One species, M. titans, has a cap that can reach a metre (40 in) in diameter. The white gills are sinuate. The flesh is white and does not change colour when bruised. The stipe is white and often has a swollen base. The spore print is white. The round to oval spores are less than 10 micrometres long and smooth. The species are saprobic, growing on dead wood in grass generally. One species, M. gigantea, has been found growing on elephant dung in Kerala state in India, and M. crassa has been cultivated on horse manure in Thailand.

The genus contains six species that are widespread in northern temperate areas. Pseudoomphalina was circumscribed by Rolf Singer in 1956. Pseudoomphalina was found to be paraphyletic to Neohygrophorus in a molecular phylogenetics study and since Pseudoomphalina is an older name, Neohygrophyorus was synonymized with it. The type species of Neohygrophorus was Neohygrophorus angelesianus, now Pseudoomphalina angelesiana. In earlier classifications based on anatomy prior to DNA sequence-based classifications, its unusual combination of features led taxonomists to independently create two subgenera in two genera: Hygrophorus subg. Pseudohygrophorus and Clitocybe subg. Mutabiles; the latter based on Neohygrophorus angelesianus but described under a new species name which is now placed in synonymy, Clitocybe mutabilis. All species of Pseudoomphalina are united by the presence of clamp-connections in their hyphae, an interwoven gill trama and amyloid spores. Pseudoomphalina angelesiana possesses grey- violaceous pigments that turn red in alkali solutions and lacks filiform, hyphal sterile elements in its hymenium and stipitipellis. These were features used to distinguish it from Pseudoomphalina as a genus, but Pseudoomphalina umbrinopurpurascens possesses these same pigments and the filiform elements of Pseudoomphalina. Molecular phylogenetics studies have also found some former species of Pseudoomphalina to belong in other genera. Pseudoomphalina pachyphylla was moved to its own genus, Pseudolaccaria, and Pseudoomphalina clusiliformis was synonymized with it. Pseudoomphalina flavoaurantia and Pseudoomphalina lignicola were found to belong in Clitocybula. Phylogenetically, Pseudoomphalina is in a tricholomatoid clade but not in the Tricholomataceae.

The fruitbodies of this genus resemble a normal agaric but they emerge from parasitized fruitbodies of other agarics that Squamanita has deformed. The deformation may be massive and the host may then resemble a lump, or the deformation may be so subtle that the Squamanita appears to be grafted onto the stipe of the host that nearly always fails to form a pileus. Because of the seamless graft-like attachment or the severe deformation of the host into a nonrecognizable blob, early descriptions included features of the host in descriptions of Squamanita as if they were parts of the parasite. This error led to the creation of a separate subgenus because of misinterpretation of host veil tissue as part of the parasite and ultimately a separate genus, Dissoderma. Serendipitous discovery of one parasitized host fruitbody (Galerina) that formed its own pileus that then bore three Squamanita contortipes fruitbodies revealed the parasitic nature of the relationship for that species and the entire genus. This discovery was so shocking that it was featured in Nature magazine under the title 'Mycological mystery tour'. Once the parasitic nature was revealed, the term 'protocarpic tuber' used by earlier authors for the parasitized host base was replaced by the term 'cecidiocarp'. Since 1994 other investigative research on finds of this rare genus of mushrooms has shown that Squamanita odorata is a parasite of Hebeloma mesophaeum, Squamanita paradoxa parasitizes Cystoderma amianthinum, and Squamanita umbonata parasitizes Inocybe oblectabilis.

Though its name is identical to the country of Panama, the breed was in fact named for the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition where it was shown early on in its history. Panama sheep originated in 1912 in Muldoon, Idaho. Today Panama sheep are rare - largely unknown outside Idaho and Montana, and are one of only a few breeds which were started by private individuals in the United States. They were developed by James Laidlaw, a Scottish immigrant to the region who was seeking a large sheep better suited to the range than the Merinos which were most common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The foundation of the breed was a cross of Rambouillet rams to Lincoln ewes. Panamas are polled sheep with white fleece of medium length and a large body suitable for meat production. Panama rams average 250‚Äì280 pounds and Panama ewes average 180‚Äì210 pounds when fully grown. They are particularly known for hardiness in the rough conditions of the northern Rocky Mountains. A breed registry was formed in 1951, but it has been inactive and it's unclear whether the majority of Panamas present today have not been crossbred. The sole remaining flock that is known to be pure is one maintained by the University of Idaho.

Oct. 2, 1916. p. 9. The western was re-released in 1924. It is currently available on DVD. Plot Advertisement The Return of Draw Egan The setting is the American Wild West. The notorious outlaw leader\\"Draw\\" Egan (played by Hart) and his gang is chased by a posse of lawmen to his remote mountain cabin, where they are trapped. During a fierce shootout, Egan opens a trapdoor and they escape through a tunnel before the posse can overwhelm them. With a bounty on his head, Egan turns up in the dangerous frontier range town of Yellow Dog. Presenting himself by the assumed name William Blake, he enters the saloon. The seductive dance-hall girl, Poppy (played by Glaum), uses her alluring wiles to entice and entertain him. He looks amused when he is challenged to fight by a rowdy barfly, then punches and finishes the man off with the one powerful blow. The townspeople are impressed. Believing Blake to be a strong and law-abiding man, they want him to be their new marshal. The reformist mayor, Mat Buckton (played by Lockney), hires him for the much avoided position to restore law and order and rid the town of the lawless gunmen who have nearly taken over. Blake turns Yellow Dog into a model community, while hiding his criminal past, and plans to move on soon. But when he sees the mayor's daughter, Myrtle Buckton (played by Wilson), he decides to stay on as marshal of Yellow Dog. Beginning a romance with the God-fearing young woman, he proceeds to settle down and become a genuinely lawful and respected member of the town. Then Arizona Joe (played by McKim), a member of Egan's former gang, shows up in Yellow Dog to make trouble. He threatens to expose Egan's past if he tries to make him obey the law and not help him take over the town. The marshal gives in for a while, but then decides that the welfare of the town is more important than his romance with Myrtle. When he goes after Arizona Joe, the outlaw keeps his word and tells the whole town about Draw Egan. During the final showdown, which is short and brutal, Egan shoots and kills Joe. He then surrenders himself for arrest, but the grateful townspeople refuse to hear of it and offer to keep him in office. He is also prepared to give up Myrtle, but she tells him that his past is unimportant and they begin making plans for their future together. Cast in credited order *William S.

Biography Jan Josef Ign√°c Brentner was born into the family of the mayor of the small town of Dob≈ôany in Western Bohemia. He seems to have preferred his middle name Josef/Joseph. What we know about him comes mostly from time he spent in Prague, from 1717 to about 1720, where he published four collections of music. Brentner's opuses 1 and 3 are collections of sacred arias for voice, strings, and continuo, Harmonica duodecatomeria ecclesiastica (1716) and Hymnodia divina (1718 or 1719). In addition, Brentner published a collection of six offertories for chorus, strings, and continuo entitled Offertoria solenniora (1717) as his opus 2 and a collection of six chamber concertos, Horae pomeridianae seu Concertus cammerales (1720) as his opus 4. Brentner's patron was Raymond Wilfert, abbot of the Premonstratensian (Norbertine) monastery in Tepl√°, to whom the Op. 2 was dedicated. Brentner's funeral motets were written specifically for the Brotherhood of St. Nicholas Church in Prague. Brentner died in his home town of Dob≈ôany. Although a great many of Brentner's works are known to be lost, a scattering of manuscript copies survive throughout the Czech lands and a large number of them are located in the Music Archive of the Bendiktinerstift in G√∂ttweig, Austria. Still others have turned up, in modified versions, in Bolivia; no one knows how Brentner's music managed to travel to South America.

He was also one of the architects of the 1929 Lateran Treaty, which ended the \\"Roman Question\\" (a dispute over the status of the papacy since the Italian unification), and recognized the sovereignty of Vatican City, which made it an actor of international relations.TIME. 1928, May 12. \\"ITALY: Jesuit Stabbed\\". A claimed attempt to assassinate Venturi with a paper knife (actually the result of a homosexual lovers' quarrel), one year before the treaty's completion, made headlines around the world. Venturi had begun the process of reconciliation by convincing Mussolini to donate the valuable library of the Palazzo Chigi to the Vatican. According to Susan Zuccotti, Venturi \\"had an uncanny ability to gain access where more official papal diplomats could not\\" and thus was utilized for some of the most important papal priorities.Zuccotti, 2000, p. 124. Venturi had no official rank in the church to match his extraordinary influence, and was known in Vatican circles as the \\"man in black\\".  Early life (1861-1922) Venturi was born in San Severino Marche.Tacchi Venturi, Pietro, Enciclopedie on line, Treccani.it. He became a member of the Society of Jesus, a religious order within the Catholic Church, in 1878. He established a reputation as a scholar of history and literature.Salvatore Cortesi. 1928, February 11. \\"Italy to Indemnify Church, Rome Hears\\". New York Times. p. 4. Venturi was admitted into the Pontifical Academy of Archaeology and other scientific bodies. Venturi was the official historian of the Italian branch of the Jesuit order and the Secretary of the Society of Jesus from 1914 to 1921. His magnum opus was a history of the Jesuits. Another important work by Venturi was the publication of previously unpublished writings of Matteo Ricci, one of the founders of the Jesuit China missions. The Opere storiche del P. Matteo Ricci, S.J (Historical Works of Father Matteo Ricci, S.J.) appeared in two volumes in 1911 and 1913, and included Ricci's letters as well as his Commentarj della Cina (Commentary on China), the Italian manuscript that had been previously published only in the expanded and edited Latin version of Nicolas Trigault (as De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas). However, Venturi's lack of knowledge of Chinese made it necessary for Fr. Pasquale d'Elia to produce another, better annotated edition of Ricci's manuscripts (known as Fonti Ricciane) some 30 years later, in the 1940s.\\"Dicion√°rio Portugu√™s-Chin√™s : Ëë°Ê±âËæûÂÖ∏ (Pu-Han cidian): Portuguese-Chinese dictionary\\", by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W. Witek. Published 2001, Biblioteca Nacional. . Partial preview available on Google Books. P. 179. Pius XI's liaison to Mussolini (1922-1939)=Chigi library donation (1922) Mussolini, whom he befriended before his rise to power. Benito Mussolini \\"liked and trusted\\" Venturi, whom he had known since 1922, during the Fascist struggle for power.Chadwick, 1988, p. 62. The friendship between the two predated Mussolini's rise to power. He thus became the \\"normal instrument for messages between the pope and Mussolini\\". Venturi's relationship with Mussolini became professional when Pope Pius XI chose him to negotiate the purchase of the ancient library of the Palazzo Chigi (the residence of the prominent Chigi family) from the newly created Fascist regime (the Italian government was on the verge of buying the collection). Venturi persuaded Mussolini to donate an ancient state collection of religious books to the Vatican free of charge. Vatican attempts to buy the texts date back to Pope Benedict XV, who lacked the requisite funds to complete the transaction. Mussolini's donation became the start of the process of reconciliation between the Italian government and the papacy, which had been at odds since the Papal States were seized during the Italian unification. Along with Count Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, Venturi served as the unofficial, yet authoritative \\"intermediary between Palazzo Venezia and the Vatican\\".Webster, 1960, p. 115. Venturi was also the personal Confessor of Mussolini and an adviser to the Duce on religious matters generally.Webster, 1960, p. 122. His political views could generally be classified as a strain of Clerico-Fascism. Venturi was an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist who believed the Catholic Church was threatened by a \\"worldwide Jewish-Masonic plutocracy\\" and advocated putting all Italian Jewish bankers under police surveillance.Kertzer 2014 p.89. In September 1926, Venturi gave Mussolini a pamphlet entitled Zionism and Catholicism accusing the Jews of wanting \\"to destroy current society and dominate the world themselves, as their Talmud proscribes\\".Kertzer 2014 p.89. Lateran Treaties (1927-1929) Venturi was a negotiator of the Lateran Treaty (1929), which ended the \\"Roman Question\\" (a dispute over the status of the papacy since the Italian unification) and officially recognized the sovereignty of Vatican City, which led the Church State to become an actor in international relations (apart from the Holy See itself, as it had previously been) according to international law. In May 1928, already internationally known for his role as a negotiator, Venturi survived an attempted assassination by \\"Signor De Angelis\\" with a paper knife, receiving only a neck laceration when he ducked out the way.New York Times. 1928, February 29. \\"Stabs Jesuit Agent in Vatican Issue\\". p. 5. Two years later, another priest similar to Venturi in appearance was killed.TIME. 1931, September 7. \\"ITALY- PAPAL STATE: Man In Black\\". Venturi claimed to have been the victim of an international conspiracy organized by an anti-Fascist group based in Paris led by Gaetano Salvemini, but the police were highly doubtful of his story.Kertzer 2014 p.91. It was established during the police investigation that Ventrui was a homosexual who had \\"illicit relations\\" with young men he picked up on the streets of Rome and took back to his apartment for sex, and the murder attempt was just a lovers' quarrel.Kertzer 2014 p.93-94. The New York Times described Venturi as the \\"chief negotiator, who remains in the dark and is almost unknown\\". Noting Pius XI and Mussolini's penchant for privacy regarding the negotiations, the Times continued to describe Venturi as \\"a quiet man who could tell much\\" yet refused to acknowledge that he was any more than \\"Mussolini's personal messenger to the Vatican\\".Edwin L. James. 1928, April 16. \\"Mussolini Presses Accord with Church\\". New York Times. p. 1. Nominally, Francesco Pacelli (the brother of Eugenio Pacelli, future Pope Pius XII) became the chief negotiator and Venturi his intermediary with Mussolini during the final stages of the negotiation (after the death of State Councilor Domenico Barone).Arnaldo Cortesi. 1929, January 11. \\"Formula Reported for a Papal State\\". New York Times. p. 28. The other negotiators were Francesco Borgongini Duca, the Vatican's Secretary of Extraordinary Affairs, and Professor Gianinni Barone, the brother of Domenico; however, Venturi himself was the originator of the negotiations.New York Times. 1929, January 15. \\"Italy Offers Pope Additional Land and Indemnity\\". p. 1.T.J.C. Martyn. 1929, January 20. \\"Holy See to Appear as a Sovereign State\\". New York Times. p. XX3. Venturi received the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus from the Italian monarchy in 1932 for his role in negotiating the treaty.New York Times. 1932, May 4. \\"Italy's Chief Order is Given to Pacelli\\". p. 11. Francesco Borgongini Duca, the nuncio to Italy from 1929‚Äì1953, supplemented Venturi as the official liaison between Pius XII and Mussolini, but Venturi retained his influence.Morley, 1980, pp. 167-177. Mussolini novel (1929) At the urging of Venturi, Mussolini wrote a second book ‚Äì Una Conversione ‚Äì about his conversion to Catholicism, meant as a sequel to his twenty-year-old novel which was extremely critical of the church: Claudia Particella: l'amante del Cardinale (translated and published in English as The Cardinal's Mistress).New York Times. 1929, May 26. \\"Mussolini Writing of his Conversion\\". p. E8. Venturi himself wrote the preface to Una Conversione. Catholic Action (1931) In 1931, Venturi negotiated the end to a dispute between Pius XI and Mussolini regarding, Azione Cattolica, the Italian branch of Catholic Action, a lay Catholic community organization group.Arnaldo Cortesi. 1931, August 20. \\"Pope Consults Aide on Italian Dispute\\". New York Times. p. 6. Venturi was granted an unheard of hour-long audience with the pontiff during his summer vacation, and then an additional meeting with Cardinal Secretary of State Pacelli. The Vatican claimed that Venturi was merely \\"preparing the ground for official negotiation\\".Arnoldo Cortesi. 1931, August 26. \\"Italy and Vatican Approach Solution\\". New York Times. p. 7. Don Luigi Sturzo, the founder of the Partito Popolare Italiano, a Catholic political party in Italy, credits Venturi with ending the dispute.Webster, 1960, p. 203. Mussolini allowed the 15,000 youth organizations to reopen, but they were required to affiliate closely with the official Fascist youth organization, Opera Nazionale Balilla.New York Times. 1931, August 27. \\"Mussolini to Make Peace with Vatican\\". p. 1. The terms of the agreement were meant to give the Vatican a role in \\"Fascist Youth Education\\" and required that the Catholic organization be devolved to the diocesan level, with no centralized hierarchy, and that chaplains be attached to the Balilla chapters.Arnado Cortesi. 1931, August 29. \\"Vatican to Share in Fascist Youth Education; Rome will Permit Catholic Clubs to Reopen\\". New York Times. p. 6. Venturi himself sat in on the final meeting between Mussolini and the pope.Arnaldo Cortesi. 1931, September 1. \\"Italy Begins Return of Clubs to Church\\". New York Times. p. 1. Drafting of the Anti-Jewish laws (1938) Venturi was kept informed by Mussolini during the drafting of Italy's anti-Jewish laws (which deprived Jews of various civil, political, and economic rights), expressing concerns about the effect of the laws on Catholics, both through mixed marriages and Catholic converts from Judaism.Arnaldo Cortesi. 1938, November 11. \\"Italy Intensifies Curbs Upon Jews\\". New York Times. p. 1. Specifically, Venturi sought the lifting of the ban on marriages between \\"Aryans\\" and \\"non-Aryans\\".New York Times. 1938, November 20. \\"Italy's 'Race' Laws Take 15,000 Jobs\\". p. 33. Role under Pius XII (1939-1956) Badoglio, Mussolini's successor as head of government, to advocate the continuation of the Anti-Jewish laws which did not affect Catholics. Upon the election of Pius XII by the papal conclave, 1939, it was announced that Dom Francesco Tomasetti (d. May 5, 1953New York Times. 1953, May 6. \\"Father Tomasetti, Head of Salesians\\". p. 31.), the procurator general of the Salesian Order, would replace Venturi as the unofficial messenger between the pope and Mussolini after \\"a struggle of another kind, less open but having many of the same elements as that over the choice of Secretary of State\\".Michael Williams. 1939, March 11. \\"Idea of Strength Radiated by Pope\\". New York Times. p. 4. Venturi remained the official representative to various Italian government agencies such as the heads of police and general board of demographics and race.Blet, 1999, p. 156. On the eve of World War II, Cardinal Luigi Maglione, the Vatican Secretary of State, used Venturi as his emissary with Mussolini.Watt, 1989, p.560 Venturi persuaded Mussolini to give his approval to Pius XII's plan to mediate between the Five Powers (the Axis powers of Germany and Italy and the Allies of the United Kingdom, France, and Poland). Through Venturi, who continued to be \\"very important\\" to Pius XII because of his weight with Mussolini, Pius XII communicated to the Italian government his disapproval of the French and British attempts to negotiate an alliance with Soviet Russia, the so-called \\"peace front\\".Camille M. Cianfarra. 1939, June 7. \\"Pope Seeks to Bar Soviet from Pact\\". New York Times. p. 1. The Vatican did not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Pius XII also sent Venturi to Brussels for mediation negotiations with regard to the Danzig crisis in the summer of 1939 in an attempt to avert World War II.Herbert L. Matthews. 1939, August 24. \\"No Military Moves Apparent in Italy\\". New York Times. p. 1. Venturi was a key player in the negotiations, though they accomplished nothing.Herbert E. Matthews. 1939, August 31. \\"'End of Versailles' is Italy's Demand\\". New York Times. p. 7. The plan that Mussolini presented to Venturi to end the Danzig crisis called for Poland to allow the Free City of Danzig to rejoin Germany in exchange for negotiations with Germany about allowing the Poles to use Danzig without customs duties.Watt, 1989, p.560 The plan also called for German-Polish negotiations on the returning the Polish Corridor to Germany and on the status of the German minority in Poland and Polish minority in Germany.Watt, 1989, p.560 Despite the opposition of Cardinal Domenico Tardini who complained the peace plan favored Germany at the expense of Poland, Venturi persuaded both Cardinal Maglione and Pius to accept it as the last, best chance to stop another world war.Watt, 1989, p.560 On 31 August 1939, Monsignor Filippo Cortesi, the Papal Nuncio in Warsaw, presented Mussolini's peace plan to Jan Szembek, appealing to him as a Catholic to accept this solution to the Danzig crisis that had been endorsed by the Pope, but the Polish government rejected it under the grounds that this plan lopsidedly favored Germany.Watt, 1989, p.560 The Ustashe regime On a few occasions, Venturi used this influence to spare Catholic converts from Judaism from the Holocaust. The fascistic Ustashe regime that ruled Croatia between 1941-45 had a policy of exterminating some of the Serb, Jewish and Romany minorities while forcing others to convert to Catholicism. Michael Phayer documents one such occasion where Venturi intervened on behalf of Croatian converts.Phayer, 2000, p. 39. Venturi is otherwise little mentioned in Phayer's book, referred to simply as a \\"Jesuit rescuer\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 102. Opposition to repeal of Anti-Jewish laws (1943) In August 1943, when Marshall Pietro Badoglio, Mussolini's successor, was contemplating a complete rescission of Italy's anti-Jewish laws, Venturi met with the Secretary of the Interior and requested that only the portions affecting Jewish converts to Catholicism be repealed.Goldhagen, 2002, p. 149. In doing so, Venturi was advancing the position of Pius XII, as he later reported to Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione.Goldhagen, 2002, p. 150. Venturi assured Maglione: > I took care not to call for the total abrogation of a law which, according > to the principles and traditions of the Catholic Church, certainly has some > clauses that should be abolished, but which clearly contains others that > have merit and should be confirmed. The Roman razzia (1943) After the Roman razzia (the deportation of Roman Jews to death camps as part of The Holocaust), Venturi recommended to the Vatican Secretariat a \\"symbolic and therefore sham inquiry into the fate of the Jews of Rome\\".Goldhagen, 2002, p. 170. He reasoned, \\"a step like this by the Holy See, even if it does not obtain the desired effect, will without doubt help increase the veneration and gratitude toward the August Person of the Holy Father\\". Death Nothing else is known of the role of Venturi after the death of Mussolini on April 28, 1945, or for that matter after Mussolini's fall from power. Venturi died \\"virtually forgotten\\" on March 18, 1956, at the age of 95. NotesReferences *Blet, Pierre, and Johnson, Lawrence J. 1999.

Life  Camille Papin Tissot was the second child of Pierre Tissot and Adeline Alexandrine G√©rardin, born on 15 October 1868. Their third child, Esther Ad√®le Tissot, was born on 1 April 1872. The two surviving children, Camille and Esther, were primarily raised by their mother, as their father was often at sea. Recommended by his father, Camille Tissot entered the naval college at Brest in 1884 when he was 16 years old. He studied navigation on the school ship Le Borda until 1886, and was then posted to the port of Brest. In the first years of his career in the navy, he was successively posted to various school ships and warships, finally to the cruiser \\"Coetlogon\\". He then turned to shore duty as of 23 January 1891. He agreed to temporarily occupy one of the teaching positions in physics and chemistry of the naval school. He stayed on for 21 years as a professor in √âcole Navale. The passion of sciences having been transmitted to him by his father, he obtained the degree of Bachelor of the Physical sciences. It was as a professor in √âcole Navale that he became devoted to the study of the electric oscillations and their application in the maritime field. Tissot acquired ranks during his various assignments: * 1 August 1886: Aspirant of second class * 5 October 1887: Aspirant of first class * 5 October 1889: Enseigne de vaisseau * 22 August 1896: Lieutenant de vaisseau * 19 April 1912: Capitaine de fr√©gate This last promotion was exceptional for a sailor who practically never sailed. It was due to the importance of the work undertaken by Tissot for the Navy. In 1894, Camille Tissot met and married Jeanne Emma Stapfer, a 20-year-old woman of an Alsacienne family who moved to Brest in 1870. He nominally converted to the Catholic religion at the request of his father-in-law, although his own beliefs were socialist and atheist. Among the guests at his wedding were Albert Turpain and Marcel Cachin, very committed members of Parliament and future founder of French Communist Party in 1920. They had one daughter, Camille.  Work  In 1902 Tissot used a coherer receiver of this type at the lighhouse at Ushant, communicating over a range of 80 kilometers. Article by Camille Tissot, published in the n¬∞ 57 of July 1906 of the bulletin of the \\"Company of the Electricians\\" (Soci√©t√© des √©lectriciens). In 1896, when the work of Lodge and of Marconi concerning wireless telegraphy was still little known, Tissot undertook parallel and independent research. He built apparatus for radio experiments with the assistance of E. Branly and of the manufacturer Eugene Ducretet for whom later he will develop apparatus. On 3 August 1898, Tissot demonstrates the first French operational radio connection at sea, covering 800 meters between \\"BORDERED\\" and an on-shore semaphore station. Convinced, the Minister of Marine on 6 August agrees to finance purchase of material to allow him to continue his tests. With this apparatus Camille Tissot in 1899 organized a large trial run and demonstrates communications by radio, initially between various points of the roads of Brest and the Saint Martin church, then to the islands Vierge (Plouguerneau) and Stiff (Ushant). In 1898 he also established radio contact to the island of Ouessant. This station will become Ushant radio station, with call sign FFU ( French Fixe of Ushant), which is active there until 1943. In 1899, Tissot published a report describing his work and experiments through the roads of Brest. In 1900, Tissot equipped the French Navy with its first radio apparatus. In 1902, the station Ushant TSF is established with a radio operator, receiver with coherer, and an arc transmitter. This station had a radio telegraphy range of 80 kilometers with a fleet of 14 ships at sea and with Brest. In 1904 the Ouessant radio station with call sign FFU carried out radiotelegraphic connections on 600 meters with a fleet of passenger ships. From 1905, Tissot made very thorough studies on the detection of radio signals. Following these tests, Tissot showed the possibility of using radio to transmit a time signal and to regulate the chronometers of the ships at sea. The Bureau des Longitudes started daily time signal service starting in May 1910. In 1907, Tissot conceived, with F Pellin, a Crystal radio without tiresome adjustment to receive signals aboard ships. In 1911, his technical expertise was required by a committee of French industrialists carried out by E Girardeau, during the series of lawsuits between the Marconi Company and French radio companies. With the occasion of these lawsuits, Tissot and F√©rri√© in particular sought to show certain faults of patent 77777 of Marconi, but also the priority of experiments of certain French scientists, like Eugene Ducretet. Marconi won the lawsuit, but the decision of the court, which gave the Marconi the right to replace the French material by material made by Marconi, will never be applied in France. During the First World War, Tissot made several stays at Bizerte, to equip ships with radio and to work on detection of underwater sound. Commander Tissot died in October 1917 of pulmonary tuberculosis and influenza. He was buried in the military square of the cemetery of Arcachon. He was an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and Officer of the State education.  Publications  R√©sonance of the antenna He wrote three detailed works: * M√©moire de th√®se de Doctorat sur la r√©sonance des antennes (1905). Memory of thesis of Doctorate on the resonance of the antennas. * Trait√© sur les oscillations √©lectriques (1906) Treaty on the electric oscillations. * Manuel de TSF th√©orique et pratique (1912), Handbook of theoretical and practical TSF (1912), republished until 1932 (6th edition). * books written by Camille Tissot. He was also the author of many articles of popularization of radio in international scientific reviews, and gave very many conferences on the subject. Although not a member, he intervened regularly in front of the Academy of the Sciences. He received several prizes and rewards of the Academy.

Note that the right-hand building is older than the left-hand one, and more similar to the older shoin style. is one type of Japanese residential architectural style. Suki means refined, well cultivated taste and delight in elegant pursuitsKenkyusha's New Japanese English Dictionary, Fourth Edition 1974, p.1674 and refers to enjoyment of the exquisitely performed tea ceremony. The word originally denoted a building in which tea ceremony was done (known as a chashitsu) and was associated with ikebana flower arranging, and other Japanese traditional arts. It has come to indicate a style of designing public facilities and private homes based on tea house aesthetics.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, First Edition 1983,vol. 7, p.265 Historically and by tradition, sukiya-zukuri is characterised by a use of natural materials, especially wood. In contemporary architecture, its formal and spatial concepts are kept alive in modern materials such as steel, glass and concrete.Itoh (1972), p224 Origins In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536‚Äì98) employed the tea master Sen no Riky≈´ as his advisor on aesthetic matters. In the compound of Hideyoshi's imposing Jurakudai castle in Kyoto Riky≈´ designed an eighteen mat building known as the Coloured Shoin which was thought to be the first example of sukiya-zukuri architecture.Itoh (1972), p12 The style developed during the rest of the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568‚Äì1600) and was characterised by small rooms of usually four and a half tatami, or even less, that had a tokonoma and shelves.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, First Edition 1983,vol. 7, p.265 These buildings were normally entered through a garden often by means of an indirect curved or diagonal path that would not allow an instant view of the teahouse.Itoh (1972), p96 Sukiya-zukuri architecture incorporates tea house aesthetics and encompasses all sorts of building types including private dwellings, villas, restaurants and inns. One of the best known examples is the Katsura Detached Palace in Kyoto. In the Edo period (1600‚Äì1868) sukiya-zukuri became popular among townspeople, and the majority of houses came to be built in this style.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, First Edition 1983,vol. 7, p.265 Comparison with similar styles In the Azuchi- Momoyama period not only sukiya style but the contrasting shoin-zukuri of residences of the warrior class developed. While sukiya was a small space, simple and austere, shoin-zukuri style was that of large, magnificent reception areas, the setting for the pomp and ceremony of the feudal lords. As an example, in a shoin, the flower arrangement in the tokonoma is indicative of the relative wealth of the host, the guest however sits with their back to it as it is not meant for their enjoyment. Whereas, in a tearoom, the guest sits facing the tokonoma and enjoys its beauty.Itoh (1972), p23 A comparison with shoin-zukuri makes clear the defining stylistic features of sukiya- zukuri. The \\"frieze rails\\" called nageshi connect grooved, square columns in shoin-zukuri, the transom is often elaborately carved, the ceiling is coffered or railed with a hexagonal rail and the wall surfaces are finished and often decorated with murals. The toko alcove, tana shelves and shoin built-in desk are arranged according to a fixed formula. In contrast, sukiya-zukuri often uses unsquared columns, even simple polished tree trunks, or wood with the bark in place for the nakabashira central column. The walls are simply finished with a natural earthen plaster, and any carving in the ranma transom is kept simple. The ceiling of boards is railed with flat, rectangular boards. Although there is a tokonoma alcove and tana shelves and maybe also shoin in the main room, their arrangement and treatment are free. The beauty of sukiya- zukuri comes from the delicate sensibility of the slender wood elements and other natural materials used, and the simplicity of ornamentation, if any.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan Development In the Coloured Shoin teahouse Sen no Riky≈´ stained the timbers with a mixture of Bengal red dye and black dye to make them look sooty and old. In contrast, his student's Oribe and Enshu preferred brighter colours and natural finishes. It is thought that this change coincided with the development of the regular wood plane that allowed a more consistent finish to wood and a better appreciation of the natural qualities of unfinished wood. It is a trait that has characterised the sukiya style since.Itoh (1972), p20 After the Meiji Restoration in 1867 the samurai class and thus the shoin-style lost its reason for being whereas the sukiya style continued to develop and was reassessed for modernist architecture. The sukiya style requires a subtle harmony between the principles required in its construction, these include the relationship between the client, the architect and the carpenter. Both the architect and the carpenter should have a profound understanding of the materials employed.Itoh (1972), p25 There is an example of a carpenter asked to build a sukiya style house declining because he lost his tools in World War Two and he felt that he would not be in a position to work satisfactorily.Zwerger (2000), p59 Writing in 1934 the architect Isoya Yoshida encouraged architects to design in the sukiya-style using modern materials. He said that it was important to display the natural characteristics of the wood although it would be a mistake to use anything that might catch the eye as this was not in the spirit of the style.Itoh (1972), p26 Though originally conceived in natural materials, primarily wood, sukiya style adapted itself to modern materials, namely concrete and steel, as builders and architects seek to incorporate sukiya interior design elements into modern buildings in an urban environment. This is not seen as a dilution of the design idiom -- as architectural historian Teiji Itoh points out, \\"in its formative years, the sukiya tradition was concerned primarily with interior design. ... Sukiya style is well suited to [modern buildings] because it is concerned primarily with conforming a certain decor to an already established spatial entity.\\"Itoh (1972), pp220-221 That said, in most cases, sukiya design in an urban setting is far from the original spirit of a \\"mountain retreat in the city\\" as it was conceived in the 16th century Japan of Sen no Riky≈´. Shutter systems The transition between the Shoin and Sukiya styles occurred during the early 1600s, as a new structure for storm shutters was devised. By stacking the opaque wooden sliding doors in a box called a to-bukuro, instead of simply overlapping them, the amount of light in the interior doubled, and unbroken views of the garden could be obtained. The lede picture of the transitional Katsura Imperial Villa shows both systems. File:Nijo Castle J09 40-focused-right (cropped to retainer's hall).jpgOn the right, three grooves, three panels. The maira-do are open, and the single sh≈çji panel closed; half of the area is still filled with the maira-do. The building to the left is newer; its outer groove runs outside the pillars. The shutters are packed away in the to-bukuro in the corner, and the sh≈çji in the inner two grooves run uninterrupted. File:Castello nijo 03 ohiroma ichi-no-ma.JPGFrom the inside, light levels are lower. The reflective gold paint used extensively in Shoin style buildings helps compensate. File:PocketDoorM0575.jpgGlass is heavier than paper; here, a temple has to-bukuro cupboards the doors can slide into without having to be lifted and carried away. File:Storm-door,amado,narita-city,japan.JPGAma-do rotator; outer ama-do groove cut away for half an ama-do width on each side. Glass doors and sh≈çji get two grooves each. File:Mairado-to-amado, shoin-to- sukiya-style.svgPlan view of the mairado and amado shutter systems, showing rotator and to-bukuro. The black squares are pillars; sh≈çji in white, rain shutters in black, grooves in grey. File:JapanHomes103 SECTION THROUGH VERANDAH AND GUEST-ROOM (SVG).svgSection through a Sukiya-style middle-class home In the first half of the 1600s, at the beginning of the Edo period, the outermost groove was moved outside the line of pillars. The wooden shutters placed in this groove interlocked edge-to-edge, and were called ama-do (Èõ®Êà∏, \\"rain-door\\"): they were storm shutters, used only at night and in poor weather. To open the building in the morning, each ama-do would be slid along to the end of groove, where they were stacked in a box called a to- bukuroterminal \\"-do\\" and initial \\"to-\\" are the same word, see (Êà∏Ë¢ã, „Å®„Å∂„Åè„Çç: literally, \\"door-container\\"). The to-bukuro might be designed to swing out of the way. The inner two grooves remained as they were, but both could now be filled with sh≈çji, doubling the number of sh≈çji in a building. Lightweight sh≈çji could be lifted out and carried away easily. This new structure allowed the entire side of the building to be opened, giving either twice as much light, from an uninterrupted wall of shoji, or an unobstructed view of the garden; gardens changed accordingly. Run-around engawa porches meant that to- bukuro were initially located at the corners, but amado-rotator systems (amado-mawashi) were devised to eliminate this need (see images, and external movie). Amado were rotated at corners around a fixed vertical bar called a tomawashi-bou (later reduced to a pair of pegs by removing the middle section). By the mid-1600s, single-track ama-do had spread, and the ama-do might be placed on the outside of the engawa. Some further architectural changes were made under the influence of the change in shuttering. Shuttering was part of a combination of architectural changes marked the end of the shoin style, and the beginning of the sukiya style. Influence Nippon Tea House at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 During the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, a small Nippon Tea House was built near the North pond that was designed in a loose version of the sukiya-style.Stewart (2002), p73 Harper's Weekly, a national magazine, ran an article in March 1893 showing the construction of the Japanese contributions to the exhibition. The Chicago-based magazine Inland Architect also devoted two articles to it in the winter of 1892/3 so it is likely that local architects were familiar with the work.Nute (1993), p53‚Äì55 The historian Dmitri Tselos first identified the Nippon Tea House as a possible influence on Frank Lloyd Wright, suggesting that the low-pitched double roof forms of the Prairie Houses as having similar forms as the teahouse roof.Nute (1993), p67 In 1934 in his Okada residence, the architect Sutemi Horiguchi blended elements of the sukiya-style (influenced from the Katsura Detached Palace) in the garden to help fuse western and oriental aspects of the plan.Stewart (2002), p129 In 1954 Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus visited Katsura Detached Palace and was so struck by it that in 1960 he co-authored Katsura: Tradition and Creation Japanese Architecture with Kenzo Tange. > Most characteristic of the spirit of the conception is the path to the > entrance gate of the villa.

Biography Sparkman was raised in Mulberry, Florida, the oldest of three sons of a high school principal and a furniture company executive. Sparkman was an altar boy as a child. In high school, he wrote for the local weekly newspaper, The Mulberry Press, and was the football team manager. An Eagle Scout, he worked for the Boy Scouts of America as an adult, overseeing the programs in Polk and Hillsborough counties. This work later took him to Atlanta, Georgia, then London, Kentucky in 1993. Once in Kentucky he raised his adopted son alone, joined a local Methodist Church, and for nine years worked at an elementary school as a volunteer and instructional assistant. In 2005 Sparkman began part-time work with the United States Census Bureau and studied education with Western Governors University, an online college. In 2007, after medical treatment of an ingrown toe nail, Sparkman's doctor identified a cyst which led to his diagnosis of Stage-3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer. He continued teaching while receiving chemotherapy treatments from November 2007 to March 2008, during which time he completed his academic coursework and was invited to speak at the commencement ceremony at Western Governors University in Salt Lake City, Utah. After graduation he pursued a position as a middle school math teacher. Discovery of the body Sparkman's body was discovered on September 12, 2009 by attendees of a family reunion paying a visit to Hoskins Cemetery in rural Clay County, Kentucky within Daniel Boone National Forest. He had been reported missing from work three days earlier while working on the American Community Survey for the U.S. Census, covering a local five county area. Sparkman was reportedly found with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree while in contact with the ground, wearing only socks, with the word \\"fed\\" written on his chest in felt-tip marker. It was reported in the media that the word had been written upside- downPolice: Ky. census worker staged death as homicide or from an upside-down point of viewUS census worker death 'suicide' and therefore, the police eventually concluded, by Sparkman himself. His census ID was taped to the side of his neck. He was gagged, with duct tape around his hands and feet and over his mouth and eyes. Kentucky State Police criticized many media reports of the death, such as asserting that he was hanging from a tree when he was actually tied to a tree with a rope around his neck. Cause of death Authorities eventually determined that Sparkman's death was a suicide, staged to look like a homicide. Initially, police said that Sparkman's death was not natural, but hadn't ruled whether it was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident. After an investigation lasting more than two weeks by the Kentucky State Police, Sparkman's 19-year-old son, Josh Sparkman, expressed frustration and called it \\"disrespectful\\" that suicide or accident were still being considered. In the ensuing days, Sparkman's son further said he was certain the death was a homicide, noting his father's truck had been \\"ransacked\\" with items stolen, such as Sparkman's census laptop and a family wedding ring, items not discovered by investigators. Preliminary findings of the local coroner indicated Sparkman died from asphyxiation, and the Census Bureau's regional office in Charlotte, North Carolina said law enforcement called it \\"an apparent homicide\\". On October 6, Sparkman's body was released to his family, but the State Medical Examiner's Office stated it was not resolving the case. It had only established the cause of death, not the manner of death, and it was still learning \\"bits and pieces of information\\". The Kentucky State Police agreed the case was \\"perplexing\\". The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"the case so far is notable for the lack of details divulged by law enforcement officials\\". In late October, officials reported the case was close to resolution and they were careful in \\"not rushing a decision\\". John Berry, director of the Office of Personnel Management, stated his resolve to \\"come down on these perpetrators as hell hath no fury.\\" On November 23, investigators declared the death a suicide. According to reports, Sparkman, who had previously battled non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was suspected to have believed his cancer had returned, and just prior to his death had taken out life insurance policies totalling $600,000Police: Ky. census worker staged death as homicide which would have been paid to his financially struggling son in the event of death and which would not pay out for suicide or death from cancer. Census impact Regional Director Wayne Hatcher of the Census Bureau's Charlotte, N.C. regional office, which has jurisdiction over a five- state area that includes Kentucky, held a small memorial service at the cemetery in Clay County on October 11. He said other employees had reacted to the death by requesting to work in teams during census gathering. While law enforcement conducted its investigation of the death, the United States Census Bureau suspended its work in Clay County. Media reaction Because of Sparkman's status as a Federal Census Bureau worker and the word \\"fed\\" written on his body, the incident drew national attention. On MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Maddow speculated that a dislike among area residents of the U.S. federal government may have contributed to Sparkman's death. Some scholars disagreed, saying there isn't \\"an outpouring of anti-government sentiment in the region\\" and that \\"distrust of government\\" in the area is comparable to the rest of the country. However, an Associated Press report stated the area \\"has a reputation for mistrusting government, dating back to the days of moonshiners and 'revenuers'\\", and that it is a top marijuana producer where federal agents have held drug and corruption raids numerous times. Among those convicted for drug and corruption charges locally were a former mayor, former city councilmen, an assistant police chief, a county clerk, a magistrate, an election commissioner, the county's school superintendent, and circuit court judge were indicted for voter fraud in March 2009. The Christian Science Monitor also reported on possible connections to nearby drug activities and anti-government motives. Clay County is one of the poorest counties in the United States and residents feared the incident would add to its negative stereotype, despite progress in education and efforts against crime. Some suggested Sparkman's death may have been related to controversies over the upcoming 2010 federal census. Earlier in 2009 several leading conservatives and Republican political figures spoke out against ACORN's involvement in census surveys and boycotted it over concerns that the census could be used against citizens. Some libertarians faulted the census for contributing to the expanding government and Latino activists boycotted it to push for immigration reform. The Los Angeles Times reported that in the absence of public findings by investigators, some writers in the liberal blogosphere concluded that the death was the result of anti-government rhetoric during the presidency of Barack Obama. The Kentucky State Police, which conducted the investigation, noted that there had been wide misinformation and speculation from the media coverage of the incident. Robert Stivers, the Republican state senator from Clay County, said Sparkman's death had been \\"sensationalized\\" because of his status as a federal census worker. In late October, the KSP commander in charge of the case said baseless media speculation \\"has been a detriment to the investigation\\" by requiring investigators to examine those claims. On December 11, an episode of the TV show Law & Order entitled \\"FED\\" featured a murder victim based on Sparkman, found shirtless with the word \\"FED\\" written on his chest. However, this victim was a conservative campaign employee who was plotting against an ACORN-like organization. Family reaction Sparkman's son, Josh, was adamant that his father did not die by suicide.John Jeremiah Sullivan. \\"American Grotesque\\", GQ, January 2010. He said a man who fights cancer as long as Sparkman had does not take his own life, after showing the fight to live every day.

Cranbury Park, near Winchester Political career Dummer was the son of Thomas Lee Dummer. On his father's death in October 1765, he succeeded him to the family estate at Cranbury Park near Winchester, Hampshire as well as estates at Weston and Netley, near Southampton and at Horninghold in Leicestershire. He also took his father's parliamentary seat at Newport. In 1768, he lost his seat to Hans Sloane who was in the patronage of the influential Hans Stanley. In 1769, he became M.P. for nearby Yarmouth (1769‚Äì1774). Originally, the election was in favour of William Strode and Jervoise Clarke, but on petition the election was reversed in favour of Dummer and Major General the Hon. George Lane Parker. In the 1774 election, Dummer stood for election at Downton in Wiltshire. He and Thomas Duncombe were initially declared the victors, but on petition it was decided that they had not been duly elected and their opponents, John Cooper and Sir Philip Hales, were declared elected in their place. The following year, he was elected to represent Wendover in Buckinghamshire before returning to Hampshire in 1780 as M.P. for Lymington until his death in 1781. In May 1773, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Cranbury Park The Castle, Cranbury Park. Built from fragments of the north transept of Netley Abbey moved to Cranbury Park in the 1760s. On his father's death in 1765, Dummer inherited the family estate at Cranbury Park. In 1770, he purchased the City Cross (also known as the Buttercross) from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re- erected at Cranbury. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who \\"organised a small riot\\" and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a lath and plaster facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather. Undaunted by his failure to acquire the City Cross to grace the estate, Dummer turned his attention to the ruins of Netley Abbey, which he also owned, and moved the north transept of the abbey to Cranbury Park, where it can be still be seen as a folly in the gardens of the house (at ). The ruins comprise an arch, the base of a pillar, and a scaled-down gateway tower. The rear of the gateway has been made into a keeper's lodge, and is known to the village of Otterbourne as \\"the Castle\\" and is marked as such on the Ordnance Survey map. Thomas Dummer died without heirs in 1781, leaving his property at Cranbury and Netley and also at Horninghold in Leicestershire first to his widow, Harriet, daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet of Parham, with reversion to his lifelong friend Thomas Chamberlayne. Harriet Dummer then married Thomas Chamberlayne, and after his death she married the artist Nathaniel Dance in 1790.George Edward Cokayne, editor, The Complete Baronetage, 5 volumes (no date (c. 1900); reprint, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 1983), volume I, page 156.

It is the first single from their 1987 eponymous debut album. The song was written by guitarist Teddy Diaz and C. Fineza, and produced by Jose Mari Gonzales. It was engineered by Oscar Mallari, and mixed by Joseph Roxas and Bob Guzman. Background \\"Enveloped Ideas\\" is the band's signature song along with \\"Salamat\\" and \\"Iisang Bangka Tayo\\". The lyrics in the first verse are: \\"Trying pointlessly to understand, having nothing to say, just shadows, what remained boxed inside, this is what i call my enveloped ideas\\". The independently- released single was initially played as a demo at the Manila-based radio station DWXB. Listener reaction to the single was so positive, The Dawn became a byword in Pinoy rock music. The song has been certified gold by OctoArts International. This song won over a large and loyal followership for the band in 1986 when the demo version was played on the seminal radio station DWXB 102.7, and on the strength of that, they managed to snag a recording contract with OctoArts International. It seemed like they didn‚Äôt have to suffer too much through the requisite period as starving artists as the band's manager Martin Galan recalls: \\"There was that year\\", but all things considered, a year seems inconsequential, given that the band went from small venues and house parties to playing the Metropolitan Theater in about that amount of time. David Gonzales at Allmusic describes this song as 'enigmatic'. The song started with Pablo Molina singing a slow melodic line in an operatic manner, accompanied by funereal organ chords. Peppy, spirited keyboard lines jump in, and the song is kickstarted to a lively, highly melodic tune, with a synthesizer riff. The song also features a guitar solo by Teddy Diaz.

The cache consists of a Viking Age sword, an axe head, and a bar of undetermined use (possibly a part of a shield). It has been claimed by some that the relics are proof of the early Norse occupation in northern Ontario. While the authenticity of the fragments is not generally disputed, the \\"discovery\\" is generally considered to be a hoax. In the 1930s, the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) purchased the relics from the man who supposedly unearthed them. For about twenty years they were prominently displayed by the museum; however, the museum was forced to pull the relics from display following a public enquiry in about 1956‚Äì1957. About this time, the son of the supposed discoverer admitted that his father had planted the relics. The provincial museum re-introduced the relics to public display in the 1990s.A silhouette of the Beardmore Relics. Supposed discovery On 3 December 1936, James Edward Dodd, an amateur prospector and CNR trainman from Port Arthur, Ontario, sold a cache of iron fragments to Charles Trick Currelly, curator of the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) for a price of $500 CAD.Logan 2003: pp. 96‚Äì97. The cache consisted of a broken sword, an axehead, and a bar of unknown use. Dodd claimed that he had unearthed the fragments while prospecting for gold, southwest of Beardmore, Ontario, on 24 May 1931.Colombo 1988: pp. 125‚Äì127. According to one version of events, Dodd took the fragments home, thinking they were Indian relics. For a while he kept them in his woodshed, until word of his discovery reached Currelly in Toronto. Currelly accepted Dodd's account, examined the fragments, and was convinced of their authenticity. He sent photographs of them to experts in Europe, who confirmed that they were genuine Norse artifacts. After his purchase of the fragments, Currelly had them displayed in the ROM. Around this time, James Watson Curran, editor of The Sault Ste. Marie Star, stated that the find was proof of a Norse burial in the region. Curran lectured widely on the theme \\"A Norseman died in Ontario nine hundred years ago\\" and published a book on the subject.Colombo 1999: p. 46. Mowat's proposed explanation Beardmore, and Kensington, in relation to Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Lake Nipigon. The Canadian author Farley Mowat, in his Westviking (first published in 1965), speculated that the Beardmore relics, and the Kensington Runestone, were proof of Norse occupation in the region of Ontario and parts of Minnesota. The Kensington Runestone is said to have been found near Kensington, Minnesota, United States by a Swedish American farmer in 1898. It consists of a slab of rock with alleged runes carved into it.Holman 2009: pp. 160‚Äì161. The runestone is considered by runologists and Scandinavian language scholars to be a hoax; yet its authenticity is believed by some amateur researchers and locals alike. Mowat considered it likely that the Norse had established a base in the Hudson Strait and that from there could have sailed down into Hudson Bay, further south into James Bay and landed somewhere near the mouth of the Albany River. From this possible landfall, Mowat speculated that an expedition could have traveled by boat to a location near Lake Nipigon. Mowat proposed that such an expedition could have been led by Paul Knutson and that the runes upon the Kensington Runestone related to the death of ten of his followers. Mowat proposed that the Beardmore relics were the remains of a burial and that the Kensington Runestone was originally engraved and left somewhere near the area as the expedition made a hasty northeasterly retreat. He proposed that the runestone could have been found by Indians and later carried off to Minnesota.Mowat 1990: pp. 369‚Äì370.  Scepticism  Immediately after the Royal Ontario Museum's purchase of the \\"relics\\", Canadian archaeologists and others were dismayed at the museum's endorsement of the fragments, noting discrepancies in Dodd's statements, as well of those of his friends and enemies. Dodd had altered his account several times. John Robert Colombo wrote that ‚ÄúArchaeologists accused Dodd of fraud, suggesting he had purchased the artifacts from an immigrant from Norway and then ‚Äòsalted‚Äô them for later ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô. Amid considerable controversy, the Royal Ontario Museum withdrew the artifacts from public display, and for more than thirty years would routinely refuse permission to reproduce photographs of the relics.‚Äù In 1956 or 1957 Walter Dodd, son of James Edward Dodd, submitted a sworn statement that his father had found the relics in the basement of a house at 33 Machar Street, Port Arthur; that he saw his father plant the relics at the site of the supposed discovery; and that his earlier statement had been made \\"under pressure\\" from his father. Until this point the Royal Ontario Museum had defended the authenticity of the relics and of their supposed discovery. Amid considerable controversy, and following a public enquiry, the museum withdrew the relics from display. According to American anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, during the twenty-five years between the supposed discovery and the son's admission, successive museum directors and staff members knew much of the 'true' history of the relics. Carpenter stated that the staff knew the collection where the fragments and even knew the name of the ship on which they reached Canada. According to historian F. Donald Logan, the fragments appear to have been imported from Scandinavia in about 1923. They ended up in the Port Arthur area, which had a sizable Norwegian population. It is reported that for more than 30 years museum curators refused to allow photographs to be taken of the fragments and that in the 1990s the museum re-introduced the relics to public display.

A spike is performed when the offensive team is conducting a hurried drive near the end of the half, and the game clock is still running after the previous play; as an incomplete pass the spike causes the referee to stop the game clock, and the offensive team will have a chance to huddle and plan the next play without losing scarce game-clock time, particularly if said team has no timeouts remaining or is trying to save any remaining timeouts. A spike is not considered intentional grounding if it is done with the quarterback under center and immediately after the snap. No penalty is assessed. Running a spike play presumes there will be at least one play by the same team immediately afterward, so it would not be done on fourth down; instead, a regular play would have to be run without a huddle. In the 1998 Rose Bowl, Ryan Leaf spiked the ball and inadvertently ran the clock out on that play. In the 2012 Rose Bowl, Russell Wilson also ran the clock out on a spike play. In both cases, just before such spike, the clock was stopped with just 2 seconds left (while the sideline chains were being moved for 1st down, the usual procedure when playing under college football rules). In 2014, Nick Montana spiked the ball on 4th down near the end of the first half of a game between his Tulane University and UCF, resulting in a turnover on downs; he erroneously believed his team had gained a first down. In Canadian football, spike plays are legal but very rare. This is mainly because a final play is always run whenever the game clock expires while the ball is dead, rendering spike plays unnecessary. Also, the offense in Canadian football only receives three downs instead of four. Spiking after scoring After scoring a touchdown, players at the professional level often celebrate by spiking the football. In NCAA football, the scoring player is immediately obligated to either leave the ball or return the ball to an official - spiking the ball in this circumstance is illegal and will result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.2008 NCAA FOOTBALL RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS , National Collegiate Athletic Association, Page 112, Accessed August 4, 2008. Spiking the ball remains legal in the NFL, where it is not interpreted as excessive celebration unless the ball is spiked towards another player on the opposing team. The maneuver is attributed to Homer Jones of the New York Giants in 1965. Such action is not considered a \\"spike play\\" as the ball is dead once the touchdown has been scored. It has no official status. \\"Gronk Spike\\" Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski has been credited in resurrecting the spiking as a touchdown celebration and making it his own. His signature \\"Gronk Spike\\" has been a product of the less restrictive scoring celebrations of the NFL compared to high school and college, and debuted on September 26, 2010 after scoring his second NFL touchdown. It had become a fan phenomenon with MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference calculating that Gronkowski's arm moves 130¬∞ with the football leaving his hand at delivering 650 lbs. of force (2,900 N).

The film is loosely based on the actions of the high-ranking KGB official, Vladimir Vetrov. It was released in the United States in June 2010. It was adapted from the book Bonjour Farewell: La v√©rit√© sur la taupe fran√ßaise du KGB (1997) by Serguei Kostine. Plot In the early 1980s, a high-ranking KGB analyst, Sergei Grigoriev, disillusioned with the Soviet regime, decides to pass Soviet secrets, including a list of their spies, to the government of France, then under the newly elected President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a Socialist in coalition with the Communist Party. Grigoriev (code-named Farewell by the French intelligence service) hopes to force change in the Soviet Union by revealing their extensive network of spies trying to acquire scientific, technical and industrial information from the West. He uses Pierre Froment, a na√Øve French engineer based in Moscow, as his unlikely intermediary. After the first transfer of information, Pierre confides in his wife Jessica, who is adamant about his stopping this activity in order to safeguard their family. Grigoriev persuades Pierre to continue without telling Jessica. He will accept neither money nor defection as a reward, but sometimes requests small gifts from Pierre's trips to France, such as a Sony Walkman and Queen cassette tapes for his son, some cognac, or books of French poetry. As Farewell's prodigious output blossoms, the French are bewildered by the sheer scale and yield of top Western technology transferred covertly to the Soviets. Under suspicion that he is not a trustworthy ally, Mitterrand personally hands U.S. President Ronald Reagan a dossier of invaluable Farewell data during the Ottawa G7 summit. The Americans are astounded with it and other information provided by Farewell, culminating in the full \\"List X\\" of Soviet spies within the highest echelons of the Western scientific and industrial apparatus. They embark on an ambitious plan to feed the Soviets erroneous or defective data; shortly afterwards, the network of Soviet technology spies in the West is rolled up, and Reagan announces the \\"Star Wars\\" antimissile shield project. Deprived of hi-tech information from the West, and with their own laboratories falling behind, the Soviet leadership panics. Seeing this desperate impasse for what it is, Mikhail Gorbachev, then an upwards-mobile party official, starts preparing the reform policies he is to pursue in the future. Grigoriev's superior, a double agent for the CIA, is directed by them to sacrifice Grigoriev and save the Froments, all unbeknownst to the French. Grigoriev, under arrest and KGB interrogation, plays dumb to give the Froments time to escape. They cover their tracks and flee by car to the Finnish border. While in West Germany for debriefing, Pierre pleads with the CIA Director to save Grigoriev, praising his integrity and selflessness. The director refuses as a policy principle, having brought the other agent to the West. Grigoriev is granted his request of execution by a marksman on the jetty of the snow- clad lake he loves. Pierre is later offered a company job in Manhattan.

Its blue-purple flowers appear in spring and early summer (September to December), and it is pollinated by insects such as butterflies and bees. Adapting readily to cultivation, Dampiera purpurea is grown as a garden plant in Australia. Taxonomy The prolific botanist Robert Brown described Dampiera purpurea in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Its species name is the Latin adjective purpureus \\"purple\\". Description Dampiera purpurea is an erect multi-stemmed plant to high with obovate to elliptic leaves which are long and wide. The stems and undersides of leaves are covered in fine hair and rough in texture, while the leaves are bare of hair when mature. The flowers are mainly produced between August and January in the species' native range. Three to five flowers arise each on groups of two to nine flower-bearing branches. Reaching in diameter, they are generally blue-purple in colour with yellow centres, though pink and white flowers have been recorded. Distribution and habitat Dampiera purpurea occurs in sclerophyll forest and heath in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. In the Sydney region, it is found under such trees as smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia), red bloodwood (C. gummifera), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis), monkey gum (E. cypellocarpa), silvertop ash (E. sieberi), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), predominantly on sandstone-based soils but sometimes also clay soils, and generally in places with good drainage. the annual rainfall is 800 to 1600 mm. Ecology Dampiera purpurea is killed by bushfire, with new shoots arising from ground level. These can then flower in ten months, peaking around two to three years after a fire. It also regenerates by seed from fire. Butterflies of the families Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae and European honeybees forage at the flowers, and are likely pollinators. Cultivation Dampiera purpurea can be grown in cool to subtropical climates. It is a variable species, reflected by the many forms in cultivation. Preferring a lightly shaded position, it also adapts to full sun and has some frost tolerance. It is adaptable to most reasonably drained soils but is more vigorous in heavier soils. Best results are obtained through a steady supply of moisture in spring and summer, though it will withstand dry periods once established. A light pruning after flowering keeps plants in shape. Plants can be propagated by cuttings or division.

This word has assumed two meanings, both of which are essentially a pun based on the similarity of the sound of the words \\"copy\\" and \\"cope\\" with copia. In the field of neurology, dyscopia is used to describe a type of developmental coordination disorder related to dyslexia and dysgraphia (inability to read or write). Specifically, it is taken to mean difficulty with copying. Sometimes a similar word, \\"acopia\\", is mistaken to mean the same,Journal of altered states of consciousness, Volume 4 although this is not a medical term and has no basis in Latin. The term \\"dyscopia\\" has also crept into general medical parlance as a tongue-in-cheek shorthand notation for patients who, after being examined and found to have no specific medical condition, are deemed to be not coping with certain aspects of their lives, and are presumed to be seeking treatment as a form of comfort from the medical profession. More recently, and controversially, the term has been used in this context as a diagnosis for admission to hospital. The words have also been used in medical notes as a cryptic indication that certain members of a seriously ill patient's family are not coping with the situation and should be afforded some extra consideration to their feelings when the case is being discussed. As dystranscribia In neurology, the word \\"dyscopia\\" is used to describe a condition which is common as one of the sequelae of cerebral commisurotomy, a neurosurgical procedure in which the left and right hemispheres of the brain are separated by severing the corpus callosum. This procedure has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in extreme cases of epilepsy. An affected individual will exhibit difficulty with copying simple line drawings. This is often accompanied to lesser or greater degree by difficulty with writing and other fine motor skills. As 'not coping' in medical usage Terms such as \\"social admission\\", \\"atypical presentation\\", and even the derogatory terms \\"bed blocker\\" or \\"crumblie\\" \\"‚ÄòAcopia‚Äô and ‚Äòsocial admission‚Äô are not diagnoses: why older people deserve better\\" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 2008: 101: 168‚Äì174 have been used in medical notes synonymously with dyscopia or acopia as a reason for hospital admission. The use of the term has become sufficiently commonplace in medical notes that a recent publication of a psychiatric dictionary even cites it as an actual diagnosis.Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary Patients who are likely to be labelled with one of these terms are sometimes frail and elderly or people with long-term disabilities. Their failure to cope is often a result of inadequate social support coupled with a deterioration of functional capability which is not clearly linked to an obvious or specific medical or psychiatric pathology. Sometimes, however, despite the fact that terms such as acopia and social admission can be considered tongue-in-cheek by those adhering to the strictest of medical and psychiatric terminology, they can frequently describe a range of \\"symptoms\\", such as extreme lability and emotionality when demands are not met and the unwillingness of a minority of patients that might be encountered in psychiatry, to function and make ends meet, despite the fact that such patients might be lucid and able-bodied. A possible controversy associated with using dyscopia and acopia as diagnoses could arise when wrongfully applied to those who have genuine problems with mobility; genuine medical conditions may be overlooked. Investigation of symptoms is a legitimate reason for admission, and if medical staff are too swift to dismiss concerns by use of such informal labels, genuine symptoms may not be taken seriously and investigated. This may lead to treatable conditions being overlooked, and in turn, result in compromised quality of life and unnecessary suffering. Dyscopia (and likewise acopia), in this context, is not generally used by the medical community for fear of insulting the patient and bringing the caregiver's professional standing into question. Colloquial usage Acopia has been adopted as the name of a company based in Crawley, UK, presumably referring the correct Latin root of the word copia meaning abundance. The words also appear to be gaining traction in common usage as colloquialisms meaning emotional lability over trivial events or circumstances. This may well assist in demystifying the term and discouraging its usage in medical circles.

He is believed to be the first American to engage in aerial combat in the war. He was the first to fly up the East River under all four bridges. Early life He was born on August 12, 1893 to Benjamin Thaw, Sr. He learned to fly in 1913, while he was attending Yale University. His father bought him a Curtiss Hydro flying boat that he took to France for the Schneider Trophy races. When war broke out, Thaw gave his airplane to the French and enlisted in the Foreign Legion. Military career He joined Escadrille 6. He then became a corporal in Escadrille 42 in 1915, flying a Caudron. He flew a Nieuport in Escadrille 65, before transferring into a French unit composed of American volunteers, known as the Escadrille Americaine, Escadrille 124 under its new designation became nicknamed the Lafayette Escadrille. Thaw scored his first victory using a Nieuport on 24 May 1916. His next kill was on 27 April 1917. He had two unconfirmed claims in late 1917. He was transferred to the United States Army Air Service, where he commanded the 103rd Aero Squadron and the 3rd Pursuit Group. He would score three quick wins in April and May 1918. His final tally was one enemy observation balloon and four airplanes shot down. Thaw has been credited with purchasing the Escadrille's famed pet male lion \\"Whiskey\\". Purchased by several pilots for 500 francs, the lion was adopted by the unit as a sort of mascot. Eventually Whiskey and a female lion purchased by the Escadrille \\"Soda\\" were taken to a Paris Zoo (ref. Air & Space, January 2015), but still remembered the pilot. In one visit, the lions rolled over on their backs in their cage in order to allow Thaw to pet them.Gibbons, Floyd, Death From Above, Weston County (Upton, WY) Gazette, June 4, 1936, column 3, p. 6 Final years He married Marjorie Everts on March 2, 1921.

They were the last team to hold the titles when WCCW merged with the Continental Wrestling Association to form the USWA and, as a result, he and Cactus Jack were recognized as the first tag team champions in the new promotion. Career=World Class Championship Wrestling (1988-1990) Braddock began wrestling for promoter Fritz von Erich in World Class Championship Wrestling around 1988. In mid-1989, he became a member of manager Robert Fuller's \\"Stud Stable\\", which included \\"Rotten\\" Ron Starr and Cactus Jack, and became involved in a heated feud with Matt Borne and Jeff Jarrett. He and Cactus Jack, later stablemates in Skandor Akbar's Devastation Inc., began teaming together eventually winning the WCWA World Tag Team Championship from Borne and Jarrett in Dallas, Texas on August 4, 1989. This was the last WCCW event held at the Dallas Sportatorium. During that time, both WCCW and the CWA merged to form the United States Wrestling Alliance. Braddock and Cactus Jack were recognized by the USWA as the promotion's first tag team champions before losing the titles back to Borne and Jarrett a week later. Braddock won the titles once more, this time with Ron Starr, defeating them in Dallas on September 15. The title was held up in a September 22 rematch with he and Starr losing the titles to Borne and Jarrett the following week. The feud ended after Borne lost a \\"Loser-Leaves-Town\\" match in November. Jarrett briefly found an ally in a young Jeff Gaylord, but found more success as a singles wrestler. That same year, he wrestled Jimmy Jack Funk in one of the earliest shows aired on \\"USWA on ESPN\\" from the Dallas Sportatorium.

United States Wrestling Association (1990-1992) Since the start of 1989, Braddock was one of the WCCW veterans used primarily in \\"USWA Texas\\". Like most of the roster however, Braddock would eventually spend much of the next year traveling to and from Dallas and Memphis as the promotion focused on those two areas. One of his earliest matches in Memphis was a 6-man tag team match with Jeff Gaylord and PY Chu Hi against Jimmy Jack Funk, Chico Torres and Chris Adams on January 13, 1990. He also faced, and lost, to Junkyard Dog in Alexandria, Louisiana on January 30. During the next month, Braddock and Gaylord faced Jimmy Jack Funk in tag team matches with Dustin Rhodes and Dutch Mantel. On February 23, Sheik Braddock returned to Dallas where he beat Chico Torres at the Sportatorium. He participated in the main event later that night by teaming with John Tatum, Gary Young and Chris Youngblood to defeat Torres, Jimmy Jack Funk, Dutch Mantell and Kevin Von Erich in an 8-man tag team match. Braddock then went back to Memphis where he and Chris Youngblood unsuccessfully challenged then USWA Tag Team Champions The Southern Rockers (Steve Doll & Rex King). By early-1990, Braddock himself left the tag team division to become a singles wrestler and became one of many veteran brawlers to join manager Skandor Akbar's \\"heel\\" stable Devastation Inc. Braddock frequently teamed with \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin during his feud against Chris Adams. They were occasionally joined by Jeff Gaylord in 6-man tag team matches which included a televised bout against Adams, Matt Borne and Eric Embry on March 16.Braddock, Scott, Steve Austin, Jeff Gaylord, Eric Embry, Chris Adams, and Matt Borne, perf.

In Memphis, Braddock had better luck managing a title shot against USWA Southern Champion \\"Superstar\\" Bill Dundee on June 10. He also formed a regular team with Jeff Gaylord, who were known as The Wild Things, and challenged Rex King & Joey Maggs for the USWA Tag Team Championship on July 14. Later joined by manager Downtown Bruno, the tag team also faced Ben Jordan & Ken Raper, King Cobra & Big Red, and Kowabunga & Ken Wayne whom they fought to a double-countout at the Mid-South Coliseum on July 30. Braddock also racked up an impressive string of victories over Jeff Jarrett, Ben Jordan and Rex King during this time.

His last year in wrestling was spent in Big D. Pro Wrestling, where he wrestled as \\"Scotty The Body Braddock\\", and retired after the promotion closed at the end of the year.

In 1997 it was suggested that the Collybia genus be split into three genera, one of them being Gymnopus.  Description  In general, Gymnopus fruiting bodies are found in leaf and woody litter. Typically the fruiting bodies are relatively small and range from browns to white in color. Their spore deposit is white. Most species of gymnopus act as decomposers (saprotrophic). With one known exception (G. subnudus), the mating patterns of gymnopus all seem to be bifactorial, meaning that there is more than one locus responsible for regulating mating compatibility.

He studied at the University of Debrecen until 1938, then worked at the Physiological and General Pathological Institute of the university. In 1948 he was appointed director of the Pathophysiological Institute of Debrecen, a post which he held until his death. During his directorship the institute became the research center of immunology in Hungary. Antibodies to muscle proteins were first prepared by Keszty≈±s and his team; they also studied the reaction of these antibodies with the muscle protein antigens. During the early period of his career he studied - together with Istv√°n Went - antibodies and flavins, on the ground of their researches they could successfully produce immunizer pharmaceutical drugs used as treatment for allergies. Later he investigated the relationship between nervous system and immunity, and stated that despite the neurological understanding being in force at that time the nervous system doesn't impact either on production of antibodies, or on anaphylaxis. He was a corresponding (1967), then a full member (1976) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the founder and first chairman of the Hungarian Immunological Society (1971).

It is named after a Swiss mycologist Jacob Gabriel Trog. The genus contains about 20 species that are widely distributed in tropical areas. Taxonomy The genus was first circumscribed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1835. He set the type species as Trogia montagnei, a species that had been described by French mycologist Camille Montagne in 1834 as Cantharellus aplorutis. The type has since been lost, and as a result, there has been some historical disagreement as to the boundaries of the genus. The British botanist Edred John Henry Corner emended the genus in 1966 to include 56 species. Rolf Singer disagreed with this broad species concept in the fourth edition of his Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy (1986), and only included three species: T. cantharelloides, T. buccinalis, and T. montagnei. He considered most of the species included by Corner as better placed in genera like Hemimycena, Mycena, Gerronema, Hydropus, and Hymenogloea. Corner later defended his species concept in a 1991 publication.Corner, E.J.H. (1991). Trogia (Basidiomycetes). Gardens‚Äô Bulletin, Singapore. Supplement 2:1‚Äì97 Description The genus contains species with clitocyboid (gilled mushrooms that lack partial veils and feature white, yellowish, or pinkish spore prints) to omphalinoid (mushroom with a decurrent gill attachment, a cartilage-like stem, a broad or depressed cap surface and lacking a ring and volva) fruit body types. The fruit bodies are tough when dry, but can revive when moistened. They grow on rotting wood or woody material. Distribution Species in the genus are found in tropical and subtropical areas. Trogia cantharelloides (Mont.) Pat. is a widespread neotropical species, recorded from Puerto Rico, and Cuba among other places. Uses As a wood-rotting fungus genus, species of Trogia have enzymes that break down lignin, a complex polysaccharide that is largely responsible for giving wood its strength. Trogia buccinalis has been investigated for its ability to use these enzymes to break down common pollutant molecules such as anthracene, pentachlorophenol, and polyvinylchloride. Yunnan Sudden Death Syndrome One species, Trogia venenata, colloquially known as \\"little white\\" has been implicated in the deaths of around 400 people in Yunnan province, southwestern China. Appearing after local rainfall, the mushrooms contain toxic amino acids and seem to be cardiotoxic in susceptible people, causing fatal arrhythmia. The amino acids are not used in proteins, and one is new to science, According to taxonomist Yang Zhuliang, Trogia was not previously thought to contain poisonous species. A team led by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist Zeng Guang suggested that the element barium, present in local foods and contaminated water, may increase the toxicity of the Trogia mushroom. This has been disproved by later studies.

In this story, the character is the alien Tlano from the planet Zur-En- Arrh.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvoZPTbPekc Publication history The first appearance of the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. Illustrated by Dick Sprang. Batman of Zur-En-Arrh first appeared in Batman #113 (February 1958), in a story titled \\"Batman‚ÄîThe Superman of Planet-X!\\". It was written by France Herron and drawn by Dick Sprang. In the story, Tlano, the Batman from Zur-En- Arrh, brings Earth's Batman to his planet to help him battle giant robots piloted by an unidentified alien race. While on the planet, Earth's Batman discovers he has \\"Superman-like\\" powers through similar means of the Superman of his world. The end of the story leaves it ambiguous to the reader whether Batman's adventure was real or a dream. 2000s When Grant Morrison took over the Batman series in September 2006, he began referencing classic moments from the character's career, including using a version of Bat-Mite and reusing a costume and dialogue from the then-fifty-year-old Batman #156. Among the references was the \\"Zur-En-Arrh\\" phrase, which appears on an alley wall and again on a dumpster in Batman #655 and continues to appear, usually as a background element graffiti, until the Batman R.I.P. story arc begins. The story reveals that the \\"Zur-En-Arrh\\" persona is a backup personality created by Bruce Wayne in the event he was ever mentally compromised. The Zur-En-Arrh personality is shown to be more violent and unhinged than Batman's normal persona and is dressed in a costume out of red, yellow, and purple rags referencing the one worn by Tlano. Fictional character biography=Silver Age One night, Bruce Wayne finds himself in a daze. He dresses as Batman and takes off in the Batplane while remaining unclear of his own actions. Batman soon finds that he has been teleported to another planet called Zur-En- Arrh. There, he meets the scientist Tlano monitoring his activities on Earth and has decided to become a version of Batman for his own planet. On this planet, the Batman of Earth has enhanced abilities due to the different elements of the alien planet. The two Batmen join forces to defeat giant invading robots piloted by an unidentified alien race. After the robots are destroyed, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh gives Batman (Bruce Wayne) his Bat-Radia device as a keepsake and returns to Earth.Batman #113 Modern Age In the past, the psychiatrist Simon Hurt was hired to oversee an isolation experiment, for which Batman volunteered. During this process, he gave Bruce Wayne a post-hypnotic trigger connected to the phrase \\"Zur-En-Arrh\\", young Bruce Wayne's mishearing of his father's last words (\\"the sad thing is they'd probably throw someone like Zorro in Arkham\\").Batman #681 Many years later, Doctor Hurt was working with the Black Glove when they decided to target Batman and his allies, first spreading information to the effect that Batman's father somehow survived his murder by Joe Chill. Then, using the Zur-En-Arrh trigger in conjunction with drugs, he sent a dazed and confused Bruce Wayne onto the streets of Gotham with no memory of his life. In Batman #678, Bruce assembles a makeshift Batman costume of similar style to that worn by Tlano and declares himself \\"the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh\\". The character \\"Bat-Mite\\" appears on the last page with him, commenting \\"uh-oh\\" over Batman's increasing delusions. Bat-Mite then counsels the Zur-En-Arrh Batman, revealed over the course of the story to be a backup personality created after a hallucination Batman suffered when exposed to Professor Milo's gas. It was intended to take over for Bruce Wayne if he was ever psychologically attacked in such a manner as to render Batman out of action. The colorful costume expresses a greater confidence and demonstrates a greater willingness to torture and possibly kill his opponents; on one occasion, the Zur-En-Arrh Batman describes himself as being Batman \\"when you take Bruce out of the equation\\". Batman #680 reveals that Bat-Mite is actually a product of Batman's imagination, being Batman's rational side to prevent the unstable Zur-En-Arrh persona from going too far, although he comments that he is from the 5th dimension because \\"the fifth dimension is imagination\\".Batman #680 Costume The costumes of the two incarnations of the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh are the same, consisting of gaudy, outlandish colors. In the modern continuity, the crazed Bruce Wayne comments that, despite the ostentatiousness of the costume, Robin had dressed this way for years, implying that it reflects the \\"total confidence\\" of the Zur-En-Arrh Batman in his ability to attract the attention of his enemies whereas the Earth Batman dresses in dark colors to attack his foes in the shadows. Skills, abilities, and resources Tlano possessed much high-tech equipment, owing to his residence on a futuristic planet. His version of the Batmobile had an \\"atomic-powered\\" motor, and he flew a rocket-shaped Batplane. His main weapon was the \\"Bat-radia\\", with which he could \\"jam atmospheric molecules\\", affecting the equipment of his enemies. At the end of the story, Tlano leaves Bruce with the device, which becomes inoperable in Earth's environment. The Bruce Wayne incarnation also possesses a Bat-radia. This may or may not reflect a continuity between the two stories, as Grant Morrison has made efforts to treat Batman's entire publication history as his backstory. This version of the device scrambled security systems, for instance, overriding and confusing Arkham Asylum's, as well as serving as a tracking device to allow Batman's allies to find him. To add a note of humor to the story, the radia is presented as a \\"cheap-ass radio\\" instead of the object seen in the imaginary story, and members of the Black Glove dismiss it as such until they discover its true purpose. In other media=Film * The Modern Age version of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh appears in the Batman: Death in the Family interactive film. He appears if the viewer chooses to have Batman sacrifice himself to save Jason Todd and to have Jason initially keep his dying wish to avoid killing the Joker. Jason becomes the vigilante Red Hood and attempts to take down the Joker without killing criminals, but eventually realizes he's been slaughtering them while repressing his memories of their deaths. After the viewer chooses again whether Jason should kill the Joker or not, Red Hood becomes a wanted fugitive. Talia Al Ghul confronts Jason on top of a Wayne Industries building and offers him the chance to join the League of Assassins with a resurrected Bruce, who was brought back to life with the Lazarus Pit. However, the pit also drove him insane, leading him to don the colorful costume and causing him to only be able to say \\"Zur-En-Arrh\\". Red Hood refuses to join and fights Batman. The outcome of the fight is determined by whether the viewer chose to kill the Joker or not. Television * The Silver Age version of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Super Batman of Planet X!\\" voiced by Kevin Conroy. The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is the protector of the city of Gothtropolis (an amalgam of Gotham City and Metropolis), and is aided by his robot butler Alpha-Red. When Batman of Earth crash lands on Zur-En-Arrh, he helps the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh stop a mugger. Chancellor Gor-Zonn asks the Batmen to battle giant robots (which are based on robots that they fought in the comics) created by mad scientist Rohtul (voiced by Clancy Brown). During the fight, Batman finds that he has Superman-like powers while on Zur-En-Arrh due to the alien element rhodon. Tlano has a Clark Kent-like identity and is a reporter at the Solar Cycle Newspaper Company (Zur-En-Arrh's version of the Daily Planet), where he works with Vilsi Vaylar (an amalgam of Lois Lane and Vicki Vale, voiced by Dana Delaney). In prison, Rohtul deduces that Batman is from Earth and his powers can be counteracted with quartz. Batman of Zur-En-Arrh comes to Batman's aid and the two defeat Rohtul. The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh makes a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Night of the Batmen!\\" alongside other versions of Batman that appear at the end to assist Batman.

Variations in rapid automatized naming time in children provide a strong predictor of their later ability to read, and is independent from other predictors such as phonological awareness, verbal IQ, and existing reading skills. Importantly, rapid automatized naming of pictures and letters can predict later reading abilities for pre-literate children. History The concept of rapid automatized naming began with a study by Geshwind and Fusillo in 1966. They found some adults who suffered from a stroke were later unable to name colors despite being able to color match and having no evidence of color blindness. These individuals however were able to spell and write, indicating that their brain structures were intact and that they could generate the pathway from spoken words to visual and kinaesthetic representations. This visual-verbal disconnection led to a search for individuals who could not read and may be unable to name colors, primarily grade one students. It was found that in grade one students who could not read, color naming was possible but took much longer than color naming in children who could read. The first color naming task was located in Ruesch and Wells Mental Examiner‚Äôs Handbook (1972). It consisted of 50 squares of 5 primary colors repeated in random order 10 times. The test was originally administered as a timed continuous test at the bedside of individuals recovering from head injury. Rapid automatized naming was first identified in 1974 as predicting reading abilities in young English readers between 5‚Äì11 years of age by Martha Denckla and Rita Rudel of Columbia University. Faster times in RAN trials have been found to be a good indicator of reading competence, not only in alphabetic writing systems, but in writing systems such as Chinese logographs and Japanese kanji and hiragana. RAN testing has been shown to be effective in testing reader‚Äôs fluency in languages with orthographically transparent alphabetic scripts such as German and Dutch. Timed reading tests of poor readers of transparent orthographies show very few reading errors; their main reading problem is slow, laborious decoding for words that are automatically read by their peers. This was also found for other readers in languages with consistent orthographies such as Spanish, Italian and Dutch. English is an inconsistent orthography because it has poor letter sound correspondences. English orthography and French orthography are also inconsistent because of their use of silent letters. It has been found that continuous rapid naming of a list, compared to naming of single items, is easier for nondyslexic readers than it is for dyslexic ones. Despite this, Wimmer, Mayringer and Landerl (2000) suggest that the diagnosis of dyslexia in English readers often overlooks naming-speed deficit and that most studies rely on poor word recognition to diagnose reading disability. Types of RAN Testing Rapid automatized naming can be used in many different ways. One of its strengths is flexibility in what types of stimuli categories it uses. Different categories consist of colors, digits, objects and letters. Researchers use RAN to test orthographic interpretation and phonological awareness. Two RAN tests are the CTOPP and TOWRE. Two formats of RAN testing are used, discrete and serial testing. Serial Testing Using a serial testing method, participants are shown a row or column of symbols and must name the symbols sequentially as fast as possible. An assumption made of serial RAN testing is that it consists of two components: articulation time (the mean time it takes to articulate the symbol), and pause time (the mean length of time between naming two adjacent symbols). When referring to pause time, this can include saccadic eye movements, disengagement from previously named symbols and focusing on upcoming symbols. Discrete Testing Using the discrete testing method, participants are shown symbols individually usually on a computer screen. In discrete RAN testing each individual symbols' naming latency is measured. The naming latency consists of the mean time from presentation to articulation of symbol. It is scored using the mean naming latency of all symbols. Some theorists believe that discrete RAN testing reflects the retrieval of phonological code from memory which can also be referred to as lexical access speed. Some researchers argue that discrete testing is a better method because of individual differences in the reading speed of a list of sight words; the relationship of RAN and reading will be stronger if sight word reading speed is measured by discrete presentation.  Criticism  Today RAN is frequently used as a clinical instrument for diagnosing reading disabilities in children. It is often used to predict category membership in reading group sub-types. Some concerns with diagnosis using rapid automatized naming arise because it assesses a wide range of cognitive skills. Speed and accuracy can be influenced by many different processing mechanisms and variables, including the perceived speed of the object to be named. Another concern is identifying which cognitive mechanisms are shared with reading. It is not clear whether RAN is testing orthographic knowledge or whether it is testing phonological processing. Theories The role RAN plays in testing reading ability is contentious. Research supports the use of RAN as a measure of phonological processing, as a measure of orthographic processing and integration, and as a measure of reading ability. It has been suggested that RAN may link to reading because reading depends on object-naming circuits in the left cerebral hemisphere that are recruited in reading to underpin word-recognition abilities. Orthographic and/or Phonological Processing Little is known about the mediator variable between phonological awareness and RAN and the relationship between phonological awareness and RAN. Researchers argue that RAN tests \\"the ability to retrieve phonological representations rapidly from long-term memory\\". Part of this view consists of RAN as tapping into the phonological system by measuring the rate of retrieval of phonological information in long term memory. \\"The theoretical underpinnings being that, beyond the precision or accuracy of the grapheme‚Äìphoneme representations itself, rapid access to phonological representations is the main prerequisite to develop automaticity in reading a transparent writing system\\". Others however dispute the link between RAN testing and phonological processing. They argue that phonological awareness is more strongly related to pure decoding ability, whereas naming speed appears to be more strongly related to reading fluency. Similarly, other researchers view RAN as a sub-process of phonological awareness. In this view RAN is seen as a task that draws on accessing phonological codes for effective execution. Although the relationship between RAN and phonological awareness is monotonic, these measures do not produce uniform changes. Instead, as reading skills increase or decrease, RAN and phonological awareness skills do not change uniformly. An alternative view is that RAN plays a larger role in measuring orthographic processing. Here RAN is believed to measure processes that are important in gaining orthographic representations. Studies have been conducted where RAN has been seen to measure reading of different kinds of words. These researchers argue that \\"the relationship of RAN with reading should be higher if the reading task requires more orthographic knowledge.\\" The results of some studies tend to support this prediction as stronger relationships were found with exception word reading. Still other studies focus on the relationship between phonological processing and orthographic processing. \\"The fact that RAN as a predictor of reading and spelling was not affected by orthographic regularity seems to suggest that RAN is a compound skill that consists of several sub-processes that are related to early literacy development. These processes might very well imply both orthographical and phonological skills\\". Reading Ability There are several theories why rapid automatized naming is associated with reading abilities. One suggestion is that they both exploit the speed with which phonological representations are retrieved from long-term memory. Another related theory is that both depend on variations in the rate of development of a general cognitive speed of information processing. Evidence exists that RAN‚Äôs contribution to reading ability decreases as we age. Longitudinal studies report that the contribution of naming speed to reading skills after grade 3 diminishes, whereas the contribution of phonological awareness remains constant. The validity of RAN in measuring reading ability is based on three assumptions. First, that RAN deficits and phonological deficits are independent of one another. Secondly, the relationship between RAN and phonological awareness varies according to reading maturity. Finally, naming speed is a complex process involving processes beyond the phonological system. Labelling RAN as a measure of reading ability ignores many complexities of the task. Schatschneider et al. argue \\"that rapid naming tasks are composed of attentional, visual, lexical, temporal, and recognition sub-processes that all contribute to naming speed performance. Lumping all these sub-processes under the category of phonological processes obscures the complexity of rapid naming tasks. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the finding that naming speed tasks consistently account for variance in early reading skills beyond that accounted for by measures of phonemic awareness\\". Another viewpoint is that rapid automatized naming directly relates to differences in reading competence. Supporting this is the fact that the ability to rapidly name digits and letters predicts reading better than rapidly naming colors and objects. This suggests a difference due to differences in experience with letters. However, rapid automatized naming of colors, objects, numbers and letters measured in children before they learn to read predicts later differences in reading skill, while early differences in reading ability do not predict later differences in rapid automatized naming. Double Deficit Hypothesis It has been proposed that dyslexia is due to a \\"double-deficit hypothesis\\" in which phonological deficits and naming-speed deficits are two separate causes of reading problems, such that when they are combined, they produce a greater dyslexic defect than would be produced by either deficit individually. The double-deficit hypothesis suggests that RAN and phonological awareness operate as independent systems that are equally important in word identification. This model is based on literature showing that phonological disabilities and naming speed-deficits underlie some forms of reading disabilities. In the case of modest or severe reading disability, the concurrence of both a phonological deficit and rapid naming deficit characterizes the most difficult forms of reading disabilities. These individuals score lowest on reading measures.

There are documents evidencing the diffusion of socialist ideas since then, but these were individual initiatives with no ability to form groups with actual political activism.\\"Resumo hist√≥rico do socialismo\\" , article by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica do Brasil published on the Independent Media Center on June 24, 2004. History=Old Republic (1889‚Äì1930) In 1892 the First Socialist Congress of Brazil occurred in Rio de Janeiro. Later that year, in S√£o Paulo, another Socialist Congress, independent from the latter, took place. That same year the Workers' Socialist Party (Partido Oper√°rio Socialista) was founded in Rio de Janeiro. This is considered to be the first socialist party in Brazil. In 1895, also in Rio, the Socialist Workers Party (Partido Socialista Oper√°rio) was founded. That same year, Silv√©rio Fontes, considered the first Brazilian Marxist, launched the Socialist Center of Santos, which soon published the socialist magazine A Quest√£o Social (The Social Question) and newspaper O Socialista (The Socialist). The first major socialist party of the country was founded in 1902 in S√£o Paulo, under the auspicious of Italian immigrant Alceb√≠ades Bertollotti, who was once responsible for Avanti, the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party. That same year, the Socialist Collective Party (Partido Socialista Coletivista) was founded in Rio de Janeiro, headed by Vicente de Sousa, a teacher at the Col√©gio Pedro II, and Gustavo Lacerda, a journalist and founder of the Brazilian Press Association (Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Imprensa ‚Äì ABI). In 1906, the Independent Workers Party (Partido Oper√°rio Independente) was founded; it created a \\"popular university\\", which had Rocha Pombo, Manuel Bomfim, and Jos√© Ver√≠ssimo as teachers. The diffusion of socialist ideas increased during the First World War, but most of the Brazilian left-wing groups were still alienated from the general public. In June 1916, Francisco Vieira da Silva, Toledo de Loiola, Alonso Costa, and Mariano Garcia launched the Manifesto of the Brazilian Socialist Party (Manifesto do Partido Socialista Brasileiro). On May 1st of the following year, the Manifesto of the Socialist Party of Brazil (Manifesto do Partido Socialista do Brasil) was launched, signed by Nestor Peixoto de Oliveira, Isaac Izeckson, and Murilo Ara√∫jo. This group launched Evaristo de Morais to the House of Representatives and published two newspapers, Folha Nova (The New Leaf) and Tempos Novos (New Times), both short-lived. In December 1919, the Socialist League (Liga Socialista) was formed in Rio de Janeiro. Its members started publishing the magazine Clart√© in 1921, with the support of Evaristo de Morais, Maur√≠cio de Lacerda, Nicanor do Nascimento, Agripino Nazar√©, Le√¥nidas de Resende, Pontes de Miranda, among others. The group would extend its influence to S√£o Paulo, with Nereu Rangel Pestana, and to Recife, with Joaquim Pimenta. In 1925 a new Brazilian Socialist Party (Partido Socialista do Brasil) was launched, also formed by the group led by Evaristo de Morais. The foundation of the Brazilian Communist Party (Partido Comunista Brasileiro ‚Äì PCB) in 1922 and its rapid growth suffocated the dozens of anarchist organizations which had played an important role in staging major strikes during the previous decade. PCB staged major strikes throughout the 1920s. Also during that period before the 1930 Revolution and Get√∫lio Vargas' rise to power, Maur√≠cio de Lacerda launched the short-lived United Front of the Left (Frente Unida das Esquerdas), whose purpose was to write a draft socialist constitution for Brazil. The political agitation of the period included a movement in the tenente revolts context led by future Communist leader Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes. Also, as a part of the Tenente revolts, a short-lived commune was formed in Manaus. Prestes was invited by Vargas to lead the military efforts of his uprising against the S√£o Paulo oligarchy, but he refused; he was against an alliance between tenentes and dissident oligarchs. He exiled himself in the Soviet Union and was admitted as a member of PCB. In Moscow, he accepted the task, proposed by the Comintern, of leading a Communist upheaval in Brazil. Vargas Era (1930‚Äì1945) German-Brazilian militant Olga Ben√°rio Prestes (1908‚Äì1942). Political activity was highly repressed during the Vargas regime. On November 23‚Äì27, 1935, Prestes' upheaval (Intentona Comunista) took place in Natal, Recife, and Rio de Janeiro almost simultaneously. It was led by the National Liberation Alliance (Alian√ßa Nacional Libertadora ‚Äì ANL), an organization which gathered anti-fascist (socialist, communist, liberals, progressive and nationalist) military officers. In Natal, the rebels even formed a military junta which ruled the city for four days. According to the official Vargas government account, the rebels killed 32 military officers in Rio de Janeiro, but the event is still questioned. The repression of the uprising resulted not only in the arrest of communist militants involved in it but also the persecution of popular forces in general. In 1936, Prestes and his wife, Olga Ben√°rio Prestes, then pregnant, were arrested as a result of their participation in the upheaval. Ben√°rio, a Jewish German-Brazilian Communist militant, was deported by the Vargas regime to Nazi Germany. Ben√°rio was eventually killed at the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in 1942; she had given birth at the facility a few years earlier and her daughter, Anita Leoc√°dia Prestes, was handed to Brazilian authorities by the Nazis at age one. With her father still in jail upon her arrival in Brazil, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Leoc√°dia Prestes. Another victim of the Vargas regime was the Italian-Brazilian anarchist Oreste Ristori, deported to the Kingdom of Italy in 1936 and killed by Fascist police officers on December 2, 1943. In 1937, Vargas imposed a Fourth Constitution for the country, the so-called Polaca, after his government denounced that international military forces were trying to make a \\"socialist revolution\\" in Brazil, in what became known as Plano Cohen. This false claim was a pretext for Vargas to perpetuate himself in power. Written by Justice Minister Francisco Campos, the Polaca was inspired by the authoritarian April Constitution of Poland, and was intended to consolidate the executive branch over the legislative and judiciary, implementing what became known as the Estado Novo regime. Polaca banned all political parties, implemented censorship in the press, and suppressed even further the organized movements of workers and of the society in general. Second Republic (1945‚Äì1964) Jo√£o Goulart, President of Brazil from 1961 to 1964. After the end of the Vargas regime in 1945, socialist ideas started developing again in the Post-War period with the creation of the Democratic Left (Esquerda Democr√°tica) party, which was eventually registered as the Brazilian Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Brasileiro ‚Äì PSB) on the Electoral Justice Court in August 1947. The PCB was also re-legalized, but the fear of Communism also increased among the middle and upper classes in the context of the Cold War. In 1946, Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes became the first self- proclaimed Communist Senator of Brazil, a feat which would only be repeated sixty years later, when In√°cio Arruda was elected to represent Cear√°. By 1947, the PCB had nearly 200,000 members, having received 480,000 votes (nearly 9% of the total) in that year's legislative election. The party, however, was denounced as being \\"internationalist, and therefore not committed to Brazil's own interests\\" by Eurico Gaspar Dutra in 1948, having its license revoked by the Electoral Justice Court. In 1956, clashes emerged in the party after Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin's policies at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The factionalization of the PCB accelerated after a new Manifesto was approved in 1958, proposing new ways of achieving communist goals, linking the establishment of socialism to the broadening of democracy. Some of its top leaders, dissatisfied with this guidelines, quit PCB and formed a new party, Communist Party of Brazil (Partido Comunista do Brasil ‚Äì PCdoB), in 1962. As a result, both parties claim to have been established in 1922. In 1955, the Latin American Episcopal Conference (Conselho Episcopal Latino Americano ‚Äì CELAM) was created in Rio de Janeiro. It pushed the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) toward a more socially oriented stance. CELAM is the main basis for the foundation of the Liberation theology, which would play a significant role on the Brazilian left in the following decades, before declining in the late 1990s. In 1961, after the resignation of J√¢nio Quadros, Vice-President Jo√£o Goulart, a social-democrat with popular reform proposals, took office. He would, however, rule the country de facto only in 1963, after a referendum ended the parliamentary system approved by the Congress to prevent the Military Forces from overthrowing him from office due to his progressive views. During Goulart's government, PSB's president Jo√£o Mangabeira became Justice Minister. A military coup in 1964 deposed Goulart under charges that he was leading a socialist revolution with his Basic Reforms (Reformas de Base) program. Goulart's biggest political opponent ‚Äì and coup supporter ‚Äì was Carlos Lacerda, son of Maur√≠cio de Lacerda, founder of PCB who later joined the National Democratic Union (Uni√£o Democr√°tica Nacional ‚Äì UDN), an anti- Communist party. Military dictatorship (1964‚Äì1985) Workers' Party logo. With the 1964 coup, all political parties were banned, and socialist organizations had to act clandestinely once again. The creation of bipartisanship in 1965 by a presidential decree allowed moderate left-wing politicians to join the Brazilian Democratic Movement (Movimento Democr√°tico Brasileiro ‚Äì MDB), the party of consented opposition to the military regime. In the second half of the 1960s and all through the 1970s, socialists and other opposition groups to the military dictatorship suffered relentless persecution. The vast majority of militants in armed organizations that fought the regime professed socialist ideas, ranging from Leninism to Maoism. As during the Vargas dictatorship, the guerrilla warfare carried out by Communist groups was used by the regime's propaganda as a justification for repression. The slow redemocratization process initiated by Ernesto Geisel in the second half of the 1970s yielded its first gains on the following decade, when socialist and communist parties were once again able to organize freely and stand their own candidates. In January 1979, at the XI Steelworkers Congress, the proposal to launch the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores ‚Äì PT), a democratic socialist party, was made. Its official foundation would occur a year later at the Catholic school Col√©gio Sion (Sion High School) in S√£o Paulo. PT is a result of the approach between trade unionists of the Central √önica dos Trabalhadores (CUT), intellectuals, artists, Catholics influenced by liberation theology, and the old Brazilian left. The party, however, can be described as a New Left party, once it refused \\"taking the path of the old Latin American left, in the form of the guerrilla movement or Stalinism\\". In 1984, the Landless Workers' Movement was created as a reaction to the military regime's failed land reform program. This socialist group grew rapidly, becoming the largest social movement organization in Latin America, with an estimated 1.5 million members organized in 23 out of Brazil's 26 states. PT and MST have been closely linked to each other since the mid-1980s, but have grown apart in recent years. New Republic (1985‚Äìpresent) In 1988, rubber tapper, unionist and environmental activist Chico Mendes, a member of the PT and an icon of the struggle for preservation of the Amazon Rainforest was assassinated in his house in Xapuri, Acre. He is recognized today as one of the first leaders of the Brazilian eco-socialism movement. In the 1989 election, the PT formed a socialist coalition with the PSB and PC do B and had Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva as its presidential candidate. Although feared by the elite for proposing land reform, Lula declared that neither him or his party have ever been Marxist in a televised debate. The democratic socialist Democratic Labour Party (Partido Democr√°tico Trabalhista ‚Äì PDT), the only Brazilian member of the Socialist International, which claimed to be the actual heir of Goulart's and Vargas' Brazilian Labour Party (Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro ‚Äì PTB), launched Leonel Brizola as their presidential candidate. Lula narrowly beat Brizola in the first-round and went on to the second round of the election, losing to neoliberal candidate Fernando Collor de Mello. After two unsuccessful attempts (losing both to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a Social-Democrat, who soon adhered to the Third Way neoliberal agenda), Lula was eventually elected in 2002. In spite of criticism of his government for alliances with right-wing politicians and practicing some unorthodox neoliberal politics,Larrabure, Manuel. \\"'N√£o nos representam!'

Retrieved on 2017-07-19. A major departure from his government and his party was from the group which created the Socialism and Liberty Party (Partido Socialismo e Liberdade ‚Äì PSOL). In 2010, PT's Dilma Rousseff was elected the first female President of Brazil. During her term, there were widespread protests for better living standards, in which PT was criticized for distancing itself from social movements and youth organizations; for many it seems the PT's reformist model of left-wing politics is reaching its limits.

The U.S. Air Force officially credits him with four aerial victories during the war,Air Force Historical Research Agency although other sources claim he had five, and thus was a flying ace. He was one of the founding officers of what would become the Maryland Air National Guard. As a member of the Maryland National Guard, he was mobilized during World War II. He rose to the rank of colonel during the war. He died on December 12, 1945 in an aircraft accident. Tipton Airport (formerly Tipton Army Airfield) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, is named in his honor. World War I Tipton joined the U.S. Army Air Service on June 5, 1917, as a flying cadet. He was commissioned on March 9, 1918, and was one of the American pilots forwarded to the Royal Flying Corps for advanced training and combat seasoning. According to some sources, he won his first two air battles in May 1918, while attached to the British No. 3 Squadron. Rejoining the American 17th Aero Squadron on 21 June, he became a balloon buster on 22 August 1918. Four days later, he destroyed two Fokker D.VII in a late afternoon dogfight, but was also wounded and shot down, most probably by Leutnant Hermann Frommherz. Tipton spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Germans. He was awarded the British Distinguished Flying Cross during the war The U.S. Air Force aerial victory credit register does not include the two alleged victories from May. Instead, it includes a single aerial victory on 7 June 1918. The register does corroborate Tipton's last three victories. Tipton flew his first combat missions in May 1918, so it is possible that he did indeed score the two victories the U.S. Air Force does not credit to him. It is also possible (speculation) that these victories were attributed to the wrong \\"William D. Tipton,\\" especially given that the sources that credit him with these victories frequently misidentify him as \\"William Duncan Tipton.\\" Interwar Years Tipton was one of the founding members of the 104th Observation Squadron, the original unit of the Maryland Air National Guard (MDANG). At the time the unit was organized in 1921, Tipton was a captain and held the position of flight leader. From 1924 to 1929, he served as the squadron commander.Ball, Ronald. The Maryland Air National Guard: A Commemorative History, 1921-2000, p. 269 He later rose to the position of Division Air Officer for the 29th Infantry Division, of which the 104th was a part. During the interwar period, Tipton played an influential role in the development of aviation in Maryland. He worked as the \\"staff aviator\\" for the Baltimore Sun newspaper, where he not only wrote a column devoted to aviation, but used an aircraft to gather news. This is believed to be the first time a newspaper employed an aircraft for newsgathering purposes. In addition, he served on the state aviation commission from 1921 to 1928, and leased and ran the Curtiss- Wright aviation facility northwest of Baltimore in the 1930s and 40s. World War II By the time Maryland National Guard was mobilized for World War II, Tipton had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel. During the war, he was promoted to the rank of full colonel and served in a number of assignments. He was a senior member of the 72nd Fighter Wing until taking command of Peterson Field, Colorado, on June 10, 1944. In March 1945, he was transferred to Dalhart Army Airfield, Texas. His final assignment was command of the 204th Army Air Force Base Unit at Briggs Field, Texas. He was killed on December 12, 1945, when the P-47N he was piloting crashed near Adena, Ohio, as he was flying home to be released from active duty.Ball, Ronald.

It also formed part of the more ancient kingdoms of D√°l Riata and D√°l nAraidi, as well as part of the Earldom of Ulster. It was once ruled by the MacQuillans and later the MacDonnells. Name The Route derives its name from the MacQuillans, who had bought the remaining lands and manors of the de Mandevilles in north Antrim in the 1460s. Originally known as Twescard, they renamed it the Route, after their \\"rout\\", a common term then for a private army. History The territory of Route was originally part of Twescard, which was a county of the Earldom of Ulster, that at its height stretched from the Glens of Antrim to Inishowen. The murder of the Earl of Ulster in 1333 saw the Irish chiefdoms rebel and the Earldom of Ulster eventually collapsed, with it gradually almost all falling under Gaelic control. By the 1460s, the de Mandevilles who held manors in Twescard, decided to abandon them and sold their land to the MacQuillans, who according to the Annals of Ulster were already in the region warring with the O'Cahans as far back as 1442. The MacQuillans themselves had fled from their territory in Down, having originally come over to Ulster from southwest Scotland to aid the earls of Ulster as mercenaries. Both families had previously held the office of \\"constable of the bonnaght\\" for the Earldom of Ulster - a system adopted from the Irish where mercenaries where hired to act as a body of standing troops. The Lord Deputy of Ireland Sir John Perrot successfully reduced Ulster into allegiance to the English during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He laid siege to Dunluce Castle forcing its surrender on honourable terms. The MacDonnells subsequently took it back by \\"treachery\\" but in 1585 it was once more surrendered to the English by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, to whom it was returned in charge. Having made his submission, Sorley Boy obtained a grant to himself and his heirs of the greater part of the Route territory, between the rivers Bann and Bush (an area then called the Boys), with certain other lands to the east, and was made constable of Dunluce Castle. A month beforehand, Sorley Boy's nephew had received a grant in similar terms of the greater part of the Glynns. At the same time, in the Treaty of Berwick (1586), a clause was inserted recognising the right of the clan MacDonnell to remain in Ireland. In 1584, as part of the shiring of Ulster, Sir John Perrott merged the territory of the Route with that of the Glens of Antrim and the greater portion of the territory of Clandeboye to create County Antrim. He also divided it into baronies, with the Route being divided into the baronies of Dunluce Lower and Upper, the North East Liberties of Coleraine, and Toome Lower and Upper. In 1613 as part of the creation of County Londonderry during the Plantation of Ulster, the northwestern portion of the Route that formed the North East Liberties of Coleraine was transferred from County Antrim so that the London companies could control both banks of the River Bann. McQuillan‚ÄìO'Cahan feud During the mid-15th to mid-16th centuries a strong feud raged between the McQuillans of the Route and their O'Cahan neighbours to their west that would have dire consequences. According to the Annals of Ulster, it started in 1442 when the McQuillans along with the O'Neills invaded the O'Cahan territory. This resulted in several wars of shifting allegiances and various contestants. The O'Neills, Sweeneys, and O'Donnells would ally with the O'Cahans and the MacDonnells of the Glens would aid the McQuillans. In 1542 the McQuillans would appeal to the English for help, and seeing the opportunity to submit the O'Cahans to the surrender and regrant policy of King Henry VIII, the warden of Coleraine, John Travers, was ordered to attack the O'Cahans. The English would capture Limavady Castle and kill all the O'Cahan troops in the area, with Manus O'Cahan submitting partly to the Crown and signing an indenture of peace. The peace only lasted about two years before the O'Cahans and O'Donnells invaded the territory of the McQuillans, again capturing the castle at Ballylough, which was then besieged by the McQuillans and MacDonnells. By 1553, the territory of the O'Cahans was described as \\"for the most part waste\\". In 1559, already weakened by the ravages of war with the O'Cahans and their allies, the McQuillans were unready for the treachery that was to take place. Seeing an opportunity to expand his territory and influence, Sorley Boy MacDonnell, with the aid of levies from Scotland, launched a mass assault on the Route against the McQuillans. The final battle of this assault was at Aura, and saw the end of the McQuillans and the conquest of the Route by the MacDonnells. It is claimed that the McQuillans were betrayed to the MacDonnells by a piper named O'Cahan. The end result of this bitter feud saw the McQuillans destroyed and the O'Cahans weakened in face of an ever-growing English presence.

It has recently been proven to be the only medical intervention which reduces brain damage, and improves an infant's chance of survival and reduced disability. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has many causes and is essentially the reduction in the supply of blood or oxygen to a baby's brain before, during, or even after birth. It is a major cause of death and disability, occurring in approximately 2‚Äì3 per 1000 births and causing around 20% of all cases of cerebral palsy. Medical uses A 2013 Cochrane review found that therapeutic hypothermia is useful in full term babies with encephalopathy. Extended follow-up of trial participants Studies have been undertaken to determine the effects of hypothermia beyond early childhood. Participants in the CoolCap, NICHD and TOBY trials were entered into extended follow-up programmes. None of these programmes have sufficient power to make confident assessments of the long-term effect of hypothermia, however even these underpowered studies give important information on whether the therapeutic effects of cooling are sustained beyond the first two years after birth. The most significant follow-up study published so far is the assessment of the NICHD trial participants at 6‚Äì7 years. Of the 208 trial participants, primary outcome data were available for 190. Of the 97 children in the hypothermia group and the 93 children in the control group, death or an IQ score below 70 occurred in 46 (47%) and 58 (62%), respectively (P=0.06); death occurred in 27 (28%) and 41 (44%) (P=0.04); and death or severe disability occurred in 38 (41%) and 53 (60%) (P=0.03). The CoolCap study gathered data using the WeeFim questionnaire at 7‚Äì8 years of age, but only collected information on 62 (32 cooled; 30 standard care) of 135 surviving children who had had neurodevelopmental assessment at 18 months. Disability status at 18 months was strongly associated with WeeFIM ratings (P < 0.001) suggesting that the therapeutic effect persisted, but there was no significant effect of treatment (P = 0.83). These results were not quite conclusive, as the effect in the NICHD trial appears to be on mortality rather than neurological function, but they gave considerable confidence that the therapeutic effects of hypothermia following birth asphyxia are sustained into later childhood, and the preliminary childhood outcomes of the Toby trial presented at the Hot Topics in Neonatology meeting in Washington DC in December 2013 appear to confirm persisting benefit of treatment on neurological function; these data await peer review and formal publication and if confirmed would provide the definitive data needed for evidence-based health policy decisions.  Current state of the evidence  Hypothermic neural rescue therapy is an evidence- based clinical treatment which increases a severely injured full term infant's chance of surviving without brain damage detectable at 18 months by about 50%, an effect which seems to be sustained into later childhood. At present data relate only to full term infants, and all human studies of hypothermia treatment have so far been restricted to infants >36 weeks out of an expected 40 weeks gestation. There are both more potential side effects on the developing premature with lung disease, and there is more evident protection by hypothermia when a greater volume of complex brain is actively developing. During mid gestation to late term the fetal brain is undergoing increasingly complex progressive growth of first the mid-brain and then development of the cortex and \\"higher\\" centers. The effects of fetal asphyxia on the developing brain in sheep are dependent on gestational age with near term fetuses showing both less tolerance of asphyxia and maximal damage in the rapidly expanding cortex; while fetuses prior to the last third of development experience more extended tolerance of asphyxia with maximal effects on the growing mid-brain. The fetal sheep asphyxia model also suggests a six-hour window post asphyxia in which hypothermia will have greatest benefit. There remains much that is unknown. Recognition of infants with marginal external signs of asphyctic damage at birth, who still develop moderate hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy would be enhanced by finding more reliable bio-markers or physiologic tests accurately predicting the risk for progressive damage. These tests could also prevent unwarranted, expensive treatment of many infants. Long-term follow-up has yet to demonstrate show persisting benefit, but available data together with an imaging study nested in TOBY also found reduced brain tissue damage in cooled infants are encouraging. The simplicity that attracted empiricists to cooling centuries ago now makes hypothermic neural rescue with accurate patient selection a potentially transforming therapy for low-resource environments where birth asphyxia remains a major cause of death and disability. Ironically this brings back the problem of cooling infants in an environment where modern resuscitation and intensive care are not available.  Mechanisms of action  Much of what is known about the mechanisms of hypothermic neuroprotection is gathered from studies in mature and adult models. What follows uses some of these data while trying to focus on the immature brain.  Hypoxia-ischaemia  Cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia results in reduced cerebral oxidative metabolism, cerebral lactic acidosis and cell membrane ionic transport failure; if prolonged there is necrotic cell death. Although rapid recovery of cerebral energy metabolism occurs following successful resuscitation this is followed some hours later by a secondary fall in cerebral high energy phosphates accompanied by a rise in intracellular pH, and the characteristic cerebral biochemical disturbance at this stage is a lactic alkalosis. In neonates, the severity of this secondary impairment in cerebral metabolism are associated with abnormal subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome and reduced head growth. Several adverse biological events contribute to this secondary deterioration, including: release of excitatory amino acids which activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors on neurons (30,37) and oligodendroglial precursors, accumulation of excitatory neurotransmitters, generation of reactive oxygen radicals, intracellular calcium accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Whilst necrotic cell death is prominent in the immediate and acute phases of severe cerebral insults, the predominant mode of death during the delayed phase of injury appears to be apoptosis. Neuroprotective mechanisms need to interact with these mechanisms to have beneficial effect. Newborn hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury differs from injury in the adult brain in several ways: NMDA receptor toxicity is much higher in the immature brain. Apoptotic mechanisms including activation of caspases, translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome-c release are much greater in the immature than the adult. The inflammatory activation is different with less contribution from polymorphonuclear cells and a more prominent role of IL-18 whereas IL-1, which is critical in the adult brain, is less important. The anti-oxidant system is underdeveloped with reduced capacity to inactivate hydrogen peroxide.  Actions of hypothermia  Mild hypothermia helps prevent disruptions to cerebral metabolism both during and following cerebral insults. Hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and oxygen and reduces the loss of high energy phosphates during hypoxia-ischaemia and during secondary cerebral energy failure, and reduces delayed cerebral lactic alkalosis. The simultaneous increase in cytotoxic oedema and loss of cerebral cortical activity that accompanies secondary energy failure is also prevented. Hypothermia appears to have multiple effects at a cellular level following cerebral injury. Hypothermia reduces vasogenic oedema, haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration after trauma. The release of excitatory neurotransmitters is reduced, limiting intracellular calcium accumulation. Free radical production is lessened, which protects cells and cellular organelles from oxidative damage during reperfusion. In addition mild hypothermia may reduce the activation of the cytokine and coagulation cascades through increased activation of suppressor signalling pathways, and by inhibiting release of platelet activating factor. Many of the effects induced by mild hypothermia may help to reduce the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that the number of apoptotic neurons is reduced caspase activity is lessened and cytochrome c translocation is diminished by mild hypothermia, and there may be an increase in expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCl-2.  History  Many physicians over the centuries have tried to resuscitate babies after birth by altering their body temperatures, essentially aiming to animate the infant by inducing the onset of breathing. Little thought was given to brain protection, because cerebral hypoxia during birth was not linked with later neurological problems until William John Little in 1861, and even then this was controversial; Sigmund Freud, for example, famously disagreed, and when scientific studies of neonatal therapeutic hypothermia were begun in the 1950s researchers like Bjorn Westin still reported their work in terms of re- animation rather than neuroprotection. Investigators such as James Miller and Clement Smith carried out clinical observations and careful physiological experiments, but although some babies were conscientiously followed up, they were not mainly concerned with long term neurological outcome. However, by the 1960s physicians saw hypothermia after delivery as something to be avoided. The problem of infants who failed to breathe at birth had been solved by the invention of mechanical ventilation, so any benefit cooling might have for re- animation was no longer needed, and an influential trial showed that keeping small and preterm infants warm increased survival. These results, together with observational and experimental data made it an article of medical faith for decades that babies should not be allowed to get cold. Consequently, during the next two decades studies of neonatal hypothermia in Europe and the USA were sporadic and often unsuccessful. An interest in cooling for brain protection was beginning to emerge, but contemporary neuroscience provided few useful concepts to guide this research and little progress was made. Although across the Iron Curtain in the Soviet Union cooling was being applied empirically following birth asphyxia, the language barrier, cold war politics and the Russians' failure to carry out randomised controlled trials contributed to an almost total ignorance of this work in the West. Indeed, a group of Russian neonatologists who described hypothermic neural rescue during a visit to the Neonatal Unit in Bristol, UK, met with little interest.Prof Peter Dunn, Bristol, personal communication  Neural rescue  In the late 1980s the development of a new set of concepts and problems led to a re- examination. A new generation of neonatal researchers were influenced by the growing evidence that protecting the brain against the effects of oxygen deprivation during labour might be possible. These researchers were aware that cooling produced powerful intra-ischaemic neuroprotection during cardiac surgery but a new concept of hypothermic post-insult neural rescue developed. This shift in thinking was possible because of at least three major new ideas that were developing at the same time: delayed post-ischaemic cell death; excitotoxicity; and apoptosis.  Delayed cell death  The first paradigm shift that affected neonatal researchers in particular was the idea that if a baby was resuscitated after cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia there was a period of time before brain cells started to die. Osmund Reynolds at University College London used the newly developed technique of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to show that the infant brain metabolism is normal in the hours after birth asphyxia and deteriorated only after a distinct delay. Robert Vannucci confirmed the effect with painstaking biochemistry, and delayed injury was also reported in neuropathological studies. Delayed brain injury (called 'secondary energy failure' by Reynolds) was a critical new idea. If brain cells remained normal for a time and the mechanism of the delayed death could be unravelled, it opened the possibility of therapeutic intervention in what had previously seemed an impossible situation.  Excitotoxicity  The new and transforming concept of excitotoxicity developed from the seminal experiments of John Olney and Brian Meldrum. They showed that at least some of the neural cell death caused by hypoxia-ischaemia is mediated by excess production of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and that pharmacological blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor could provide good protection against hypoxic damage. Olney and Meldrum had shifted the paradigm, allowing researchers to think of hypoxic-ischaemic damage as a treatable disease.  Apoptosis  However, it was still a mystery how and why cells triggered by hypoxia-ischaemia should die hours or days later, particularly when it became clear that glutamate levels were not particularly high during secondary energy failure. The next critical idea came with the discovery of programmed cell death, a novel form of cell suicide. Originally observed as a pathological appearance and named apoptosis (\\"falling off\\", as of leaves) in the 1970s, Horvitz, Raff and Evan provided a molecular understanding and showed that apoptosis could be triggered by cellular insults. The radical idea that hypoxia-ischaemia triggered a cell suicide programme which could explain the perplexing phenomenon of delayed cell death was soon supported by experimental and human data, and many researchers believe this helps explain why neural rescue works in the newborn. However the picture is complex: both apoptosis and necrosis are present in variable proportions; and there seems to be prolonged neurodegeneration after an insult. Research into this problem continues.  Neonatal neural rescue  These ideas flowed through the perinatal research community, producing a new belief that neural rescue after birth asphyxia should be possible. Amongst the first to have attempt neonatal neural rescue in animals were Ingmar Kjellmer and Henrik Hagberg in Gothenburg, and Michael Johnston in Baltimore. The potential began to draw in other neonatal researchers from diverse fields to begin neuroprotection research, including those who came to form the informal neonatal hypothermia research group: Peter Gluckman and Tania Gunn were endocrinologists in the University of Auckland New Zealand and interested in cooling for its effect on thyroid function; they had first cooled a sheep fetus for endocrine studies in 1983. Denis Azzopardi, John Wyatt and David Edwards, then young researchers working for Reynolds, were using Reynolds's sophisticated MRS approach to replicate secondary energy failure in newborn piglets and immature rats; in Gluckman's laboratory Alistair Gunn and Chris Williams developed a simple and elegant biophysical method using cerebral impedance to do essentially the same thing in fetal sheep. Marianne Thoresen, who was working on cerebral perfusion, was prompted to think about neuroprotection by stories of children who fell through the Norwegian ice and suffering prolonged drowning in iced water but emerged with preserved cerebral function. There were many potential therapies around which might achieve neural rescue, and most of these workers did not immediately move to hypothermia. Magnesium was an appealingly simple excitoxin receptor antagonist that protected cells in culture: the Reynolds group tested it in their piglet model without success. Gluckman and Gunn started by looking unsuccessfully at flunarizine, a calcium entry inhibitor. Edwards picked on nitric oxide synthase inhibition which was also a failure. Gluckman had success with his innovative studies of IGF-1, but could not immediately translate this to clinical practice.

Early life and education  Madhava Rao came of an ancient family of Thanjavur Marathi Deshastha Brahmin family, long ago settled in Tanjore, who was supposed to have emigrated from the Satara district to south India in the wake of Maratha conquest of Tanjore. The Indian Review, Volume 18 By G.A. Natesan,Page 863 Indian Statesmen, Dewans and Prime Ministers of Native States By G.A. Natesan , Page 113 Madhava Rao was born in February 1850 in Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency. He was educated at Kumbakonam College by William Archer Porter. He completed his B. A. in 1869 and was appointed as a headmaster in royal school in the Mysore kingdom.  Appointments  Madhava Rao entered the service of the Mysore kingdom in 1869 as a headmaster of the royal school. He was later appointed public prosecutor of Mysore and served in the Judicial and Revenue departments. He also served as Inspector General of Police, Plague Commissioner in the Mysore kingdom from 1898 to 1901 and Revenue Commissioner from 1902 to 1904 before being appointed Diwan in 1906.  Diwan of Mysore  Madhava Rao served as Diwan of the Mysore kingdom from 30 June 1906 to 31 March 1909. In 1906, a law was passed empowering members of the Mysore Legislative Assembly to pass laws. The new legislature was constituted on 6 March 1907. The Land Revenue Code was amended to make the Revenue Commissioner the Chief Revenue authority and was also given charge of the treasury. A Department of Public Health was created and competitive exams for the Mysore Civil Service were revived. Taxes on arecanut were revoked. Kindergarten schools were introduced in the kingdom and primary education was made free. A number of irrigation projects were undertaken. The Marikanite Works were completed in 1906-07 and the Cauvery Power Works at Belagola in 1907-08. The Government sanctioned a free grant of land to the Indian Institute of Science. Electric lighting was introduced in the civil and military station of Bangalore city on 1 January 1908 and for Mysore city on 26 September 1908.  Honours  Madhava Rao was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1899 and was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal in 1900.

Aircraft are constructed in such a way that make it very difficult to see beyond what is directly in front of them. As safety is a primary focus in aviation, communication methods such as wireless radio are an effective way for aircraft to communicate with the necessary personnel. Aviation is an international industry and as a result involves multiple languages. However, as deemed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), English is the official language of aviation. The industry considers that some pilots may not be fluent English speakers and as a result pilots are obligated to participate in an English proficiency test. Background Aviation communication is the means by which aircraft crews connect with other aircraft and people on the ground to relay information. Aviation communication is a crucial component pertaining to the successful functionality of aircraft movement both on the ground and in the air. Increased communication reduces the risk of an accident. During the early stages of aviation, it was assumed that skies were too big and empty that it was impossible that two planes would collide. However, in 1956 two planes famously crashed over the Grand Canyon, which sparked the creation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Aviation was roaring during the Jet Age and as a result, communication technologies needed to be developed. This was initially seen as a very difficult task: ground controls used visual aids to provide signals to pilots in the air. With the advent of portable radios small enough to be placed in planes, pilots were able to communicate with people on the ground. With later developments, pilots were then able to converse air-to-ground and air-to-air. Today, aviation communication relies heavily on the use of many systems. Planes are outfitted with the newest radio and GPS systems, as well as Internet and video capabilities. English is the main language used by the aviation industry; the use of aviation English is regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Early systems Flight was considered a foreign concept until the Wright Brothers successfully completed the world's first human flight in 1903. The industry grew rapidly and ground crews initially relied on coloured paddles, signal flares, hand signs, and other visual aids to communicate with incoming and outgoing aircraft. Although these methods were effective for ground crews, they offered no way for pilots to communicate back. As wireless telegraphy technologies developed alongside the growth of aviation during the first decade of the twentieth century, wireless telegraph systems were used to send messages in Morse code, first from ground-to-air and later air-to-ground. With this technology, planes were able to call in accurate artillery fire and act as forward observers in warfare. In 1911, wireless telegraphy was put into operational use in the Italo-Turkish War. In 1912, the Royal Flying Corps had begun experimenting with \\"wireless telegraphy\\" in aircraft. Lieutenant B.T James was a leading pioneer of wireless radio in aircraft. In the spring of 1913, James had begun to experiment with radios in a B.E.2A. James managed to successfully increase the efficiency of wireless radio before he was shot down and killed by anti- aircraft fire on July 13, 1915. Nonetheless, wireless communication systems in aircraft remained experimental and would take years to successfully develop a practical prototype. The early radios were heavy in weight and were unreliable; additionally, ground forces rarely used radio because signals were easily intercepted and targeted by opposing forces. At the beginning of World War I, aircraft were not typically equipped with wireless equipment. Instead, soldiers used large panel cut outs to distinguish friendly forces. These cut outs could also be used as a directional device to help pilots navigate back to friendly and familiar airfields. In April 1915, Captain J.M. Furnival was the first person to hear a voice from the ground from Major Prince who said, \\"If you can hear me now, it will be the first time speech has ever been communicated to an aeroplane in flight.\\" In June 1915, the world's first air- to-ground voice transmission took place at Brooklands, England over about 20 miles. Ground-to-air was initially by Morse code, but it is believed 2-way voice communications were available and installed by July 1915. By early 1916, the Marconi Company (England) started production of air-to-ground radio transmitters/receivers which were used in the war over France. In 1917, AT&T; invented the first American air-to-ground radio transmitter. They tested this device at Langley Field in Virginia and found it was a viable technology. In May 1917, General George Squier of the U.S. Army Signal Corps contacted AT&T; to develop an air-to-ground radio with a range of 2,000 yards. By July 4 of that same year, AT&T; technicians achieved two-way communication between pilots and ground personnel. This allowed ground personnel to communicate directly with pilots using their voices instead of Morse code. Though few of these devices saw service in the war, they proved this was a viable and valuable technology worthy of refinement and advancement. Interwar Following World War I new technology was developed to increase the range and performance of the radios being used to communicate with planes in the air. In December 1919 a year after the end of World War I, Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard, a senior officer in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) later Royal Air Force (RAF), produced a report on the permanent organisation and operations of the RAF in peacetime in which he argued that if the air force officer was not to be a chauffeur, and nothing more, then navigation, meteorology, photography and wireless were necessities. It was not until 1930 that airborne radios were reliable enough and had enough power to make them effective; and it was this year that the International Commission for Aerial Navigation agreed that all aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers should carry wireless equipment. Prior to this, only military aircraft designated for scout missions required radios. The operating distance of radios increased much slower than the distance planes were able to travel. After an original two mile range for the two-way radio systems tested by 1917 had extended to ranges of an average of 20 miles, which remained a practical limit for medium sized aircraft. In terms of air traffic control, this resulted in a plane's messages having to bounce from airfield to airfield in order to get to its intended recipient. As the speed of planes increased, this resulted in a plane reaching its destination before the message announcing its departure. On 15 November 1938, the Army Airways Communications System (AACS) was established. This was a point-to-point communications system used by the US Army Air Corps, that allowed army air fields to remain in contact with planes throughout their entire flight. It could also be used to disseminate weather reports and orders to military aircraft and act as an air traffic control for arrivals and departures at military airfields. As technology increased, systems such as the AACS expanded and spread across the globe as other militaries and civilian services developed their own systems of air control. The R1155/T1154 combination used by the RAF in WWII World War II The development of radar in the mid-1930s proved a great advance in air-to-ground communication. Radar could be used to track planes in the air and determine distance, direction, speed and even type of aircraft. This allowed for better air traffic control as well as navigation aides for pilots. Radar also proved to be a valuable tool in targeting for bombers. Radar stations on the coast of Britain could aim two radar beams from separate locations on the coast towards Germany. By aligning the two radar beams to intersect over the desired target, a town or factory for example, an aircraft could then follow one radar signal until it intersected with the other where it would then know to drop bombs. The Royal Air Force used the R1155/T1154 receiver/transmitter combination in most of its larger aircraft, particularly the Avro Lancaster and Short Sunderland. Single seat aircraft such as the Spitfire and Hurricane were equipped mostly with the TR1143 set. Other systems employed were Eureka and the S-Phone, which enabled Special Operations Executive agents working behind enemy lines to communicate with friendly aircraft and coordinate landings and the dropping of agents and supplies. Communication error Communication error can occur between pilots and between pilots and air traffic controllers. Communication error contains: * amount of information * unclear pronunciation * misunderstanding The more information needing transfer, the more chance for error. Unclear pronunciation could happen with non-English speakers. Sometimes lack of self-confidence and motivation affects expression in communication. Misunderstanding happens with both native speakers and non-native speakers through communication, so a standard aviation language is important to improve this situation. Sources of communication error come from: phonology (speech rate, stress, intonation, pauses), syntax (language word patterns, sentence structure), semantics, and pragmatics (language in context). Even though English is the international aviation language, native English speakers still play a role in misunderstanding and situational awareness. Both the ICAO and the Federal Aviation Administration use alternative phrases, which is confusing to both native and non-native English speakers. The biggest problem regarding non- native English speakers' transmissions is speech rate. In order to understand alternative and unfamiliar accents, people's rate of comprehension and response slows down. Accents also affect transmissions because of the different pronunciations across languages. Some of the earlier miscommunication issues included the limitation of language-based warning systems in aircraft and insufficient English proficiency. According to US department of transportation's report, errors between pilots and controllers include: * Read-back/hear-back errors - the pilot reads back the clearance incorrectly and the controller fails to correct the error - accounted for 47% of the errors found in this analysis. * No pilot read-back. A lack of a pilot read-back contributed to 25% of the errors found in this analysis. * Hear-back Errors Type H - the controller fails to notice his or her own error in the pilot's correct read-back or fails to correct critical erroneous information in a pilot's statement of intent - accounted for 18% of the errors found in this analysis. Generally, miscommunication is caused by mis-hearing by the pilots for 28%, pilot not responding for 20%, controller mis-hearing for 15% and 10% that controllers do not respond. Also, a professional research shows that 30% of the information will be lost during the miscommunication. Moreover, miscommunication exists in personnel with different background of linguistics is shown to be one of the major problem in miscommunication to cause aviation accidents. Avoiding or minimizing miscommunication could be achieved by standardized debriefing or an interview process, and following a checklist to supplement written data. Aviation English The International Civil Aviation Organization established English as the international aviation language in 1951 to improve consistency, accuracy, and effectiveness of pilot - air traffic control communication. It requires that all pilots on international flights and air traffic controllers serving international airports and routes must be able to communicate in English effectively, as well as in their native language. The goal was to achieve standards that would eliminate communication error, language, and comprehension difficulties, all of which have been a major cause of operational airspace incidents. Miscommunication between pilots and air traffic control is a prominent factor in fatal airplane crashes, airspace incidents, runway incursion, and mid-air collisions. Aviation English is the highly specialized language and sequences used by pilots, air traffic control, and other aviation personnel and it focuses on a particular pronunciation, vocabulary, grammatical structure, and discourse styles that are used in specific aviation-related contexts. The language used by pilots and air traffic controllers during radiotelephony communication can be categorized into two types: standard phraseology, and plain language repertoire. Standard phraseology is the specialized phrasing commonly used by the aviation community to effectively communicate, and plain language is a more normal language used in everyday life. Many non-native English speaking pilots and air traffic controllers learn English during their flight training and use it in a highly practical level while safely operating an aircraft and maintaining the safety of airspace, which can be highly stressful. ICAO language proficiency requirements ICAO also established the Language Proficiency Requirements to try to rectify multiple issues regarding accents, terminology, and interpretation in communication. The intention of the LPRs is to \\"ensure that the language proficiency of pilots and air traffic controllers is sufficient to reduce miscommunication as much as possible and to allow pilots and controllers to recognize and solve potential miscommunication when it does occur\\" and \\"that all speakers have sufficient language proficiency to handle non-routine situations.\\" The structure of the LPR has six levels, pronunciation, structure, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and interactions. The implemented universal aviation English proficiency scale ranged from Level 1 to Level 6. Beginning in March 2008, ICAO set out the requirement that all pilots flying international routes and air traffic control serving international airports and routes must be a Level 4 or above and will be continually reassessed every three years. The criteria to achieve Level 4 are as follows: * Pronunciation: A dialect and/or accent intelligible to aeronautical community. * Structure: Relevant grammatical structures and sentence patterns determined by language functions appropriate to the task. * Vocabulary: Vocabulary range and accuracy used sufficiently to communicate effectively. * Fluency: Produces stretches of language at an appropriate tempo. * Comprehension: Comprehension accurate in common, concrete, and work-related topics and the accent used is sufficiently intelligible for the international community. * Interactions: Responses are immediate, appropriate, and informative. Non-English speakers English is the aviation language used by ICAO. Usually, human factors that affect communications include two aspects: direct, meaning the error caused by the language itself, which is the problem for non English speakers, and also indirect, with the gender, age, and experience impacting the communication in aviation. * Accent and dialect are significant problems in aviation communication. These may cause misunderstandings and result in the wrong information being conveyed. * Command of speech structures like grammar and vocabulary can also cause problems. * During the communication through English for non-English speakers, gender and race may affect ability to communicate with the second language which is an indirect impact on communication. * Intonation due to signal limitations, lack of function words, standard phraseology and rapid speech rate also plague many non English speakers. As a result, both pilots and ATCs need to have enough English ability to accomplish their tasks. Through education to help improve aviation English, participants need not only focus on the textbook, but need experience in an actual environment such as lab experience to help speakers to improve their English fluency and avoid misunderstanding which helps non-English speakers to communicate normally.

(later SMORO, IMORO, IMRO). Matov was born in 1872 in Struga, Ottoman Empire (today part of the Republic of North Macedonia). Upon receiving his education in the Bulgarian school in Salonica, he chose a career as a teacher. In 1895, while in Salonica, Matov was initiated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) by Damyan Gruev. His education warranted his subsequent appointment as a director of the Bulgarian pedagogical school of Skopje. In less than a year as head of the school, he succeeded in organizing many revolutionary committees. In 1898 he was elected as member of the Central Committee in Salonica. In 1901, when the Salonica outrage occurred and the Ottoman authorities arrested many IMRO activists, he was imprisoned there and later exiled to Bodrum, Asia Minor. In 1902, as a result of a general amnesty, he was released and allowed to return to Thessaloniki. Soon after, he went to Sofia as a representative of the Central Committee of the IMRO. The failure of the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 reignited the rivalries between the varying factions of the Macedonian revolutionary movement. The left-wing faction opposed Bulgarian nationalism but the Centralist's faction of the IMARO, drifted more and more towards it. At that time Matov became one of the leaders of the Centralist faction. He escaped assassination in 1907, when Boris Sarafov and Ivan Garvanov were killed by the leftist Todor Panitsa. Afterwards, he participated in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War as a Bulgarian officer. Matov was acknowledged as a constitutionalist of the Macedonian movement. He is the author of several books, a number of pamphlets, and several poems while in prison.

Some sources give the date as 1511. It was the culmination of a violent blood feud between the Murray and Drummond families. Although feuding, murdering kin, and marrying enemies was commonplace for Highlanders at the time, the massacre was nevertheless notorious and sensational in its day. Background William Murray of Tullibardine lost the stewardship of Strathearn, which he had held for over fifty years, to Lord Drummond. Despite their marital links, the Drummonds evicted the Murrays and set about creating difficulties for George Murray, the abbot of Inchaffray Abbey. When the abbey subsequently ran short of funds Murray sought to assess the teinds of the Drummond lands of Monzievaird. The abbot charged the Murrays of Ochtertyre with the task, which they eagerly undertook with such brutality that the Drummonds were provoked into violent retaliation. Massacre Lord Drummond‚Äôs second son, David, accompanied by a body of retainers, set out to forcibly evict the Murrays from Ochtertyre, but the Murrays were warned of Drummond's attack and were well prepared. The turning point in the ensuing battle came when a party of McRobbies from Balloch and Faichneys from Argyllshire joined forces with the Drummonds against the Murrays. The Murrays were forced to the north and made a final stand at Hill at Knock Mary on the other side of Rottenreoch, from Monzievard kirk. Many Murrays were killed and the remainder fled back towards Ochtertyre. As the Drummonds made their way back in triumph to Drummond Castle they came upon Duncan Campbell of Dunstaffnage with a party of his clan members. He also had a score to settle with the Murrays, as his father-in-law and two of his sons had been murdered by them some time before. Campbell persuaded the Drummonds to resume their pursuit of the Murrays, and the combined Drummonds and Campbells marched towards Ochtertyre. About 20 Murray men fled and took refuge in the nearby church at Monzievaird, close by Hosh. One shot an arrow from the window of the church, killing one of the Drummonds searching for them outside but revealing their hiding place. The Drummonds retaliated by gathering all the brushwood they could find and stacking it against the church, which was roofed with thatch and heather, and lighting it. Only one of the Murray men survived the fire; the rest were killed either inside the church or trying to escape the building, reportedly to the accompaniment of a piper. The one surviving Murray escaped death by jumping from a window. Thomas Drummond recognized him as his cousin and taking pity on him spirited him away. This act of compassion did not endear Thomas to the rest of his clan; he was forced to leave Crieff and lived in exile in Ireland for many years. Thomas eventually returned to Scotland after the Murrays had regained their power and showed their gratitude by giving him a small estate in Perthshire. This estate originally known as Drummond-Ernoch or Drummond of Ireland, now called Drummonderinoch, lies about a mile southeast of Comrie. The Faichneys, from Argyll, subsequently obtained land holdings around Strageath, Muthill and Innerpeffray. Over the years oral history has placed the number of dead Murrays as high as 120 men along with wives and children, , but others claim that this number is inflated. Outcome Blood feuds were threatening to create a breakdown of political and social life in parts of Scotland at the time and the authorities felt that an example had to be made. James IV of Scotland ordered the arrest of David Drummond and the other main antagonist, Duncan Campbell of Dunstaffnage. Both men were executed by hanging at Stirling. 1809 The old Monzievaird parish church was demolished, and nothing remains. On the site the Ochtertyre family built their Mausoleum in 1809; When the foundations of the present mausoleum were being dug a quantity of charred wood was found, and very many calcined bones Site of the Church in modern times Located near Hosh, by the side of the drive to Ochtertyre house from the A85, the house is about 1.1km to the west. As of 2015 despite the roof being still intact, it is on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.

The Irish game was the only win for England during a season dominated by the Welsh team. Allport was selected for all three games of the 1894 Home Nations Championship, which started with a win over the previous year's winner, Wales.

They live in nests made of earth that can be up to 1.5 m tall and can contain tens of thousands of individuals. Between five and 10 per cent of the population are soldier termites which can be recognised by their yellow abdomen and two large, curved mandibles. The termites use autothysis as a defense mechanism. Defense A drawing of the head of a soldier termite showing the head (H), antennae (A) and the mandibles (M). Scale bar = 0.3mm When the nest is damaged, the soldier termites defend the nest and workers rapidly repair any damage to the nest walls. The soldiers stand on alert on their legs and scan the area with their antennae. If the nest is attacked by ants, for example Oecophylla smaragdina, the workers immediately escape by retreating into the nest, while the soldiers remain outside to defend the nest. They will first attempt to catch and pierce the attackers with their large mandibles. If this does not deter the attackers, some soldiers secrete a yellow liquid from a large gland that occupies a large proportion of their body. The liquid is forced out of the gland by contractions of the mandibular muscles which compress the walls of the gland. This liquid rapidly hardens on contact with air, producing a sticky substance that traps ants and other termites. The secretion also contains a pheromone which attracts more soldiers to fight the attackers. In some cases, the contractions are so violent that the termites rupture themselves. This form of suicidal altruism is known as autothysis. Nitrogen fixation G. sulphureus is able to fix nitrogen. An experiment in Thailand found that they fix around 250 grams of nitrogen per hectare per year. Although this contribution is only between 7% and 22% of the total nitrogen inputs in the ecosystem it is thought to be relatively important as termites add it to dead wood, thereby accelerating its decomposition. Foraging G. sulphureus forages areas of up to 62m2 and ventures up to 16m away from its nest.

It is a free adaptation, wholly shot on film, of Edmund Gosse's autobiographical book Father and Son (1907). Synopsis Philip Gosse, naturalist and Minister of the Plymouth Brethren, and his young son Edmund are in mourning for the recent death of Mrs Gosse; the household held together by religious piety and strict bible study. Despite the claustrophobic environment, Edmund experiences brief moments of joy when his father allows him to view the exotic flora and fauna he keeps in his aquarium as part of his studies. Edmund, however, is troubled by nightmares of a Christ-like figure on a beach beckoning towards him. Confiding in his father about these terrible dreams, he reveals that his recent prayers have been to ask God for a toy sailing boat he has seen for sale in the window of a village shop. Gosse forces Edmund to pray and manipulates him into saying that God will not grant him his wish on the grounds that it is distracting him from spiritual matters. One day the house receives a guest in the form of Mr Brackley: a naturalist visiting Mr Gosse on behalf of Charles Darwin. Darwin is about to publish his seminal work and, aware of Gosse's reputation in the field of natural science, asks for his support in the face of a potential outcry against the Royal Society. Gosse rejects Darwin's theories on the grounds that they cannot be reconciled with his religious beliefs and politely asks Brackley to leave. Despite his conviction that the story of Genesis is literally true, the encounter leads Gosse into questioning his faith; his own studies into marine biology demonstrate that species are not immutable, yet he is troubled at the thought that this challenges the validity of Creation given in the bible. He spends the rest of the evening ruminating on the problem. The next day, Edmund and the Gosse's housekeeper Miss Marks are in the village running an errand when Edmund sees the toy sailboat in the shop window. When Miss Marks' back is turned Edmund is confronted by Mary Teague, the village 'mad woman', who takes him into the woods and sexually assaults him. Edmund manages to get away by hitting her in the face with a stone and rejoins Miss Marks, who is angry that Edmund left her. They hurry back to the house as Gosse is expecting an important visitor that afternoon, Charles Kingsley, with whom he wishes to discuss a book he intends to write reconciling the biblical story with Darwin's findings. Later that evening, as the two men are talking, Edmund has a coughing fit. Kingsley is surprised at Gosse's lack of concern for his son, and is especially taken back when Gosse sends Edmund up to bed with no supper for failing to memorise a bible passage. As Edmund prepares for bed, Gosse tells him that he is sorry that Edmund is feeling unwell and attempts to reassure him by telling him he \\"will soon join [his] mother.\\" Although frightened by his father's words, Edmund attempts to get some sleep. Meanwhile, Gosse and Kingsley resume their discussion. Gosse explains to Kingsley that Darwin is incorrect in assuming that the earth is much older than it appears, and that the species upon it have adapted to suit their environment over time. He uses the example of Adam's navel as a means of reconciling Darwin's studies with scripture. Gosse reasons that if Adam was intended to be the model of humanity he would have a navel despite having no mother; if this is the case then Genesis is merely a \\"cutting in\\" to Creation, and God has specifically designed every life form upon the earth, including man himself, to appear as though a continuing cycle of change and adaptation has taken place. Suddenly a cry is heard from upstairs ‚Äì Edmund is having another bad dream. Gosse goes up to see him and Edmund admits that he has been thinking about the toy sailboat again. Gosse insists that they both pray to God to settle the matter one last time. He turns to face Edmund and asks what God's judgement is; Edmund tells his father that God says he is to have the sailboat. Gosse, confused and troubled by this revelation, leaves Edmund's bedroom. After he exits, Edmund places a chair against the door and returns to sleep. The play concludes with a voice-over taken from Mr Brackley's earlier meeting with Gosse: Principal cast *Alan Badel as Philip Gosse *Max Harris as Edmund Gosse *Heather Canning as Miss Marks *Gareth Forwood as Mr Brackley *Jean Boht as Mary Teague *Ronald Hines as Charles Kingsley Production As with Potter's 1971 serial about the life of Giacomo Casanova, Where Adam Stood is a loose adaptation of original source material set within a fictional framework. In Potter on Potter, the author told editor Graham Fuller that he used only a few pages of Father and Son as his starting point, and rejected the resultant play's status as a straight adaptation. Instead, Potter saw the play as part of a loose trilogy exploring an individual's choices (or rather, lack of them) in the face of seemingly omniscient forces; Where Adam Stood was to form the last part, preceded by Double Dare and Brimstone and Treacle, respectively (both 1976). The BBC's decision not to broadcast Brimstone effectively ended this idea, although Potter would continue to refer to the three as a connected trilogy in interviews and critical essays. Potter would also later tell Fuller that he considered Where Adam Stood to be amongst the \\"most satisfying\\" of his plays.Graham Fuller (Ed.), Potter on Potter, 1993, pp. 55, 141. Where Adam Stood, however, was written at a very difficult time for Potter. In 1974, his father died and this, coupled with a severe bout of psoriatic arthropathy, led to Potter developing writer's block. Double Dare was a reflection on the problems he was having writing, while Brimstone was written in response to the ravages of his debilitating illness; Where Adam Stood was Potter's reflection on the communication problems he faced in his relationship with his father. Themes Where Adam Stood contains none of the non-naturalistic flourishes that have become synonymous with Potter's work, although it does contain a number of familiar tropes he would explore in other pieces. The fall is represented by Mary Teague's sexual attack on the young Edmund in the woods, which Potter later described as a \\"physical acknowledgement\\" that the world is not as innocent or good as Edmund had previously been led to believe. This sequence, which does not feature in Gosse's original book, is one of many that ties into the central theme of Edmund reclaiming himself from his father, who acts as the mouthpiece for an omniscient and unseen God. The boy's final act of using his prayers to deceive his father into allowing him to have the toy sailboat was, Potter explained, \\"a form of betrayal\\" and one that was \\"deeply rooted in [Philip Gosse's] religious language [...] He has observed the boy praying, but because his own faith has been tested he no longer knows what God expects of him anymore.\\" Historical background The drama includes a number of episodes derived from scenes described in Edmund Gosse's book. The nearest parallel to the story of the sailing boat is Gosse's description of his childhood prayer to have a \\"humming top\\", for which his parents told him was inappropriate to pray. He replied that his father had \\"said we ought to pray for things we needed, and I needed a humming top a great deal more more than I did the conversion of the heathen or the restitution of Jerusalem to the Jews, two objects of my nightly supplication which left me very cold.\\"Gosse, E, Father and Son: Biographical Recollections, 1908, third edition, p. 59; 37; 121. An episode in which a visitor is surprised to learn that young Edmund has never heard of Robin Hood is derived from a passage in which he states that his mother banned all fictional stories from the house on the grounds that fiction was a form of lies. He writes \\"I was familiar with humming-birds but had never heard of fairies. Jack the Giant Killer, Rumpelstiltskin and Robin Hood were not of my acquaintance\\". Edmund's description of his father's studies towards the publication of Omphalos place it in the context of the debates about Charles Lyell's geology, which emphasised that the earth was millions of years old, and recent work by various naturalists including Thomas Vernon Wollaston, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Alfred Russel Wallace. In the play, only Darwin's as-yet unpublished work is mentioned. Philip Gosse is visited to secure his support for it. This incident derives from the following passage in Father and Son: > In this period of intellectual ferment, as when a great political revolution > is being planned, many possible adherents were confidentially tested with > hints and encouraged to reveal their bias in a whisper. It was the notion of > Lyell, himself a great mover of men, that before the doctrine of natural > selection was given to a world which would be sure to lift up at it a howl > of execration, a certain body-guard of sound and experienced naturalists, > expert in the description of species, should be privately made aware of its > tenour. Among those who were thus initiated, or approached with a view > towards possible illumination, was my Father. He was spoken to by Hooker, > and later on by Darwin, after meetings of the Royal Society in the summer of > 1857. However Edmund makes it clear that Lyell's geology was the object his father's hatred, not Darwin himself, for whom he had \\"a profound esteem\\". In fact Darwin is never criticised in Omphalos, which is subtitled \\"an attempt to untie the geological knot\\". He is mentioned approvingly in passing twice, and Darwin's tutor Adam Sedgwick is described as \\"one of our most able and eloquent geologists\\".Omphalos p98. Sedgwick was an old earth creationist who believed that God had miraculously created and then caused the extinction of separate immutable species in sequence over millions of years as a sign of his power. Evolutionary theory is only briefly mentioned when the 1844 evolutionary tract Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation is dismissed because \\"this writer has hatched a scheme by which the immediate ancestor of Adam was a Chimpanzee and his remote ancestor a Maggot!\\".Omphalos: an attempt to untie the geological knot, London, Voorst, 1857, p. 27. The role of Charles Kingsley in the drama derives from a letter he wrote to Gosse senior, cited by Edmund, in which he stated: > Shall I tell you the truth? It is best. Your book is the first that ever > made me doubt, and I fear it will make hundreds do so. Your book tends to > prove this ‚Äì that if we accept the fact of absolute creation, God becomes > Deus quidam deceptor [‚ÄòGod who is sometimes a deceiver‚Äô]. I do not mean > merely in the case of fossils which pretend to be the bones of dead animals; > but in the one single case of your newly created scars on the pandanus > trunk, your newly created Adam's navel, you make God tell a lie. It is not > my reason, but my conscience which revolts here ... I cannot ... believe > that God has written on the rocks one enormous and superfluous lie for all > mankind.Garrett Hardin, Naked Emperors, Essays of a Taboo-Stalker, William > Kaufmann Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA 1982. In the play, the use of the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" is attributed to Darwin; in reality it was first coined by Herbert Spencer in his Principals of Biology (1864). Intertextuality Although Where Adam Stood is set on the Devonshire coast, the townsfolk appear to speak with Potter's native Forest of Dean dialect; this is used many times in Potter's original works. 'Mary Teague' appears, in name if not in person, in several Potter plays. In A Beast With Two Backs (1968) she is a miner's wife, whose husband's infidelity drives the play's narrative. She is also referred to in Cream in My Coffee (1980), when the curmudgeonly Bernard Wilsher (played by Lionel Jeffries) reminisces about a 'Mrs Teague' who used to live in his village; describing her as a \\"mad old woman with a cat\\". The biblical passage Edmund attempts to memorise throughout the course of the play is the Epistle of St Paul to the Philippians. Potter had previously used this passage as the centrepiece to his 1972 drama Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Broadcast The play was broadcast on BBC 2 on 21 April 1976. It was not repeated until 2005 as part of BBC Four's Potter season, marking the tenth anniversary of his death. A request for a much earlier repeat had come from an unexpected source. Potter's critic, morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, greatly enjoyed the play and had requested a repeat on BBC 1 shortly after the original transmission. She wrote privately to Potter and the BBC conveying her appreciation.Ben Thompson (ed.)

Formed in 1997, the sole member is Wintherr, an alias of Tobias M√∂ckl, who also plays with Darkspace as Wroth. \\"Paysage d'Hiver\\" is French, meaning \\"landscape of winter\\"; indeed, their songs' lyrics address primarily winter, darkness, and astral projection. Wintherr has cited the Burzum albums Hvis lyset tar oss and Filosofem, among others, as an inspiration for his music. All of Paysage d'Hiver's own material is released through Kunsthall Produktionen, a label Wintherr runs together with Nimosh of the band Nordlicht. As described on the Kunsthall website, all of the band's releases are connected, in that they tell different pieces of a story describing a realm known as \\"Paysage d'Hiver\\", from which the band takes its name.  Musical style  Paysage d'Hiver's music is known for its extremely lo-fi, raw production style, while musically it tends to alternate between, or even combine, black metal and ambient music. M√∂ckl plays all the instruments, and tends to alternate between live and programmed drums based on what he feels like suits the music that he is making better. The production style is also a deliberate artistic decision by Wintherr as \\"the atmosphere is the most important aspect. So the sound is more of an artistic approach than anything else. This kind of sound really opens me up to the possibilities of the imagination than clear sounding instruments would.\\" Discography All of Paysage d'Hiver's releases prior to the 2020 album, Im Wald, are classified by the band as demos. All releases after the Steineiche CD-R were originally exclusively released on cassette and limited to 200 copies each, but were later re-released on CD in unlimited quantities. Schattengang, Die Festung and Paysage d'Hiver have also been released on vinyl, each limited to 300 copies. On the highly limited nature of the cassette and vinyl releases, Wintherr stated he considers them to be \\"collector's items,\\" with the CD versions making it easier for wider audiences to hear the music.

Philip the Contentious () (12 November 1503, Heidelberg - 4 July 1548, Heidelberg), a member of the Wittelsbach dynasty, was a titular Count Palatine of the Rhine and ruling Duke of Palatinate-Neuburg from 1505 to 1541. Life Philip was the youngest son of Ruprecht, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and his wife, Elisabeth of Bavaria- Landshut, daughter of George, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut. Conflicting with imperial law and the inheritance treaty with the dukes of Bavaria-Munich, Duke George had attempted to pass his lands of Bavaria-Landshut to his daughter Elisabeth. This led to the Landshut War of Succession in 1503, in which the forces of Elisabeth and her husband Rupert were defeated. Elisabeth and Rupert died in quick succession in the fall of 1504. In the Arbitration of Cologne in 1505, Emperor Maximilian I awarded as compensation for the territorial losses, a small state known as Palatinate-Neuburg (from the territories of Lower Bavaria) to the two sons of Elisabeth. Philip ruled this territory along with his older brother, Duke Otto Henry. In 1529, he successfully fought the Turks during the Siege of Vienna at the head of two regiments and was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece two years later. On 8 December 1539, Philip visited the court of King Henry VIII of England, with the hope of obtaining the hand of the King's daughter Lady Mary Tudor. This potential match was part of King Henry's plans of an alliance with the Protestant German Princes against the Emperor. For all his intents and purposes, Philip does seem to have been genuinely drawn to Lady Mary for herself. They met on 17 December in Hertford Castle, where he presented her with a gift and kissed her. Such familiarity gave rise to the belief that the two would wed, and the majority of the English court expected a wedding within the coming months. However, King Henry did not allow this match to succeed, due to the fact that the Duke was related to queen consort Anne of Cleves, Henry‚Äôs fourth wife. The Duke was both paternally and maternally her third cousin, sharing as ancestors Frederick II, Elector of Saxony, and Margarete of Austria. Surprisingly, given their differing religious views, Lady Mary showed affection towards the Duke, as she kissed him out of court. The Duke was later sent back to his land.James Gairdner. Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Volume 14 Part 2: August‚ÄìDecember 1539, 1895. The plan did not come to fruition. Philip, however, was not deterred, and he visited England three more times; but only once more did he get to see Lady Mary.

History 262x262px 262x262px It was built in around 1700 on Barkhor Tromshung Jang and was once a government building for officials such as the Ambans, representatives of the Qing emperor. It was built under the command of the 6th Dalai Lama (1683‚Äì1706) and is sometimes referred to as the 6th Dalai Lama's Palace. A widening of the Barkhor over a length of some 80 metres forms the space of the Barkor Tromshung Jang. The Tromzikhang was built on the sunny northern side of the Barkor Tromshung Jang (North Barkhor Square). The surviving, but still splendid, symmetrical, three-storied fa√ßade runs the whole length of this side of the square. Where Ramoche Lam (Barkhor Changtrom Sanlan) enters the Barkhor from the north there used to be a large stupa and mani wall, now both completely demolished. It was 40 metres at its widest and 20 metres at its narrowest.Larsen and Sinding-Larsen (2001), p. 93. Between 1938 and 1949, Tromzikhang was used as a Republican School, with a staff of Chinese, Hui and Tibetan teachers. It was built primarily for the local Chinese population of merchants with a number of staff from the Chinese Mission. Phuntsok Wangyal, a progressive pro-Communist Tibetan from Batang who founded the Tibetan Communist Party, also taught there for some time. The school taught pupils such as Gyalo Dondrup, the eldest brother of the 14th Dalai Lama as well as Nepalese and Muslim minorities living in Lhasa. The school was closed down in 1949 when the Chinese Mission was expelled from Tibet. Architecture Tromzikhang Market, Lhasa. The building is characterized by its length; it has a 63-metre (207 ft) facade. Architecturally it combines stylistic elements of monasteries and noble houses being symmetrical along a central axis, and hierarchical from down to up with large balconies and lavishly decorated interiors on the uppermost floor. The red \\"Pembe\\" stripe, located at the roof level, is used to signify that the residence was intended to be used by an incarnated lama. The interior of the complex was demolished in 1997‚Äì1998 by the Chinese government. Nevertheless, the Barkor Street facade was retained during the redevelopments, and the area is now a housing complex and notable market. Market Today Tromzikhang market sells items such as yak butter, cheese, tea, noodles, vegetables and candy. A July 1994 study revealed that some 70% of traders at the market are Chinese. Nearby is Tromzikhang Bus Station and a mosque and a small 15th century building housing a two-story image of the Maitreya, named the Jamkhang. Tromzikhang and the mosque were badly affected by the anti- government protests in 2008. NotesReferences *Larsen, Knud and Sinding-Larsen, Amund (2001).

Structure Their most well known product are various potato chips, branded as \\"Maarud Potetgull\\" (lit. 'potato gold'), but the company also produces other foods such as tortilla chips, peanuts, and popcorn. The company also has branches in Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states under the names \\"Estrella\\" and \\"Taffel\\" (in Lithuania). The Norwegian branch has the main office in Oslo and production facilities are at Disen√• in S√∏r-Odal. The Swedish company has the main office in Stockholm and production facilities at Angered. The Baltic division has production facilities in Kaunas, Lithuania. The company has 390 employees. History The company traces back to 1928, when Thomas Stang of the Maarud farm at Disen√• started selling farm products. Production of potato chips under the brand name \\"potetgull\\" started in 1936, after Stang had visited the United States. Around 1950, Maarud purchased industrial equipment for larger scale chip production, and the company enjoyed progress in the 1960s, helped by the advent of television. In the 1970s, Maarud became the largest snack food producer in Scandinavia. Thomas Stang's son Ole A. Stang, Jr. took over the company in 1960. The company was sold to Freia in 1983, and to Kraft Foods in 1992. After operating as a daughter company of Kraft for several years, the company merged with Kraft and Freia in 2002, becoming Kraft Foods Norge. Under Kraft, Maarud had trouble maintaining their position in the market. In the tough competition against KiMs, Maarud's share of the Norwegian potato chip market fell from 50% in 2001, to 33% in 2008, although the increase in consumption of snack foods meant that production at Maarud remained stable. In 2008, Kraft sold the company to the Norwegian private equity firm Herkules Capital. The sale was welcomed by both local and national politicians in Norway, as well as the employees of Maarud. In 2014, Herkules sold Estrella Maarud to the Intersnack Group , which combines various international brands of salted snacks.

Owen won a Welsh BAFTA in 2007 for the documentary The Aberfan Disaster which he co-produced with Judith Davies. As a teenager he was a Welsh Boys Club Boxing champion. In his later teens he was in the 1990s indie band The Pocket Devils as bass player and lead singer/songwriter. Signed to Sanctuary Records in the UK and Pop Music Records in the US they finally split after Owen landed the part of Richey in the Welsh drama series Nuts and Bolts in 1999. From Nuts and Bolts he landed parts in UK Network series including Murphy's Law with James Nesbitt and Dirty Work with Neil Pearson. His meeting with Irvine Welsh when filming the Gene video \\"Is it over?\\" proved pivotal in Owen's career. He has since worked with Welsh (and his writing partner Dean Cavanagh) on several dramas including Dose for the BBC, Wedding Belles for C4 and Good Arrows for ITV (which Owen also produced). His 2006 film Little White Lies won several film festival awards and was featured at the Moscow Film Festival. He played a BNP thug, receiving positive reviews. In 2007 he appeared as Banana Boat in Russell T Davies's Torchwood. Owen has also worked extensively as a writer and producer for ITV Wales, including winning the Gwyn Alf Williams Award at the Welsh BAFTAs for the 40th anniversary documentary of the Aberfan disaster. It was revealed during shooting that Owen's father had been one of the first Welsh miners on the scene in the recovery operation. Owen also did a piece for Cardiff City's appearance in the FA Cup final for Match of the Day in 2008. It received positive reviews in the media (The Guardian said it was the best part of the day's coverage) and from football fans across the country. In 2009 Owen appeared as regular character Ady in Channel 4's Shameless, and continued in the role in 2010. 2009 also saw the release of the independent film A Bit of Tom Jones?, with Owen in the lead role. The film spread from a limited release in Wales to being shown in selected markets throughout the UK by Vue. He is the writer and creator of Svengali, a cult internet series which the Evening Standard and NME called 'the best series on the net'. He plays the manager of an up-and-coming band. It is based on his own experiences in the music industry to the point that he named the character 'Dixie' after the manager of his own band. The female lead is played by Smack the Ponys Sally Phillips. Former Creation Records head Alan McGee plays the Svengali whom 'Dixie' pursues in an effort to get the band he manages signed. In 2013 Svengali was turned into a feature-length film, directed by John Hardwick and written by Jonny Owen. The film stars Owen, Martin Freeman, Vicky McClure, Matt Berry, Michael Socha, Michael Smiley and Natasha O'Keeffe, and is the debut release from Root Films. It was selected to show at the 67th Edinburgh International Film Festival. It was also nominated for the Michael Powell Award, a prize which honours the best British feature film.

The fort and battery is historically significant as an example of late nineteenth and early twentieth century military architecture and as one of two surviving coastal fortifications in the United States intact from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War era. Construction The construction of additional coastal batteries was authorized by Congress under the $50 million Harbor Fortification Defense Act of 1898 due to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Fort Fremont was built by the Corps of Engineers on condemned private property, with construction starting in 1899.NOTE: Former owners of portions of the condemned land were Ellen A. Crofut, F.A. Dran, Jacob Meyers, Jack Freeman, July Fripp, Andrew Jenkins and Ellen Williams. The Corps of Engineers hired labor from the Beaufort area to build the military complex. Details The fort was named after John C. Fremont, the first presidential candidate of the Republican Party in 1856. Later, Fremont was a Civil War general. The complex at Fort Fremont consisted of almost 170 acres of land with numerous outbuildings, including an Administration building, guard house, barracks, hospital, stable, mess hall, bakery, commissary, post exchange, lavatory, and water tower. The garrison's single artillery company manned three 10-inch disappearing guns and two 4.7-inch rapid fire guns. Much of the bastions and the concrete emplacements for the guns remain today.NOTE: The March 2, 1899 issue of The Palmetto Post told that \\"a large force of laborers\\" was at work on the fortifications, that the 4.7-inch guns had already been mounted, and the emplacements had been completed for the larger weapons. In 1900, Fort Fremont was turned over to the Coastal Artillery. Deactivation As early as 1906 the War Department gave serious consideration to the closing of Fort Fremont, due to budgetary constraints. Regarding reports that Fort Fremont would be sold or abandoned, the April 16, 1912 issue of the Beaufort Gazette quoted the Assistant Secretary of War: \\"... I have the honor to inform you that no such action is contemplated at present.\\" A small detachment of soldiers had been serving as caretakers at the fort after troops stationed there had been reassigned to Galveston the previous year. A December 7, 1921 Charleston News and Courier article reported that the U.S. Treasury Department requested Fort Fremont from the U.S. War Department for use as a quarantine station. The property had by then been placed on the Secretary of War's list of properties no longer needed for military purposes and available for sale. Fort Fremont was subsequently deactivated as a military installation in 1921. The fort was decommissioned and sold at public auction by the War Department in 1930. The Fort Fremont Battery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 5, 2010. Today the Fort is a Historical Preserve. Only the 10 inch battery, the rapid-fire battery, and the brick hospital built in 1906 survive. All the other structures were made of wood and were demolished at various points before 1989, when documentation was submitted to the NRHP. The documentation states that \\"Fort Fremont is one of only two extant Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War fortifications which retain their character from that period.\\" Gallery File:Fort Fremont rear.jpgRear view of Fort Fremont File:Fort Fremont Plaque.jpgFront face of historical plaque File:Fort Fremont Plaque Rear.jpgRear face of historical plaque ReferencesExternal links * Images of Fort Fremont on Flickr * Category:Infrastructure completed in 1899 Category:Buildings and structures in Beaufort County, South Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Beaufort County, South Carolina Fremont Category:Artillery batteries Category:1899 establishments in South Carolina Fremont ","title":"Fort Fremont"},{"id":"24489071","text":"Timothy Michael Lenton FGS FLS FRSB (born July 1973) is Professor of Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter.

From 1872 until death he was a bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church in Edinburgh.  Early life  Cotterill was born in Ampton in 1812 into an ecclesiastical family of committed Church Evangelicals. His father, Joseph Cotterill (1780 ‚Äì 1858), was Rector of Blakeney, Norfolk, and a prebendary of Norwich Cathedral. His mother, Anne Boak, was a close friend of Hannah More. Educated at his father's old college, St John's College, Cambridge, he was both Senior Wrangler and headed the list of Classicists in 1835, on the strength of which he was elected as a Fellow of his college. Influenced by Charles Simeon, he was ordained in 1836 and went to India as Chaplain to the Madras Presidency the following year. Forced by malaria to return to England in 1846, he became inaugural Vice Principal and then the second Principal of Brighton College. In post less than six years, he reinvigorated the languishing infant school. In a whirlwind of energetic reform, he overhauled the curriculum by introducing the teaching of the sciences and oriental languages, restored discipline, launched a fund to build a chapel, built the first on-site boarding house and connected the school to the town's gas supply.  Bishop of Grahamstown  At the suggestion of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury and John Sumner, Archbishop of Canterbury, he was nominated and consecrated in 1856 as the second colonial Bishop of Grahamstown in South Africa. As was then customary, he was simultaneously created a Doctor of Divinity (DD). Cotterill was consecrated on 23 November 1856, and arrived in Grahamstown in May 1857. Bishop Cotterill's episcopate was occupied with the development and consolidation of his diocese, and with the institution of diocesan and provincial synods. The opening service of the first synod of the diocese was held in the Grahamstown Cathedral on 20 June 1860. It may be of interest to record that H. Blaine and F. Carlisle were the representatives of the Cathedral congregation at the synod. As one of the bishops of South Africa, he sat in judgement in December 1863 on John Colenso, Bishop of Natal, his college friend from Cambridge days.  Translation to Edinburgh  He was translated to Edinburgh in 1871 as coadjutor bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and was created a full diocesan bishop in 1872. During his time in Edinburgh he resided at 10 North Manor Place (later renumbered as 56 Manor Place), just north of his place of worship St Mary's Cathedral.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1880 He died in post in Edinburgh in 1886 and was buried between the choir stalls in the cathedral. His grave is covered by a large memorial brass made by Francis Skidmore of Coventry.  Family life  In 1836 he married Anna Isabella Parnther (1812-1899) who had been born in Jamaica. They had at least two daughters and four sons. The four boys all attended Brighton College. George Edward (1839 ‚Äì 1913), a Cambridge cricket blue and Sussex cricketer, was briefly Headmaster of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown (1863 ‚Äì 65) before returning to teach at Brighton College (1865 ‚Äì 81). Henry Bernard (1846 ‚Äì 1924) was an African missionary explorer and writer. Joseph Montagu Cotterill (1851 ‚Äì 1933) played cricket for Sussex and became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and was knighted. Arthur John (1849 ‚Äì 1915) was Engineer-in-Chief, Egyptian Railways. His brother George was on the teaching staff of Brighton College 1849 ‚Äì 51 before emigrating to New Zealand while, intriguingly, his youngest brother, James Henry, was a pupil at the school while he was the Principal.

The Bollingen Tower is a structure built by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. In appearance, it is a small castle with four towers. It is located in the village of Bollingen on the shore of the Obersee (upper lake) basin of Lake Z√ºrich. History Jung bought the land in 1922 after the death of his mother. In 1923 he built a two-storey round tower on this land. It was a stone structure suitable to be lived in. Additions to this tower were constructed in 1927, 1931, and 1935, resulting in a building that has four connected parts. A second storey was added to the 1927 addition after the death of Jung's wife in 1955, signifying \\"an extension of consciousness achieved in old age.\\" For much of his life Jung spent several months each year living at Bollingen. The Tower is now owned by a family trust and is not open to the public. The Bollingen Foundation, created in 1945 but inactive since 1968, was named after it. Inscribed cube The entrance to the Tower. In 1950, on the occasion of his 75th birthday, Jung set up a stone cube on the lakeshore, just west of the tower, inscribing it on three sides. One side contains a quote taken from the Rosarium philosophorum: A dedication is also inscribed on this side of the stone: ' (In memory of his 75th birthday, C.G. Jung out of gratitude made and set it up in the year 1950.) The second side of the cube depicts a Telesphorus figure, a homunculus bearing a lantern and wearing a hooded cape. It is surrounded by a Greek inscription: The inscription says: \\"Time is a child at play, gambling; a child's is the kingship\\" is a fragment attributed to Heraclitus. \\"He points the way to the gates of the sun and to the land of dreams\\" is a quote from the Odyssey (Book 24, Verse 12). It refers to Hermes the psychopomp, who leads away the spirits of the slain suitors. The second side also contains a four-part mandala of alchemical significance. The top quarter of the mandala is dedicated to Saturn, the bottom quarter to Mars, the left quarter to Sol-Jupiter [male], and the right quarter to Luna-Venus [female]. The third side of the cube is the side that faces the lake. It bears a Latin inscription of sayings which, Jung says, \\"are more or less quotations from alchemy.\\"Jung (1962), p. 230f. gives German translations of the inscriptions and attributes the Rosarium quote to Arnold of Villanova (d. 1311).

Most of his career was associated with Rio Ave, which he represented as both a player and manager, the latter in various spells. Playing career Born in Porto, Portugal, Brito played for three northern clubs during his 14-year professional career. After starting with local Boavista FC, where he could hardly get a game, he moved to neighbours S.C. Salgueiros. Brito's best year in the Primeira Liga came in the 1987‚Äì88 season, when he scored three goals while appearing in all 38 matches, but his team was eventually relegated after finishing in 19th position. He wrapped up his career with Rio Ave FC, helping the Vila do Conde side promote to the second division in 1991 ‚Äì his first year ‚Äì and retiring as a player at nearly 33. Coaching career In 1996, with Rio Ave back in the top flight, Brito replaced Henrique Calisto in the 14th round, eventually leading the club out of the relegation zone and coaching the team until the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign, which ended in relegation. After half a season at C.F. Estrela da Amadora and one year out of football, he returned to Rio Ave, helping it return to the top level. In summer 2005, after two further campaigns, Brito signed with another former team, Boavista, leading them to a final sixth position in the league and narrowly missing out on qualification to the UEFA Cup. In 2007‚Äì08, Brito worked with Leix√µes SC, being fired near the end of the season, with the Matosinhos side finally avoiding relegation. In January 2009 he replaced Jo√£o Eus√©bio at Rio Ave, thus returning for a third stint as a manager. Brito was fired at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 campaign after Rio Ave could only rank in 14th position, even though it was enough to preserve top division status. In March 2015, he returned to active with F.C. Penafiel, last-placed in the second tier. He kept the club from relegation, and quit his job on 2 December. Brito was back in the same league on 16 February 2016, when he signed for sixth-placed S.C. Freamunde for the rest of the season.

Background The Boeing 727-200 was built in 1974 with serial number 20982 and was equipped with three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 turbofan engines.Accident Database ¬ª Accident Synopsis ¬ª 09201976 Flight 452 was carrying 146 passengers and 8 crew members. Accident Flight 452 departed Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport at 22:45 Eastern European Time (EET) (20:45 UTC) for the one-hour flight to Antalya Airport in southern Turkey. At 23:11 EET, the first officer called the control tower at Antalya Airport to report that they had the runway lights in sight, even though the aircraft was actually still flying over Isparta, well to the north of Antalya. He requested an approach directly to Runway 36 (facing north) and immediately started to descend for final approach under visual flight rules instead of instrument flight rules without waiting for the clearance by the air traffic controller (ATC). The ATC asked the aircraft where it was going to land and warned that it was not in the region yet and it could neither be seen on the radar screen nor by naked eye. Seeing the lights of a long straight highway north of Isparta city, the first officer responded that he believed his own eyes, but mistook it for the runway. As the aircraft was at , the captain returned to the cockpit and became aware of the fact that the aircraft was descending onto a highway with truck traffic on it. He initiated a sudden climb with full power. However, the heavily loaded aircraft struck the slope of a hill at Karatepe with its right wing and crashed.

In 1860, she founded one of the first schools for the deaf and mute in her country: Tysta Skolan (Silent School) in Stockholm. Biography Johanna Berglind became an orphan early in life and was adopted by a widow: from about the age of ten, she was the ward of a relative of her late mother, Per Aron Borg, who was the pioneer of the education of deaf and mute in Sweden and the founder and principal of the Allm√§nna institutet f√∂r Blinda och D√∂fstumma (Public Institute of the Blind and Deaf) in Stockholm. Berglind suffered from a weak health for many years after having broken her leg at the age of three. From 1834 to 1840, she was a teacher at the institute the deaf and mute operated by Per Aron Borg. After the death of Borg in 1839, she supported herself as a governess, housekeeper and a lady's companion. Johanna Berglind had the ambition to found a school pension for the deaf, and saved her salary to finance it. In April 1860, she started the Tysta Skolan with the few students and one additional teacher that she could afford. The costs were to great for her small fund, however. In 1862, Fredrika Bremer described her work in the press and asked for contributions. This made the project known in the whole country and attracted a lot of attention from private benefactors: a school board was made and the school was given the protection of King Charles XV and Queen Louise and given governmental support. This made it possible for her to acquire a proper building for the school in 1866, and by 1872 the school was no longer in debt and reportedly filled a great need: in 1863, she had been forced to deny 75 students because of the costs. Johanna Berglind was described as a humble and warm personality, which gained a lot of support from private financiers because of her agreeable personality. She was described as a tender mother to her students, as one of her goals with the school had been to see to their emotional needs as well. As a pedagogue, she had been instructed in sign language by her mentor Per Aron Borg, and she preferred this method at her school: she did introduce speaking methods to her students in 1868, but did not consider it a success. She accepted students with an individual fee. She was the principal of the school from 1860‚Äì82. Her school was highly regarded: three of her female students were to serve as teachers at the later public schools for the elderly deaf and mute. In 1880, she was promised a governmental pension the day when she should retire. Berglind retired in September 1882. Awards She was given the royal medal in gold ¬ªF√∂r medborgerlig f√∂rtj√§nst¬ª (In Service of the State) and a pension from the state. The same year, she was made honorary chairperson in the Stockholm Deaf and Mute Society. See also * Caroline Yale ReferencesOther sources * Wilhelmina St√•lberg, P. G. Berg.

Its common name is berenjena. It can be found in Costa Rica's rainforest. It is only found in places where light is more abundant. Fruit When ripe the fruit is soft and the skin is bright orange. The flesh appears glazed, slightly translucent and the flesh becomes juicy. The unripe fruit is green and hard. Its flesh is a white to tan color and is solidified. Edibility When picking this fruit proceed with caution. Small needle like trichomes from the fruit can break off into skin, causing minor agitation. Before eating the fruit, first dip it in water then rub the skin against something hard and slightly abrasive (like a rock). This will remove the trichomes. The fruit is edible. The roots are used as medicine. Trichomes and spines The dermal tissue system of Solanum verrogeneum has interesting and distinguishable qualities. The apical and axillary buds along with the young leaves and flowers of the plant have large trichomes at higher densities than the rest of the shoot system. Spines are scattered around the stem and are easily noticed. Spines are present on the mature leaves as well but standout less. Covered on both sides of the leaf, these spines run perpendicular to and trail adjacently along the main veins. The spines follow or \\"trail\\" each other in a linear fashion, extending from the tip of the blade down to the petiole. Because of their inconspicuous location and unique arrangement, these spines have a tendency to be overlooked, especially by newcomers.

He made his League of Ireland debut for Dundalk, aged just 16 years and 307 days, with an injury-time appearance in a 3-0 defeat at Derry City on 4 September 2009, and went on to make a further seven appearances that season. These performances led to interest from a number of UK clubs. On 28 January 2010, he appeared for the FAI Schools U18 side in a 3-1 friendly win over Australia. Later in the year, he also played against Northern Ireland, Wales and England in the Centenary Shield. Under Ian Foster, he made a total of 13 appearances in all competitions for Dundalk in 2010, bringing his total senior outings for the club to 21. One of his 11 starts during the year was against CS Grevenmacher at the Stade Josy Barthel, Luxembourg City in the UEFA Europa League. Just over a month after the season ended, Nathan signed a one-year professional contract with the club. Due to a long-term injury to Eoghan Osborne, Nathan played a large part in the 2011 season, appearing in 43 of the club's 50 competitive games, of which he started 39. He is believed to be the youngest Dundalk player to reach 50 competitive appearances for the club, a feat he achieved against St. Patrick's Athletic at Richmond Park on 10 July when he was 18 years old. It was confirmed on 8 January 2012 that Murphy had signed a new one-year deal with Dundalk, and that he would be used as a left- winger that season.

Life Sofia Ahlbom was born in V√§ster√•s, the daughter of a goldsmith. She displayed an early talent in drawing as a child, and was tutored by the engraver Grandel in first drawing and later in engraving. After the death of her father in 1822, she and her sister Gustafva Ahlbom founded and managed a girls' school to support themselves and their mother. In parallel, she made engravings by commission for with clients among the city goldsmiths. A rich female benefactor admired her talent and advised her to move to the capital. In 1832, Sofia Ahlbom moved to Stockholm with her mother and sister, where she was able to support herself and her family solely as a professional artist: she never married, but lived with her mother and sister her entire life. She was described as a vivid personality with a practical and effective view on life: \\"A more bright look upon life and its circumstances, alongside a clearer mind and a more sensible head than that of mamsell Ahlbom, would be hard to find. She is, when it comes to business, so practical, that no male could be more so.\\"Wilhelmina St√•lberg, P. G. Berg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) Project Runeberg She died in Stockholm, aged 64. Engraver Sofia Ahlbom was first known most for her engravings in copper, silver and gold. From 1842 to 1843, she was active in Paris, where she performed several stone engravings for the artist Jacob. Eventually, she also added Lithography to her field of expertise. She was able to make several trips abroad to study the art work in which she specialized. Photographer Sofia Ahlbom was also active as a professional photographer. In 1864, it is mentioned that she had been a successful photographer for several years prior, but it does not mentioned the exact year when she debuted as such. Map maker Sofia Ahlbom was employed as a map maker by the Navigationsskolan (University of Navigation) in Stockholm. She performed the inscriptions for the medals of Stockholms Sl√∂jdskola (Stockholm Arts and Crafts School) and the Krigsakademien vid Karlberg (War Academy in Karlberg). She made the inscriptions for the heraldry book of the Swedish House of Lords (1861‚Äì64). Writer Sofia Ahlbom was also active as a writer, and produced publications in both poetry and prose. Described as a very learned autodidact, she was well considered in literary circles. Fredrika Bremer mentioned Sofia Ahlbom with respect in Livet i gamla v√§rlden (1862). Social issues Sofia Ahlbom also engaged herself in political issues. During the 1850s, one of the most debated issues regarding women's rights was the establishment of a retirement support system for professional female teachers, supported by the government. This was realized by the initiative of Josefina Deland by the Svenska l√§rarinnors pensionsf√∂rening (The Pension Fond for Female Teachers), in 1855, but the project was in great risk of never being realized because of the incompetence of the people responsible for it. Sofia Ahlbom succeeded Deland as secretary of the organisation after it had been approved by the government, a post she kept during the period of 1859‚Äì64. She was credited with having given it a firm organisation which saved the project from being disbanded.  References  * Wilhelmina St√•lberg, P. G.

Vitsut was born in Tallinn and belongs to the Estonian Centre Party.  Bronze Soldier  The decision of the Estonian government to remove the memorial and the remnants of the 13 Soviet soldiers to a military cemetery on the outskirts of Tallinn sparked off protest by the Russian-speaking population in Estonia at the end of April 2007. The protests of the defenders of the statue turned into riots with the police during the attempt to dismantle the memorial overnight. The Russian parliament threatened Estonia with trade sanctions and with breaking off diplomatic relations and pro-Putin activists picketed the Estonian embassy in Moscow.The Bronze Nights.

In the round table were represented all lobby groups of the Bronze Soldier topic: the veterans of the German and Soviet armies, a small group of Russophones Nochnoy Dozor (Night Watch), the Estonian nationalists, the representatives of Tallinn and Estonian Republic. As Vitsut lately remembered, this assembly was very quarrelsome: \\"The old veterans of both sides were calm and wanted to resolve this case quietly, trying together to find a new place for the statue.

There is also a pre-school day care on campus. It is so named after the Shearwater bird; its local township, \\"Biggest Little Town in Australia\\", Mullumbimby, in New South Wales; and because it is based on the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. History The school was founded on 8 February 1993 as a small community Steiner School for the surrounding regional area. It was originally located in the home of Stan Stevens and Sally Davison, offering Kindergarten, year 1 and year 2. The classes grew too large and the school was soon moved to a new property and the current location in September 1993, with the installation of an administration centre and several primary school buildings. After several stages of construction, the school developed into a complete primary to secondary (K-12) college. The most recent upgrade has been the construction of a 'state of the art' Performance Hall. Description A primary focus of the school's construction was ecological sustainability. The school is built around a creek that runs through the land on which the school is located; the geology of the land has been maintained with the buildings constructed around the naturally formed creek and hills. The administrative building, some primary rooms, and the school's library encircle a large fig tree which is supposed to be 50 years old. The school also has an on-site waste-water treatment centre. Upon the school's foundation at the current property, there has been extensive effort made towards the school's Rainforest Creek Regeneration Project, which is focused upon the local creek and its flora. Approximately 8000 native trees have been planted under the project. The school occasionally hosts festivals, most notably during the spring equinox. The school's largest annual project and a large source of income is the Wearable Arts Vision in Education. The Wearable Arts Performance Event is held on-campus and is held over several evenings with a variety of shows including fashion shows, dramatic works, and live music performances.

MCTs are expressed in nearly all kinds of cells. Lactate and the Cori cycle Lactate has long been considered a byproduct resulting from glucose breakdown through glycolysis during anaerobic metabolism. Glycolysis requires the coenzyme NAD+, and reduces it to NADH. As a means of regenerating NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue, lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol, oxidizing NADH to NAD+. Lactate is then transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver. There it is reformed into pyruvate and ultimately to glucose, which can travel back to the peripheral tissues, completing the Cori cycle. Thus, lactate has traditionally been considered a toxic metabolic byproduct that could give rise to fatigue and muscle pain during anaerobic respiration. Lactate can be thought of essentially as payment for \\"oxygen debt\\", defined by Hill and Lupton as the \\"total amount of oxygen used, after cessation of exercise in recovery there from\\". Clinical significance Highly malignant tumors rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis (metabolism of glucose to lactic acid even under presence of oxygen; Warburg effect) and thus need to efflux lactic acid via MCTs to the tumor micro-environment to maintain a robust glycolytic flux and to prevent the tumor from being \\"pickled to death\\". The MCTs have been successfully targeted in pre-clinical studies using RNAi and a small-molecule inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ACCA; CHC) to show that inhibiting lactic acid efflux is a very effective therapeutic strategy against highly glycolytic malignant tumors.Colen, CB, PhD Thesis (2005) http://elibrary.wayne.edu/record=b3043899~S47 See also Monocarboxylate transporters: References Category:Transmembrane transporters ","title":"Monocarboxylate transporter"},{"id":"24489552","text":"In zoological nomenclature, an unavailable name is a name that does not conform to the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and that therefore is not available for use as a valid name for a taxon.

The Nautilus 39(2): 69-70.2400 years of malacology at) was a malacologist in New Zealand.  Biography  He received a secondary-school education, and afterwards travelled widely with Captain Shuttleworth, of Wanganui. He spent some years subsequent to 1888 in farming near Wanganui, but in 1892 he went to Sydney and studied Mollusca with Mr. Charles Hedley. Soon afterwards he entered commercial life, which he followed until his death on 11 November 1923. He had a kind and sympathetic nature and it gained for him a multitude of friends throughout the country.  Scientific work  For many years Murdoch devoted all of his spare time to the study of the New Zealand Mollusca. He was several times a contributor to Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute and to the Journal of the Malacological Society. At the time of his sudden and unexpected death, he had arranged to give up business life and devote himself solely to research. During a visit to England about 1914, his important and extensive collections, which included several type specimens of New Zealand Mollusca, were destroyed in a fire. Murdoch was unmarried, and was well known as a prominent Freemason. Murdoch cooperated with the geologist Patrick Marshall on fossil molluscs. The generic name Murdochia is in honor of him. He formally named and described some species of sea snails, marine gastropods, including: * Peculator hedleyi (Murdoch, 1905) * Acirsa subcarinata (Murdoch & Suter, 1906)  Bibliography  * (1894) \\"Notes on the variation and habits of Schizoglossa novoseelandica\\".

He was master of the imperial mint at Graz in the Duchy of Styria and financier to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. He was a man cut of the same cloth as the likes of the Burgundian chancellor Nicolas Rolin, French merchant Jacques Coeur and the Medici of Italy, whose cunning, ambition and skills allowed them to advance into the ranks of the nobility from mere common ancestry in the late Middle Ages and early modern era. His activities laid an important foundation stone for the ascension of the House of Eggenberg. Biography The exact date of birth of Balthasar Eggenberger has been lost but he was born the son of Ulrich Eggenberger sometime in the early to mid-15th century. Like most successful men of the era, Balthasar displayed the contrary character of being, on the one hand, an unscrupulous and ambitious merchant, while on the other, being extremely pious. In 1451, to help secure the salvation of his immortal soul, he established the Eckennperger Stift. This was a hospital for the poor to which he later funded the addition of a small Chapel of All Saints and a family crypt. He was a cunning businessman who laid the foundations for the ascension of the merchant house to a noble house through his friendship with king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. Although Corvinus was an arch-rival of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, Balthasar also succeeded in the court of the emperor as his chief financier and master of the imperial mint. In 1460 Balthasar bought land on the western outskirts of the town of Graz and established the family residence there with the minting business as well as dedicating a Gothic chapel to the Virgin Mary which was recognized in a papal indulgence dated 30 May 1470. But, like Jacques Coeur, Eggenberger's fall from power when he lost favor with the emperor was as dramatic as his rise through his friendship with Matthias Corvinus had been. Origin of the Eggenberg Coat of arms The earliest known references to a coat of arms for the House of Eggenberg can be traced back to 1479. The coat-of-arms consists of a shield with three crowned ravens bearing a crown in their beaks. The ravens are thought to have been included as a reference to the King of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, whose last name in Latin translates as \\"raven\\" and who likely granted the merchant the already noble coat of arms.Becker, U.>Becker, U. ‚ÄúBalthasar Eggenberger and his estate near Graz‚Äù in Schloss Eggenberg. Graz: Christian Brandst√§tter Verlag, 2006, p. 12. The coat of arms appears at various sites throughout central Europe that once were in the possession of the Eggenberg's. This includes on Balthasar's tombstone, contrary to all convention of the time for those not born into the nobility. This tombstone can be seen today in the Gothic chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary at the heart of Schloss Eggenberg alongside the more- than-500-year-old Eggenberger altarpiece which Balthasar commissioned for his private chapel. Mint master and financier to the emperor In the 1450s Balthasar became financier to Frederick III finally establishing the family business of minting somewhere along the Sackstra√üe in Graz. The emperor deeded him land and, by 1460, he had established the family residence at the \\"Castrum Eckenperg\\" on the western outskirts of Graz. As a private entrepreneur leasing the business of minting the imperial currency from the emperor, Eggenberg made a profit only if the value of the coins as currency was higher than the cost of production. When the emperor raised taxes or prices or the cost of the lease, this cut into Eggenberger's profits. Therefore, around 1459, as a profit oriented business man in the days of protocapitalism, he reduced the amount of silver in the coins to such a low level that the coins became nearly worthless; all the while Eggenberger managed to amass a large private fortune. The people took to calling the worthless coins \\"Schinderling\\" and farmers would no longer accept them as currency. This precipitated a financial collapse and forced the emperor to attempt to seize Eggenberger, who had heard about the warrant and fled with very large sums of money in that time, nearly 40,000 pound, to Venice in the early part of 1460. However, Eggenberger and the emperor came to some sort of arrangement, the exact details of which have been lost to history, and in May 1460 Eggenberger returned to the family residence in Graz. He once again took up operations as the master of the mint for the emperor. He was, however, not able to stay within the good graces of the emperor for reasons that remain a mystery even today and died in the dungeons of the Schlossberg in 1493. Balthasar Eggenberger‚Äôs residence The medieval residence of Balthasar Eggenberger went on to become the core of the 17th-century palace, Schloss Eggenberg, built by Eggenberger's great-grandson, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. The former rooms of Balthasar now fittingly house the numismatic collections of the Styrian Universalmuseum Joanneum which now operates Eggenberg Palace as a park and museum.

It exited bankruptcy on March 31, 2011, only to be carved into four trusts; the first to settle the claims of unsecured creditors (), the second to handle environmental response for MLC's remaining assets, a third to handle present and future asbestos-related claims, and a fourth for litigation claims. Motors Liquidation Company's stock symbol was changed from GMGMQ to MTLQQ, effective July 15, 2009. MTLQQ stock was cancelled. Its unsecured creditors were issued stock for the Motors Liquidation Company General Unsecured Creditors Trust under the symbol MTLQU. History=Bankruptcy filing On the morning of June 1, 2009, Chevrolet- Saturn of Harlem, a dealership in Manhattan that was owned by GM itself, filed for bankruptcy protection there, followed in the same court by General Motors Corporation (the main GM in Detroit), GM's subsidiary Saturn LLC, and Saturn LLC's subsidiary Saturn Distribution Corporation. All cases were assigned to Judge Robert Gerber. The filing by the dealership declared General Motors to be a debtor in possession. The Manhattan dealership's filing allowed General Motors to file its own bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, its preferred court. Normally for such cases, the company would have filed in the courts located in the state(s) where the company is incorporated, or where it conducts operations, which for Detroit-headquartered General Motors would have been the courts in Michigan or Delaware, where it is incorporated. General Motors' attorneys, however, preferred to file in the federal courts in New York, because those courts have a reputation for expertise in bankruptcy. In a press conference that began four hours and eighteen minutes after the filing, the GM Chief Executive Officer, Fritz Henderson, stressed that he intended for the bankruptcy process to move quickly. In addition to Henderson's press conference, President of the United States Barack Obama made a speech from the White House four hours three minutes after the court filing. Obligation to privately owned individual franchise dealerships Prior to General Motors bankruptcy filing, U.S. state law governed the minimum required distance between same-franchise dealers; known as the eight-mile rule. The eight-mile rule prohibits same-franchise dealers from locating within eight miles of each other. In 2001 General Motors formally declared Project 2000 would be implemented as part of a brand- channeling strategy designed to consolidate its network of privately owned individual franchise dealerships and reduce the number of locations from 7,300 to 3,800. Project 2000 served as the primary mechanism for combining single- point Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealer locations together forming a single corporate brand division (BPG). Project 2000 also targeted single-point Cadillac-Hummer- Saab dealer locations and allowed single-point Chevrolet and Saturn dealer locations to stand on their own. Project 2000 calculated the fair market value for each individually owned dealer franchise to be $3,000 per vehicle based on total volume from any one of the previous three years. Upon agreement of a fair market value, dealers with interest in selling their franchise rights were free to negotiate with each other, and ultimately execute a buy-sell agreement which contained mutually agreed upon terms and conditions required to legally sell and transfer franchise property and ownership rights. Section 363 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code expedited General Motors Project 2000 efforts to reduce its dealer network and circumvent state and federal criminal laws prohibiting the illegal sale of property, or transfer of ownership by an unauthorized party. Thousands of family-owned, [profitable], well-capitalized dealerships were forced to forfeit their franchise rights to a neighboring dealer-competitor selected by General Motors. Compensation has not yet been awarded in cases where individual dealer franchise property and ownership rights were transferred for the purpose of granting such rights to a nearby dealer selected by General Motors. In addition to reports of fraud and theft filed with the police, GM dealers joined to form the Committee to Restore Dealer Rights. The committee to restore dealer rights is responsible for helping draft HR 2743, which asserts the action taken by General Motors to consolidate its dealer network by transferring individual dealer franchise ownership and property without compensation was illegal. HR 2743 remained in committee and it was not reintroduced in the next sessions. Court schedule and motions The General Motors bankruptcy case was formally entitled In re General Motors Corp., case number 09-50026 in the Southern District, Manhattan, New York. General Motors was represented by the New York specialist law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges. The United States Treasury and an ad hoc group of the bondholders of General Motors Corporation were also represented in court. One of the first motions filed in court was to void the leases on the seven corporate jets, and corporate aircraft hangar at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, which the company said were no longer valuable to the company's business. A GM spokesman said that the company had found itself unable to escape the lease in 2008 when it had tried to. On June 1, 2009, the court gave interim approval to GM's request to borrow $15 billion as debtor-in-possession financing, the company only having $2 billion cash in hand. The United States Treasury had argued in court that it was the only source of such debtor in possession funding, and that without the money from the loan General Motors would have no option but liquidation. Other motions in the first-day hearing included motions to approve payments to key suppliers and to employees and distributors who are in possession of goods manufactured for General Motors. All motions passed in court without substantial objection. The case schedule laid out by the court was as follows: *June 19, 2009: Deadline for filing all objections to the sale of General Motors. *June 22, 2009: Deadline for making competing bids in the auction of General Motors' assets. *June 25, 2009: Final hearing on the bankruptcy loan. *July 10, 2009: Deadline for completion of the sale, requested by the U.S. Treasury and General Motors. Sale of good assets to New GM GM's assets were sold in a section 363 sale. Because the price that these assets were expected to sell for was very high, there was expected to be only one bidder in the auction, a new company NGMCO Inc.GM 363 Asset Sale Approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court July 6, 2009.

This company had been formed by the United States government with a 60% stake, the federal government of Canada and provincial government of Ontario with a 12% stake, the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions with a 17.5% stake, and the unsecured bondholders of General Motors with a 10% stake. \\"Old GM\\" was renamed Motors Liquidation Company. A creditor meeting, at the New York Hilton, held by the United States Trustee Program, was scheduled for June 3, 2009. By December 2013, the US government sold the last of its GM stock. By February 2015, the Ontario government sold the last of its 4% stake in GM, and by April 2015, the Canadian federal government sold the last of its own 8% GM stake. Hummer collapse On June 1, 2009, GM announced that the Hummer brand would be discontinued. The following day GM announced that it had reached a deal to sell the brand to an undisclosed buyer. Later, on June 2, 2009, the buyer was disclosed to be China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd. Sichuan Tengzhong itself confirmed the deal on their website the same day. The proposed transaction was scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2009, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals; financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Chinese regulators refused to allow for the purchase of the brand and GM decided on February 24, 2010, to retire the brand. Despite the failed sale, GM discussed entertaining interest in part of the Hummer brand, subsequently made no effort in that direction, leaving Hummer to close. Failed sale of Saturn On June 5, 2009, GM announced that the Saturn brand would be sold to the Penske Automotive Group. GM would continue building the Aura, Outlook and Vue for Penske for two years. However, the Penske deal failed and the Saturn division became defunct. Sale of Saab to Spyker Cars On June 16, 2009, it was announced that Koenigsegg and a group of Norwegian investors planned to acquire the Saab brand from General Motors. GM would continue to supply architecture and powertrain technology for an unspecified amount of time. It also becomes the last brand/subsidiary from GM to be sold (Hummer was first, followed by Saturn). The deal failed on November 24, 2009.Koenigsegg backs out of deal to buy Saab AutoWeek (November 24, 2009) GM, however, requested Spyker Cars to acquire Saab from MLC a few weeks later.

History The national park originally was proclaimed as a State Forest in 1915 for timber located within the forest which was to be preserved for the town of Junee. A branch line from Mangoplah to Westby was located next to the state forest to carry timber but was later dismantled. A report by the New South Wales Forestry Commission found that the forest was only one of its type left, with further studies on the forest found a colony of squirrel gliders, which are the only two colonies left within southern New South Wales, three types of orchids and over 100 species of native birds. In 1976, the Wagga Wildlife and Conservation Society requested that the state forest to be gazetted as a national park after it was under threat however the request was turned down. In January 2001 the state forest was gazetted as a national park with an area of 1,919 hectares. Environment The park has four types of vegetation, including grass trees, mallee, kangaroo grass and open forest. It is part of the South-west Slopes of NSW Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of swift parrots and superb parrots.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: South- west Slopes of NSW. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-10-19. A variety of recreational activities are on offer in Livingstone National Park, including a multi-use track for walking, bike riding or horse riding.Erin Earth, Livingstone National Park http://www.erinearth.org.au/livingstone- national-park/ (visited 21.5.16)  Ecology = Flora  Livingstone National Park is a rare example of the landscape that existed in the South West Slopes area before agricultural development and it contains the only South West Slopes example of tall shrubland on a public reserve. Six separate types of vegetation are described in the Livingstone National Park and State Conservation Area Plan of Management, all of which are types of open forest and woodlands, with the exception of this tall shrubland community on the plateau tops. Livingstone provides a sanctuary for the vulnerable Yass Daisy Ammobium craspedioides, at the South western extent of its range. It also contains entire ecological communities which are considered endangered. The White box, Red box and Blakely's Red gum associations in the park are part of the Endangered Ecological Community known as White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Woodland. In the South West Slopes region large reserves like Livingstone National Park sit like islands in the middle of an extensively cleared landscape. When Benson described the condition of natural vegetation in NSW in 1991 he included the Western slopes as one of the most 'markedly altered' areas, due to its suitability for agriculture. Benson estimated that since settlement 90% of White Box ‚Äì Yellow Box- Blakely's Red Gum vegetation had been cleared and that which remained was being further degraded by grazing pressures. Benson points out that the Forestry Act of 1916 did play a role in protecting forests, and we know from the history above, that Livingstone exists due to its reservation for forestry, when much of the landscape was being changed. At the time of writing he described the Western Slopes Box Woodlands as one of the most poorly conserved native vegetation types in the state. Many authors,Cole, I. 2013. Controlling exotic annuals in degraded Box Gum woodland understoreys in south-east Australia. Thesis presented to Charles Sturt University. concerned with conservation, refer to Bensons work when they talk about the extent of the original clearing that has greatly pressured the viability of these Western slopes Box gum woodlands. These authors discuss how future management of this heavily cleared vegetation community can bring it back to a viable state. In 1995 Prober and Thiele examined the effect of grazing, reserve size and tree clearing on the health of these Western slopes Woodlands and found that larger areas supported a greater diversity of species, and thus, healthier communities, than smaller ones and that grazing heavily influenced the health of them. Most remaining areas of remnant Box gum Woodland vegetation were degraded by disturbances like clearing and introduced species and the fragmentation that has occurred by wholesale landscape changes to support farming, in such a rich agricultural area. Reserves, like Livingstone National Park, which have an intact tree layer and understorey or ground layer, with limited disturbance, are not very common. Furthermore, the size of Livingstone National Park and the diversity of vegetation types, and thus, the flora and fauna species its supports, makes this an important conservation reserve for the South West slopes. We see in the history above, that it was recognised early on that Livingstone was unique, it was described as only one of the remaining examples of this forest type left. The importance and potential for conservation offered by this reserve for declining woodland plants and animals, is even more obvious 100 years later. Even so, Livingstone National Park and State Conservation Area was not protected with National Park status until 2001, despite these requests in the 1970s. Examples of some types of Box gum woodlands are all but gone, such as the rare 'little disturbed' remnants of Grassy White Box Woodland, which are mainly confined to rural cemeteries where grazing and other disturbances have been minimal. This near removal of entire ecological communities, such as the South West Slopes Box gum Woodlands, can greatly pressure some individual species. These species now exist very sporadically, in tenuous populations, scattered over a large region. Examples of species which have been recorded in Livingstone National Park that now exist in isolated and vulnerable pockets, are the Yass daisy (Ammobium craspedioides) and the endangered Bush stone-curlew (Burhinus grallarius). Michael and Lindenmayer (2012) look at the idea of islands of habitat rising out of a vast cleared landscape of the South West Slopes, as they consider Rocky outcrops in the region. The rapid elevation of Rocky outcrops, rising out of the plains, creates a wide variety of habitat niches for great diversity. They describe a similar vegetation as Livingstone National Park (White box-Yellow box-Blakely's Red gum), along with the tall shrubland found on most outcrops. Michael and Lindenmayer discuss similar management challenges, to those faced by Livingstone National Park and highlighted by Prober and Thiele, when considering the improvement of condition for vulnerable species. The fact that Livingstone National Park is a large area in this cleared landscape means that natural processes can occur relatively unhampered and sanctuary is provided to threatened species. Livingstone's size means that it is less susceptible to problems experienced by smaller remnants, such as increased weed invasion and edge effects, whereby predators and weather effects infiltrate the edges of reserves and degrade them. However being an island of habitat in the middle of an agricultural matrix does present its own set of problems, especially for small vulnerable populations and those isolated pockets of species which are dwindling dangerously low across the landscape. Barriers to movement can decrease breeding opportunities for these populations, leading to reduced gene pools and further declining numbers.  Fauna  This large remnant of native vegetation, amongst productive farmland, forms part of the important feeding area for Swift parrots (Lathamus discolour) when they leave Tasmania each winter, for the mainland, in search of nectar and lerp insects.Saunders, D.L. and Tzaros, C.L. 2011. National Recovery Plan for the Swift Parrot Lathamus discolor, Birds Australia, Melbourne. The small population (less than 2500 individuals) has a huge area (1 250 000 km¬≤) and shows potential for site fidelity, or repeat visitation, meaning sites like Livingstone National Park, are vital areas for conserving this species. The Swift parrot is classified as endangered in both NSW and at a national level (under Commonwealth Environment and Biodiversity Protection Act 1999 and the NSW Threatened species conservation Act 1995). Along with international recognition under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2004). Identifying the habitat of, and monitoring its condition, is an important conservation action in the National recovery plan for the Swift Parrot. The protection status of Livingstone National Park means management is consistent with and intends to deliver the actions in recovery plans for conserving the Swift Parrots overwintering ground, when it leaves breeding grounds in Tasmania and disperses widely over the mainland, from Victoria to Queensland. Birdlife Australia coordinate a long running and successful volunteer monitoring program, which provides the resources to find the small number of birds over its widespread mainland habitat. This program can provide lessons for the conservation of wide-ranging migratory species such as the Swift parrot. It is conducted alongside the Regent Honeyeater National Recovery plan and monitoring program, as both species occupy a similar niche. The Regent Honeyeater is also an endangered species which uses the Livingstone National Park for part of its seasonal requirements. Ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon) is particularly important for the Swift Parrot and the fact that it has been selectively removed from the landscape in the South West Slopes, means that areas such as Livingstone National Park, which retain this vegetation type, are noted by Birdlife Australia for their habitat quality for this dwindling species. Birdlife Australia consider the South West Slopes an Important Bird Area, because of this overwintering habitat for the Swift Parrot. Livingstone National Park is also recognised within the South West Slopes Important Bird Area as breeding habitat for the Superb Parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), a vulnerable species. Birdlife Australia draws on research from Manning et al., (2004, 2006, and 2007) to show that the Superb Parrot is a species which presents some evidence of moving its range around in response to habitat change. The authors describe the South West slopes as an important habitat zone for this endemic species, and suggest this may be so due to degradation in other parts of its traditional breeding and foraging range. In this area (but not others), the Superb Parrot forages and nests in Box Gum Woodlands. The Superb Parrot is at home in the modified and cleared agricultural areas, due to its preference for scattered paddock trees. In the South West Slopes, the Superb Parrots favours Blakely's red gum trees (Eucalyptus blakelyi) that are dead, older and larger. Again the preservation of these preferred trees in Livingstone National Park and particularly the retention of dead trees due to its reserve status is important to this species in the landscape. The Superb Parrot, while able to potentially move in response to fluctuations, shows a repeat visitation pattern to nesting sites, or site fidelity. Even though it is tolerable of, and prefers the more scattered environment of the agricultural environment, the clearing of large hollow bearing trees, required for nesting has contributed to its decline. This preference for Blakely's Red Gum maybe due to this trees tendency to produces more hollows than other trees. Livingstone National Park and State Conservation Area, with a long history of preservation, allows the long timeframe needed to form hollows and replace them, in this production landscape. It offers some respite from the cleaning up sentiment that often sees dead trees and other important habitat components removed. The Bush Stone Curlew is another species left vulnerable by habitat destruction and this cleaning up tendency. It relies on litter and debri for camouflage at the vulnerable fledging stage and is highly susceptible to fox predation. Its presence in Livingstone National Park is also likely due to the retention of these features when they were being removed from much of the landscape.  Management  Climate change will inevitably bring new challenges to already pressured ecosystems, like Box gum Woodlands, and for Australia's vulnerable endemic species, such as regular visitors to Livingstone National Park, the Superb Parrot and the Swift Parrot. These species are already overwhelmed by fragmentation and changes to their habitat and Livingstone National Park provides a rare respite from these pressures, in such a heavily modified landscape which unfortunately does not provide the continuity of habitat needed for these species to flourish. When considering the role of Australia's protected reserve system on biodiversity conservation as climate change eventuates, Mackey, et al., expect the range shifts for various Australian species by mid-century to be in the vicinity of ten km. They highlight that some 45% of Australian vertebrates experience substantial reduction in some part of their natural range. Like other observations in the world the range of species is expected to contract with climate change predictions, follow movement patterns along latitudinal shifts, or follow pathways to higher elevations, in response to new temperature gradients. In their Australian reserve system review Mackey et al.., highlight the importance of intact habitat, movement pathways and refuges for species, as our climate changes more rapidly than ever before, due to human impacts. They use several Australian examples of refugia, including refuge for fire sensitive species. The potential for Rocky outcrops to provide refugia for fire sensitive species is discussed by Michael and Lindenmayer in their South West study, which encompasses habitat similar to that described in Livingstone National Park. Livingstone National Park has great potential as an area to harbour species as the climate progressively warms. It lies in the landscape between the Riverina Plains and the South West Slopes, an area which allows species to move along the west to east climate gradient and rise in elevation in response to range movement over time. Livingstone National Park, and other isolated pockets of vegetation in the South West Slopes, also form and important area of intermingling. There is distinct East, West and North South changes in vegetation as the different biogeographical regions of vegetation come together here. Such areas allow large scale natural processes to occur, relatively free from edge effects and substantial exotic species invasion. It is here that species can mix, adapt and evolve to meet this climate driven challenge, which will occur at a more rapid pace than in history. Livingstone National Park and State Conservation Area, with their somewhat accidental conservation history, are now important biodiversity refuge areas for the South West Slopes, as once widespread compositions of vegetation have been heavily cleared, to support what is now a vital food production landscape. Whilst current management supports the management of the reserve for threatened species and to protect natural values within the reserve, linkages to the outside may become the essential element for long term survival of many species as climate change pressures them. Vegetation corridor linkages and 'stepping stones' overcome problems with reduced genetic material, which can derail small populations. This occurs as species dwindle and even large areas, like Livingstone National Park, become isolated by cleared land, which flora and fauna are unable to move across. Neighbouring corridor linkages are lower on the priority scale for current management, even though this is recognised as a positive action in the Livingstone National Park Plan of Management. Working with neighbours and other agencies who would like to extend these connections are important and could be reconsidered in the Management Plan, to ensure these threatened species have the available landscape needed to see through the challenge of climate change. Along with protecting existing species; providing links for species to mix genetic material; reducing threatening processes, such as invasive and predatory species; and restoring landscape scale processes, such as ecological fire regimes, are all considered important steps to allow Australian species the space they need to develop local adaptions to climate change. Some of these vulnerable species present in Livingstone, like the Superb Parrot, show they are susceptible to the effects of a changed climate as they have a noted response to resources available due to weather effects.

Several subspecies are known - the nominate race T. n. nitidulus is found across eastern and northern Australia, specifically New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory, as well as New Guinea. Other species are found in Southeast Asia. Like all bees, the neon cuckoo bee is covered by furry, branched, flattened hair, which is responsible for both the black and blue colours.

The abdomen is striped with bright blue and black, and the transparent wings are purple-tinged brown in colour. The bee is sturdy in build, with a reinforced thorax. The female neon cuckoo bee seeks out the burrow nests of the blue-banded bee (Amegilla cingulata), and lays an egg into a partly completed brood cell while it is unguarded. The larval cuckoo bee then consumes the larder and later emerges from the cell.

Filmmaker Walt Campbell's documentary The Editor and the Dragon: Horace Carter Fights the Clan recounts Carter's account of his newspaper and his personal conflict with the local Klan. With audio recording and transcript of Brooke Gladstone conversation with documentary film-maker Walt Campbell. Early life and education Carter was born on January 20, 1921, in Albemarle, North Carolina. After graduating from high school, the first in his family to do so, he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At UNC, he worked as editor of the student paper. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, where he saw action in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Theater of Operations. The Tribune and the KKK After the completion of his military service, Carter was hired by the merchants association in Tabor City, North Carolina. With the connections he established there, he founded a weekly newspaper in 1946 called the Tabor City Tribune. In the July 26, 1950, issue of The Tribune, Carter wrote \\"An Editorial: No Excuse for KKK\\" in response to a July 22 parade by a Klan group through Tabor City, taking a strong stance against the Ku Klux Klan as an example of \\"outside-the-law operations that lead to dictatorships through fear and insecurity\\" and calling the group \\"the personification of Fascism and Nazism\\". The editorial was the first of more than 100 such newspaper pieces that Carter wrote in the three succeeding years expressing his fierce opposition to the Klan and its methods, providing details of rallies and Klan violence. The KKK didn't appreciate Carter's actions, and Thomas Hamilton, Grand Dragon of the Association of Carolina Klans, threatened his paper and its advertisers. Though he found some support in the local community, Carter's views were largely rejected by the community at large, leaving him and his family isolated. Carter's reporting led to the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the activities of the local Klan, leading to the convictions on both federal and state charges of many of its members, including Grand Dragon, Thomas Hamilton. Along with Willard Cole's Whiteville News Reporter, Carter's Tabor City Tribune won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing \\"their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities.\\" Personal After retiring from the newspaper business in the 1970s, Carter moved to Cross Creek, Florida. After a few decades of fishing and writing about the outdoors (the Library of Congress catalogs 12 books published 1980 to 2001), Carter returned to Tabor City and returned to The Tribune. The newspaper is still in circulation today, now called \\"The Tabor-Loris Tribune\\", and it is owned and operated by parent company Atlantic Packaging Corporation. Atlantic Packaging is also an independent packaging distribution and paper converting company with locations across the Southeast. Carter worked in the newspaper division of Atlantic in Tabor City, N.C., writing his weekly editorials, until a week before his death. Carter died at age 88 on September 16, 2009, of a heart attack while being transported to his Tabor City home from the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, North Carolina. He is survived by his third wife, the former Linda Duncan, and his son Rusty Carter, the current owner of Atlantic Packaging Corp, (www.atlanticpkg.com), along with two daughters Linda Metzger, Velda Kay Hughes, as well as 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. His first wife, Lucille, died of cancer in 1982, and his second marriage was ended by divorce.

History  TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of collective memory. Karl Marx  1981‚Äìpresent  TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the Rajk L√°szl√≥ College for Advanced Studies. However, in the beginning - before the fall of the Iron Curtain - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of Marx's ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: environmentalism, sustainability, postmodernism, anarchism, postmarxism, sociolinguistics, phenomenology, post-structuralism, Buddhist economics, feminism, sociology of minorities, queer studies, postcolonialism, network theory. The College also dealt with the topic of squatting, the sociological causes of poverty and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of critical theory/Frankfurt school among other colleges.  Philosophical principles = Criticism  TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program‚Äì among others, focusing on the social inequalities human resources, structuralism, neoliberalism, functionalism, corporatism inherently bares -. TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as critical mass, gay pride, many flashmobs, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-g8 anti-g20 demonstrations.  Commune  The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual commune, in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European capitalist societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.  Aims  TEK‚Äôs main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University. TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data. However members of TEK ‚Äì individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice ‚Äì e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.  Vocational work = Tutorials  The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule.

She was later widowed twice, with one of her husbands killed by Native Americans. Her third marriage was in Houston. Her original DeWitt Colony land grant is the oldest established tract completely within Belmont, preceding the Texan Revolution. Most of Belmont's urban facilities share the Ira Nash tract, a DeWitt colonial-tract, with rural Kingsbury in the northwest.

Fleming came to Texas before 1850 where he enlisted in Company C of the Texas Rangers Mounted Volunteers and later the Confederate Army during the Civil War. After the war, Fleming moved to Gonzales County. In partnership with Charles Erasmus Littlefield in 1871, Fleming purchased land on the Guadalupe River south bank in Belmont. Fleming erected a dog run-style cabin of black walnut logs where remnants can still be found. Fleming purchased his first horse known as \\"Old Billy\\" and used him to breed a line of quarter horses known as \\"Billys\\".

Professionals involved with troubled teens see the life of Natasha Cornett as a warning of the failures of the school, mental health, and criminal justice systems in preventive treatment.Helen Smith, The Scarred Heart: Understanding and Identifying Kids Who Kill, Callisto, 2000, . Early life Cornett was born into poverty in rural Pike County, located in Eastern Kentucky. Cornett's mother, Madonna Wallen, was not married to her biological father, a local policeman named Roger Burgess with whom Madonna was having an affair. When Natasha was a toddler, Madonna left her husband, Ed Wallen, and raised Natasha alone as a single motherJesse Fox Mayshark, \\"A Blackened Rainbow: How do we make sense of the Lillelid murders?\\", Weekly Wire, 20 April 1998. in a ram- shackle trailerSix, Documentary released 2003 located in the outskirts of Pikeville, Kentucky. It is believed Natasha received little or no parental support (financial or social) from either her biological father or Madonna's ex-husband, whose name had been entered on her birth certificate. According to Tennessee court records, she grew up with \\"the lack of a father figure, and an irresponsible mother\\".Cornett vs State of Tennessee, Original Filed August 20, 2002 By junior high school, Cornett was alienated from most of her fellow pupils because of her unconventional behavior. She suffered from anorexia and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which went largely untreated due to lack of health insurance. By the time she entered high school, Cornett was being openly harassed and bullied by other students for her uncommon dress and conduct. Pleas for help by her were ignored by unsympathetic school authorities. Sometime during her freshman year of high school, Cornett dropped out. Cornett married a long-time friend named Stephen Cornett on her 17th birthday. Natasha told Women's Entertainment Network interviewers in a 2009 documentary that, when Stephen ended the marriage after about six months, she \\"caved in\\" emotionally and was psychologically devastated. She also indicated this failed relationship exacerbated her existing mental health problems.Women's Entertainment Television Network (WETV) Women Behind Bars Series, Original Airdate June 16, 2009 By the time of her marriage, Cornett had firmly embraced the Goth subculture, wearing black clothing and listening to dark \\"doom-ridden music\\", as well as exhibiting interest in the occult and witchcraft. During this period, Cornett was abusing drugs and alcohol and practicing self-mutilation, all of which she had been doing since her early teen years. Young people who were similarly inclined were drawn to Cornett, and she became the informal leader of the group. Lillelid murders On April 6, 1997, Cornett, then 18 years old, and five friends/fellow disaffected youths‚ÄîEdward Dean Mullins, 19; Joseph Lance Risner, 20; Crystal R. Sturgill, 18; Jason Blake Bryant, 14; and Karen R. Howell, 17‚Äîtook to the road in Joseph's beat-up Chevrolet Citation. They were hoping to start new lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Natasha had spent a few weeks visiting with a friend following the end of her marriage. While the over-arching reason for leaving was the desire of the group to escape what they saw as the stultifying boredom of life and dispiriting poverty they were experiencing in Pikeville, there was a more immediate motivation. The previous night (and not for the first time), Natasha had rented a room in a local economy lodging establishment, the Colley Motel (no longer in businessYellow Pages Online), for the purposes of drinking and smoking marijuana. The party got out of hand, and the next day, fearing possible criminal charges for damages done to the room, the group thought it best to leave town before possibly facing legal consequences related to property damage.Lillelid Murders Still Haunt East Tennessee, MSN News, April 3, 2017 Along the way, they met the Lillelid family at an interstate highway rest area in Greeneville, Tennessee: Norway-born Vidar Lillelid, 34; his Honduran-American wife Delfina, 28; their daughter Tabitha, 6; and son Peter, 2. The Lillelids were Jehovah's Witnesses, and they were dedicated to proselytizing their faith to others, including the young people they encountered at the rest area. Cornett and her friends wanted to steal the family's van, having already discussed possibly car-jacking a bigger and more dependable vehicle to replace their cramped and likely unreliable Citation. At gunpoint, the family was forced back into their van and ordered to drive to a deserted road in nearby Baileyton, Tennessee, where they were shot execution style by 14-year-old Jason Bryant and possibly other male members of the group; later court testimony differs on which other male members of the group participated in the shooting. After the shooting, the group abandoned their own vehicle and left in the Lillelid family's van. As a result of the murders, the group changed their plans, deciding to flee to Mexico instead of going to New Orleans. Soon after they drove off, police found Vidar and Delfina dead at the scene; Tabitha died after being transported to the hospital. Peter, who was found lying in a ditch, was the only survivor. He had been shot once in the torso and once through the eye. As a result of the shooting, he was left blind in one eye and permanently disabled. Two days after the shootings, the six perpetrators in the Lillelid family's stolen van were taken into custody by US Customs and Immigration officials in Arizona, having been ordered by Mexican police to return to the United States for entering Mexico without proper papers.Routine Call, Horrific Crime, Knoxville News, April 1, 2007Town of Greeneville TN Website, July 17, 1997 The trial Natasha and the others were transported to Greeneville, Tennessee, where they were booked into the local county jail awaiting trial on charges of first degree murder, attempted murder, and kidnapping. Cornett accepted the volunteered pro bono legal services of attorney Eric C. Conn, a lawyer specializing in Social Security disability cases, not criminal defense. At Conn's instruction, Natasha made public statements in which she called herself the \\"Daughter of Satan\\" and claimed involvement with devil worship in preparation for an insanity defense. The judge overseeing the trial felt that this was not in the best interests of the defendant, so he ordered Conn removed and replaced before the trial started. The trial began and proceeded, but before the case could go to the jury, the district attorney, Berkeley Bell, decided to offer a deal to the defendants: plead guilty and receive life without parole instead of risking execution if the jury found them guilty and then imposed the death penalty. On March 13, 1998, Natasha and her co- defendants pleaded guilty to all charges against them, thereby avoiding the possible death sentences for her and the three others who were 18 or older. Due to their status as minors, Howell and Risner were already ineligible for the death penalty, but they accepted the deal on advice on counsel. Town of Greeneville TN Website, March 13, 1998 Although Natasha took the plea bargain, court testimony established that she did not do the actual shooting of the four victims. During her own testimony, Cornett claimed she tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent the deaths.Town of Greeneville TN Website, March 12, 1998 In accordance with the agreement she had entered into, Natasha received three sentences of life without the possibility of parole and two additional sentences of 25 years‚Äîone each for attempted murder and kidnapping. Life in prison Since her arrival at the prison in Nashville, Cornett has earned her GED and a certification in cosmetology. In a 2007 article published in The Knoxville News-Sentinel, Madonna Wallen stated that her daughter serves as a mentor for some fellow inmates as they work to earn their GEDs. Involvement in attempted murder On August 24, 2001, Cornett and death row inmate Christa Pike allegedly attacked fellow prisoner Patricia Jones, nearly strangling Jones to death with a shoe lace, after Pike and Jones were placed in a holding cell with Cornett during a fire alarm.Women on Death Row, Tennessee Department of Correction.

It was originally described by F. Smith in 1854 as Saropoda bombiformis from a collection near the Richmond River in New South Wales, before being reclassified in the genus Amegilla in 1965. Its specific epithet bombiformis is Latin for \\"form of a bumblebee\\". Amegilla bombiformis is a stocky bee which resembles a bumblebee in shape, and is covered in orange-brown fur. The abdomen has several dark hairless bands, seven in the case of males, six for females. It is similar in size to a European honeybee. Teddy bear bees have been recorded visiting Abelia, Buddleja, and blue flax lily (Dianella caerulea) flowers in the garden; males rest overnight attached to plant stems. They are found in eastern Australia, from Queensland through New South Wales and into Victoria, and as well as New Guinea and the Aru Islands to the north.Catalogue of hymenopterous insects collected by Mr. A. R. Wallace at the Islands of Aru and Key (fulltext) In 2017, A new species of teddy bear bee (Asarapoda) was discovered in the small town of Laura, Queensland. Identifiable by its unique bands that cover the bees abdomen. Most other species in this group do not have clear hair bands but are almost entirely fluffy orange-brown. The nest consists of several urn-shaped cells at the end of a 10 cm (4 in) long burrow, located in soil or earth, such as a creek bank in natural areas, or rubble in gardens, with some overhanging shelter. The cells themselves are 2 cm (0.8 in) long and lined with a waterproof material. The teddy bear bee adds an egg to each with a food supply of pollen and nectar paste. Nesting individuals of species are stalked by the domino cuckoo bee (Thyreus lugubris), which hovers silently and observes before entering unattended burrows and laying its own egg, the grub of which consumes the supplies meant for the teddy bear bee larvae. A research study published in 2010 by the Australian Journal of Entomology conducted research on the microbial pathogens that contribute to colony death among amegilla bombiformis, as well as other Australian bee species. They concluded that fungal microbial pathogens are a likely contributor to colony deaths among the various species. Through primarily spore germination, fungal pathogens may have been agents of the social evolution among Australian bee species.

The first two parts aired on Syfy in the United States on October 2, 2009, while the third part aired on October 9. In Canada, SPACE aired the first two in tandem with Syfy. Sky1 broadcast the first two parts on October 6, and the third on October 13, whilst Sci Fi Australia aired the two-parter on October 9, and the third part on October 16. \\"Air\\" was written by series creators Robert C. Cooper and Brad Wright, and was directed by Andy Mikita. In the episode a group of evacuees from Icarus Base, an offworld human outpost that fell under attack end up on the Destiny, an Ancient starship located several billion light-years from Earth. Their first problems involve the ship's failing life support system, where the new crew are tasked to fix it. The episode features some of the well known characters from Stargate SG-1, a previous series in the Stargate franchise. Parts of the third part are filmed on location in White Sands, New Mexico, which doubles as a desert planet. The first two parts were given generally positive reviews, mainly commending the cast and the style of the episode. The premiere was seen by over 2.3 million Americans, and was considered a ratings success in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.  Plot = Part 1  The majority of the first part takes place in flashbacks while a team of ill- equipped soldiers and scientists arrive at the Destiny. Eli Wallace (David Blue) solves a mathematical equation in an online computer game, planted there by Stargate Command. For his achievement, Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) recruit Wallace to the Icarus program, which is attempting to dial a nine-chevron address with the Stargate. Wallace's solution is the key to controlling the power levels for the Gate. He is taken aboard the Hammond, an Earth Daedalus-class starship, to be taken to the planet where Icarus is set up. During the journey, he meets Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque), daughter of Senator Alan Armstrong (Christopher McDonald). At the top-secret Icarus Base, the group is introduced to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed to be under the control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.  Part 2  The unlikely expedition team ends up on the Destiny, an Ancient starship located billions of light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him in charge of the expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, at the end of which the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.  Part 3  On the desert planet, the search begins for a suitable source of lime to filter the air on Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, but not enough to be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns. On the ship, Chloe and Young use the communication stones to contact Earth, allowing Chloe to inform her mother of her situation and Senator Armstrong's death. Young, meanwhile, is encouraged by O'Neill to repair the ship; in spite of his protests that their expedition is not cut out for it, O'Neill insists that no one really is ready for their kind of work. In his search for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, swirling cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses in front of a lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and that the best way to deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.  Production = Conception  \\"Air\\" first surfaced in December 2008 as a working title for the opening episode of Universe, where it was suggested to be a three-parter, according to executive producer Joseph Mallozzi. With casting concerned, several of the previous SG-1 characters made an appearance for the series premiere, including Michael Shanks, who reprises his role as Doctor Daniel Jackson in a cameo, Richard Dean Anderson as General Jack O'Neill, Gary Jones as Walter Harriman, Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter, Bill Dow as Doctor Bill Lee and Martin Christopher as Kevin Marks. Christopher McDonald of Happy Gilmore and Requiem for a Dream fame made a \\"pivotal\\" guest appearance as Senator Alan Armstrong, father of series regular, Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque). Another guest star is Ona Grauer, previously known for playing the Ancient Ayiana in Stargate SG-1's \\"Frozen\\" and Stargate Atlantis's \\"Rising\\".  Filming  Parts of the third episode were filmed on location in White Sands, New Mexico. \\"Air\\" was directed by Andy Mikita. When filming the first three episodes, Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper decided to hire the Director of Photography from The Shield. The shooting for the episode started on February 18, 2009. The show is filmed on stages 2, 4 (Destiny set) and 5 (Icarus Base set) at The Bridge Studios Previous franchise series Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis were filmed on stage 5 and 6. \\"Air (Part 3)\\" was filmed in and around Alamogordo, New Mexico from late April through early May 2009. A couple of scenes were deleted from the actual outtake, the two most notable being a scene with Eli Wallace (David Blue) on the desert planet and a flashbacks scene featuring Chloe Armstrong and her mother. The game Wallace played when solving the puzzle was a preview shot of Stargate Worlds, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the Stargate franchise. The game was referenced throughout the pilot. The announcement of Stargate Worlds marked the first bit of news published on the game's official website since May 26, 2009.  Reception = Ratings and viewership  The first two parts received a total household rating of 1.7, which represents 2.35 million viewers on Syfy, which was the best franchise's season premiere since the second season premiere of Stargate Atlantis. Among the figures, 1.32 million were viewed by adults in the 25-54 age demographic, and 1.12 million among the 18-49 demographic. Part 3 gathered 2.4 million viewers, a small increase from the season premiere. In both cases, the ratings were higher than Fox's Dollhouse, which aired on the same time slot. Plus the 7 DVR, the second part reached a household rating of 2.1, totalling 2.99 million viewers, including 1.7 million Adults 18-49 and 1.85 million Adults 25-54. This makes \\"Air\\" the most viewed Stargate episode since March 2005. After its premiere in Canada, the first two parts were seen by 565,000, which made it SPACE's most viewed single episode in its run. This also made Stargate Universe the number 1 non-sports speciality program of the day. Including the ratings from two additional airings the following day also totalled the ratings up to 2.3 million, comparable to the US release. In the United Kingdom, the first part was seen by 1.165 million viewers, while the second part were seen by 1.061 million, placing Stargate Universe the first and second most viewed series the week it aired on Sky1, and the UK's highest Stargate audience in five years. The third part was seen by 765,000 viewers, again making it the most watched programme on the multichannel TV station. The Sci Fi Channel Australia premiere of the episode attracted 149,000 viewers, becoming the second most watched episode that week, while being bested by a soccer match.  Critical reception  Reviews of the premiere were generally positive. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the premiere has received a \\"generally favorable\\" score of 61, based on 9 reviews. In all three cases the film ranks lowest in the series. Joseph Dilworth Jr. of Pop Culture Zoo praised the premiere of Stargate Universe, stating that it \\"feels less like a weekly TV series and much more like the beginning of a twenty part long form story,\\" and is also described as a cross between Star Trek: Voyager, Battlestar Galactica and Firefly, though the series seems to be a spiritual successor to Battlestar. Dilworth also praised the cast, stating it as \\"one of the finest ensemble casts I've seen in a long time.\\" Curt Wagner of Chicago Now rated the episode 4 stars out of four, stating that it shares the optimism of Star Trek: Voyager, and the grimness of Battlestar Galactica, as well as playing homage to its franchise forebears SG-1 and Atlantis, but looks and feels new. IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the episode 8.8 out of 10, starting his review with \\"Yes, it's another Stargate show. But this might become the best of them all.\\" Further saying the premiere had its \\"own unique tone.\\" Being one of the few Stargate franchise releases that were well received by major media publishers, Mike Hale from The New York Times was generally positive towards the pilot episodes, saying the Stargate franchise was \\"catching up\\" with the long- running Star Trek franchise. Hale also agreed with Syfy's promotion of it being an \\"edgier\\" Stargate. The Boston Globe reviewer Joanna Weiss also reacted positively towards the pilot episodes, saying it felt like \\"early Lost\\", while the story arc followed the patterns of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". Mark Wilson from About.com gave the episode four-and-a-half stars out of 5, saying Universe accomplishes what Stargate Atlantis was not able to, and said it was \\"exceptionally well made\\" compared to other shows. The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette both praised the show, calling it \\"intriguing\\", for not abandoning its premise as Star Trek: Voyager did and criticized it by pointing out that the characters spend \\"far too much time wandering a desert planet\\" in \\"Air (Part 3)\\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette summarized their review by saying that, \\"[g]iven time, Stargate Universe may become worth watching if it develops its characters and continues to mine its premise for stories.\\" David Hinckley, a reviewer from The New York Daily News gave the episodes four-out-of-five stars, saying that \\"Eli's not the only one playing a high-stakes game here.\\" Among reviewers who were negative towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune. The reviewer wrote that the \\"gloomy, underwhelming Universe seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous \\"Stargate\\" shows had, notably camaraderie and a sense of adventure, without adding much in the way of narrative suspense or complexity.\\" The only characters she felt were \\"worth following\\" were Eli Wallace (David Blue) and Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle). Vince Horiuchi from The Salt Lake Tribune started the review with \\"Syfy Channel -- is one of the worst displays of the genre on television,\\" and attacked the television series, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". Having no interest in the previous Stargate series' including the feature film, while not overall positive to the series, he said the cast and characters were a \\"little more likable and interesting.\\" Reviewer Laura Freis from Variety magazine concluded her review with \\"Sure, SGU is grittier, darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions. But so far, it's also a lot less fun.\\" While negative towards the show, she called Robert Carlyle an \\"excellent\\" actor. The Hollywood Reporter noted a lack of \\"intelligent\\" and \\"surprising stories\\" and was overall negative towards Stargate Universe, and even more so on the previous Stargate franchise releases. Awards and nominations In January 2010, the episodes were nominated for a Visual Effects Society Award for \\"Outstanding Visual Effects in a Broadcast Series\\", against Battlestar Galactica, V, Defying Gravity and Fringe. They were also nominated for four Leo Awards in 2010; one resulted in a win. Mike Banas was nominated for \\"Best Picture Editing for a Dramatic Series\\", James C. D. Robbins for \\"Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series\\", and James Bamford for \\"Best Stunt Coordination in a Dramatic Series.\\" Mark Savela and the special effects team won the Leo Award for \\"Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series\\" for their work in the episodes. In July 2010, the visual effects team were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects, along with \\"Space\\" for the upcoming 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Freemans offers a range of products, predominantly clothing, footwear and homewares.  History  The company was founded as Freemans & Co in 1905 by four partners, A.C. Rampton, W.E. Jones, S.C. Rampton and H.A. Freeman and began life with only twelve staff out of a terraced house based in Clapham, south London. Each member put up ¬£100 as capital to get the business going, . Freemans specialised in selling clothing items and distributed its catalogue each month throughout the United Kingdom. The initial catalogues were made up of black and white illustrations that reflected the available products. Of the product range the \\"made to measure\\" suits were a success, offering a cheap tailored opportunity for customers at the time, costing only 30 shillings, . The company used agency representatives in local areas as a form of credit control and to manage sales, with most goods being sold on credit. Women, however, were restricted by law as they could not negotiate credit arrangements and required a husband's signature to purchase goods. Therefore, the majority of agents were men. A year after it was founded, the newly named Freemans of London moved to larger premises at 215 Lavender Hill, Wandsworth. Company staff are affectionately nicknamed \\"The Lavender Hill Mob\\", some 45 years prior to the famous British film of the same name being made. In 1914 the company was forced to direct its efforts towards the war effort and, ceasing expansion plans, focus on buying blankets and selling them to the Government and the armed forces. The 1920s saw the introduction of colour photographs in the Freemans catalogues and the company continued to expand, with 200 people being employed by 1922. This led to another move, into a converted cinema that was formerly known as \\"the Gem\\", but saw the company remain in the Lavender Hill area of London. Freemans grew to dominate the mail order landscape in the 1930s, being the largest mail order company in the UK, with over 30,000 agents. Expansion also meant that the company needed to find larger premises; it moved to 139 Clapham Road, London, in 1937. By 1937 Freemans had expanded its product line to include important labour-saving household service items such as vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Now in new offices, it also became a privately held company. Being situated so close to London had unfortunate consequences during the Second World War as the Clapham offices were bombed, killing 23 members of staff and destroying all company records. However, the company continued to trade, now limited to a much smaller range of products due to the scarcity of suppliers and more essential use of raw materials. In fact the catalogue featured only clothing items, but these could now be purchased using the newly introduced coupon rate system. By the end of the war as rationing had taken full effect, clothing coupons were the only way to pay for clothes. Despite the staff count reducing to less than 300 by 1945, the 1950s was a period of boom for the mail order industry. New levels of disposable income as part of a \\"post-war\\" boom led to increased levels of consumerism and Freemans capitalised on this by producing a fully colourised 1000-page catalogue that was distributed by mail and featured a much wider range of products. The credit proposition was also giving Freemans a USP that wasn't available on the high street, and was also perhaps the primary reason catalogue shops such as Grattan, Littlewoods and Empire Stores did so well during this period. In 1963 Freemans PLC was floated on the stock market as it became a public limited company, and it installed its very first computer, being the first mail order company to do so. This was just one example of how Freemans built a name as the most pioneering mail order company in the UK, followed by the introduction of telephone ordering and digital catalogues. Looking further afield, Freemans opened a new international division, with the aim to break into the worldwide marketplace. The venture eventually made Freemans one of the 140 recipients of the Queens Award for Export Achievement in 1995. In 1969 the company required more warehouse space and opened an automated distribution centre in Peterborough, England. It became the first company to post goods in plastic packaging and was also the first UK company to generate heat from waste packaging. Once again Freemans looked at an innovative way to progress its business as it introduced a telephone ordering service for its agents. This was further developed five years later as a telephone system was introduced to deal with both customer and agent queries. Tony Rampton, grandson of one of the founders, served Freemans as Managing Director (1964‚Äì1965), Chairman (1965‚Äì1984) and President (1984‚Äì1988). Sears PLC In 1988 Freemans was purchased by Sears PLC (now known as the Arcadia group), whose other investments included bookmakers William Hill and the controlling arm of Selfridges, turning it into one of the country's largest retail organisations. It also meant that Freemans could now easily source and stock popular high street brands and promote them in its catalogue. Innovation In 1994 an interactive catalogue was produced and distributed on a CD. This was an innovative stage at a time for a business which over the past century had relied heavily on its paper catalogue. The idea won many awards for creativity and ingenuity, but was subsequently superseded by the presence of an online catalogue in the form of a company e-commerce website which was created in 1997. By then, Sears had sold Freemans, leaving them an independent company once again. In 1997 Littlewoods plc attempted to take over Freemans but the move was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the Board of Trade. However, within two years the company had attracted the attention of German mail order giant Otto Versand, which had already entered the UK market with the purchase of established mail order name Grattan in 1991. Initially, Freemans operations remained in London, but it was quickly integrated with the Bradford-based Grattan, not only utilising its head office at Anchor House, Ingleby Road, Bradford, but also warehousing in Peterborough and Bradford and a call centre in Sheffield. In 2005 Freemans revamped its website. This was the first in a number of moves to react to the increasing online business. By 2008 the brand logo had changed from Freemans to Freemans.com to reflect the doubling in online sales over the previous two years. A year later Freemans was presented an award by More magazine for \\"Most Aspirational Mail Order Catalogue\\" and by Prima magazine for \\"Best Mail Order Brand\\", a title it retained the following year. The parent company, now renamed Otto UK, announced a restructure of the UK-based business in 2009, bringing all its home shopping brands together under the brand Freemans Grattans Holdings (FGH) and utilising the popularity of the Freemans name in the UK. Sponsorship and celebrity endorsement Freemans embraced the concept of celebrity endorsement and elicited the help of one of the world's first international supermodels, Twiggy, to promote the brand in the 1960s. Pop icon Lulu began modelling for the Freemans catalogue in the 1970s and early 1980s as the brand looked to capture a boutique atmosphere but within the catalogue format. Lulu's brightness and bounce were the selling points for its young fashion. At the same time the catalogue offered Lulu the chance to promote her exclusive fashion range produced by Lenbry Fashions. The 1970s also saw star of the BBC sitcom Butterflies, Wendy Craig, model for the catalogue company. In the early 1980s, model and actress Lorraine Chase promoted the \\"Lorraine Chase Collection\\" through the Freemans catalogue. It also gave supermodel Yasmin Le Bon one of her first major modelling campaigns in the 1980s. TV presenter Des Lynam was chosen to promote the catalogue company's leisurewear in the early 1990s, securing a five-year deal. From 2007 to 2009, television and West End star Denise Van Outen promoted the catalogue's new \\"One Collection\\". Other celebrities associated with the brand include British swimmer and Olympic silver medallist Sharron Davies and Liverpool-born TV presenter Keith Chegwin. Freemans were shirt sponsors for local football team Bradford City AFC from 1991 to 1993; the shirt was made by Bukta in Bradford City's traditional claret and amber colours for the home shirt and a plain white for the away strip. The company also sponsored the Celebrity Mum of the Year Award in 2006, an award which was won by Sharon Osbourne. In popular culture The Clapham Road home of Freemans of London is featured on themed tours of London as one of the top industry-related places to visit in London. Alan Davies cited the Freemans catalogue in one of the jokes at his 2012 Edinburgh stand-up show, highlighting how renowned the catalogue's history remains amongst the mainstream population.

The park was established during 1998 and 1999 as part of Georgia‚Äôs Integrated Coastal Management Project, which was backed financially by the World Bank (WB) and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). Kolkheti National Park covers an area of 28,940 hectares and with protected wetlands protected area spans to 33710 hectares, incorporating the land of the former 500-hectare Kolkheti State Nature Reserve, which had been established in 1947, and its surrounding wetlands, including the lake Paliastomi. Paliastomi lake in Kolkheti National Park. History=Ancient history of Kolkheti Kolkheti National Park was once part of the tropical and partly subtropical zone of the Tertiary period that stretched over the continent of Eurasia. Around 2000 BC, the first Georgian state, Kolkheti, better known as \\"Colchis,\\" was created here and was the place in which the first Georgian coinage, ‚ÄúKolkhuri Tetri,‚Äù was minted. Colchis features in Greek mythology as the rim of the world, and has been mentioned in historical chronicles across western Asia and eastern Europe since ancient times. Colchis appears in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts and his pursuit of the Golden Fleece. Colchis was also the land where the mythological Prometheus was punished by being chained to a mountain while an eagle ate at his liver for revealing the secret of fire to humanity. Amazons also were said to be of Scythian origin from Colchis. The main mythical characters from Colchis are Ae√´tes, Idyia, Pasipha√´, Circe, Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. The advanced economy and favorable geographical and natural conditions of the area attracted the Milesian Greeks who colonized the Colchian coast, establishing trading posts in the area at Phasis, Gyenos, and Sukhumi in the 6th-5th centuries BC. These sites lay just outside the lands conquered by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. After the demise of the Persian Empire, a significant part of Colchis became known locally as Egrisi and was annexed to the recently created Kingdom of Iberia (Kartli) in c. 302 BC. This region retained a degree of independence until conquered in c. 101 BC by Mithridates VI of Pontus. The region became inhabited by a number of related but distinct tribes whose settlements lay chiefly along the shore of the Black Sea. Numbered amongst these were the Machelones, Heniochi, Zydretae, Apsilae, Lazi, Chalybes, Tabal, Tibareni, Mossynoeci, Macrones, Mushki and Marres.\\"Abkhaz\\", in The Annual of the Society for the Study of Caucasia, 3, 13-18, Chicago, 1991 During the rule of the Roman Empire, the Romans established major fortresses along the sea coast, but they found it increasingly difficult to maintain order. The lowlands and coastal area of what forms the marine area of the park today were frequently raided by the fierce mountainous tribes, with the Soani and Heniochi being the most powerful of them. In 69 AD, the people of Pontus and Colchis under Anicetus staged a major uprising against the Romans, who had grown increasingly weak during this time. By the 130s, the kingdoms of Machelones, Heniochi, Egrisi, Apsilia, Abasgia, and Sanigia had occupied the area from south to north. Goths, dwelling in the Crimea and looking for a new home, raided Colchis in 253, but they were repulsed with the help of the Roman garrison of Pitsunda. By the 3rd-4th centuries, most of the local kingdoms and principalities had been subjugated by the Lazic kings, and thereafter the country was generally referred to as Lazica (Egrisi). Modern history and developments In modern times, large-scale drainage undertaken by the Soviet authorities, especially in the 1920s to develop the economy, had a devastating impact on the wetland ecosystem and in 1947 led to a small 500-hectare reserve being established, called the Kolkheti State Nature Reserve. However, given that the surrounding wetlands contained much rich biogeographical and paleogeographical information of high importance to scientists and to Georgian national heritage, the area was granted RAMSAR status in 1996. This led to the Kolkheti National Park being formally established as a national park between 1998 and 1999, financially supported by the World Bank and the Global Environmental Facility. However, shortly after the park was established, construction began in 1999 on the privately funded Kulevi Oil Terminal within the park with the aim of creating 16 tanks with a capacity of 22,000 cubic meters each, serviced by a railway that would transport up to 35 million tons of oil through the National Park. Once completed, the 100,000-ton to 150,000-ton tankers would transport the oil through the reserve out of the Black Sea. Dredging of an access channel through the marine reserve had begun, ignoring the environment agreements made by the Georgian government, the World Bank and conservationists. Local and international NGOs petitioned against the oil terminal and Green Alternative, a Georgian NGO, were particularly active in the protests but without initial success. In the end, the construction of the Kulevi Terminal was abandoned in late 2002, reportedly because of financial reasons, but the marine area of the Kolkheti National Park still clashes with land permitted to oil and gas companies for oil exploitation, conflicting with the official designated protected area. Hydrology Landscape in Zugdidi District Over half the park, 15,742 hectares, consists of wetlands. Many small stagnant rivers including the Pichori River, Kukani River, Dedabera River, Tkhorina River, Tsia River, Tsiva River, Churia River, Munchia River, Mukhurjina River and other smaller streams flow through the park mainly through flat coastal plain at an average elevation of 0‚Äì10 metres. A narrow dune ridge, some 100-200-meters-wide has developed along the Black Sea shore that rises some 2-3m above the coastal plain. Much of the land is peat bog and marsh, some of which form several distinct peat bogs, including Anaklia, Churia, Nabada, Imnati, Maltakva, Grigoleti and Pichori which are located on the coastal plain. In places peat layers may exceed 12 meters in thickness, the result of clay, sand, silt and peat deposits over the last 4000 to 6000 years. In some areas the marsh is indunated completely with a number of lakes including Lake Paliastomi, Patara Paliastomi Lake, Imnati Lake and Parto Tskali Lake.  Climate  The climate of Kolkheti National Park is warm and humid climate and annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to 1600mm, relatively equal through the year. The park is subject to heavy periodical coastal winds and the coldest month, January can reach temperatures as low as 4.5 degrees Celsius. During the summer it is a moderate temperature, reaching 22 degrees Celsius in August on average. However, in August, temperatures have been known to reach as high as 34 degrees Celsius. Wildlife=Flora The climate of the park and abundance of water has resulted in a rich bioversity of flora in the coastal marshes and swamped forests and the deciduous wetland forest, is composed mostly of bearded alder, several species of willows and oaks and common ash. Drosera rotundifolia The coastal peat bogs are the home to many types of plants including sphagnum mosses, Drosera rotundifolia, Rhynchospora alba, Carex lasiocarpa and Menyanthes trifoliata. In the forests, evergreen undergrowth tends to grow such as Hedera colchica and endemic species such as Quercus imeretina, Quercus dshorochensis and Quercus hartwissiana, and Alnus barbata and Pterocarya pterocarpa are commonly found. Aquatic plants, such as Nymphaea alba are common around much of the hydrological habitats of the park while Rhododendron flavumRhododendron flavum and Rhododendron ponticum are known to grow away from the coast in the alpine area of Kolkheti National Park. Fauna Black stork The swamps and wetland forests of the park contain a number of endangered species such as roe deer, boar, otter and Triturus vittatus, and more recently a population of coypu has been introduced. It is home to the Caucasian subspecies of common treefrog and marsh frog (Rana ridibunda) and numerous types of snake, including ringed snake, dice snake, slowworm, and more rarely the Aesculapian snake. The European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis), and Artwin wood lizard are also found as are common and eastern crested newts. Several species of dolphins including Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncates and Phocoena phocoena inhabit the marine habitat of the park while 194 different bird species are found in the national park, including 21 species who use the area during seasonal migration. Some of the birds endemic to the park are on the IUCN and Georgian Red Book list because they are verging on extinction in the area, including the black stork, crane and great white egret. The great crested grebe, red-necked grebe, black- necked grebe, great cormorant, squacco heron, Eurasian spoonbill, glossy ibis, lesser white-fronted goose, ruddy shelduck, marsh sandpiper, great snipe, and a diversity of ducks, waders, coots, gulls and terns are common to the park during season and a number of white-tailed sea eagles have been recorded in the park, although these are very rare. Tourism Despite the protection of the park, the Georgian government has recently found a way to attract tourists whilst maintaining and protecting the natural habitat. The park was opened to tourists in 2007, attracting 1000 people in that year. Boating tours, notably on Lake Paliastomi and on the Pichori River are offered, as are diving, bird watching, hiking and horse riding. Boating trips in Kolkheti National Park include: Eco-Paddling on Flat Water Churia Nature Paddling (CNP) Trail The trail is suitable for the beginners in paddling and more oriented towards a relaxing day animated by the opportunity to learn about nature in Kolkheti National Park. Length: 9.2 km Paddling Time: 4‚Äì6 hours Difficulty: No expected difficulties Nature Interpretation: Discover the beauty of an Amazon like green weland. Fur stations will lead you along showing interesting features like common birds. A brochure with a lot of pictures, stories and background information is available at the Visitor Center. The CNP Trail is for beginners in paddling going over a distance of 9 kilometers. Without getting exhausted from paddling you can enjoy this beautiful landscape, completely flat, but you can see the lesser Caucasus at a distance in good weather conditions. It looks like you are somewhere in the Amazon in South America and you will be amazed about the diversity of different bird species, reptiles and of course the plants. Important: Please make sure you have learned the safety regulations before boarding the canoe! Churia Adventure Paddling (CAP) Trail This trail is good for the experienced in paddling and canoeing capable to paddle on a longer route, being interested to discover nature by themselves. Length: 10 km Paddling Time: 6‚Äì9 hours Difficulty: No difficulties are expected. Please be aware of changing weather conditions! Nature Interpretation: Living with water is the main theme of this trail. There are 4 stations where you can stop and discover new things. A brochure with a lot of pictures, stories and background information is available at the Visitor Center. You might imagine how in ancient Greek times the people of Colchis have paddled the Churia River with their large boats. Even Jason and his Argonauts might have used the RIver seeking after the Golden Fleece. Even today people are using the richness of the river‚Äôs fish diversity and make their living. Of course they compete with large bird fish hunters like the cormoran or the crane. There are smaller ones too, and if you are careful you might see a kingfisher hunting! This is a tour for experienced paddlers. You might be advised making this tour with a guide. He can explain all the values and stories of the area. It might be fun to also do some speed paddling, but make sure that you always have enough power to get back to the Visitor Center. Boat Tours Besides the Eco-Paddling Kolkheti National Park offers organized boat trips to several beautiful destinations. Paliastomi Lake Boating Time: 1 hour The route starts from the entrance of Paliastomi Lake. Tourists will see astonishing lakeshore scenery, impassable tall thickets of bulrush, secondary wet meadows and the thick cover of royal fern. From the birdwatching tower, one can observe migratory birds, some of which are rare species that seek out safe havens in the thickets of peatland vegetation. Paliastomi-Pichori Boating Time: 3 hours The route starts at the entrance of Paliastomi Lake. Tourists will see the beautiful shores of Paliastomi Lake and an amazing view of the Pichori River mouth. At the resting areas, tourists have the opportunity to see Kolkheti‚Äôs wetland relict forests that are spread along the river bank. Paliastomi-Pichori Boating Time: 2 hours This route offers tourists a beautiful view of the Pichori River mouth. While motor-boating through the forest, visitors often describe their experiences as if they were trenching through some sort of jungle. Sport fishing is permitted by the park administration.

History=Fogd√∂ Abbey In the 12th century a house of Benedictine nuns was established here, but its exact location is obscure. Excavations in 1991‚Äì92 revealed that a medieval fortification had been built on an elevation near the water, and it is possible that the nuns were displaced from their original place of settlement on this strategic site to make room for the fort. This would explain why they moved to what is now Fogd√∂ church, where the monastery was located from 1233. The church was used both as a parish church and as a monastic one, as is testified by an inset opening in the south wall - a so-called \\"nun's window\\" (\\"nunneporten\\"). The quire was also widened so as better to accommodate the nuns' choral liturgy. Judging from the surviving walls, the services of a builder trained in the Cistercian style were obtained for the project. In 1252 the abbey was sent a letter offering protection from, and sealed by, Birger Jarl and his son Valdemar, which is still preserved in the Riksarkivet.this document is now well known for containing the first known written reference to Stockholm by that name V√•rfruberga Abbey After 50 years the nuns moved again to the present Kungsberg (3 km east of Fogd√∂), where they were able to have built a full monastic complex in accordance with the Cistercian principles of monastery construction and layout. The new buildings were put into operation in 1289. At the same time the name of the community was changed to V√•rfruberga (\\"Mountain of Our Lady\\"), and was formally accepted into the Cistercian order, as a daughter house of Julita Abbey. The church was built in the shape of a Latin cross, with three aisles and a short transept. The nave was divided by a wall to separate the nuns from the lay congregation. The church was roofed with tiles, and the external walls may also have been tile-clad. During the Reformation of 1527, king Gustav Vasa dissolved the abbey and appropriated its property and estates to the crown in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden. He had the monastery buildings demolished to use as a source of stone for the construction of Gripsholm Castle. Parts of the walls survive.

Feelings of guilt governed my world view: postcolonial guilt, white guilt, middle-class guilt, British guilt. But if I was guilty, 9/11 shattered my innocence... For while I realized almost straight away that 9/11 would change the world, it would be several more years before I accepted that it had also changed me.\\" Reviews Ahmed Iqbal in The Independent wrote, \\"The chapters are entitled Shock, Shame, Anger, Denial and Guilt ‚Äì as if lifted from a textbook on popular psychology. The word \\"albeit\\" crops up throughout. The author's disillusionment with multiculturalism begins well before 9/11, when he reads a report on the future of cultural diversity in Britain compiled by men and women who are liberal in their outlook. It may sit well with Andrew Anthony to pronounce the death of multicultural society, but for those of us who have come here from other countries, multiculturalism cannot and must not fail.\\" John Lloyd wrote in The Observer, \\"The guilty liberalism he excoriates, in a book that retains a force and a passion and an insistence that you examine the thoughts you think that you think through some 300 finely written pages, is not a definition of the contemporary left, but a barrier to its development.\\" Nick Hornby in The Believer called it \\"A timely, pertinent, and brilliantly argued book about the crisis in left-liberalism.\\" Commentator Sunny Hundal, writing for The Guardian, described Anthony's view as \\"reductionist\\", adding that few people on the left actually hold the views being ascribed to them by the conservative writers who expound on the concept of \\"white guilt\\" and its implications.

The cuckoo clock, more than any other kind of timepiece, has often featured in literature, music, cinema, television, etc., in the Western culture, as a metaphor or allegory of innocence, childhood, old age, past, fun, mental disorder, etc. It has apparently been viewed more as a symbol or a toy -a folksy musical apparatus with animated figures- fascinating and a bit mysterious rather than as a serious timekeeper.Richard M√ºhe & Beatrice Techen, Beha Clocks in the Black Forest Manner.

Greene wrote in a letter: \\"What happened was that during the shooting of The Third Man it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\\" Welles said the lines came from \\"an old Hungarian play\\". The painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler had said, \\"The Swiss in their mountains... What more worthy people!

At the stroke of twelve, when the door on the cuckoo clock swings open he shoots the bird. He then tells her, \\"Like I said, there ain't no other time I can do it!\\" British comedian Eric Sykes frequently obtained humour from the cuckoo clock in his house in the 1970s sit-com Sykes.

He is the Chief Executive of Humanists UK and the President of Humanists International. He has worked for a number of civil and human rights organisations throughout his career in his capacity as executive committee member, director or trustee and has represented Humanist organisations before the House of Commons, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the United Nations. As a prominent spokesperson for the Humanist movement in the United Kingdom he is a frequent contributor to newspaper articles, news items, television and radio programmes and regularly speaks to Humanist and secular groups throughout Britain. Copson has contributed to several books on secularism and humanism and is the author of Secularism: Politics, Religion, and Freedom.  Early life  Copson was born on 19 November 1980 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, to David Copson and Julia Heather Cunningham. He was educated at the independent school King Henry VIII School, Coventry which he describes as secular in its outlook. From a working- class background, he went to the school as part of the government Assisted Places Scheme. He was brought up entirely without religion; as well as having non-religious parents, neither his grandparents nor his great-grandparents were religious and never had been. At secondary school, he first encountered Christianity, but rejected it when he did not see any truth in it. He attended Balliol College, University of Oxford, graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in Ancient and Modern History in 2004. He first joined the British Humanist Association in 2002 while at university: his mother had already been a member for some time. This was in response to a campaign the BHA was running at the time against the increase in the number of state schools run by religious organisations, or creationist academies. He began volunteering for both the British Humanist Association and the Citizenship Foundation, an organisation which aims to address democratic inequality on social, moral and political issues, after graduating from Oxford.  Positions  In 2005 Copson started working at Humanists UK, known at the time as the British Humanist Association (BHA) as director of education and public affairs. In December of the same year he won an award at the 2005 UK Young Education Programme, an organisation which promotes communication skills and rewards open debate on issues affecting society. In his role at the BHA he was responsible for campaigning for a secular state and promoting awareness of Humanism in schools and colleges and to the wider public. In 2010 he became Humanists UK's youngest ever Chief Executive at the age of 29, having been appointed to the Board of Trustees the previous November; a position which he described at the time as \\"obviously a daunting one\\", saying that he felt \\"a huge responsibility to build on the BHA's many successes.\\" He is a former director of the European Humanist Federation and has acted as representative of Humanist organisations to the United Nations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In 2015, Copson was elected as President of the International Humanist and Ethical Union,New President of the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Retrieved 2 February 2016 taking over from the award-winning Belgian Humanist Sonja Eggerickx. IHEU World Humanist Congress.

Pearce.  Views  Andrew Copson defining the terms 'humanism' and 'religion' at the European Skeptics Congress 2015. Copson is a regular contributor to New Humanist magazine, has written for The Guardian, New Statesman, The Times and The Independent, and has been interviewed on BBC News, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky for non-religious opinions on topics such as religious symbols in the workplace and euthanasia. He was one of the editors of The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Humanism, a collection of essays that explore Humanism as the way of life. He also contributed a foreword to Filling the Void: A Selection of Humanist and Atheist Poetry, edited by Jonathan M.S. Pearce in 2016, and contributed to The Case for Secularism: A neutral state in an open society, a collection of essays from the Humanist Philosophers Group in 2014. When asked whether his attitude to Humanism included scientific skepticism he said: \\"A Humanist is someone who puts human welfare and the welfare of other sentient beings at the centre of their morality. Humanism is characterised by skepticism and the scientific method.\\" Copson has also spoken widely on the subject of secularism, the separation of religion from the state, particularly in regard to children's education, civil ceremonies such as marriages and funerals, Human Rights law, against the automatic right of unelected Anglican bishops to sit in the House of Lords and the provision of religious chaplains in institutions such as the prison system and hospitals and hospices. He states his opinion as freedom of belief, that people should be free to believe whichever religion they choose and the law should not discriminate against a person because of those beliefs. Andrew Copson speaking in 2012. Along with biologist and author Richard Dawkins, Copson has questioned the need for \\"atheist churches\\", an idea posited by Alain de Botton in response to a Humanist debate over the idea of creating an atheist temple, and has expressed doubt in regards to future success of The Sunday Assembly. He has also spoken frequently in regard to state education in England and the provision of non-religious schools and evidence-based teaching, both in his capacity as Chief Executive of the BHA and as a lifelong Humanist. Copson commented: He considers collective worship and the teaching of religion in schools \\"one of the biggest education debates of our time.\\" Copson has also spoken publicly about the murders in Bangladesh of atheist bloggers Washiqur Rahman, Avijit Roy and the attack on his wife Rafida Ahmed, and Ananta Bijoy Das, calling on the Bangladeshi government to \\"do more to protect all its citizens from brutal fundamentalist thugs who would kill another human being for daring to think outside the confines of dogmatic religion.\\" He has also criticised the attempts of Nicolas Sarkozy in France to ban the burkini from French public beaches on the grounds that it disproportionately attacks women, demonises Muslim women specifically and is incompatible with religious freedom of choice. On the subject of his own non-religious beliefs, Copson has expressed unease with the way Humanism is often defined negatively by what one does not believe in, for example a lack of belief in god or gods and in 2016 said:  Personal life  In 2011, Copson entered into a civil partnership with Mark Wardrop.

A reclaimed brown field site, it was created after the local community objected to City of Toronto government plans to convert a former bus garage into a facility for storing City vehicles. The park opened in 1995 and now hosts several sporting fields, a farmer's market and a fieldhouse for community gatherings. History The location was first cleared in the 1800s for a farm. After the building of bordering rail lines, the site became a desirable location for industrial uses. Among these was a linseed oil factory as well as a factory for Dominion Bridge Company property at 289 Sorauren Avenue. The Toronto Transit Commission took over the factory and converted it into a bus garage on the site in the 1947, and used it until the 1960s, after which it became a repair and maintenance facility. The TTC stopped using the facility and it was contracted out for soundstage use for television series (one specific example being Captain Power). In the 1980s the City was planning to use the site to store trucks and other vehicles of its public works division. The community, notably local schools, rallied to cancel the plan and convert the site to open space, of which there was a lack in the area. City Council endorsed the plan to convert the bus garage site, clean it of toxins and build a park. The park construction did not remove the concrete floor of the bus garage; instead it was filled over with soil. The park cost $700,000 and was officially opened on September 17, 1995 by mayor Barbara Hall and councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. Facilities and usage Panorama of Sorauren Avenue Park The park has two mini-soccer fields for youth soccer, two tennis courts and one baseball diamond for sports. Open space is set aside for a dogs 'off-leash' area. In 2008, one of the former linseed oil buildings was converted to a fieldhouse, and is used for community meetings and community usage. In the wintertime, ice rinks are set up on the field. A farmer's market is held each Monday by the West-End Food Co-op, selling local produce, meat, baked goods, soaps and services. The market is held outdoors except in winter, when it moves inside the field house. After Halloween, neighbourhood residents bring their jack-o-lanterns for display for the one night following Halloween in the annual \\"Pumpkin Parade\\". The pumpkins are placed around the paths of the park and number in the hundreds. The pumpkins are then collected by a City of Toronto crew the following day to be composted. A pumpkin sale is held a few days before the event, with proceeds going to park services and improvements. The Wabash Building Society estimates that nearly 2,000 pumpkins are on display annually. Future community centre and improvements Former linseed oil factory The former linseed oil factory, on the south boundary of the park, along Wabash Avenue is currently vacant. It was purchased by the City with the intent to be converted to a community centre. The centre project is approved by the City, but the actual start date will take place when funds are allocated to the project. A \\"town square\\" was constructed in the area between the field house and the factory in 2014. Community fund-raising purchased much of the materials for the project, which was constructed by a contractor selected by the City of Toronto Parks Department. A noise barrier is scheduled to be built between the park and the adjoining rail lines. It is part of a Metrolinx transit project to provide a Union Station to Pearson Airport rail link. The lands of the oil factory are to be used as a staging area for noise barrier construction in the area of the park. Charles G. Williams Park Across Wabash Avenue from Sorauren Park is the small park of Charles G. Williams Park. The park has a children's playground and a strip of green space stretching from Wabash to Wright Avenue, behind the buildings of Sorauren Avenue. The park was created from two separate land purchases by the City of Toronto. The strip was first purchased from the purchase of a house on Wright to serve as a parkette. The second purchase, on the corner of Wabash and Sorauren, was the purchase of a warehouse by the city. The warehouse land was cleared and the playground was built. Williams Park was constructed before Sorauren Park. Holly Jones memorials Holly Maria Jones was a ten-year-old Toronto girl who was murdered by Michael Briere in 2003. Jones and her family lived in the neighbourhood, north of the park near Bloor Street. Her death touched the neighbourhood greatly and several memorials were placed in the two Sorauren parks. In the Williams parkette, a large mural was painted by Shaun Turnbull on the eastern wall. In Sorauren Avenue Park, a bench was dedicated, a tree was planted and a garden area was planted in her memory. An unsuccessful proposal was made to rename the Sorauren Avenue park to Holly Jones Park. A mural was also painted in Perth Avenue Parkette, north of Bloor Street by Olaf Schneider.
