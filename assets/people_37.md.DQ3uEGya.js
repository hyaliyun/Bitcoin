She specialises in old age psychiatry and dementia care.  Early life and education  Burn was born in Oxford. Whilst at school she joined the St John Ambulance brigade and spent her weekends administering first aid. She decided that she wanted to be a doctor at the age of two. Her parents were both doctors and her mother had been the first in her family to attend university. Whilst at school she joined the St John Ambulance brigade and spent her weekends administering first aid. Her grandfather was Joshua Harold Burn, a pharmacologist at the University of Oxford. She studied medicine at Southampton Medical School and joined the university theatre group. She became interest in punk rock, partied every night and failed her first year of medicine. She managed to turn her academic studies around, and passed the later years of her degree whilst acting as stage manager for the medical school revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In her second year she started a project on people who self-harm, and was surprised by the attitudes of staff to members of her patient groups. She eventually earned a medical degree and specialised in psychiatry. Her first placement was with Guy Edwards at the Southampton Medical School. She finished medical school in 1982 and completed house joins in medicine and surgery. She worked at Lymington Hospital and Southampton General Hospital. Her medical house job was with Charles George, a clinical pharmacologist who taught her about the importance of understanding the mechanism by which drugs work. In 1983 she started a senior house officer post in the Royal South Hants Hospital. She started to work in a Victorian asylum, Knowle Hospital, which had become and old people's home. She unsuccessfully applied to the training programme in psychiatry at Southampton and eventually started a research position with Guy Edwards where she assessed patients on medical wards following self harm. In 1985 she earned her Membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and started her career as an academic psychiatrist at the University of Leeds. Her first post was at High Royds Hospital, where she worked under the supervision of Richard Mindham and John Wattis.  Career  Burn was one of the first women to be appointed a Consultant in Old Age psychiatry at the University of Leeds in 1990. In her first consultant post she had to work with some of the most underserved communities in Leeds, the majority of her time spent on house visits. She was made Chair of the Senior House Officer programme in 1995. During this time she became more involved with the Royal College of Psychiatrists, becoming an examiner for the Part One examination. Her main research interest is in dementia and she sits on the national planning committees for dementia care. She was made Associate Medical Director for Doctors in Training at the University of Leeds in 2000. She eventually took over the clinical Part Two MRCPsych examinations, which involved finding psychiatric patients for candidates to interview. Soon after Burn became the Director of the Yorkshire Specialist Registrar Training Scheme in Old Age Psychiatry. At the time she became clinical lead for dementia in Yorkshire and the Humber and working closely with Alzheimer's Society. Burn has been consistently involved with postgraduate medical training, and established the Yorkshire School of Psychiatry. She was the first Head of the School of Psychiatry in 2007. In 2009 she joined forces with the University of Sheffield and formed the Yorkshire and the Humber School of Psychiatry. In 2011 Burn became Dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. At the time she became clinical lead for dementia in Yorkshire and the Humber and working closely with Alzheimer's Society. In her capacity as Dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists she coordinated clinical examinations, professional development and lead national recruitment. She has stopped the MRCPscyh examination from making a financial bonus and reduce the number of papers. She also oversaw the relocation of the Royal College of Psychiatrists from Belgrave Square to Aldgate. She handed the position over to Kate Lovett in 2016. Since 2016 Burn has led the Gatsby Foundation and Wellcome Trust Neuroscience Project, which looks to transform training for psychiatry trainees. The project looks to increase the neuroscience components of psychiatric training to make it meet modern mental health treatment requirements. The initial phase included a review of the current curricula of neuroscience and psychiatry, which made recommendations for a new curriculum. After the curriculum was finalised, approved and adopted, Burn has been responsible for assessing its impact. She was elected President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 2017. The focus of her presidency has been helping old people with depression, dementia and anxiety. She has also campaigned for more funding for the National Health Service and opportunities to increase mental health bed capacity. Burn identified that there are significant inequalities in mental health care across the United Kingdom, identifying that people in Wales had the worst access to specialist care. She serves as a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Health Group. In 2018 she was awarded an honorary award from the University of Leeds. She has written for the Guardian about the need for improved mental health services.  Personal life  Burn married her husband William in 1991. In 1993 she was the first consultant in the Psychiatry Unit at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust to take maternity leave for her son's birth. She had her second child, a daughter, in 1994.

It is found on the southern half of the island, south of the New Guinea highlands. It is named after Philip M. Hall, a researcher at the University of Florida who performed the initial studies to clarify the species' distinctiveness.  Taxonomy  The species was formerly considered a distinct population of the closely related New Guinea crocodile (C. novaeguineae), but genetic analysis as well as analysis of its skull structure (namely the postcrania and maxilla) has supported it being classified as its own species. The two species likely diverged within the last 3-8 million years, when the uplift of the New Guinea highlands created a barrier that divided them into separate populations; due to this relatively recent divergence, mtDNA analysis does not recover the two populations as distinct species, although phylogenetic analysis does. Despite the common ancestry of the two species, genetic analysis indicates that the New Guinea crocodile may be more closely related to the putative Borneo crocodile (C. raninus) than to Hall's New Guinea crocodile. This may indicate that C. novaeguinae and C. raninus diverged from each other even more recently than their ancestor did from C. halli, or that the specimen used for C. raninus was actually a misidentified C. novaeguinae.  Distribution  The species occurs in swamps, rivers, and lakes in the southern half of New Guinea. It is known to occasionally enter estuaries, such as the Fly River estuary. Variation is known from individuals across the range, with individuals from Lake Murray having a much wider skull than those from the Aramia River.  Behavior  The species nests during New Guinea's wet season (November - April), in contrast to C. novaeguineae, which nests near the end of the dry season (July - November).  In captivity  Three captive crocodiles at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park, formerly considered individuals of C. novaeguinae, were actually found to be C. halli while the study was being conducted. These were used to substantiate observed differences between C. halli and C. novaeguinae.

In January 1924, while gillnetting out of Two Harbors, Minnesota in Lake Superior, she was holed by ice, and sank with no fatalities. In 2004 her wreck was discovered in over of water in pristine condition. The wreck of Thomas Friant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History =Construction= Thomas Friant as a fish tug Thomas Friant was built as a ferry in 1884 by Duncan Robertson in Grand Haven, Michigan for Reuben & Ralph Vanderhoef, also of Grand Haven. Her wooden hull was long, her beam was wide (some sources state the width as ), and her hull was deep (some sources state her hull's depth as ). She had a gross register tonnage of 81.42 tons, and a net register tonnage of 46.20 tons. She was powered by a , 18 x 20 high pressure compound steam engine built by the Grand Haven Engine Works of Grand Haven, that was fired by a single firebox boiler that was built by the Johnson Brothers of Ferrysburg, Michigan. =Service history= On July 21, 1884 Thomas Friant was enrolled at Grand Haven, and was given the official number #145380. She originally ran as a ferry on the Grand River in Grand Haven. She later started to run between the ports of Charlevoix, Michigan, Harbor Springs, Michigan and Waukegan, Illinois in Lake Michigan, transporting passengers and freight. In 1890 Thomas Friants homeport was changed to Harbor Springs, Michigan. In 1899 her homeport was changed to Marquette, Michigan. In 1899 Thomas Friant was sold to William H. Rowe & James McRae of Dollar Bay, Michigan. In 1900 she started traveling the Keweenaw Waterway. In 1901 Thomas Friant had her lower decks closed-in in Calumet, Michigan. In 1903 she was bought by Charles A. Ripley, and was moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. In 1907 she was sold to Charles A. Ripley of Sault Ste. Marie. On December 22, 1908 while in winter layup in Sault Ste. Marie, Thomas Friant burned to the water's edge, and was removed from documentation on December 29, 1908. In 1911 she was rebuilt as a fish tug, and was sold to John, Henry & Thomas Hickler of Sault Ste. Marie. She was re-documented on May 15, 1911. In 1917 Thomas Friant was sold to Emil G. Endress of Sault Ste. Marie. in 1918 she was sold to Ora O. & Obline Endress of Sault Ste. Marie. In 1923 she was sold to Einer Miller & Halvor Reiten of Bayfield, Wisconsin, and was re-registered to Duluth, Minnesota. During this time, Thomas Friant had her decks enclosed, and her pilothouse raised. Miller and Reiten originally intended to use her as a packet steamer, but ended up using her as just a fish tug. =Final voyage= The last image taken of Thomas Friant On January 6, 1924, Thomas Friant left Port Wing, Wisconsin with Captain Einer Miller, Engineer Halvor Reiten and six commercial fishermen from Cornucopia, Wisconsin who hired Miller to take them to the south shore of Lake Superior to do some deep water fishing. The day was very cold, and the temperature eventually dropped below zero degrees, and a sheet of ice started forming over the lake. They eventually ended up taking shelter in Squaw Bay (a bay northwest of Cornucopia) for the night, but Thomas Friant froze in. Eventually, Thomas Friant broke free of the ice, but while she broke free, the ice punched a hole in her hull. They then started sailing up to the north end of Lake Superior, because the south shore was completely frozen over. Around south of Knife River, Minnesota, the water that was leaking into her hull extinguished her boiler, and she began to sink. The crew lowered a lifeboat and rowed safely to Knife River. Thomas Friant wreck =Discovery= In July 2004, while searching for the wreck of the bulk carrier , shipwreck hunters Jerry Eliason, Ken Merryman, Kraig Smith and Randy Beebe found what they thought to be Robert Wallace southeast of Two Harbors, Minnesota, in about of water. Originally, the group thought Thomas Friant to be Robert Wallace because the camera they dropped over the wreck picked up images of the second and the third letters of the worn nameplate that looked like an R and an O. On August 1, 2004, the group anchored over the wreck again, and when the camera was sent down again, the wreck was this time identified as Thomas Friant.= =Thomas Friant today= Thomas Friant rests upright and totally intact in of water. Her hull is embedded up to the propeller hub in mud. Her smokestack is upright, and there are still fish nets, and various tools on board. There is also a heavy layer of silt around the wreck which heavily impairs visibility.

She began her position as the Professor of Medical Social Sciences at Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine in 2012.At Northwestern University she spends time doing research and teaching. On the research side of things, she conducts science experiments, oversees a research lab, writes grants and writes research articles. On the teaching side of things, she teaches undergraduate lectures and runs smaller scale seminars for graduate students. Across her career, Chen has researched many different things but has maintained a love for research. She was a post doctoral fellow at the national institute of mental health.  Research  Chen's research is centered around understanding the psychosocial and biological contributors to socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes in children. The main impact or finding that her work has had on society has been that individuals in low income status homes have had much poorer health opposed to their counterparts of higher socioeconomic status. Chen discovering this has impacted society and allowed for a greater understanding of this phenomenon and how this holds true when health is measured as prevalence of illness, the severity of these illnesses, and diseases as well. Overall her findings explore and explain why low income socioeconomic status is associated with poorer physical health not only in childhood but throughout adulthood as well. Some of the topics that Chen is researching are an Asthma study and Mentoring and Health Study. The Asthma study which is about investigating youth from low socioeconomic status families and understanding what physical and social environmental factors contribute to their terrible asthma outcomes. She is also studying this phenomenon at a cellular level to see or get an explanation as to how bad could have become worse due to external factors. Whereas the mentoring and health study which is also about youth from low socioeconomic status and other at risk youth. This is about how the youth in these areas or backgrounds can greatly benefit from mentorship. They are currently working to expand the research to physical health. They have also found that within the mentees helping others or one another has had benefits on their health. As mentioned this study like the others are still in the works.

Cricketer The son of Colonel Alexander Boddam-Whetham and his wife, Maria, Boddam-Whetham was born at Kirklington Hall in May 1843. He was educated at Eton College, though he did not represent the college XI in cricket. He did however make a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of the North against the Gentlemen of the South at Beeston in 1870. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for seven runs in the Gentlemen of the North first-innings by W. G. Grace, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by his brother, Fred Grace, for five runs. Travels During the 1870s he became a well known naturalist and traveller. He toured the western United States in the early 1870s, which included an ascent of Mount Shasta. From there he departed for Australia, and from Sydney he took a boat to Honolulu, arriving in July 1874. During his tour of the Hawaiian Islands, he attempted unsuccessfully to recover a specimen of Moho nobilis for the British Museum, a now extinct bird which was endemic to the islands. After travelling to Fiji and Samoa, he returned to Hawaii and was this time successful in recovering a pair of the birds. While travelling through Central America in 1875, Boddam-Wetham purchased two fragments from a carved wooden lintel in Flores, El Pet√©n. Now in the British Museum, they are known to be from Lintel 3 of Temple I at Tikal. British Museum Collection He returned to London in 1876. but left for a tour of Central and South America in 1877, setting out to climb Mount Roraima in British Guiana, arriving in Georgetown in January 1878. He joined a colonial government led exhibition to reach the summit of the mountain, but after a long trek through the rainforest they were unsuccessful. He continued his travels around Central America, returning to London in 1879. He published several accounts of his travels. Later life Following his travels in the 1870s, little is known of his later life, besides his marriage to Harriet Manning in November 1882 at North Shore, Sydney. He died at Folkstone in March 1918.

The influential short story depicts the life and death of a mixed-race woman and her daughter in early nineteenth century America, a slave-owning society. Child originated the trope of the \\"tragic mulatta\\", which became well-known in the anti-slavery literature of the time, was taken up also by many other writers. Years later, Harriet Jacobs's autobiography Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (edited by Lydia Maria Child) featured the same theme, but with important changes, effectively giving her an agency Child's main characters never had.  Background  Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880) was an influential writer who advocated for Native Americans, women, and enslaved people. Already an abolitionist, she and her husband joined a group of antislavery reformers under the influence of William Lloyd Garrison in the 1830s. Scholars credit Child with the invention of the \\"tragic mulatta\\", a mixed-race woman in a slave-owning society whose life ends tragically, and being the first to introduce the trope in American Literature. Many legal codes in the United States dealt with miscegenation; mixed-race marriages were forbidden, and the legal doctrine of Partus sequitur ventrem meant that children had to accept the status of the mother, meaning that an enslaved mother's children would automatically \\"belong\\" to the person enslaving the mother. The \\"tragic mulatta\\", then, is a mixed-race woman who almost passes for white and falls in love with a white man, but is legally (and sometimes psychologically) incapable of living independently from that man. The narrative almost always ends in tragedy, and often suicide.  Plot summary  Cottage The setting of the story is a cottage in Augusta, GA, before the Civil War. The two main characters, Rosalie, a \\"quadroon\\", and her husband Edward, a \\"Georgian,\\" are living together in \\"a marriage sanctioned by Heaven, though unrecognized on earth\\"Child, Lydia Maria. Liberty Bell. Anti-Slavery Fair, 1842. Rosalie, as a partly African-American woman, cannot legally marry a White man, but they live together as if they are man and wife, and she makes no legal claim on her common-law husband. They have a daughter named Xarifa, who grows up sheltered. Edward develops political ambition, and for leverage he marries a wealthy white woman, the daughter of an important politician, essentially destroying the marriage between him and Rosalie. He asks her to be his mistress but she declines, finding it morally repulsive. Rosalie and Xarifa live alone in the cottage until Rosalie died of heart break from losing Edward. Xarifa had been taken care of by teachers including George Elliot, a young man hired by her father, but Edward becomes an alcoholic due to the guilt he feels after Rosalie's death. His drinking becomes his downfall: he falls off his horse when drunk, and dies--without a will, but his wife makes no change and continues to provide for his daughter. Xarifa and her harp teacher fall in love and plan to move to France together, but Xarifa was sold before this could occur: \\"Rosalie, though she knew it not, had been the daughter of a slave; whose wealthy master, though he remained attached to her to the end of her days, had carelessly omitted to have papers of manumission recorded\\". Because Rosalie's mother had never been manumitted, her daughter and her granddaughter are still legally the property of the owner's family. Xarifa was auctioned off to the highest bidder, who is a man who tries to \\"win her favor, by flattery and presents\\", but she refuses to become his lover. Xarifa and George plan an escape but are betrayed by another enslaved person who is a double agent, and George is shot and killed in the attempt. Afterward, Xarifa's owner, having lost his patience, rapes her and she takes her own life --for the tragic mulatta, sexual violence and death are the only options.  Characters  *Rosalie, the \\"quadroon\\" of the title, is a young woman who can almost pass for white; she loves Edward knowing that she cannot marry him. She and their child, Xarifa, live in a secluded cottage in Georgia until Edward moves out to marry a White woman. *Edward, a well-to-do scion of an established Southern family, he falls in love with Rosalie and lives with her, until political ambition makes him take up with an important man's daughter. He marries her, becomes an alcoholic, and dies having fallen off his horse, drunk. *Xarifa, Rosalie's daughter, is an octoroon, living an isolated tragic life that ends in tragedy and death when her grandmother's \\"owner\\"'s family discovers the papers that claim ownership. Since slavery descends matrilineally, Xarifa legally belongs to them, and they put her on the auction block. *George was the harp teacher Edward hired to teach Xarifa. He fell in love with Xarifa and planned to run away to France with her, but the plan was betrayed and he was shot during the attempt.  Themes  = Love = The detailed description of the landscape in \\"The Quadroons\\" was seen as a metaphor for Rosalie and Edward's relationship. The passion flower, which is described as being exotic, represents Rosalie's mixed race, and the magnolia represents Edward as being a southern man. Their love, of course, could not legalized as marriage: \\"The couple have a genuine love for one another, and because of this love, Rosalie wants to sanctify their marriage to the heavens, even if it cannot be sanctified under law\\". =Death: tragic, suicidal, homicidal= Every one of the main characters dies: Rosalie soon dies after she sees Edward and his new wife, Charlotte, a year after their marriage. A year before, Rosalie had refused to be Edward's mistress. Child makes it clear to point out that Rosalie felt inadequate with herself, referring to her blackness or her otherness, that was seen as weak and submissive. This is the reason she ultimately succumbed to her death. Edward takes her death very hard and blames himself, turning to drink--which kills him. George Elliot, their daughter's music teacher, is killed in the attempt to escape, and Xarifa commits suicide after being raped by the man who bought her. Child makes sure that readers know how slavery and this society has caused the destruction of the entire family, and that the tragic mulatta, who was already the product of sexual violence, in turn becomes a victim of sexual violence, with death either as an attendant outcome or as an alternative.  Influence  Child's works tackled economical, social, racial and sexual issues that provoked movements inside and outside the literary world. A work that was influenced by \\"The Quadroons\\" is Clotel by William Wells Brown. Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, although an autobiography and not a work of fiction, has been interpreted as \\"a retelling\\" of \\"The Quadroons\\".  Publication history  The story was first published in 1842 in the Liberty Bell, an annual abolitionist gift book published from 1839 to 1858. It was republished in 1846 in a collection called Fact and Fiction: A Collection of Stories.  Reception  \\"The Quadroons\\" is a work that is seldom discussed without being pulled into Child's other short works at the time. Most critics at the time of its publishing did not receive her works very well; many would say that Child would add details to her stories to exaggerate issues. In a letter sent to Maria Weston Chapman, Lydia Maria Child said she wanted to get the attention of those that are younger and interested in romantic stories rather than those critiquing her work. This has led to people arguing if \\"The Quadroons\\" would be considered a success or failure? She could continue to influence other writers with her perspective on slavery, feminism, and even transcendentalism.

It is unclear whether it is of John Alcock (1740-1791), as stated by the Scottish National Gallery, or of his father, John Alcock (1715‚Äì1806), as stated by the National Portrait Gallery. John Alcock ( 28 January 1740 ‚Äì 30 March 1791) was an English organist, who composed several songs between 1770 and 1780. Biography John Alcock was born around 1740, to Margaret Alcock, n√©e Beaumont (1711‚Äì1792), and John Alcock (1715‚Äì1806), himself a famous composer and organist. He was born in Plymouth, Devon and baptised there on 28 January 1740. He learned to play the organ through his father's position as organist and master of the choristers at Lichfield Cathedral, working under him as a chorister. By the age of twelve he was deputising for his father on occasion, his father apparently assured Alcock was already sufficiently skilled. Alcock's first professional position was as organist and master of the song school at Newark- on-Trent parish church, 1758 to 1768. In 1766, he accompanied his father to Oxford University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Music in 1773, while his father proceeded to a Doctor of Music. In 1773, he became the organist of St Matthew's Church, Walsall, a position he maintained until his death. Between 1770 and 1780, Alcock composed and published several songs, cantatas, and instrumental works, for both the harpsichord and strings. He collaborated in his father's publication, Six New Anthems (1795). Alcock composed alone Parochial Harmony, or a Collection of Divine-Music in Score (1777), published by Francis Roome (fl. 1777-1794), and \\"Expressly Composed for the use of Country Choirs\\", stating his position as \\"Batchelor in Music and Organist of Walsall\\" on the title page. Those of Alcock's published works, noted by the Dictionary of Composers for the Church in Great Britain and Ireland, are 'Arise, O Lord, and Lift Up' and 'The Lord is King'. Alcock died on 30 March 1791, aged 51, at his house, near Walsall, predeceasing both his parents. His obituary was published in The Gentleman's Magazine which declared that upon his death \\"he was the oldest Bachelor of Music in Great Britain or Ireland\\". The obituary memorialized his compositions flatteringly as \\"much esteemed by all competent judges\\" and praised his \\"superior knowledge in musick, as well as his excellent performances on the organ, which always were in the true church style\\".

It carries the dual carriageway Parkes Way under a hill. The tunnel also comprises two upper levels, which have been used as an archival repository and car park by the Australian National University (ANU). History The Acton Tunnel was first proposed in the 1960s as part of long- term planning for Canberra's road network. It was to form part of an extension of Parkes Way to Queanbeyan via Canberra Airport. The tunnel would also form part of the construction of what became the Tuggeranong Parkway, which provided a link between the Woden Valley and Civic. The entrance to the upper levels of the tunnel in 2012 The construction of the Acton Tunnel formed part of a major upgrade to Canberra's roads. This comprised the construction of a new highway segment which connected the Tuggeranong Parkway to Parkes Way and Caswell Drive. The upgrade also comprised the Glenloch Interchange and Lakeside Interchange. Construction of this new network began in 1976. The Acton Tunnel and other elements of the new roads opened on 17 October 1979. The tunnel cost $A7 million to build. The tunnel comprises three levels. The lowest level carries Parkes Way, and is about high. The two upper levels were originally designed to be used as a car park for 300 vehicles by the ANU. The University contributed $A200,000 to the tunnel's construction for this purpose. By the time the tunnel opened, the ANU had decided to use this space to store elements of its archives of business and labour in Australia. As these records had a higher structural load than cars, only half of the facility could be used for this purpose. The archives, which was named the Noel Butlin Archives Centre, opened in 1981. As of 2019, part of the facility was being used as a parking station. In September 1980 a section of the roof of the tunnel at the eastern end of the west-bound lanes was found to be sagging and required immediate repairs. A member of the ACT Legislative Assembly attributed this issue to faults with the tunnel's design and inadequate supervision of its construction by the National Capital Development Commission. A truck carrying an excavator collided with the roof of the Acton Tunnel on 20 October 2015. This accident damaged around of the tunnel's roof. Repairs to the tunnel were completed on 22 October 2016, with the cost of the work having been covered by insurance. The truck driver was fined $3,000 for exceeding the tunnel's height limit, and was reported to have retained his job.

It is the highest paved road in elevation in Taiwan. History Originally, a trail was built by the Atayal people at the same location. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, the Governor-General of Taiwan, Sakuma Samata, ordered the construction of a road through the same trail as part of the Five years plan to governing aborigines to better transport supplies in the Truku War. The pass was named \\"Sakuma Pass\\" in the general's honor. After the change of governance to the Kuomingtang, the Nationalist government continued to work on the highway. Chiang Kai-shek visited the highway, renaming the site as \\"Wuling\\". Since the Central Cross-Island Highway is closed due to typhoon damage, Wuling became the only route in the area transversing the Central Mountain Range. Recreation Wuling is a popular destination for road cycling. The three possible routes include: * From the east (85 km, 3,215 m elevation): Beginning in Taroko Gorge, the route follows Highway 8 to Dayuling, where the route turns south to the peak. Regarded as the toughest route of the three. * From the west (53 km, 2,800 m elevation): Beginning in Puli, Nantou, the route follows Highway 14 and 14A through Qingjing Farm. * From the north (62 km, 2,300 m elevation): Beginning in Wuling Farm, the route follows Highway 7A to Lishan, where it takes Provincial Highway 8 to Dayuling, then 14A to the peak. Many races are held to ride to Wuling, most notably the Taiwan KOM Challenge, a non-UCI sanctioned race beginning in Qixingtan Beach and takes the eastern route. The 107 km race is regarded as an intense climb within the cycling community, with Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali commenting: \\"I've never ridden such a long and hard climb before in my entire life.\\" Wuling is also a popular stargazing and bird-watching location. Common birds include the Taiwan rosefinch, white-whiskered laughingthrush, and collared bush robin.

One person died due to a heart attack and 43 people were injured. The earthquake was felt in Istanbul, Tekirdaƒü, Kƒ±rklareli, Kocaeli and Sakarya.  Background  North Anatolian Fault system is a strike-slip fault system located in the northern side of Anatolian plate, which lies between relatively stationary Eurasian plate in the north and the Arabian plate in the south. Approximately 1500 km in length, the North Anatolian fault system passes about 20 kilometers south of Istanbul. Strong earthquakes occur at certain intervals along the fault. The last large earthquakes in the fault system happened in 1999. In 17 August the earthquake in ƒ∞zmit (7.4 Mw) killed 17.480 people. In 12 November, another earthquake in the nearby city of D√ºzce (7.2 Mw) killed 845 and injured 4.948. Many seismologist agree that there is a very high chance for a 7 or higher magnitude earthquake before 2030; which will be caused by the breaking of the North Anatolian fault line under Marmara Sea, just south of Istanbul.  Earthquake  Three days before the main earthquake, on 23 September, there was a 4.6-degree shock in the south-west of Istanbul. Two hours before the earthquake, at 12:00 noon, a 2.9 earthquake took place in Silivri. The earthquake happened at 13:59 local time at the western edge of the Kumburgaz section of North Anatolian Fault under the Sea of Marmara, at a depth of 6.99 km as a strike-slip movement. Different sources states the magnitude as 5.7 Mw and 5.8 ML. Over 300 aftershocks were reported after the main earthquake.  Damage  Schools and hospitals were evacuated after the earthquake. Governor of Istanbul Ali Yerlikaya announced the schools were closed for the day. AFAD suggested not to enter to the damaged buildings. A 4.1 magnitude aftershock was reported 25 minutes after the main shock. The first announcement by the President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan stated 8 injured. Later announcements stated a total of 43 injured mostly from panic, and one person with known heart illness dead due to a heart attack. 188 aftershocks with maximum magnitude of 4.1 were recorded after the earthquake. A total of 473 buildings were reported as damaged to AFAD. A minaret of Avcƒ±lar Hacƒ± Ahmet T√ºkenmez mosque collapsed. Three protected old buildings were damaged in Balat, and later demolished by the municipality later in the day. Take-offs and landings to Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport were temporarily halted, but flight operations resumed after the runway was checked for potential damage and deemed safe. AFAD reported damage to walls of the city near ƒ∞stanbul Biruni University, cracks in some buildings in some neighborhoods, damage in two buildings in Sultangazi and Ey√ºp, and evacuation of a building in ≈ûirinevler. Mobile phone coverage of T√ºrk Telekom, Turkcell, and Vodafone were interrupted nationwide for some time after the earthquake, while mobile internet services and landlines were not affected.

After secondary school in Brussels, he studied at the University of Ghent without taking a degree. From 1854 to 1857 he served on Ghent city council as alderman of public works, extending the city library. In 1861 he succeeded his father-in-law as mayor of Nazareth, Belgium, retaining that position until his death. In the 1861 parliamentary elections he was elected from the arrondissement of Ghent. He was not re-elected in the 1864 elections, but he again represented the same constituency from 1870 to 1878. His maiden speech in the Chamber of Representatives, on 11 June 1861, was against the Anglo-Belgian Treaty of Commerce and Navigation then being negotiated, which he saw as a threat to Ghent's textile industry. He took an active part in parliamentary debates on the budgets for home affairs and public works, demonstrating concern for the bridges, roads and telegraph lines in his own constituency, as well as for the enlargement of the Ghent‚ÄìTerneuzen Canal, but also for the better accommodation of the National Archives of Belgium and the State Archives in Ghent, better wages and working conditions for librarians and archivists in state employ, and an increase in the subsidy to Ghent conservatory. He ensured that the Geeraard de Duivelsteen was acquired by the state to house the State Archives in Ghent. Before and during his political career, he was active in cultural and literary societies, and published on antiquarian themes. In 1850 he became one of the directors of the Messager des sciences historiques, to which he was a frequent contributor throughout his life. He published several books, two articles in the Annales de l'Acad√©mie d'Arch√©ologie d'Anvers, and sixteen items in the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, ten on members of the Borluut family.

Obscurantism The criticism most often heard from the critics of Marx, such as Friedrich von Hayek, Karl Popper, Francis Wheen and Ian Steedman is that, even if Marx himself meant well, Marx's value-form idea is simply an esoteric obscurantism, \\"dialectical hocus pocus\\", \\"sophistry\\", or \\"mumbo jumbo\\". Francis Wheen refers to \\"a shaggy-dog story, a picaresque journey through the realms of higher nonsense.\\"Francis Wheen, Marx's Das Kapital: a biography. Grove Press, 2008, p. 42.

Mark Blaug stated that \\"the reader will miss little by skipping the pedantic third section of Chapter I\\".Mark Blaug, Economic Theory in Retrospect. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 256. This type of criticism was already being made while Marx was still alive, as Marx himself reports in a postface to the second German edition of Capital, Volume I in 1873.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition, 1976, pp. 99‚Äì100. Often, Marxists have replied to this type of criticism by restating Marx's arguments in clearer language, or by showing that Marx's theory of economic value at the very least fares no worse than the subjective theory of value (the theory of the util as the measuring unit of utility).Simon Clarke, Marx, Marginalism and Modern Sociology. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1991. Even so, when he published his very clear restatement Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence,Gerald Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence. Princeton University Press, 1978, reprint 2001. the Marxist philosopher Gerald Cohen explicitly dissociated himself from Marx's value theory. Cohen argued that it is possible to have a historical materialism without a labour theory of value, because the one does not logically entail the other as well.Gerald Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence.

Earlier on, in 1880, Engels had written (at the end of Part 2 of his pamphlet Socialism: Utopian and Scientific) that \\"two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value, we owe to Marx. With these discoveries, Socialism became a science.\\"Friedrich Engels, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (an excerpt from Herr Eugen D√ºhring's Revolution in Science, also known as the Anti-D√ºhring). Substance of value Marx's argument is that the exchangeability of commodities with recognition of their value is enabled by the common factor that all of them are products of social labour (co-operative human labour producing things for others).Karl Marx & Frederick Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 532. Critics suggest that Marx's observations fail to provide any logically decisive proof that human labour-time (work effort) is the substance of the economic value of all products. =Marx's own response= In a famous letter from Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann dated 11 July 1868, Marx became extremely indignant and derisive about this objection, stating among other things that: =Modern debate= In 1989, Simon Clarke captured the essence of the modern value-form debate within Western Marxism, as a hyper-abstract scholastic debate about the form and contentAntonio Callari states that \\"We can see the entire architecture of Capital (four volumes) through the lenses of the content-and-form relationship\\" - Callari, \\"Dialectics and overdetermination\\".

Research in Political Economy, Vol. 22, 2005, pp. 167-198, at pp. 172-173. is that \\"If exchange effects the reduction of concrete to abstract labor, then the magnitude of value is determined not by the expenditure of labor in production, but only in exchange.\\" Although Rubin did refer to \\"a quantitative determination of abstract labor before the act of exchange and independent of it\\",Isaac I. Rubin, Essays on Marx's theory of value, p. 155-157. by his own definition he lacked any method for determining the magnitude of abstract labour prior to exchange, or for showing how it might influence product-values. Paradoxically, it seemed that if value itself can only be determined with reference to exchange ratios in markets, then value cannot be the sole determinant of prices (a conclusion already reached by Joan Robinson in 1950.Joan Robinson, \\"Karl Marx and the close of his system\\", The Economic Journal, Vol. 60, No. 238, June 1950, pp. 358-363, at p. 362.) *The Rubin-followers generally abandoned any attempt to provide quantitative measures of value, being content with qualitative and theoretical discussion about social forms, fetishism, Hegelian dialectics, the value abstraction, etc.See e.g. Ira Gerstein, \\"Production, circulation and value\\". Economy and society, Vol. 5, No. 3, 1976, pp. 243-291. *The value-form theorists claimed, that value can only be expressed by money, and that value in a labour economy cannot exist prior to exchange (trade). In that case, the purpose of value theory is about (re-)interpreting the social meaning of market phenomena in a Hegelian philosophical way,Geert Reuten, \\"Value as social form\\". In: Michael S. Williams (ed.), Value, social form and the state. Houndmills: Macmillan Press, 1988; Christopher J. Arthur, The New Dialectic and Marx's Capital. Leiden: Brill, 2004. and not with measuring the magnitudes of value. *Some Marxists argued, that Marx's theory of value is only intended to explain the macro- level, and is not applicable to the micro-level of the economy.Riccardo Bellofiore, \\"A monetary labor theory of value\\".

A Macro-Monetary Interpretation of Marx's logic in Capital and the end of the transformation problem. Leiden: Brill, 2015. *Some Marxists argued, that since money simply represents abstract labour or a claim on labour, money-quantities can be converted into labour equivalents according to some formula (by relating labour-inputs and material inputs to corresponding output-prices), enabling a comparison of product-values and product-prices, and a demonstration of how value is redistributed by the market.Simon Mohun, \\"A re(in)statement of the labour theory of value.\\" Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 18 no. 4, pp. 391-412, August 1994. Different techniques have been proposed for the conversion.Paul Cockshott, Allin Cottrell & Alejandro Valle Baeza, \\"The empirics of the labour theory of value: reply to Nitzan and Bichler\\". Investigaci√≥n Econ√≥mica, vol. LXXIII, no. 287, January‚ÄìMarch 2014, pp. 115-134. *There are also Marx-scholars, such as Guglielmo Carchedi, who try to combine a dialectical and econometric approach to understanding the forms of value.Guglielmo Carchedi, Frontiers of political economy. London: Verso, 1991; Carchedi, \\"The Fallacies of 'New Dialectics' and Value-Form Theory\\". Historical Materialism, 17, 2009, pp. 145‚Äì169; Carchedi, Behind the crisis: Marx's dialectics of value and knowledge. Leiden: Brill, 2011. Contemporary Marxian academic research in \\"value theory\\" has become a broad area. In 2018, Riccardo Bellofiore, an Italian Marxist economist, concluded from his own perspective that Marx's value theory has \\"multiple meanings\\".Riccardo Bellofiore, \\"The Multiple Meanings of Marx's Value Theory\\". Monthly Review, Volume 69, Issue 11, April 2018. This can cause extra confusion, because what one Marxist means by \\"value theory\\" may not be what another Marxist means by value theory. Nevertheless, Ben Fine and Alfredo Saad-Filho, commenting on contemporary Marxist economics, say that: The old Marxist theory was held together by the philosophy of dialectical materialism,Leon Trotsky, \\"Dialectical Materialism and Science (17 September 1925)\\". New International, Vol.6, No.1, February 1940, pp. 24-31 ; J. V. Stalin, Dialectical and Historical Materialism (September 1938); Mao Tse-tung, On contradiction (1937), in: Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. I (Peking: Foreign Languages Press). . but in the new academic Marxism of the West, \\"value theory\\" is said to be the unifying factor. The unresolved issue then is, whether value theory really can be the unifying factor, if there are a large number of different and competing Marxist interpretations of value, with many different flavors, tastes and preferences, and pitched at many different levels of academic abstraction. Already in 1951, when he had tried to create firm conceptual foundations for value studies,Nicholas Rescher, Introduction to value theory. Englewood Clifs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1969, pp. 1-2. the anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn concluded that the task was exceedingly difficult, if not an impossible venture: Sub-theme A \\"sub-theme\\" of this academic controversy concerns the issue of whether concepts like abstract labour or the value-form are \\"historically specific\\" categories or \\"transhistorical\\" categories. For example, Massimo de Angelis and Christopher J. Arthur claim that abstract labour is a \\"specifically capitalist category\\", which has no transhistorical validity in different modes of production.Werner Bonefeld, Critical theory and the critique of political economy. New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2014, p. 123f. According to Karl Korsch's \\"principle of historical specification\\", \\"Marx comprehends all things social in terms of a definite historical epoch.\\"Karl Korsch, Karl Marx. Leiden: Brill, 2016, p. 12. Marx himself said that the abstract category of labour (\\"labour in general\\", or \\"labour as such\\", i.e. labour considered with indifference to its particular forms) expresses \\"an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society\\" (or \\"an ancient relation existing in all forms of society\\"); but, he went on to say, only in modern bourgeois society (as exemplified e.g. by the United States) is this category fully realized in practice.Karl Marx, Grundrisse, Penguin 1973, pp. 103-105. Cf. MECW 28, p. 41. Because only there does a system of price-equations exist within a universal market, which can really and practically reduce the valuation of all forms and quantities of labour uniformly to sums of money, so that any kind of labour becomes an interchangeable, tradeable good or \\"input\\" with a known price tag - and is also practically treated as such.See Bureau of Labor Statistics data on occupations, wages and employment . In other words, abstract labour for Marx was not a fixed, immutable and static category, which fell out of the air one day circa 1750, but an historically evolving category.Nicholas J. Theocarakis, \\"Metamorphoses: the concept of labour in the history of political economy\\". The Economic and Labour Relations Review, Vol. 20 No. 2, 2010, pp. 7‚Äì38. If each social category was uniquely and exclusively applicable to only one specific stage of history, it would be impossible to understand the transition from one historical stage to another stage, or to understand human progress through different epochs. Marx does not say that trans-historical categories are not valid, but instead that historical categories which are applicable only to a particular epoch in human history should not be generalized or eternalized, \\"as if\\" they are everlasting trans-historical realities.Derek Sayer, Marx's method. Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester Press, 1979. Phenomena ought to be understood in their appropriate specificity, for the sake of valid generalizations. If current transitory realities are treated as eternal in the imagination, it appears as if they are immutable and cannot change anymore (a conservative ideology), but that overlooks the very things which are changing. This leads to the confusion of analytical constants and variables, with constants and variables in the real world (ultimately, almost nothing in the universe stays constant, although for humans there are constants \\"for all intents and purposes\\"). Long before commercial trade emerged, when subsistence hunters, gatherers and farmers had to judge how much time and work it would take to obtain food, they were already compelled to think abstractly and value the allocation of their labour time ‚Äì giving rise to the first numerical expressions.\\"Our first conceptions of number and form date back to times as far removed as the Old Stone Age, the Paleolithicum\\" - Dirk J. Struik, A concise history of mathematics, Vol. 1. New York: Dover Publications, 1948, p. 1 (5th edition 2012). They had count and compare to survive, because their time and resources were limited, though obviously their valuations differed from the capitalist methods and concepts in use today. Even if they were not aware of the necessary proportions for the allocation of labour time by the clan, tribe, community etc., they were certainly confronted with its effects. Namely, if they did it wrong, their own people died. So they learnt soon enough from experience, to avoid all the worst mis-allocations of labour - they wanted to stay alive, and prosper. Modern research provides evidence that some animals, too, exhibit at least a rudimentary ability for numerical abstraction and a sense of numerical proportion, suggesting it is necessary for survival.Ewen Callaway, \\"Animals that count: how numeracy evolved.\\" New Scientist, 17 June 2009. Emily Sohn, \\"Number of the beasts\\". New Scientist, Vol. 181, Issue 2431, 24 January 2004, p. 38. Sarah T. Boysen & E. John Capaldi (eds.), The development of numerical competence ‚Äì animal and human models. Hillsdale N.J. & London: Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, 1993. In this sense, Marx comments that: \\"Value\\", Marx said, \\"does not have its description branded on its forehead: it rather transforms every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, men try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of their own social product...\\"Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 167. Thus, for example, archaeologist Marc Van de Mieroop comments about the Sumerian economy of ancient Mesopotamia as follows: On the basis of their input/output and labour accounting, the Sumerian accountants, particularly from the Ur III period, were evidently able to estimate, in quantitatively accurate terms, how much labour it would take to produce a certain quantity of output, and therefore how many workers were needed for a given interval of time. According to archaeologist Robert K. Englund, \\"The concept of value equivalency was a secure element in Babylonian accounting by at least the time of the sales contracts of the ED IIIa (Fara) period, c. 2600 BC\\"; the formation and use of grain product equivalencies was \\"an important step in the direction of general value equivalencies, best attested for in the Ur III period for silver, but then still generally applicable for other commodities such as grain or fish, including finally also labor time.\\"Robert K. Englund, \\"Proto-cuneiform account-books and journals\\", in: Michael Hudson and Cornelia Wunsch , Creating Economic Order: Recordkeeping, standardization and the development of accounting in the ancient Near East. Bethesda: CDL, 2004, pp. 23-46, at p. 38. Labour historian Jan Lucassen states that the first wages were paid to soldiers employed by early states 5,000 years ago, the first labour markets emerged between 2,000 and 1,000 BC (when temple officials began to subcontract labour), and waged workers were being paid with coins since about 600 BC. Already 2,000 years ago, workers could be paid for a specific part of a working day with coin.Jan Lucassen, \\"Wage Labour\\", in: Karin Hofmeester & Marcel van der Linden (eds.), Handbook of the global history of work. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2018, at pp. 1274, 1289-1291. The significance of such historical and archaeological data about the evolution of abstract labour and value is denied by many Marxists, because, according to their idea of \\"historical specificity\\", capitalism is capitalism only if there is capitalism, and value is exclusively a creation of capitalism. Rubin Since 1972, when Isaac Rubin's bookIsaac I. Rubin, Essay's on Marx's theory of value. Detroit: Black & Red, 1972. was republished in translation, the Western Marxist value-form controversy has continued for nearly half a century.Axel Kicillof and Guido Starosta, \\"On Materiality and Social Form: A Political Critique of Rubin's Value-Form Theory\\". Historical Materialism, 15, 2007, pp. 9‚Äì43, at p. 9-10. Different schools of thought have emerged, without however reaching a definite solution amenable to all. However, in reality, the intellectual controversy has much deeper historical roots.Hans-Georg Backhaus, \\"On the dialectics of the value-form\\". Thesis Eleven, Vol. 1 No. 1, February 1980, pp. 99-120. As Rubin himself stated, \\"All post-Ricardian political economy revolved around the question of the relation between production price and labor-value. Answering this question was an historic task for economic thought. In Marx's view, the particular merit of his theory of value was that it gave a solution to this problem.\\"Rubin, Essays, p. 250, translation corrected. Rubin's claim was that, in Marx's view, the labor theory of value and the theory of production prices represent \\"two logical stages or degrees of abstraction from the same economic phenomena\\" instead of being two models that contradict each other.Rubin, Essays, p. 251. See also Ronald L. Meek, \\"A plain person's guide to the transformation problem\\". In: Ronald L. Meek, Smith, Marx and after. Ten essays in the development of economic thought. London: Chapman & Hall, 1997, pp. 95-119. The next problem however was, that Rubin's vague \\"levels of abstraction\\" interpretation never clarified what exactly this means in verifiable and quantifiable scientific terms. And therefore, critics argue, Rubin's alleged \\"solution\\" is no scientifically acceptable solution at all, of the problem of the relationship between production prices and labour-values‚Äîit is just a \\"definition\\".Perhaps Rubin's manuscript on the transformation problem was lost or destroyed. See: Ivan Boldyrev & Martin Kragh, \\"The Fate of Social Sciences in Soviet Russia: The Case of Isaak Il'Ich Rubin\\".

The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought. Vol. 20, Issue 3, May 2013, pp. 536-542. Final concept In Marx's finished theory of value, the \\"value\\" of a commodity turns out to be the social valuation of its average, current replacement cost in labour time (a synchronic economic reproduction cost)\\"...the value of a commodity is determined not by the quantity of labour actually objectified in it, but by the quantity of living labour necessary to produce it.\\" ‚Äî Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 676-677. \\"...the value of commodities is determined not by the labour-time originally taken by their production, but rather by the labour-time that their reproduction takes, and this steadily decreases as the social productivity of labour develops.\\" ‚Äî Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 522. but this particular labour requirement turns out to be quite a different quantity than either \\"labour embodied\\" in production (the actual worktime performed to make the commodity) or \\"labour commanded\\" in exchange (how much worktime can be purchased, on average, for the money-price of the commodity).E. Wolfstetter, \\"Surplus Labour, Synchronised Labour Costs and Marx's Labour Theory of Value\\". The Economic Journal, Vol. 83, No. 331, September 1973, pp. 787-809; Fransisco Paulo Cipolla, \\"The Concept of Market Value: A Critical Note on Itoh's Theory\\".

Phd dissertation, Open University, 2015; Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: competition, conflict, crises. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016. That is a logical consequence of Marx's theory of market value and production prices. It remains true, however, that if we want to estimate or measure this average quantity empirically, as a statistic, this requires reference to money prices and price aggregates; we cannot measure average product-value, without reference to the forms in which value is expressed - in order to establish the connection between product units, prices and labour.Edward B. Chilcote, \\"Calculating Labour Values Empirically\\". In: Alan Freeman et al., The New Value Controversy and the Foundations of Economics. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2004, pp. 199-217. In this respect, the input-output economics of Wassily Leontief and Luigi Pasinetti's econometric concept of vertical integration have proved to be useful.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: competition, conflict, crises. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016. =Japanese Unoist school= Because of the controversy over the substance of value, the famous Japanese Marxist scholar Kozo Uno argued in his classic Principles of Political Economy that Marx's original argument had to be revised.Kozo Uno, Principles of Political Economy. Theory of a Purely Capitalist Society. Translated from the Japanese by Thomas T. Sekine. Brighton, Atlantic Highlands/New Jersey: Harvester Press, 1980. See also Samezo Kuruma, Theory of the Value-Form & Theory of the Exchange Process. Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1957 In Uno's opinion, Marx had narrated the story the wrong way round, causing confusion. The arguments therefore had to be re- ordered. In the revised version, the theory of the value-form is integrated in the theory of commodity circulation, and does not refer to the substance (content) of value at all.Thomas T. Sekine, An outline of the dialectic of capital, Vol. 1. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Macmillan Press Ltd, 1997, Part 1 section 1, p. 25ff. The form and substance of value are radically separated. The substance of value as labour then becomes apparent (and is theoretically demonstrated) only in the analysis of the production of commodities \\"by means of commodities\\" (including the commodity labour-power). Some Western Marxists do not find this Unoist approach very satisfactory however, among other things because (1) a \\"form\\" is a form \\"of\\" something, the form that a content takes, hence form and content are not really separable, and (2) Marx claims that the formation of product values is an outcome of both the \\"economy of labour-time\\" and \\"the economy of trade\\" working in tandem.See Simon Clarke, \\"The Basic Theory of Capitalism: A Critical Review of Itoh and the Uno School\\", in: Capital & Class, Vol. 13, No. 1, March 1989, pp. 133‚Äì149; Jim Kincaid, \\"A Critique of Value-Form Marxism\\".

Historical Materialism, Vol. 22 No. 1, May 2014, pp. 3-33. When a product is produced, it has a value; we can say that it requires a certain amount of labour to produce it, supply it or replace it. How much that value is, however, becomes apparent only when it is traded regularly and compared with other products. =Western value-form school= From the 1970s, the so-called \\"value-form theorists\\" (\\"value-form school\\")Jan Hoff, Marx Worldwide; on the development of the international discourse on Marx since 1965.

In this way, the quantitative attack by neo-Ricardians against Marx's value theory is considered to become irrelevant. The value-form school has become very popular especially among Western Marxists who are not economists.A good example is: Christopher J. Arthur, The New Dialectic and Marx's 'Capital'. Leiden: Brill, 2004. Supporters of the \\"value-form school\\", especially in Germany and Britain, often regard Marx's theory of the form of value as proof of a radical break from all conventional economics.Riccardo Bellofiore and Tommaso Redolfi Riva, \\"The Neue Marx-Lekt√ºre: putting the critique of political economy back into the critique of society.\\" In: Radical Philosophy No. 189, January‚ÄìFebruary 2015. This implies there is little point in engaging with conventional economics, because conventional economics makes quite incompatible theoretical assumptions. Critics of the value-form school often see this intellectual tradition as an \\"evasive tactic\\", which avoids difficult quantitative problems concerning the relationship between economic value and money-prices which still need to be solved.Cf.

Chicago: MCM Publishing, 2014. =Sohn-Rethel= In a text which had a big influence on the scholarly discussion,Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and manual labour: a critique of epistemology. London: Macmillan, 1978; Anselm Jappe, \\"Sohn-Rethel and the Origin of 'Real Abstraction': A Critique of Production or a Critique of Circulation?\\". Historical materialism, Vol. 21 No. 1, 2013, pp. 3-14. Alfred Sohn-Rethel examined the meaning and implications of Marx's concept of the forms of value in some detail. He claimed that \\"The formal analysis of the commodity holds the key not only to the critique of political economy, but also to the historical explanation of the conceptual mode of thinking and of the division of intellectual and manual labour, which came into existence with it.\\"Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and manual labour, p. 33. Marx had noted that by equating their products in exchange as values, people also equate the quantities of human labour ordinarily required to produce them, regardless of whether they are aware of it or not (very likely they would not‚Äîand could not‚Äîknow accurately how much labour the products represent, or even where the products originated). This is a \\"functional effect\\" of the trading relationship.Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and manual labour, p. 49. Sohn- Rethel calls this a \\"real abstraction\\"‚Äîit is an abstraction performed not primarily by thinking, but unintentionally by doing and participating in a system of symbolic conventions.Similarly, Marx claims that \\"Those who consider the autonomization [Verselbst√§ndigung] of value as a mere abstraction, forget that the movement of industrial capital is this abstraction in action. Here value passes through different forms, different movements in which it is both preserved and increases, is valorized.\\" ‚Äî Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II, Penguin 1978, p. 185. Subsequently, the \\"real abstraction\\" is however transformed into a \\"conceptual abstraction\\" which, he argues, has very large implications for the further evolution of human thought. It then seems that abstract labour is purely an effect of economic exchange. Sohn-Rethel pondered the question of what holds society together, when all production is carried on by private agents acting independently of each other. He concludes, like Friedrich Hayek, that society can in that case cohere only through \\"buying and selling\\". It then seems to follow, that \\"The nexus of society is established by the network of exchange and nothing else.\\"Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and manual labour, p. 29, emphasis added. A similar idea is proposed by Richard Sennett in his book Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Cooperation. London: Penguin, 2013, p. 72: \\"'Exchange simply names the experience of give and take among all animals.\\" This idea however departs from Marx's theory since, for Marx, it is not the relations of exchange (the market transactions) that hold society together, but the cooperative relations of production (governed by property rights), that form the economic structure of society.\\"In the social production of their existence, people inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.\\" ‚Äî Karl Marx, 1859 Preface to A contribution to the critique of political economy. Part of this labour cooperation is certainly voluntary and freely chosen, but part of it is compelled by necessity since people cannot survive or prosper without it. What disappears from view in Sohn-Rethel's interpretation is that, in the production and reproduction of human life, people also need to cooperate in many ways which have nothing to do with trade (being a \\"market transactor\\" is just one role among others). Sohn-Rethel's radical idea is moreover not even very plausible, since (1) society does not simply collapse everywhere, if, in a crisis, the trading process breaks down to some large degree,Max Chafkin, \\"A constant feeling of crisis\\". Inc. Magazine, 14 July 2017. and (2) at any time, the majority of the stock of objects of value in society (stored, or in use) is not being traded at all. So in reality, the \\"social nexus\\" or \\"social synthesis\\" involves at any time far more relations of cooperation than trade alone. =Moishe Postone= Borrowing ideas from (among others) Patrick Murray and Derek Sayer,Moishe Postone, Time, labor, and social domination: A reinterpretation of Marx's critical theory.

Moishe Postone based his value-form interpretation on an excerpt of a footnote from Marx's Capital, Volume I, which was incorrectly translated by Ben Fowkes: Postone alleged that in \\"traditional Marxism\\" (such as \\"Sweezy, Mandel, and others\\"),Postone, Time etc., p. 45. the meaning of \\"value\\" and \\"labour\\" was wrongly interpreted:For a post-Marxist commentary, see Marcel van der Linden, \\"The historical limit of workers' protest: Moishe Postone, Krisis and the 'commodity logic'\\". In: International Review of Labour History, Vol. 42, Issue 3, December 1997, pp. 447-458. *Because \\"value\\" was allegedly equated with the transhistorical category of physical or material wealth, it became impossible to \\"analyze the historical specificity of the form of labor that constitutes value\\" within capitalism. Yet, such an analysis is required to understand \\"how the value- form structures the sphere of production as well as that of distribution.\\" *For Marx, labor in capitalism \\"must exist in the form of value\\" and \\"necessarily appears in a form that both expresses and veils it.\\"Postone, Time etc., p. 63.

The Tendencies of Accumulation and the Determination of Economic Policy in Capitalist Society. London, 1989. is that although Marx's alleged labour theory of value is theoretically wrong as stated, his theory can be modified such that, rather than value being created by co-operative human labour, value and abstract labour can be regarded as effects (\\"social forms\\") created by the exchange-process itself.Riccardo Bellofiore, \\"A Monetary Labor Theory of Value\\".

There are no pre- market value entities...\\" - Geert Reuten, \\"Value as social form\\". In: Michael S. Williams (ed.), Value, social form and the state. Houndmills: Macmillan Press, 1988, p. 53. from which it seems to follow, that if money does not exist, value does not exist either. This interpretation is often called the monetary theory of value.Michael Heinrich, \\"Monet√§re Werttheorie. Geld und Krise bei Marx\\". Prokla (Berlin), Vol. 30, No. 2, June 2001, pp. 151-176; Kolja Lindner, \\"The German Debate on the Monetary Theory of Value. Considerations on Jan Hoff's Kritik der klassischen politischen √ñkonomie\\", Science & Society Vol. 72, No. 4, 2008, pp. 402‚Äì414. Jean Cartelier, \\"Marx's Theory of Value, Exchange and Surplus Value: A Suggested Reformulation\\". Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 15, no. 3, September 1991, pp. 257‚Äì269. Thus, Michael Heinrich claims that: Marx himself flatly denied this \\"monetary\\" interpretation of value when he said explicitly in chapter 2 of Capital, Volume I that \\"The act of exchange gives to the commodity converted into money, not its value, but its specific value-form\\".Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition, 1976, pp. 184‚Äì185. In other words, for Marx, the fact that commodities have the property of value in the first instance, has nothing to do with exchange as such. It has to do with the reality that the commodities are the products of quantities of social labour (they have an average replacement cost in labour time; some people have to do the work, so that others can acquire the products). Yet, only through regular exchange does it become observably manifest how much value the commodities represent. It was this subtlety, that stumped the Western Marxist scholastics, i.e., that in the real world, production and circulation are interactive. There do not exist any \\"substantialist\\" scholars in economics who think that \\"value\\" is literally a kind of \\"stuff\\" inserted into every commodity when it is produced. Modern money is fiduciary currency, or money of account, that actually has very little intrinsic value.Printing a US$1 banknote costs around 5 cents. Federal Reserve Board FAQ page, How much does it cost to produce currency and coin?. The \\"value of money\\" is that one can acquire real product-value with it. It is true though that the ability to express value in currency units, is ordinarily presupposed and crucial for the growth of trade on a very large scale. And, to measure the labour-value of outputs, reference to prices is necessary. The act of exchange (whether a cash deal, barter, or a credit arrangement) reveals the form in which the value of commodities is expressed, accurately or inaccurately; the trading process provides various possibilities for expressing the value of products (using different price assumptions, valuations, currencies etc.). Marx's whole theory of economics is based on the idea that it is not \\"the market\\" which creates value, but that value is created in real production, involving the work of billions of workers. If those workers are not there, it leaves only a derelict area or ghost town situation (see also: decline of Detroit).Paul Harris, \\"How Detroit, the Motor City, turned into a ghost town.\\" The Guardian, 1 November 2009. The Greek Marxian economist John Milios also argues for a monetary theory of value, where \\"Money is the necessary form of appearance of value (and of capital) in the sense that prices constitute the only form of appearance of the value of commodities.\\" Critics of this interpretation think that it cannot be correct, for three reasons: *Marx makes it explicit that \\"although price, being the exponent of the magnitude of a commodity's value, is the exponent of its exchange ratio with money, it does not follow that the exponent of this exchange-ratio is necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of the commodity's value.\\"Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 196. That is to say, prices need not express product-values accurately, or at all. *As Marx so painstakingly showed in his discussion of the development of the form of value, the value of commodities can also be expressed simply and directly in terms of a quantity of other commodities, or one referent commodity. To express a value relationship, in principle no money or prices are required at all ‚Äì that is the whole point. All that is required is the expression that \\"x quantity of product y is worth p quantity of product q\\", whether y and q happen to be traded or not. *Milios's argument can be sustained only if, in the trade of one bundle of commodities for another (as in counter-trade), the bundle of commodities traded is itself treated as if it is a \\"price\\". But such a \\"price\\" is obviously not a quantity of money. The point here is simply that the form of value, in its less developed state, does not require any monetary expression; counter-trade does not necessarily require any monetary referent at all, although in modern times it often does take into account the cash value of a deal. Milios conflated the money that actually changes hands with all kinds of possible computable price data for a commodity under various conditions. Effectively, he conflated the form of value with the price-form, and real prices with ideal prices. Milios implies, that only priced goods can have value, but this idea flatly contradicts Marx's theory according to which product-values exist also quite independently from exchange (simply because products necessarily represent quantities of labour-effort). If Milios's interpretation is correct, Marx's value theory serves no good purpose‚Äîvalues and prices are hardly distinguishable. In all his economic manuscripts, Marx says that at best prices are the \\"idealized expression\\" of the forms of value. This view is only logical; after all, prices express the quantity of money for which particular commodities will, or could, change owners. If the idealization of the form of value as a price is equated with the value-form itself, the whole value-form idea is itself redundant. It is a bit like saying, that the price information about a good is the same thing as the actual money that changes hands when the good is traded. Most people know very well what the difference is; they could hardly afford not to know it. =Value as power= In various works, the Australian phenomenologist Michael Eldred radicalizes the reading of 'form' in the value-form concept so that it becomes a socio-ontological category.Michael Eldred, Critique of competitive freedom and the bourgeois-democratic state: outline of a form-analytic extension of Marx's uncompleted system. Copenhagen: Kurasje, 1984; Michael Eldred,Social Ontology: Recasting Political Philosophy Through a Phenomenology of Whoness. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2008; Michael Eldred, Anglophone Justice Theory, the Gainful Game and the Political Power Play, 2011. According to Eldred, the phenomenon of exchange-value is substantially one of social power. Hence, money reveals itself to be the quintessential, rudimentary form of reified social power in capitalist society. The further value-forms developed during the course of the capital-analysis, starting with the capital-form and the wage-form of value, through the value-forms of ground-rent, interest, profit of enterprise, to the revenue-form of these income-sources on the surface of economic life, unfold the socio-ontological structure and movement of capitalism as a \\"reified power-play\\". Eldred argues that such a total ontological structure of capitalist power-play can only come into view, if the whole of Marx's capital-analysis is reconstructed, not just the famous, notoriously difficult first chapter of Marx's Capital. From a different angle, Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler Home - The Bichler and Nitzan Archives also depict the phenomena of economic value as power relationships.In their book Capital as power (Routledge, 2009). While retaining some of the language of Marx, they however reject Marx's theory of value.D. T. Cochrane, \\"Castoriadis, Veblen, and the 'Power Theory of Capital'\\". In: Ingerid Straume and J.F. Humphrey, Depoliticization: The Political Imaginary of Global Capitalism. Aarhus: Nordic Summer University Press, 2011, pp. 89-123. The power dimension of value relationships is also prominent in Harry Cleaver's commentary Reading Capital Politically.Harry Cleaver, Reading Capital Politically. University of Texas Press, 1979. This interpretation also has its critics, the main criticism being that by reducing all economic values to a matter of power, the concept of power itself becomes a nebulous idea, which explains \\"everything and nothing\\". For example, Andrew Kliman argues that Nitzan & Bichler seek to define power \\"in terms of market capitalization\\". On this view, \\"a market cap that is 1000 times as great as the average doesn't give the owners 1000 times as much power; it simply is 1000 times as much power.\\" Kliman says that \\"This identification of capital and power‚Äîcapital as power‚Äîis certainly not correct in a literal sense.\\"Andrew Kliman, \\"Value and Crisis: Bichler and Nitzan versus Marx.\\" in: Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies, issue 4, 2011, p.67. \\"Power\\", like economic value, is by no means a straightforward, simple concept.S. Bowles, M. Franzini and U. Pagano (eds.), The politics and economics of power. New York: Routledge, 2005. Power is often circumstantial. It cannot be automatically inferred, from the position taken by participants in market trade, what kind of power they really have.Robert H.Bork & J. Gregory Sidak, \\"The misuse of profit margins to infer market power\\". Journal of Competition Law & Economics, Vol. 9, No. 3 2013, pp. 511-530. Particularly in economic crises, it is often discovered that those who were thought to have a lot of power, do not really have it (leading to political crises). =Subjective and objective= There are also anthropologists such as the socialist Lawrence Krader and the anarchist David Graeber who have argued that Marx's value categories should be modified in the light of historical and anthropological research about how human communities value objects.Lawrence Krader, A Treatise of Social Labour. Assen: Van Gorcum, 1979 and Labor and value, ed. by Cyril Levitt and Rod Hay. New York: Peter Lang, 2003. David Graeber, \\"Value: anthropological theories of value\\", in: James G. Carrier, A Handbook of Economic Anthropology. Edward Elgar, 2005, p. 453. Ever since Werner Sombart and Nikolai Bukharin first argued it,In The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (completed 1914), Bukharin cites Werner Sombart's review article \\"Zur Kritik des oekonomischen Systems von Karl Marx\\", in Archiv f√ºr soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik, vol. VII, 1894, pp. 591, 592. Translated as: Werner Sombart, \\"A Contribution to the Critique of Karl Marx's Economic System (1894)\\", in: Richard B. Day and Daniel Gaido (eds.), Responses to Marx's Capital; From Rudolf Hilferding to Isaak Illich Rubin. Leiden: Brill, 2017, pp.162‚Äì211. See further David P. Levine, Subjectivity in political economy. Essays on wanting and choosing. London: Routledge, 1998. Marx's theory of value has been described as a purely objective theory of value, as opposed to the subjective theory of the bourgeois economists.J. E. King and Michael McLure, \\"History of the concept of value\\". Discussion paper 14.06, Business School, University of Western Australia, 2014. However, Krader argued (just like Mikhail Tugan-BaranovskyFran√ßois Allisson, \\"Tugan- Baranovsky's synthesis\\", chapter 5 in: Fran√ßois Allisson, Value and Prices in Russian Economic Thought. Milton Park: Routledge, 2015, pp. 109-132. and Oskar R. Lange) that Marx's theory of value and the theory of utility are compatible, i.e., the one does not exclude the other; and Krader insisted that value has both objective and subjective aspects. Graeber's work is very focused on how value categories shape human lives, and the direct political effects of that.David Graeber, Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Own Dreams. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. To understand and aggregate the subjective preferences that determine trading choices and economic decisions in the real world, those subjective preferences themselves have to be treated as knowable, objective and measurable data. Therefore, even a subjective theory of value cannot get away entirely from treating value also as an objective social fact. If that wasn't the case, then all economic statistics and marketing research would be invalid and useless. It follows that in the real world, all economists always have to deal with both subjective value and value as an objective market reality. True, Marx focused mainly on the overall objective outcomes of capitalist valuations. Individual workers and individual owners of capital could not determine what the markets were going to do, although important decisions by politicians can strongly influence the markets. Yet that obviously did not mean, that workers and capitalists made no subjective valuations or choices at all, or that they were completely at the mercy of market forces.\\"To prevent possible misunderstanding, a word. I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class-relations and class-interests. My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.\\" - Karl Marx, Preface to Capital, Volume I. On this view, value cannot exist without the presence of valuing subjects, it is just that the value of objects escapes from their control, and starts to lead a life of its own, independent from the volitions of particular individuals. Paradoxically, as Marx himself says, the more that producers become dependent on exchange, the more exchange appears to become independent of them.Karl Marx, Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58, in Karl Marx Frederick Engels Collected Works, Vol. 28 (New York: International Publishers, 1986), p. 834. That is, markets can not only favour the interests of the individual, but can also work against the interests of the individual, because they have their own independent dynamics. Market movements can be quite different from what people expected or predicted, giving rise to many theories of market expectations, to fathom how trading patterns and people's expectations interact and influence each other. =More Heat than Light= In his widely-read book More Heat than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics, Philip Mirowski examined in greater detail the theoretical conflicts between \\"substance\\" theories of value and \\"field\\" theories of value.Philip Mirowski, More Heat than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. He claims that \\"Marx vacillated between two mutually exclusive labor theories of value\\", which according to him explains \\"the incoherence of his attempt to solve the transformation problem\\". One theory is the \\"embodied\\" labour theory of value (or crystallized labour), the other theory is a \\"cost\\" theory of value. \\"Crystalized labor highlights exploitation and fixes the locus of surplus generation in production; real-cost labor values obscure the generation of surplus and open up the possibility that the global magnitude of profit is altered (and hence generated) in exchange\\".Mirowski, p. 184. This interpretation is essentially a version of the conventional neo-Ricardian critique, which claims there is an unbridgeable inconsistency between the value theory of Capital, Volume I and the value theory of Capital, Volume III. Mirowski claims that Marx, in the tradition of classical political economy, believed that \\"regular capitalist trades are normally trades of equivalent values\\"Mirowski, p. 178. This claim is not easy to sustain, since the whole architecture of Capital, Volume III is built upon the idea that product- values, prices of production and market prices systematically diverge from each other, and can diverge very considerably for a prolonged time ‚Äì profit- making does not require that commodities trade at their values, and, as Marx himself notes at the beginning of Capital, Volume III, good profits can be made by trading large quantities of goods quite fast below their value (the classical principle of competition). According to Ian Paul Wright, \\"Mirowski unfortunately misreads Marx's concept of substance.\\"Ian Paul Wright, The Law of Value: A Contribution to the Classical Approach to Economic Analysis.

Marx was primarily concerned with the value of newly produced commodities, but it is unclear from his theory about the capitalist mode of production what determines the value of a growing stock of durable assets in society, a stock of assets which is neither an input nor an output of current production (except for the maintenance labour for already existing physical and financial assets). Contrary to a pernicious but popular myth, Marx only provided a theory of the foundations of capitalist society, its characteristic mode of production.\\"What I have to examine in this work is the capitalist mode of production, and the relations of production and forms of intercourse that correspond to it\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition 1976, p. 90. He did not provide a theory of the total economy, or a theory of the whole of bourgeois society. That is why, later on, Marxist and critical social scientists were forced to develop Marx's insights much further in many new areas.For example, Ben Fine, The world of consumption. London: Routledge, 2nd ed. 2002; Heide Gerstenberger, Impersonal power: history and theory of the bourgeois state. Chicago: Haymarket, 2009; Lise Vogel, Marxism and the oppression of women. Chicago: Haymarket, 2013; Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: competition, conflict, crises. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016. The old reproduction schemes of Otto Bauer, Nikolai Bukharin, Rosa Luxemburg, Henryk Grossman, Ernest Mandel and other famous Marxists all have in common, that they assume that the income obtained from the use of capital and labour is either used up in consumption expenditure, or re-invested in production.Shinzaburo Koshimura, Theory of capital reproduction and accumulation. Kitchener, Ontario: DPG Publishing Co., 1975, p. 17f. But this conflates the theory of the self-reproduction of the capitalist mode of production with the reproduction of capitalist society as a whole, and it conflates the accumulation of production capital with the accumulation of total social capital. Ernest Mandel partly admitted this ‚Äì he stated that it was an error to think that a nation's resources are simply divided into a consumption fund and productive investment fund, with a zero-sum trade-off between them. There is also an \\"unproductive investment fund\\", which finances government administration, military spending, elite maintenance and entourage, luxuries, prestige goods, hoarded savings, speculation, tax havens etc. Hence, if austerity policies reduce the consumption fund, this does not automatically increase the productive investment fund - it might only increase the unproductive investment fund.Ernest Mandel, The second slump. London: Verso, 1978, p. 198; Ernest Mandel, \\"Marx and Engels on Commodity Production and Bureaucracy\\". In: Stephen Resnick & Richard Wolff (eds.), Rethinking Marxism: essays for Harry Magdoff & Paul Sweezy. New York: Autonomedia, 1985, p. 243; Geoffrey R. Pearce, Where is New Zealand Going?. Phd dissertation, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, 1986. Inversely, Keynesian-type pump-priming techniques (stimulus techniques) aiming to boost consumer demand, may increase neither ordinary consumer expenditure nor productive investments by very much, if they just enrich the administrators of the stimulus program and financial institutions, and if the extra subsidy given to citizens and organizations is in reality largely spent on paying off or rescheduling/refinancing debt. In a globalized, leveraged economy, even if local consumer expenditure does rise, it does not mean automatically that local productive investment will increase also - the main effect of increased consumer spending may only be to boost imports, and not to develop the local economy. In reality, as capitalist development advances, the share of non-productive accumulation in total accumulation keeps growing, as shown by capital market dataMcKinsey Global Institute, Mapping global capital markets: Fifth annual report. Washington, D.C.: McKinsey & Company, October 2008. and data on the national asset wealth for the advanced capitalist countries.Most OECD countries nowadays publish national wealth and asset data, using surveys, administrative data and tax information as a basis for the estimates. This means that the overall structure of capital holdings, nationally and internationally, bears very little resemblance anymore to what that structure looked like in Marx's and Keynes's time. =Non-material goods= In value theory, there is also the problem of so-called \\"non-material goods and services\\", such as intellectual property (all kinds of texts, data sets, software, designs, techniques, knowledge, inventions, information services etc.).Eran Fisher & Christian Fuchs, Reconsidering value and labour in the digital age. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015; Christian Fuchs & Vincent Mosco, Marx in the age of digital capitalism. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2016. Sometimes scholars refer to \\"cognitive commodities\\".Guido Starosta, \\"Cognitive Commodities and the Value- Form\\". Science & Society, Vol. 76, No. 3, July 2012, 365‚Äì392. Obviously intellectual property existed already in Marx's time, but its scope and volume was fairly small.Steve Lohr, \\"New Economy; The intellectual property debate takes a page from 19th-century America\\". New York Times, 14 October 2002. In modern times, in which science and education have become large-scale businesses, there is a general tendency to attach a property right and a price-tag to more and more ideas, which are given precise boundaries (See World Intellectual Property Organization).Michael Perelman, Steal This Idea; Intellectual Property and the Corporate Confiscation of Creativity. Palgrave Macmillan, 2003; Hal Varian, Economics of Information Technology. March 23, 2003. Working paper, University of California, Berkeley, 2003. However, it remains unclear what regulates the value of intellectual property in an economic sense.Hamid R. Ekbia and Bonnie A. Nardi, Heteromation, and Other Stories of Computing and Capitalism. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2017. Hamid R. Ekbia and Bonnie A. Nardi, \\"Heteromation and its (dis)contents: the invisible division of labour between humans and machines.\\" First Monday, Volume 19, Number 6, June 2014. How is the value of intellectual property correctly defined and calculated? Often the prices paid for intellectual assets are not proportional to real production costs.Michael Perelman, Information, social relations and the economics of high technology. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1991, chapter 5, p. 190f. Neo-Ricardian critique This criticism (made primarily by neo-Ricardians and post-Keynesians) is basically that all the problems Marx tries to solve with his theory of the forms of value can be solved much better and more plausibly with modern price theory. =Meek= In a 1975 paper subtitled \\"Was Marx's Journey Really Necessary?\\", the influential Marxian economist Ronald L. Meek argued that Marx's value theory had become redundant, because all economic relationships can be described and explained in terms of prices.Ronald L. Meek, \\"From values to prices: was Marx's journey really necessary?\\". In: Ronald L. Meek, Smith, Marx and after. Ten essays in the development of economic thought. London: Chapman & Hall, 1997, pp. 120-133. Indeed, what Marx calls \\"value\\" can be regarded simply as a kind of \\"theoretical price\\". In this interpretation, the conclusion drawn is that Marx's value theory really adds nothing much to the economic arguments, and is therefore probably best abandoned.Ian Steedman, Marx after Sraffa. London: NLB, 1977; Marco Lippi, Value and naturalism in Marx. London: New Left Books, 1979, p. 132; Pierangelo Garegnani, \\"Value and distribution in the classical economists and Marx.\\" Oxford Economic Papers, Vol. 36, Issue 2, June 1984, pp. 291-325. =Response= Most Western Marxists had accepted the conventional price-theories of economics as largely correct and unproblematic,Thus, for example, in his textbook Monetary Theory (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1981) the prominent English Marxian economist Laurence Harris, well known for his contributions to Marxian value theory, paid no attention to the price-form itself. and just kept insisting that value-theory was a necessary \\"add-on\\" to make sense of the economy. Alternatively, Marxists argued that value theory had nothing much to do with the market economics of prices, because it referred to a quite different \\"level of abstraction\\" or had a different intention.Diane Elson (ed.), Value: the representation of labour in capitalism. London: CSE books, 1979. Paolo Giussani, \\"La 'value-form school'\\" (in Italian). Rob Bryer stated in 2005 that \\"The majority of Marxists today argue defensively that [Marx] did not intend [his theory of value] to explain prices and rate of return on capital, but gave us only a qualitative theory of capitalist exploitation\\".Rob Bryer, \\"Marx, accounting and the labour theory of value: A critique of Marxist economics.\\" University of Warwick paper presented to the 5th European Critical Accounting Studies Conference, 2005, p. 1. There was no systematic critique of price theory, and almost no attempt to connect the \\"transformation problem\\" controversy to the socialist calculation debate. When, in his neo-Ricardian attack on Marx's value theory, Ian Steedman simply disregarded all market prices altogether (all prices in Steedman's models are purely hypothetical production pricesIan Steedman, Marx after Sraffa. London: NLB, 1977, p. 20.), there was no objection from the Marxist camp, although there were plenty of other criticisms.Anwar Shaikh pointed out in 2016 (in his Capitalism, p. 237) that \\"by focusing on prices of production throughout\\", Sraffa \\"avoids the transformation problem inherent in his own analysis\\". =Shaikh= In his 2016 magnum opus, the classical economist Anwar Shaikh argues that all the main economic propositions of Marx's Capital can be demonstrated in a coherent way and verified empirically‚Äîwithout any necessary reference to Marx's own dialectical narrative about value, a position proved to be controversial.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016. Shaikh devised techniques to test classical theories of value empirically, using input-output data, capital stock data, labour data, price indexes and incomes data. He claims that generally the deviation of estimated labour-values from the corresponding observable market prices of outputs is not very great (maximally around 1/8th or so), which suggests that the classical transformation problem is empirically much less significant than previously thought.\\"The crosssectional variations in the calculated prices of production are entirely dominated by the corresponding variations in relative values, with between 87% and 92% of the former being explained by the latter.\\" - Anwar Shaikh, \\"The Transformation from Marx to Sraffa\\", in: Ernest Mandel & Alan Freeman, Ricardo, Marx, Sraffa. London: Verso, 1984, pp. 43-84, at p. 73. \\"...measured in terms of their average absolute percentage deviations, prices of production are within 8.2 per cent of market prices, labour values are within 9.2 per cent of market prices and 4.4 per cent of prices of production, and the linear approximation is within 2 per cent of full prices of production and 8.7 per cent of market price.\\" - Anwar Shaikh, \\"the Empirical Strength of the Labor Theory of Value\\". In: Riccardo Bellofiore (ed.), Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal, Volume 2. New York: St Martin's Press, 1998, p. 226.

The strength of the econometric approach is that, if the task is to measure value, then it is essential to get conceptually very exact about what value is, in order to measure it, even if the empirical measure is only a proxy for the real thing. Chartalist critique An implicit technical and historical criticism of Marx's value-form theory is made by some Post KeynesianWray, L. Randall. \\"Modern Money\\", Levy Economics Institute, Working Paper No. 252. 1998Stephanie Bell \\"The role of the state and the hierarchy of money\\", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 25, issue 2, 2001, pp. 149‚Äì163Mathew Forstater, \\"Taxation and primitive accumulation: the case of colonial Africa\\",Research in Political Economy series, Vol. 22, 2005, pp. 51‚Äì64. and heterodox Marxian economistsPaul Cockshott; Dave Zachariah, \\"Credit crunch: origins and orientation\\", Science & Society, Vol. 74, No. 3, July 2010, pp. 343‚Äì361 as well as anarchists like David Graeber,David Graeber, Debt: the first 5,000 years, Brooklyn: Melville House, 2010 who are inspired by the chartalist theory of money. These economists interpret Marx's narrative about how money originates in the exchange process as a theory of commodity money, or the \\"commodity theory of money\\". That is, they believe that Marx's theory is more or less the same as the \\"barter theory of money\\". =MMT= The \\"neo-Chartalist\\" interpretation of money entails, that the commodity theory of money is false;Tcherneva, Pavlina R. \\"Chartalism and the tax-driven approach \\", in Philip Arestis & Malcolm C. Sawyer, A handbook of alternative monetary economics, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2006Tcherneva, Pavlina R. \\"The Nature, Origins, and Role of Money: Broad and Specific Propositions and Their Implications for Policy\\", Center for Full Employment and Price Stability, University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City, Working Paper No. 46, July 2005 the latter, it is argued by neo-chartalists, can neither explain the origin of money and credit, nor provide a credible account of monetary phenomena in the modern world.Wray, L. Randall. \\"The Neo- Chartalist Approach to Money\\", Center for Full Employment and Price Stability, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Working Paper No. 10, July 2000 Chartalists argue that money is completely \\"a creature of the state\\"‚Äîit first arises as a unit of account for state debts, credits and taxes, and is then gradually imposed on the whole of the trading process in society.Wray, L. Randall. (ed.), Credit and State Theories of Money: The Contributions of A. Mitchell Innes. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2004. If this Chartalist argument is true, then it cannot also be true that, as Marx argues, money originates as a \\"special commodity\\" (a referent of value and a universally exchangeable good) within the exchange process itself. The neo-Chartalist theory is known as Modern Monetary Theory (MMT).Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, \\"The Rock-Star Appeal of Modern Monetary Theory\\". The Nation, May 8, 2017. There exist also quite a number of other credit theories of money which differ to one degree or another from MMT, with different policy conclusions. The controversy about this challenge to Marx's idea is far from being resolved at this stage,See Costas Lapavitsas, \\"Money as 'universal equivalent' and its origin in commodity exchange.\\" Working Paper, Department of Economics, SOAS, University of London, May 2003. for five reasons. =No consensus= Firstly, there is nowadays no consensus view among Marxists about Marx's theory of money.Pichit Likitkijsomboon, Marx's Theory of Money: A Critique. PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, 1990. *Some Marxists deny that Marx had any full-fledged theory of money in the modern sense of the word, since he never developed any substantive theory of money circulation and public finance; Marx had deliberately kept his discussion of money and bank capital brief, it is argued, because he aimed only to explain the nature of the capitalist mode of production as simply as possible. *Some Marxists, like Thomas T. Sekine, regard the value-form discussion as a purely theoretical discussion with no bearing on empirical or historical reality; its main purpose is just to show why money necessarily emerges from the exchange of products, not how exactly it originates.Thomas T. Sekine, An outline of the dialectic of capital, Vol. 1. London: Macmillan, 1997. *Some Marxists, such as Ernest Mandel and John Weeks,Ernest Mandel, \\"Introduction\\" to Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976. p. 75. John Weeks \\"The Theory and Empirical Credibility of Commodity Money\\". Science & Society, Vol. 76, No. 1, 2012, pp. 66-94. have argued that Marx really did have a commodity theory of money. *Others argue that (a) a commodity-money theory can only be a \\"special case\\" of a more general theory of money, or (b) that it is a purely theoretical/analytical assumption, or (c) that it applied only in a certain period in history, or (d) Marx did not have or need a commodity theory of money.Michael Williams, \\"Why Marx neither has nor needs a commodity theory of money\\", Review of Political Economy, Vol. 12 No. 4, 435-451. *Some Marxists think that Marx's theory is substantially the same as the barter theory of money, while others argue it is very different from the barter theory. So, there exists no general agreement about the exact theoretical status of Marx's theory of money.Carlo Panico, \\"Marx on the Banking Sector and the Interest Rate: Some Notes for a Discussion\\". Science & Society Vol. 52, No. 3 (Fall, 1988), pp. 310‚Äì325; Carlo Panico, Interest and profit in the theories of value and distribution. London: Macmillan, 1988; Makoto Itoh and Costas Lapavitsas, Political Economy of Money and Finance. London: Macmillan, 1999. The core problem here is, that in its evolution across millennia of trading activity, money itself has taken a multiplicity of different forms,Paul Einzig, Primitive money in its ethnological, historical and economic aspects. Pergamon, 1966; Jack Weatherford, The history of money. Crown Business reprint, 1998; Niall Ferguson, The ascent of money. Penguin books, 2009; Robert J.

London: Routledge, 2014; Felix Martin, Money: The Unauthorized Biography - from coinage to cryptocurrencies. New York: Vintage, 2015. and new types of monetary transactions keep emerging, that were previously unheard of (see also e.g. electronic money, collateralized debt obligation, credit default swap and cryptocurrency).Bill Maurer, How Would You Like to Pay?: How Technology Is Changing the Future of Money. Duke University Press Books, 2015. For almost the whole history of commercial capitalism from the 15th century onward, currencies were used which were convertible into gold and silver, but from 1971 onward, most currencies have become fiat money (see Nixon shock). =Money's origins= Secondly, the analysis of the historical and archaeological evidence about the real origins of moneyMichael Hudson, \\"The Archaeology of Money: Debt versus Barter Theories of Money's Origins.\\" Chapter 5 in: L. Randall Wray, Credit and State Theories of Money: The Contributions of A. Mitchell Innes. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2004. is not simply a matter of \\"facts\\", but also a matter of the interpretation of the facts using theoretical frameworks.Jan Lucassen (ed.), Wages and currency: global comparisons from antiquity to the twentieth century. Bern: Peter Lang, 2007 ; R.J. Van der Spek, Jan Luiten van Zanden & Bas van Leeuwen (eds.), A History of Market Performance from Ancient Babylonia to the Modern World. London: Routledge, 2014.

When is money really money?George Dalton, \\"Primitive money\\". In: American anthropologist, new Series, Vol. 67, No. 1 February 1965, pp. 44‚Äì65.

Special issue: \\"Chiefdoms: theories, problems and comparisons\\". Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2011. How economists will interpret the historical record of human exchange processes is influenced by their theory of how markets work in the modern world, and by how they define monetary phenomena.Eladio Febrero, \\"Three difficulties with Neo-Chartalism\\". Bilbao: XI Jornadas de Econom√≠a Cr√≠tica, 2008. The further one goes back into the past, however, the more fragmentary the scientific evidence about the circulation of goods is, and the more interpretation is involved to understand how it worked. It is easy to project a modern understanding of money into the past, even although money was understood quite differently in the past, or money functioned differently in the past, because people were related and relating in a different way.Pierre Berger, quoted in Pierre Vilar, A History of Gold and Money, 1450‚Äì1920. London: New Left Books, 1976, p. 7. =Disagreement= Thirdly, beyond Keynesian and Marxist theories about money, there is a lot of controversy and theoretical disagreement within the discipline of economics as a whole about money, credit and finance.OECD, The future of money. Paris: OECD, 2002; Jan Toporowski, 2013 audio lectures on the international financial system and macroeconomic imbalances, at the University of Bergamo, Italy. Representatives of different schools of thought in economics often cannot agree at a very basic scientific level about the causes and effects of monetary phenomena, even if they share the same elementary concepts about the circulation of money.Marshall Sahlins, Waiting for Foucault, Still. Chicago: Prickly Paradigm Press, 2002, p. 30. They are therefore likely also to interpret economic developments in quite different ways. =Few Marxist works= Fourthly, as a matter of fact, very few Marxian economists have studied monetary economics in any detail, and there are few significant Marxist works on the role of money in the economy.See Karl Kautsky, \\"Gold, Paper Currency and commodity\\" introduced by David Gaido (MIA archive); Hilferding, Finance Capital; Ernest Mandel, Decline of the dollar: a Marxist view of the monetary crisis. New York: Monad Press, 1972. Isaak Illich Rubin, \\"Studien zur Geldtheorie von Marx\\". Beitr√§ge zur Marx-Engels-Forschung. Neue Folge, Sonderband 4, 2012; Makoto Itoh and Costas Lapavitsas, Political economy of money and finance. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002; Suzanne de Brunhoff, Marx on money. London, Verso, 2015 reprint; Fred Moseley (ed.), Marx's theory of money: modern appraisals. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005; Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism, Oxford University Press, 2016, chapter 5; Costas Lapavitsas, Marxist Monetary theory. Leiden: Brill, 2017; Michel Aglietta, Money. 5,000 Years of Debt and Power. London: Verso, 2018. =SFC model= Fifthly, when economists try to \\"modernize\\" Marx's view of money, they strike the problem that in orthodox economics the \\"macro-theory\\" of money is very different from the \\"micro-theory\\" of money. The way economists think that money functions at the macro-level of society as a whole, differs a lot from the way they say money functions at the level of individuals and businesses.Prof. Victoria Chick, \\"Why don't academics understand money?\\". Paper presented at the Positive Money Conference, January 2013. They have one story for transactions between individuals or individual enterprises, and quite another story for the \\"big picture\\". According to Marxist, classical and post-Keynesian economists such as Wynne Godley, Marc Lavoie, Steve Keen, Edward J. Nell and Anwar Shaikh, this creates all kinds of theoretical inconsistencies. To overcome the inconsistencies, post-Keynesian Marxists try to create a so-called \\"stock/flow consistent model\\" of monetary transactions, which can explain the circulation process of money, commodities and capital in an integral way. This approach is needed especially because \\"unfortunately, the finance sector is one of the more poorly measured sectors in national accounts\\".Dennis J Fixler, Marshall B Reinsdorf and Shaunda Villones, \\"Measuring the services of commercial banks in the NIPA.\\" IFC Bulletin No. 33 (Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics, Bank of International Settlements), 2007. =Pre-sovereign money= The main objection to the Chartalist theory of the origins of money is that, for the largest part of recognizably human history, economic exchange in whatever form took place without using a sovereign currency, and that all kinds of physical goods (such as minerals, cattle, hides, shells and slaves) were used as a kind of money.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: competition, conflict, crises. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 169f. That is, commodity money existed long before sovereign currency emerged, and the economic significance of the early state was very small.Paul Einzig, Primitive money in its ethnological, historical and economic aspects. Pergamon, 1966. On this view, sovereign currency could replace non-sovereign currency, only because there already existed a lot of experience in trading with non-sovereign currency beforehand. This does not deny that informal and contractual lending/borrowing arrangements also already existed in ancient times, but currency was not even necessary for that. Because labour productivity was comparatively low, the surplus product was relatively small and the ability of early states to appropriate it through levies and taxes was usually also limited (though e.g. the Aztec emperors apparently hoarded cocoa beans, and at one time owned a stockpile of some 960,000,000 beans).Ato de Graft-Johnson, \\"From Maya to market\\". The New Internationalist, 5 August 1998. In addition, large trading houses‚Äîsuch as the Dutch East India Company‚Äîsometimes issued their own currency, quite independently of the state (see: Dutch East India Company coinage). So the ability of tokens of value (e.g. cryptocurrency) to function as money does not necessarily depend on the state at all, even although, in the modern era, money has mostly taken the form of state-issued currency and, after the demise of the Bretton-Woods Agreement is always in the form of fiat money. =Tally- sticks= Neo-Chartalists argue however that, although we will never be certain, for lack of definite archaeological proofs, about the origins of money, the first instances of units of account are debt markets, the so-called \\"tally sticks\\" in antiquity. Money issued is always debt issued, and, therefore, the notion that money originated as a means of exchange first is regarded as false.Innes, A. Mitchell. Credit and State Theories of Money: The Contributions of A. Mitchell Innes; Wray, L. Randall (editor); Edward Elgar; May 2004; Wray, L. Randall. \\"The Credit Money and State Money Approaches\\". April 2004 Libertarian critique A fifth line of criticism, articulated especially by libertarians such as Friedrich von Hayek and the Austrian School, concerns the role of value in human freedom and progress. Marx and Engels tended to present \\"value\\" and \\"value relations\\" as negative, alienating and reifying phenomena that cause people to get used by others, for ends they can no longer fathom. Therefore, markets appear to be evil things, and the conclusion then follows that people are better off without them. Yet market value can also be viewed as a very positive thing. Hayek stated that: According to Marxists, value phenomena belong to the prehistory of humanity that closes with the abolition of capitalism.Scott Meikle, Essentialism in the thought of Karl Marx. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co. Ltd, 1985, p. 95. Thus, for example, Iring Fetscher claims: \\"Marx's criticism is directed against value as such, not merely against its consequence, capital.\\"Iring Fetscher et al., Social classes, action and historical materialism. Pozna≈Ñ studies in the philosophy of the sciences and the humanities, Vol. 6. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1982, p. 27. Similarly, Moishe Postone argued that Marx was mainly concerned with \\"the abolition of value as the social form of wealth.\\"Moishe Postone, Time, Labor, and Social Domination, p. 27. In other words, the negative, dehumanizing features of market valuations for workers' lives have had prominence for Marxists,Murray E.G. Smith, Invisible Leviathan: The Marxist Critique of Market Despotism beyond Postmodernism. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994. even although Marx also acknowledges here and there that markets have some progressive, developmental and \\"civilizing\\" features.E.g. Karl Marx, Grundrisse, Penguin edition 1973, pp. 287, 325, 527‚Äì29, 707‚Äì12, etc. Marx and Engels seem to depict the forms of value as an alien, impersonal and corruptive force that gradually subordinates anything and everything to \\"making money\\" ‚Äî and it leads to the reification of human life (and to wars). This opens up a far-reaching and complex theme of criticism. There are many libertarian criticisms of Marxism and socialism ‚Äì economic, political, moral and technical. In the context of this article, five points are particularly relevant (whether one agrees with them, or not). =Progress= The first objection is that the negative historical judgement about the capitalist market economy is not objective, because, on balance, the results for human civilization of the valuation of labour by capital have had much more progressive effect than Marx and Engels were willing to acknowledge. The proof is said to be, that workers themselves prefer choosing their own employer, purchasing goods at stable prices, and owning private property; market trade has improved their standard of living faster than any other method. On this view, Marxists exaggerated the \\"money-making\\" aspect of business, by simply ignoring many other human considerations involved in it (Marx wrote almost nothing on civil society and the sphere of consumption). =Value inevitable= A second objection is that Marxists are wrong to think that value disappears when commercial trade is abolished.Tadayuki Tsushima, \\"Understanding \\"Labor Certificates\\" on the Basis of the Theory of Value\\", in: Tadayuki Tsushima, Kuremuren no shinwa (\\"Myths of the Kremlin\\"), 1956. Here the argument is that humans would simply continue to make valuations anyway, and that goods continue to have value, except that knowing what exactly the magnitude of that value is, becomes much more problematic because a general, shared standard of valuation (expressed in money quantities) is absent.N. G. Pierson, \\"The problem of value in the socialist community\\", in: F. A. Hayek (ed.), Collectivist economic planning. London: Routledge & kegan Paul, 1935, pp. 41-86 The proof of this is supposed to be the experience of Soviet-type societies where a very large amount of goods was effectively \\"bartered\\" or allocated by government decree.Michael Voslensky, Nomenklatura. Anatomy of the Soviet ruling class. London: The Bodley Head, 1984. Janine Wedel, The private Poland; an anthropologist's look at everyday life. New York: Facts on file publications, 1986. Janine Wedel (ed.), The unplanned society; Poland during and after communism. New York: Columbia University Press, 1992. Even if there was no trade at all, however, the Soviet authorities knew very well that the products of human labour had value, and, with experience, planners could estimate fairly accurately how much labour would need to be employed to produce various kinds of outputs. More generally, it can be argued that human beings as moral subjects are intrinsically valuing subjects, and therefore human relations without values or valuations of some sort do not exist.\\"A world without values stops being a human civilization, looking rather like a society of Hymenoptera. Human beings would return to animality or change into a bio-mechanical aggregate. Directly or symbolically, values express people's projects, the constellation of their preferences professed and aimed at, the hierarchy of their preferences, their way of making a choice and being chosen. It is only through the values assumed and promoted that a person's synthetic project called happiness acquires shape.\\" ‚Äî Ludwig Gr√ºnberg,The Mystery of Values: Studies in Axiology. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2000, p. 127. At best one could say (as Marx did), that the type of value or valuation can change. =Freedom= A third objection is that people can distinguish quite well between the means/ends rationality of commerce, and non-commercial relationships.Max Weber sociologically distinguished already between an \\"instrumental rationality\\" (the efficiency of a means-ends relationship) and a \\"value rationality\\" (the reasonableness or valuation of goals in themselves). Therefore, it is simply an inaccurate and false subjective opinion to claim that there exists some kind of \\"monumental domination\\" of commercial relationships over people's lives, because that is not true‚Äîexcept perhaps for people who are obsessively focused on trading relationships. What is ignored is that markets can offer a freedom of choice and development to those who value themselves, and believe in their own self-worth.This is argued most powerfully by Milton Friedman in his book Free to Choose. This kind of argument suggests that the \\"oppression by economic value\\" or the \\"domination of economic value\\" only exists as a belief or an interpretation which itself can be oppressive. =Efficiency and fairness= A fourth objection made is that without the \\"discipline\\" and \\"incentives\\" of value relations, it is simply impossible to reconcile self-interest and the common interest in any efficient and fair manner, and achieve sensible cost-economies in the use of resources. Again, this is supposed to be proved by the resource waste and ecological damage suffered by Soviet-type societies.Richard Pipes has famously argued, in various writings, that the lack of a clear concept of private property in the communist era was a disaster for the Russian economy. According to Pipes, since in Muscovite society the Czar either owned or controlled practically all the assets of his empire, a mature tradition of private ownership never developed in Russia. If people don't have to work for a living, they will just try to live at the expense of other people. But giving people monetary rewards and costs as a framework to reckon with in making choices about their lives is vastly preferable to forcing them to work with the threat of real punishment if they don't.Tom Brass & Marcel van der Linden (ed.), Free and unfree labour: the debate continues. Peter Lang, 1998. =Trade persistence= A fifth objection is that it is practically impossible to abolish trade as such in complex societies, and that trade could not be prevented, even if a central state authority allocated resources to individuals through some kind of credit or rationing system. So long as people can privately own belongings, they will trade them, if it is in their interest to do so. In Soviet-type societies, trading continued to occur anyway, even if it was highly regulated, or driven underground (the \\"grey economy\\" or black market). Since there is practically no alternative to trading, it is argued the only dispute there can be, concerns the terms on which goods and services are traded‚Äîwhether that is efficient or morally justifiable. Any policy that aims to regulate or control how people may trade, libertarians argue, represents an attack on their liberty and presumes wrongly that the regulators know better what trade is beneficial, than the trading individuals do themselves (see further socialist calculation debate).A useful starter is: Dic Lo & Russell Smyth, \\"Towards a reinterpretation of the economics of feasible socialism.\\" Working paper, Dept. of Economics, SOAS, University of London, February 2002.; an overview of the socialist calculation debate from a libertarian viewpoint is provided in: David Ramsay Steele, From Marx to Mises: post-capitalist society and the challenge of economic calculation. La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Publishing Company, 1992. Many of the texts in the debate were usefully reprinted in: Peter Boettke et al. (ed.), Socialism or the market : the socialist calculation debate revisited (nine vols.). London : Routledge, 2000. This edition is out of print and rare, but the same texts are available from other sources. Response: market socialism Arguing against total statification such as in the Soviet Union, many modern socialist theorists have claimed however that markets aren't necessarily a bad thing. It all depends on how property rights and claims to resources are organized or institutionalized. Instead, they argue, markets should combine with non-market allocation methods within a market socialism.W≈Çodzimierz Brus, The Market in a Socialist Society. London: Routledge, 1972; Oskar Lange, Esconomic Theory and Market Socialism: Selected Essays of Oskar Lange, ed. Tadeusz Kowalik. Edward Elgar Publishing, 1994; Abba P.

Routledge, 1998. A very large amount of literature now exists on this topic, for and against. Similar to classical social-democratic reformism, the principle is argued that the more that economic goods are allocated by the market, the more the financially strong will defeat the financially weak, and the more socio-economic inequality there will be.Jawaharlal Nehru, \\"Basic Approach\\", reprinted in Vincent Shean, Nehru: the Years of Power. Random House, 1960, p. 295. David McNally, Against the Market: Political Economy, Market Socialism and the Marxist Critique. London: Verso, 1993. Therefore, it is argued, a more egalitarian society requires both market and non-market mechanisms, to allocate goods in a fair way. In this respect, there are many different possible combinations of argument.Julian Le Grand and Saul Estrin (eds.) Market Socialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. *In 1919, in the context of the Russian civil war, Nikolai Bukharin and Evgeny Preobrazhensky published the first comprehensive description of the transition to socialism, talking about \\"the abolition of private trade\\" (see also war communism).Nikolai Bukharin and Evgeny Preobrazhensky, The ABC of communism (introd. Edward H. Carr). Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969, p. 377. However, in his own 1924 study, written after the introduction of Lenin's New Economic Policy, Preobrazhensky recognized the persistence of trade in the transitional era. He claimed though that there was a fundamental contradiction between collective planning and markets.Evgeny Preobrazhensky, The New Economics. Transl. Brian Pearce, introd. Alec Nove. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965. This idea of a fundamental contradiction between planning and markets became enormously influential in later 20th century Marxist thought. However, when Bukharin wrote on his own about the transition to socialism, he was much more relaxed about market activity in the Soviet Union.Nikolai Bukharin, The Politics and Economics of the Transition Period. (edited with an Introduction by Kenneth J. Tarbuck, translated by Oliver Field). London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979. Stephen F. Cohen, Bukharin and the bolshevik revolution. A political biography 1888-1938 [1971]. New York: Vintage Books, 1975, chapter 6. Bukharin and Preobrazhensky were both executed on Stalin's orders during the Great Terror in 1937-38, but their ideas resurfaced from the 1960s onward, when Western scholars began to dig out the real historical record of Marxism. Stalin's general program was to eradicate capital markets and free enterprise completely, as well as bringing almost all independent producer and consumer cooperatives under state control: the abolition of almost all private ownership of means of production, which simultaneously abolished the commercial bourgeoisie as a social class in society. *Ludwig von Mises was already attacking the concept of market socialism in 1920, even before a detailed theory actually existed. This received replies from Karl Polanyi and Eduard Heimann in 1922.Don Lavoie, Rivalry and central planning: the socialist calculation debate reconsidered.

Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 311. Ellman argued that the evidence shows that Preobrazhensky's famous theory of \\"primitive socialist accumulation\\" simply did not hold water.Michael Ellman, \\"Did the agricultural surplus provide the resources for the increase in investment in the USSR during the First Five Year Plan?\\". Economic Journal, December 1975. In the end, Ellman concluded that \\"revolutionary social change aiming to eliminate the role of money and the market economy may well fail to eliminate inequality\\" and instead \\"simply change its causes\\".Michael Ellman, \\"Lest they be forgotten: inequality in non-capitalist economies during the 20th century\\". Real-world economics review, issue no. 86, 10 December 2018, pp. 106-118 . There could be more or less inequality, or different types of inequality in the allocation of resources. *One of the first theorists of market socialism was the Polish economist Oskar R. Lange who, fairly uniquely, aspired to integrate classical and neoclassical economics in one theory.Oskar R. Lange, \\"On the Economic Theory of Socialism, Part One,\\" Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 41, No. 1, 1936, pp. 53‚Äì71. Part Two, Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1937, pp. 123‚Äì142. In Lange's view, central planning by the state and market activity were quite compatible. The Japanese Marxist Kei Shibata was skeptical of Lange's theory and considered Hayek's criticism, arguing that Lange fell victim to the \\"old economic logic\\" that had to be discarded.Kei Shibata, \\"Economic theory of planning\\". In: Kyoto University Economic Review, Vol. 18, No. 4, 1943, pp. 19-41, at p. 41. Moishe Postone however agreed that \\"there is not even a necessary logical opposition between value and planning\\".Moishe Postone, Essays, p. 45. *Maurice Dobb published many books and papers on the controversy about market allocation versus economic planning.Maurice Dobb; & C. H. Feinstein, Socialism, capitalism and economic growth: essays presented to Maurice Dobb. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969 (2010 reprint). However, because Dobb was sympathetic to the Soviet Union,Timothy Shenk, Maurice Dobb: political economist. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, chapter 3. his writings were simply erased and deleted (like the writings of most other Marxist Soviet- sympathizers in the West) from the tradition of \\"Western Marxism\\" invented by New Left intellectuals like Perry Anderson,Michael Barratt Brown, Review of \\"Considerations on Western Marxism\\". in: Capital & Class, Vol. 2, Issue 2, July 1978, p. 142. Alex Callinicos and Marcel van der Linden. Therefore, very few people nowadays know what Dobb actually said. *In 1963‚Äì65, Che Guevara and Cuban treasury minister Luis Alvarez Rom spearheaded what came to be known as \\"the Great Debate\\" about the organization of the Cuban economy. It concerned primarily questions about the economic autonomy of enterprises, and the mix of material and moral incentives that would work best for the Cuban production system. An international conference was organized in Havana, which was attended by Ernest Mandel and Charles Bettelheim among others, to debate the theory of the transition to socialism.Bertram Silverman (ed.), Man and Socialism in Cuba; The Great Debate. New York: Atheneum, 1972. * The Czech socialist economist Ota ≈†ik, who appeared on Western TV stations numerous times, originally promoted market liberalization in Eastern Europe in the 1960s.Ota ≈†ik, Plan and market under socialism. White Plains, N.Y.: International arts and sciences press, 1967. However, he became increasingly critical of the system in operation, and began to regard it as \\"anti- socialist\\" and \\"neo-Stalinist\\" in the 1980s.Ota ≈†ik, The communist power system. New York: Praeger Publishers, 1981. He claimed that the existing political system of the communist party had presented an insurmountable obstacle to progressive economic reform. In the end, Ota ≈†ik's \\"third way\\" argued for a humane economic democracy: a method for the allocation of resources should be judged not on whether it conformed to a doctrine or principle, but whether it really met people's needs and improved their lives, i.e. on results.Ota ≈†ik, Humane Wirtschaftsdemokratie: ein 3. Weg. Hamburg: Knaus, 1979. In the 1990s, he tried to draw some theoretical lessons from the experience of what had, or had not been achieved.Ota ≈†ik (ed.), Socialism Today? The changing meaning of socialism. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd, 1991. In 1969, his countryman Petr Uhl had published a proposal for socialist self-management and democratization in Czechoslovakia.Peter Uhl, Die Herausforderung. Eine sozialistische Alternative zur 'Normaliserung in der CSSR'. Frankfurt: ISP Verlag, 1981. In 1978, V√°clav Havel, a leader of Charta 77, published his famous samizdat essay The Power of the Powerless. Havel argued that in neo-Stalinist Czechoslovakia, people had to behave \\"as if\\" they believed the state ideology, even if they did not believe it at all, and so, they were really \\"living a lie\\". This had, among other things, terrible economic effects, because it subverted the very possibility for honest and transparent transactions. *The Croatian socialist economist Branko Horvat championed a type of democratic market socialism and criticized excessive privatization and oppression of ethnic minorities.Branko Horvat, The Yugoslav economic system: the first labor managed economy in the making. [orig. 1976] London: Routledge, 2016 reprint. Branko Horvat, The political economy of socialism. London: Routledge, 1983. *The East German dissident Rudolf Bahro claimed in his widely read theoretical critique The Alternative in Eastern Europe (1977) that \\"actually existing socialism\\" had not been real socialism.Rudolf Bahro, The alternative in Eastern Europe. London: New Left Books/Verso, 1977. Subsequently, he became a leader of the West German Green Party, and devoted his last years mainly to the philosophy of spirituality. *One of Abel Aganbegyan's first books was called Regional studies for planning and projecting: the Siberian experience.Abel Gezevich AganbegiÔ∏†aÔ∏°n, Regional studies for planning and projecting : the Siberian experience. The Hague: Mouton, 1981. Subsequently, he rose to become one of the key economic advisors for Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika program to restructure the Soviet planned economy, and wrote many books about it, some of them translated into English.Aganbegyan's name is spelled in three alternative ways: Aganbegian, Aganbeg√¢n, Aganbegjan. His books include: Abel Gezevich Aganbegian & Michael Barratt Brown, The economic challenge of perestroika. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988; Abel Gezeviƒç Aganbeg√¢n, Perestroika 1989.

London: Bantam Books, 1989; and Abel Gezevich AganbegiÔ∏†aÔ∏°n, Inside perestroika: the future of the Soviet economy. New York: Perennial Library, 1990. In the first phase of perestroika, the state monopoly of foreign trade was abolished; in the second phase, many enterprises could trade part of their output on own initiative, and retain the profits. However, when Gorbachev lost his job, the envisaged Perestroika reform programme could no longer go ahead. *Yegor Gaidar believed that there was only one way to get out of the problems of Soviet socialism, and that was what amounted to an economic \\"shock therapy\\" of large- scale marketization and privatization (though he officially denied it was a \\"shock therapy\\"). This very radical program would demolish political resistance before the opponents of reform could mobilize and organize.Simon Clarke, The development of capitalism in Russia. Milton Park: Routledge, 2007, p. 7. Gaidar argued that \\"The arguments of Mises and Bruzkus, despite their coherence and consistency, are insufficient to explain the systemic causes of the crisis and death of Soviet communism, as well as the general reasons for its failure in competition with Western capitalism. A more painstaking analysis is required, one based on concrete historical experience.\\"Yegor Gaidar, \\"The Inevitability of Collapse of the Socialist Economy\\".

But, he asked, \\" why should we regard the capitalist 'free' market as the only possible one, and bureaucratic centralized control as the only possible form of planning? (...)

The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and the Marxist Analysis of Soviet Society. London: Macmillan, 1979. The Trotskyist and neo-Trotskyist critique of the \\"so-called socialist societies\\" is essentially that state allocation and market allocation were combined, but this had nothing to do with socialism, even although these societies called themselves \\"socialist\\" and claimed to build socialism. Therefore, the collapse of so-called socialist societies in their eyes does not prove that socialism is impossible, only that fake socialism is impossible to maintain, and that true socialism has never been implemented or put to the test anywhere, so far.Marcel van der Linden, Western Marxism and the Soviet Union: a survey of critical theories and debates since 1917. New York: Brill Publishers, 2007. Van der Linden does not deal with the socialist calculation debate, because it was pursued by Western Marxists and Liberals who fell outside his definition of Western Marxism. *Marxist‚ÄìLeninists regard the Trotskyist and International Socialist interpretation as supremely idealist and infantile,G√ºnter Krause und Klaus O. W. M√ºller, Der 'wahre' Marxismus des Ernest Mandel. Zur Kritik der politischen √ñkonomie des Linksradikalismus. Berlin: Verlag Die Wirtschaft, 1980. David Laibman, \\"The 'state capitalist' and 'bureaucratic-exploitative' interpretations of the Soviet social formation: a critique.\\" Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 10, No. 4, Winter 1978. because the Trotskyists and International Socialists lack any realistic understanding of socialist economics and socialist state management in the real world. The basic reason for this lack of understanding is that, if, as Trotskyists claim, there has never existed any actually-existing socialism, then there is nothing there that can be understood about socialism. All one can do, is analyze utopian dreaming, socialist hope, longing or yearning, or testimonies to a socialist faith, or spiritual sentiments about a \\"socialist heaven on earth\\" as ideal or utopian future.Joost Kircz,Technological Utopianism in the early USSR, and what does that mean for us now. Amsterdam: International Institute for Research and Education, Notebook #40, 2012. Or, one can complain about missing the ideal in reality, showing how the real does not live up to the ideal.Charles Bettelheim, The transition to socialist society. Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester Press, 1975, p. 150. Trotsky could lead by command and by executive orders \\"from above\\", but he was useless as a team-builder in civil life. When, after the civil war, he was appointed Commissar of Transport, he made himself very unpopular with the trade unions - by trying to convert the railway workers into a \\"labour army\\" with draconian military-style policies.Ian D. Thatcher, Trotsky. London: Routledge, 2003, p. 108. Isaac Deutscher, The prophet armed. New York: Vintage Books, 1965, chapter 14, pp. 498-503. Isaac Deutscher, Soviet Trade Unions. London: Oxford University Press, 1950. Most Marxist-Leninists agree, that the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin was socialist, but that Soviet socialism was later destroyed, because successive market reforms went much too far, and Soviet leaders became more and more right-wing‚Äîabandoning real Marxism. The Marxist-Leninists however disagree among themselves, when exactly capitalism was restored in the Soviet Union. For example, some will say it happened after the end of Stalin, i.e. in the Khrushchev era, some argued it happened after the Liberman reforms in the Brezhnev era, and some say it happened after the Gorbachov era when the Soviet Union collapsed. Similarly, some Chinese Marxist-Leninists think that China is now state capitalist, others think that it remains socialist \\"with Chinese characteristics\\", and some think it is partly capitalist and partly socialist. All these different viewpoints obviously cannot all be true at once.Robert Weil, Red Cat, White Cat: China and the Contradictions of \\"Market Socialism\\". New York: Monthly Review Press, 1996. It helps to explain, why the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist movement has fragmented since about 1960, just like the Trotskyist and neo-Trotskyist movement. *A substantive visionary statement of the Council Communists was Principles of Communist Production and Distribution. There was no space for markets in this communist system, and workers would be credited goods & services according to the labour they put in, according to some formula. In general, the Council Communists regarded the Soviet Union as a type of state capitalism, ruled over by a state bourgeoisie (comprising higher functionaries and managers in the government and party officialdom, who had special consumer privileges). Similar ideas occur in the essay \\"value and socialism\\" by Paul Mattick.Paul Mattick, Marx & Keynes. London: Merlin Press, 1971, pp. 307-331. *In his \\"Real Utopias project\\" since 1991, the analytical Marxist Erik Olin Wright has edited and published a series of six books, with writings by a large number of contemporary socialist scholars that explore what an alternative egalitarian, democratic society would look like, and how it would work.

The advantage of feasible socialism would be, that different ownership forms and allocation methods could be tried out, to see what works best for different types of activities. *Frank Furedi, the main ideological leader of an international ultra-left, post-Marxist libertarian grouping of radicals, has argued that \\"In these confused times, we should attempt to defend capitalism from its small-minded opponents\\" but also \\"rethink the categories and ideas through which we make sense of the human condition\\".Frank Furedi, \\"Capitalism after the 'credit crunch': what is it good for?\\". Spiked, 30 October 2008. Capitalism may be, for better or worse, all we have now, but that could still change. In a Promethean way, Furedi's group aims to look over the shoulder of the world's elites, the cognoscenti and the real experts, to appropriate the most advanced insights into human development, art, science, business and politics ‚Äì as a basis for understanding how ordinary people can really free themselves from oppression, tackle the horrors of modern society, assert authority, and powerfully accelerate the growth of human potential. *In her book Markets in the name of socialism, sociologist Johanna Bockman argues that \\"far from a hegemonic juggernaut, neoliberal capitalism was a parasitic growth on the very socialist alternatives it attacked\\".Johanna Bockman, Markets in the Name of Socialism: The Left-Wing Origins of Neoliberalism. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011, p. 1. *In their more recent research, the American socialists Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis look at the whole problem from a different angle: human beings cannot exist without social cooperation, as atomized individuals or isolated monads, so the dispute between capitalists and socialists really revolves around the methods of cooperation that work best for humanity.See e.g., Samuel Bowles & Herbert Gintis, A cooperative species: human reciprocity and its evolution. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011. Bowles believes that liberalism is in trouble, and could be coming to an end.Samuel Bowles, \\"The end of liberalism\\", in: The Boston Globe, 20 June 2017. *Last but not least, there are also \\"market anarchists\\" who believe in free markets but not in capitalism.Gary Chartier & Charles W. Johnson (eds.), Markets, not capitalism. Individualist anarchism against bosses, inequality, corporate power and structural poverty. New York: Autonomedia, 2011. All these argumentsSome of the historical Marxist debates in Europe are reviewed in Catherine Samary, Plan, Market and Democracy, IIRE Notebook for study and research 7/8, 1988. remain much in dispute among economists seeking economic reform; the debaters still cannot agree about basic concepts of economics, about the possible ways that production, trade and democracy can be combined, or about what factual evidence would finally clinch the controversy.Many of the important technical discussions in socialist or post-socialist societies have unfortunately never been translated into English, and the controversies are often strongly influenced by ideological, political or moral positions or cherished dogmas - rather than inspired by scientific principles. At a fundamental level, the theorists still cannot agree about what capitalism is, what socialism is, and how you get from the one to the other. Among other things, Marxists proposed a planned allocation of resources, without a coherent ethical framework for the evaluation of allocative priorities, and without much understanding of effective management. During the Cold War era, it was very difficult to pursue a scientific discussion about the issues, because positions were highly polarized. Strong moral sentiments and biases got in the way of objective analysis. Marxist discussion was dominated by the hegemonic Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology, because Marxist-Leninists had the most resources and political power. Either people were \\"for\\" or \\"against\\", and if they were on the \\"wrong\\" side, there was little scope for pursuing any objective inquiry (see also Culture during the Cold War). The effect of that was, that very little progress could be made with the scientific analysis of the transition to socialist society and the functioning of socialist society. In the cyber-age of the internet, a whole new language is emerging to conceptualize the battles people have with capitalist value relationsMassimo de Angelis, The beginning of history: value struggles and global capital. London: Pluto Press, 2007.‚Äîmeaning that often the old traditions do not speak clearly anymore to the new situation; their precise relevance is in dispute. With the growth of social media, what socialism means is no longer under the control of academics and political elites. For some, this is a good thing: they argue that the academics and the elites never got it correct anyway, only real workers did. For others, it is a bad thing: they argue that at least the academics and the elites had some rational, thought-through and coherent ideas about socialism.

Her doctoral thesis was one of the initial sources of pointless topology. She has also been active in the political left, lost one of her faculty positions over her protests of the Vietnam War, and became a founder of European Women in Mathematics. Mathematician Neil Hindman, with whom Strauss wrote a book on the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification of topological semigroups, has stated the following as advice for other mathematicians: \\"Find someone who is smarter than you are and get them to put your name on their papers\\", writing that for him, that someone was Dona Strauss. Education and career Strauss is originally from South Africa, the descendant of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Her father was a physicist at the University of Cape Town. She grew up in the Eastern Cape, and earned a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Cape Town. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1958. Her dissertation, Lattices of Functions, Measures, and Open Sets, was supervised by Frank Smithies. After completing her doctorate, she took a faculty position at the University of London. Following her husband's dream of living on a farm in Vermont, she moved to Dartmouth College in 1966. By 1972, she was working at the University of Hull and circa 2008 she became a professor at the University of Leeds. After retiring, she has been listed by Leeds as an honorary visiting fellow. Activism In South Africa, Strauss developed a strong antipathy to racial discrimination from a combination of being a Jew at the time of the Holocaust and her own observations of South African society. At the University of Cape Town, she became a member of the Non-European Unity Movement. After completing her degree, she left the country in protest over apartheid; her parents also left South Africa, after her father's retirement, for Israel. In the 1950s, she regularly published editorial works in Socialist Review, and in the 1960s she was active in Solidarity (UK). As an assistant professor at Dartmouth College in 1969, Strauss took part in a student anti- war protest that occupied Parkhurst Hall, the building that housed the college administration. In response, Dartmouth announced that Strauss and another faculty protester would not have their contracts renewed, and that they would be suspended from the faculty and \\"denied all rights and privileges of membership on the Dartmouth faculty\\", the first time in the college's history that it had taken this step. In 1986, Strauss became one of the five founders of European Women in Mathematics, together with Bodil Branner, Caroline Series, Gudrun Kalmbach, and Marie-Fran√ßoise Roy. Books Strauss is the co- author of: *Algebra in the Stone-ƒåech compactification: Theory and applications (with Neil Hindman, De Gruyter Expositions in Mathematics 27, Walter de Gruyter & Co., 1998; 2nd ed., 2012) *Banach algebras on semigroups and on their compactifications (with H. Garth Dales and Anthony T.-M. Lau, Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society 205, 2010) *Banach spaces of continuous functions as dual spaces (with H. Garth Dales, Frederick K. Dashiell Jr., and Anthony T.-M. Lau, CMS Books in Mathematics, Springer, 2016) Recognition In 2009 the University of Cambridge hosted a meeting, \\"Algebra and Analysis around the Stone-Cech Compactification\\", in honour of Strauss's 75th birthday. Personal life Strauss married (as the first of his four wives) Seymour Papert. Papert was also South African, and became a co-author and fellow student of Frank Smithies with Strauss at Cambridge. She met her second husband, Edmond Strauss, at the University of London. She is a strong amateur chess player, and was director of the Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue for 2014‚Äì2015.

Although best known for his works at the Schwerin Palace, most of his creations were in smaller formats, in the tradition of the .  Biography  He was the fourth of thirteen children born to the laborer, Franz Jakob Genschow and his wife. At the age of eleven, he suffered a severe, permanent injury to his left leg when he was scalded with liquid wax. An attempt at being a carpenter's apprentice had to be abandoned, as his leg could not stand the stress. In 1834, after having decided to pursue a career in art, a scholarship of 60 Thalers was approved by Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he was able to study drawing with Johann Friedrich Hesse (1792-1853). After his scholarship award was doubled, he went to study sculpture at the Berlin University of the Arts, where he worked with Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann (1836-1840) and Christian Daniel Rauch (1840-1842). Later he and several others worked as assistants to Rauch on his Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. After this, he established his own studio in Berlin-Kreuzberg. From 1838 to 1881, he was a regular exhibitor at the . From 1852 to 1857, he worked on a major commission he received through the intercession of the Director of the Grand Ducal Collections, . He created several statues for the new Schwerin Palace; notably an equestrian statue of the Medieval military leader, Niklot. From 1857 to 1866, he was employed by the . Until 1876, he received more orders from Grand Duke Frederick Francis II, who awarded him the Gold Cross of Merit of the House Order of the Wendish Crown in 1870, on the occasion of inaugurating the new main building at the University of Rostock, for which he had provided sculptures. In 1842, he had married Johanne Wilhelmine Ernestine Bohl (1822‚Äì1891), with whom he had four children. In 1874, continuing problems with his leg injury forced the amputation of his foot. He worked as a sculptor until 1885. After then, according to the Berlin address book, he apparently made his living as a landlord (). His grave at the has not been preserved.

Biography Henry Erskine Allon's father, Henry Allon, 1879. Henry Erskine Allon was born on 16 October 1864, to the prominent Nonconformist minister Henry Allon (1818‚Äì1892) and his wife, Eliza n√©e Goodman. Allon grew up among four sisters and two brothers, and was educated at Amersham Hall in Caversham, Reading. He attended University College, London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1882 and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1885. At Cambridge, he received an English essay prize, combined with a third in History. His father tried to get Allon appointed to the university's inspectorate, but was dissuaded by Matthew Arnold, as he suspected the Tory government in power (whose Lord President had the job of appointing inspectors) would not be happy to appoint nonconformist inspectors. Allon composed and published many musical works, including two cantatas, 'Annie of Lochroyan' and 'The Child of Elle' chamber music, piano solos, and cantatas, mainly for the pianoforte or the pianoforte with the violin. Clyde Binfield noted that while \\"there was nothing Celtic in his ancestry\\", his compositions often bore Scottish inspired names, such as 'The Maid of Colonsay' and 'May Margaret'. According to Edward Irving Carlyle, writing for the Dictionary of National Biography, his works \\"showed originality and power\\", and his brief biography in Alumni Cantabrigienses summed him up as \\"a musician of great promise\\". Binfield assessed him more bitterly, declaring \\"it was all promise, [as] he died in his early thirties\\". Allon studied music under William Henry Birch and Frederic Corder and was a vigorous promoter of, and contributor to, the New Musical Quarterly Review, which he had assisted in founding. Despite his father's strong nonconformist zeal, Allon lapsed from his father's faith. He instead became a member of CUNU, a Congregationalist and interdenominational religious organisation.

It is a carrier for encephalitic viruses including Venezuelan equine encephalitis and can transmit Dirofilaria immitis. It resides in the Americas and is known to bite mammals, reptiles, and birds. Like other mosquitoes, Ae. taeniorhynchus adults survive on a combination diet of blood and sugar, with females generally requiring a blood meal before laying eggs. This mosquito has been studied to investigate its development, physiological markers, and behavioral patterns, including periodic cycles for biting, flight, and swarming. This species is noted for developing in periodic cycles, with high sensitivity to light and flight patterns that result in specific wingbeat frequencies that allow for both species detection and sex distinction. Ae. taeniorhynchus is known to be a pest to humans and mechanisms for controlling Ae. taeniorhynchus populations have been developed. The United States has spent millions of dollars to control and contain Ae. taeniorhynchus.  Taxonomy  German entomologist Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann described Ae. (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus in 1821. Alternate namings for the species include Culex taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann, 1821), Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann, 1821), and Culex damnosus (Say 1823). Aedes niger, also known as Aedes portoricensis, is a subspecies of Ae. taeniorhynchus. It can be identified by its last posterior tarsal joint, which is mostly black rather than banded in white. It resides in Florida and can migrate as far as . Analysis of microsatellite data on the genes of Ae. taeniorhynchus living in the Galapagos Islands show genetic differentiation between coastal and highland mosquito populations. Data indicates minimal gene flow between the populations that only occurs during periods of heightened rainfall. Genetic differences suggest that habitat differences led to driving adaptation and divergence in the species, eventually leading to future speciation. Highland mosquitoes have population features characteristic of a founder effect due to low genetic diversity manifesting as low heterozygosity and low allelic richness, which may have resulted from egg dormancy during periods of dryness.  Description  Aedes taeniorhynchus adult wing Aedes taeniorhynchus adult proboscis Ae. taeniorhynchus adults are mostly black with areas of white banding. A single white band appears at the center of the proboscis, multiple white bands span the distal ends of the legs following the leg joints, and the last hind leg joints are completely colored white. Ae. taeniorhynchus wings are long and narrow with scaled wing veins. Experimental investigation of evolutionary coloration of Ae. taeniorhynchus yielded negative results. Mosquitoes reared in conditions of darkness, backgrounds colored black, white, or green, and lighting conditions of fluorescent light or sunlight, showed no color changes in the fat body nor in the head capsule, saddle, or siphon. This lack of cryptic coloring is suggested to be due to a lack of threat to the species; because the species habitat is a temporary water source used for larval growth, this temporary environment has few predators and relatively little danger. Males and females can be distinguished based on their antennae: males have plumose (feather-like) antennae while females antennae are sparsely haired. = Noise detection = Ae. taeniorhynchus swarms can be detected through sound. Noises with frequencies between 0.3-3.4 kHz at sound level 21 dB are detectable across 10‚Äì50 m in distance. An individual mosquito can be heard across 2‚Äì5 cm in distance when sound level rises to 22-25 dB. Male and female mosquitoes can also be distinguished by their wingbeat frequencies, which are 700‚Äì800 Hz for males and 400‚Äì500 Hz for females. As a result, flight sounds are used to determine flight activity and distinguish sex of groups. = Microbiome = Aedes mosquitoes have a characteristic microbiome that modulate the effects of diet. Microbiome makeup is reported to differ between males and females in Aedes mosquitoes, such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. Namely, in Aedes albopictus, males feed on nectar to acquire Actinobacteria while females contain Proteobacteria (such as Enterobacteriaceae) that mediate levels of redox stress caused by feeding on blood-meals. = Similar species = Aedes taeniorhynchus adult abdomen The main physical distinctions between Ae. taeniorhynchus and other species come from the white banding that covers several body parts along Ae. taeniorhynchus. The species, like other Aedes mosquitoes, exhibits basal banding of the abdomen, but Ae. taeniorhynchus also uniquely exhibits white-tipped palps and a central white ring on the proboscis. This species looks similar to Aedes sollicitans, except for subtle differences in the larval and adult stages. In the larval stage, Ae. taeniorhynchus has a shorter breathing tube, its scale patches are rounded instead of pointed at the tips, and spines that line the edges of each scale patch are smaller near the scale patch base. In the adult stage, Ae. taeniorhynchus is smaller and mostly black while Ae. sollicitans is golden brown. The species also bears similarity to Aedes jacobinae, which falls within the Taeniorhynchus subgenus due to its particular hypopygium structure, but it is considered a distinct species because it does not have leg markings. Similarly, this species can also be distinguished from Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian Tiger Mosquito, as Ae. taeniorhynchus, unlike Ae. albopictus, does not have markings on its back.  Distribution  Ae. taeniorhynchus is widely distributed across North and South America, though more highly concentrated in southern regions. At the time of the fly's initial discovery the species resided in coastal regions, and then gradually moved towards the interior of the Americas. Gene flow analysis derived from microsatellite data indicated that mosquitoes located in the Galapagos Island in the Pacific Island frequently migrate between islands on an isolation by distance basis. Incidence of ports was a strong factor contributing to migration, suggesting human-aided transport contributed to inter-island migration.  Habitat  Example of mangrove habitat Ae. taeniorhynchus resides in habitats with a temporary water source, making mangrove and salt marshes or other areas with moist soil popular locations for egg laying and immature growth. These habitats are highly variable but often have high salinity with an observed soluble salt content in soil of at least 1644 ppm. In the case of environmental conditions of dryness and low temperatures which are unfavorable for egg hatching, eggs can remain dormant for years. Factors controlling the scale of A. taeniorhynchus growth during pre-emergence depend on environmental conditions matching moisture level and temperature. In Southern Florida, the main factors are tide height and amount of rainfall, while sites in California rely on tide height alone. In Virginia, these factors are limited to levels of rainfall and temperature. Generally favorable factors can turn negative at extreme values, causing survival rate to decline. Excess water washes mosquito eggs away and extremely high temperatures can lead to water source evaporation. This species exhibits sensitivity to temperature, with differences found for constant, split, and alternating temperatures. At constant temperatures of 22, 27, and 32 ¬∞C, life span increased with temperature, but at split temperatures, mosquitoes were also split between life and death. At different temperatures, the rate of aging was independent in males, but higher for females living at 22 and 27 ¬∞C. At alternating temperatures, life spans were temperature independent for all sexes and temperatures, except for favoring of alternation between 22 and 27 ¬∞C by females. Mating sites for Aedes taeniorhynchus are often in contact with Distichlis spicata Breeding locations for Ae. taeniorhynchus are often in contact with vegetation such as Distichlis spicata (spike grass) and Spartina patens (salt meadow hay) in grass salt marshes and Batis maritima (saltwort) and species from the Salicornia genus (glassworts) in mangroves. This species of mosquito is found in close proximity to other mosquitoes that reside in marches. These include Aedes sollicitans (eastern salt marsh mosquito), Anopheles bradleyi, and A. atropos.  Life history  According to observational field studies, Ae. taeniorhynchus carries out several behavioral trends at different stages of life. Growth and pupation of this species were found to be affected by environmental factors of nutrition, population density, salinity, light-dark, and temperature. = Eggs = Females lay eggs on dry ground, and egg hatching is triggered by the presence of water, such as rain or flooding. Egg laying yield from females, an indicator of fecundity, differs based on diet: in populations of low autogeny, rare autogenous females each laid less than 30 eggs, while egg yield was significantly higher in populations with majority autogenous females. Eggs laid in the right temperature and humidity conditions undergo embryogenesis, then stay dormant until hatching. = Larval in-stars = Upon hatching, the species progresses through 4 larval instars: the first 3 instars are affected primarily by temperature, with minor effects by salinity; the fourth instar is affected by all environmental factors. In the fourth instar, increased food sped up development time while crowding and salinity stunted growth. Preferred temperature for all 4 instars is between 30 ¬∞C and 38 ¬∞C but average preferred temperature increases with age. The first instar prefers an average temperature of 31.8 ¬∞C and the early fourth instar prefers a temperature of 34.6¬∞. The late fourth instar, however, has a lower preferred temperature than the early fourth instar, at 33.0¬∞. Starved larvae were found to have a wider preferred temperature range that is centered around lower temperatures. Laboratory larval colonies cultured for years 27.0 ¬∞C were found to prefer consistently lower temperatures. Fourth-instar larvae were noted to drink sea water (100 nL/h) and secrete hyperosmotic fluid through the rectum. This fluid is similar to seawater but with 18-fold higher potassium levels. Because the secreted fluid does not allow for osmotic balance with the ingested fluid, studies suggest that the anal papillae aid in salt secretion. = Pupa = All environmental factors affect pupation regarding the insect's diurnal rhythm, which has a period of 21.5 hours. Factors leading to an increased pupa period include erase of light-dark cycles with all dark or all light conditions, increased salinity, and crowding. These trends continued to adhere to a preference for temperatures close to 27 ¬∞C or 32 ¬∞C. Pupa also exhibit differential aggregation formation due to these environmental factors. Cluster type aggregations form alongside temporary crowding and excess of food while ball type aggregations may manifest out of temporary crowding but lack of food. At lower constant temperatures of 22 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C, cluster type aggregations may form but higher temperatures of 30¬∞ and 32 ¬∞C inhibit aggregation formation. Aggregations produced pupa with slightly heavier dry body weights and promoted developmental synchronization in ecdysis and greater likelihood of migration at emergence. = Adult stages = Males and females mosquitoes emerge from their egg sites in similar ways. They remain in their sources of water for 12-24 hours. Adults then migrate away from the egg laying ground over the course of 1‚Äì4 days. Different sexes exhibit differential migration, with most females traveling at least , and most males traveling no farther than . Female migration follows a random pattern with no limitation on migration direction and migration occurring along a 5-day cycle. Males initially travel with females until they hit a stopping point, where they replace migration with swarming. Flight patterns become established in the adult stage and are not affected by behavioral patterns from earlier stages of life. Adults begin biting at day 4 and follow a 5-day cycle until death. Between the sexes, peak biting intensity occurs in females at ages 4, 9, and 14 days. Adult female mosquitoes continue living and laying eggs for 3‚Äì4 weeks before dying. Those that survive longer continue to bite but stop laying eggs.  Food resources  = Blood = Adult female Aedes taeniorhynchus Ae. taeniorhynchus eggs can mature both autogenously and anautogenously, with autogenous eggs feeding on sugar and anautogenous eggs requiring a blood meal. These food sources promote maturation by producing hormones from the corpora allata (CA) and medial neurosecretory cell perikarya (MNCA), of which only MNCA hormone release is responsible for anautogenous maturation. Larval dependence on a blood meal can be influenced to make mosquitoes less autogenous, by not allowing females to feed on sugar and imposing other dietary changes. Aedes taeniorhynchus is an ectoparasite of waved albatrosses Adult mosquitoes feed on a combination diet of blood and sugar, with the optimal diet consisting of sugar for males and both blood and sugar for females. Most Ae. taeniorhynchus rely on mammals and birds for blood meals, especially depending on bovine, rabbits, and armadillos. Mosquitoes in the Galapagos Islands feed on mammals and reptiles, with equal preference but feed little on birds. Since this differs from the typical feeding of Ae. taeniorhynchus on birds, studies suggest the species is an opportunistic feeder, in which it feeds more on the most readily available, easily accessible organisms. Ae. taeniorhynchus acts as an ectoparasite to Diomedea irrorata, known as waved albatrosses. Mosquitoes bite the waved albatrosses, directly leading to or transmitting diseases that cause nestling mortality, colony migration, or egg desertion in albatrosses. Experimental studies show that both sexes can survive on a sugar-only diet for 2‚Äì3 months, but females require blood meals for egg production. In females, supplementation of a blood meal in autogenous mosquitoes increased both egg production and lifespan. Additional observational studies of Ae. taeniorhynchus in nature showed that habitat impacts the effect of the meal source: females inhabiting mangrove swamps could produce eggs even without blood meals, but those from a grassy salt marsh environment could not. Females from both habitats, however, were still able to produce eggs when given blood meals. = Sugar = Studies observing unrestricted sugar intake of females correlated sucrose intake level with maximum accumulation of stored energy reserves. In contrast, sucrose intake level does not correlate with decreased activity or changes in senescence. Carbohydrate feedings of female mosquitoes in a laboratory setting indicated that carbohydrates glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, trehalose, melibiose, maltose, raffinose, melizitose, dextrin, mannitol, and sorbitol are most effective to aid survival; arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, sorbose, lactose, cellobiose, inulin, a-methyl mannoside, dulcitol, and inositol are not used by the species; xylose, glycogen, a-methyl glucoside, and glycerol are used but at a slow metabolic rate; and sorbose could not be metabolized. Feeding with glucose allowed for maximum flight speed while other carbohydrates, such as all pentoses, sorbose, lactose, cellobiose, glycogen, inulin, a-methyl mannoside, dulcitol, and inositol were insufficient to allow flight, indicated by a delay in flight after feeding. = Nectar = If emergence occurs at a location with flowers, both sexes feed on nectar prior to migration. Analysis of fructose and glycogen content indicate that mosquitoes often feed on nectar soon after dark and feed sparingly on nectar during the day. Behavior =Mating= Males become sexually mature about 2 days after emergence, and females become sexually mature at an age of 12 days, with plans to mate only once. Observational studies of mating interactions both in a laboratory setting and field setting noted copulation between mosquitoes occurring after sunset. Results noted that copulation depends on age of females, with insemination occurring with females of ages 30‚Äì40 hours. In both settings studied, females are capable of mating without inducing insemination, as only 1% of females contained sperm after 2 notes of potential mating. Mating not only provides an opportunity for insemination but also contributes to vitellogenin synthesis in females, as experimental injections of male accessory gland fluid (MAGF) has been shown to cause release of corpus cardiacum (CC) stimulating factor in the ovaries, which spurs research of egg development neurosecretory hormone (EDNH). Other laboratory studies of the species noted an age dependence in both females and males for successful copulation and insemination. Copulation is initiated by males and only occurs when the male first disengages its legs, interlocks the male and female genitalia in an end-to-end position, and then hangs from the female for a short duration of time. Insemination can only result from copulation. If copulation is successful, the mosquitoes pair in flight, then land and remain together for a few seconds. To end copulation, the male flies away or the female flies while carrying the male until it falls. Most young females rejected copulation attempts (unreceptive), and many of those that copulated rejected insemination attempts (refractory), with acceptance of copulation and insemination (receptive) both increasing with female age when exposed to an older male cohort. Unreceptive females avoided males by flying away with sudden increases in speed or sharp turns. During mating, males can transfer substances produced from their accessory glands that affect female physiology and behavior. These accessory gland substances can limit or improve female reproductive activities. Limitations include temporarily prevention of future female mating, oviposition stimulation, and reduced host-seeking while improvements involve changes to female circadian rhythm and metabolic priorities that cause higher chance of reproduction. =Parental care= Females are known to practice oviposition, with preference for high moisture soils, with water saturation greater than 70%. Female clutch sizes are 100-200 eggs, with at least one clutch laid per female. In experimental studies with ovariectomized female mosquitoes, females were unable to synthesize vitellogenin, a yolk-protein precursor, unless given a donor ovary from a sugar-fed or blood-fed mosquito. Vitellogenin synthesis still occurred when the donor ovary came from Ae. aegypti, and ovary derivation from a blood-fed mosquito caused corpus cardiacum stimulating factor production, indicating that the hormonal processes for oviposition are not species specific. In a study of eggs laid in Rhizophora mangle L. (red mangrove) and Avicennia germinans L. (black mangrove) forest basins, egg occurrence was correlated with elevation and detritus level. Oviposition was directed from black mangrove basins to red mangrove basins, possibly due to reduced detritus and reduced organic content in the soil caused by black mangrove grazing by Melampus coffeus L., a snail. Because eggshells and eggs share the same habitat, it is suggested that oviposition may be delineated using eggshells. Eggshell sampling analysis from 34 mangrove forest sites indicated that all mangrove basin forests can yield successful Ae. taeniorhynchus production, regardless of forest geomorphology, soil, and vegetation but recently flooded sites are most optimal. Additionally, sulfates and other salts were deemed favorable to ovipositing females in a laboratory setting but sulfate concentrations in the field may be too low for this effect to be significant. Substrate texture was also determined to be a factor contributing to oviposition, with studies of egg laying on sand particle size indicating a preference for sand particles sized from 0.33-0.62 mm. = Flight cycles = Adult female mosquitoes ready to lay eggs differ from other adult females in many important behaviors. They perform a special flight at ages 7, 12, and 17, following a 5-day cycle. Changes in diet have effects on flight in males sand females: males fed sugar alone exhibited changes in flight patterns that resembled cyclic swarming, females fed sugar alone exhibited consistent flight patterns consisting of a 4-week cycle of flight 40 minutes during dark and 20 minutes during light, females fed sugar and blood experienced reduced flight after 2 weeks, and females fed blood alone flew no more than 10 days. Starved females later fed blood stayed sedentary for 8 hours before returning to flight. Flights are occur with the purpose of acquiring nectar, with flight distance depending on wind speed, direction, landscape, and nectar availability. Females typically fly 2‚Äì5 miles in search of nectar, but flights ranging 30 miles have been recorded as a result of other flight factors. Adults searching for a blood meal may also fly up to 25 miles. Flight patterns are these mosquitoes are closely related to light sensitivity, as flight patterns increase with strength of moonlight: females increase flight activity from 95% at quarter moon to 546% at full moon. Male and female adult mosquitoes are repelled by light, allowing mosquitoes to be caught with light traps. However, females ready to lay eggs to not exhibit this behavior. In an experimental setting, mosquitoes raised under conditions of 12 hr light : 12 hr dark were found to exhibit flight activity at both light-off and light-on periods in a bimodal alternans pattern. Mosquitoes adjusted to new light conditions within 24‚Äì36 hours, in which a delayed light-off resets the pattern but an early light-off does not. Adult males begin forming top-swarms beginning at an age of 4 days and lasting until 2‚Äì3 weeks of age. These swarms form every evening and morning at a fixed location and time and last for a maximum of 30 minutes. In field observations of Ae. taeniorhynchus in Florida, morning and evening swarms were typically halfway finished by the time point of 4 minutes before and after twilight, respectively. The initial stimulus for swarming behavior is unknown, but time spent swarming depends on sensitivity of individual males to the swarming driving force and swarm size, with small swarms lasting for 12 minutes and large swarms lasting for 27 minutes. These swarms are characterized as transient passage swarms, where males participate in the swarm for 1.5 minutes at a time rather than the full-time. Despite the act of males forming top-swarms, mating has not been observed to coincide with swarming. Parasites Parasites of this species include Amblyospora polykarya, a species of Microspora that lasts for a single generation on Ae. taeniorhynchus, and Goelomomyces psorophorae, a fungus impacting mosquito ovaries that stops egg maturity and kills all larvae. Blood meal analysis and PCR-based parasite screening of mosquitoes in the Galapagos Islands suggested relationships between the species and Hepatozoon parasites infecting reptiles in the area. The occurrence of a mixed Hepatozoon population in the reptile host suggests that Ae. taeniorhynchus caused a breakdown of the host-species relationship between some Heptazoon parasties and native reptiles. In a topological analysis of parasitism in the food web, Ae. taeniorhynchus, along with Culex tarsalis, was found the most significant organisms within a predator-parasite sub-web, meaning they have the most food web connections among organisms mapped. Disease transmission West Nile Virus Ae. taeniorhynchus is a carrier for West Nile Virus, mosquito iridescent virus, the eastern and western type of equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Experimental studies also established that the species is capable of mechanical transmission of Bacillus anthracis. Experimental studies regarding Rift Valley fever virus showed that infectivity is independent of temperature, but viral dissemination and transmission is faster at higher temperatures. This species can transmit Dirofilaria immitis, a filarial worm that can can cause heartworm in dogs. Infection by D. immitis occurs through parasite establishment in the Ae. taeniorhynchus Malpighian tubules in a process that changes the microvillar border to impede fluid transport. The parasite takes up to 48 hrs to establish itself in its host; establishment may not occur if the host is resistant. This parasite was also seen to spread to flightless cormorants in the Galapagos, with gene flow analysis correlating parasitic infection with Ae. taeniorhynchus migration patterns and suggesting that Ae. taeniorhynchus is the likely vector for transmission.  Interactions with humans  This species of mosquito is considered a pest among humans, with Florida districts attempting to control the mosquitoes since 1927 and having spent US$1.5 million on insect control in 1951. Copper acetoarsenite, known as Paris green, is used as an insecticide for Ae. taeniorhynchus larvae at the species breeding site, since the substance acts as a toxic stomach poison. DDT, another insecticide, was also deemed to be effective against the salt marsh mosquitoes and has been used for Ae. taeniorhynchus treatment in the past. Trap-bait combinations tested against the species indicate that CDC-type traps with carbon dioxide, octenol, and heat as bait increase the trapping success of Ae. taeniorhynchus. Humans have also tried to limit biting from Ae. taeniorhynchus because it flies very fast, and they start the blood extraction quickly, compared to the average mosquito, by wearing chemically treated protective clothing. Clothing treated with permethrin [(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl (¬±) cis/trans 3-(2-dichloroethenyl)2, 2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate] alongside application of deet (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) to the skin were shown to be extremely effective in reducing mosquito bites compared to usage of only one form of protection or no protection. The Off! Clip-on Mosquito Repellent device, which releases pyrethroid insecticide metofluthrin in vapor form, was also evaluated against Ae. taeniorhynchus in two Florida field location and was found to provide 79% protection from mosquito bites for 3 hrs. Other toxins have been identified against Ae. taeniorhynchus. Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (HD-1) can produce a parasporal crystal in the form of a toxic inclusion body. Proteins isolated from a parasporal crystal, yielded two distinct proteins of types k-1 and k-73, of which only k-1, a 65 kD protein, was found to be toxic to Ae. taeniorhynchus larvae.

It was named in honour of Ian Sainthouse, a \\"renowned breeder and collector of killifish, for his special longstanding dedication to researches on the genus Nothobranchius\\". Description and habitat Males grow up to about 41 millimetres of standard length (i.e. body length excluding caudal fin) and females circa 30 mm. The species is an annual killifish. They inhabit ephemeral pools filled by rainwater during the monsoon season, being adapted to the alteration of dry and wet seasons. As with all members of the genus Nothobranchius, they show extreme life-history adaptations: their embryos survive by entering a three to four month long diapause, within eggs that have a very hard chorion and are resistant to desiccation and hypoxia. When their habitats dry up during the dry season all adult fish die, and the species then survive solely due to the eggs laying dormant, encased in clay. Type locality and type material The type locality is listed as \\"Seasonal pools on floodplain of small seasonal Chimbembe River, about 5 km southwest from influx of Luongo into Luapula, near Mweshi village, Luapula Province, Zambia, 10¬∞43.51'S, 28¬∞38.22'E\\". The holotype is a 32.9 mm long male specimen preserved at the Royal Museum for Central Africa, filed under the ID \\"MRAC B5-027-P-0001\\".

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Location The N√©tagamiou River flows through the unorganized territory of Petit-M√©catina. It flows south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence along the line that separates the cantons of Bellecourt and Saint-Vincent. The mouth is in the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent in Le Golfe-du-Saint- Laurent Regional County Municipality. The mouth is about east of the Innu reserve of La Romaine. It is east of the village of Chevery, which is built on a point of sand and is accessible by boat from Harrington Harbour. The watershed covers . The river forms north, where it branches out from the Petit M√©catina River. The mouth is blocked by a sandbar, through which it cuts a narrow channel deep. Within the sandbar there is a natural harbor. Boats can travel upstream as far as the first falls, which are high. The falls can be reached by a footpath that runs along the first of the river. Name The name was spelled Nato√ºacamiou in the 17th century. It was spelled Nontagamion in a 1740 document. The name was written as Natagamiou in the 19th century and Nokatamu in the early 20th century. The name may come from the Innu language term n√©tagamiou meaning \\"river that goes underground\\", or may come from natuakamiu\\" meaning \\"river widens to form a large pool of calm water\\". The Petit M√©catina Archipelago is a group of islands southeast of the river mouth. The Innu use the name Atauakanaih Hipu for the river, meaning \\"lake invaded by water from another lake or river\\". Early European presence In 1734 Jacques de Lafontaine de Belcour gained a valuable concession from the governor of New France, Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, and the intendant Gilles Hocquart. This was a monopoly for nine years on the Indian trade and seal fishery between the mouths of the √âtamamiou and N√©tagamiou rivers. He established a fur-trading and seal-fishing post near today's Chevery, at the mouth of the N√©tagamiou River. From 1737 Fran√ßois Perrault operated the N√©tagamiou River post in Labrador in association with Lafontaine. In 1740, Fran√ßois Perrault, his son Jacques Perrault and Charles Levreau, took a lease on the N√©tagamiou post. The Poste-de-N√©tagamiou is now an archaeological site. Seals were used for their skin, meat and oil, which was used for lighting. They were trapped by nets stretched across channels along the coast that they followed in their migration south in the fall. Traces remain of holes drilled in the rocks to hold anchors for the nets. The site also holds the master's house and those of the employees, the store, warehouse and facilities for melting seal oil. In the early days several thousand seals were taken each year. The catch declined in later years, but continued after Lafontaine's bankruptcy in 1754 and after the English took over, lasting until the end of the 19th century. Fishing Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) may be caught on the N√©tagamiou. There are no reports of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) catches between 1984 and 2017. In 2017 all salmon, large and small, had to be released on the Malbaie (Gasp√© Peninsula), Pigou, Bouleau, Magpie, Coacoachou, N√©tagamiou, Little Mecatina and V√©co rivers. Only young salmon could be retained on 51 rivers, and limited retention of large salmon was allowed on 19 rivers.

Porter converted Greenwich to a storeship and placed her under the command of Lt. John M. Gamble, of the United States Marine Corps. Greenwich cruised with Essex off South America until 3 October 1813 when the ships departed for the Marquesas Islands for overhaul and provisioning. Upon his arrival in the Marquesas, Porter erected a fort on what he called Madison Island, and before leaving for Chile 12 December placed prizes Greenwich, , and under the protection of its guns. Soon after Porter's departure, Gamble, who was left in charge, was forced to land a detachment to quiet a threat from the local inhabitants. Lieutenant Gamble, despairing of Porter's return, began to prepare for departure from the islands in April 1814 by rigging Seringapatam and Sir Andrew Hammond for sea. Evidence of an impending mutiny was discovered, and although Gamble transferred all ammunition to Greenwich as a precaution, the mutineers attacked and captured Seringapatam on 7 May 1814, wounding Gamble. Two days later Gamble attempted to get Sir Andrew Hammond to sea, but was attacked again, losing four of his men. His entire party now reduced to eight men, only four of whom were fit for duty, Gamble finally put to sea in Sir Andrew Hammond. Before he left he set fire to Greenwich.

The station was owned by the Eastern Broadcasting Corporation. History WACH-TV was the third television station to sign on in Hampton Roads, debuting on October 13, 1953. Operating as a sister station to WHYU radio (1270 kHz), it broadcast from the tallest structure in the Lower Peninsula, its tower at 114 24th Street in downtown. Its schedule consisted mainly of sports and mystery shows, with five hours a day of programs such as Crusader Rabbit, All American Football and Ringside with Rasslers. Before even going on the air, the new TV station had made waves in Washington when it lobbied for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the television networks, saying that the lone VHF station in Hampton Roads, WTAR-TV, was \\"hogging\\" all three network hookups. (A month before WACH signed on, WVEC-TV had taken to the air on channel 15 and became the area's NBC affiliate.) The day that WACH-TV suspended operations‚ÄîMarch 27, 1954‚ÄîWHYU radio took on the WACH call letters. The night before, its schedule had consisted of just four programs repeated in a loop: a newscast, Crusader Rabbit, Short Subjects, and Hornliegh on Holiday. =Brief return to the air= In August 1954, WACH-TV returned to the air, simulcasting the associated radio station; it was the first time a UHF station that had suspended operations for economic reasons proceeded to resume telecasting. The station ended operation around July 1, 1955. Citing economic losses, the owners of WACH-TV asked the FCC to assign all future VHF channels in Hampton Roads for educational use only, which would have left just one commercial station (WTAR-TV) on VHF. By this time, the comparative proceeding for channel 10 was in progress; several months prior, in April, the station told the FCC that network affiliations in the area were unsettled pending action in the channel 10 hearings. Eastern's venture into television resulted in a bankruptcy that, on February 1, 1956, forced the temporary suspension of operations for WACH radio. The WACH radio license and TV construction permit were sold to Richard Eaton's United Broadcasting later that year; the TV station construction permit, which remained in force, briefly took on the WYOU-TV call letters concurrent with the change of the radio station from WACH to WYOU. Eaton held on to the TV permit past the 1960 sale of WYOU; in November 1964, the FCC notified 29 permittees, including Eaton, that they had to put their dark UHF stations on the air. Channel 33 in the region would not be revived until WTVZ began telecasting on September 24, 1979, more than 24 years after WACH-TV's final broadcast. The WACH callsign is now used by the Fox affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina.

An estrangeirado, Verney is sometimes called the most important figure of the Portuguese Enlightenment. Most notably, Verney advocated a plan to completely reform the educational system in Portugal, in radical opposition to the methods employed at the time by the Jesuits, who had long had a near-monopoly on teaching in the country; his controversial manifesto, Verdadeiro M√©todo de Estudar (first published anonymously in 1746), would later serve as the basis for many of the educational reforms instituted under the Marquis of Pombal. Biography Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio Verney was born in Lisbon in 1713, the son of Denys Verney (1650 ‚Äì c. 1734), from Saint-Cl√©ment-les-Places in Lyon, France, and Maria da Concei√ß√£o Arnaut, from the parish of Santa Euf√©mia in the town of Penela, Coimbra. The family of wealthy merchants was established in Rua Nova do Almada, where they owned a drugstore. One of 10 siblings (4 boys and 6 girls ‚Äî through one of which Verney was to be Jo√£o Frederico Ludovice's brother-in-law), Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio was baptized on 6 August of that year, in the Church of Saint Julian. He was first tutored by the family's chaplain, Fr. Manuel de Aguiar Paix√£o, at the age of six, in his first studies of Latin Grammar, Spanish, French, and Italian. He studied in the Jesuit College of Saint Antony the Abbot, probably between 1720 and 1727, and from then till 1729, Philosophy with the Oratorians, at the Convent of the Holy Spirit of the Quarry (Esp√≠rito Santo da Pedreira). In April 1729, Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio Verney interrupted his studies to enlist as a volunteer in a military expedition in Portuguese India; for unknown reasons, however, he seems to have had a change of heart ‚Äî by November of that year, he enrolled in the Jesuit-run University of √âvora, from which he concluded his studies in Philosophy and Theology, achieving the degree of Artium Magister in 1736. Afterwards, Verney travelled to Rome to earn a doctorate in Theology and Law in the Sapienza University of Rome. There, he became a member of the Academy of the Arcadians, and corresponded with important figures of the Italian Enlightenment, such as leading encyclopedist Ludovico Antonio Muratori, and Antonio Genovesi. In 1741, he was appointed Archdeacon of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of √âvora. National Library of Naples It was around this time that Verney conceived his plan to reform the educational system in Portugal, to bring it closer to the winds of cultural progress that permeated the spirits of progressive Europe. His Verdadeiro M√©todo de Estudar, setting out in summary form his harsh criticism of the existing system and his proposals for changing it, was initially published anonymously in 1746: it soon became the focus of much controversy, which made Verney lose much needed influence at the court of King John V. In Verdadeiro M√©todo de Estudar, Verney argued that grammar should be taught in Portuguese, not Latin, and staunchly defended experimental methods, as opposed to a system of argumentation based on authority, calling into question the influence of the Society of Jesus, who held a near-monopoly of higher education in the country; Verney also approached (without necessarily adopting) some of the principles of the Jansenists and Gallicans in relation to the methods used in theological studies. The book prompted a furious polemic: between its first publication and 1757, over forty books were written in response to Verney's manifesto. Verney's standing with the political elites grew stronger with the rise of the chief minister of King Joseph I, the Marquis of Pombal, he himself an estrangeirado. Following the national suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1759, Pombal's subsequent reforms saw many of Verney's ideas implemented into the Portuguese educational system. Verney himself was appointed, in April 1768, secretary of the Portuguese Legation in Rome; however, Verney's envolvement in political issues resulted in his fall from grace and dismissal in 1771. He lived in exhile in San Miniato until his rehabilitation following the death of King Joseph I and the accession of Queen Maria I in 1777. In 1780, he became a correspondent of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences in Rome and, in 1790, was named an honorary member of the Board of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consci√™ncia e Ordens). Old and sick, Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio Verney died in Rome in March 1792, after spending eight days in a coma. He was already blind and ailing on 18 August 1791, when he dictated his will.

Price is a Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience and Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London. Her overarching research goal is to provide a model of the neural basis of language that predicts and explains speech and language difficulties and their recovery after brain damage (stroke or neurosurgery). She is a world-leading, renowned neuroscientist. Price is also Director of the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging. Education Price obtained her bachelor's degree in 1984, and her PhD in 1990, both from Birkbeck College. Professor Kia Nobre, who nominated Price for the 5th Suffrage award for Life Sciences, said: \\"She blossomed through the trenches of a very macho world with gentle words, generous deeds, scientific commitment and rigour, genuine translation of research to clinical benefit, and humour.\\" Price originally trained as a neuropsychologist studying reading and object recognition in patients with brain damage. In 1991, she joined the Medical Research Council (MRC) cyclotron unit at the inception of human brain mapping and used PET scanning to provide new insights into the functional anatomy of reading, speech perception, speech production and semantics. Research and career In 1995, Price moved to University College London using MRI scanning to show how language abilities and IQ are reflected in brain structure. For example, by combining structural and functional imaging data from healthy participants, Price has shown the remarkable effect that learning has on the structure of the brain. This is illustrated in a series of 3 Nature papers that map structural brain changes associated with (i) learning a second language, (ii) learning to read in adulthood and (iii) naturally occurring changes in verbal and nonverbal IQ in the teenage brain. Price has made two strong theoretical claims. Contrary to traditional views, her ‚Äúcognitive ontologies‚Äù theory claimed that there are no parts of the human brain that are dedicated to language processing. Instead, specialisation for all types of language processing emerge through cross-talk among unique combinations of areas that are each involved in many other non- linguistic functions. Redefining the functional components of language, in terms of the underlying neural systems would, Price proposes, allow us to generate cognitive models that are both physiologically plausible and clinically useful. Her ‚Äúcognitive degeneracy‚Äù theory claimed that the same language task can be supported by different neural pathways, and that an understanding of when and why different neural pathways are used is essential for understanding how patients recover language after brain damage. Since 2012, Price has turned her attention to developing a tool for predicting language outcome and recovery after stroke (the PLORAS study). To this end, she is creating a database that provides easy access to multiple sources of information (behaviour, demographics, brain structure and function) from thousands of stroke survivors. Predictions for new patients are based on how others with similar brain damage and demographics were observed to recover from the same symptoms. The same data, and the theory of cognitive degeneracy, can also be used to explain recovery in terms of the degree to which patients have preserved the set of neural pathways needed to produce speech and language (Seghier and Price, 2018). In March 2020, her h-index is 86 from a total of 322 papers, with more than 24,000 citations.

Background Winitz received his MA and Ph.D. in the areas of child language, speech language pathology, and psychology from the University of Iowa. Contribution He is best known as one of the chief developers of the comprehension method of language learning along with James Asher, Tracy Terrell and Stephen Krashen. The comprehension approach is based on observations of first language acquisition by infants and children: 1) A silent period when only hearing and observation are used for language input; no production (other than babbling for mouth and tongue training. 2) Children acquire their first language by observing and comprehending the language addressed to them as part of their daily activities. 3) The daily activities take the form of scripts in which words and grammatical units are presented to reflect cognitive representations of language grammars, such as present, past, and future time, plurality, direct and indirect object, etc. 4) Parents talk to young children in short sentences using concrete terms and show the meaning of words by pointing to objects and defining events through imitation and actions. 5) Children hear over 15 million sentences by age 5 when the underlying formulations of their language are acquired. Winitz developed the Comprehension Approach by using the above principles (and others) adapted for the adult language learner. 1) Students remain silent through a course of instruction that can last two or three years. 2) They do not learn explicit grammatical principles and they do not practice sentences in drills. 3) They acquire the meaning of words by looking at carefully presented pictures according to a language script that begins with short sentences and simple cognitive and language concepts. 4) The language sentences are presented by computer during which students hear thousands of sentences over relatively brief periods of time. 5) They do not hear other students' sentences which usually are said incorrectly with inaccurate pronunciation patterns. 6) An extensive vocabulary is taught through the use of word fields. For example, when learning the word \\"big\\", they also acquire the many words in the second language for the word field big, such as enormous,wide, spacious, extend, giant, etc. All are presented in pictorial format and as part of a particular script Research Many of the principles have been tested in research studies and classrooms. In 1975, he pioneered the use of computers for both development and testing. He is a proponent of the avoidance of drills. In contrast to received wisdom, he found that teaching vocabulary by theme (all names of fruits for example) causes confusion. Vocabulary should be thematically unrelated. Reviews of the theory and practice of the Comprehension Approach by Judith and Norman Gary are to be found in {{Winitz, H.

It is situated immediately north of Rockport State Park and the North Cascades Highway, on land managed by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Sauk Mountain is positioned west of the crest of the North Cascades Range, approximately nine miles east of Concrete, Washington, and 17 miles north of the town of Darrington. Its nearest higher peak is Helen Buttes, to the northeast. A popular two-mile trail provides hikers with good views from the craggy summit of Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan, Mount Chaval, and the Picket Range. The mountain's name \\"Sauk\\" comes from its position immediately north of the confluence of the Sauk River with the Skagit River, which in turn comes from the Sah-kee-ma-hu (Sauk-Suiattle tribe), a group related to the Skagit tribes. Precipitation runoff from Sauk Mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate One of Sauk's summits Sauk Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Narda quickly strengthened, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) that day before making a second landfall along the northwestern coast of Mexico. The tropical cyclone weakened rapidly as it moved along the coastline, and it weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating just off the coast of Sonora on October 1. Meteorological history On September 23, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for an area of low pressure to form south of the southern coast of Mexico over that coming weekend. A broad and elongated trough of low pressure developed near the coast of Central America on September 26, and a broad area of low pressure developed along this trough two days later south-southeast of Acapulco. The disturbance continued to gradually become better organized through the following day, and although it still lacked a well-defined center of circulation, the threat of tropical storm-force winds along the southwestern coast of Mexico prompted the initiation of advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E at 15:00 UTC on September 28. Early on the following day, the disturbance's circulation became better defined, and an increase in convective banding occurred over the western portion of the broad system. As a result, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Narda at 03:00 UTC on September 29. Moving slowly northward toward the southern coast of Mexico, Narda gradually became better organized and strengthened to an initial peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) as banding features became evident. However, later that day, satellite imagery and radar data from coastal stations in Mexico indicated that the center of Narda relocated further north and close to the coast of Mexico near Zihuatanejo. As it moved inland, Narda quickly became less organized, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC as the center moved over the mountains of southwestern Mexico. Narda emerged over the eastern Pacific Ocean early on September 30 near the Islas Mar√≠as as a poorly-organized tropical depression. However, the cyclone continued to produce a large area of deep convection near and west of its center, and it soon restrengthened into a tropical storm at 15:00 UTC that day. Throughout the day, Narda continued to become better organized as it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf of California. Microwave imagery revealed the presence of well-defined banding features and a mid-level eye feature located just off the Mexican coast, and Narda reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 21:00 UTC on September 30. Six hours later, Narda made its second landfall along the northwestern coast of Mexico near Topolobampo as a slightly weaker cyclone with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Narda continued to weaken as it hugged the northwestern coast of Mexico, and by 12:00 UTC on October 1 it had weakened to a tropical depression while just off the coast. The cyclone continued to rapidly weaken, and three hours later, Narda dissipated near the northwestern coast of Mexico. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Narda near the southern coast of Mexico on September 29 Upon the initiation of advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen-E on September 28, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning along the southwestern coast of Mexico from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes. These warnings were discontinued at 21:00 UTC on September 29 after Narda had moved inland and weakened. However, six hours later, tropical storm warnings were again issued, this time for the northwestern coast of Mexico from San Blas to Topolobampo, while a tropical storm watch was also issued northward to Guaymas. The watch was upgraded to a warning at 15:00 UTC on September 30 as Narda approached the coast. All warnings were discontinued on October 1 after Narda had once again weakened to a tropical depression. Remaining near the coast of western Mexico for three days, Narda produced heavy rainfall that triggered flash flooding and mudslides across much of western Mexico. In Oaxaca, two deaths occurred as a result of the storm: a 26-year-old man died after he was dragged by strong river currents in San Pedro Mixtepec, Miahuatl√°n, and a 17-year-old boy drowned after he was dragged by strong currents along the San Crist√≥bal River in the community of San Jer√≥nimo Coatl√°n, Sierra Sur de Oaxaca. In the Tecom√°n Municipality, Colima, a 29-year-old man died after he was dragged away by strong currents while fishing on his boat in the Alcuzahue Lagoon. In the municipality of Malinaltepec, Guerrero, a 28-year-old man lost his life after he was trapped under a mudslide while traveling on the Tlapa-Marquelia highway. More than 70 homes in the municipality were damaged and 55 families were displaced. The storm also damaged 23 roads, forcing their closure, and caused 17 communities to lose power. In Jalisco, 834 homes in the municipalities of Villa Purificaci√≥n, Tomatl√°n, and Cabo Corrientes were damaged, and schools across the 30 municipalities of Jalisco were closed on September 30. The Aquiles Serd√°n bridge connecting Cabo Corrientes with several communities collapsed due to flooding, and there were two reported fatalities as a result of the storm in Jalisco. Damage statewide were estimated to be exceeded 300 million pesos (US$15.2 million).

Biography Little is known of Alnwick's early years. He certainly originated from Northumberland, and a 'Martinus' is recorded in several disputations at Oxford University at the end of the 13th-century, possibly Alnwick. The first definite record of Alnwick was in 1300, where he was one of the Oxford friars who unsuccessfully requested the licence to hear confessions from the bishop of Lincoln, John Dalderby. At Oxford, Alnwick soon received a Doctor of Theology and, in 1304, became the 32nd regent master of the University's Franciscan schools. In 1311, Alnwick was summoned to Avignon to participate in a controversy surrounding poverty among Franciscan friars, with the radical Spiritual Franciscans supporting absolute poverty among Franciscans, and the more orthodox Conventual Franciscans taking the side of wealth. He was made one of four advisors to the general minister, and spoke in favour of the Conventuals. The Council of Vienne (1311-2) eventually declared in favour of this sect. On 1 October 1318, Alnwick's previous request was vindicated, as he obtained a license to hear confessions in the diocese of York. A volume was composed, recording his Determinacio and disputations, and held in the library of the Augustinian Friary, York, though it is now lost. According to John Bale, Alnwick died in 1336 and was buried at Newcastle. Works One work reliably attributed to Martin Alnwick, is nineteen questions at the end of William of Ware's commentary on Peter Lombard's The Four Books of Sentences. This commentary, and Alnwick's questions, are scattered among five separate manuscripts (Bordeaux, Biblioth√®que Municipale, MS 163; Troyes, Biblioth√®que Municipale, MS 501; Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Vat. lat. 4871, MS Vat. Chigi B. VII. 114; Vienna, Nationalbibliothek, MS 1424). These questions elucidate Alnwick's difficulties when contemplating God's nature. The majority of the questions are inspired by established Franciscan theology, but several follow in the less orthodox tradition of the secular philosopher, Henry of Ghent. Some questions accept Henry's idea of the division of god into his \\"speculative and practical ideas\\", though Alnwick opposes Henry on some other theological issues. Two other works have been falsely attributed to Alnwick: a commentary on books 1‚Äì2 of the Sentences, now held at the library of San Antonio, Padua, which is now known to be by William Alnwick; and a Universal Chronicle printed in 1750, now known to be by Martin of Opava.

The twelfth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and second Category5 hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Lorenzo developed from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on 22 September, growing larger in size over the course of its development. On September 26, it rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane before weakening due to an eyewall replacement cycle. After completing the cycle, Lorenzo rapidly restrengthened, peaking at Category 5 intensity. Steady weakening followed as the storm moved through unfavorable atmospheric conditions. Accelerating northeastward, Lorenzo skirted the western Azores on 2 October, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical cyclone moved quickly towards Ireland and the United Kingdom and became the first named storm of the 2019‚Äì20 European windstorm season. Through late September and early October, large swells were generated by the hurricane's massive wind field, impacting much of the Atlantic basin. The French ship Bourbon Rhode capsized amid the violent seas on 27 September; among its 14 crew members, three were rescued, four drowned, and the remaining seven are presumed dead. Four people drowned in rip currents along the coast of North Carolina, and two people were found dead after being swept away by large waves along the coast of New York. Dangerous sea conditions also spread to Bermuda and as far south as the Caribbean coasts of South America. On 2 October, Lorenzo passed near the western Azores, briefly bringing strong winds to much of the archipelago. Flores and Corvo endured the worst of these winds, with a maximum gust of recorded on the latter island. The extratropical remnants of Lorenzo then affected Ireland and the United Kingdom on October 3 and 4, bringing gusty winds and heavy rains. Meteorological history Map plotting the track and the intensity of the storm, according to the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scaleThe position of Lorenzo's Category 5 peak is not depicted in this graphic as it is an asynoptic point (i.e. not at the 6-hour intervals of all other points) occurring at 03:00 UTC September 29. On 19 September, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave that was forecast to emerge from the west coast of Africa; the tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on 22 September. Due to favorable conditions, the system quickly organized, and at 00:00 UTC on the next day, the wave organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen. Six hours later, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name Lorenzo, while south of Cape Verde. Lorenzo further intensified into a Category1 hurricane early on 25 September and became a Category2 hurricane the following day. Over the ensuing 48 hours, the storm underwent rapid intensification, reaching its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of and a central pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg) at 00:00 UTC on 27 September. Hurricane Lorenzo near its initial peak intensity on September 26 IR Animation of Hurricane Lorenzo reaching peak intensity, September 29SSEC/CIMSS, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. As Lorenzo began to turn slowly northward, the hurricane weakened with the onset of an eyewall replacement cycle and intrusions of dry air. The hurricane bottomed out as a low-end Category3 hurricane on September 28. Although restrengthening was not forecast due to moderate wind shear and low ocean heat content, Lorenzo defied expectations and rapidly reintensified into a Category4 hurricane upon completing its eyewall replacement. Continuing to intensify, Lorenzo reached Category5 strength at 03:00 UTC on September 29, becoming the easternmost hurricane of such intensity recorded in the Atlantic basin, surpassing Hugo in 1989. Lorenzo's peak was short-lived because of increasing wind shear, cooler waters, and an intrusion of dry air; the hurricane lost its Category5 status 3 hours after peak intensity, and weakened faster than it had strengthened. By 18:00 UTC, only 15 hours after peak intensity, it had weakened below major hurricane strength. The hurricane's large size caused it to upwell cool water. Early on October 2, Lorenzo began extratropical transition, passing west of Flores Island. By this time, it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane, but still brought hurricane-force winds to the islands. Lorenzo became fully extratropical by 12:00 UTC on 2 October. The extratropical cyclone continued moving quickly northeastward, maintaining an expansive wind field, which resulted in an extended period of gale-force winds for Ireland. The circulation center of the cyclone became ill-defined shortly thereafter. =Records= In addition to being the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, Lorenzo featured the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to the east of 45th meridian west. Additionally, Lorenzo spent more days as a major hurricane east of 45th meridian west than any previous cyclone on record, surpassing Carrie of 1957. Preparations and impact =Bourbon Rhode= On 26 September, the Luxembourg-flagged anchor handling tugboat Bourbon Rhode, with 14 crew members on board, issued a distress signal at 08:20 UTC about from the eye of Lorenzo‚Äîapproximately west of Cape Verde. At the time, the hurricane was rapidly intensifying from Category 2 to Category 4 strength. The ship continued to receive signals until 12:20 UTC, by which time it presumably sank. The bulk carrier SSI Excellent arrived the following day as search and rescue operations began; a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft was diverted from a research mission to assist in the search. Additional commercial vessels and French aircraft arrived over the following days. Three crew members were spotted on a life raft by a French aircraft and rescued on 28 September. By October 2, four bodies were recovered while the remaining seven crew members were still missing. With no additional signs of the crew, French authorities suspended rescue operations on 5 October. The three survivors were transferred to Martinique on 6 October, while the bodies of the four other crewmen were repatriated to their families. On 7 October the tugboat ALP Striker reported distress flares. Search and rescue resumed on 9 October, albeit at a much smaller scale, after calls to French authorities by the Croatian and Ukrainian governments. Relatives of those on the ship established a fund to pay for private jets to continue aerial surveillance. However, in its final report on the storm, the NHC concluded that the missing crew members perished, leaving three survivors of the 14 crew members. On 4 October, relatives of crew members and people who worked on the vessel indicated that repairs on the ship were incomplete and it was not ready for a trans-Atlantic voyage. In particular, the propulsion and steering systems were not of sufficient quality. =Americas= Despite being over away from the storm, United States National Weather Service (NWS) offices in Florida and North Carolina warned that the swells from Lorenzo could cause rip currents and beach erosion. People in coastal areas were advised to avoid being by the beaches. However, four people drowned after being caught in rip currents in North Carolina. In New York City, three people were swept away by strong waves. One of them was rescued, but the other two were found dead. In Rhode Island, one fisherman drowned after falling into rough surf, and in Florida, a man drowned while swimming in rough conditions caused by the hurricane. In Bermuda, Horseshoe Bay was closed to swimmers because of the dangerous swells. The storm's influence on sea conditions was felt as far south as the coasts of the Caribbean and South America. =Azores= Early on 30 September, the Instituto Portugu√™s do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) issued hurricane and tropical storm watches for the Azores, which were upgraded to warnings later that day. Schools and government offices were closed on 2 October and people were told to remain indoors. Azores Airlines cancelled all flights to the islands. Lorenzo was regarded as the strongest storm to hit the islands in 20 years. Wind gusts of were recorded at Corvo Island, while gusts at Faial Island and Flores Island reached and respectively. Wave heights reached in the islands. 53 people were left homeless and had to be relocated. The most serious damage occurred at the Port of Lajes das Flores, the only commercial port on Flores Island. The port building and some cargo containers were swept away, while the dock itself was partially damaged. On 3 October, the government of the Azores declared an \\"energy crisis situation\\" in Flores and Corvo due to difficulties in supplying fuel to the two islands. Limits were placed on the sale of petrol at petrol stations on the two islands for the rest of October. Total damage across the island chain were around ‚Ç¨330 million (US$362 million). =Ireland= Hurricane Lorenzo approaching the British Isles on October 2. On 2 October, Met √âireann issued an orange wind warning for six counties on the western coast. Met √âireann also noted the potential for coastal flooding and damage due to large storm surges. On the next day, Met √âireann issued a yellow wind warning for the entire country, and issued yellow rainfall warnings for Connacht, Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. Several flights at Dublin Airport were cancelled. On 3 October, the extratropical remnants of Lorenzo passed over an M6 Buoy, which is located about west of Mace Head in Galway, recorded a pressure of . The buoy also noted waves of near the center of Lorenzo. A peak gust of was observed at Mace Head. Thousands of homes and businesses lost power, with the Electricity Supply Board restoring 12,000 outages during the night of 3‚Äì4 October; another 7,500 homes remained without power in the morning. By Friday, 4 October, all power had been restored. Donegal town was partially flooded after of rain fell as the River Eske approached high tide. Floodwaters reached deep in houses next to the river, while several roads were blocked. The nearby towns of Bundoran, Frosses, and Laghey also suffered significant flooding. Damage in the country was generally minimal, with no injuries or major incidents reported. =United Kingdom= On 2 October, the Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for parts of Northern Ireland, as well as Cornwall, Devon and parts of Wales. One person was killed in Stafford after being struck by a falling tree.https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/man-dies-after-being- struck-3389233 In general however, disruption from Storm Lorenzo was minimal, with the weather warnings lifted by 4 October.

It is the first scripted comedy series presented in the vertical video format and designed to be watched on smartphones. The show stars Charlotte Nicdao as Lucy Goosey ‚Äì a 23-year-old wannabe influencer ‚Äì and Gemma Bird Matheson as her down-to-earth friend Daisy Laing. In the first episode, Lucy flips her car while simultaneously webcasting and driving, earning her the nickname #Flipgirl. Her video goes viral on social media and she attempts ‚Äì unsuccessfully at first ‚Äì to capitalise on her instant fame. After exploring several video genres, Lucy finally finds real celebrity but her friendship with Daisy is ruined. In the final episode, Lucy publicly apologises to Daisy, who attempts to contact Lucy. When a clip showing the accident was webcast on Facebook, some viewers mistook it for a real-life accident and it went viral, attracting 1.2 million views on Twitter. Reviewers gave Content a mostly positive reception. Plot Charlotte Nicdao and Gemma Bird Matheson as Lucy and Daisy in Content, which plays out entirely through the lead characters' smartphones. Twenty-three- year-old graduate Lucy Goosey crashes her car while live-streaming on Facebook. The video of the accident goes viral; awed by the number of viewers it attracts, Lucy attempts to become an internet celebrity. To capitalise on her crash video's viral status, Lucy conducts a live mukbang, attempts yoga and gets lost while bushwalking. When her Instagram account is hacked, Lucy's private messages and an embarrassing image are exposed, costing Daisy a job promotion. After a failed attempt at making a make-up video, Lucy posts a rant about internet beauty gurus; her video goes viral and her Instagram account becomes verified, launching her career as a social media influencer. When Lucy attends an influencers' party rather than Daisy's graduation, Daisy is upset and ends their friendship. In the final episode, Lucy apologises to Daisy in a public YouTube video; Daisy watches the video and, feeling worried, she calls Lucy but quickly aborts the call. When Lucy ‚Äì who has a new phone ‚Äì sends Daisy a text message enquiring about the caller's identity, Daisy replies, \\"soz, wrong number\\". Writing and production Content was written by Anne Barnes and produced by Ludo Studio (Bluey, Robbie Hood) for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The show's executive producer and director Daley Pearson initially wanted to pitch the idea of a comedy about a 19-year- old life coach. He said, \\"We thought the show would be about a big influencer and it was set on their phone, but then I was like, I don't want to watch a show about a celebrity\\". Pearson's idea changed into one of a show about an ordinary person who suddenly and unexpectedly experiences internet fame. Que Minh Luu, another of Content four executive producers, pitched to the ABC the idea of a television show that could not be watched on television; the ABC liked the idea but wanted more information. Together with the ABC's Content Innovation Lab, Luu's department made some prototype videos to demonstrate the concept. They engaged writer Ann Barnes, who developed a script template for the series. Barns said: > \\"It was a lot of writing the world: comments, tweets, text messages. A lot > of it was writing ancillary content, but that's what makes the story ... > what's on Lucy's Facebook, what her mum writes. Stuff you wouldn't think of, > like when someone sends a text message, what were the five text messages > above it? I'd have to write all that.\\" The process of developing the concept of telling a story entirely through a smartphone and persuading backers to finance the project took two years. Screen Queensland and Screen Australia joined the ABC in funding the series after Ludo produced a sample video. Except for a few key moments, the smartphone interface elements of Content were not screen-captured but were animated by Canadian film-making collective Shy Kids. To reflect the characters' smartphone use, the animators needed to replicate the behaviour of a real smartphone. Greg Francis of Shy Kids said, \\"It was imperative to us that the show feels like an honest depiction of two 20-somethings on their phones\\". Lucy's first-episode car accident was filmed at a stunt park. To simulate the crash, the static car‚Äîwith Nicdao sitting in the driver's seat‚Äîwas rolled onto its side using attached wires. Flying shards of glass and external elements were then added electronically. Reception =Going viral= Shortly after the first episode of Content was posted on the internet, Ludo's co-founder Daley Pearson promoted the show on Reddit. Around the same time, another Reddit user posted images from the show. On Twitter, user @ArsonArtist posted the footage with the caption: \\"Don‚Äôt stream and drive, thot\\". The clip posted to Twitter received around 500,000 views on that platform; many Twitter users believed the incident was real and criticised Lucy for her poor driving. Charlotte Nicdao responded to the video's viral status with the tweet; \\"DAISY IM VIRAL\\". =Critical reviews= Jini Maxwell of Screenhub Australia awarded Content three-and-a-half stars out of five. Watching it on a smartphone, the reviewer called the format \\"immersive\\" and said they felt a \\"moment of panic\\" during Lucy's first-episode FaceTime call, \\"half-expecting my own face to appear on-screen when the call is answered\\". Maxwell said the characters' text messages \\"felt genuine\\", which is \\" a testament to strong writing\\". The reviewer also said the show's tone \\"feels judgemental\\", that Lucy is \\"held up as the ultimate millennial joke\\", and that \\"it‚Äôs disappointing to see such an interesting format wasted on a condescending sentiment\\". Maxwell's review concludes; \\"With a format as interesting as this, and cast and writing team who are clearly engaged with their material, I really hope the show gets brave enough to bore me a little more\\". Caitlin Welsh of Mashable said Lucy is \\"a bit annoying and occasionally too one-note\\" and that Nicdao and Bird Matheson \\"have an easy chemistry that‚Äôs explored in creative ways without breaking the conceit\\". She said the series' lack of pandering to those unfamiliar with the world of social media is \\"a smart choice that's instrumental in making it feel real\\"; that the show \\"feels like a surprisingly coherent cross between a regular TV show and looking over someone‚Äôs shoulder at their phone on the bus \\", and that it \\"manages to show how we build real lives and relationships through our phone screens, as well as how we can break them\\". Bridget McManus of Sydney Morning Herald awarded Content three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote; \\"this peek into the online world of Lucy Goosey ... should terrify ‚Äì and possibly irritate ‚Äì anyone over the age of 30\\", and said the show is \\"a clever step into the future\\".

It was the first time that a southern hemisphere nation has had the honour of hosting this prestigious event. The congress was a comprehensive success and a number of visitors from other countries commented that it was the best event they had attended, and that Melbourne could be proud of its presentation.https://surveying.org.au/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Traverse-321.pdfhttps://sssi.org.au/knowledge- hub/news/dr-ray-holmes-am Burke and Wills expedition In 2007 and 2008, Holmes led expeditions that located Plant Camp, where explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills buried their navigational equipment and other possessions on 3 April 1861, just days before heading south in a doomed attempt to find their support party. The Camp was located on an isolated creek bed on a Kidman pastoral lease in Western Queensland. Found buried in about three centimetres of riverbed mud was a brass case with a spirit level that was identified as belonging to the expedition's surveyor and astronomer Wills, along with other artefacts that included a pair of scissors, a darning needle, a horseshoe, buckles, rifle and revolver shells and some brass hinges and screws. The items have since been gifted by Holmes to the State Library of Victoria.https://surveying.org.au/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Traverse-321.pdfhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/sense- of-adventure-drove-20-year-burke-and-wills- search-20080613-2qbn.html{https://lionsredhill.vic.lions.org.au/files/lionsredhill.vic/issue%2027%20hill'n'ridge%20newsletter.pdf Retirement Since retiring from full-time employment, Holmes worked as a consultant to both the World Bank and FAO as an expert adviser on land administration.https://surveying.org.au/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Traverse-321.pdf  References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Surveyors General of Victoria Category:Members of the Order of Australia ","title":"Raymond Holmes (surveyor)"},{"id":"61910075","text":"Fitzpaine may refer to: *Cheddon Fitzpaine, a village and civil parish in Somerset, England *Cheriton Fitzpaine, a village in Devon, England *Okeford Fitzpaine, a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset in South West England *Staple Fitzpaine, a village and civil parish in Somerset, England *Wootton Fitzpaine, a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in South West England ","title":"Fitzpaine"},{"id":"61910081","text":"The W.E.B.

Its main purpose was to connect the Liberec and Jablonec regions with western Silesia. In 1992, the 12 km section between Tanvald and Harrachov was declared a cultural heritage site. It is known as \\"Ko≈ôenov Toothed Rack Rail\\" (or in Czech also \\"Polubenka\\") ‚Äì and features a unique more than four-kilometer long two-track Abt rack system. The Jizera bridge is the best known construction on this railway line. It consists of a steel construction and brick pillars. In 2014 the Czech National bank issued a 5000 CZK commemorative gold coin as part of the Bridges in the Czech republic series. The coin was designed by Vladim√≠r Pavlica.  Description  It is a steel bridge towering on granite pillars over the Jizera river. It crosses the valley between the Jizera Mountains and the Giant Mountains. The bridge was built as part of the Hirschberg (now Jelenia G√≥ra) - Gr≈±nthal (later Polubn√Ω, now Ko≈ôenov) railway line (at that time running on the Prussian territory). The bridge length is 116.5 m, max height is 25 m, it consists of four fields, the slope of the track is horizontal and there is no rack on the bridge.  History  The railway construction was completed on 1 October 1902. The railway began to operate the passenger transport in steam traction first, the freight transport was added 10 months later. The line was primarily used to run freight trains with Prussian coal. In February 1923, a regular electrical operation began. The bridge history reflects the history of the railway line in this border area. At the end of World War II the Jizera river became part of the Czechoslovak - Polish border and the train traffic across the border, and thus over the bridge as well, ceased in November 1945. In 1958, territory was swapped between Czechoslovakia and Poland. and the Harrachov track including the Jizera bridge fell under the management of the Czechoslovak State Railways. On 26 May 1963 the operation has resumed. In February 1997 the traffic from Ko≈ôenov to Harrachov was stopped due to the poor condition of the Jizera Bridge. Although the bridge was repaired at a cost of over a million CZK and was reopened in June 1997, the passenger transport from Tanvald to Harrachov was stopped on 27 September 1997. Freight trains from Ko≈ôenov to Harrachov did not run this line at that time and so the Jizersk√Ω Bridge remained without traffic. On 24 May 1998, the regular transport was resumed under the auspices of the Jizera Railway and GJW Praha. However, the promising traffic was not of long duration and thus the operation and management of the line returned to ƒåesk√© dr√°hy starting 1 December 1998. As of 2019 the bridge is owed by the Railway Infrastructure Administration. The railway line runs Czech Railways and GW Train Regio trains.

During his long career, American film director Quentin Tarantino has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects are officially cancelled and scrapped or fell in development hell. 1980s =My Best Friend's Birthday= Long before his directorial debut with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino met with Craig Hamann and was introduced to his 30-40 page script, My Best Friend's Birthday. Tarantino helped expand the script up to 80 pages and agreed to direct the film. On a $5,000 budget and a 16 mm camera, the film was shot in the span of four years. The completed run time came out to 70 minutes but due to a lab fire during editing, the film was nearly destroyed. The remaining 36 minutes was saved, roughly edited together, and displayed at several film festivals. =Untitled '70s Exploitation script= After Tarantino met Lawrence Bender at a Hollywood party, Bender encouraged him to write a screenplay. His first attempted script, which he described as a \\"straight 70s exploitation action movie\\" was never published and was abandoned soon after. 1990s =Green Lantern film= In the 1990s, Tarantino was offered a chance to write and direct a film adaptation of Green Lantern. He declined the offer, despite being a huge comic book fan. =Iron Man film= Tarantino was linked at one point to an Iron Man film for New Line Cinema. Nothing came out of this. =Luke Cage film= After the release of Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino contemplated developing a film based on Luke Cage. Being a huge fan of the character, Tarantino held a meeting with producer Ed Pressman, who owned the film rights to Luke Cage, and proposed a film based on the character and suggested casting Laurence Fishburne as Cage. Despite liking the idea, Tarantino shifted his interest for Pulp Fiction. =The Man from U.N.C.L.E.= Tarantino was briefly attached to a film adaptation of the 1960s TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. He opted to do Jackie Brown instead. Eventually, a film adaptation of the show was released in 2015 to lukewarm critical and box-office results. =The Psychic remake= Sometime in the 1990s, Tarantino considered remaking Lucio Fulci's 1977 giallo Sette note in nero (Seven Notes in Black), released in America as The Psychic. He intended for Jackie Brown co-star Bridget Fonda to star in the film. By the year 2000, Tarantino gave an update on the proposed remake: \\"It‚Äôs a project in the murky future. I don‚Äôt even own the rights to that stuff. It‚Äôs one of those things where it‚Äôs like if somebody buys the rights to make it, I won‚Äôt make it. They can totally fuck it up. If it‚Äôs meant to happen, it‚Äôll happen.‚Äù Since that remark, no other updates have emerged since. =The Killer Inside Me= In the mid-1990s, after the success of Pulp Fiction, Tarantino was attached to direct The Killer Inside Me. Uma Thurman was set to star as Amy Stanton. Juliette Lewis was considered for the part of Joyce Lakeland and Brad Pitt was attached to star as Lou Ford. This effort fell through after the September 11 attacks, because the film script was deemed too violent. The film was eventually directed by Michael Winterbottom in 2010, without the involvement of Tarantino.Sundance '10: IFC Films Acquires Alba Starrer 'The Killer Inside Me' from bloody-disgusting.com =Silver Surfer film= Fresh off of the success of Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino went to Constantin Films with a completed script for a proposed Silver Surfer film. Ultimately, Constantin Films passed on his script. =Tarantino's Battlefield Earth= In the late 1990s, after collaborating together on Pulp Fiction, John Travolta personally approached Tarantino to direct the film Battlefield Earth. He passed on the project, due to scheduling conflicts. =Tarantino's Men in Black= Tarantino was at one point offered to direct a film adaptation of the comic book The Men in Black. He turned the project down in favor of Pulp Fiction and Barry Sonnenfeld was chosen to direct the film in 1997 to critical and box office success. =Tarantino's Natural Born Killers= Tarantino sold his Natural Born Killers script to producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy for $10,000 after his previous attempt to direct the film himself on a half a million dollar budget. Hamsher and Murphy sold his script to Warner Bros. The script caught the attention of director Oliver Stone, who drastically reworked the script with David Veloz and associate producer Richard Rutowski, while retaining Tarantino's dialogue. Due to the heavy rewrites from Stone, Veloz, and Rutowski, Writer's Guild of America ruled out for Tarantino to receive story credit. Tarantino gave a negative response to the film. Despite wishing the best for Stone during the film's production, he responded to the film saying, \\"I hated that fucking movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie.\\" =Tarantino's Speed= Tarantino was also offered to direct the film Speed. He turned the offer down in favor of Pulp Fiction. 2000s =Untitled 1930s gangster project= Tarantino first teased at the Morelia International Film Festival in Mexico back in 2009 about possibly doing a crime film in the style of a 1930s Warner Bros-type gangster film; nothing came from this since then. =Casino Royale= In the mid 2000s, Tarantino expressed interest in directing Casino Royale, the 2006 film adaptation of Ian Fleming's debut novel and the debut of James Bond. Unfortunately, Eon Productions had no interest in hiring Tarantino. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with Casino Royale. Tarantino also said he would have set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan returning as Bond. By February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director, and the film was released on November 14, 2006 to critical and box-office success. =Untitled disaster project / Airport 2005= Tarantino wanted to take his hand at another popular '70s genre film, where Jackie Brown was with blaxploitation and Kill Bill was with kung-fu films, this time with a disaster film. Taking inspiration from films like The Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure, and Airport, Tarantino wanted to get as many of his reoccurring actors as possible and jokingly dubbed this Airport 2005. He remarked his casting choice as so: \\"Travolta could be the pilot, Pam Grier the stewardess, Robert Forster, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Bridget Fonda.‚Äù No other updates have emerged since then, and Forster died on October 11, 2019. =Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!= Tarantino expressed in January 2008 his interest in a raunchy remake of the 1966 sexploitation film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. The film has quite an influence on Tarantino; even going as far as to referencing the movie and giving co-writer/director of Faster, Pussycat!, Russ Meyer, thanks in his 2007 film Death Proof. His top casting choices would have been Kim Kardashian, Eva Mendes, and Britney Spears. By July of that same year, Tarantino was considering casting porn star Tera Patrick as Varla. When the rumor of Britney Spears playing Varla was brought to his attention, a source close to Tarantino replied that, \\"There is no truth to this.\\" Actress Tura Satana clarified in an interview that she is working closely with Tarantino in rewriting the script. Since then, no other updates have emerged from his remake. =Grindhouse 2= Both Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have expressed interest in making a sequel to their 2007 double-feature film Grindhouse. Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an \\"old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others\\" for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying \\"We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're still trying to figure out Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat.\\" =Hostel: Part III= In the 2000s, Tarantino acted as an executive producer for Eli Roth's films Hostel and Hostel: Part II. In July 2009, Roth confirmed that he would not be directing Hostel: Part III and Tarantino also did not return as an executive producer. =Untitled Howard Hawks-style project= Tarantino had expressed interest in making a screwball romantic comedy film in the vein of Howard Hawks films that would've starred two A-list leads. No other news updates have emerged since. =Untitled John Brown biopic= In 2009, Tarantino had expressed interest in doing a biographical film, despite having such disdain for the genre. According to him in an interview on Charlie Rose, he mentioned: =Kill Bill Vol. 3= In April 2004, Tarantino told Entertainment Weekly that he was planning a sequel: At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Tarantino stated that, after the completion of Grindhouse, he wanted to make two anime Kill Bill films: an origin story about Bill and his mentors, and another origin starring the Bride. Details emerged around 2007 about two possible sequels, Kill Bill: Volume 3 and Volume 4. According to the article, \\"the third film involves the revenge of two killers whose arms and eye were hacked by Uma Thurman in the first stories.\\" The article adds that the \\"fourth installment of the popular kung fu action films concerns a cycle of reprisals and daughters who avenge their mother's deaths\\". At the 2009 Morelia International Film Festival, Tarantino stated that he intended to make a third Kill Bill film. The same month, he stated that Kill Bill 3 would be his ninth film, and would be released in 2014. He stated that he wanted 10 years to pass after the Bride's last conflict, to give her and her daughter a period of peace. In December 2012, Tarantino stated: \\"I don't know if there's ever going to be a Kill Bill Vol. 3. We'll see, probably not though.\\" In January 2016, it was reported that Tarantino has spoken with Thurman on a potential return for a sequel, but noted that Tarantino remains non-committal on actually making a sequel. In July 2019, Tarantino stated: \\"Me and Uma have talked about it recently, frankly, to tell you the truth, I have thought about it a little further. We were talking about it literally last week. If any of my movies were going to spring from my other movies, it would be a third ‚ÄòKill Bill.‚Äô‚Äù In December, Tarantino said he had spoken to Thurman about an \\"interesting\\" idea for a new film: \\"It would be at least three years from now. It is definitely in the cards\\", while Uma Thurman confirmed that \\"Tarantino wrote something\\" =Kill Bill video game= In 2002 it was announced that Vivendi Games (originally Black Label Games) had acquire the rights to develop a video game based on Kill Bill that was meant to coincide with the film's 2003 release, with Tarantino serving as creative consultant.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_46772 The projected was shelved in 2003,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news051103killbill with some demo footage leaking online.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaJ9Qw9Wzpc&feature;=emb_title =Untitled Kung-fu mandarin project= Following the success of his Kill Bill films, Tarantino began developing a kung-fu followup film that would be entirely in Mandarin. It was to be made before Inglourious Basterds. The inspiration to do another martial arts film came from Tarantino seeing Zhang Yimou's House of Flying Daggers at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It wasn't known if Tarantino would hire fluent Mandarin people or celebrities that would have to learn Mandarin. The plan on releasing was to have two theatrical cuts, one with subtitles and the other with an out-of-sync English language dubbing, similar to old-school re dubs. Since then, no updates have emerged from the ambitious project. =The Vega Brothers / Double V Vega= When developing Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino began to consider making The Vega Brothers. The film would've starred Michael Madsen as Vic Vega (Mr. Blonde) from Reservoir Dogs and John Travolta as Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction. In 2007, due to the actors' ages and because of their character's death in their respected films, Tarantino claimed that the film, retitled Double V Vega, was \\"kinda unlikely now.\\" =Westworld= Following an unexpected box-office flop from his film Death Proof, he was offered to work on tentpole, bigger budgeted films. One such project was a remake of the Michael Crichton film Westworld. Tarantino rejected the offer and went to work on other films. 2010s =Django/Zorro= In 2015, a Django Unchained sequel crossover comic entitled Django/Zorro was released by Dynamite Entertainment. In June 2019, Tarantino had picked Jerrod Carmichael to co-write a film adaptation based on the crossover comic book series. In December 2019, it was reported that Tarantino was looking to make a smaller, stand-alone film, leaving development on Django/Zorro in doubt.Tarantino's 'Star Trek' No Longer Happening? =Untitled family film= In 2011, Tarantino briefly mentioned that he would like to do a childrens film. He recalls in an interview on the Reelz Channel: =From Dusk till Dawn 4= In December 2010, the production of a fourth From Dusk till Dawn film was in the planning stages, but further work on this possibility has not been revealed. In November 2013, it was reported that From Dusk till Dawn: The Series had begun production, without any further mention of the film. =The Hateful Eight (stage adaptation)= In early 2016, Tarantino announced that he plans to direct and write a stage play version of The Hateful Eight. Since then, the stage adaptation has not been released. =Killer Crow= In a late 2012 interview with the online magazine The Root, Tarantino described his next film as being the final entry in a \\"Django-Inglourious Basterds\\" trilogy called Killer Crow. The film will depict a group of World War II-era black troops who have \\"been fucked over by the American military and kind of go apeshit. They basically ‚Äì the way Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and the Basterds are having an 'Apache resistance' ‚Äì [the] black troops go on an Apache warpath and kill a bunch of white soldiers and white officers on a military base and are just making a warpath to Switzerland.\\" Since then, no updates have emerged. =Less Than Zero remake= In May 2010, Bret Easton Ellis, author of the 1985 novel Less Than Zero, confirmed in an interview that Tarantino had been \\"trying to get Fox to let him remake the 1987 film\\". In 2012, when asked whether Less Than Zero would be remade, Ellis once again confirmed that Tarantino \\"has shown interest\\" in adapting the story. At the San Diego Comic- Con in 2014, Tarantino revealed he is contemplating a possible science-fiction film. =Untitled medieval project= In January 2010, Tarantino announced that his next film, after Inglourious Basterds, will be a medieval film. He offered a role to Helen Mirren as a foul-mouthed monarch. The film was to retain Tarantino's signature traits, bloody violence and foul language, and was to be set in England's Middle Ages. Mirren had previously played a queen in 2006's The Queen as Queen Elizabeth II and was willing to play a monarch yet again. Although she was interested in the role, no other updates have emerged from this project, and his follow-up film to Inglourious was Django Unchained. =Star Trek= It was announced in December 2017 that Tarantino had pitched an idea to Paramount Pictures for a new Star Trek film.Quentin Tarantino And JJ Abrams Team On Star Trek Pitch A writers room, consisting of Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, Megan Amram and Drew Pearce, was assembled to flesh out the concept. The plan would be for Tarantino to direct the film, with J. J.

He was born at West Bay, Cape Breton Island and studied at Pictou Academy, Dalhousie College, and the Presbyterian College in Halifax. He served as a missionary to Labrador in 1888‚Äì89, and was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in 1891.Yoo, pp. 396-397. McKenzie resolved to go to Korea as a missionary, but he was unable to obtain denominational support, so he went as an independent missionary. He arrived in Korea on 12 December 1893. He witnessed both the Donghak Peasant Revolution and the First Sino-Japanese War.Yoo, p. 413. McKenzie worked in Songchon \\"completely isolated from Westerners... he dressed as a Korean scholar, ate only Korean food and set up residence in a Korean house, even sleeping on the traditional Korean ondol.\\"Yoo, pp. 400-401. McKenzie instilled a self-supporting spirit in the Korean Christians; Young-sik Yoo calls this \\"the most remarkable contribution McKenzie made to Korean mission history\\".Yoo, p. 402. He also started a school which taught boys and girls together, \\"an unheard practice in a Confucian society.\\"Yoo, p. 406. In June 1895, McKenzie became ill from sunstroke and typhus, and shot himself. Young-sik Yoo cites the American medical missionary, J. Hunter Wells: > About the first duty as a doctor I was called upon to perform was to > investigate the suicide of Mr. McKenzie who was possessed of the erroneous > idea of the appropriateness of isolation, exile, Korean food and so forth... > when he shot himself he was a victim to the 'isolation-exile' theory.Cited > in Yoo, p. 419. McKenzie's suicide is often omitted in biographical descriptions.E.g. Tark, cited above. Elizabeth McCully's 1903 biography A Corn of Wheat makes no mention of it, but says: > Through that hard night and the Sabbath morning following, he fought bravely > for life; but the release was near and the \\"good soldier of Jesus Christ\\" > was done with his earthly battles. While Mr. Saw and the other Christians > were at morning service and a young boy watched beside him, death came. W.

History Nh√† B√®, 27 September 1967 The base is located in Nh√† B√® District approximately south southeast of Saigon at the junction of the So√†i R·∫°p and L√≤ng T√†u Rivers. The base was first established by the US Navy in May 1966 to support Operation Game Warden and particularly patrolling of the Rung Sat Special Zone. Mine Squadron 11, Detachment Alpha equipped with 12 minesweeping boats (MSBs) ( long, wooden- hulled boats) were the first Navy vessels deployed there Construction of the base first involved the dredging of 300,000 cubic yards of sand, filling and compacting of the marshland, following which construction included barracks for 400 men, storage for 3,000 barrels of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL), a storage warehouse of 8,000 square feet, a communications and administration building, ammunition storage, two antenna towers, a mess-hall, a pier, and the required road, water, sewerage and power facilities. The overall construction period took 14 months, however the base began operation as construction was ongoing and by late 1966 Nh√† B√® was also the base for three platoons from SEAL Team 1 and was also a Patrol Boat, River (PBR) base. By August 1967, a two- helicopter detachment from HA(L)-3 was located at the base. On 2 January 1968 a Viet Cong (VC) 75mm recoilless-rifle attack against on the base wounded two sailors and scored a direct hit on an MSB which was destroyed. In May 1968 Mine Squadron 11, Detachment Alpha became Mine Division 112. From September 1968 on six medium minesweepers (MSMs, formerly LCM(M)s) and four drone minesweepers (MSDs) of the newly created Mine Division 113 were based at Nh√† B√®. The base was transferred to the RVNN in April 1972. Located on the L√≤ng T√†u River north of the base, the Nh√† B√® fuel depot was the largest fuel storage facility in South Vietnam with approximately 80% of the nation's storage capacity. On the night of 3 December 1973 the VC hit the fuel depot with rocket fire destroying or damaging 30 fuel tanks and igniting over 600,000 barrels of fuel. Early in 1975, the RVNN created Riverine Task Force 99 based at Nh√† B√®. The base remains in use today by the Vietnam Coast Guard.

Rodr√≠guez referred to in the draft, stating that if any immigrants did not comply with its provisions, they would have to leave Panamanian territory.

They were both operated by the same company throughout their history, and were both connected by the Deeside Tramway to the Llangollen and Corwen Railway.  History  = Early working: 1870-1900 = The original owner of the Deeside quarry was the 1870 Dee Side Slate and Slab Quarry Ltd. The company was sold in 1875. In 1876, the Moelferna and Dee Side Slate and Slab Quarries Company was formed to purchase both the Deeside quarry and the Moelfferna quarry. In 1885, the quarries supplied a large slab cistern to the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. The tank measured by by and was believed to be one of the largest stone tank built at the time. = Accidents: 1900-1915 = In 1907 there was a serious accident at the quarry. Edward Rowlands was riding on a loaded slate wagon that was sent down from the Deeside quarry to the head of the incline down to Glyndyfrdwy. Rowlands was on the first wagon of a sequence of four, with the quarry manager Richard Roberts following in a second loaded wagon. The brake failed on the fourth wagon and it gathered speed; the quarryman leapt from the wagon and shouted a warning to the men ahead. The quarryman on the third wagon also jumped free, and the two out-of-control wagons collided with Robert's wagon. He jumped, but sustained serious injuries. The three wagons then hit Rowlands' wagon, derailing all four wagons and causing Rowlands fatal injuries to the lower body. In 1915, two men, Robert Jones and John Lloyd, were crushed by an unexpected rockfall, weighing 100 tons, in the quarry. = Decline and closure: 1918-1947 = After the First World War, the chairman of the company was Percy Dean, who was the MP for Blackburn. The Deeside quarry ceased working in the 1920s, but the Deeside slate works continued in production using slate from Moelfferna quarry. The enterprise closed in 1947.  Transport  The gauge Deeside Tramway connected the two quarries to the Deeside Slate Works and on down to the transhipment wharf at Glyndyfrdwy. The tramway originally ran between the slate works and Deeside quarry, before being extended in the late 1870s down to the wharf.  Geology  Several beds of Ordovician shales and mudstones run across Mid Wales, from Tywyn in the south-west to Chirk in the north-east. At various points along this band, these sedimentary rocks have undergone compression and metamorphosis into slate. The Pen-y-glog slate veins on the southern slopes of the Dee valley are worked by the quarries.

Biography  Born in Craiova, he started Infantry Officer School in 1905. He graduated in 1907 with the rank of 2nd lieutenant, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1910. From October 1913 to March 1915 he attended the Higher war School in Bucharest and was promoted captain. After the Kingdom of Romania entered World War I on the side of the Allies in August 1916, Macici fought in the Romanian Campaign. He commanded a machine- gun company from the 41st Infantry Regiment in the battles at Meri»ôor and the Vulcan Pass. For these actions he was awarded in April 1917 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd class, and promoted to the rank of major. Later that year, at the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, he lost his right eye. After the end of the war, he advanced to lieutenant colonel (April 1920) and colonel (July 1927), serving as Chief of Staff for the 2nd, 16th, and 18th Infantry Divisions. In 1928 he took command of the 92nd Infantry Regiment in OrƒÉ»ôtie, where he met and married Ileana Dobo. From 1932 to 1934, he was the commanding officer at the Land Forces Academy in Sibiu, after which he commanded the 17th Infantry Brigade. Upon being promoted to the rank of brigadier general in August 1937, Macici became commander of the 9th Infantry Division. He rose to the rank of major general in October 1939, and was appointed on September 10, 1940 commander of the 2nd Army Corps, which was stationed in Northern Dobruja. On June 22, 1941, Romania joined Operation Barbarossa on the side of the Axis, in order to reclaim the lost territories of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in June 1940. Macici fought with the 2nd Army Corps against the Soviets in the Danube Delta during Operation M√ºnchen, and later advanced towards Odessa. When the city fell on 6 October 1941 after a 2 month siege, Macici and his 2nd Corps took over the city's garrison. On 22 October, a bomb went off at the headquarters of the Romanian 10th Infantry Division, killing 67 people, including 16 officers. Marshal Ion Antonescu ordered reprisals against Jews and Communists. General Macici reported back on 25 October the execution of some 13,000 Jews and Communists, most of them innocent civilians. This event became known as the 1941 Odessa massacre. In November 1941, he became commander of the First Army, which was based in Romania. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in January 1942 and didn't see much action, until King Michael's Coup of 23 August 1944, when Romania switched sides and became an enemy of Germany. The First Army suddenly had to fight the German troops based in Romania, but was able to hold the mountain passes until Soviet reinforcements arrived. Macici remained at the head of the First Army and participated in the advance in Transylvania and joint Soviet‚ÄìRomanian attack on Hungary and Slovakia. In October 1944 he participated in the Battle of Debrecen and the Budapest Offensive, where he suffered a serious defeat in the Battle of Szolnok, when the commander of the 4th Infantry Division, General Platon ChirnoagƒÉ, was taken prisoner by the Germans. Macici then fought with his army in the Western Carpathian Offensive, at the end of which he was dismissed. Later that year, he was arrested and was put on trial for war crimes between 14 and 22 May 1945, in particular for the 1941 Odessa massacre, on charges brought by prosecutors Avram Bunaciu and Dumitru SƒÉracu. The People's Tribunal sentenced him to death, but this sentence was later commuted to life in prison by King of Romania Michael I. After being detained at prisons in Jilava and DumbrƒÉveni, he was sent to Aiud Prison, where he was put in isolation regime at the \\"Zarca\\". He died there on 15 June 1950, and was buried at the penitentiary's cemetery. In July 1995, the Romanian First Army Corps \\"General Nicolae Macici\\" was awarded its battle flag through a decree signed by President Ion Iliescu.

The National Television Council ( or CNTV) is a Chilean government agency whose function is to oversee the operation of television services. It was first created by Law 17377 on October 24, 1970. Its existence is formalized in the Constitution of Chile, with its composition, organization, and powers defined in Law 18838 of 1989 and Law 19131 of 1992. Since 2001, it has participated in creating the contents of CNTV Infantil, an educational channel for cable television.  Composition  = 1970‚Äî1989 = After the passage of Law 17377 in 1970, the Council was composed of: * The minister of public education, who acted as the president of the Council. * A representative of the president of the Republic, of his free choice. * Three representatives, not members of Congress, elected by the Senate, in a single election where each member had a single vote and the three parties with the highest vote total were elected. * Three representatives, not members of Congress, elected by the Chamber of Deputies in the same manner as above. * Two representatives of the Supreme Court, selected by it. * The rector of the University of Chile. * The rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. * The rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so. * The president of the board of directors of Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile. * A representative of the workers of Televisi√≥n Nacional and another of the workers of the three existing university channels (Canal 9, Canal 13 and UCV Televisi√≥n). Decree Law 113 of October 29, 1973, modified the composition of the Council by eliminating the representatives of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (due to the dissolution of the National Congress after the coup d'√©tat of September 11) and the representatives of the workers of TVN and the university channels. = 1989‚Äî1992 = Law 18838 of September 30, 1989, established that the Council be composed of: * The president of the Council, appointed by the president of the republic with the consent of the Senate. * A representative of the president of the republic, of his free choice. * A representative of the Supreme Court, appointed by the latter, and who has served as minister of the court or lawyer of the same. * Two representatives of the commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces and the general director of the Carabineros. * Two representatives of Chilean universities, appointed by their rectors. The rectors of those universities that, directly or indirectly, were concessionaires of television services could not participate in the appointment of directors. = 1992 to the present = Currently, after the reforms introduced by Law 19131 of 1992, the CNTV must be composed of 11 members, one of whom, appointed by the president of the republic, presides over the Council. The rest are designated by agreement of the Senate. The directors must be persons of relevant personal and professional merits.

It is a member of the People Nation alliance.  History  The gang was founded in 1955 by Mexican youth who lived in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago. The original gang members were all related to one another. They named their gang the Texans in homage to the state they originally lived in. The name was changed two years later to Sons of Mexico City to better reflect their ethnic heritage. The name was changed again in 1959 to Latin Counts, inspired by the Polish Counts gang that operated in the nearby Back of the Yards community. During the 1960s, the Counts came into conflict with other gangs in the Pilsen area such as the Latin Kings, the Satan Disciples and Ambrose. In 1970, a faction broke off from the gang to be named the Bishops, who retained good relations with the Counts due to their sharing of the same bloodlines. Their alliance, known as the Bishop Count Nation, would falter in the 1990s. In 1978, the Counts were invited to join the People Nation, a gang alliance formed in the Pontiac Correctional Center. This enabled the Counts to enter a truce with the allied Latin Kings, but street-level conflict continued between the two gangs until the 1980s. Starting in 1980, the Counts began to expand their operations to the South Chicago and South Deering neighborhoods, and in the mid-1980s they expanded to Cicero, Illinois and Southwest Detroit. In 1991, a full-scale shooting war erupted with the Latin Kings over turf in Cicero that pitted all Counts and Kings against each other nationwide.\\"Latin Counts\\", Chicago Gang History.

Munro has also had significant public service roles including with the National Water Commission, AquaSure‚Äî the consortium building Victoria's desalination plant; Hydro Tasmania; as Secretary of the Victorian Government's Department of Primary Industries; and as Secretary of the Victorian Government's Department of National Resources and Environment (DNRE). Secretary DNRE Munro was Secretary of DNRE when concerns were raised in the Parliament of Victoria, on 17 April 2002 and again on 17 October 2002, regarding the attempted misuse of millions of dollars from the Estate Agents Guarantee Fund (EAGF) by Land Victoria, and Division of DNRE and the Department of Justice. Land Victoria was under Executive Director Elizabeth O'Keeffe. O‚ÄôKeeffe's leadership of Land Victoria was raised in the Victorian Parliament by Opposition environment spokesman Victor Perton on 17 April, 2002 for her leading role in the EAGF scandal. Specifically, Perton reported that Land Victoria and the Department of Justice (DoJ) had \\"conspired to invent a 'survey reform' project to extract $7.5 million from the fund. Land Victoria, under O'Keeffe's direction, and in collaboration with DoJ, was reported to have attempted to create ‚Äúthe survey project‚Äù to obtain extra government funding through EAGF, despite already having been funded. The administration of EAGF was under DoJ. Perton also reported to the Parliament that this was not the first attempt by Land Victoria to illegally obtain funds from the EAGF. The Auditor-General had prevented an earlier attempt by O‚ÄôKeeffe-led Land Victoria and the Department of Justice to ‚Äúraid the EAGF of $45 million\\". This earlier attempt was also during Munro's tenure as DNRE Secretary. Further, Perton reported that the Surveyor General had initially raised his concerns of the proposal to obtain funds from EAGF on 7 March, 2001. His concerns were dismissed by O‚ÄôKeeffe who ‚Äúresponded in threatening terms‚Äù that he was accountable to Garbutt and Munro through O‚ÄôKeeffe. https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202002/Assembly%20Autumn%20Parlynet%20Weekly%20Book%204%202002.pdf A subsequent investigation by the Ombudsman, ‚ÄúA conspiracy between members of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment and of the Department of Justice to defraud the Estate Agents Guarantee Fund‚Äù found the attempt represented a conflict of interest and was not ethical. The Ombudsman advised two whistle-blowers had come forward to his office which led to his investigation in accordance with ‚Äòpublic interest disclosures‚Äô under section 50 the Whistle-blowers Protection Act 2001 and launched on 19 June 2002. It was later reported that one of the whistleblowers was the Surveyor-General of Victoria, Keith Bell. Also, the Surveyor-General had earlier reported his concerns to the Auditor-General who stepped into to prevent it proceeding.https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202002/Assembly%20Parlynet%20Extract%2017%20April%202002%20from%20Book%204.pdfThe Ombudsman found that the \\"projectising\\" of the survey function was little more than a scheme to obtain additional funding, despite already being appropriated. The Ombudsman concluded: ‚ÄúFinally, the allegations that arose when this matter was placed under scrutiny ought to stand as a warning to those entrusted with determining the eligibility of applicants and/or programmes for funding from the various Statutory Trust Funds.‚Äù https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL2003-06No12.pdf The Ombudsman's report included the respective responses from then DNRE Secretary, Munro and then DoJ Secretary Peter Harmsworth. Munro's response on behalf of DNRE did not acknowledge any of the Ombudsman's findings of inappropriate conduct by her department's officials and failed to take any responsibility. In contrast, Harmsworth's response on behalf of DoJ did acknowledge the conflict of interest and also acknowledged that his department had failed to provide sufficient information to the Auditor-General to appraise the proposed use of funds that would have been approved by the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet (ERCC). Sherryl Garbutt was then the Minister for Environment and Conservation, to whom Munro reported. Following the 2002 state election, Garbutt lost responsibility for Land Victoria in the revised Bracks Ministry, being replaced by Mary Delahunty, and Munro was no longer the responsible Secretary. During Munro's tenure as DNRE Secretary, DNRE, the Opposition raised the extreme political interference in the performance of the Surveyor- General's responsibilities. Such interference included: attempts to block or alter annual reports from the Surveyor-Generak; threats and intimidation by the former Executive Director of Land Victoria Elizabeth O'Keeffe; hiring of private investigators to investigate the Surveyor-General and his office; and efforts to interfere with the Surveyor-General's review of State electoral boundaries in his capacity as a Electoral Boundaries Commissioner. The Age, Herald Sun and ABC carried numerous reports of such interference and it was frequently raised by the Opposition in both Houses of the Parliament of Victoria reported in Hansard. Such reporting continued well after Bell resigned his appointment as Surveyor-General of Victoria in July 2003 and joined the World Bank. During Munro's tenure as DNRE Secretary there is no reporting of any action she took to prevent the interference. To the contrary, the interference continued under authorization of Minister Garbutt. The Surveyor-General reported through O'Keeffe to Munro and Minister Garbutt. https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202004/Assembly%20Autumn%20Weekly%20Book%206%202004.pdf Honours and recognition She was appointed as an Officer (AO) in the General Division of the Order of Australia in January 2018 for \\"distinguished service to public administration through leadership roles in the area of renewable energy, water and climate change process and reform, and to the performing arts'.

The music is composed by Pritam, with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. After five songs being released from the film as singles, the soundtrack album was released on 14 April 2019, by Zee Music Company.  Development  = Marketing = The first song of the film \\"Ghar More Pardesiya\\" was released on 18 March 2019. The beautiful, soulful number has been winning hearts all over with melodious vocals and the scenic picturisation upon Alia Bhatt, Madhuri Dixit and Varun Dhawan. The making video of the song, was released on 20 March 2019, which shows what all went behind the making of the song and its vibrant music visual. In the video, the different people who contributed towards the musical masterpiece, from singer Shreya Ghoshal to choreographer Remo D'Souza to designer Manish Malhotra and producer Karan Johar can be seen sharing their experience while filming the song. The 'jugalbandi' between Madhuri and Alia was the highlight of the entire song. While dancing, Alia was a vision in white. The second song \\"First Class\\" was released on 22 March 2019. The foot-tapper song which is penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya and choreographed by Remo D'Souza marks the entry of Varun Dhawan's character Zafar's entry in the period film. Set in Hira Mandi, the song presents the nuances of Varun's character with a subtle play of lyrics in a light-hearted manner. The song which features nearly 500 dancers also shows the mesmerising Kiara Advani showing off her elegant dance moves alongside Varun. Varun and Kiara have been sharing stills and glimpses from the song since a few days on their respective social media handles and their camaraderie has been liked by the audience, who had desperately waited to see the two dance in the song 'First Class'. Pritam, who has composed the song had earlier told BT that \\"The idea was to come up with a track that feels like a retro number from the 50s. We had to create a fun, mohalla song which has masti and mazak with a beautiful underlying layer of emotion. Striking that balance in terms of lyrics and the tune was challenging. It felt amazing when we finally cracked it.\\" Elaborating on this, he further added, \\"The character is being introduced to the audience; he talks about a lot of things he feels, sees and experiences around him, but believes 'sab first class hai.' That's how we got the title of the song. While I can't reveal the relevance of this number in the plot, I can just say that it takes the narrative ahead.\\" The title track of the movie, was released on 30 March 2019. The background score adds to the suspense to the story and leaves an effect on us just by its sound. Well, we all know how integral music is to Bollywood over the years, and we have had various experiments with the sounds and the music of films and their songs. Some stay with us and some are just experimental. Kalank's music is magical as it is experimental, and will stay with you. The instruments used for creating the sound are real and not computerized. These days, with the booming music industry, different ways are tried and tested to create sound, which people get the hang of, but this film's music certainly proves that old is gold. The real instruments have created music with a quality worth listening to and surely it does not go unnoticed. The fourth song \\"Tabah Ho Gaye\\" featuring Madhuri Dixit was released on 9 April 2019. The song has usual characteristics of Dixit. It is sung by Shreya Ghoshal and liked by the audience. Before the song's release, Karan Johar had shared the first look of the song and, in no time, fans were making comparisons with Madhuri's iconic song from Devdas called Maar Dala. However, the actor refuted the comparison saying that since the characters were different the songs are different too. Speaking to DNA, she said: \\"Bahaar Begum is a different personality than say a Chandramukhi. So, we had to choreograph (the song) keeping her mentality in mind. The challenge in this was that Bahaar Begum's character is such that given a choice maybe she wouldn't have danced also. Her character is like that.\\" Madhuri also revealed that the song comes at an emotional moment in the film. She was quoted as saying, \\"... it comes at a very emotional point in the movie. It's a slow song. It's an emotional song. The whole story and the characters come together in the song.\\" The fifth song of the film \\"Aira Gaira\\" was released on 13 April 2019.  Track listing   Reception  * Firstpost reviewed the soundtrack album, stating as \\"The music of Kalank seems to bolster the large-scale drama that the film promises, to optimum effect. The riveting soundtrack recreates an era gone by with its thorough research and extensive soundscape. But it is not just a faithful regurgitation of the period. While the soundtrack never truly derails from its classical ethos, songs such as 'Aira Gaira' and 'First Class' anchor it firmly to millennial appeal.\\" * BizAsia gave favourable reviews, with a final word stating that \\"The soundtrack of 'Kalank' is well worth the wait and disappearance of Pritam in 2018 as he makes a strong comeback with what could be the biggest soundtrack of 2019. This is true to what one expects from a multi-cast top A-league Bollywood production that features the work of Amitabh Bhattacharya with Pritam. They are both fire every time they come along as the deliver some unique melodies and composition that are difficult to fathom when one listens to their songs and wonder \\"how did they ever come up with this!\\" Kalank ‚Äì Title Track is one of those romantic songs that exudes talent in every aspect and is a genius arrangement. Ghar More Pardesiya is a top opening song that is classically perfect with a great melody and has a very strong star value and thus a strong personality. Tabaah Ho Gaye is good too but limited in its appeal and rather dull after a few listens. First Class and Aira Gaira are top party songs in their respective genre styles and give further depth and variety to the album. Musically one can't fault how Pritam conducts and composes his songs while carefully balancing the classical and modern relevance of each song. Except for a couple mediocre songs and some forcer filler songs the rest are almost spotless! Lyrics consistently range from good to brilliant while vocally one has Shreya Ghoshal and Arijit Singh leading the way for a great soundtrack! Overall this is a collector's album with a sound as grand as the film's sets, costumes and cast.\\" * Bollywood Hungama, gave positive verdict for the soundtrack as \\"Pritam comes up with a very good soundtrack for Kalank and is helped a great deal by lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya. Moreover, there is a consistency of sound right through half a dozen odd songs that feature in the soundtrack. Even though the film is set in the 40s and the music complements that era as well, even today's audience can well be entertained.\\" * Bollyspice rated the album 4 out of 5, as \\"As stated previously, budget would not have been a concern when Pritam was brought on to write this album. He has delivered a very long album, filled with dance numbers, thus giving all the stars their own chance to show off what they have. However, considering this length, not only in number but length of individual tracks, there are only a few singers employed across all the songs. Also, there is the padding of using reversions of the same song for a couple of the dazzling numbers here. This makes it very hard going through the album, especially in the modern Bollywood style of getting in singers for the odd rap break. At the same time, Pritam has not concentrated his instrumentation choices on the time period but more so towards the story itself, picking violins where others would have avoided for instance. All in all, this makes the album very heavy, very sad overall but where it shines, it shines like a thousand suns.\\"  References  Category:2019 soundtrack albums Category:Hindi film soundtracks ","title":"Kalank (soundtrack)"},{"id":"61910807","text":"Enghave Plads is an underground Copenhagen Metro station located at Enghave Plads in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Also found on Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island.  Habitat  O. deplanatus is found under boulders and among stones in the lower to mid tidal regions of the intertidal zone on sheltered rocky and gravel shores. It is distributed sparsely, with one individual per 5 m2.  Description  Adults average in size with a flattened oval-shaped carapace that is wide in the front with blunt lobed edges. This can be a rusty red to chocolate brown colour with light mottling. Underside may be a paler cream colour. The antennae are dark red to brown. Claws are large with a smooth texture. Fingers may be black or brown in colour. Walking legs are pale red with golden setae or hairs.  Behaviour & Diet  The black finger crab is a scavenger feeder. It feeds on snails, half-crabs and hermit crabs. It is known to chip away at the shells of larger snails before grasping the animal with its mouth-parts.

He was, however, denied habilitation by the Mecklenburg Ministry of Education.Karl Schr√∂der: \\"Karl Eggers. Ein Gedenkblatt\\", in: Johrbok. Rutgeben von den Allgemeenen Plattd√ºtschen Verband. Jahrgang 2, Berlin 1902, pgs.142‚Äì153. After receiving his Doctorate in law, he worked as a lawyer and Gerichtspr√§sident (Chief Judge). In 1854, he was elected to the Rostock Stadtrat (City Council). Two years later, he became seriously ill and resigned all of his positions for a curative stay in Italy. While there, he studied art and published essays on the subject in an art journal edited by his brother Friedrich; the '. In 1861, he moved to Berlin, where he cultivated connections with writers and artists, such as Emanuel Geibel, Paul Heyse, Adolf Wilbrandt, Otto Roquette, and Theodor Fontane. Perhaps his most important connection was with Heinrich Seidel, who introduced him to the editors at Verlag Cotta, a publishing house in Stuttgart. For many years, Seidel and Eggers shared a combination home and office in Berlin. During those years, he became a strong supporter of the Gabelsberger shorthand method.Obituary in the Deutschen Stenographen-Zeitung, 15. Jg. (1900), Nr. 15‚Äì16, 5 August He was a member of the Low German Society and, together with his brother, Friedrich, he published collections of poetry in Low German which, although critically praised, were not financially successful. A third edition was published and distributed by Verlag F. Fontane & Co. in 1890. After his brother's death, he completed a five volume biography of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch that Friedrich had been working on for several years. From 1895, he lived with his family in Rostock. Although technically retired, he was active in the Rostock Kunstverein (art association), the Altertumsverein (antiquities club) and the local Low German Society. The sculptor, Ludwig Brunow, created a bust of him, but it has since been lost. References  Further reading  * Tremsen.

The background score for the film is composed by Amar Mohile. The soundtrack album features nine songs, written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, and the song Lungi Dance\\" which was written and performed by Yo Yo Honey Singh. The album was released by T-Series on 1 July 2013.  Marketing  The score of Chennai Express was composed by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal-Shekhar, and the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track \\"Ready Steady Po\\" was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers and Smokey the Ghost/Smokey, along with Enkore, Brodha V and others. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of togetherness. Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song \\"1 2 3 4 get on the dance floor\\" was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song \\"Titli\\" was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of \\"Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari\\" was released. On 19 July 2013, T-Series uploaded a song to its official channel on YouTube; sung by Honey Singh. The song was titled \\"Lungi Dance ‚Äì The 'Thalaivar(r)' Tribute\\" in honour of the film actor Rajinikanth. On 25 July 2013, a promotional video of the song \\"Tera Rasta Main Chhodoon Na\\" was released. The music album was launched on 1 July 2013.  Track Listing   Critical response  The soundtrack album of Chennai Express received positive reviews. Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the album 4/5, saying that it is \\"a robust offering, which is full of new sounds and zany surprises\\", and that Vishal-Shekhar put in a lot of effort to bring out their best for the film. IBN Live gave the album 3.5/5 and stated that the album was another \\"winner\\" from Vishal-Shekhar. The composers were critically praised for blending different forms of music which \\"pepped\\" the otherwise usual Bollywood music. Yashika Mathur of DNA gave the album 3.5/5 and said that Chennai Express is \\"another winner from Vishal-Shekhar\\" that \\"boasts of a soothing bouquet of typical Bollywood numbers and some peppy tracks with exceptional mixing.\\" She wrote that it \\"is likely to appeal to music lovers of all age- groups and sentiments\\" and called it \\"[a]n entertaining all-rounder, the composers must be applauded for fusing different music and beats to pep up the otherwise usual Bollywood music.\\" Joginder Tuteja of Rediff.com gave the album 3/5 and wrote that the title song, \\"Chennai Express\\", is \\"just about average\\". He expressed his displeasure over Balasubramaniam's ill-suiting of voice for Shah Rukh Khan, and said that in all the song was not remarkable. He, however, complimented that the overall outcome was \\"satisfactory\\" with a few of the songs even standing out. Anand Holla of Mumbai Mirror said, \\"It's easy to imagine director Rohit Shetty's crystal clear brief to Vishal-Shekhar, involving words such as catchy, peppy, fun, and of course 'hit songs'. Given how happily formulaic the soundtrack has turned out, V‚ÄìS have given us a fair idea of what awaits us this Eid.\\"  References  Category:2013 soundtrack albums Category:Hindi film soundtracks Category:T-Series soundtrack albums Category:Action film soundtracks Category:Comedy film soundtracks ","title":"Chennai Express (soundtrack)"},{"id":"61910910","title":"Ding Bangchao"},{"id":"61910962","text":"Soglasiye () is a rural locality (a village) in Rognedinsky District, Bryansk Oblast, Russia.

During the Marcos regime, students were principal protesters against the government. LFS directed its attack against the government with the use of student protests. The assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983, the Marcos' government became vulnerable and the organization sets off a nationwide student mobilization. They have participated in protests against the government and have joined street demonstrations with workers which shifted the group into student radicalism. They became the principal actors in the removal of Ferdinand Marcos from power.

Little is known about the species, which is classified as nationally endangered.  History  Spio aequalis was first collected by Hugo Schauinsland in 1897 and named by Ernst Ehlers in 1904. It is not known exactly where the original specimen was collected but it was thought to be from near Waitangi on the Chatham Islands. Two years later, in November 1899, William Benham collected at least one specimen at Moeraki in North Otago. He later recognised it as the same species described by Ehlers. In 1949, several large specimens were collected by George Knox at Squally Bay on Bank Peninsula. However, this record was unpublished. Nearly 60 years later, Geoff Read found a living specimen on Banks Peninsula in 2008. This was followed by a further observation in December 2016 in the Wellington region and in June/July 2016 at Henderson Bay on the Aupouri Peninsula.  Habitat  The species is thought to live on exposed coasts, perhaps under stones for protection.  Description  S. aequalis is one of the largest known species of spionid. Specimens measure between in length and wide.  Behaviour & diet  Spio aequalis is likely to be a surface deposit-feeder and may burrow in sediment.

He wrote over 30 books for children and young adults, many of which were shortlisted for or won prizes. He was also the recipient of numerous awards including the Margaret Mahy Medal and Lecture Award in 2003 and the Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement for Fiction in 2014.  Biography  Quotation from The Conjuror by Jack Lasenby, Wellington Writers Walk, Wellington, New Zealand Born on 9 March 1931 in Waharoa, a small farming community in the Waikato, Lasenby was the son of Linda Lasenby (n√©e Bryce) and Owen Liberty Lasenby. He attended Waharoa Primary School and went on to Matamata Intermediate and Matamata College from 1943 to 1949. From 1950 to 1952, he studied at Auckland University College, where he first met Margaret Mahy, who was also to become a notable New Zealand children's writer. He later described her as \\"one of the three most intelligent people I've known, a dear friend, and a continual source of laughter, and imaginative wonder\\". Mahy, in turn, described him as \\"perhaps the most innately New Zealand writer of all New Zealand writers for children\\". As well as being (at various times) a postman, waterfront worker, gardener, fisherman and labourer, Lasenby spent about 10 years as a deer-culler and possum-trapper in Te Urewera where he sometimes said he got his education in the telling of tall tales around the camp fire. He was also a primary school teacher, editor of the School Journal and lecturer of English at Wellington Teachers' College before retiring at 55 to become a full-time writer. Lasenby's books are funny, witty, entertaining and imaginative. They include memorable and often hilarious characters such as Harry Wakatipu the talking horse, Aunt Effie and Uncle Trev, and range from tall tales and yarns to science fiction, dystopia and books set in the bush or in his own Depression- era childhood in small-town New Zealand. He recalled that \\"the Matamata district was alive with stories in my childhood, sad, funny, haunting\\". Lasenby lived at Paremata near Wellington in the 1980s, where he sailed on the Porirua Harbour and Pauatahanui Inlet. With Sam Hunt and Ian Riggir they published poems on an 1886 upright press obtained from the Government Printing Office. He brought up his daughter and two stepchildren there. Dominion Post, October 5 page C6: Obituary: Jack Lasenby Lasenby lived for many years in central Wellington and died on 27 September 2019, aged 88.  Awards and prizes  Many of Lasenby's books were shortlisted for or won prizes or were named as Storylines Notable Books. The Mangrove Summer won the Esther Glen Award in the 1989 LIANZA Children's Book Awards. The Waterfall was the junior fiction winner in the 1996 AIM Children's Book Awards.

History The church comprises an early 15th century tower, with a late 15th century nave and aisles. In 1856-57, the church was re-pewed. The north side was started in October 1856 and the south side completed shortly afterwards. The medieval chancel screen was reportedly in a poor condition and removed. A further restoration was carried out between 1904‚Äì05. The chancel was lengthened by to make room for an organ which was the gift of Mr Tilby of Teignmouth in memory of his wife. A stained glass window was added to the chancel in memory of William Henry Smith. A new chancel screen was erected to a similar design to that removed in 1856. All of the seating was replaced with oak pews. The wooden flooring in the aisles was replaced with Minton tiling. The old gallery at the west end of the church was removed, and the roof replaced by an oak wagon roof. The walls of the church had the plaster removed, and cental heating was installed. The new altar was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter on 6 April 1905. =Rectors= Organ The organ of 1905 The organ was installed by Hele & Co of Plymouth in 1905 at a cost of ¬£800 given in memory of Pauline Eugenie Tilby. The organ was opened on Thursday 15 June 1905 by Daniel Joseph Wood, organist of Exeter Cathedral. An electric blower was fitted in 1946. It now comprises 3 manuals and 34 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= *George Osborne Brown 1854 - 1860 *Miss E.A.

He was the violist of the Budapest String Quartet from 1936 until the ensemble disbanded in 1967. Kroyt was born to a Jewish-Ukrainian family in Odessa, but spent his early life and career in Germany where he had been a child prodigy violinist. From the outbreak of World War II until his death at the age of 72, he lived in the United States and had become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1944. Early life Kroyt was born in Odessa to Osip Kroyt and his second wife Cecilia. His father, a tobacco merchant, had been born in Russia near the border with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His mother was Austrian. Kroyt had an older sister Bertha (born in 1893) and a younger brother Miron (born in 1902). The family's apartment in the Jewish ghetto of Odessa was a meeting place for young radicals including Leon Trotsky and other members of the Bronstein family who were cousins of Kroyt's father. The Kroyts rented out one of their rooms to an art student who was also an amateur violinist. The four-year old Boris would listen to him and attempt to sing along with his playing. Taken with the child's music ability, he made him a violin out of cardboard. He later bought Kroyt his first real violin and persuaded a violinist friend of his to give the child proper lessons. Kroyt's mother was initially opposed to her son becoming a musician, but on the advice of the violin virtuoso who had heard Boris playing a Haydn string trio with two other children, she eventually relented and enrolled him at the Imperial Music College of Odessa. His teacher there was Fiedemann's brother Max. Kroyt made his first concert appearance at the age of nine, accompanied by Max Fiedemann on the piano. At the age of ten, Kroyt's mother decided to send him to Berlin to study at the Stern Conservatory under Alexander Fiedemann who had offered to pay for his travel to Berlin and his living expenses. Before he left Odessa, Kroyt gave a concert to raise further funds for his study in Berlin. He raised 1400 rubles at the concert which had been attended by a thousand people. Once Kroyt arrived in Berlin, Fiedemann persuaded the banker Franz von Mendelssohn (a relative of the composer Felix Mendelssohn) to provide Kroyt with a stipend and to finance the hiring of halls and orchestras for his soon- to-be concerts. Mendelssohn also gave Kroyt a violin made by Lorenzo Storioni. Kroyt returned to Odessa in 1910 for his Bar Mitzvah and to play at the Odessa Factory, Industry and Arts Exposition. It was the last time he would ever visit his native city. Kroyt lived in boarding houses in Berlin until 1912 when his mother and younger brother Miron (a student pianist) arrived in Berlin. His father and sister joined them in 1913. Later that year Kroyt graduated from the conservatory with the Gustave Hollander Gold Medal. Music career and marriage After his graduation from the Stern Conservatory, Kroyt embarked on an international concert career as a violinist, playing in solo recitals and violin concertos, and with string quartets. He played as a violin soloist under the conductors Richard Strauss and Erich Kleiber and in chamber ensembles with the cellist Pablo Casals and the pianists Artur Schnabel, and Artur Rubenstein. He founded his own string quartet in 1921 and from 1927 also played with the original Guarneri Quartet for seven years as its violist. He had learned the viola as a teenager in three days when Alexander Fiedemann, who had his own string quartet at the time, insisted that Kroyt substitute for the quartet's violist who had taken ill. In 1924 Kroyt played in the first post-World War I performance of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire in an ensemble that included Schnabel, the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and the soprano Marie Gutheil-Schoder. A loud disturbance with boos and shrieking from anti- modernists broke out as the performance began. The music theorist Fritz- Fridolin Windisch jumped onto the stage to continue the protests and had to be forcibly removed. At that point Schnabel, Kroyt, and Piatigorsky began playing a circus polka. The audience burst out laughing, after which the performance went on without interruption to a successful reception. To supplement his meager earnings as a classical musician in the 1920s, Kroyt also played jazz in the Ruscho and Tariffa caf√©s in Berlin and led a small orchestra that performed and recorded tango music and operetta tunes. Unwilling to have his real name associated with the orchestra, he appeared with them as \\"Tino Valerio\\". In 1932 Kroyt married Sophie (Sonya) Blumin. Born in Lithuania in 1908, she was the daughter of a wealthy Jewish architect. The family had settled in Moscow but fled Russia for Germany during the Bolshevik Revolution. She was a ballet dancer by training and had also studied law at the University of Berlin. Their daughter and only child, Yanna, was born the following year. Life was becoming increasingly difficult for Jewish musicians under Nazi Germany. In Germany itself, Kroyt could only play for Jewish organizations and he would need to concentrate on foreign engagements to support his family. In May 1936 he accepted an offer to play in an orchestra in Tel Aviv that was being formed by William Steinberg and Bronis≈Çaw Huberman. However, later that month his old friend Josef Roisman (1900‚Äì1974), who was the First Violin for the Budapest String Quartet, asked him to replace their recently resigned violist . Reluctant to move his young family to Palestine and an uncertain future and seeing the large number of international concerts for which the quartet were contracted, Kroyt accepted Roisman's offer. He played his first concert with the quartet on 31 August 1936 in Norway and would remain their violist until the ensemble disbanded in 1967. The Budapest String Quartet were in the United States when World War II broke out in Europe. They accepted an offer from the Library of Congress to become resident there, playing on the Stradivarius string instruments in the library's collection in an annual series of 20 concerts at the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Auditorium. The Kroyt family settled in a house in Northwest Washington, D.C. where they became known for their soir√©es which were attended by prominent musicians and political figures. Kroyt and his wife and daughter became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1944 and lived in the United States for the rest of their lives. Kroyt owned and played a Deconet viola. When the Budapest String Quartet took up residence at the Library of Congress, the library additionally loaned Stradivarius instruments to all its members. Later years By 1964 the Budapest String Quartet's activities were starting to wind down. Kroyt increasingly appeared in solo viola recitals or with other ensembles. In 1964 he also joined the staff at Marlboro Music School and Festival where he coached the newly founded Guarneri Quartet. Their name was suggested by Kroyt who had played in a earlier quartet of the same name before he joined the Budapest Quartet. The young pianist Murray Perahia, whom he met there, became his prot√©g√©. Kroyt described him as his \\"musical godchild\\". Another Marlboro alumnus, the violinist Jaime Laredo, described Kroyt as one of the biggest musical influences in his life. Kroyt also coached student string quartets at the University at Buffalo where the Budapest Quartet had a residency. The quartet's last performances as an ensemble were three concerts in Buffalo in February 1967. The music critic Michael Steinberg recalled meeting Kroyt in Buffalo the previous year: > It was an evening that ended with the Kroyts driving us to our hotel in an > absolutely awesome vehicle, about the size of a motor launch, furnished in > rich blues, frighteningly quiet, and representing a life style I had not > associated with the playing of chamber music. I remember, too, a man of rare > warmth, charm and humor, who spoke generously, perceptively, and with > pleasing irreverence, about his colleagues in the musical world. Kroyt was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1968. Despite an operation, his condition worsened and he had to cancel a planned South American tour with Murray Perahia. His last public appearance was on 18 October 1969 when he played in a performance of Beethoven's String Quintet at the Alice Tully Hall. He died less than a month later at the French Hospital in New York City. The Guarneri Quartet played at his funeral, and a few days later at his recital in Pittsburgh, Perahia dedicated a Bach sarabande to Kroyt's memory . After Kroyt's death, his widow Sophie continued the family's ties with the Marlboro Festival, serving as its social director until her death in 1980 at the age of 71. Family Both of Kroyt's siblings also emigrated to the United States and became U.S. citizens. His older sister Bertha, the first to arrive in 1916, worked as a dressmaker in Chicago and died in 1947. His younger brother Miron was a piano teacher and concert pianist. He often performed with his wife Claire Sheftel, a violist. He died in New York in 1984. Kroyt's daughter Yanna was a television producer, primarily for CBS and WNET. Her television adaptation of The Nutcracker starring Mikhail Baryshnikov for CBS was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1978. Her husband Nathan Brandt is a history writer and the former managing editor of American Heritage. In 1993, he published Con Brio, a history of the Budapest String Quartet. He and Yanna also co-authored In the Shadow of the Civil War: Passmore Williamson and the Rescue of Jane Johnson published by University of South Carolina Press in 2007. Yanna Brandt died the following year in a car accident at the age of 74. Their son Anthony Brandt is a composer and Professor of Composition and Theory at Rice University's Shepherd School of Music.

The 1st Anzac Corps of the British Fifth Army attacked in support of the Third Army, engaged in the Battle of Arras (9 April to 16 May 1917). The Report of the Battles Nomenclature Committee (1921) called operations subsidiary to the main Battle of Arras the Flanking Operation to the Arras Offensive. To compensate for the lack of time and artillery, a company of twelve tanks would lead the attackers into the Hindenburg Line defences by crushing the barbed wire against the XIV Reserve Corps (). The tanks were late and the attack of the 4th Australian Division was postponed but the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division did not receive the message and patrols advanced into the Bullecourt defences, suffering 162 casualties before they returned to the British front line, in what became known as the \\"Buckshee Battle\\". Next day the attack on Bullecourt went ahead, despite reservations, although several tanks broke down and others went off course. Both Australian brigades got into the German front position but were cut off and gradually overwhelmed, only a few Australians managing to break out. The Australians suffered including against casualties. The Australian division and corps commanders apologised to the survivors and their German equivalents received the . The survivors expressed bitterness and a great distrust of the tanks, despite them starting a panic among some German defenders; Australians blamed the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division for allegedly leaving them in the lurch. Distrust of tanks and of General Hubert Gough, the Fifth Army commander, lingered for much of the remainder of the war. Background =Hindenburg Line= General () Erich von Falkenhayn head of the German General Staff (, OHL) was dismissed on 29 August 1916 and replaced by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. The (the new supreme command) ended the offensive at Verdun on the Western Front and requested proposals for a new shorter defensive position in the Noyon Salient. Crown Prince Rupprecht, commander of Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (), was ordered to prepare a rear defensive line and work on the new {langdeSiegfriedstellung}} (Siegfried Position/Hindenburg Line) began. As the situation on the Somme deteriorated, Hindenburg ordered that the Somme front be given priority in the west for troops and supplies. By the end of September, Rupprecht had no reserves left on the Somme and another thirteen fresh divisions were sent to the British sector, troops being scraped up wherever they could be found. For the (defensive battle) expected in 1917, the Hindenburg Line was to be built across the base of the Noyon Salient from Neuville-Vitasse near Arras, through St Quentin and Laon to the Chemin des Dames (the Ladies' Path) ridge. The new fortified areas (, similar to ones built on the Russian front) were intended to be precautionary measures () to shorten the Western Front and economise on troops, creating more reserves against the offensives expected in 1917. The had the potential to release the greatest number of troops and was begun first. =Operation Alberich= Ludendorff ordered 9 February to be the first day of the (Alberich Manoeuvre) and 16 March the first marching day. On 17 March, the 1st Army, at the north end of the Bapaume Salient, withdrew swiftly; was abandoned by 18 March and next day Boyelles and Boiry-Becquerelle were evacuated. The withdrawal to the (Hindenburg Line), except for outposts and raids mounted on British outposts during 20 and 21 March, had begun Bapaume was abandoned, with many houses set on fire. Next day, parties of Germans at Beugny in the fought until nightfall then slipped away. A party at Vaulx-Vraucourt was surprised and driven back to Lagnicourt, which was lost on 26 March. A German counter-attack from Noreuil and a British attack on Bucquoy were repulsed. On 17 March, withdrawals by the 2nd Army, south of the Somme began and by 18 March, the other German armies and the southern wing of the 6th Army , began to withdraw from of the old front line [ as the crow flies]. The Somme River and canal crossings from Offoy to P√©ronne were destroyed and pools wide formed near road embankments, making crossings anywhere else impossible, the damage being made worse by the spring thaw. On 18 March the main body of German troops reached the Hindenburg Line () where work was still being done to remedy defects in the original position. Outpost villages close to the south of Qu√©ant had to be held for longer than expected to complete the additional defences. Heudicourt, Sorel and Fins were lost on 30 March. The northern outpost villages were captured on 2 April and Lempire fell three days later. =XIV Reserve Corps= During the Battle of the Somme in 1916, divisions had quickly become exhausted and it had proved impractical to replace corps headquarters and their constituent divisions at the rate necessary to rest tired divisions; corps HQ remained on the Somme and took over fresh divisions as they arrived. By 1917 the connexion between Corps HQ and their component divisions had been dissolved on the rest of the Western Front and territorial titles introduced. After the retreat to the , the XIV Reserve Corps (, [Lieutenant-General] Otto von Moser from 12 March 1917) held the from Croisilles to M≈ìuvres. The 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division ( ) had spent February and March as a training division at Valenciennes and then been sent to relieve the 26th Reserve Division from Bullecourt to Qu√©ant. The 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division was unimpressed by the new positions, the trenches and wire having no deep dugouts, ( shelters, pillboxes to the British) or rear defences. The 26th Reserve Division had spent the previous two weeks digging in but had made uneven progress. Over the weekend of 7‚Äì8 April, Infantry Regiment 124 (IR 124) of the 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division took over the centre of the divisional sector in front of Riencourt from IR 180 (26th Reserve Division) three companies of I Battalion on the right (western) side, three on the left and two in reserve in the cellars under the village but these had unprotected exits, vulnerable to artillery- fire. II Battalion was in reserve in Cagnicourt but the lack of dugouts prevented the troops being organised in greater depth. Infantry Regiment 120 (IR 120) took over on the right (western) flank and Grenadier Regiment 123 (GR 123) on the left (eastern) flank around Qu√©ant. The was on a reverse slope and the troops in the front position could not see far to the south-west where the British Fifth Army was closing up to the Hindenburg Line from √âcoust St Mein and the Qu√©ant railway embankment. Observation posts were established forward of the trenches and reconnaissance patrols kept watch. Prelude =Fifth Army= The original British plan for the Fifth Army to co-operate with the Third Army attack into the salient formed around Bapaume during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line () forestalled the British attack and the Fifth Army was ordered to push back German rearguards and prepare to attack the Hindenburg Line between Qu√©ant and Bullecourt, to support the Third Army offensive, a much more difficult task. The Fifth Army had been reduced to two corps and stripped of artillery; bringing up the remaining guns and ammunition over the supply desert created by German demolitions was a slow process. The Hindenburg Line was far more formidable than the decrepit defences abandoned during the withdrawal. If the Fifth Army penetrated the Hindenburg Line the task of the Third Army, extending its attacks on 11 April, southwards to the St Martin sur Cojeul and Wancourt areas, to push south-eastwards down the Arras‚ÄìCambrai road would be eased. Bullecourt was from the road at Vis-en-Artois and under at Fontaine- l√®s-Croisilles, the first objective of the Cavalry Corps advancing in front of the Third Army. Gough suggested that the Fifth Army could support the attack but for lack of means, only on a narrow front and Bullecourt was substituted for Qu√©ant, which was a much more formidable objective, behind four defensive positions. The attack would then pivot to the right flank to capture the junction of the Hindenburg Line and the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Switch Line (). If successful, the 4th Cavalry Division would pass through to meet the Cavalry Corps from Arras. Fifth Army attacks on 2 April captured the German outpost villages from Doignies to Croisilles and Gough ordered that risks be taken to advance as much heavy artillery as possible. On 5 April Gough issued orders to the two Fifth Army corps V Corps (Lieutenant-General Edward Fanshawe) and 1st Anzac Corps (Lieutenant-General William Birdwood) for an attack on a front with Bullecourt in the centre. The village of Riencourt was the second objective and Hendecourt the third, where the 4th Cavalry Division was to advance to rendezvous with the Cavalry Corps. The Fifth Army received D Company, Tank Corps, five tanks for each corps and two in army reserve. The heavy guns were delayed by German road demolitions and the field artillery had to be moved in relays due to a shortage of horses. The 4th Australian Division (Major-General William Holmes) was not able to use all its seven artillery brigades until 8 April, even after hauling field guns with crews and ammunition by lorry. On the right of V Corps to the north, the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division (Major-General Walter Braithwaite) took over from the 7th Division on 5 April; both divisional artilleries moved forward in stages and began wire cutting on 7 April. Australian patrols found no gaps in the wire, about deep, east of Bullecourt. =8‚Äì9 April= The Hindenburg Line defences enclosing the village of Bullecourt formed a re-entrant for about to the (Balcony Trench) around Qu√©ant, defended by the German 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division. On 8 April it was announced that wire cutting, begun on 5 April, would take another eight days. The Third Army began the Battle of Arras on 9 April with great success. Lieutenant-Colonel John Hardress-Lloyd, the commander of D Battalion, Tank Corps and the company attached to the Fifth Army suggested that rather than spreading the tanks along the attack front, they be concentrated to roll up the wire, creating a wide breach instead of several narrow ones. The twelve tanks should attack by surprise on a front of , only opening fire when they were through the wire. Gough ordered the tanks to attack the next day, 10 April, on a front of about between Bullecourt and Qu√©ant, leaving no time for rehearsals with the 4th Australian Division. The tanks were to advance first and crush the wire for the infantry and as soon as the Hindenburg Line had been captured, four tanks were to turn west towards Bullecourt, followed by an Australian battalion. The 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division was then to advance as far as Hendecourt. On the right flank, four tanks and Australian infantry were to capture Riencourt. Gough entertained doubts about the need for the attack because of optimistic reports from the Third Army and escaped prisoners of war that the Germans might retreat to the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Switch Line (). If patrols found that the objectives were unoccupied, both divisions were swiftly to occupy them. At dusk, patrols went forward and discovered that the Hindenburg Line was still occupied but that the wire cutting bombardment had made several lanes through the wire. Preparations were made in a rush, the 4th Australian Division to attack with two brigades, the 4th on the right and 12th on the left. A gap was left between the brigades to avoid a depression at a right-angle to the Hindenburg Line thought to be an obvious killing ground, dominated by machine-guns. Tanks were substituted for infantry and the two brigades were to close the gap once into the German defences. The attack had to cover to the wire and another to the first trench at about an hour and 48 minutes before the sun rose to evade crossfire in the re-entrant between Qu√©ant and Bullecourt. Artillery-fire would continue as normal until zero hour then maintain barrages ion the flanks. Buckshee battle, 10 April At Bullecourt was subjected to a gas bombardment by Livens projectors and Stokes 4-inch mortars, as the Australians assembled and waited for the tanks to arrive. Six battalions were out in the snow of no man's land. The left of the 12th Australian Brigade was only from Bullecourt and dawn was approaching. Zero hour was put back but the tanks had only reached Noreuil, away, having had to feel their way forward through a snowstorm and needed another 90 minutes to reach their start line. Holmes postponed the attack to get the infantry back under cover before they were seen; snow began to fall again and shielded the retirement. Notice of the cancellation did not reach the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division HQ until Patrols of the 2/7th and 2/8th battalions, West Yorkshire Regiment began to advance from and got through the fires belt of barbed wire ten minutes later. At German machine-guns began to fire on the patrols and at the British began to retire, leaving two Lewis gun crews behind. The patrols suffered by the time they were back over no man's land. Maur issued an order that opposing infantry had been seen over the railway embankment beyond Sector C North and that many troops were still there, warning that an attack was imminent against sectors A (Bullecourt) and C (Riencourt). No reinforcements were rushed to the area because of the crisis at Arras, the only troops in the vicinity being two battalions of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division working on a trench between Cagnicourt and Vis en Artois. Maur ordered that the divisional artillery was to conduct harassing fire in the railway; embankments and targets were to be bombarded at particular times. British batteries that were particularly effective were to be gassed as soon as they were identified; artillery and infantry strictly were to conduct liaison to ensure co-operation. During the night of 10/11 April, all three regiments of the 27th (W√ºrttemburg) Division sent out listening posts and patrols, which at (British time, German time was an hour ahead) heard engine noise, taken to be from lorries carrying up supplies. British artillery kept up a considerable bombardment of the villages but not the . A high state of alert was maintained and at reports of activity at the wire were received, the men stood to and then at the engine noise increased, indicating the beginning of a tank attack. 11 April =British tank advance= Resuming the attack after the fiasco of the postponement would give another 24 hours to prepare but Birdwood repeated his misgivings about attacking at all. Gough referred the matter to GHQ, which took the view that the maximum effort by the Third Army on 11 April justified the risks. Some revisions of the plan were made; once Bullecourt was occupied, six tanks would come under the command of the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division when it advanced on Hendecourt. At a conference at the 4th Australian Division HQ, the progress made in wire-cutting led to the infantry advancing fifteen minutes after the tanks, rather than waiting on a signal from the tanks that they were through the wire; the rest of the original plan was retained. One tank was unserviceable and only four of the remaining eleven reached their start line by Drowning the sound of their engines with machine-gun fire failed and it was clear that they could be heard in the German defences. Three of the tanks which had arrived were those allotted to the 4th Australian Brigade. The tank on the right deviated to the right under fire from German machine-guns, suffered mechanical difficulties and returned to the railway. Another tank also veered right and crossed the first trench of the opposite GR 123 about to the right of the attack front and was eventually knocked out by machine-guns firing armour-piercing (K bullet) ammunition. The next tank to reach the German lines was snagged by wire but crossed the first trench and was then knocked out. The last tank started late followed a similar path to the first. The four tanks comprising the left-hand section were late and two were knocked out short of the German trenches; the third tank arrived after the Australian infantry had reached the German positions and silenced a machine-gun firing from Bullecourt. The tank was hit twice, returned to the railway and was hit again. the last tank had ditched but one of the tanks that had veered off course and then returned pulled it free and towed it over the railway, by when it was Under the impression that the Australians were in Bullecourt, the crew drove over the German trenches and into the village where it suffered an engine failure. The surviving crew dismounted and got back to the railway. As tanks were immobilised, German artillery deluged them with shells and all but two were destroyed. =Australian attack= German artillery bombarded the assembly positions of the 4th Australian Brigade at (British time, German time was an hour later). A green flare rose from Bullecourt at followed by green and yellow flares. Australian troops tried to advance and suffered many casualties and where tanks did reach the German lines, they arrived piecemeal, diluting their psychological impact. As soon as the defenders realised that the expected attack had begun, SOS flares were launched all along the line for artillery-fire; when it arrived the infantry found it too sparse for Sector C. The Australians broke into the lines to the south-east of Riencourt along Sub- sector C1, held by the 1st Company IR 124. Reserves from IR 124 in Riencourt and the (artillery-protection line) prevented the Australians form advancing further from a sunken road running south-east from the village but were then overrun, an improvised counter-attack was defeated and the last thirty survivors retreated. Sub-sectors C2 and C3 were attacked by tanks which drove along the trench parapets firing into them. A tank was caught in the wire opposite Sub-sector C3 and engaged by a machine-gun firing armour-piercing bullets and then hit by a . Sub-sectors C4 and C5, held by the 10th and 11th companies were attacked at the same time and suffered casualties as tanks drove back and forth, forcing them out of both front trenches. GR 123, to the east, was confronted by two tanks and at an officer took a machine-gun and fired which penetrated, knocking out a tank and setting it on fire. Some German infantry were shaken by the effect of the tanks and the priority given to their destruction by the German artillery protected temporarily the Australian infantry. The plan depended on the tanks and their failure left the Australian infantry committed to an attack with far less damage to the German wire than intended, no creeping barrage and no more assistance from the tanks. At the 16th and 14th Battalions of the 4th Australian Brigade (Brigadier- General Charles Brand) had advanced in four waves, outstripping the tanks and receiving occasional artillery and machine-gun fire. As the first wave closed on the German front trench hundreds of flares went up, the dark of the infantry showing starkly against the snowy ground. The Australians made for the gaps in the wire, which turned out to be more cut than had appeared and got into the first trench. The wire in front of the second trench was uncut and the only way in was through German sally ports and communication trenches which had been fortified. The two battalions and parts of the 13th and 15th Australian battalions in support forced an entry, despite many casualties and bombed down the line. Many of the defenders ran for Riencourt but the rest fought on. The attack of the 12th Australian Brigade was delayed by the 46th Australian Battalion which waited for the tanks due to a misunderstanding over the amended plan and advanced at The British bombardment of Bullecourt had lifted to let the attackers in and the battalion, with the 48th Australian Battalion in support met far more defensive fire than the 4th Australian Brigade. The right of the 46th Australian Battalion advanced into the depression separating the Australian objectives, following the only tank that had appeared and driven into the wire, where they were shot down in the gap; on the left the battalion stayed on course and got into the German defences. The 48th Australian Battalion found that the wire was uncut but found ways through, bombed to the right to the central road in the depression and set up a post. By both brigades had taken their objectives apart from the 48th Australian Battalion which on its left flank had been unable to get beyond the Riencourt‚ÄìHendecourt road and the right flank of the 46th Australian Battalion which had been repulsed. Rather than being in tandem, the battalions were in echelon with only a slight overlap. The extent of the casualties left both brigades unable to attack their further objectives, Riencourt on the right and Bullecourt on the left, except for troops of the 4th Australian Brigade which bombed up a communication trench towards Riencourt. =Early morning= Once it was daylight the Australians had great difficulty in passing reinforcements forward but a company of the 47th Australian Battalion reached the 12th Australian Brigade and small carrying-parties with more grenades got over. Neither of the brigades inside the German defences was able to extend its inner flank to close the gap between them and would have to hold on until dark. At Brand ordered a barrage beyond the Hindenburg Line second trench and another barrage beyond the right flank but the artillery group commander demurred because of an erroneous report that tanks and infantry had passed through Riencourt and reached Hendecourt and another mistaken report that the British infantry were in Bullecourt. Eventually Birdwood was asked for a ruling and he refused to order the barrages; Fanshawe was also misled by the reports and ordered his division to advance into Bullecourt. The false reports led Gough to order the 4th Cavalry Division (Major-General A. A. Kennedy) to advance on Fontaine l√®s Croisilles and Ch√©risy, the Sialkot Brigade, waiting in the valley to the west of √âcoust, was told at that Bullecourt and Riencourt were \\"definitely reported as taken\\" and that it was to advance. A party of dismounted cavalry from the Lucknow Brigade ready to cut lanes in the German wire east of Bullecourt were stopped by machine-gun fire after twenty casualties. =German counter-attack= (Colonel) von der Osten, commander of the (53rd Infantry Brigade) had devised a counter-attack plan which anticipated a break in to the German defences and at ordered the reserve of IR 124 to counter-attack frontally as the storm detachments of IR 120 and GR 123 attacked from the flanks to roll up the Australians and recapture the front line. Machine-gun teams were sent to picked positions to cut off an Australian retreat and the (KTK, front position commander) of IR 124 gave the brief order, The Australians in the German defences received artillery support only on distant objectives and were isolated from their headquarters. When the 4th Australian Brigade ran out of grenades it was forced back. Brand decided that it would be futile to send carrying-parties with supplies across the open ground swept by bullets and shells; the remnants of the brigade not taken prisoner tried to retreat and suffered many more casualties. The situation of the 12th Australian Brigade had deteriorated even more. The 46th Australian Battalion in the first trench had been reduced to a few men and was forced out without being able to warn the 48th Australian Battalion further forward, which was surrounded. When the 48th Australian Battalion realised its predicament it bombed its way along communication trenches back to the first trench. The artillery of the neighbouring 2nd Guard Division and 220th Division added to the defensive barrage in front of Bullecourt and prevented any renewal of the Australian attack. As the Australians were being forced back, they were unable to salvage ammunition and grenades from the dead and wounded. The British artillery had eventually begun to fire a barrage but this fell on the Australian-occupied trenches, making them untenable. The senior surviving Australian officer ordered the second trench to be evacuated and then the first. At the 48th Australian Battalion, the last in the German trenches made an orderly retreated over the bullet-swept ground. By noon the German counter-attack had succeeded; few Australians had managed to re-cross no man's land through artillery and machine-gun fire. Aftermath =Analysis= Hubert Gough wrote in The Fifth Army (1931 [1968]) that the snow made the tanks stand out, disguising the sound made by the tanks failed and that six were knocked out in no man's land. The Australian infantry suffered many casualties in the absence of the disabled tanks but managed to get into the Hindenburg line defences but were then driven out in desperate fighting. In 1933 Charles Bean, the Australian official historian, wrote that the attack was \\"an experiment of extreme rashness\\" which failed \\"with shocking losses\\". Gough had persisted with the plan despite several warnings and that several Australian commanders had also made mistakes. Leaving a gap in the attacking line was understandable but the four tanks intended to fill the gap had been reduced to one, which failed to prevent German reinforcements and supplied being carried along a road running into the gap. Using only three machine-guns to camouflage the engine noise of the tanks was a serious error, which may have increased the number knocked out before they could be of use and some units waited too long; these failures only magnified the \\"gross blunders\\" of the plan. In 1940, Cyril Falls, the author of the British official History of the Great War volume 1917 Part 1, called the attack on 10 April a fiasco but that the fall of snow fortuitous allowed the troops of the 4th Australian Division to get back under cover in Noreuil. The 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division \\"suffered needless loss through a combination of accidents due to indifferent staff work\\". After the postponement on 8 April, Fanshawe gave an order, copied to the 1st Anzac Corps, that The order was not issued but on 9 April, the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division was told to patrol at dusk that afternoon‚Äìevening and at the division received a message \\"Zero hour will be \\" which was misconstrued as the order to begin the operation, not the patrols. After the defeat of 11 April, Australian opinion was unanimous that the failure of the tanks caused the disaster and that a conventional attack with an extensive preparatory bombardment and barrages would have succeeded. Falls wrote that the Australians were probably right and that a plan could have been devised for the tanks, not dependent solely on their success; In The Blood Tub (1998 [2000]), Jonathan Walker wrote that by nightfall on 11 April, the men of the 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division had achieved an outstanding defensive success during a week of defeats for the 6th Army. Walker called the failure of the tanks a matter of lesser importance than the decision by Gough to attack a re-entrant, on a narrow front, with deep objectives. Gough admitted this after the war but pointed out that supporting the Third Army was important. Walker suggested that delaying the attack could have been more advantageous to the Germans, unit histories dwelling on the incomplete state of their defences. Walker wrote that communication failures occurred at all levels of command, the 4th Australian Division being blamed for the British attacking on 10 April, after the main attack had been called off in what became known as the Buckhshee Battle. The machine-gun barrage to camouflage the sound of the tanks on 11 April was a failure and two tanks were left inside the German lines, the first that the Germans were able to study. Suspicion was sowed among the Australians of the usefulness of tanks was not dispelled until the Battle of Hamel (4 July 1918) and the use of Mark II training tanks, not impervious to armour piercing bullets must have contributed to the apprehensions of their inexperienced crews. The Australian artillery suffered from the lack of a preliminary barrage which prevented ranging and registration on likely targets, flash spotting and sound ranging still being unrefined. Walker blamed the Australian artillery commanders for poor observation, staff work and inflexibility, turning down pleas for artillery support, preferring to trust the reports of their forward observers, the ultimate responsibility for which was borne by Major-General W. J. Napier, the Fifth Army artillery commander. Jack Sheldon wrote in 2015 that the 53rd Infantry Brigade was required to explain why the Australians were able to break in to the German defences and replied that the sector of IR 124 had insufficient infantry, only for two trenches long, only two platoons holding the front line. The lack of defenders was proper for an attack preceded by a long artillery bombardment but not an attack with little artillery-fire and by extremely determined infantry. Defensive artillery-fire was dispersed over too wide an area and the troops lacked experience of anti-tank defence and the defences had been poorly designed, the wire in places being in front of the front trench () and dead ground on the right flank. German reports blamed tanks for the break in on the sector of IR 124, the \\"momentary confusion\\" allowing the Australians to get into the German positions, especially with only one man to of trench. Attempts to increase the number of infantry in the area had come to nothing because of the immense pressure being exerted by the Third Army further north. The battle was judged a costly defensive success and the divisions on the flanks did not intervene. Maur and Moser were awarded the . =Casualties= In the Australian Official History volume IV, The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917 (1933 [1982]) Charles Bean wrote that the 4th Australian Brigade suffered out of the involved and the 12th Australian Brigade German casualties were reported as taken prisoner. GR 123 suffered IR 124 IR 120 another German artillery suffered nine casualties and some of the losses of IR 120 was ascribed to the gas bombardment of 10 April. Cyril Falls, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War (1917 part I, 1940 [1990]) that on 10 April, the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division suffered most in the 7th West Yorkshire. On 11 April, the 4th Australian Brigade suffered of the in the attack and the 12th Australian Brigade suffered The Germans claimed for In 1998, Jonathan Walker wrote that the 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division suffered only casualties and wounded, IR 124 suffering In 2015, Jack Sheldon wrote that the 27th (W√ºrttemberg) Division claimed two aircraft shot down and that 53 machine-guns (mostly Lewis guns) had been captured. Nine tanks had been destroyed, seven in or near the German lines and that units that could prove that they had knocked out a tank received a bounty of 500. =Subsequent operations= The sector was quiet for about three weeks except for a constant drain of casualties to artillery-fire. On 15 April the Germans conducted Operation Battering Ram () against the 1st Anzac Corps. The attack was intended to delay the advance of the Fifth Army towards the Hindenburg Line, cause as many casualties and destruction of equipment, particularly artillery, as possible. was to deprive the British of the means to attack on the southern flank of the battle to the north, to gain time to prepare more defences and to show that the retirement to the Hindenburg Line had not diminished German morale or the ability to attack. The Fifth Army was preparing for another bigger effort, (the Battle of Bullecourt 3‚Äì17 May 1917). Two divisions of the XIV Reserve Corps () and two of to the south, fell on the positions of the 1st Australian Division and 2nd Australian Division. The Australians repulsed the attacks except at Lagnicourt where German troops broke in, took prisoners destroyed six artillery pieces and recovered confidential documents. Australian counter-attacks cut off some of the attackers and inflicted against The Fifth Army hurried forward more artillery and added more advanced posts. Preparations for the attack at Bullecourt continued and the Germans reinforced the Hindenburg Line () around Bullecourt. Notes Footnotes References    * Further reading  External links * Spears, E.

The duo of Atlanta-based rappers Aqsa Malik (also known as Smoke Hijabi) and Xeno Carr self-released the song on February 12, 2018, which was later re-released by Records Co and Columbia Records on December 14, 2018. It was included on their second EP, Mood (2019). The song was produced by Carr. The song is a diss track targeting Mia Khalifa, a Lebanese-American Internet celebrity and former pornographic actress. The decision to write a song dissing Khalifa arose over a misunderstanding. A faked screenshot, intended as a joke, seemed to show Khalifa criticizing Malik for smoking while wearing a hijab in a music video. iLoveFriday and their fans assumed the screenshot was real and took offense at Khalifa's apparent hypocrisy. Khalifa has not publicly commented on the song, however, a comment on a Tik Tok post on June 28th, 2020 from Khalifa's official account miakhalifa stated that \\"This... is my nightmares. God, this was global, I couldn't escape it.\\" Critics have praised the song for its unconventional catchiness, but it has also been criticized as off-key and misogynistic. Months after its release, \\"Mia Khalifa\\" achieved unexpected viral success on social media, especially among TikTok users. The best-known portion is Malik's verse, which opens with a line that became a meme: \\"Hit or miss, I guess they never miss, huh?\\"  Background and release  The song stemmed as a diss to Mia Khalifa after a faked screenshot showed Khalifa criticizing group member Malik for smoking while wearing a hijab (example pictured on a mannequin). The music video for iLoveFriday's 2017 song \\"Hate Me\\" showed Malik, a Pakistani- American woman, smoking a blunt while wearing a hijab, a type of veil worn by some Muslim women and traditionally used to maintain Islamic standards of modesty. The song and video were modest successes and gained traction within some online meme-centric communities. By January 2018, an Instagram account posted a screenshot of a fake tweet, attributed to Mia Khalifa, that criticized Malik and the \\"Hate Me\\" video. The fake tweet said: Not only was the tweet fake, but Khalifa is actually not Muslim and never has been. She was raised in the Catholic Church in Lebanon but is non-practicing. Although the screenshot was a joke, Malik said that she believed it was real when she first saw it and was shocked by the statement's apparent hypocrisy, given Khalifa's notoriety for appearing in a pornographic video performing sex acts while wearing a hijab. Malik said in an interview that smoking in a hijab is \\"not nearly as bad\\" as what Khalifa had done in a hijab. Many of iLoveFriday's fans also took the screenshot to be authentic and reacted with anger toward Khalifa. There has been some skepticism about whether the group members themselves realized the screenshot was a joke. Regardless, iLoveFriday recorded \\"Mia Khalifa\\" in response to their fans' demand for a diss track. The song was self-released on February 12, 2018.https://www.instagram.com/p/BfHsAlYAID_/ The music video for \\"Mia Khalifa\\" was released on March 4, 2018. The video was reportedly viewed about 5million times in the months before it became a viral meme. The song was later re-released by Records Co and Columbia Records on December 14, 2018. In early 2019, the original video was briefly removed due to a copyright infringement claim from Romanian artist Livia FƒÉlcaru, as multiple pieces of her original art appear in the video without her permission. On September 27, 2019, \\"Mia Khalifa\\" was released as the first track on Mood, iLoveFriday's second EP. Music and reception The song was produced by Xeno Carr. Malik's verse has been described as the highlight of the song with its distinctive, catchy delivery. According to college newspaper Minnesota Daily, \\"the song itself rose to notoriety not because of its associations with Mia Khalifa, but rather due to a bizarrely catchy rap bridge.\\" The opening lines have been the most frequently quoted and reused in memes: The song itself is sometimes known as \\"Hit or Miss\\" because of the lines. At Pitchfork, Duncan Cooper said the verse captured Malik \\"at her absolute brattiest\\". Cooper emphasized her delivery of the phrase \\"kiss yaaaa!\\", noting the quality of an \\"almost Midwestern whine\\" in her voice despite her Atlanta origins, and wrote that \\"her melodies are straight and piercing, catchy to an obnoxious degree.\\" A panel of reviewers at Vice roundly condemned the song, calling it \\"upsettingly misogynistic in a really specific and sick way\\" and \\"really off-key and shitty sounding.\\" According to Vices panel, iLoveFriday should issue \\"a formal apology\\" to Khalifa. An article in the college newspaper KentWired expressed similar feelings, further accusing the song of \\"pettiness\\" and criticizing the bland production and Malik's \\"grating voice\\". Bhad Bhabie‚Äîan American rapper and Internet celebrity, perhaps best known for saying \\"Catch me outside, how about that?\\" on Dr. Phil‚Äîcriticized the song as inappropriate for children who were likely to be exposed to it through social media. When asked whether she thought the Internet has a negative effect on children's psychological maturity, Bhad Bhabie replied: Even in the aftermath of its viral success, Khalifa has never publicly commented on the song. According to Reed Kavner at the site Tubefilter, \\"it's worth reiterating that [Khalifa] was an innocent bystander in all of this. She was the subject of a diss track after doing absolutely nothing. Today, she has 2.3million Twitter followers and a YouTube channel with her boyfriend celebrity chef Robert Sandberg. None of this will affect her at all.\\"  Viral success  = \\"Mia Khalifa\\" and TikTok memes = TikTok is a social media video app owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance. Formed from a merger with the app Musical.ly in 2018, TikTok allows users to post short videos and use audio clips from its database, generally to make lip sync videos. Some of the audio in the database is officially licensed by the copyright holders, but users can also upload an audio clip on their own, at which point the clip becomes available to other users. TikTok is particularly popular among Generation Z, defined as those born after 1996. The app has been compared to the defunct Vine. \\"Mia Khalifa\\" became ubiquitous on TikTok in late 2018 and early 2019. The song became so popular, and was so closely identified with the app itself, that it spawned a call and response meme called the \\"#hitormiss challenge\\" or \\"#TikTokTest\\". To participate in the challenge, TikTok users would wander into public areas like big-box stores or schools and holler the phrase \\"hit or miss\\", hoping to elicit a response from a stranger who might complete the line by calling out \\"I guess they never miss, huh?\\" The premise of the meme was that the phrase had become so well known among TikTok users that it could serve as a sort of \\"secret handshake\\" to find other users in the real world. As with the app itself, the song and its related memes were mostly produced and consumed by teenage members of Generation Z. The song demonstrated how social media, meme culture, and TikTok in particular function as important platforms for listeners to discover new music. In this capacity, it has been identified as a predecessor to Lil Nas X's \\"Old Town Road\\", another song by a previously unknown and unsigned artist that found viral success through TikTok. While other songs reached comparable levels of popularity on the app around the same time‚Äîincluding, for example, Ariana Grande's \\"Thank U, Next\\"‚Äî\\"Mia Khalifa\\" was different because its success was completely spontaneous. Grande was already a mainstream artist with major promotion and an established following, while iLoveFriday had minimal promotion and their song's unconventional style did not seem, on its face, calibrated to have broad appeal. PewDiePie, pictured in 2016, reused a \\"Mia Khalifa\\" clip from TikTok in several of his own YouTube videos and, in doing so, significantly contributed to the song's viral popularity. The 15-second \\"hit or miss\\" snippet from \\"Mia Khalifa\\" was first uploaded to TikTok by a high-school age girl from South Dakota. Then, a TikTok user named Georgia Twinn made a highly popular video using the same clip, drawing greater attention to the song. In October 2018, the user @NyanNyanCosplay lip-synced the song while cosplaying as the character Nico Yazawa from the Japanese multimedia franchise Love Live!. @NyanNyanCosplay's video was likely the catalyst that inspired the viral phenomenon around the song. @NyanNyanCosplay's video spread to YouTube, where PewDiePie‚Äîalready the world's most popular individual YouTuber‚Äîreused her clip several times in his own videos. Belle Delphine, who has been noted for popularizing the e-girl aesthetic online, also uploaded a notable video of her lip-syncing and dancing along to the song. The Daily Dot wrote that \\"Delphine's brilliant pink hair and coy personality quickly made the video a hit.\\" = Popularity based on metrics = Near the end of October 2018, there were more than 1.3million different videos on TikTok using the same sample; by December, there were more than 2.5million. By February 2019, at least 4million different \\"Mia Khalifa\\" videos had been uploaded to TikTok, the original music video had been viewed more than 50million times, and snippets from the song had been played in videos across YouTube approximately 200million times. The song also reached the number one position on Spotify's Global Viral 50 chart, a ranking of the most-streamed independent songs on the platform, and it consistently charted near the top position for several months. As of June 2020, TikTok videos which include \\"Mia Khalifa\\" have been viewed over 865 million times in total. Videos tagged with the #hitormisschallenge hashtag had collectively accumulated 93.7million views as of April 2019. By May, videos tagged with #hitormiss had reached a total of 250million views. Newspaper columnist Calum Marsh noted the existence of an hour-long compilation of dances to \\"Mia Khalifa\\" from TikTok. The song's lyrics were the 18th most-read on the site Genius in the first half of 2019, ranking ahead of \\"I Don't Care\\" by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber, and \\"Wish You Were Gay\\" by Billie Eilish. =Compensation= According to an estimate made by a Pitchfork writer, iLoveFriday probably netted $150,000 worth of royalty payments from YouTube views. The group's manager, Terrance Rowe, did not confirm that figure but laughed, suggesting that the estimate was close or perhaps too low. Despite their song's breakthrough success on TikTok, iLoveFriday had not initially licensed it for use on the app and never received compensation from the company for the song. However, by early 2019 they had worked out a deal with TikTok granting free use of the song in exchange for promotion of their future music. Rowe justified the group's decision by emphasizing that the opportunity for exposure would be more valuable in the long run than demanding compensation for past views. TikTok has been criticized for its royalties-payment structure. Citing iLoveFriday's situation, Cody Atkinson of Australian BMA Magazine said TikTok's payment seemed to be worse than streaming services or even busking. Brett Gurewitz of the Los Angeles-based punk rock band Bad Religion criticized the company and said the situation was like \\"what we saw with Chuck Berry getting a Cadillac instead of royalties.\\" See also * List of viral music videos * Islam and hip hop in the United States * Misogyny in rap music * Slut-shaming References Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:Diss tracks Category:Internet memes introduced in 2018 Category:Music memes Category:Songs about actors Category:Cultural depictions of pornographic film actors Category:Viral videos Category:Works about pornography Category:American hip hop songs Category:2010s fads and trends ","title":"Mia Khalifa (song)"},{"id":"61912347","title":"List of ambassadors of Ecuador to the Holy See"},{"id":"61912377","text":"Thomas Cobbold ( April, 1680, Rattlesden‚Äì1752) was an English brewer who established a family brewery in Ipswich.

Later, Moxley and Robinson would wrestle again in the G1 Climax on August 11, with Robinson winning and thereby preventing Moxley from winning the tournament. Moxley subsequently challenged Robinson to a No Disqualification match for the United States Championship at King of Pro-Wrestling. However, Moxley was unable to attend the event due to travel issues stemming from Typhoon Hagibis. Per NJPW rules, he was stripped of the title and a match between Robinson and Lance Archer for the vacant title was scheduled instead.

Privately-built to promote residential development in the suburb of Northbridge and beyond, the bridge opened in January 1892 as a steel suspension bridge finished in Sydney sandstone with crenellated turreted towers. The bridge was transferred to the Department of Main Roads in 1935 and, in 1939, was rebuilt as a reinforced concrete two rib arch bridge, with the sandstone towers kept.  History  =Original bridge= left With the land boom of the 1880s, land to the north of Long Bay, Middle Harbour, was sold and resold. The North Sydney Investment and Tramway Company or the North Shore and Middle Harbour Land Company made major investments in the area and planned to build a tramway and a bridge across Long Bay gully in order to open up the area for sales of residential land. A suspension bridge across the gully was opened to traffic in January 1892. It had taken two years and nine months to complete and cost A¬£42,000. With a suspension span of centre to centre of towers, it was considered one of the engineering wonders of Sydney and became a great tourist attraction. A toll of threepence return for adults and one penny for children was charged. The disastrous crash of 1892 saw both the above companies go into liquidation. The Depression of the 1890s slowed land sales and Northbridge did not develop as had been hoped; the tramway was not built. In 1894 a fundraising dance and promenade concert was held on the bridge. In 1912 the bridge was handed over to the NSW Government as a gift, on the condition that a tramway be extended to the north side and no toll charged. The tramway was extended over the bridge in 1913-14, with its terminus in Sailors Bay Road. Between its construction and its handing over to the Department of Public Works, the bridge was little used and poorly maintained for many years. Repairs and some strengthening works were carried out in conjunction with the construction of the tramway.Main Roads Journal, August 1937, p.152. The Department of Main Roads (DMR) assumed control of the bridge in 1935 and inspections soon revealed serious corrosion in the steelwork and cables, partly attributable to defects in the design of the bridge. Water had been allowed to accumulate around the suspension rods as they passed through the cross girder ends in small, undrained reserves that had originally been filled with a bituminous mixture, which had not stood the test of time. The main suspension cables were also found to be weakened by corrosion. The bridge was carefully monitored and it rapidly became clear that replacement or substantial rebuilding would be necessary. From several options, it was decided that a large concrete arch span to support the deck of the old suspension bridge was the most satisfactory solution. The towers themselves were in very good condition and were recognised by the DMR as having local significance as a landmark and tourist attraction and as having considerable historical value. For these reasons they were retained and repeated in the design of the new work, with much attention to sympathetic design. The bridge closed in May 1936. =Current bridge= The arch was designed and tested through the analysis of models within the DMR.Main Roads Journal, August 1937, p.152-155. The construction contract was awarded to Hornibrook Bros. & Clark Pty. Ltd. The bridge was closed to tram and vehicular (but not pedestrian) traffic and work began at the beginning of June 1937. While a 'Melan' system using a steel rib to serve as falsework and then reinforcement in the completed structure had been considered, the tenderers favoured the conventional system of timber falsework, and it was this system which was employed. An interesting innovation, however, was employed in the form of steel cylinders with base plate partly filled with a fine dune sand and fitted with a hardwood piston. The pistons bore the weight of the girders until it was time to strike the falsework when two small screw plugs on the cylinders could be opened to a carefully prepared schedule, with a large team of operators working to signals, and sand released so that the crown and then, gradually, the whole arch took up its own load. Worker safety was also an important factor in the design of construction methods for the bridge. The bridge was re-opened to traffic in late 1939.Main Roads Journal, August 1939, p.113-116.  Description  The original suspension bridge had a main span supported by steel cables and steel hanger rods. The deck was stiffened by an undertruss which was pin connected at the centre of the span. The steel cables were supported on ornate sandstone towers and anchored into bedrock at each end of the gorge. The wooden deck carried two lanes of traffic plus two tram tracks and footways. Deterioration of the bridge due to corrosion led to the replacement of the suspension design by an arch in the 1930s. With a main span of , the arch consists of two concrete ribs, peaking some above stream level. Supported on the arches are columns carrying the deck on 14 reinforced concrete beam slab spans. The deck has expansion joints at the large piers directly over the arch springs. These also transfer wind load from the arch and deck back to the foundations. Connecting these to the original towers are concrete beam spans. The concrete detailing was done in Victorian Gothic and Norman styles to reflect the Gothic sandstone towers, the main piers being given Norman castle features. As part of the reconstruction the roadway openings through the towers were increased to , and walkway openings cut through the towers. The bridge has light standards supported by the concrete railings. = Modifications = * Suspension system (which was corroded) was replaced by a concrete arch in 1937-39 * Floodlighting was installed by Sydney electricity on 1992 * Safety fencing was installed on the bridge in 2010  Heritage listing  The bridge is intimately associated with the residential development of the area to the north of the bridge, essential infrastructure which allowed its development to proceed in the late nineteenth century. The concrete arch which was built 1936-9 is a fascinating episode in the bridge's history. The process of the design and construction of the arch is illustrative of an era in the history of bridge building in the Department of Main Roads. It is linked with the local historical theme of engineering and building the road system. The use of the concrete arch solution to support the older bridge and to allow its landmark features to be retained was a creative and heritage-sensitive response to an infrastructure problem in an era long before heritage values and processes were enshrined in legislation.

It seemingly belongs to the cultural areas of Anatolia (Asia Minor) and Mesopotamia.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 It is described in detail in the pseudonymous chronicle of Joshua the Stylite (6th century).Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 The chronicle reports that the earthquake was preceded by a plague of locusts. The earthquake reportedly took place in September. During the earthquake, \\"a great sound\\" was reportedly heard from the heaven over the land. The earth trembled, and all nearby villages and towns felt the earthquake and heard the accompanying sound.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 The earthquake was accompanied with alarming rumors from various locations. Omens (\\"signs) were reported from the Euphrates, and the hot spring of Avarne. The \\"waters which flowed from their fountains\\" were dried up in the day of the earthquake. The chronicler mentions that it was typical for running waters to be restrained by earthquakes, or their flow to be diverted to other locations.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 A letter reported that the city of Nicopolis had collapsed in ruins at midnight, and that its inhabitants were buried in the ruins. The report of the letter was confirmed to the chronicler by travelers who returned from Nicopolis. The defensive walls of Nicopolis had collapsed, along with every building within the city.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 According to the chronicler, there were only three survivors. They were the bishop of Nicopolis and two of his companions. The trio were sleeping behind the apse of a church's altar. When the ceiling of their room collapsed, \\"one end of its beams\\" was stopped by the altar's wall. The trio were consequently not buried under the collapsed ceiling.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 The chronicler mentions one of his own acquaintances who left the city shortly before the earthquake, at the insistence of a restless companion. The two men had slept in a cave outside Nicopolis. They returned in the morning and discovered the disaster.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 According to this supposed eyewitness, the casualties did not include only human residents. The city's cattle, oxen, and camels were trapped beneath the ruins.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 The bishop of Nicopolis was rescued by unnamed visitors to the city, who found him underneath the ceiling's beams. The bishop asked them for bread and wine, with the intention to celebrate the Eucharist. However, they could not find bread and wine in the ruins.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 In Arsamosata, there was a \\"strongly built\\" and \\"beautifully decorated\\" church. The locals were scared by thunder and lightning prior to the earthquake, and had fled to this church. They hoped that local relics (the \\"bones of the saints\\") would protect them. The church collapsed at midnight, due to the earthquake. Most of the people within were crushed to death.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 A shorter description of the earthquake is given by the chronicler Marcellinus Comes (6th century), who reports that the earthquake affected the Roman province of Pontus. The Chronicle of Edessa (6th century), reports the great tremor of the earthquake. According to this chronicle, the hot spring of Abarne remained dried up for three days. It also reports the collapse of Nicopolis, and the survival of the local bishop and two of his attendants.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 The historian Theophanes the Confessor (8th century) instead dates this earthquake to Anno Mundi 5995, equivalent to Anno Domini 502 and 503.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 Theophanes reports a supposed miracle at Neocaesarea which was connected to this earthquake. A soldier who was walking alone near the city, met two unknown (to him) soldiers, and a person who was instructing them to protect the house containing the tomb of Gregory. When the earthquake struck, the church of Gregory Thaumaturgus was one of the few buildings in Neocaesarea which did not collapse. Theophanes attributes this to divine protection.Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 A Syrian chronicle dating to 819, also records this earthquake. It misdates the earthquake to the year 470. A chronicle attributed to Dionysius I Telmaharoyo (9th century), dates the same earthquake to the year 503, and places it in Mesopotamia. The historian Samuel Anetsi (12th century) dates the earthquake to the year 510. There is also a mention of this earthquake by the chronicler Michael the Syrian (12th century).Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 Arsamosata was also known as Arsameia. Arsameia and the hot springs of Abarne were both located in the Kingdom of Commagene. The Nicopolis mentioned was probably located in Euphratensis, and may be different than the Nicopolis of Pontus, or the Nicopolis of Palestine (also known as Emmaus Nicopolis).Guidoboni, Traina, 1995 References Sources * Category:499 Category:490s in the Byzantine Empire Category:5th- century earthquakes Category:5th century in Armenia Category:Earthquakes in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"499 Nicopolis earthquake"},{"id":"61912590","text":"Hilarempis cillata is a species of dance flies, in the fly family Empididae.

It concerns 25 Norwegian men in a men's choir rehearsing for their biggest event ever: warming up for Black Sabbath in front of 10,000 people. But there are problems backstage as Ivar, the conductor, is terminally ill, and might not live to experience the concert. The film has won international awards after its release. The international premiere was at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen 24 March 2019 where it won the NORDIC:DOX AWARD for best Nordic documentary film.

In Denmark, the film had it's theatrical release on 17 October 2019 under the name \\"Mandskoret\\"(The men's choir) and is distributed by Camera film. Production The documentary format used is a mixture of interviews and \\"fly on the wall\\" coverage that includes a number of musical recitations. The focus is on the choir members themselves and does not delve too deeply into their private family life. Critical reception In her review for Norwegian film magazine Kinomagasinest, Torunn Sala gave The Men's Room five stars from six, praising the direction and production as natural, unobtrusive and successfully capturing compassion and humour. Meredith Taylor, reviewing for Filmuphoria, praised the lack of sentimentality, the quiet humour and emotional expression. She commented that the film:\\" ... glows with a low key charm so redolent of its North European origins ... \\". Clare Martin of Radio 13 New Zealand praised the film's naturalism while desiring a more detailed conclusion. She noted that: \\" ... Without needing to add in quirky camera angles or extreme close-ups, there is clarity and storytelling in every frame...\\".  Awards and nominations  * ¬´Best European Documentary¬ª, 10.

Life and work  Garcia was born in 1991 in Camden Town, London to a Guyanese mother, a former civil servant, and a British Trinidadian filmmaker father, the youngest of four siblings. Her uncle is John R. Rickford, who is the J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of Linguistics and the Humanities at Stanford University. Garcia followed her three older siblings to the local Saturday music center at the age of 5, where she first learned the violin and later played the viola in the London Schools Symphony Orchestra (LSSO). Garcia has said her home life with her stepdad, a brass player with a vast collection of instruments, and her mother a keen collector of all genres of music from reggae and Latin to classical and soul, coupled with the music activities at school, Camden School for Girls, meant she was saturated with music of all genres. Garcia began learning the saxophone at the age of 10, with Vicky Wright. She became a member of the Camden Jazz Band, directed by jazz pianist Nikki Yeoh, before joining the junior jazz program at the Royal Academy of Music. She also attended the workshops of Tomorrow's Warriors under the direction of Gary Crosby. While still in high school, she received a scholarship for a five-week summer program at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. During her gap year she studied with former Jazz Messengers member, Jean Toussaint. In 2016 she graduated with honours from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, in Jazz Performance. In 2017, Garcia released her debut EP Nubya's 5ive via the label Jazz re:freshed. That year, her band was an opening act at Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festival in S√®te; the following year she played at the NYC Winter Jazz Festival and the JazzFest Berlin. In her 2018 EP When We Are, Garcia explored how electronics can be used in a live jazz environment; the EP was created with the support of the Steve Reid InNOVAtion Award, a development project between PRS Foundation and Steve Reid Foundation. She is also a member of the collective N√©rija and the Afro-jazz ensemble Maisha. In addition, she is a collaborator on albums by Makaya McCraven, Theon Cross, Moses Boyd, and Sons of Kemet to Shabaka Hutchings; contributions from her can be found on five tracks of Brownswoods We Out Here, a sampler album from the modern London jazz scene. Garcia tours internationally, in Europe, India, Australia, and North America. She regularly performs at festivals in the UK including Love Supreme Jazz Festival and NN North Sea Jazz Festival. She has headlined sell-out shows at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. Garcia also has a burgeoning reputation as a DJ, with a monthly radio residency on NTS Radio since November 2017. Garcia was supposed to perform at the Glastonbury Festival, which had to be cancelled due to the increasing concerns over the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic.

The biography published in 2009, on the other hand, mentions 15 February 1813 as the date of birth and 22 January 1870 as the date of death.) was an Austrian operatic mezzo-soprano. She lived as a singing teacher in Munich and Stuttgart.  Life and career  Schebest was born in Vienna, the daughter of a Czech-born chief of the Austrian army. She moved to Prague as a child with her parents due to a professional change in her father's assignment. The latter died as a result of an injury while blasting the fortifications of Alessandria as early as 1816. She lived with her mother in Terezin, where she attracted attention as a child at church concerts. At the age of eleven she got singing lessons free of charge with Kammers√§nger Johann Aloys Miksch and acting lessons with the actress Friederike Vohs in Dresden. At the Dresden court opera she sang early as choirist and comprimaria. Schebest made her opera debut in 1830 as Benjamin in M√©hul's Joseph at the Dresden court stage. As a result she got a job there, which enabled her to take care financially of her family. Other roles included Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio, Rebecca in Marschner's Der Templer und die J√ºdin, Sesto in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito and Alice in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable. At that time Wilhelmine Schr√∂der-Devrient also worked in Dresden and she was deeply impressed by her work. After two years she terminated the Dresden contract, which also obliged her to act, because she feared that voice training could suffer under the speaking roles. After successful guest appearances in Berlin and Leipzig, she accepted an invitation to the stage in Budapest in spring 1832 where she was under contract until 1836. There she had successes as Agathe in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz, Emmeline in Joseph Weigl's Die Schweizer Familie, Zerline in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Desdemona in Rossini's Otello, in the title role of Cherubini's M√©d√©e and especially as Romeo in Bellini's I Capuleti ed i Montecchi. In 1834 and 1835 she made guest tours to Vienna, Dresden and Graz. After the end of her engagement in Budapest, she gave guest performances at the leading German opera houses from 1836 to 1841. At this time she had her residence in Nuremberg. After a stay in Paris she travelled Italy in 1841 with performances in Trieste and Venice. Afterwards she came to Weimar, Schwerin, Warsaw, Lemberg, Munich and finally to Karlsruhe in June 1842. She ended her career because she had married the theologian and biographer David Friedrich Strau√ü. The marriage, which produced two children, was unhappy and ended in divorce after a few years. Schebest died in Stuttgart at age 56.  Publications  * Aus dem Leben einer K√ºnstlerin Stuttgart: Ebner & Seubert, 1857 (Google-Digitalisat) * Rede und Geberde.

A member of the Catholic-centrist Bavarian People's Party (\\"Bayerische Volkspartei\\" / BVP), and with women now permitted to stand for election, in 1919 she became one of a number of women elected to what became known as the Weimar National Assembly, mandated to draw up a republican constitution for a newly post-imperial Germany. She also served, for more than forty years, as Secretary for Bavaria of the German Catholic Women's Association (\\"Katholischer Deutscher Frauenbund\\" / KDFB). Biography =Provenance and early years= Marie Zettler was born in Mering a short distance outside Augsburg in western Bavaria, the seventh of ten recorded children of Ludwig, a ceramics creaftsman, and Josefine Zettler. Her parents were committed Catholics and she was educated according to firm religious principles. Her youthful enthusiasms extended widely, taking in Music, the Natural Sciences, Literature and the Arts. Given the religious context of her upbrining she was naturally also interested in Theology and Philosophy. In 1889 she was enrolled at an Educational Establishment in Pasing (Munich) which was unusual in that it was headed up by English women. After three years she returned home to her family where she helped look after the household, educate her younger siblings and support her father's business on the administrative side. Typical of women's rights activists during this period was her intense appetite for education. In 1911 she teamed up with her long standing life partner Marie Buczkowska to attend a two-month further education teaching course in M√∂nchen-Gladbach on Popular Economics for Catholic Germany. She subsequently undertook a training in social work at the (Catholic Social- Charity Women's Academy Munich) that had been set up by Ellen Ammann of the BVP. Zettler was elected Secretary for Bavaria of the German Catholic Women's Association on 1 January 1912. She would hold the position for more than forty years. She was one of many who backed Cardinal (as he became in 1917) Michael von Faulhaber's vision for an association of members in religious orders, but without any standardised form or religious dress. The underlying point was to open up the ideals of the religious order to the secular world. Marie Zettler worked within this \\"Societas Religiosa\\" as a schooling head. Alongside these tasks and her KDFB responsibilities she served on the executive committee of the \\"Association of German Catholic Women Social Administrators\\" (\\"Verein katholischer deutscher Sozialbeamtinnen e.V. \\"). =German (\\"Weimar\\") Republic 1919‚Äì1933= In February 1919 Marie Zettler was one of six women from the Catholic Centre Party and its Bavarian affiliate to become of the Weimar National Assembly. Zettler represented the \\"Upper Bavaria and Schwabing\\" A focus of her interests in the assembly was the question of childcare. She advocated the strengthening of the family because she believed that a healthy and happy family life was key to good childcare. Weimar was not a large town and there was a desperate shortage of living accommodation for the 423 delegates from across Germany, together with staff support and press reporters, called upon to relocate to Weimar in early 1919. Some delegates ended up taking lodgings in Erfurt or Jena and commuting to Weimar. It is not entirely clear where Marie Zettler lived at this time, but it is thought that she stayed in a shared apartment. When the National Assembly made way for Weimar Germany's first parliament (Reichstag) in June 1920 she did not put herself forward as a candidate in the 1920 general election, preferring to devote herself full-time to church-focused journalism. Alongside her more directly political work Marie Zettler edited \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\" (loosely, \\"Bavarian Women's World\\") between 1919 and 1941. This was a newly established (in 1919) magazine produced by the KDFB. As well as editing the magazine she included her own contributions about her parliamentary and political work. In 1924 she also took on responsibility for the calendar produced annually for the KDFB. Her contributions did not go unappreciated by the Vatican. In December 1928 a letter arrived from Cardinal Dr. Gasparri containing thanks and commendation for the calendar that her partner Maria Buczkowska had sent the Holy Father.H. Weber: Marie Zettler. In: Frauenland. edition 5/6, 1950, pp 90‚Äì91. =Dictatorship 1933‚Äì1945= During the Hitler years Marie Zettler is described as \\"extremely reserved\\" (\\"√§u√üerst zur√ºckhaltend\\") in at least one source. On the other hand, when war broke out six years after the National Socialist take-over, she used the magazine to urge women to make use of the weapons available to them: * \\"Weapons of the spirit, soul and heart are women's weapons. They are unconquerable! These are the weapons that women must take up in the present wartime conditions. Their renown will bloom today as in days of old. The obligation of loyalty is the first weapon. The obligations of war are obligations of honour that fall upon women no less than the fall on men. They are hard obligations, to see husbands and sons ready to make the ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield, that can be borne with courage only by raising our eyes to God, without whose will nothing can happen. He mysteriously prepares the path for each of us, whether in war or in peace.\\"Marie Zettler: Waffen des Starkmutes. in \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\" Nr. 5, 1940. The National Socialists took a close interest in enyone who had been a member of the nationanl parliament during the \\"Weimar\\" years: both as a former member of the Weimar National Assembly and on account of her expressly Catholic Christian work, Zettler was kept under surtveillance by the authorities. Marie Buczkowska wrote a biography in which she recalled that her partner's mail was monitored and that they were subjected to house searches. Zettler was often called in to the Gestapo main office in Munich to discuss articles in \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\".M. Buczkowska: Marie Zettler. Ein Leben f√ºr die Wohlfahrtspflege, Politik und Katholische Frauenbewegung. Mering 1950. In a biographical contribution published in 2004 Johann Weber contextualised Buczkowska's reports for a new generation: :\\"You can look as much as you want, but the National Socialists did not have much against her. So there is not conclusive evidence of reprisals such as apartment searches or monitoring of mail. An interrogation session at the Gestapo main office in the Wittelsbach Palace does seem likely, however.\\"J. Weber: Maria Zettler. Ein Leben f√ºr den Frauenbund. Mering 2004. In June 1941 production of the \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\" came to an end, on the flimsy reasoning that \\"people and raw materials needed to be freed up for important war objectives\\". Marie Zettler provided readers with the following message of valediction: * \\"This edition of \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\" comes to you with a heartfelt 'farewell' to all our dear readers. The paper supplies section of the has informed us that the war economy demands fullest concentration of resources. Circumstances have come together that make it necessary for our magazine to be withdrawn from now until further notice so that people and raw materials can be freed up for important war objectives.\\"Marie Zettler: \\"Bayerisches Frauenland\\", 1941. p.1 In December 1944 Marie Zettler and her partner Marie Buczkowska, together with the latter's sister Valentine, relocated back to Mering after their Munich apartment was bombed out. =After the war 1945‚Äì1950= Following the collapse of Hitler's Germany Bavaria found itself administered, till May 1949, as part of the American zone of occupation: Zettler made a start on rebuilding the KDFB. In January 1949 a KDFB magazine appeared in the form of a supplement to the publication \\"Katholische Frau\\", and Zettler once again took charge of the supplement's editorial operation. It might have been the start of a more substantial project, but Marie Zettler's failing health left her unable to participate in the publication's further developments. She was suffering from an acute form of Rheumatism, identified in sources as \\"Gelenkrheumatismus\\" and died shortly afterwards at Mering, which is where her body was buried. Helene Weber paid tribute to her as \\"the [very] soul of the Catholic Women's Movement in Bavaria\\".

It was established by a group of UK scientists in Malta in 1966 to assist in the organisation and publication of British diving science. Membership grew to over 400, with approximately one third joining from outside the UK. From 1972 to 1979 the UA published a Code of Practice for scientific diving. This was expanded in 1987 and 1990 to form the UNESCO Code of practice. Membership declined in the late 1980s, and the UA merged with the Society for Underwater Technology in 1992. Background The Underwater Association grew out of the popularity of scuba sports diving clubs in British universities in the 1950s and 60s. Diving became popular after the introduction of the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba set, the Aqua-Lung, in the 1940s, and clubs were established in many British universities from 1957 onwards. Members of these clubs, and of research institutions, used scuba diving to pursue various scientific projects under water. Some projects involved the study of diver physiology and psychology, while others made use of diving to study marine biology, underwater archaeology, geology, physics and other topics. Members of the Cambridge University Underwater Exploration Group and Imperial College London were particularly active. They ran expeditions to Malta in the early 1960s, and enjoyed close cooperation with the Royal Navy which provided compressed air and a recompression chamber. In 1965 five different scientific diving teams were active in Malta. The different teams were organised as follows: The Cambridge University Malta Expedition 1965, an undergraduate group studying diurnal behaviour in marine invertebrates (winners of the first ever Duke of Edinburgh/British Sub-Aqua Club award for diving science); and a group from Oxford University, studying mainly algae and geology. There was also a Vision Group from various institutions, studying the visibility of underwater objects and the perception of size and distance, a group led by John Woods from the Physics Department Imperial College London studying thermocline instability; and a Helium Group, led by Nic Flemming from Cambridge University, studying the psychological and ergonomic efficiency of divers breathing heliox and air at a depth of 60 m. In total, 32 divers were involved in these projects. The groups shared many facilities and a conference was organised to present the results in late 1965, with the papers published in 1966. After this publication, the group established an association as a company limited by guarantee and which was registered as a charitable organization. Establishment of the Underwater Association The Underwater Association for Malta 1966 was established under that name in 1966 to assist in the organisation and publication of British diving science. The first organising committee consisted of John N. Lythgoe (Institute of Ophthalmology, London), John D. Woods (Physics Department, Imperial College, London), Nicholas C. Flemming (Pembroke College, Cambridge), Anthony Larkum (Botany, Cambridge), Andrew E. Dorey (Zoology, Bristol), Christopher C. \\"Bill\\" Hemmings (Fisheries Laboratory, Aberdeen). Bill Hemmings was appointed the first Chair. Subsequent Chairs were Nic Flemming, John Lythgoe and Richard Pagett. As the Association expanded and broadened its range of international recruitment, the name was shortened to the Underwater Association. After a few years the use of Malta as a central base for multiple projects was abandoned, and the Association expanded its objectives to promote underwater science at any location, attracting one third of its membership from outside the UK. The Underwater Association corresponded and collaborated with equivalent voluntary bodies in other countries, especially the American Academy of Underwater Sciences in the USA. The methods and goals of the Underwater Association helped equivalent bodies to develop in South Africa and Australia. Symposia and UA publications The UA held its first symposium in 1965 to discuss the results of that year‚Äôs expeditions. It took place in the Physics Department of Imperial College London, on 29th October. The resulting papers, and those of symposia from 1966‚Äì69, were published in booklet form. The proceedings volumes were reviewed in maritime research journals for the information of other marine scientists. Woods and Lythgoe in 1971 and Drew, Lythgoe and Woods in 1976 also published books on underwater science with contributions from members of the UA and elsewhere. The Association also published a newsletter several times each year, circulated by post, which was an essential component of its success in the days before digital communications. Edward Drew and Helen Ross were newsletter editors for much of this time. Copies of most of the UA publications on the proceedings of symposia are held by the library of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Typical publications in different disciplines The Underwater Association provided a vehicle for marine scientists who used diving to pool experiences, learn different techniques, experiment with different breathing gas mixtures and diving gear, and to publish their results in a way that emphasised the effectiveness of diving, as well as the skills needed to work efficiently underwater. This achievement coexisted with routine publishing in the mainstream single- discipline refereed journals that demonstrate the high quality of the research. Published papers by Members in the Proceedings volumes and other academic journals included research on diving medicine, psychology, marine biology, fisheries, marine geology, marine physics, archaeology, and oceanographic engineering. The Underwater Association enabled many young marine scientists to develop their careers at a time when diving was not a common research method. The following selected citations illustrate some significant papers in the disciplines of Marine Physics, Psychology of perception, Geoarchaeology, Archaeology, Marine botany, Marine algae, Marine zoology, the psychology of memory in different environments, and diving physiology. Role in development of UK Codes of Practice for Scientific Diving During the early 1970s there were increasing numbers of accidents to divers operating commercially in the North Sea oil fields. The UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) published a consultative document on proposed new regulations for divers at work in 1978, and new statutory regulations came into force in 1981. These were updated in 1997. The Underwater Association, whose members had an accident-free safety record, published an advisory Code of Practice for Scientific Diving in 1972, which was revised and updated in 1974, after which it was adopted as the standard for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and other governmental research diving organisations. This code was circulated internationally, which led to the convening of a UNESCO committee of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, whose purpose was to publish an international version, compatible with the safety laws in many countries. NERC, a UK government agency which employed marine scientists in several institutes, adopted the UA Code of Practice and co- published it through several editions (Code in references).The Royal Geographical Society Expedition Advisory Centre recommended the UA Code for use in diving research projects (Palmer).The UA Code helped in the negotiations with the HSE, firstly to obtain Exemptions for Scientific Diving (HSE), and later to create new regulations for specialised diving groups through supervisory Approved Codes of Practice such as the Scientific and archaeological diving projects: Diving at work regulations 1997. The negotiations on safety also led to the formation of the Scientific Diving Supervisory Committee as an advisory body for UK governmental research groups. Reciprocal standards of training and safety for scientific diving were also agreed throughout European agencies and national bodies. Merger with the Society for Underwater Technology The Underwater Association performed a vital role in the early stages of scientific diving, but ceased to function in 1992. The situation had changed since the 1960s, when it was very difficult for diving scientists to share expertise, and scientific papers in narrow- discipline journals seldom mentioned the use of diving. Before the days of digital search engines, it was hard to assess the scope of underwater observations, or to learn from the experimental techniques of other researchers. The best way to develop underwater research was to organise national and international meetings, and to publish the proceedings. When digital media and citation indices increased, academics preferred to publish in journals specific to their own disciplines rather than in general diving publications, and they did not need to attend meetings devoted to diving science. Diving for research purposes had become a common practice. As membership declined, a merger with the Society for Underwater Technology (SUT) was organised by John Bevan.

History Following the move away from steam haulage on Czechoslovak railways, it was decided that heating of passenger cars would move from steam heat, where steam from a boiler is piped through the train, to electric train heat. To convert the locomotives to the 749 class, the steam boiler was removed, and replaced with an alternator to provide electric train supply for heating. This process also took place with the locomotives of the ƒåD Class 753, which were converted to the 750 class. The prototype for the conversion took place in 1992, with locomotive 751 039 being converted, with a second locomotive being converted in 1993. Following these two, 60 locomotives were converted, with the process being carried out until 1996. The final locomotive was additionally modified with a new electrical control system. The locomotives chosen to be converted were selected from all production series, therefore the new numbers do not form a continuous series. Especially after 2005 the locomotives were increasingly used in freight transport, mainly to replace the aging unrebuilt 751 and 753 classes, and due to increasing electrification rendering the diesel locomotives obsolete. In 2007, several locomotives were transferred to ƒåD Cargo, following the separation from ƒåesk√© dr√°hy. =Current operations= Today the remaining freight locomotives are based around ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, where they are used when freight trains are diverted away from the wires. At ƒåesk√© dr√°hy several locomotives are still operational at Prague's Vr≈°ovice depot, working weekend services to ƒåerƒçany. Technical Information Class 749 is a dual cab, four axle locomotive.

Life Ludwig Winder was born in 1889 in ≈†afov in Moravia, Austria-Hungary, the son of a Jewish family, but grew up in nearby Hole≈°ov, where he was brought up in a strictly religious atmosphere. In 1906 he published his first poetry book at his own expense. After moving to Vienna in 1907 he worked for the liberal newspaper Die Zeit after completing his matriculation examination before joining the editorial staff of the nationalist Deutsche Zeitung Bohemia in Prague. He belonged to the so-called \\"Prague Circle\\" of writers which included Franz Kafka and was a close friend of the journalist and philosopher Felix Weltsch and the writers Oskar Baum, Max Brod, Johannes Urzidil and Ilse Aichinger.Ludwig Winder - Jewish Virtual LibraryGlenda Abramson, Ludwig Winder - Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, Routledge, Vol 1, (2005) pgs. 956-957Wolfgang M√ºller-Funk, The Architecture of Modern Culture: Towards a Narrative Cultural Theory, Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin (2012) - Google Books pg. 260 He worked for various newspapers as an editor, literary critic, local journalist, theatre lecturer, etc. Between 1915 and 1938 he wrote over 2,500 feature articles for the newspaper Deutsche Zeitung Bohemia in Prague. In 1917 Winder published his first novel, Die rasende Rotationsmaschine which examined the difficulties faced by Jews from religious eastern communities in integrating themselves into modern western society. His semi-autobiographical novels Die juedische Orgel (1922) and Hugo: Tragoedie eines Knaben (1924) concern the battle of young eastern Jews for a secular existence.C. Spirek, in: Exil 17 (1997), 45‚Äì55 His play The Woman Without Qualities was used by Robert Musil as a model for his opus magnum Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften.

The story of the Jew Albert, who grows up in the Jewish ghetto of a small town in Moravia takes up the classical themes of romanticism such as the fight against the father and self- realization through detachment from the family.

His philosophical works are in the areas of metaphysics, reason, philosophy of technology, philosophy of politics, and secrecy. Mohan's works are based on the principle of anastasis (or resurrection) which holds that philosophy is an ever-present possibility. Life Mohan completed his early education in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, and studied philosophy at St. Stephen's College, Delhi where he taught for some time. He has academic degrees in economics and philosophy. He has written philosophical essays against the rise of Hindu nationalism in The Indian Express, Mediapart, Outlook, La Croix, The Wire, Le Monde and Lib√©ration. Philosophical work Shaj Mohan has published in the areas of metaphysics, reason, nature, secrecy, philosophy of technology, and philosophy of politics. His work combines the formalism and argumentation of analytic philosophy with the intuitive exegetical style of continental philosophy. Mohan is credited with having \\"created a new voice in philosophy\\" but \\"one can't help hear in it the voice of prophesy\\". Mohan said that it is possible to practice philosophy without anchoring it to any tradition. Mohan said the practice of philosophy is seen as dangerous for \\"the decadent components of the present\\" and that invites danger to the philosopher. He said \\"The danger of philosophy comes through the erotic relation with the future, and what can be called ‚Äòthe eternal‚Äô, which constitutes the being of the philosopher\\". In a conversation with Barbara Cassin Mohan said that the concept of voice in philosophy is made possible by the fundamental freedom of the question \\"what do you think?\\". He argued that reason has an important role in philosophy in spite of the criticisms of it in the 20th century. Reason exceeds mechanical thinking as it has a relation to \\"the obscure\\". Mohan wrote the book Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics published by Bloomsbury Academic, UK with the philosopher Divya Dwivedi. Jean-Luc Nancy wrote the foreword to Gandhi and Philosophy and described the originality this work in terms of the relation shown by it between truth and suffering. Dwivedi and Mohan stated it as \\"in direct proportion to the exposure [of Truth] there is suffering, and in direct proportion to un-truth there is liveable life\\". Nancy wrote that this work creates the new beginning for philosophy following the end of metaphysics, = Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics = M. K. Gandhi in 1909 According to Jean-Luc Nancy Gandhi and Philosophy leads to a new orientation outside of the theological, metaphysical and nihilistic tendencies in philosophy. Bernard Stiegler said that this work \\"give us to reconsider the history of nihilism in the eschatological contemporaneity and shows its ultimate limits\\" and offers a new path. Gandhi and Philosophy calls this new beginning the anastasis of philosophy. Robert Bernasconi said that the inventiveness and the constructivism behind the concept of ana-stasis, or the overcoming of stasis, has a relation to the project of re-beginning of philosophy by Heidegger. Gandhi and Philosophy proposed that parallel to the metaphysical tendency in philosophy there is hypophysics. Hypophysics is defined as \\"a conception of nature as value\\". Mohan said \\"This non- philosophical system, which we call hypophysics, is necessarily interesting for philosophy. \\" The distance from nature that human beings and natural objects come to have through the effects of technology lessens their value, or brings them closer to evil. Gandhi's concept of passive force or nonviolence is an implication of his hypophysical commitment to nature. The philosophical direction outside of metaphysics and hypophysics is created through the invention of a new conceptual order. It is meant to enable philosophy to step outside the regime of sign, signifier, and text. The Book Review said that the philosophical project of Gandhi and Philosophy is to create new evaluative categories, \\"the authors, in engaging with Gandhi's thought, create their categories, at once descriptive and evaluative\\" while pointing to the difficulty given by the rigour of a \\"A seminal if difficult read for those with an appetite for philosophy\\". Some of these conceptual inventions have been noted to have come from mathematics and biology. The Indian Express found that one of these inventions is Scalology. Scalology is the practice of using a scale, such as speed or size, to measure the moral state of a political or social system. Gandhi used the scale of speed to measure moral values because for him transporting oneself by foot would be more virtuous compared to taking a train which is effectively treating \\"slow\\" as good and \\"quick\\" as evil. The constructionist tendency of Gandhi and Philosophy places it between the dominant philosophical styles of continental philosophy and analytical philosophy. The conclusion of Gandhi and Philosophy emphasizes the construction of a new dimension in philosophy.  Reception  Jean-Luc Nancy, Robert Bernasconi, Bernard Stiegler and Robert J. C. Young said that his work creates new possibilities for philosophy beyond the impasse of metaphysics and nihilism. Mohan's work on Gandhi was criticised from the point of view methodological and stylistic difficulty. Robert Bernasconi noted that Gandhi and Philosophy is a difficult book and it is \\"not a book that you will understand at first reading\\". The difficulty due to the constructivist style was noted by other authors as well. Tridip Suhrud pointed to the \\"opacity\\" of style in The Hindu and explained it as the effect of \\"reflections on language\\". Gandhi and Philosophy was criticised from the point of view of the recent mounting criticisms of Gandhi in India and internationally. It was said that Gandhi and Philosophy might be exalting Gandhi while being very critical of him at the same time. The ambiguous approach to Gandhi was described in one of the commentaries in The Indian Express as \\"Mohan and Dwivedi have done a masterful job of avoiding the binary fork ‚Äì hagiography or vituperation ‚Äì as much of Gandhi and hagiography comes from a need to spiritualise Gandhi\\". Economic and Political Weekly pointed to Mohan and Dwivedi's participation in the paradigm of \\"western philosophy\\", especially when Gandhi's goal was to create an alternative to Eurocentrism. EPW said that his work may be of interest only to continental philosophy as she does not participate in Indic discourses. In The Indian Express Aakash Joshi commented on the negative implications of Gandhi and Philosophy and said that through this book \\"Gandhi can be seen as a nihilist ‚Äì someone who even decries sex for reproduction and would like human society to wither away.\\" Joshi stressed that this point of view is opposed to \\"secularism of a particular kind, freedom from colonial concepts, caste without violence\\".

She arrivied in England in 1912, already a competent painter. In the 1920s, she painted portraits for the front covers of several issues of The Sketch, and The Bystander, working mainly in crayon & watercolour. During this period, she made two visits to the United States, making use of introductions made by Sir Joseph Duveen at the behest of Oswald Birley. Her subjects included American celebrities such as Tallulah Bankhead and Amelia Earhart, and their British equivalents, such as Madeleine Carroll and Cathleen Nesbitt. Her portrait of Agatha Christie was used on the cover of Agatha Christie: An Autobiography. Watercolours of pilots by Olive Snell During World War II, she turned to military subjects, including Battle of Britain pilots, as an official war artist attached to the Royal Air Force. Her 1943 painting of pilots of 610 Squadron at RAF Westhampnett is now in the Goodwood collection on the same site. Four of the eighteen pilots depicted were killed within months of its completion. The War Artists' Advisory Committee issued her with a permit to sketch in public during wartime. She married Ebenezer John Lecky Pike, CBE, MC (1884-1965), an officer (later a colonel) in the Grenadier Guards, on 16 April 1913. They had four children, the youngest of whom, David Ebenezer (born 9 June 1925), a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, was killed in action on 5 March 1945 and is buried at Reichswald Forest War Cemetery. Their eldest child, Helena Christian, married Lionel Brett, 4th Viscount Esher. The middle daughter Katherine Mary Penelope married Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland. A third daughter, Jane Rosemary (1923-1934), died in childhood. She exhibited at the Fine Art Society, Grosvenor Gallery, New English Art Club, Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Society of Women Artists. Her works are in public collections, including the Imperial War Museums and Royal Air Force Museum. Her portrait was painted in 1922 by Oswald Birley. As of 2017, the picture was in private ownership. Birley subsequently painted Ebenezer Pike, and later married Pike's sister, Rhoda, after painting her also. Another portrait was painted circa 1927 by Augustus John. This work was sold by Boningtons in June 2018. The Illustrated London News noted in 1927, that Snell \\"was lucky enough to have some lessons from that celebrated artist Augustus John, who was interested in her work\\".

He was manager of the Pacific operations of the German enterprise. His mother Rosetta Albertina was sister to Eduard and Franz Hernsheim, the founders of Hernsheim & Co.

Ethnographic collections  An important business for him and Hernsheim & Co was ethnographic collections. He soon realised that there was much money in those collections and they were easy to sell to various travellers in the region. He stockpiled such collections at his house on Matupi but they were often poorly labeled and lacked proper categorisation, place of origin, natives name etc. In 1902 Thiel hired Franz Hellwig, a former employee of the Deutsche Handels- und Plantagengesellschaft to assist him in his collecting.

History The building was commissioned to replace an earlier town hall on the site built in 1730. The new building, which was designed by Sir Robert Smirke, was completed in 1837. It was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Salop County Council. The local borough guildhall (i.e. borough council meeting place) was incorporated into the shirehall under a long-standing arrangement which pre- dated Smirke's structure. The borough council moved out to Newport House in Dogpole in 1917 leaving the county council on their own. After the county council moved to the new Shirehall in Abbey Foregate in 1966, it was demolished to make way for a new retail and commercial facility known as Princess House in 1971.

He sat in the Irish House of Commons from 1767 to 1772, and was then appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). He was also Usher and Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery (Ireland). In his capacity as Accountant-General he was accused of illegally enriching himself, and the charge of corruption is believed to have led to his committing suicide in 1794. Career  He was born in County Tipperary, the son of John Power of Barretstown. He entered the Middle Temple in 1752, was called to the Irish Bar in 1757 and took silk in 1768. He was granted an honorary doctorate of law by the University of Dublin in 1769. He entered the House of Commons as MP for Monaghan in 1767, and sat as member for Tuam from 1768 to 1772. He was a highly intelligent man and an able pamphleteer; but his manner was eccentric and his speeches in Parliament were often so badly phrased that they provoked derisive laughter from his critics. He became second Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1772. Disgrace  His highly successful career came to a tragic end in 1794, as a result of his alleged misconduct as Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery, a post he had been appointed to in 1763, and continued to hold after he became a judge. The position entitled him to have personal charge of all funds lodged in the Court of Chancery in pending lawsuits. A lengthy case concerning the Chandos family having been concluded, the successful party to the lawsuit claimed the interest on the sum due to him, estimated at ¬£3000, a small fortune at the time. Power declined to pay the interest, saying that the claimant was only entitled to the principal sum, and that he himself was entitled to retain the interest. The claimant appealed to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare. The Chancellor took a serious view of the matter, and ordered Power to appear personally before him to account for his conduct. Power strongly objected to the order, saying that it was beneath his dignity to answer to another judge, particularly one who though technically senior to him in rank had not even been called to the Bar when Power became a judge. The Chancellor was inflexible, and gave Power five days to appear before him. Rumours began to circulate that Power had accumulated his considerable fortune by improperly retaining other funds in a similar fashion. Suicide  Power had always been eccentric (his opponents in the House of Commons had often accused him of talking in the House like a \\"Bedlamite\\" or lunatic), and the fear of disgrace, and of his possible removal from the Bench, was generally believed to have preyed on his mind to the point where he became mentally unstable. A wild rumour circulated that he tried but failed to murder the Lord Chancellor. The story seems to have no foundation, but the fact that it was told at all may be some indication of the state of Power's mental health at the end of his life. He was found drowned in the River Liffey at Irishtown early in 1794. The inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death (thus entitling him to a Christian burial, which was forbidden to a suicide), but no contemporary doubted that it was actually a case of suicide. Whether by honest means or not he had acquired a large fortune, which passed to his nephew. Sources *The Annual Register for the Year 1794 *Ball, F.

Muminov was the organizer and first director of the Institute of Philosophy and Law of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek SSR (1958‚Äì1959). Muminov owns more than 200 publications on various issues of philosophy and history. He was a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Uzbek SSR (4 convocations). Muminov from 1966 to 1974 was chairman of the standing commission on foreign affairs of the Supreme Council of the Uzbek SSR. Muminov was among the main organizers of the first All-Union Conference of Orientalists in Tashkent, which was held in July 1957. Orientalists from all over the Soviet Union, as well as China, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Romania took part in it.Kirasirova M., \\"Sons of Muslims\\" in Moscow: Soviet Central Asian mediators to the foreign East, 1955‚Äì1962 in Ab Imperio, 4,2011, p.118 In 1960, Muminov led the Uzbek delegation at the XXV International Congress of Orientalists in Moscow. I. Muminov in the conditions of liberalization of the post-Stalin era tried to organizationally implement the unrealized plans of his teachers: V. Vyatkin, P. Saliev, M. Saidzhanov to study the rich history of Samarkand. On the initiative of I. Muminov in 1964, it was decided to create a museum in Samarkand for his teacher S. Aini. In 1967, the museum was inaugurated. In the 1960s, I. Muminov, with the support of Sh. Rashidov, developed the idea of a broad study of the history of higher education - the system of madrassas in Samarkand. It was planned to restore the education system at Mirzo Ulugbek Madrasah and celebrate the 550th anniversary of the madrasah in 1970, but the initiative came up against opposition from reactionaries both in Uzbekistan and abroad. Only after Uzbekistan gained independence in 2000, academician B. Valikhodjaev tried to revive this idea in a different format. Muminov was the initiator and organizer of the conference in 1970 dedicated to the 2500th anniversary of Samarkand.Joint scientific session dedicated to the 2500th anniversary of Samarkand. TD T .: Fan, 1969 By this date, the Institute of Archeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan was formed and transferred from Tashkent to Samarkand. In connection with the festivities of the 2500th anniversary of Samarkand, the Museum of the History of the Foundation of Samarkand was opened, and for the first time in the history of the Uzbek SSR, a monument to Mirzo Ulugbek was erected. A monument was also erected to the classics of oriental poetry A. Jami and A. Navoi. Under the editorship of Muminov, a two-volume history of Samarkand was prepared and published from ancient times until 1969. The main scientific activity of Muminov was related to the study of the philosophical heritage of the peoples of Central Asia.

The Langenthal‚ÄìMelchnau railway (Bahnstrecke Langenthal‚ÄìMelchnau) is a metre-gauge line between Langenthal and St. Urban in Switzerland; it originally ran to Melchnau. It was built by the former Langental-Melchnau Railway (Langenthal-Melchnau-Bahn; LMB). The line runs through the cantons of Bern and Lucerne and is now operated by Aare Seeland mobil.  History  The construction work began on 6 December 1915, not from Langenthal, but from Langenthal Gaswerk junctions on the Langenthal‚ÄìOensingen railway of the Langenthal-Jura Railway (Langenthal-Jura-Bahn, LJB). This had opened on 26 October 1912. This short section was used by trains of both the Langental-Melchnau Railway and the Langenthal-Jura Railway. All of the Langenthal‚ÄìSt. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau railway was opened on 6 October 1917 by the former Langental-Melchnau Railway and it was operated electrically from the beginning. Since the line and the rolling stock of the Langenthal-Melchnau Railway were built to the same standards as the Langenthal-Jura Railway, the rolling stock could be freely operated over both lines. Transporter wagons were used for freight transport from the beginning. These allowed the transport of goods without time-consuming reloading on to standard gauge wagons. Management and operation of the line was originally carried out by the Langenthal-Jura Railway. As a result of a merger and a name change, the line was operated by the Oberaargau-Jura Railway (Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen; OJB), which was established in 1958 as a result of the merger of the Langenthal-Jura Railway and the Langental-Melchnau Railway. In 1990, the company was renamed Regionalverkehr Oberaargau (\\"Oberaargau Regional Transport\\"; RVO). This was in turn merged with the Biel‚ÄìT√§uffelen‚ÄìIns railway (Biel-T√§uffelen-Ins-Bahn; BTI), the Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway (Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn; SNB) and the Oberaargauische Automobilkurse (OAK) to form Aare Seeland mobil (ASm) in 1999. Since then, Aare Seeland has been the owner and operator of the line. Passenger services operate between Langenthal and St. Urban Ziegelei every half hour. = Partial conversion to bus operation = Under the former Oberaargau-Jura Railway, passenger traffic between St. Urban, in the canton of Lucerne, and Melchnau, in the canton of Bern, was transferred to bus on 22 May 1982. A new bus route now ran from Roggwil to Melchnau via St. Urban and Untersteckholz and another new bus route ran from Langenthal to Melchnau directly via Obersteckholz, avoiding the time-consuming detour via Roggwil and St. Urban. However, the bus route from Roggwil via St. Urban and Untersteckholz to Melchnau ran for only a short time. As a result, Untersteckholz its access to public transport. The short section from St. Urban to St. Urban Ziegelei was reopened for passenger traffic on 28 May 1989. = Closure of the St. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau section= The station building of Melchnau together with the coach house as well as the station building of Untersteckholz have been sold to private individuals. The only major freight customer on the St. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau section before the line was finally closed in 2012 was the Melchnau branch of the Landi agricultural cooperative. The St. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau section was dismantled from 2015 to 2016. The dismantling was financed by the sale of the land the line was built on and materials resulting from the demolition. The main buyer in Melchnau was the municipality of Melchnau, which will use the acquired land for a future flood protection project.

Studies have been made to exploit the hydroelectric potential of the river, which could be around 1,200 MW from three dams. Location The Little M√©catina River is about long, of which about is in Labrador. The river has a Strahler number of 7. It originates to the east of Lake Aticonac near the border between the Atlantic and Saint Lawrence Basins. This is along the border between Quebec and Newfoundland claimed by Quebec, well north of the border defined in 1927 by the Privy Council. It flows through the unorganized territories of Lac-J√©r√¥me and Petit- M√©catina. It winds in a generally south-east direction, then turns south and empties into the Gulf of St. Lawrence a short distance west of Little Mecatina Island. The N√©tagamiou River forms north of its mouth, where it forks off to the right from the Little M√©catina. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of C√¥te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent in Le Golfe-du-Saint- Laurent Regional County Municipality. The proposed Harrington Harbour Biodiversity Reserve would lie in the river's watershed. Name The Innu call the river Nataukamiu Hipu, or \\"river with broken waters\\". In Naskapi it is called Kuekuatsheunekap Shipu, or \\"wolverine river\\". M√©catina comes from the Innu language term makatinau, meaning \\"large mountain\\". The meaning in the Cree language is either \\"red mountain\\" or \\"large mountain\\". In 1694 Louis Jolliet used the term Mecatinachis for the island of Little M√©catina. Jean- Baptiste-Louis Franquelin used \\"Petit M√©catina\\" to identify the river in 1699. The qualifiers Petit and Gros (Small and Big) were used to distinguish two trading posts in the 18th century. On 20 September 1739 Jean-Baptiste Pommereau was granted a concession for the Gros M√©catinat, and on 15 January 1740 the intendant Gilles Hocquart granted Henri-Albert de Saint-Vincent seven or eight leagues of shoreline at Petit Mecatina. The names of the rivers that led inland from these trading posts were translated as the Big Mecatina River (Rivi√®re du Gros M√©catina) and Little Mecatina River (Rivi√®re du Petit M√©catina) by the English. Fishing In 2017 all salmon, large and small, had to be released on the Malbaie (Gasp√© Peninsula), Pigou, Bouleau, Magpie, Coacoachou, N√©tagamiou, Little M√©catina and V√©co rivers. Only young salmon could be retained on 51 rivers, and limited retention of large salmon was allowed on 19 rivers. Hydrology The drainage basin covers . About 56.2% of the basin is in Labrador north of the provincial boundary. The river floods during the spring thaw, flow is reduced in summer, rises again in fall, then drops to a minimum in winter. A station near the mouth of the river records flows of in May, in September, in October and in March. The Ministry of the Environment has operated a hydrometric station since February 1967 higher up at from the Ruisseau Chanion. It monitors flow from a drainage basin of . Over the period from 1973 to 2015, annual average flow varied from in 1987 to in 1980. Flow in 2015 averaged , varying from in April to in May. Hydroelectric potential Hydro-Qu√©bec has been considering a project to build a new 1,200 MW hydroelectric complex on the river, which has potential to host several dams. Just after work started on the Romaine River complex, in 2009 Prime Minister Jean Charest asked Hydro-Qu√©bec to start studies of developing the Little M√©catina River. The project, which would flood , would require consent by the La Romaine Band Council. Although studies began in 2002, as of 2011 the Innu had been given little information. The Quebec Prime Minister Fran√ßois Legault said during his 2018 election campaign that he wanted to start a major hydroelectric project during his time in office, and in November 2018 he met with Ontario premier Doug Ford to discuss sale of electricity to Ontario. Eric Martel, CEO of Hydro-Qu√©bec, said \\"I can easily see that in 2021-2022 we will have make a decision to perhaps build something that would be ready in 2038, 2039 or 2040.\\" The proposal is for three dams, which would be ready after the present surplus of electricity had ended.

The expulsion was ordered by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria after approval by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Nearly 70,000 Karachays of the Caucasus were deported from their native land. The crime was a part of a Soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non- Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s. Officially the deportation was a response to the Karachays supposed collaboration with occupying German forces. Originally restricted only to family members of rebel bandits during World War II, the deportation was later expanded to include the entire Karachay ethnic group. The Soviet government refused to acknowledge that 20,000 Karachays served in the Red Army, greatly outnumbering the 3,000 estimated to have collaborated with the German soldiers. The deportation contributed to between 13,000 and 19,000 deaths, resulting in a 19% mortality rate for the deported population. The Karachays were the first North Caucasus ethnic group targeted by Stalin's policy of complete resettlement, which later encompassed five other groups. They were rehabilitated in 1956 after Nikita Khrushchev became the new Soviet Premier and undertook a process of de- Stalinization. In 1957, the Karachays were released from special settlements and allowed to return to their home region, which was formalized as the Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast. By 1959, nearly 85% of Soviet Karachays resided in Karachay-Cherkessia. Later, in 1989, the Soviet government declared the deportation was a crime. Contemporary scholars and historians sometimes include the Chechens, Ingush, Kalmyks and the Karachays as the ethnic groups who were singled out by Stalin's genocidal behavior. Background The Karachays are a Turkic Muslim ethnic group who live in the Northern Caucasus. They are thought to be part of a once larger Turkic group which was conquered by the Mongol invasions in the 1200s and then by Timur in the 1300s; by 1400s, they became a differentiated ethnic group. Following the Russian conquest of the Caucasus, they came under the rule of the Russian Empire in 1828, but revolted against the Tsarist rule. During the Russian Civil War in 1917, the Karachays had a short period of independence, but this was reversed when it became a part of the Soviet Union. In the 1929‚Äì30 uprising, around 3,000 Karachays and Balkars were shot by the Soviet forces. In the 1920s, Joseph Stalin emerged as the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Ben Kiernan, an American academic and historian, described Stalin's era as \\"by far the bloodiest of Soviet or even Russian history\\". In November 1921, the Congress of the people of the Karachays and Circassia voted to establish a joint autonomy. In 1922, the Karachay Autonomous Oblast was established. The 1939 Soviet census registered 75,737 Karachays. During World War II, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, annexing much of the western parts of the Soviet Union. Between 1941 and 1943, the people of Karachay-Cherkessia allocated 52 million rubles to the Soviet defence efforts. The Karachay soldiers serving the Red Army fought in the Battle of Moscow and helped defeat the \\"Edelweiss\\" division. Nevertheless, the Wehrmacht occupied the Karachay oblast in August 1942. The Gestapo tortured and killed numerous Karachays. The anti-Soviet band groups, led by Izmail Dudov and M. Botashev, attacked the Soviet forces, including the Red Army, but also terrorized the local population. The German authorities also allowed for the formation of the Karachay National Committee. 362 paratroopers, which included some 200 Karachays, were dispatched by the German soldiers in the region in order to destabilize it. The Soviet army recaptured the region in January 1943, thereby arresting 8,673 persons by April the same year. 65 bands were eliminated, their weapons confiscated. The Karachay National Committee fled with the German army. On 15 April 1943, the Soviet Office of the Prosecutor General issued Directive N 52-6927, ordering the deportation of the family members of the active band groups outside the Karachay region. 177 families, numbering 673 people, were subject to deportation. Deportation During World War II, eight ethnic groups were expelled in their entirety from their native lands by the Soviet government: the Volga Germans, the Chechens, the Ingush, the Balkars, the Karachays, the Crimean Tatars, the Meskhetian Turks and the Kalmyks. Approximately 650,000 people were deported from the Caucasus region in 1943 and 1944 and a total of 3,332,589 people were deported during the entire war. The Karachays were the first people to be completely deported from the Northern Caucasus. By October 1943, Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria, Head of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, decided upon the complete deportation of the Karachays, codenamed Operation Seagull. Ivan Serov, the Deputy Commissar of the NKVD, and Amayak Kobulov, were assigned to carry out the plan. All the Karachay were supposed to be deported, even members of the Communist Party and the Komsomol. They were formally charged with Axis collaboration during World War II. The Soviet government refused to acknowledge that 20,000 Karachays served in the Red Army, greatly outnumbering the 3,000 estimated to have collaborated with the German soldiers. 35 Karachays were given the Hero of the Soviet Union award. On 14 October 1943, the Soviet government issued resolution no. 1118-342 ss, officially commencing the deportation. 20,000 NKVD officers and 7,000 operational workers were sent to the region to implement the operation. No major instances of resistance was reported. The Karachays were allowed to carry of property with them on the trip, but no more than per family. Prior to the deportation, the NKVD searched the homes of the locals and confiscated firearms, rifles, revolvers and other weapons. The Karachays were then loaded onto cattle cars. These railroad cars were dispatched to Central Asia, mostly to the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic. Starting from 2 November 1943, a total of 69,267 Karachays were deported in the operation. Since most of young men were serving in the Red Army, the deported people consisted mostly out of children under the age of 16 (50%) and women (30%). During the transit, the trains would seldomly stop and open the doors to distribute food, and during that occasion the deportees were not allowed to walk further than away from the wagons. Many older people and children died during the long transit, caused by a lack of medical assistance and food shortages. A local NKVD report, dated April 1945, registered 40,046 Karachays in the Kazakh SSR, 22,112 in the Kyrgyz SSR and 353 in the Uzbek SSR. This is a total of 62,529 Karachays in 1945, down from 69,267 who were deported two years prior. Only 53 of the deportees were officially registered as bandits. In 1944, demobilized officers of the Red Army were also sent to the Kazakh SSR. In May 1944, 90 additional Karachays found in the Rostov Region, Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, Dagestan and other places in the region were also deported. The Karachay Autonomous Oblast was abolished and carved up between the Krasnodar and Stavropol Krai, as well as Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. After this operation, the Soviet media was forbidden mentioning the accomplishments of the deported peoples on the Eastern front. Possible reasons Scholar Svante Cornell points out that the Caucasus deportations were a part of a larger Russian policy that had been in effect since 1864: to remove as many Muslim minorities from the Caucasus as possible. Scholars Alexandre Bennigsen and Marie Broxup somewhat agree, assuming that the resettlement was aimed at solving the \\"Muslim problem\\" of the rebellious people of the North Caucasus. The Soviet authorities tried to forge a state out of 108 different nationalities. Initially they tried to use this multiethnic state to exploit cross-border ethnic groups to project influence into the countries neighboring the Soviet Union. Terry Martin, a professor of Russian studies, assessed that this had the opposite effect; the Soviet fear of \\"capitalist influence\\" eventually led to ethnic cleansing of its borderlands. Martin gives four possible reasons for the deportations from the Caucasus: security, social disorder, Russification and revenge. He dismisses the security reason since the five North Caucasus ethnic groups were far from the Turkish border, but accepts that social disorder, caused by long anti- Soviet resistance of these groups, Russification and punishment for Axis collaboration of some were contributing factors for Soviet decision to start the deportations. American anthropologist Jeffrey Cole assumes that the Karachays were just one of several \\"weak minorities used as scapegoats\\" in order for the Stalinist system to conceal its own mistakes and failures in World War II. Exile and casualties The Karachays, among with other peoples deported from the Caucasus, were placed under the administration of the special settlements and sent to labor camps. They were dispersed between 550 settlements in Central Asia. These settlements provided forced labor for underdeveloped and inhospitable regions of the Soviet Union. The Karachays were assigned to work in the agriculture, livestock and construction sector. The special settlers routinely worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week. They suffered from exhaustion, cold, and hunger, with food rations tied to work quotas. They were not paid for their work. Due to the World War II evacuations, the Central Asian areas were already overloaded with refugees from European Russia, lacking housing. The accommodation of the deportees thus proved difficult: in one district, out of 1,445 deported families, only 175 were provided with housing by the end of 1944. Others had to live in houses of farmers, sheds, barns, brigade bases or in tents. The cold weather of Central Asia and lack of sanitation led to diseases, including dysentery and malaria. Their food rations were sometimes not delivered by the kolkhozes. Although initially reluctant to make contact with them, the Kyrgyz locals eventually showed hospitality and sympathy with the Karachays. Some were reported to have shared their food with the deportees. In August 1944, the Soviet government provided aid to the Karachay deportees, in the form of 600 tonnes of grain, 150 tonnes of cereals, and 4,859,900 rubles. The mortality caused by the resettlement and living conditions in exile is estimated at somewhere between 13,100 and 19,000 fatalities. This represent a mortality rate of 19%. 653 people died during the transit, including from thirst and heat prostration caused by being locked up in the trains. The recorded population of the Karachays in special settlements reached a recorded low of 56,869 on 26 November 1948. Estimate of the mortality rate of the Karachays: { width=100%  bgcolor=Red width=19%19%  bgcolor=Blue width=81%Died in exile  Survived in exile } The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree on 26 November 1948, titled \\"On Criminal Accountability for Escapes from Places of Compulsory and Permanent Settlement by Persons Exiled to Remote Regions of the Soviet Union during the Period of the Great Patriotic War\\". The decree formally stated that all deported ethnic groups must remain in permanent exile. Aftermath and legacy Memorial to the deported Karachays, Uchkeken After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev started a process of de- Stalinization, reversing many of previous policies. In his secret speech on 24 February 1956, Khrushchev condemned the ethnic deportations: In August 1953, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union overturned the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1948, which ordered that all the evicted ethnic groups must remain in permanent exile. On 16 July 1956, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet officially released the Karachays, Chechens and the Ingush from special settlements. In 1957, the Karachays were allowed to return to their native land: by 1959, nearly 85% of Soviet Karachays resided in Karachay-Cherkessia. Their return was sometimes problematic: they found Russians living in their homes, forcing them to find other places to stay in the region. On 14 November 1989 the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union declared all of Stalin's deportations \\"illegal and criminal\\". On 26April 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, under its chairman Boris Yeltsin, followed suit and passed the law On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples with Article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as \\"Stalin's policy of defamation and genocide\\". Russian historian Pavel Polian considered all the deportations of entire ethnic groups during Stalin's era, including those from the Caucasus, a crime against humanity. By 1995, 23,024 Karachays were issued with certificates confirming their rehabilitation. Professor Brian Glyn Williams concluded that the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks, in spite of their lands never coming close to the scene of combat during World War II and which coincided with the deportation of other ethnic groups from Caucasus and Crimea, lends the strongest evidence that all the deportations were a part of a larger concealed Soviet foreign policy rather than a response to any \\"universal mass treason\\". In its 1991 report, Human Rights Watch described all of the Soviet mass deportations as a form of collective punishment since groups were targeted on the basis of their ethnicity. It also noted that none of these ethnic groups were given any kind of compensation for the harm caused by the deportations. Contemporary scholars and historians sometimes include the Karachays as one of the deported ethnic groups who were victims of an attempted Soviet genocide.Pohl 1997, p. 81 Others disagree. Professor Alexander Statiev argues that Stalin's administration did not have a specific intent (dolus specialis) to exterminate the various deported peoples, but that Soviet \\"political culture, poor planning, haste, and wartime shortages were responsible for the genocidal death rate among them.\\" He rather considers these deportations an example of Soviet assimilation and re-education of \\"stigmatized people\\".

The instrumentation was first recorded by slide guitarist Earl Hooker with backing musicians. Chicago blues artist Muddy Waters later overdubbed vocals and Chess Records released it as a single in 1963. The song has since been covered by other artists, including the Small Faces, retitled \\"You Need Loving\\". Led Zeppelin subsequently adapted the song for their 1969 hit \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", which prompted Dixon to file a lawsuit against them in 1985, after his daughter heard it.  Muddy Waters song  = Background = Similar to his previous single, \\"You Shook Me\\", Muddy Waters dubbed his vocals onto a backing track, a formula also followed for \\"Little Brown Bird\\" and \\"Black Angel\\". In July 1962, Chess Records owner Leonard Chess contacted blues slide guitarist Earl Hooker to record additional tunes for a new record by Waters. However, Waters was on tour in Ohio, and during his absence, Hooker and the group cut three instrumental backing tracks. Besides Hooker and organist Big Moose Walker, there are different accounts of who provided the instrumental backing. On October 12, 1962, Waters overdubbed his vocals. Of the three recordings cut that day, \\"Black Angel\\" remains unissued. The vocals are apparently derived from several earlier songs by Waters, such as \\"Rollin' Stone\\", \\"Still A Fool\\" and \\"She's Alright\\". The song is based on a guitar riff in the key of E minor. Marie Dixon, Willie Dixon's wife insists that the songs is specially about her: = Release = Chess first released the song on a 7-inch single, backed with \\"Little Brown Bird\\" in 1963. As with many of Waters' later singles, it failed to chart on both Billboard 100 and the magazine's rhythm and blues chart. In the United Kingdom, the single was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by a four-track EP with \\"Little Brown Bird\\", \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"Muddy Waters Twist\\". The EP was a favorite of Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck during their teenage years. = Personnel = * Muddy Waters ‚Äì lead vocals * Earl Hooker ‚Äì guitar * John 'Big Moose' Walker ‚Äì organ Additional musicians may include: * A.C.

The tune, which was a largely improvisational jam by the group, had been a part of their live repertoire along with other rhythm and blues songs since they formed, and was therefore popular with the mod subculture of the 1960s. At the time, their setlist consisted of about five songs, two originals by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, \\"E Too D and \\"Come On Children\\". The remaining songs were \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\\",\\"Baby Don't You Do It\\" and \\"You Need Love\\". It is also noteworthy for 19-year old Marriott's raw vocals, one of his most well known characteristics. The opening verse of the Muddy Waters' original was not included anywhere in \\"You Need Loving\\", with the Small Faces adding their own bits instead, such as \\"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\\" and \\"I can't monkey and I can't dog. Can't do the monkey, yeah\\" Infact, the majority of the track was re-written in order to better fit Marriott's style of singing. The first verse was completely remade by replacing it with an altered version of the last verse found in \\"You Need Love\\": Despite containing several verses found in the original, on original 1966 pressings of the group's debut album, it is only credited to Marriott and Ronnie Lane. Allegedly, this was a business tactic used by Small Faces manager Don Arden in order to get more royalties. In fact, Arden kept the royalties himself, with the band earning only ¬£20 a week, despite multiple top ten entries on the UK Singles Chart. Dixon did not sue Arden or the band, because he did not know of its existence. On most later reissues of the album, Dixon is credited as a songwriter. The group recorded the song live for Saturday Club and can be found on the compilation album The BBC Sessions. = Personnel = * Steve Marriott ‚Äì lead vocals, lead guitar * Ronnie Lane ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals * Ian McLagan ‚Äì Hammond organ, backing vocals * Kenney Jones ‚Äì drums  Similarities with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"  Newly formed British heavy metal band Led Zeppelin recorded a song titled \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", and released it, backed with \\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\\" as a single in November 1969. The track was their first big hit single, reaching number four on Billboard Hot 100 and number two in Cashbox magazine. The song was largely conceived by Jimmy Page, but is credited to the entire band. Lyrically however, the song refers to \\"You Need Love\\" Vocally, lead singer Robert Plant phrases the song in the style of Marriott, similar to \\"You Need Loving\\". Marriott later stated \\"He sang it the same, phrased it the same, even the stops at the end were the same\\". Marriott would later admit that both Page and Plant frequented and attended concerts by Small Faces: \\"That‚Äôs where Jimmy Page and Robert Plant heard it. Robert Plant used to follow us around. He was like a fan.\\" Plant would eventually later apologize to Marriott in a backstage encounter during the 1970s. However, Marriott would not belittle \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", as the first time he heard it he reportedly shouted \\"Go on, my son!\\" In 1985, Dixon would file a lawsuit against the group after her daughter brought it to his attention. The case would eventually be settled out of court and on all reissues of Led Zeppelin II, Dixon is credited as a co-writer on the track. Page has on multiple occasion objected the claims that the composition was plagiarized, and insists that only the lyrics were. Robert Plant would later complain in an interview.

Notable works Evans created some site-specific sculptures in South Wales in the early 1970s. These included a 40-foot-long unnamed sculpture in coal-black steel, which was installed on The Hayes, Cardiff, in early May 1972. It was inspired by Evans' family stories about the South Wales coalmining (and steel) industry. The sculpture was commissioned by the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation for their City Sculpture Project and intended to remain on site for six months.

He showed very promising form as a juvenile in 2017 when he won two of his three races including the Autumn Stakes. Training problems restricted him to only one start in 2018, a victory in the Prix du Prince d'Orange. In the spring of 2019 he won the Prix d'Harcourt and ran third in the Prix Ganay before returning in autumn to win the Grosser Preis von Baden by fourteen lengths. In 2020 he added victories in the Dubai Millennium Stakes, Coronation Cup, Eclipse Stakes and International Stakes. Background Ghaiyyath is a bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Springbank Way Stud. As a foal in November 2015 he was offered for sale at Goffs and was bought for ‚Ç¨1,100,000 by John Ferguson on behalf of Godolphin. The colt was sent into training with Charlie Appleby at Godolphin's British base at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Dubawi, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Ghaiyyath's dam Nightime was a top-class performer who won the Irish 1,000 Guineas in 2008 and went on to produce several other winners including the Man o' War Stakes winner Zhukova. Nightime's dam Caumshinaun, who produced seven other winners, was a successful racemare who won five races including the Listed Platinum Stakes in 2001. She was a distant descendant of the British broodmare Springtime (foaled 1932), the ancestor of numerous major winners including Blakeney, Morston and Classic Cliche. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Ghaiyyath made his racecourse debut on 15 September in a maiden race over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse in which he started the 6/5 favourite but finished third behind Blue Laureate and Sha La La La Lee. Thirteen days later the colt was equipped with a hood when he went off favourite for a similar event at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden as on his debut by James Doyle he led from the start and went clear in the last quarter mile to win \\"easily\\" by five lengths. William Buick took the ride when the colt was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Autumn Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 14 October and started the 11/4 second favourite behind the John Gosden-trained Bear Slam. After racing in mid-division he struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile but broke through to take the lead in the closing stages and won by one and three quarter lengths from Dream Today with two and a half lengths back to Bear Slam in third. Buick commented \\"He bunny-hopped out of the stalls and I wanted to be closer than what I was but they went a nice gallop and he travelled sweet throughout and won well in the end.He gave me a nice feel. He's a big horse who is going to be better next year.\\" =2018: three-year-old season= In early 2018 Ghaiyyath was considered a serious contender for the Epsom Derby, but after sustaining a training injury when being prepared for a run in the Dante Stakes he was off the track until the autumn of 2018. On 22 September he made his return in the Prix du Prince d'Orange over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started the 1.9/1 favourite in a seven-runner field. With Buick in the saddle he raced in second place behind his pacemaking stablemate Stage Magic before going to the front 300 metres from the finish and pulling clear to win by three lengths from Sacred Life. =2019: four- year-old season= Ghaiyyath spent the winter of 2018/19 at Godolphin's base in Dubai. On 7 April, he began his third campaign in the Group 3 Prix d'Harcourt over 2000 metres at Longchamp and started the 7/10 favourite against four opponents headed by the Prix Jean Prat winner Intellogent. He took the lead from the start and opened up a big advantage over his rivals before being eased down in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Soleil Marin. Appleby commented \\"I am delighted with that performance ‚Äì he is a horse with a future... Ghaiyyath is a very strong galloper. If something could go faster than him, then we would let them go on, but nothing can give him a lead because he is such a strong traveller\\". Three weeks later at the same track the colt was moved up to Group 1 level for the first time and started the 1/2 favourite for the Prix Ganay over 2100 metres and sustained his first defeat in over eighteen months as he came home third behind Waldgeist and Study of Man. After four months off the track Ghaiyyath made his comeback in Germany on 1 September when he started 2.3/1 second favourite for the Group 1 Grosser Preis von Baden over 2400 metres. The three- year-old colt Laccario headed the betting after winning the Deutsches Derby while the other seven runners included Communique (Princess of Wales's Stakes), Ashrun (Prix de Reux), Accon (Fr√ºhjahrs Dreij√§hrigen-Preis) and Donjah (Herzog von Ratibor-Rennen). Ghaiyyath led from the start and extended his lead in the straight to finish fourteen lengths clear of Donjah in second, despite being eased down by Buick in the final strides. After the race Buick said \\"He's a monster, an absolute monster. Let's hope that he'll be around for a while. He's an amazing horse\\". On 6 October Ghaiyyath started 13/1 fourth favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp. He led the race until 500 metres from the finish but then tired and dropped back rapidly to come home tenth of the twelve runners, more than thirty lengths behind the winner Waldgeist. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Ghaiyyath was given a rating of 126, making him the 5th best racehorse in the world. =2020: five-year-old season= Spring As in the previous season Ghaiyyath spent the winter of 2019/20 in Dubai and began his campaign on 20 February when he started 4/9 favourite for the Group 3 Dubai Millennium Stakes (a race named after his grandsire) over 2000 metres at Meydan Racecourse, with the best of his six opponents looking to be Spotify (winner of the race in 2019) and Desert Encounter (Canadian International Stakes). Ghaiyyath led from the start and won \\"easily\\" by eight and a half lengths in a track record time of 2:00.33. Appleby commented I'm delighted. We've all seen what this horse can do, especially coming up his first start, there... The plan was to just let him float into the race from his outside post and once he was on the lead, we would let him roll along. We've seen on numerous occasions what he can do when he's left to his own devices like that.\\" Ghaiyyath was scheduled to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic on Dubai World Cup Night in March but the meeting was abandoned owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Summer The flat racing season in Europe was rearranged in response to the COVID outbreak and the Group 1 Coronation Cup was run over one and a half miles at Newmarket (rather than Epsom) on 5 June. With Buick in the saddle Ghaiyyath started the 11/10 favourite in a seven runner field which also included Stradivarius, Anthony Van Dyck, Defoe and Desert Encounter. Ghaiyyath went to the front from the start, opened up a clear advantage by half way and was never seriously challenged, coming home two and a half lengths clear of Anthony Van Dyck. The winning time of 2:25.89 was a new course record. Appleby commented \\"He was on it from flagfall but I could see he was in a rhythm we'd seen before. His mid-race move just kills them and it's great for him to get his first British Group 1 win. We had a lot of confidence that we had him in a condition that we haven't seen before. His strength is there and the way he was finishing off his gallops suggested he was the finished article.\\" On 5 July at Sandown Park Ghaiyyath was dropped back in distance and started 9/4 second favourite behind Enable for the ten furlong Eclipse Stakes. The other five contenders were Japan, Deirdre, Magic Wand (Mackinnon Stakes), Regal Reality (Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and Bangkok. Ghaiyyath led from the start as usual, accelerated three furlongs out and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a quarter lengths and a head from Enable and Japan. After the race William Buick said \\"He's got a huge cruising speed and he knows how to use it. He's a joy to ride and a very, very good horse. As a five-year- old he's mature physically and mentally... I think a mile and a quarter will be his optimum trip... Sometimes when you ride him over a mile and a half you're always worried the last furlong is going to be a long one, but he keeps going.\\" Shortly after the race Ghaiyyath was rated the best horse in the world in the interim edition of the World Rankings. Ghaiyyath returned for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 15 August and went off the 11/8 favourite against four opponents namely Magical, Lord North, Kameko and Rose of Kildare (Musidora Stakes). He established a clear lead soon after the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by three lengths from Magical despite being eased down in the closing stages. Buick commented \\"He has this amazing high cruising speed, but I thought what was evident today was the kick he had a furlong and a half out. He completely put the race to bed, finished it off, and stamped his authority. He can do things that other horses don't do. He gives you confidence. His comfort zone is different to other horses... He's the best I've ridden, without a doubt\\". Ghaiyyath was aiming for the 2020 Breeders' Cup, but in preparation for the race, after a piece of routine work on the weekend, he showed signs of soreness behind. After veterinary investigation, Ghaiyyath was found to be muscle sore. The exertions of a long season, which started in Dubai in January, were starting to show, and the decision was made to retire him. Retirement Ghaiyyath had three of the four best performances of any racehorse in the world in 2020, and was bred on the same hugely successful Dubawi/Galileo cross that has also produced Classic winner and sire of the moment Night of Thunder. He will stand at Kildangan Stud in 2021.

Griffiths Mansion is a historic house at 3806 S. Michigan Avenue in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois. The house was built in 1893-94 for John W. Griffiths, a prominent building contractor who worked in Chicago during its reconstruction after the Great Chicago Fire. Architect Solon Beman designed the Chateauesque house, which features a limestone-clad exterior, an octagon-shaped tower on its northeast corner, corbels along the roof line, and dormers topped with finials. The house was typical of those on Michigan Avenue at the time, as many affluent Chicagoans built their homes there; it was also one of the last such homes, as the Panic of 1893 and industrial development led the area to lose its popularity with the wealthy. After Griffiths died in the 1930s, the home became the meeting place of the Quincy Club, a social club for black railroad workers. It later became the first home of the DuSable Museum of African American History. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1982.

Plan (full map) The M&StJWR; had received authorisation in July 1864 to construct a railway from the Metropolitan Railway's (MR's) station at Baker Street to a station near the London and North Western Railway's station at Finchley Road. The line was to be partly funded and operated by the MR. Before construction had begun, an extension was authorised across mostly open countryside to the village of Hampstead. The station was to be located at the junction of Willow Road, Flask Walk and Weatherall Place (now the south end of Well Walk). The extension was authorised in May 1865. The route between Swiss Cottage and Hampstead included an incline of 1 in 27 (3.7%) for which five special engines were constructed by the MR to deal with the steep grade. The M&StJWR; struggled financially and the plans for the line to Finchley Road were reduced in scope so that it opened in 1868 as a single-track line only as far as Swiss Cottage and the continuation to Finchley Road and Hampstead was postponed. The plan was formally abandoned in 1870. A section of tunnel built north of Swiss Cottage station in readiness for the line north was used for the MR's later extension to the north-west. A short length northwards was unused. This is still visible today when travelling on a southbound Metropolitan line service. Separate proposals by other promoters for a line from Swiss Cottage to Alexandra Palace via Hampstead were promoted in 1875 and 1877, but were withdrawn for financial reasons and lack of support from the MR.

It targeted Saudi Arabia and allied forces along the Saudi Arabia‚ÄìYemen border. At the operation's height in late September, the Houthi-led forces reportedly encircled and destroyed a substantial concentration of Saudi-led forces. The Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree in a press conference, said that three Saudi-led brigades alongside KSA forces were besieged and defeated following a 72 hour battle south of Najran. Thousands of enemy forces were reported casualties with over 500 Saudi led forces killed and 2,500 captured. and 15 vehicles burned out. According to the Houthi spokesman, the Saudi brigades were preparing for a major attack against the Houthis in retaliation to the attack on Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities, however the Houthis were able to lure the Saudi troops into their trap. According to the Houthi military spokesman, Saudi warplanes then conducted airstrikes targeting the Saudi captives but the spokesman assured the families of the captives that they were able to hide and protect them from the coalition airstrikes. The Houthis have described the attack as \\"the largest operation since aggression started on our country (Yemen)\\". Background Following the Houthi takeover in Yemen, a border conflict erupted along the Yemeni-Saudi border. Saudi-backed forces attempted to advance into the Houthis' core territories of northern Yemen, while pro-Houthi forces launched incursions into Saudi Arabia. Besides the general enmity between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, the border conflict also takes place amid the still contentious issue where the border should be located in the first place. The southwestern Saudi Arabian province of Najran was traditionally part of Yemen until it was conquered by the former in 1934. Since then, many Yemenis continue to regard Najran as Yemeni territory. In late 2019, Saudi-led forces under Brig. Gen. Musa Bin Dhaher Al-Balawi launched a major offensive into Saada Governorate, pushing backed the area's Houthi-led defenders. The pro- Saudi units included several Yemeni tribal militias, most importantly the al- Fatah Brigade. Facing relatively light resistance, the al-Fatah Brigade and some Saudi Arabian Army troops dispersed in northern Saada Governorate's canyons and mountains, most importantly Jabara Valley, leaving them vulnerable to counterattacks. Furthermore, the Saudi-led forces' supply situation remained problematic, as the Houthis held onto the strategically important location of Tanab. Operation The Battle of the Jabara Valley, the first phase of Operation Victory from God. Operation Victory from God began on 25 August 2019, as Houthi fighters and allied militias (Popular Committees) allegedly began to attack Saudi-led troops at about 300 points in the area between Najran and Jabara Valley. In late August, about 4,000 Houthi-led troops encircled and besieged a significant part of the al-Fatah Brigade in Jabara Valley. The Royal Saudi Air Force provided inadequate support, and the morale of the encircled troops plummeted due to a lack of food and water. A few hundred managed to break through the Houthi siege, but the rest eventually surrendered. One al-Fatah Brigade militiaman later accused the unit's commander, Major General Radad al-Hashemi, of gross incompetence during the battle. By 1 September, the remaining troops of the al-Fateh Brigade still clashed with advancing Houthi forces at Kitaf in Saada Governorate. On 28 September 2019, the Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said that during an operation launched 72 hours prior near the border with the southwestern Saudi region of Najran, three \\"enemy military brigades had fallen\\" which was supported by the group's drone, missile and air defence units. The latter allegedly launched extensive missile and drone strikes against military targets in Saudi Arabia. According to the Houthis, \\"thousands\\" of Saudi troops, including many officers and soldiers of the Saudi army, as well as \\"hundreds of armoured vehicles\\" were captured. The spokesman said that the Yemeni fighters are capable of further penetrating into Saudi territories \\"in case it continues its aggression against Yemen\\". He assured the family of captives, \\"they will be kept in a secret place in order to keep them safe from any harm.\\" The bodies of the killed troops, however, were simply dumped in the local mountains. The Long War Journal, a United States-based news website, analysed the footage released by the Houthis. It concluded that the number of Saudi losses was probably grossly exaggerated, and that most of the shown prisoners of war did not belong to regular Saudi troops but to pro-Saudi Yemeni militias. However, some of the captured vehicles and surrendered soldiers belonged to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Furthermore, the Long War Journal argued that the footage was probably compiled from several smaller clashes which had occurred from August to September, instead of indicating one massive battle. Regardless, the news website also regarded the footage as genuine, stating that \\"it is evident from the video and subsequent photos that hundreds of Saudi troops and allied tribal fighters have indeed been killed or captured in recent weeks.\\" Pro-Saudi analyst Yaseen al-Tamimi argued that Operation Victory from God had probably taken place in late August at the Wadi Jabarah area of Kataf district, and concurred with the Long War Journal that most of the prisoners were troops loyal to the pro-Saudi Yemeni government. In contrast, the Saudi-led coalition spokesman denied all Houthi claims on 30 September, claiming that the alleged operation was \\"theatrical\\" and merely served as an attempt to mislead the media. The attack came after three weeks from the Abqaiq‚ÄìKhurais attack. After the Abqaiq and Khurais attack, the Houthi movement offered a peace initiative and a unilateral halt of all drones and missile attacks inside Saudi Arabia and said that they are waiting for Saudi Arabia to do the same. In the following days, reports from media stated that Saudi Arabia agreed on limited cases-fire. However, the Houthi leader rejected the limited cases-fire calling it insufficient move and that the movement would not agree except on \\"a comprehensive stop to the aggression and the lifting of the blockade\\". Aftermath On 29 September, the head of the Houthi committee for prisoner-of-war affairs, Abdul Qader al-Murtada said that they were going to free 350 war prisoners. The following day, the Houthis unilaterally released 290 war prisoners including those who survived the Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a prison in Dhamar, Yemen which killed more than 100 war prisoners. As the BBC reported, Yahya Saree, a spokesman of the Houthi-controlled forces, said Saudi captured would be paraded on the group's TV network on Sunday. Following the offensive, the country's foreign minister used his address to the United Nations General Assembly to focus blame on Iran. He said that \\"The solution rather lies in prompting these militias to implement the agreement and honoring the obligations they have assumed before the whole world\\". Pro-Houthi media consequently reported that leading Saudi commanders in the Saudi-Yemeni border region stepped down or were dismissed due to the success of Operation Victory from God. According to Al-Alam TV, al Fatah Brigade commander Major General Radad al-Hashemi resigned from his position after the attack. However, al-Hashemi denounced these claims, arguing that his militia had not been defeated. The Northern Border Fronts and Yemeni Press Agency also reported that Brigadier General Musa Bin Dhaher Al-Balawi had been dismissed.

Her area of research is diverse, spanning across multiple topics including, applications of Hyperspectral Imaging and chemometrics to biological systems. Gowen's expertise lies in Hyperspectral Imaging, a method which, images objects and extracts information from each pixel, about wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. The results can give insights into the ‚Äòunseen‚Äô properties and chemistry of the object.  Early life and education  Ms Gowen was born and raised in Co. Kilkenny. Upon completion of secondary school, Ms Gowen began to study Theoretical Physics in Trinity College Dublin, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 2000.Gowen went on to pursue a master's in financial maths in Dublin City University (DCU) graduating in 2001.In 2002, Ms Gowen began in a new area of research, the field of Food Science, attaining her doctoral degree in food science from the Dublin institute of technology (DIT) in 2006. Her PhD thesis, completed in 2006, was centred on mathematical modelling of food quality parameters and optimization of food process operations. Gowen then spent some time as a post-doctoral researcher, investigating the intersection of near infrared spectroscopy, chemical imaging and chemometrics for characterization of biological systems.  Career research  Ms Gowen joined UCD in 2007 as a postdoctoral researcher, working on Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI).Her research involves the application and growth of multivariate analysis and image processing techniques for non-destructive assessment of biological products using HSI. In 2010 Ms Gowen spent two years in Kobe University, Japan, studying and researchingHyperspectral imaging. This research gave rise to her current endeavour, which is probing what happens to water at interfaces where it interacts with various materials. By procuring equipment and engaging in the transfer of knowledge through international collaborations with leading worldwide researchers in HSI, Ms Gowen was able to set up the first facility for Hyperspectral Imaging for food quality analysis in Ireland and currently leads the UCD spectral imaging research group.

The criminal's signature weapon was a knife.  Murders  The murders began on the morning of October 23, 1978. As victims, the killer chose the homeless, whose corpses were dumped in the alleyways of the various streets, located close to each other. The first victim was 50-year-old Jesse Martinez. On October 29th, the Stabber killed his second victim, 32-year-old Jose Cortes, followed a day later by 46-year-old Bruce Emmett Drake. On November 4th, 65-year-old J. P. Henderson was killed, and on November 9th, 39-year-old David Martin Jones was attacked and brutally killed near the Los Angeles City Hall in the downtown. Only two days later, 57-year-old Francisco P√©rez Rodriguez became the next victim. The day after, the Stabber committed a double murder, killing both 36-year-old Frank Floyd Reed and 49-year-old Augustine E. Luna. On November 17th, 34-year-old Milford Fletcher, a Native American, was also killed. Three days later, the serial killer committed his next murder against 45-year-old Frank Garc√≠a, whose body was found on November 23rd, near the City Hall. Despite the fact that this murder occurred in a prestigious area of the city, with a large crowd present, the killer managed to escape unnoticed. No witnesses were located, but an imprint of a man's hand was found next to Garc√≠a's body, which, according to the investigators, could've been left by the killer. The last confirmed victim of the Skid Row Stabber was 26-year-old Luis Alvarez, who was stabbed to death on January 21, 1979.  Investigation  During the subsequent investigation, witnesses were found to David Jones' murder: three friends of the deceased claimed that an unknown person had talked with them for several minutes before committing the murder, after which he went up to Jones and stabbed him. According to the witnesses, the criminal was a 30-year-old black man, who spoke with a Puerto Rican accent and introduced himself as \\"Luther\\". Three months later, in January 1979, the inscription \\"My name is Luther, and I kill them to save me from misery\\", was found in the toilet of the Los Angeles Bus Terminal building.  Suspect  During the investigation, several people were suspected by authorities. In early 1979, a forensic examination of the fingerprints from the palm print found next to Garc√≠a's body were revealed to belong to 29-year-old Bobby Joe Maxwell, who had been released from prison in his native Tennessee and moved to Los Angeles in 1977. A casual worker, Maxwell spent a lot of his free time in the Skid Row area, along with the homeless residents. In December 1978, he demonstrated deviant behavior against sleeping homeless people, and was arrested on charges of disturbing the public order. A knife was seized during his arrest. He was convicted and spent several weeks in the county jail, before being coincidentally released only three days before when, according to the investigators, the Stabber committed his last murder. Perhaps another peculiarity was that while Maxwell was in prison, the Skid Row Stabber didn't commit any murders, and based on these facts, he was arrested on suspicion of murder in April 1979. After his arrest, Maxwell's apartment was ransacked, during which his shoes, clothes, diaries and letters were seized. After studying and analyzing the acquired content, the investigators stated that Maxwell was a satanist. The trial, for various reasons, was delayed for 5 years, opening in early 1984. The prosecution's key witness was 37-year-old Sidney Storch, a felon with an extensive criminal record, who in 1983 was Maxwell's cellmate for three weeks. At trial, Storch claimed that Maxwell had repeatedly admitted to killing the homeless and described the murders in detail. In addition to Storch's testimony and the witnesses to David Jones' murder, the investigation established that the knife found on Maxwell had the same width and length as the one used by the killer. A graphological examination was also conducted, which concluded that Maxwell had left the note in the Bus Terminal building, confessing to the murders. On the basis of these unreliable testimonies, with unconvincing or circumstantial evidence, Bobby Joe Maxwell was found guilty of two murders at the end of 1984, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without a chance of parole. Despite the fact that there was no material evidence found in the other murders, the public and media blamed all of the 11 murders on him, resulting in Maxwell being identified as the Skid Row Stabber for many years.  Further developments  The debate over Bobby Joe Maxwell's guilt went on for several decades, with he himself pleading not guilty and regularly lodging an appeal over the next 30 years. In 2010, Maxwell's lawyers were able to prove that the witnesses to Jones' murder couldn't identify him as the killer and had given false testimonies in court, under pressure from the investigators. It was also proven that Sidney Storch, a former police officer and an informant for many years, had begun abusing his position in 1980 and had given false testimony in a number of trials due to selfish interest. As a result, in at least 6 cases, his testimony was considered invalid or unreliable. Considering these facts, the Appellate Court overturned Maxwell's sentence in 2010, and appointed him a new trial. At the end of 2017, Bobby Joe Maxwell suffered from a severe heart attack, which caused him to fall into a coma. In a new trial, the Los Angeles County Prosecutor's Office dropped all charges against Maxwell, after which, in August 2018, he was found not guilty, which his conviction and prison sentence being ruled as a miscarriage of justice. Maxwell himself died in April 2019, never regaining consciousness and unable to learn of his release. The identity of the real Skid Row Stabber remains unknown.

He is noted as the author or translator of a number of popular Christian hymns including \\"Angel Voices, Ever Singing\\" and \\"The Strife is O'er, the Battle Done\\". His hymns are an established part of the Anglican church music repertoire and commonly feature in hymnals such as The New English Hymnal. Early life Pott served a curacy at Bishopsworth, 1856-8 Pott lived in Speldhurst, Kent 1891-1909 Francis Pott was born in Southwark, London, the great-grandson of the surgeon Percivall Pott. His father was the proprietor of the family business, the Potts Vinegar factory (the site occupied today by the Sumner Buildings housing estate), and Francis grew up in a neighbouring house. The family firm was later taken over by Francis's brother, Robert Pott. Education Pott studied classical languages at Brasenose College, Oxford when Edward Bouverie Pusey was an influential figure in the Oxford Movement, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1854 and obtaining his Master's degree in 1857.A Dictionary of Hymnology - In 1856 he was ordained into the Anglican priesthood, initially serving as a curate in Bishopsworth, Gloucestershire (1856-8), before going on to serve in Ardingly, Berkshire from 1858 to 1861 and subsequently in Ticehurst, Sussex from 1861-1866. In 1866 he was appointed Rector of Norhill in Ely, Cambridgeshire. Pott suffered increasingly from hearing problems, and in 1891 was forced to resign from active work as a priest due to deafness. He went to live at the Birchetts, Speldhurst in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where he continued in his hymn-writing work. Francis Pott died at Speldhurst on 26 October 1909. Works Pott's \\"The strife is o'er, the battle done\\"() in page=839 As a scholar of classical languages, Pott was able to translate Latin and Syriac liturgical texts into English verse. One of his best-known hymns, \\"The Strife is O'er, the Battle Done\\", is a translation of a 17th-century Latin hymn, \\"Finita jam sun proelia\\". \\"The Strife is O'er\\" is often sung to the tune , adapted from a 1591 setting of the Gloria by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina from a Magnificat tertii toni. The additional Alleluia refrain was set to music by Monk. An alternative popular tune for this hymn is , named after its composer Melchior Vulpius, who originally wrote it for the hymn \\"Gelobt sei Gott im h√∂chsten Thron\\" in his 1609 Gesangbuch. \\"The Strife is O'er\\" first appeared with this setting, arranged by Henry George Ley, in the 1925 hymnal Songs of Praise. Pott took an interest in the hymn tunes used to set his words to music; in particular, he expressed a dislike for the tune written by Arthur Sullivan for \\"Angel Voices, Ever Singing\\", which Pott considered a \\"trivial, pretty but altogether unfit tune\\".

He was one of five children of a plumber father and a mother who helped her children make bouquets out of artificial flowers at home. He dropped out of college to serve in the United States Marines during World War II. In 1946, he returned to the United States, and soon afterward began working as an \\"office boy\\" at the New York Times. Within a year, he had begun taking photos for the Times, and in 1955, he was promoted to staff photographer at the paper. He quit working at the Times in 1991 because they wanted to give him a computer.. He has two children, a daughter named Jeanette born in 1951, and a son named John born in 1954. His son, who is gay, has been estranged since he came out to his father in 1975. Recognition Boenzi is a member of the New York Press Photographers Association, and he came in third place in the \\"feature\\" category of their 1973 contest, which honored the best New York photographs of 1972.

The poem was originally written in 1933 and appeared in The American Mercury in April 1934 before being collected in his 1936 book A Further Range. The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.  Composition  Frost composed the poem in the winter of 1933 during bouts of illness and depression. It is one of the poems Frost claims to have written \\"without fumbling a sentence.\\"  Theme and tone  The poem is considered one of Frost's darker and more somber poems, focusing on the terrifying nature of existence. Additional themes are ones of loneliness, fear, and despair. The poem opens with the speaker passing by an empty field during a snowstorm around dusk. As the field is covered with snow, the speaker contemplates the blankness and the whiteness of the snow, a snow \\"with no expression, nothing to express.\\" The speaker then turns his contemplation to the night sky \\"with their empty spaces / Between stars.\\" The poem shares a similar landscape to Frost's poem \\"Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening.\\" The Irish poet Seamus Heaney notes in his essay \\"Above the Brim\\" that the two poems also share a similar rhyme scheme. Heaney also notes that the quick alliteration in the first two lines propel the poem forward.  Critical interpretation  Critics differ on whether or not the poem expresses an argument for faith and God or an argument for skepticism. Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in their book Understanding Poetry, interpret the poem to speak on behalf of faith and belief. Other critics believe the poem embodies the skepticism evident within the New England tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Still others view the poem as more modern and ironic in its approach, comparing the poem to the tradition of William Wordsworth. Most critics agree, however, that Frost establishes a mirroring between the exterior landscape and the interior landscape of the speaker. More recent critics have argued that the poem expresses Frost's lack of faith in his own creative abilities, noting that the lonely and barren landscape mirrors the barrenness of creativity, inspiration, and imagination. Critic Judith Oster, for example, correlates the line \\"nothing to express\\" with Frost's own fear of a loss of creative output.

Henry Charles William Angelo (1756‚Äì1835) was an English memoirist and fencing master, as a member of the Angelo family of fencers and son of the Italian master, Domenico Angelo. As the leader of his father's Angelo School of Arms from 1780 to 1817, he consolidated its status among London's high society, with upper class patronage and a cult of celebrity. He also maintained his family's reputation, reissuing his father's seminal fencing manual and composing several memoirs and a single work on fencing, himself. Biography frontispiece to his Reminiscences of Henry Angelo (1828). Henry Charles William Malevolti was born on 5 April 1756 at St James's Place, Piccadilly, London. His baptismal surname was Malevolti, but in the late 1750s, he became known as Angelo, following his father's adoption of the surname. Angelo was born to the Italian-born fencing master, Domenico Angelo (1717‚Äì1802), and his wife, Elizabeth n√©e Johnson (1738‚Äì1805). This placed Angelo in the second generation of the Angelo Family, a dynasty of fencing masters who \\"dominated Europe's fencing scene for well over 100 years\\", according to fencing master Nick Evangelista. Angelo grew up among four sisters and one brother, as the eldest child of the family. He attended the school is Chiswick, then run by Dr William Rose, then moving to Eton College (where his father taught fencing) as of 1764. In 1772, he began his formal training as a fencer, practicing swordsmanship under a Monsieur Motet in Paris, a man then known in the Continent as \\"the greatest living fencer\\", according to Egerton Castle. By 1775, he had returned to England to become his father's principal assistant. On 23 October 1778, against the wishes of his family, he married Mary Bowman Swindon of West Auckland at St Anne's, Soho. They had their first child in 1799, with the Duke of York agreeing to be the child's godfather (the Duke already being Angelo's reputed godfather). Angelo had four sons, the second of whom, Henry Charles Angelo (1780‚Äì1852), became a fencing master himself, maintaining the family's reputation. 'I shall conquer this', 1787, by Thomas Rowlandson. One of several dramatic prints by Angelo's friend, Rowlandson, depicting Angelo's swordsmanship. In 1780, Domenico Angelo retired from his fencing school, the Angelo School of Arms, and was supplanted by his son, Henry Angelo. Shortly after assuming control, Angelo moved the school's premises to Her Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket. Angelo specialised in cavalry swordsmanship, with his patrons including the London and Westminster Light Horse Volunteers. During his time, Angelo consolidated the academy's status within London high society, utilising a \\"combination of sportsmanship, celebrity, and royal and noble patronage\\", according to Malcolm Fare of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Here, in 1787, Angelo's friend and popular caricaturist, Thomas Rowlandson, produced a set of watercolours depicting Angelo's swordsmanship, illustrating several of his most distinguished students looking on (including Charles James Fox and The Marquess of Buckingham). In 1787, Angelo reissued his father's L'√©cole des armes (1763), with fencing illustrations copied from Diderot's Encyclop√©die, under the title The School of Fencing. This volume has been described by Evangelista \\"the all-time classic volume on the subject of swordplay\\" and \\"a work of immense influence\\". On 17 June 1789, Her Majesty's Theatre was burned down and Angelo was forced to move to new premises, in 13 Bond Street, which he occupied alongside the boxer John Jackson. Angelo did not settle during his final years of teaching, tutoring at around forty schools in total, before an injury by actor Edmund Kean in 1817 forced him into retirement. The management of the school was then passed to his son, Henry Charles Angelo. Angelo died at Twickenham in 1835. In his retirement, Angelo was a memoirist and, like his father, a writer on fencing. In 1817, he reissued his father's School of Fencing, under the title A Treatise on the Utility and Advantages of Fencing, with a biography of his friend, the composer and fencer Chevalier de Saint- Georges, appended. He reminisced of his life in London's high society in two memoirs: The Reminiscences of Henry Angelo (1828) and Angelo's Pic Nic; or, Table Talk (1834), ignoring discussion of fencing career for more conventional anecdotes, many of questionable veracity. Angelo published one original work on fencing, Hungarian and Highland Broadsword (1798), illustrated with 24 watercolours by Rowlandson, many depicting Angelo on horseback.
